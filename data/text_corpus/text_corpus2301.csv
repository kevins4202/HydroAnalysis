cultivated fruit in the world and are grown on nearly every continent faostat 2014 however grapevine production is water intensive and water shortage is the most significant limiting factor of crop production worldwide faostat 2014 the future of sustainable grapevine cultivation is likely to require expansion to more favorable locations or a major reduction in water use flexas et al 2016 while grapevines can be grown in tropical areas such as in brazil the climatic conditions can be even more problematic permanhani et al 2016 due to the intense irregularity of precipitation patters given the requisite climatic conditions and predicted effects of global warming ipcc 2014 the future of grapevine cultivation is uncertain and the use of alternative irrigation techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation rdi and partial root zone drying prd should be explored rdi and prd are two specific deficit irrigation techniques that tune water availability temporally specific timing of the application rdi or spatially alternating dry wet zones prd chaves et al 2010 under rdi the water is supplied at levels below that required for full crop evapotranspiration etc during specific phenological stages particularly after fruit set when fruit growth is less sensitive to reductions in water supply chaves et al 2010 tarara and peña 2015 this technique was designed to optimize fruit number size and quality by balancing vegetative growth and potential for production poni et al 2009 chaves et al 2010 by contrast under prd the two sides of the grapevines root system are alternately irrigated providing a spatial reduction in water availability prd can induce the synthesis of abscisic acid aba by roots in the dried half of the rootzone and lead to partial stomatal closure without reducing overall leaf water status stoll et al 2000 dry and loveys 1998 antolín et al 2006 2008 such reductions in stomatal conductance and transpiration are typically larger than the decrease in net photosynthesis and thus increase water use efficiency without impairing plant development yield or fruit quality de souza et al 2005 chaves et al 2007 pou et al 2012 although both rdi and prd systems can improve water use in plants deficit irrigation responses in grapevines are dependent on specific stress tolerance or avoidance mechanisms schultz 2003 grapevines can have either isohydric or anisohydric behavior depending on the stomatal control strategy presented in response to changes in air vapor pressure deficit vpd and or water availability in the soil schultz 2003 soar et al 2006 chaves et al 2010 tomás et al 2014 lavoie lamoureux et al 2017 in isohydric plants aba accumulation in leaves promotes stomata closure early in response to either decreased water content in the soil or increased vpd so that leaf water potential ψ remains unchanged or slightly decreases schultz 2003 poni et al 2007 lovisolo et al 2010 pou et al 2012 flexas 2016 lavoie lamoureux et al 2017 however foliar aba can also limit leaf gas exchange over the long term by preventing stomatal recovery upon rewatering and resulting in the down regulation of transpiration isohydry may favor embolism repair and preserves water under conditions of fluctuating water availability and repeated drought tombesi et al 2015 on the other hand anisohydric plants have a high tolerance to reduced water availability and do not significantly modify stomatal apertures as ψ varies rogiers et al 2012 palliotti et al 2015 lavoie lamoureux et al 2017 it has been reported that such iso anisohydric behavior is influenced by the specific ambient growth conditions such as hydraulic resistances within the soil plant system plant age and climate schultz 2003 lovisolo et al 2010 chaves et al 2010 hochberg et al 2013 currently there is a demand for knowledge about the ecophysiological responses of grapevine cultivars to a reduction in water availability chaves et al 2010 flexas et al 2010 2016 lavoie lamoureux et al 2017 especially under tropical conditions limitations to plant growth and crop yield imposed by water availability are mainly due to reductions in the carbon balance and therefore dependent on the equilibrium between photosynthesis and respiration poni et al 2009 flexas et al 2006 viticultural methods for reducing water losses through stomata closure without resulting in concomitant reductions in co2 uptake are desired more specifically improving the metabolic efficiency of photosynthesis by increasing rubisco carboxylation capacity could improve the growth of grapevines under limited water conditions flexas et al 2016 much less attention has been given to respiration flexas et al 2006 schultz and stoll 2010 morales et al 2016 despite the fact that leaf respiration occurs continuously and even small changes in this process can result in substantial variation in the plant carbon balance poni et al 2009 flexas et al 2010 griffin and heskel 2013 tomás et al 2014 it has been previously reported that grapevine leaf respiration can increase under moderate water shortage silva et al 2017 and deficit irrigation could result in significant carbon losses through leaf respiration flexas et al 2010 salazar parra et al 2015 moreover it is known that leaf respiration in the light rlight is usually lower than in the dark rdark with the degree of light inhibition responding differently to environmental signals tcherkez et al 2010 such as water availability ayub et al 2011 crous et al 2012 a full understanding of the leaf carbon balance requires that the rate of respiration in both the dark rdark and in the light rlight be quantified parallel to deficit irrigation use protected cultivation using transparent plastic covering tpc is now becoming a common practice in table grapes permanhani et al 2016 tpc has been reported to increase the water use efficiency in grapevines by creating higher humidity and lowering transpiration as compared to open field conditions stanghellini 2014 permanhani et al 2016 higher shoot growth rates leaf areas and chlorophyll contents have been observed in grapevines grown under tpc de souza et al 2015 tpc can also protect a grapevine canopy from adverse meteorological conditions such as wind and rain roberto et al 2011 du et al 2015 permanhani et al 2016 while rainfall increases grapevine vegetative growth it can reduce fruit quality due to imbalances in the sink source ratio monteiro and lopes 2007 chaves et al 2010 moreover leaf wetness caused by rainfall can trigger disease development such as mildew and botrytis leading to use of fungicides and other chemicals botelho et al 2011 pedro et al 2011 de souza et al 2015 permanhani et al 2016 however the use of specific tpc methodologies type of plastic used and distance of canopy can present disadvantages as well such as excessive overheating due to inadequate air circulation liu et al 2012 high temperatures can impair leaf function and alter grape cluster microclimates with a likely negative impact on yield and grape composition permanhani et al 2016 the effects of tpc on grapevines in tropical settings has not been studied but could provide more in depth knowledge about the potential use of this technique for extending the range of grapevine cultivation to the best of our knowledge this is the first work designed to analyze the effects of deficit irrigation on table grapes cultivated in tropical conditions under tpc studies about protected cultivation in grapevines under tropical conditions are scarce moreover the table grapevine cultivar used in the present work niagara rosada is poorly researched even though it is widely accepted by consumers and therefore widely cultivated in brazil thus we undertook an investigation to answer the following set of questions regarding the niagara rosada grapevine grown under tropical conditions i does this genotype present an anisohydric or an isohydric behavior ii how does deficit irrigation affect leaf ψ iii can rdi and prd increase the ratio of anet gs and improve water use efficiency anet e iv how does deficit irrigation affect the photochemical and biochemical capacity of the grapevine v what are the effects of deficit irrigation on leaf respiration rates and leaf carbon balance vi is it possible to save water without affecting yield and fruit quality vii is polyethylene plastic covering an effective strategy to cultivate niagara rosada grapevine in tropical conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 field conditions and plant material the research was conducted in a commercial vineyard at tabuinha farm located in são fidelis city northern rio de janeiro state brazil 21 30 58 s and 41 42 49 6 w the climate of the region is wet tropical with a rainy summer and a dry winter according to esteves 2015 the soil is classified as a red yellow argisol and at a depth of 0 40 cm the soil presents 639 0 g kg 1 of sand 73 5 g kg 1 of silt 288 5 g kg 1 of clay and total porosity of 0 4 m3 m 3 the study was carried out during two seasons from december 2015 to march 2016 summer first season and from august 2016 to december 2016 spring second season niagara rosada vitis labrusca grapevines grafted on iac 766 rootstock were used the vineyard has a planting density of 1850 plants per hectare with grapevines spaced 2 0 m within and 2 7 m between rows 5 4 m2 plant 1 plants have been trained on a bilateral cordon system using a horizontal shoot positioning with two pairs of wires one pair on each side of the cordons set perpendicularly to shoot s growth and parallel to cordons growth mixed pruning was performed so that the mean bud number retained per cane was two on the first season summer short spurs and between six to eight on the second season spring long spurs shoots were trimmed at 0 30 m away from the outermost wire ca 35 days after the first production pruning standard cultural practices in the region were applied to all plants thirty days before pruning 10 15 l of cattle manure were applied per plant on both seasons after pruning six soil fertilizations were made corresponding to a total of 230 kg of n 170 kg of p2o5 and 140 kg of k2o ha 1 season 1 2 2 climate variables polyethylene plastic cover and water management treatments the experimental site was equally divided in two so that one half was covered with two tpc measuring 187 5 m2 each total of 375 0 m2 each structure had an arch shaped ceiling with uv protection provided by a 150 0 μm thick polyethylene plastic positioned 6 0 m from the ground and 4 m from the canopy the sides were closed with anti bird screen and galvanized gutters were used to prevent rainwater entrance under the cover structure plants cultivated on the other one half of the experimental site uncovered were all protected with black anti bird screen 0 5 m from canopy climate variables were monitored in both the covered and uncovered site air temperature and relative humidity were recorded using a data logger model 200 spectrum technologies plainfield illinois usa photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd was monitored with a quantum light sensor model lightscout spectrum technologies plainfield illinois usa and recorded with a datalogger watch dog model 200 spectrum technologies plainfield illinois usa both positioned at the top of grapevine canopies within each site data was collected each 30 min air vpd was calculated according to jones 1992 water was supplied according to the crop evapotranspiration etc calculated with the equation proposed by hargreaves and samani 1985 and corrected with the crop coefficients estimated by esteves 2015 for different phenological stages two irrigation systems were used throughout the experiment the first one was used for 71 and 64 days on the first summer and second spring season respectively between pruning and fruit set bunch closure stage number 33 according to the grapevine development classification of eichhorn and lorenz 1977 so that all plants were equally irrigated with drip emitters two per plant operating at 4 0 l h 1 and positioned 0 5 m from the vine trunk distributed on both sides of the root system thereafter using the second irrigation system both covered and uncovered plants were exposed to one of three water management treatments 1 full irrigated fi 100 of the etc was supplied simultaneously to both sides of the root system with four drip emitters two drippers on each side of the root system operating at 3 8 l h 1 2 regulated deficit irrigation rdi 50 of the etc was supplied simultaneously to both sides of the root system with two drip emitters one dripper on each side of the root system operation at 3 8 l h 1 and 3 partial rootzone drying prd 50 of etc was supplied to only one side of the root system with 2 drip emitters operating at 3 8 l h 1 whereas the other side of the rootzone remained without water the treatment was reversed every 15 days and the alternate side of the root system received water thus six plants of each water management treatment were grown in each of the two sites covered and uncovered such water management treatments were applied from fruit set to harvest for 42 and 54 days days after initiating treatments dait on the first and second season respectively and total water amount applied during each period were recorded overall plants were irrigated three times a week throughout both seasons the rainfall over the uncovered site was monitored using a pluviometer cumulative rainfall after initiating treatments was 110 and 240 l m 2 during the first and second seasons respectively during the first season volumetric soil moisture was monitored every 15 dait at a depth of 0 2 m 0 5 m from the vine trunk using a soil moisture probe extech instruments usa model number mo750 during the second season soil water potential was recorded using a soil matric potential sensor model mps 6 decagon devices pullman wa usa and watermark 200ss irrometer co riverside ca usa placed at a depth of 0 4 m 0 5 m from the vine trunk the sensors were coupled to a em50 data collection system decagon devices pullman wa usa and watermark 200ss irrometer co riverside ca usa so that the data were stored every 30 min overall both volumetric soil moisture and soil water potential were measured in one randomly selected plant per treatment while for prd measurements were taken on both sides of the root system prd 1 side that received the first irrigation shift and prd 2 side that first remained without water 2 3 gas exchange overall the gas exchange measurements and other analyses outlined below were made on one fully expanded well exposed leaf opposite to the first cluster of the first cane in each plant gas exchange parameters were obtained on the 0 15th and 30th dait of the first season summer and on the 15th 30th and 45th dait of the second season spring between 08 00 and 12 00 h light response curves of net photosynthetic rate a net were made using a li cor 6400xt portable photosynthesis system li cor inc lincoln ne usa as described in shapiro et al 2004 and taking into consideration the precautions of pons and welschen 2002 the system incorporated a co2 controller which was used to set the co2 concentration inside the li cor cuvette at 400 μl l 1 the 6 cm2 cuvette was fitted with a red blue light source 6400 02b the net photosynthetic rate anet stomatal conductance gs transpiration rate e and the internal to ambient co2 concentration ratio ci ca all at 1500 μmol m 2 s 1 photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd were determined from the light response curves with 24 levels of ppfd 1500 1200 800 500 200 100 90 80 70 and every 5 ppfd between 70 and 0 μmol m 2 s 1 the rate of respiration in the dark rdark was taken as the value of a net at 0 μmol m 2 s 1 ppfd rate of respiration in the light rlight was estimated using the method originally described in kok 1948 as the y axis intercept of a first order linear regression fitted to anet irradiance plots to measurements made over the 25 65 μmol m 2 s 1 irradiance range all gas exchange data were corrected for the increase in intercellular co2 concentrations c i with decreasing irradiance which can result in reduced rates of photorespiration and increased rates of carboxylation villar et al 1994 the correction was applied by adjusting the rlight through iteration to minimize the intercept of photosynthetic electron transport j as a function of irradiance kirschbaum and farquhar 1987 j was calculated according to farquhar and von caemmerer 1982 1 j 4 a n e t r l i g h t c

were used to calculate the water use efficiency anet e and the intrinsic water use efficiency a net g s in addition leaf carbon balance lcb for the experiment was estimated using the following equation 8 l c b a n e t r d a r k r l i g h t all gas exchange measurements were taken at a relative humidity of approximately 65 75 by manipulating the amount of air passing through a drying column prior to entering the leaf cuvette the li cor cuvette block temperature was set to 30 c for all measurements to account for the influences of leaf temperature on gas exchange variables in addition the flow rate was kept at 300 μmol m 2 s 1 2 4 spad values and chlorophyll a fluorescence spad values and chlorophyll a fluorescence were measured on the same intact leaves used for gas exchange measurements and on the same days between 08 00 and 10 00 h five spad values were averaged in the same sampled leaf using the spad 502 chlorophyll meter minolta co ltd osaka japan maximum quantum

of a leaf covered with liquid paraffin applied below the leaf which avoided transpiration increased leaf temperature while twet is the temperature of a leaf sprayed with fresh water reduced leaf temperature tleaf values that are close to twet will result in high cwsi values which are indicative of intense transpiration when a plant is transpiring fully the leaf temperature is 1 4 below air temperature and the cwsi is close to 1 as the transpiration decreases the leaf temperature rises and can reach to 4 6 above air temperature when the plant is no longer transpiring the cwsi is close to 0 2 6 leaf water potential leaf water potential ψ was measured immediately after leaf excision at pre dawn ψpd and midday ψmd according to schölander et al 1965 using a pressure chamber model 1000 pms

with a refractometer model atago n1 e atago co ltd itabashi ku tokyo japan these same 10 berries were then manually macerated and 5 ml of juice were added to 45 ml of deionized water in order to measure the ph using a digital ph meter model qa400se quimis diadema são paulo brazil total acidity was obtained by titration with naoh as recommended by oiv 1990 and the relation between total

there were non statistical trends towards higher tleaf ca 6 and lower cwsi values ca 11 in covered plants relative to uncovered plants throughout both seasons table 2 no significant differences were found for either season in anet gs and anet e among water management treatments in covered fig 2 a and d fig 3 a and c and uncovered fig 2 b and e sites throughout the experiment regardless of water management treatments there were non statistical trends for higher anet gs ca 12 7 fig 2 c and fig 3 b and anet e ratios ca 14 8 fig 2 f and fig 3 d in covered plants than the uncovered plants throughout both seasons and measurement days spad values were not affected by the tpc or by reducing water supply through either rdi or prd supplementary table s1 similarly photochemical capacity was not influenced by either water management treatments or tpc use and thus significant differences in chlorophyll fluorescence variables were not observed and fv fm values remained higher than 0 81 at the end of each season for all treatments supplementary table s1 reducing water supply through either rdi or prd in both sites as well as using tpc regardless water management treatments did not significantly change rdark rlight and rlight rdark in relation to fi and uncovered conditions respectively throughout both seasons figs 4 and 5 likewise lcb did not significantly vary in response to treatments applied during the entire experiment figs 6 and 7 during the 42 dait of the first season 154 3 and 150 4 l of water were saved per plant in the covered and uncovered sites respectively when either rdi or prd was applied fig 8 a and c likewise during the second season these water management treatments rdi and prd reduced the amount of water applied per plant by 195 4 and 184 5 l in the covered and uncovered sites respectively throughout the 54 dait period fig 8 b and d considering a planting density of 1850 grapevines per hectare 323 38 and 310 31 m3 of water per hectare covered and uncovered sites respectively can be saved each season when either rdi or prd is used from fruit set to harvest of niagara rosada grapevine cultivated under the experimental conditions used in this work the reductions in water applied through the use of either rdi or prd did not affect any of the fruit quality parameters analyzed in either the covered or uncovered sites in either seasons supplementary table s2 moreover there were no negative effects of tpc on fruit quality or yield supplementary table s2 4 discussion 4 1 anisohydric behavior of niagara rosada grapevine grapevines show various strategies known as stress tolerance or avoidance mechanisms so that different cultivars have been classified as either anisohydric or isohydric in response to changes in air vdp and or water availability schultz 2003 soar et al 2006 chaves et al 2010 tomás et al 2014 lavoie lamoureux et al 2017 under the tropical experimental conditions studied niagara rosada grapevine presented anisohydric behavior plants from all water management treatments including fi plants showed reduced ψ as air vpd increased at midday ψmd in both sites resulting in a considerably high ψdrop table 1 and a strong negative linear relationship between ψ and air vpd fig 1 indeed anisohydric plants tend to show variable ψ values in response to increased evaporative demand so that ψmd is substantially lower than ψpd schultz 2003 chaumont and tyerman 2014 despite such anisohydric behavior no effects on ψpd ψmd and ψdrop were observed when either rdi or prd was used in both sites table 1 maintaining similar ψ values regardless of water availability is typically achieved by reducing gs in isohydric plants poni et al 2007 lovisolo et al 2010 pou et al 2012 flexas 2016 lavoie lamoureux et al 2017 aba accumulation in leaves can promote early stomatal closure in response to decreased soil water content and thereby reduce water loss and preserve ψ schultz 2003 pou et al 2012 tombesi et al 2015 however this mechanism was not observed in the present study and neither gs nor e were reduced when deficit irrigation treatments were applied table 2 instead our results indicate that although the soil water content of both rdi and prd decreased considerably in relation to fi supplementary figs s3 and s4 in tpc area ψ did not change table 1 and the resulting water availability was sufficient to maintain the plants internal water status green et al 1997 observed in mature apple trees that previously dehydrated roots responded to irrigation by exhibiting higher sap flow rates than occurs when the entire root zone is watered this increase in root hydraulic conductivity seems to be mediated by aquaporin activity lovisolo and schubert 2006 thus we speculate that factors other than the stomatal control are likely to be involved in the observed response of ψ among water management treatments in the anisohydric niagara rosada grapevine lavoie lamoureux et al 2017 such as up regulation of aquaporin expression vandeleur et al 2009 vitali et al 2016 water redistribution within the plant via lateral flow between vessels in both radial and tangential directions halis et al 2012 and or osmotic adjustment patakas and noitsakis 1999 4 2 water use efficiency and intrinsic water use efficiency in grapevine exposed to deficit irrigation in tropical conditions anisohydric plants show high tolerance to reduced water availability and close their stomata at water potentials well below those of well watered plants soar et al 2006 lavoie lamoureux et al 2017 for this reason anisohydric grapevines can maintain photosynthetic rates at high levels under conditions of low water availability in the soil flexas et al 2006 palliotti et al 2015 in the present work conducted under tropical conditions anet did not change when both rdi and prd were used regardless of site table 2 since both gs and e did not vary among water management treatments no significant differences in anet gs fig 2 a and b fig 3 a or in anet e fig 2 d and e fig 3 c were observed in either site curiously in grapevines rdi and prd are usually associated with a larger reduction in gs and e than in anet resulting in increased anet gs de souza et al 2005 chaves et al 2007 pou et al 2012 hochberg et al 2013 and anet e de souza et al 2005 chaves et al 2007 however this trend was not observed in the present work or in our previous growth chamber study silva et al 2017 in general these effects are not as pronounced in anisohydric as they are in isohydric plants since the stomatal responses of isohydric plants to reduced water availability are typically stronger poni et al 2007 lovisolo et al 2010 pou et al 2012 flexas 2016 lavoie lamoureux et al 2017 our observed responses of both anet gs and anet e corroborate with our δ13c results since significant variation was not observed among water management treatments at the end of the second season in either sites table 2 previous work found that plants grown under reduced water availability had a less negative δ13c when gs was lower de souza et al 2005 chaves et al 2007 and therefore both anet gs and anet e were higher condon et al 2004 an affect not observed in the present work table 2 fig 2 a b d and e fig 3 a and c moreover considering that δ13c integrates photosynthetic activity throughout the period over which the tissue was synthesized salazar parra et al 2015 and reflects the interplay among all aspects of plant carbon and water relations aranjuelo et al 2009 we can assume that neither rdi or prd cause damage to the capacity for co2 assimilation in niagara rosada grapevines grown under tropical conditions 4 3 effects of deficit irrigation on biochemical and photochemical traits of grapevine grown in tropical conditions although a restricted co2 supply is considered an important cause for decreased photosynthetic rates under reduced water availability flexas et al 2006 the amount of carbon assimilated is strongly driven by the leaf biochemical potential flexas et al 2016 in the present work vc1500 as well as vo1500 did not vary among the water management treatments regardless of site or season table 2 by closing stomata later in response to reduced water availability anisohydric plants delay metabolic limitations flexas et al 2006 pou et al 2012 palliotti et al 2015 and maintain the activity of calvin cycle enzymes de souza et al 2005 as observed in the present work through vc1500 and vo1500 values table 2 these results demonstrate that the affinity of rubisco to co2 was not affected by either rdi and prd gago et al 2014 galmés et al 2014 2015 flexas et al 2016 under tropical conditions a desirable feature that matches photoprotection with a positive carbon assimilation hochberg et al 2013 the non variable ci ca values table 2 demonstrates that co2 accumulation in the mesophyll did not occur in either rdi or prd treatments and thus the overall activity of the calvin cycle enzymes was stable regardless of water availability de souza et al 2005 therefore both rdi and prd can be used for niagara rosada grapevine cultivation under the experimental conditions of this work without harming the biochemical potential for photosynthesis leaf photochemistry is co regulated with rubisco content and or activity through feed back or feed forward changes in redox balance homeostasis via photosynthetic control foyer et al 1990 galmés et al 2013 since neither rdi or prd caused biochemical impairments on niagara rosada photosynthesis no damage to chlorophyll biosynthesis or breakdown was observed as indicated by the spad values not being affected by water management treatments supplementary table s1 hence regardless of site no effects of either rdi or prd on pi sm rc cs0 et0 tr et0 abs or di cs0 were shown in both seasons supplementary table s1 moreover the fv fm ratio an important variable which provides a measure of the rate of linear electron transport jamil et al 2007 tang et al 2007 balouchi 2010 was higher than 0 81 at the end of both seasons in all treatments supplementary table s1 thus the psii reaction centers of niagara rosada grapevine show no indication of damage or inactivation zlatev 2009 vaz and sharma 2011 and there was no apparent blockage of electron transfer between the acceptors shu et al 2012 as the result of the applied reduction in water availability in tropical conditions studied indeed metabolic impairment on biochemical and photochemical capacity of photosynthesis has been shown to occur only when stomatal conductance drops below 0 05 0 10 mol h2o m 2 s 1 bota et al 2004 flexas et al 2006 which did not occur in our experiment table 2 considering that climate change will likely enhance the severity of drought ipcc 2014 anisohydric grapevines that do not reduce gs in response to reduced water availability can to avoid biochemical or photochemical damage pou et al 2012 palliotti et al 2015 and thus should be preferentially cultivated in tropical regions 4 4 respiration and leaf carbon balance in grapevines deficit irrigated analyzing all the physiological processes involved in c metabolism can be extremely difficult morales et al 2016 however both photosynthesis and respiration are basic components of plant productivity that should be considered together in grapevines ecophysiological studies schultz and stoll 2010 it has been previously reported that r in grapevines can increase under moderate water shortage silva et al 2017 suggesting that deficit irrigation could result in increased carbon losses flexas et al 2010 salazar parra et al 2015 increased respiratory carbon losses were not observed in the present study and reducing water supply with either rdi or prd did not significantly change rdark or rlight in relation to fi in either seasons figs 4 a b d and e fig 5 a and c indeed leaf respiration can be strongly enhanced by increases in tleaf caused by reduced transpiration when water availability is reduced flexas et al 2010 a condition not observed in the present work regardless of site table 2 instead in the anisohydric niagara rosada grapevines neither gs or e were reduced by deficit irrigation rdi and prd table 2 and tleaf was unaffected by the water management treatments table 2 rlight rdark was not affected by reduced water availability through either rdi or prd treatments in either site figs 4 g and h fig 5 e this response is related to the anisohydric behavior as well in general rlight rdark is directly related to changes in vo so that conditions which increase vo can also increase rlight rdark due to high demand for tca cycle substrates associated with the recovery of photorespiratory cycle intermediates in the peroxisome tcherkez et al 2008 griffin and turnbul 2013 since anisohydric plants delay metabolic limitations by closing the stomata later in response to reduced water availability flexas et al 2006 pou et al 2012 both rdi and prd did not cause significant effects on vo1500 table 2 and thereby no effects on rlight rdark were observed during either season in both sites figs 4 g and h fig 5 e in order to analyze the effectiveness of deficit irrigation use in grapevines grown in a given region the lcb must be assessed the potential limitations imposed by reduced water availability are primarily dependent on the balance between photosynthesis and respiration flexas et al 2006 in the present work regardless of site the lcb did not vary significantly in response to either rdi or prd in relation to fi throughout the entire experiment fig 6 a and b fig 7 a again this response was caused by the anisohydric behavior of niagara rosada which resulted in unchanged rates of anet table 2 rlight and rdark figs 4 a b d and e fig 5 a and c since lcb is directly proportional to carbon available for plant s growth and yield flexas et al 2006 escalona et al 2012 ayub et al 2014 we can assume that the use of deficit irrigation techniques in anisohydric grapevines such as niagara rosada will not result in a substantial reduction in carbon gain under tropical climates 4 5 effects of deficit irrigation on grapevine s fruit quality and yield in tropical conditions the use of rdi or prd in tropically grown grapevines saved a considerable amount of water both with and without tpc fig 8 our trials suggest that more than 310 m3 of water can be saved per hectare each season when either rdi or prd is applied from fruit set to harvest of niagara rosada importantly the reduced water supply had no negative effects on niagara rosada s yield or fruit quality if the water management treatments are started after fruit set supplementary table s2 at this developmental stage the berry s connectivity to the vine is via the phloem thomas et al 2006 tarara and peña 2015 and any reduction in berry size or quality would be indirectly related to decreases in photosynthesis wang et al 2003 however negative effects on photosynthesis were not observed in the present work and both anet and vc1500 values remained unchanged table 2 similarly photochemical capacity was not affected by either rdi or prd treatments supplementary table s1 as a result it should not be surprising that yield and fruit quality were unaffected supplementary table s2 moreover reductions in yield and changes in fruit quality are commonly associated with increased aba synthesis under deficit irrigation deluc et al 2009 chaves et al 2010 aba limits cell division and consequently grapevines produce small berries and have reduced yields chaves et al 2010 an increase of aba in the leaves of table grapes has also been associated with the accumulation of leaf hexose deluc et al 2009 as a means of controlling sugar transport to grape berries lecourieux et al 2010 finally aba has also been associated with the regulation of anthocyanin synthesis and accumulation in the skin of the fruit peppi et al 2006 lund et al 2008 deluc et al 2009 chaves et al 2010 however the anisohydric behavior of niagara rosada grapevine limited aba synthesis and accumulation poni et al 2007 lovisolo et al 2010 pou et al 2012 flexas 2016 lavoie lamoureux et al 2017 as indicated by the stable gs values among the various water management treatments in our trials table 2 therefore regardless of site there were no effects of either prd or rdi on yield and quality parameters of niagara rosada grapevine under tropical conditions supplementary table s2 no differences were found between rdi and prd treatments for any of traits analyzed in the present work suggesting that both water management techniques can be useful alternatives to save water in grapevines cultivated in tropical conditions particularly for anisohydric cultivars however as previously reported dos santos et al 2003 gu et al 2004 intrigliolo and castel 2009 collins et al 2010 the total cost of the irrigation system and not just the method of application should be considered since prd requires twice the amount of tubing as rdi it incurs higher installation and maintenance costs permanhani et al 2016 and thus rdi may economically preferred 4 6 use of transparent plastic covering tpc regardless of water management treatments plants grown in the covered site trended towards higher anet gs fig 2 c and fig 3 b and anet e fig 2 f and fig 3 d during both seasons as a result of having lower gs and e values respectively table 2 tpc is known to effect both anet e and anet gs in table grapes permanhani et al 2016 by altering the microclimate deluc et al 2009 roberto et al 2011 and increasing leaf surface temperatures liu et al 2012 in the present work despite significant within and between season variation in climatic conditions supplementary figs s1 and s2 there was a consistent tendency for covered plants to have slightly higher tleaf table 2 and lower cwsi c a 11 2 table 2 cwsi is typically related to stomatal regulation and thus can affect plant energy balance grant et al 2007 vaz et al 2016 in our experiments gs and e were both reduced table 2 leading to a positive effect of tpc on anet gs fig 2 c and fig 3 b and on anet e fig 2 f and fig 3 d concomitantly discrimination against 13c was reduced and less negative δ13c values were observed in covered plants at the end of the second season in response to reduced gs table 2 such negative δ13c values are typically associated with higher water use efficiency condon et al 2004 a typical trend observed throughout the entire experiment in the covered site table 2 fig 2 c and f fig 3 b and d covered plants tended towards lower ci ca ratios table 2 indicating stomatal limitation of photosynthesis the slightly reduced gs of covered plants table 2 was compensated by higher rubisco carboxylation rates in plants from the covered site represented by vc1500 values table 2 rubisco kinetics and maximum activity are directly affected by leaf temperature gago et al 2014 galmés et al 2014 2015 flexas et al 2016 and the higher tleaf of the covered plants table 2 increased both vc1500 and vo1500 table 2 it is important to consider that although photorespiration can diminish the potential photosynthetic activity of plants salazar parra et al 2015 the simultaneous increase of photorespiration and photosynthesis as observed in the present work in covered plants table 2 provides an avoidance mechanism against photoinhibition maintaining a positive carbon balance hochberg et al 2013 indeed photosynthetic activity was positively rather than negatively affected by the tpc and slightly higher anet values were observed in plants grown under the covering table 2 the use of tpc to cultivate niagara rosada grapevine in a tropical area had no negative effects on photochemical capacity supplementary table s1 or on leaf respiration rates fig 4 c f and i fig 5 b d and f and lcb fig 6 c fig 7 b furthermore fruit quality and yield were maintained during both seasons supplementary table s2 although excessive rainfall can damage grape production in this region particularly during summer this did not occur over the duration of our experiments however tpc can minimize negative effects of heavy rains on fruit quality monteiro and lopes 2007 chaves et al 2010 and reduce fungicide use by preventing the development disease trigged by leaf wetness such as mildew and botrytis botelho et al 2011 pedro et al 2011 in the present work the plants grown in uncovered area received 3 times more pesticides than the tpc plants data not showed therefore the use of tpc can be a beneficial strategy for niagara rosada grapevines grown in wet tropical regions clearly further studies focused on phytosanitary and its economic impacts are needed to give more details about the effectiveness of tpc use in tropical areas 5 conclusions our work growing niagara rosada grapevine in tropical conditions demonstrates that i although the grapevine presents an anisohydric behavior ii deficit irrigation treatments do not affect ψ although leaf water potential was affected by air vpd iii neither rdi nor prd had significant effects on either anet gs or anet e in anisohydric grapevine iv by not closing stomata in response to reduced water availability limitations on both carboxylation reactions of photosynthesis and rubisco oxygenation rates are not observed and the photochemical capacity is not inhibited v leaf respiration rates are not affected by either rdi of prd since deficit irrigation in anisohydric grapevine does not limit vo1500 rlight rdark is not changed the use of either rdi or prd does not reduce carbon gain and lcb is not affected vi considerable amounts of water are saved when either rdi or prd is used from fruit set to harvest without affecting yield and fruit quality rdi is the preferable treatment method for practical reasons vii the use of tpc can be an effective strategy for growing niagara rosada grapevines in wet tropical areas since it avoids the negative effects of heavy rains on fruit quality and limits the development of disease caused by leaf wetness while showing the potential to improve anet e anet gs and vc1500

11505,we examined the interactive effects of deficit irrigation and transparent plastic covering tpc on key physiological traits in tropically grown grapevines niagara rosada grapevine vitis labrusca

cultivated fruit in the world and are grown on nearly every continent faostat 2014 however grapevine production is water intensive and water shortage is the most significant limiting factor of crop production worldwide faostat 2014 the future of sustainable grapevine cultivation is likely to require expansion to more favorable locations or a major reduction in water use flexas et al 2016 while grapevines can be grown in tropical areas such as in brazil the climatic conditions can be even more problematic permanhani et al 2016 due to the intense irregularity of precipitation patters given the requisite climatic conditions and predicted effects of global warming ipcc 2014 the future of grapevine cultivation is uncertain and the use of alternative irrigation techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation rdi and partial root zone drying prd should be explored rdi and prd are two specific deficit irrigation techniques that tune water availability temporally specific timing of the application rdi or spatially alternating dry wet zones prd chaves et al 2010 under rdi the water is supplied at levels below that required for full crop evapotranspiration etc during specific phenological stages particularly after fruit set when fruit growth is less sensitive to reductions in water supply chaves et al 2010 tarara and peña 2015 this technique was designed to optimize fruit number size and quality by balancing vegetative growth and potential for production poni et al 2009 chaves et al 2010 by contrast under prd the two sides of the grapevines root system are alternately irrigated providing a spatial reduction in water availability prd can induce the synthesis of abscisic acid aba by roots in the dried half of the rootzone and lead to partial stomatal closure without reducing overall leaf water status stoll et al 2000 dry and loveys 1998 antolín et al 2006 2008 such reductions in stomatal conductance and transpiration are typically larger than the decrease in net photosynthesis and thus increase water use efficiency without impairing plant development yield or fruit quality de souza et al 2005 chaves et al 2007 pou et al 2012 although both rdi and prd systems can improve water use in plants deficit irrigation responses in grapevines are dependent on specific stress tolerance or avoidance mechanisms schultz 2003 grapevines can have either isohydric or anisohydric behavior depending on the stomatal control strategy presented in response to changes in air vapor pressure deficit vpd and or water availability in the soil schultz 2003 soar et al 2006 chaves et al 2010 tomás et al 2014 lavoie lamoureux et al 2017 in isohydric plants aba accumulation in leaves promotes stomata closure early in response to either decreased water content in the soil or increased vpd so that leaf water potential ψ remains unchanged or slightly decreases schultz 2003 poni et al 2007 lovisolo et al 2010 pou et al 2012 flexas 2016 lavoie lamoureux et al 2017 however foliar aba can also limit leaf gas exchange over the long term by preventing stomatal recovery upon rewatering and resulting in the down regulation of transpiration isohydry may favor embolism repair and preserves water under conditions of fluctuating water availability and repeated drought tombesi et al 2015 on the other hand anisohydric plants have a high tolerance to reduced water availability and do not significantly modify stomatal apertures as ψ varies rogiers et al 2012 palliotti et al 2015 lavoie lamoureux et al 2017 it has been reported that such iso anisohydric behavior is influenced by the specific ambient growth conditions such as hydraulic resistances within the soil plant system plant age and climate schultz 2003 lovisolo et al 2010 chaves et al 2010 hochberg et al 2013 currently there is a demand for knowledge about the ecophysiological responses of grapevine cultivars to a reduction in water availability chaves et al 2010 flexas et al 2010 2016 lavoie lamoureux et al 2017 especially under tropical conditions limitations to plant growth and crop yield imposed by water availability are mainly due to reductions in the carbon balance and therefore dependent on the equilibrium between photosynthesis and respiration poni et al 2009 flexas et al 2006 viticultural methods for reducing water losses through stomata closure without resulting in concomitant reductions in co2 uptake are desired more specifically improving the metabolic efficiency of photosynthesis by increasing rubisco carboxylation capacity could improve the growth of grapevines under limited water conditions flexas et al 2016 much less attention has been given to respiration flexas et al 2006 schultz and stoll 2010 morales et al 2016 despite the fact that leaf respiration occurs continuously and even small changes in this process can result in substantial variation in the plant carbon balance poni et al 2009 flexas et al 2010 griffin and heskel 2013 tomás et al 2014 it has been previously reported that grapevine leaf respiration can increase under moderate water shortage silva et al 2017 and deficit irrigation could result in significant carbon losses through leaf respiration flexas et al 2010 salazar parra et al 2015 moreover it is known that leaf respiration in the light rlight is usually lower than in the dark rdark with the degree of light inhibition responding differently to environmental signals tcherkez et al 2010 such as water availability ayub et al 2011 crous et al 2012 a full understanding of the leaf carbon balance requires that the rate of respiration in both the dark rdark and in the light rlight be quantified parallel to deficit irrigation use protected cultivation using transparent plastic covering tpc is now becoming a common practice in table grapes permanhani et al 2016 tpc has been reported to increase the water use efficiency in grapevines by creating higher humidity and lowering transpiration as compared to open field conditions stanghellini 2014 permanhani et al 2016 higher shoot growth rates leaf areas and chlorophyll contents have been observed in grapevines grown under tpc de souza et al 2015 tpc can also protect a grapevine canopy from adverse meteorological conditions such as wind and rain roberto et al 2011 du et al 2015 permanhani et al 2016 while rainfall increases grapevine vegetative growth it can reduce fruit quality due to imbalances in the sink source ratio monteiro and lopes 2007 chaves et al 2010 moreover leaf wetness caused by rainfall can trigger disease development such as mildew and botrytis leading to use of fungicides and other chemicals botelho et al 2011 pedro et al 2011 de souza et al 2015 permanhani et al 2016 however the use of specific tpc methodologies type of plastic used and distance of canopy can present disadvantages as well such as excessive overheating due to inadequate air circulation liu et al 2012 high temperatures can impair leaf function and alter grape cluster microclimates with a likely negative impact on yield and grape composition permanhani et al 2016 the effects of tpc on grapevines in tropical settings has not been studied but could provide more in depth knowledge about the potential use of this technique for extending the range of grapevine cultivation to the best of our knowledge this is the first work designed to analyze the effects of deficit irrigation on table grapes cultivated in tropical conditions under tpc studies about protected cultivation in grapevines under tropical conditions are scarce moreover the table grapevine cultivar used in the present work niagara rosada is poorly researched even though it is widely accepted by consumers and therefore widely cultivated in brazil thus we undertook an investigation to answer the following set of questions regarding the niagara rosada grapevine grown under tropical conditions i does this genotype present an anisohydric or an isohydric behavior ii how does deficit irrigation affect leaf ψ iii can rdi and prd increase the ratio of anet gs and improve water use efficiency anet e iv how does deficit irrigation affect the photochemical and biochemical capacity of the grapevine v what are the effects of deficit irrigation on leaf respiration rates and leaf carbon balance vi is it possible to save water without affecting yield and fruit quality vii is polyethylene plastic covering an effective strategy to cultivate niagara rosada grapevine in tropical conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 field conditions and plant material the research was conducted in a commercial vineyard at tabuinha

2015 the soil is classified as a red yellow argisol and at a depth of 0 40 cm the soil presents 639 0 g kg 1 of sand 73 5 g kg 1 of silt 288 5 g kg 1 of clay and total porosity of 0 4 m3 m 3 the study was carried out during two seasons from december 2015 to march 2016 summer first season and from august 2016 to december 2016 spring second season niagara rosada vitis labrusca grapevines grafted on iac 766 rootstock were used the vineyard has a planting density of 1850 plants per hectare with grapevines spaced 2 0 m within and 2 7 m between rows 5 4 m2 plant 1 plants have been trained on a bilateral cordon system using a horizontal shoot positioning with two pairs of wires one pair on each side of the cordons set perpendicularly to shoot s growth and parallel to cordons growth mixed pruning was performed so that the mean bud number retained per cane was two on the first season summer short spurs and between six to eight on the second season spring long spurs shoots were trimmed at 0 30 m away from the outermost wire ca 35 days after the first production pruning standard cultural practices in the region were applied to all plants thirty days before pruning 10 15 l of cattle manure were applied per plant on both seasons after pruning six soil fertilizations were made corresponding to a total of 230 kg of n 170 kg of p2o5 and 140 kg of k2o ha 1 season 1 2 2 climate variables polyethylene plastic cover and water management treatments the experimental site was equally divided in two so that one half was covered with two tpc measuring 187 5 m2 each total of 375 0 m2 each structure had an arch shaped ceiling with uv protection provided by a 150 0 μm thick polyethylene plastic positioned 6 0 m from the ground and 4 m from the canopy the sides were closed with anti bird screen and galvanized gutters were used to prevent rainwater entrance under the cover structure plants cultivated on the other one half of the experimental site uncovered were all protected with black anti bird screen 0 5 m from canopy climate variables were monitored in both the covered and uncovered site air temperature and relative humidity were recorded using a data logger model 200 spectrum technologies plainfield illinois usa photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd was monitored with a quantum light sensor model lightscout spectrum technologies plainfield illinois usa and recorded with a datalogger watch dog model 200 spectrum technologies plainfield illinois usa both positioned at the top of grapevine canopies within each site data was collected each 30 min air vpd was calculated according to jones 1992 water was supplied according to the crop evapotranspiration etc calculated with the equation proposed by hargreaves and samani 1985 and corrected with the crop coefficients estimated by esteves 2015 for different phenological stages two irrigation systems were used throughout the experiment the first one was used for 71 and 64 days on the first summer and second spring season respectively between pruning and fruit set bunch closure stage number 33 according to the grapevine development classification of eichhorn and lorenz 1977 so that all plants were equally irrigated with drip emitters two per plant operating at 4 0 l h 1 and positioned 0 5 m from the vine trunk distributed on both sides of the root system thereafter using the second irrigation system both covered and uncovered plants were exposed to one of three water management treatments 1 full irrigated fi 100 of the etc was supplied simultaneously to both sides of the root system with four drip emitters two drippers on each side of the root system operating at 3 8 l h 1 2 regulated deficit irrigation rdi 50 of the etc was supplied simultaneously to both sides of the root system with two drip emitters one dripper on each side of the root system operation at 3 8 l h 1 and 3 partial rootzone drying prd 50 of etc was supplied to only one side of the root system with 2 drip emitters operating at 3 8 l h 1 whereas the other side of the rootzone remained without water the treatment was reversed every 15 days and the alternate side of the root system received water thus six plants of each water management treatment were grown in each of the two sites covered and uncovered such water management treatments were applied from fruit set to harvest for 42 and 54 days days after initiating treatments dait on the first and second season respectively and total water amount applied during each period were recorded overall plants were irrigated three times a week throughout both seasons the rainfall over the uncovered site was monitored using a pluviometer cumulative rainfall after initiating treatments was 110 and 240 l m 2 during the first and second seasons respectively during the first season volumetric soil moisture was monitored every 15 dait at a depth of 0 2 m 0 5 m from the vine trunk using a soil moisture probe extech instruments usa model number mo750 during the second season soil water potential was recorded using a soil matric potential sensor model mps 6 decagon devices pullman wa usa and watermark 200ss irrometer co riverside ca usa placed at a depth of 0 4 m 0 5 m from the vine trunk the sensors were coupled to a em50 data collection system decagon devices pullman wa usa and watermark 200ss irrometer co riverside ca usa so that the data were stored every 30 min overall both volumetric soil moisture and soil water potential were measured in one randomly selected plant per treatment while for prd measurements were taken on both sides of the root system prd 1 side that received the first irrigation shift and prd 2 side that first remained without water 2 3 gas exchange overall the gas exchange measurements and other analyses outlined below were made on one fully expanded well exposed leaf opposite to the first cluster of the first cane in each plant gas exchange parameters were obtained on the 0 15th and 30th dait of the first season summer and on the 15th 30th and 45th dait of the second season spring between 08 00 and 12 00 h light response curves of net photosynthetic rate a net were made using a li cor 6400xt portable photosynthesis system li cor inc lincoln ne usa as described in shapiro et al 2004 and taking into consideration the precautions of pons and welschen 2002 the system incorporated a co2 controller which was used to set the co2 concentration inside the li cor cuvette at 400 μl l 1 the 6 cm2 cuvette was fitted with a red blue light source 6400 02b the net photosynthetic rate anet stomatal conductance gs transpiration rate e and the internal to ambient co2 concentration ratio ci ca all at 1500 μmol m 2 s 1 photosynthetic photon flux density ppfd were determined from the light response curves with 24 levels of ppfd 1500 1200 800 500 200 100 90 80 70 and every 5 ppfd between 70 and 0 μmol m 2 s 1 the rate of respiration in the dark rdark was taken as the value of a net at 0 μmol m 2 s 1 ppfd rate of respiration in the light rlight was estimated using the method originally described in kok 1948 as the y axis intercept of a first order linear regression fitted to anet irradiance plots to measurements made over the 25 65 μmol m 2 s 1 irradiance range all gas exchange data were corrected for the increase in intercellular co2 concentrations c i with decreasing irradiance which can result in reduced rates of photorespiration and increased rates of carboxylation villar et al 1994 the correction was applied by adjusting the rlight through iteration to minimize the intercept of photosynthetic electron transport j as a function of irradiance kirschbaum and farquhar 1987 j was calculated according to farquhar and von caemmerer 1982 1 j 4 a n e t r l i g h t c

were used to calculate the water use efficiency anet e and the intrinsic water use efficiency a net g s in addition leaf carbon balance lcb for the experiment was estimated using the following equation 8 l c b a n e t r d a r k r l i g h t all gas exchange measurements were taken at a relative humidity of approximately 65 75 by manipulating the amount of air passing through a drying column prior to entering the leaf cuvette the li cor cuvette block temperature was set to 30 c for all measurements to account for the influences of leaf temperature on gas exchange variables in addition the flow rate was kept at 300 μmol m 2 s 1 2 4 spad values and chlorophyll a fluorescence spad values and chlorophyll a fluorescence were measured on the same intact leaves used for gas exchange measurements and on the same days between 08 00 and 10 00 h five spad values were averaged in the same sampled leaf using the spad 502 chlorophyll meter minolta co ltd osaka japan maximum quantum

of a leaf covered with liquid paraffin applied below the leaf which avoided transpiration increased leaf temperature while twet is the temperature of a leaf sprayed with fresh water reduced leaf temperature tleaf values that are close to twet will result in high cwsi values which are indicative of intense transpiration when a plant is transpiring fully the leaf temperature is 1 4 below air temperature and the cwsi is close to 1 as the transpiration decreases the leaf temperature rises and can reach to 4 6 above air temperature when the plant is no longer transpiring the cwsi is close to 0 2 6 leaf water potential leaf water potential ψ was measured immediately after leaf excision at pre dawn ψpd and midday ψmd according to schölander et al 1965 using a pressure chamber model 1000 pms instrument co albany or usa the drop of ψmd in relation to ψpd was also calculated ψdrop measurements were performed on leaves adjacent to those used for the analyses previously outlined well exposed fully expanded leaf opposed to the first cluster of the first cane and on the 0 15th and 30th dait of the first season as well as on the 15th 30th and 45th dait of the second season 2 7 c isotope composition δ13c on the 54th dait of the second season tips of shoot ca 0 01 m where leaves used for previous analyses were inserted were dried in an air forced ventilation oven at 70 c for 72 h grounded in a mill grinder willy mssl 031 and a range of c a 2 00 mg weighed out in tin capsules thereafter the carbon 13c 12c isotope ratio of the samples were analyzed in an isoprime isotope ratio mass spectrometer micromass uk coupled to an elemental analyzer eurovector italy the isotopic c ratio was calculated using the following standard δ notation 10 δ 13 c r s a m p l e r r e f e r e n c e 1 1000 where r 13c 12c for carbon the isotope ratios were calibrated against the international standards iaea ch6 and iaea ch7 δ13c results were referenced against peedee belemnite pdb precision the standard deviation of the set of standards analyzed in each batch was 0 06 2 8 fruit quality and yield on the 42nd and 54th dait of the first and second seasons respectively the clusters opposite to the leaves used for the analyses previously outlined were collected to count total berry number cluster length and diameter of clusters using a digital caliper 0 01 mm precision and cluster weight using a digital balance 0 001 g precision anthocyanins index was estimated using the multiplex 2 mx sensor force a orsay france three measurements were averaged per cluster this instrument has four light emitting diode sources in the uv a 370 nm blue 460 nm green 515 nm and red 637 nm spectral regions betemps et al 2012 the excitation light is sequentially pulsed at 476 hz with 20 μs per flash and synchronized with the photodiode detectors to record the fluorescence signals chlorophyll fluorescence both in the red 680 690 nm rf and far red 730 780 nm frf bands was acquired sequentially at all the excitation wavelengths the combination of rf and frf fluorescence signals obtained with the different excitation bands provided the variable tuccio et al 2011 11 anthocyanins anth rg log f r f r e d f r f g r e e n thereafter 10 berries of each cluster were randomly selected for measurement of diameter length and weight the same 10 berries were used to estimate the total soluble solids brix with a refractometer model atago n1 e atago co ltd itabashi ku tokyo japan these same 10 berries were then manually macerated and 5 ml of juice were added to 45 ml of deionized water in order to measure the ph using a digital ph meter model qa400se quimis diadema são paulo brazil total acidity was obtained by titration with naoh as recommended by oiv 1990 and the relation between total soluble solids total titratable acidity was calculated moreover at harvest yield components were assessed following manual harvesting and weighing the production on site cluster number and yield per vine were recorded for all plants on each site 2 9 statistical analysis a randomized block design in a split plot scheme was used with two growth conditions covered and uncovered x three water management x six replicates totaling 36 plots data were subjected to analysis of variance tests and the mean pairwise comparisons made using the tukey hsd test at 5 probability liner regression slopes for the relationship between ψ and vpd was calculated regardless of treatment statistical analysis was made using the software assistat 7 0 beta 3 results during the first season summer the seasonal average air temperature was 27 9 c in both the covered and uncovered sites supplementary fig s1 a both the maximum and average relative humidity were ca 12 higher in the covered site reaching values close to 100 on most days supplementary fig s1 b similarly the average vpd were ca 15 higher in the covered site supplementary fig s1 d the average maximum and minimum ppfd were ca 14 higher in the covered site indicating that during the first season more ppfd was intercepted by the anti bird screen of the uncovered site than by the tpc supplementary fig s1 c climate variables widely varied throughout the second season supplementary fig s2 the thermal amplitude of the uncovered site was higher with lower minimum ca 5 and higher maximum c a 5 air temperatures being recorded throughout the season supplementary fig s2 a on the other hand the highest 96 7 and the lowest 37 2 relative humidity values were observed in the covered site supplementary fig s2 b due to dust accumulation over the tpc ppfd in the covered site was ca 10 lower than the uncovered site during the second season supplementary fig s2 c the highest vpd values observed in the covered and uncovered sites were 6 0 and 5 5 kpa respectively supplementary fig s2 d volumetric soil moisture was maintained at ca 15 in fi plants grown in the covered site and at ca 16 in the uncovered site during the first season supplementary fig s3 the lowest values of soil moisture in rdi plants were 6 7 and 9 1 in covered and uncovered sites respectively supplementary fig s3 the non irrigated side of the prd treatment approached the lowest volumetric soil moisture values at 28 dait in the covered site 5 7 and at 42 dait in the uncovered site 8 7 supplementary fig s3 soil water potential measured during the second season can be observed in supplementary fig s4 in covered rdi and prd non irrigated side plots soil water potential decreased as much as 112 2 and 160 2 kpa respectively while fi plants were maintained at ca 21 kpa supplementary fig s4 a due to the rainfalls during the second season differences in soil water potential among water management treatments were not observed in the uncovered site supplementary fig s4 b since differences in soil water potential among water management treatments were not observed in the uncovered site during the second season spring supplementary fig s4 b only mean values regarding such site and season regardless of water management are noted in most figures and tables presented results regarding spad values chlorophyll a fluorescence parameters cwsi leaf water potential anet e gs ci ca vc1500 and vo1500 measured at 0 and 15 dait on the first season and at 15 and 30 dait during the second season are not shown no significant differences moreover no significant differences were observed between rdi and prd treatments under the experimental conditions niagara rosada grapevines presented an anisohydric behavior in response to increase in the ambient vpd during the day fig 1 in both sites and seasons plants of all water management treatments including fi showed at midday ψmd when air vpd was higher than 2 92 kpa a leaf water potential value that was ca 81 lower than ψpd recorded at air vpd lower than 0 57 kpa table 1 as a consequence a close negative linear relationship between ψ and air vpd occurred fig 1 however no effects of differential water supply and or tpc treatments were observed on either ψpd or ψmd values table 1 furthermore there were no stomatal effects in response to water management treatments and anet e and g s did not significantly change in either seasons table 2 although the covered prd plants presented a non significant tendency to present lower e and gs values than both rdi and fi at 30 and 45 dait of the first and second season respectively table 2 this trend was not observed on the other days data not shown the lowest gs value observed was 0 17 mol h2o m 2 s 1 in the covered prd plants at both seasons table 2 although without significant differences regardless of water management treatments a tendency towards lower gs and e values 22 76 and 14 1 respectively were observed in the covered site throughout the entire experiment whereas anet was slightly higher ca 1 4 table 2 water management treatments did not show significant differences for calculated rates of rubisco carboxylation and oxygenation at 1500 μmol m 2 s 1 vc1500 and vo1500 as well as ci ca and δ13c in both sites table 2 however regardless of water management treatments plants grown in the covered site presented non significant trends throughout both seasons to lower ci ca ca 10 higher vc1500 ca 4 and vo1500 ca 5 as well as slightly less negative δ13c ca 3 than uncovered plants at the end of the second season table 2 when either rdi or prd was used tleaf did not differ from those in the fi treatment table 2 in either the covered or uncovered sites and hence cwsi was not affected table 2 however regardless water management treatments there were non statistical trends towards higher tleaf ca 6 and lower cwsi values ca 11 in covered plants relative to uncovered plants throughout both seasons table 2 no significant differences were found for either season in anet gs and anet e among water management treatments in covered fig 2 a and d fig 3 a and c and uncovered fig 2 b and e sites throughout the experiment regardless of water management treatments there were non statistical trends for higher anet gs ca 12 7 fig 2 c and fig 3 b and anet e ratios ca 14 8 fig 2 f and fig 3 d in covered plants than the uncovered plants throughout both seasons and measurement days spad values were not affected by the tpc or by reducing water supply through either rdi or prd supplementary table s1 similarly photochemical capacity was not influenced by either water management treatments or tpc use and thus significant differences in chlorophyll fluorescence variables were not observed and fv fm values remained higher than 0 81 at the end of each season for all treatments supplementary table s1 reducing water supply through either rdi or prd in both sites as well as using tpc regardless water management treatments did not significantly change rdark rlight and rlight rdark in relation to fi and uncovered conditions respectively throughout both seasons figs 4 and 5 likewise lcb did not significantly vary in response to treatments applied during the entire experiment figs 6 and 7 during the 42 dait of the first season 154 3 and 150 4 l of water were saved per plant in the covered and uncovered sites respectively when either rdi or prd was applied fig 8 a and c likewise during the second season these water management treatments rdi and prd reduced the amount of water applied per plant by 195 4 and 184 5 l in the covered and uncovered sites respectively throughout the 54 dait period fig 8 b and d considering a planting density of 1850 grapevines per hectare 323 38 and 310 31 m3 of water per hectare covered and uncovered sites respectively can be saved each season when either rdi or prd is used from fruit set to harvest of niagara rosada grapevine cultivated under the experimental conditions used in this work the reductions in water applied through the use of either rdi or prd did not affect any of the fruit quality parameters analyzed in either the covered or uncovered sites in either seasons supplementary table s2 moreover there were no negative effects of tpc on fruit quality or yield supplementary table s2 4 discussion 4 1 anisohydric behavior of niagara rosada grapevine grapevines show various strategies known as stress tolerance or avoidance mechanisms so that different cultivars have been classified as either anisohydric or isohydric in response to changes in air vdp and or water availability schultz 2003 soar et al 2006 chaves et al 2010 tomás et al 2014 lavoie lamoureux et al 2017 under the tropical experimental conditions studied niagara rosada grapevine presented anisohydric behavior plants from all water management treatments including fi plants showed reduced ψ as air vpd increased at midday ψmd in both sites resulting in a considerably high ψdrop table 1 and a strong negative linear relationship between ψ and air vpd fig 1 indeed anisohydric plants tend to show variable ψ values in response to increased evaporative demand so that ψmd is substantially lower than ψpd schultz 2003 chaumont and tyerman 2014 despite such anisohydric behavior no effects on ψpd ψmd and ψdrop were observed when either rdi or prd was used in both sites table 1 maintaining similar ψ values regardless of water availability is typically achieved by reducing gs in isohydric plants poni et al 2007 lovisolo et al 2010 pou et al 2012 flexas 2016 lavoie lamoureux et al 2017 aba accumulation in leaves can promote early stomatal closure in response to decreased soil water content and thereby reduce water loss and preserve ψ schultz 2003 pou et al 2012 tombesi et al 2015 however this mechanism was not observed in the present study and neither gs nor e were reduced when deficit irrigation treatments were applied table 2 instead our results indicate that although the soil water content of both rdi and prd decreased considerably in relation to fi supplementary figs s3 and s4 in tpc area ψ did not change table 1 and the resulting water availability was sufficient to maintain the plants internal water status green et al 1997 observed in mature apple trees that previously dehydrated roots responded to irrigation by exhibiting higher sap flow rates than occurs when the entire root zone is watered this increase in root hydraulic conductivity seems to be mediated by aquaporin activity lovisolo and schubert 2006 thus we speculate that factors other than the stomatal control are likely to be involved in the observed response of ψ among water management treatments in the anisohydric niagara rosada grapevine lavoie lamoureux et al 2017 such as up regulation of aquaporin expression vandeleur et al 2009 vitali et al 2016 water redistribution within the plant via lateral flow between vessels in both radial and tangential directions halis et al 2012 and or osmotic adjustment patakas and noitsakis 1999 4 2 water use efficiency and intrinsic water use efficiency in grapevine exposed to deficit irrigation in tropical conditions anisohydric plants show high tolerance to reduced water availability and close their stomata at water potentials well below those of well watered plants soar et al 2006 lavoie lamoureux et al 2017 for this reason anisohydric grapevines can maintain photosynthetic rates at high levels under conditions of low water availability in the soil flexas et al 2006 palliotti et al 2015 in the present work conducted under tropical conditions anet did not change when both rdi and prd were used regardless of site table 2 since both gs and e did not vary among water management treatments no significant differences in anet gs fig 2 a and b fig 3 a or in anet e fig 2 d and e fig 3 c were observed in either site curiously in grapevines rdi and prd are usually associated with a larger reduction in gs and e than in anet resulting in increased anet gs de souza et al 2005 chaves et al 2007 pou et al 2012 hochberg et al 2013 and anet e de souza et al 2005 chaves et al 2007 however this trend was not observed in the present work or in our previous growth chamber study silva et al 2017 in general these effects are not as pronounced in anisohydric as they are in isohydric plants since the stomatal responses of isohydric plants to reduced water availability are typically stronger poni et al 2007 lovisolo et al 2010 pou et al 2012 flexas 2016 lavoie lamoureux et al 2017 our observed responses of both anet gs and anet e corroborate with our δ13c results since significant variation was not observed among water management treatments at the end of the second season in either sites table 2 previous work found that plants grown under reduced water availability had a less negative δ13c when gs was lower de souza et al 2005 chaves et al 2007 and therefore both anet gs and anet e were higher condon et al 2004 an affect not observed in the present work table 2 fig 2 a b d and e fig 3 a and c moreover considering that δ13c integrates photosynthetic activity throughout the period over which the tissue was synthesized salazar parra et al 2015 and reflects the interplay among all aspects of plant carbon and water relations aranjuelo et al 2009 we can assume that neither rdi or prd cause damage to the capacity for co2 assimilation in niagara rosada grapevines grown under tropical conditions 4 3 effects of deficit irrigation on biochemical and photochemical traits of grapevine grown in tropical conditions although a restricted co2 supply is considered an important cause for decreased photosynthetic rates under reduced water availability flexas et al 2006 the amount of carbon assimilated is strongly driven by the leaf biochemical potential flexas et al 2016 in the present work vc1500 as well as vo1500 did not vary among the water management treatments regardless of site or season table 2 by closing stomata later in response to reduced water availability anisohydric plants delay metabolic limitations flexas et al 2006 pou et al 2012 palliotti et al 2015 and maintain the activity of calvin cycle enzymes de souza et al 2005 as observed in the present work through vc1500 and vo1500 values table 2 these results demonstrate that the affinity of rubisco to co2 was not affected by either rdi and prd gago et al 2014 galmés et al 2014 2015 flexas et al 2016 under tropical conditions a desirable feature that matches photoprotection with a positive carbon assimilation hochberg et al 2013 the non variable ci ca values table 2 demonstrates that co2 accumulation in the mesophyll did not occur in either rdi or prd treatments and thus the overall activity of the calvin cycle enzymes was stable regardless of water availability de souza et al 2005 therefore both rdi and prd can be used for niagara rosada grapevine cultivation under the experimental conditions of this work without harming the biochemical potential for photosynthesis leaf photochemistry is co regulated with rubisco content and or activity through feed back or feed forward changes in redox balance homeostasis via photosynthetic control foyer et al 1990 galmés et al 2013 since neither rdi or prd caused biochemical impairments on niagara rosada photosynthesis no damage to chlorophyll biosynthesis or breakdown was observed as indicated by the spad values not being affected by water management treatments supplementary table s1 hence regardless of site no effects of either rdi or prd on pi sm rc cs0 et0 tr et0 abs or di cs0 were shown in both seasons supplementary table s1 moreover the fv fm ratio an important variable which provides a measure of the rate of linear electron transport jamil et al 2007 tang et al 2007 balouchi 2010 was higher than 0 81 at the end of both seasons in all treatments supplementary table s1 thus the psii reaction centers of niagara rosada grapevine show no indication of damage or inactivation zlatev 2009 vaz and sharma 2011 and there was no apparent blockage of electron transfer between the acceptors shu et al 2012 as the result of the applied reduction in water availability in tropical conditions studied indeed metabolic impairment on biochemical and photochemical capacity of photosynthesis has been shown to occur only when stomatal conductance drops below 0 05 0 10 mol h2o m 2 s 1 bota et al 2004 flexas et al 2006 which did not occur in our experiment table 2 considering that climate change will likely enhance the severity of drought ipcc 2014 anisohydric grapevines that do not reduce gs in response to reduced water availability can to avoid biochemical or photochemical damage pou et al 2012 palliotti et al 2015 and thus should be preferentially cultivated in tropical regions 4 4 respiration and leaf carbon balance in grapevines deficit irrigated analyzing all the physiological processes involved in c metabolism can be extremely difficult morales et al 2016 however both photosynthesis and respiration are basic components of plant productivity that should be considered together in grapevines ecophysiological studies schultz and stoll 2010 it has been previously reported that r in grapevines can increase under moderate water shortage silva et al 2017 suggesting that deficit irrigation could result in increased carbon losses flexas et al 2010 salazar parra et al 2015 increased respiratory carbon losses were not observed in the present study and reducing water supply with either rdi or prd did not significantly change rdark or rlight in relation to fi in either seasons figs 4 a b d and e fig 5 a and c indeed leaf respiration can be strongly enhanced by increases in tleaf caused by reduced transpiration when water availability is reduced flexas et al 2010 a condition not observed in the present work regardless of site table 2 instead in the anisohydric niagara rosada grapevines neither gs or e were reduced by deficit irrigation rdi and prd table 2 and tleaf was unaffected by the water management treatments table 2 rlight rdark was not affected by reduced water availability through either rdi or prd treatments in either site figs 4 g and h fig 5 e this response is related to the anisohydric behavior as well in general rlight rdark is directly related to changes in vo so that conditions which increase vo can also increase rlight rdark due to high demand for tca cycle substrates associated with the recovery of photorespiratory cycle intermediates in the peroxisome tcherkez et al 2008 griffin and turnbul 2013 since anisohydric plants delay metabolic limitations by closing the stomata later in response to reduced water availability flexas et al 2006 pou et al 2012 both rdi and prd did not cause significant effects on vo1500 table 2 and thereby no effects on rlight rdark were observed during either season in both sites figs 4 g and h fig 5 e in order to analyze the effectiveness of deficit irrigation use in grapevines grown in a given region the lcb must be assessed the potential limitations imposed by reduced water availability are primarily dependent on the balance between photosynthesis and respiration flexas et al 2006 in the present work regardless of site the lcb did not vary significantly in response to either rdi or prd in relation to fi throughout the entire experiment fig 6 a and b fig 7 a again this response was caused by the anisohydric behavior of niagara rosada which resulted in unchanged rates of anet table 2 rlight and rdark figs 4 a b d and e fig 5 a and c since lcb is directly proportional to carbon available for plant s growth and yield flexas et al 2006 escalona et al 2012 ayub et al 2014 we can assume that the use of deficit irrigation techniques in anisohydric grapevines such as niagara rosada will not result in a substantial reduction in carbon gain under tropical climates 4 5 effects of deficit irrigation on grapevine s fruit quality and yield in tropical conditions the use of rdi or prd in tropically grown grapevines saved a considerable amount of water both with and without tpc fig 8 our trials suggest that more than 310 m3 of water can be saved per hectare each season when either rdi or prd is applied from fruit set to harvest of niagara rosada importantly the reduced water supply had no negative effects on niagara rosada s yield or fruit quality if the water management treatments are started after fruit set supplementary table s2 at this developmental stage the berry s connectivity to the vine is via the phloem thomas et al 2006 tarara and peña 2015 and any reduction in berry size or quality would be indirectly related to decreases in photosynthesis wang et al 2003 however negative effects on photosynthesis were not observed in the present work and both anet and vc1500 values remained unchanged table 2 similarly photochemical capacity was not affected by either rdi or prd treatments supplementary table s1 as a result it should not be surprising that yield and fruit quality were unaffected supplementary table s2 moreover reductions in yield and changes in fruit quality are commonly associated with increased aba synthesis under deficit irrigation deluc et al 2009 chaves et al 2010 aba limits cell division and consequently grapevines produce small berries and have reduced yields chaves et al 2010 an increase of aba in the leaves of table grapes has also been associated with the accumulation of leaf hexose deluc et al 2009 as a means of controlling sugar transport to grape berries lecourieux et al 2010 finally aba has also been associated with the regulation of anthocyanin synthesis and accumulation in the skin of the fruit peppi et al 2006 lund et al 2008 deluc et al 2009 chaves et al 2010 however the anisohydric behavior of niagara rosada grapevine limited aba synthesis and accumulation poni et al 2007 lovisolo et al 2010 pou et al 2012 flexas 2016 lavoie lamoureux et al 2017 as indicated by the stable gs values among the various water management treatments in our trials table 2 therefore regardless of site there were no effects of either prd or rdi on yield and quality parameters of niagara rosada grapevine under tropical conditions supplementary table s2 no differences were found between rdi and prd treatments for any of traits analyzed in the present work suggesting that both water management techniques can be useful alternatives to save water in grapevines cultivated in tropical conditions particularly for anisohydric cultivars however as previously reported dos santos et al 2003 gu et al 2004 intrigliolo and castel 2009 collins et al 2010 the total cost of the irrigation system and not just the method of application should be considered since prd requires twice the amount of tubing as rdi it incurs higher installation and maintenance costs permanhani et al 2016 and thus rdi may economically preferred 4 6 use of transparent plastic covering tpc regardless of water management treatments plants grown in the covered site trended towards higher anet gs fig 2 c and fig 3 b and anet e fig 2 f and fig 3 d during both seasons as a result of having lower gs and e values respectively table 2 tpc is known to effect both anet e and anet gs in table grapes permanhani et al 2016 by altering the microclimate deluc et al 2009 roberto et al 2011 and increasing leaf surface temperatures liu et al 2012 in the present work despite significant within and between season variation in climatic conditions supplementary figs s1 and s2 there was a consistent tendency for covered plants to have slightly higher tleaf table 2 and lower cwsi c a 11 2 table 2 cwsi is typically related to stomatal regulation and thus can affect plant energy balance grant et al 2007 vaz et al 2016 in our experiments gs and e were both reduced table 2 leading to a positive effect of tpc on anet gs fig 2 c and fig 3 b and on anet e fig 2 f and fig 3 d concomitantly discrimination against 13c was reduced and less negative δ13c values were observed in covered plants at the end of the second season in response to reduced gs table 2 such negative δ13c values are typically associated with higher water use efficiency condon et al 2004 a typical trend observed throughout the entire experiment in the covered site table 2 fig 2 c and f fig 3 b and d covered plants tended towards lower ci ca ratios table 2 indicating stomatal limitation of photosynthesis the slightly reduced gs of covered plants table 2 was compensated by higher rubisco carboxylation rates in plants from the covered site represented by vc1500 values table 2 rubisco kinetics and maximum activity are directly affected by leaf temperature gago et al 2014 galmés et al 2014 2015 flexas et al 2016 and the higher tleaf of the covered plants table 2 increased both vc1500 and vo1500 table 2 it is important to consider that although photorespiration can diminish the potential photosynthetic activity of plants salazar parra et al 2015 the simultaneous increase of photorespiration and photosynthesis as observed in the present work in covered plants table 2 provides an avoidance mechanism against photoinhibition maintaining a positive carbon balance hochberg et al 2013 indeed photosynthetic activity was positively rather than negatively affected by the tpc and slightly higher anet values were observed in plants grown under the covering table 2 the use of tpc to cultivate niagara rosada grapevine in a tropical area had no negative effects on photochemical capacity supplementary table s1 or on leaf respiration rates fig 4 c f and i fig 5 b d and f and lcb fig 6 c fig 7 b furthermore fruit quality and yield were maintained during both seasons supplementary table s2 although excessive rainfall can damage grape production in this region particularly during summer this did not occur over the duration of our experiments however tpc can minimize negative effects of heavy rains on fruit quality monteiro and lopes 2007 chaves et al 2010 and reduce fungicide use by preventing the development disease trigged by leaf wetness such as mildew and botrytis botelho et al 2011 pedro et al 2011 in the present work the plants grown in uncovered area received 3 times more pesticides than the tpc plants data not showed therefore the use of tpc can be a beneficial strategy for niagara rosada grapevines grown in wet tropical regions clearly further studies focused on phytosanitary and its economic impacts are needed to give more details about the effectiveness of tpc use in tropical areas 5 conclusions our work growing niagara rosada grapevine in tropical conditions demonstrates that i although the grapevine presents an anisohydric behavior ii deficit irrigation treatments do not affect ψ although leaf water potential was affected by air vpd iii neither rdi nor prd had significant effects on either anet gs or anet e in anisohydric grapevine iv by not closing stomata in response to reduced water availability limitations on both carboxylation reactions of photosynthesis and rubisco oxygenation rates are not observed and the photochemical capacity is not inhibited v leaf respiration rates are not affected by either rdi of prd since deficit irrigation in anisohydric grapevine does not limit vo1500 rlight rdark is not changed the use of either rdi or prd does not reduce carbon gain and lcb is not affected vi considerable amounts of water are saved when either rdi or prd is used from fruit set to harvest without affecting yield and fruit quality rdi is the preferable treatment method for practical reasons vii the use of tpc can be an effective strategy for growing niagara rosada grapevines in wet tropical areas since it avoids the negative effects of heavy rains on fruit quality and limits the development of disease caused by leaf wetness while showing the potential to improve anet e anet gs and vc1500

11506,an increase in olive oil consumption has occurred worldwide in the last decades and has resulted in more land area being dedicated to olive orchards in several southern hemisphere countries in order to achieve sustainable productivity under the increasing water scarcity optimal water use is essential thus a field experiment was conducted during four consecutive growing seasons 2010 2011 to 2013 2014 to evaluate olive oil quality in response to irrigation cut off strategies applied after fruit set using midday stem water potential ψstem thresholds in a super high density olive orchard cv arbequina located in the pencahue valley maule region chile the experimental design was completely randomized with four treatments and four replicates in treatment t1 control ψstem was between 1 4 and 2 2 mpa 100 of actual evapotranspiration throughout the season while the t2 t3 and t4 treatments did not receive irrigation from fruit set until they reached a ψstem threshold of approximately 3 5 5 0 and 6 0 mpa respectively once these thresholds were reached irrigation was reestablished and maintained as t1 in all treatments until olives were harvested fruit oil and water content at harvest were not affected by the different treatments free acidity was also not affected while peroxide and extinction coefficients only showed minor differences between treatments that were within the limits established for commercial extra virgin oil quality total polyphenols at harvest were much higher in the water deficit treatments and showed a significant linear relationship each year with the water stress integral the percentages of the main fatty acids were not affected by the treatments however they were significantly different between seasons sensory tests indicated that the higher total polyphenol content positively contributed to more pronounced bitter and pungent attributes of olive oil from trees with higher water deficit thus the irrigation cut off strategies evaluated at our four year study can be an excellent management tool to both improve the oil quality of cv arbequina and reduce water use in super high density orchard keywords arbequina deficit irrigation fatty acid composition olea europaea plant water status sensory analysis 1 introduction in recent years the consumption of olive oil has increased worldwide even in countries that do not have a long standing tradition of olive growing morello et al 2006 this is due in part to olive oil being linked to lower incidences of cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases type 2 diabetes and even cancer guasch ferre et al 2015 mateos et al 2013 pérez jiménez et al 2007 in order to meet the new demand for olive oil new plantations have been established in many parts of the world including south american countries such as chile and argentina garcía gonzález et al 2010 rondanini et al 2011 irrigation application is common in these new orchards which are increasingly being planted in higher densities 1000 trees ha 1 and trained as hedgerows to allow for a more efficient use of mechanical harvesters fernandes silva et al 2013 gómez del campo 2013a 2013b under this scenario the cultivar that best adapts to mechanical harvesting is arbequina due to its small size precocity and branch flexibility gómez del campo 2013b torres and maestri 2006 the application of irrigation water has become common in olive orchards because several studies have proven the benefits of water supply on olive yield lodolini et al 2014 martín vertedor et al 2011 moriana et al 2003 patumi et al 1999 2002 tognetti et al 2007 however the increasing water scarcity globally and the increased water demand for other uses in our society has caused pressure to reduce the water used in irrigation fereres and soriano 2007 for this reason regulated deficit irrigation rdi has been suggested for optimizing water application in super high density olive orchards fernández et al 2013 gómez del campo 2013a 2013b in this regard cutting off irrigation until reaching a predetermined water potential threshold can be used as a management tool to save water without affecting fruit and oil yields dell amico et al 2012 trentacoste et al 2015 irrigation does not often affect the oil concentration in the fruit on a dry weight basis therefore the oil yield is mostly affected by rdi strategies when fruit number and subsequent yield are reduced garcía et al 2013 gómez rico et al 2007 iniesta et al 2009 patumi et al 2002 based on this information rdi strategies may have an advantageous effect since water use efficiency for olive oil production increases iniesta et al 2009 moreover trees grown under rdi strategies often have similar or even better olive oil quality compared to trees that are well irrigated fernandes silva et al 2013 garcía et al 2013 found that irrigation strategies do not significantly affect parameters of oil quality such as free acidity peroxide value and extinction coefficients k232 k270 moreover motilva et al 2000 observed that the application of rdi strategies applied to cv arbequina induced a significant increase in polyphenol concentration and oil stability fernandes silva et al 2013 also observed that total polyphenols were strongly related to the water stress integral furthermore gómez del campo and garcía 2013 observed that the application of rdi in summer caused a significantly higher oxidative stability which coincided with a significantly higher content of phenol derivatives these compounds are of great interest because they influence the quality and the palatability of olive oils and increase their shelf life by slowing the formation of polyunsaturated fatty acid hydroperoxides abaza et al 2005 moreover olive oil fatty acid composition is often not affected by rdi strategies motilva et al 2000 although other studies indicate that irrigation strategies cause small variations in the oleic and palmitic acids dabbou et al 2010 fernandes silva et al 2013 genotype i e cultivar and environmental conditions appear to have a stronger effect on the oil s fatty acid composition especially for palmitic and oleic acids borges et al 2017 rondanini et al 2011 among the environmental factors temperature can play an essential role in fatty acid composition hernández et al 2011 in this context garcía inza et al 2014 indicated that high temperatures increase polyunsaturated fatty acid content linoleic and linolenic acids deficit irrigation can also influence the sensory attributes of olive oil in cultivars such as arbequina which normally has low phenolic concentrations deficit irrigation is beneficial due to the greater polyphenol concentrations more phenolics contribute to better balanced oils with a more sophisticated pungent and bitter flavor fernandes silva et al 2013 deficit irrigation can also reduce hay like and greasy defects in olive oils dabbou et al 2010 in the literature it has been reported that irrigation cut off strategies in olive trees cv morisca have caused decreased shoot growth using a ψstem threshold value of 2 0 mpa moriana et al 2012 also this strategy with a ψstem threshold value of 2 5 mpa increased water productivity twofold with respect to the control ψstem around 1 2 mpa however oil yield may not necessarily be reduced with such strategies while moriana et al 2012 observed that oil yield cv morisca decreased using a ψstem threshold of 2 0 mpa trentacoste et al 2015 indicated that oil yield cv frantoio was not significantly affected using a ψstem threshold of 2 5 mpa finally ahumada orellana et al 2017 indicated that oil yield cv arbequina was also not reduced when irrigation was cut off from fruit set until reaching a ψstem threshold 3 5 mpa but it was significantly decreased with ψstem thresholds 5 0 mpa despite these assessments of oil yield there is little information about the effect of irrigation cut off on the olive oil quality for this reason the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of irrigation cut off strategies on quality attributes of monovarietal extra virgin olive oil from cv arbequina 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experimental design the site description and experimental design are described in detail by ahumada orellana et al 2017 who evaluated the yield and water productivity responses to irrigation cut off strategies applied after fruit set using ψstem thresholds in a super high density olive orchard briefly an experiment was conducted during four consecutive growing seasons 2010 2011 to 2013 2014 in a 6 year old drip irrigated olive orchard olea europaea l cv arbequina located in the pencahue valley maule region chile 35 232 l s 71 442 w 96 m altitude the olive trees were trained under a hedgerow system with a planting density of 1333 tree ha 1 1 5 5 0 m and irrigation was performed using two 2 0 l h 1 drippers per tree using good quality water pumped from a nearby river at the experimental site the climate is mediterranean with rainfall occurring mostly during the winter months and the soil has a clay loam texture with a field capacity and wilting point of 31 and 16 cm3 cm 3 respectively the olive water requirements were calculated according to the standard fao56 approach for crop evapotranspiration etc eto kc where eto is the reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 and kc is the crop coefficient climate data for calculating eto were collected from an automated weather station installed over a reference grass and located about 2 km from the experimental site values of eto were estimated using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 ortega farías et al 1995 while those of kc were between 0 56 and 0 42 see lópez olivari et al 2016 the experimental design was completely randomized with four treatments t1 t2 t3 and t4 and four replications five trees per replication t1 was irrigated with 100 of etc during the growing season from september to april for t2 t3 and t4 the irrigation was cut off from fruit set about 20 days after full bloom until reaching ψstem thresholds of approximately 3 5 5 0 and 6 0 mpa respectively upon reaching these thresholds the irrigation was restored and maintained as t1 in all treatments until olives were harvested it is important to indicate that the period after fruit set always coincides with high atmospheric demands for water vapor and pit hardening which is the least sensitive to water deficit goldhamer 1999 gómez del campo and garcía 2013 2 2 plant water status measurements the midday stem water potential ψstem was measured weekly to monitor plant water status these measurements were performed between 12 30 and 14 00 h gómez del campo et al 2008 moriana and fereres 2002 using two apical twigs per plot from the current year with at least 10 leaves located in the middle of the canopy rousseaux et al 2008 secchi et al 2007 these twigs were covered in the canopy with a plastic bag and aluminum foil for 1 2 h before the measurements meyer and reicosky 1985 thereafter the twigs were removed from the tree for measurement using a scholander type pressure chamber pms instrument company model 1000 pressure chamber instrument scholander et al 1965 lastly in order to describe the accumulated effect of the irrigation cut off strategies the water stress integral sψ was calculated myers 1988 as 1 s ψ ψ s t e m c n where ψstem is the average of stem water potential for any interval mpa c is the value of the maximum stem water potential during the season and n is the number of the days in each interval ahumada orellana et al 2017 moriana et al 2007 2 3 fruit maturity index water content and oil content at harvest fruit were handpicked from each tree using small rakes fruit were harvested manually on 130 131 134 and 127 doy in 2011 2012 2013 and 2014 respectively fruit were separated from leaves and a sample was taken per plot 25 30 kg per treatment in the laboratory the water content of the olive paste was determined by desiccation and oil content by soxhlet extraction which was expressed as a percentage of fresh olive paste weight martín vertedor et al 2011 moreover a sample of 100 olives from each plot was used for calculating the fruit maturity index mi the 100 olives were distributed in eight groups according to the color of their skin and pulp group 0 bright green skin group 1 green yellowish skin group 2 green skin with reddish spots group 3 reddish brown skin group 4 black skin with white pulp group 5 black skin with 50 purple pulp group 6 black skin with 50 purple pulp and group 7 black skin and purple pulp finally mi was calculated as garcia and yousfi 2005 2 m i i n i 100 where i is the group number and ni the number of olives in each group 2 4 oil quality free acidity was determined as the percentage of oleic acid peroxide value pv was expressed as milliequivalents of active oxygen per kilogram of oil meq o2 kg extinction coefficients k232 k270 δk were measured in a spectrophotometer at wavelengths of 232 266 270 and 274 nm frías ruiz et al 2001 total polyphenols were determined by a colorimetric method using the folin ciocalteu reagent by spectrophotometry at 725 nm the result was expressed as ppm of caffeic acid tsimidou 1998 the oil fatty acid composition was determined by gas chromatography frías ruiz et al 2001 in this study the main oil fatty acids were palmitic acid palmitoleic acid stearic acid oleic acid linoleic acid and linolenic acid moreover the following variables were calculated based on the fatty acid composition 3 saturated fatty acid safa palmitic acid stearic acid 4 unsaturated fatty acid unfa palmitoleic acid oleic acid linoleic acid linolenic acid 5 monounsaturated fatty acid mufa palmitoleic acid oleic acid 6 polyunsaturated fatty acid pufa linoleic acid linolenic acid 2 5 sensory analysis sensory analysis of olive oil from each of the treatments was evaluated by quantitative descriptive analysis qda which was carried out by five evaluators the samples were provided in blue glass tumblers covered with another glass at room temperature approximately 20 c each evaluator classified the following terms olive fruit apple other fruits such as almonds and nuts bitter pungent sweet and cut grass on a numerical scale from 0 5 with 0 being imperceptible and 5 being an extreme perception of the intensity 2 6 statistical analysis treatment effects were evaluated by analysis of variance anova using the statistical software infostat universidad nacional de córdoba argentina the significant differences among the treatments were assessed using tukey s multiple range test p 0 05 a regression analysis was performed to determine the relationship between water stress integral and total polyphenols 3 results 3 1 environmental conditions the accumulated effective rainfall ranged beetwen 12 6 and 84 9 mm with maximum and minimum values observed during 2010 2011 and 2011 2012 growing seasons respectively both daily eto and daily average temperature showed a similar pattern with maximum values occurring during december and january for this southern hemisphere location fig 1 cumulative eto ranged between 986 and 1099 mm while daily average temperatures were between 15 5 and 18 3 c for the four growing season furthermore during the latter period of oil accumulation i e the 40 days before harvest the lowest and highest values of daily maximum temperature were observed during the 2010 11 and 2012 13 seasons respectively table 1 under these climatic conditions the net irrigation amount for t1 was between 183 and 268 mm season 1 fig 2 for the four seasons the water application for the t2 t3 and t4 treatments ranged between 75 and 83 62 76 and 56 70 of t1 respectively 3 2 plant water status the plant water status was described in detail by ahumada orellana et al 2017 the water status of each treatment is briefly described below the plant water status was similar for all treatments between the start of the irrigation season october and fruit set i e the start of water restriction in treatment t1 ψstem values oscillated between 1 3 and 2 2 mpa throughout the first season of study whereas in the other three seasons some lower values i e a minimum of 2 8 mpa did occur late in the summer when eto was high the treatments with irrigation cut off strategies t2 t3 and t4 decreased their ψstem progressively from the start of water restriction at fruit set until their predetermined threshold value was reached the t2 treatment reached its minimum value 3 5 mpa during pit hardening after about 35 days without irrigation the t3 treatment reached its minimum ψstem 5 0 mpa 49 53 days after irrigation cut off except for the 2012 13 season where it was 71 days the t4 treatment reached the ψstem threshold of around 6 0 mpa after 67 78 days without irrigation for most seasons but in the 2012 13 growing season it reached a minimum ψstem of only 5 2 mpa after 97 days once these minimum values were reached the irrigation was restored in the t2 t3 and t4 treatments and their ψstem returned to values similar to those of the t1 treatment at harvest the average water stress integral sψ for the t1 through t4 treatments was 100 1 125 2 210 1 and 255 4 mpa day 1 respectively 3 3 fruit maturity index water content and oil content the average maturity index mi of the treatments at harvest in the four seasons was between 1 42 and 1 56 but there were no significant differences among them table 2 moreover there were no significant differences among treatments for either fruit water content or oil content on a fresh weight basis at harvest which had values between 57 and 68 and 20 21 respectively oil content on a dry weight basis also did not show differences among treatments nevertheless there were significant differences among seasons in mi as well as fruit water and oil content in 2013 14 the mi 1 11 was lower than in the other seasons while oil content was statistically lower in both the 2013 14 and 2010 11 seasons than that observed in the 2011 12 season 3 4 oil quality for the four seasons the values of free acidity peroxide and extinction coefficients k232 k270 and δk were within the limits established for commercial extra virgin olive oil quality values of free acidity for the different irrigation treatments ranged between 0 21 and 0 32 with no significant differences among them table 3 the peroxide values presented significant differences among treatments being lower in treatments that had experienced a higher water deficit however the difference was only significant between the t1 and t3 treatments there were also significant differences among treatments for k232 and k270 extinction coefficients where the higher values were found in treatments with higher water deficit t3 and t4 in contrast the values of δk were more negative in the t3 and t4 treatments compared with t1 total polyphenols were higher in the water deficit treatments compared with t1 also total polyphenols of treatment t3 were significantly higher than t2 moreover total polyphenols showed a high linear correlation with sψ which explained the higher content of total polyphenols in treatments with water deficit in each season furthermore this relationship was strongly influenced by season fig 3 polyphenols showed high values at harvest in the 2011 12 and 2013 14 seasons but were much lower in 2012 13 table 3 in contrast the 2012 13 season showed the highest values of free acidity peroxide and δk compared to the other seasons as shown in table 4 there were no significant effects of irrigation cut off on most of the olive oil fatty acids such as palmitic oleic linoleic and linolenic acid however stearic acid was significantly higher in t3 and t4 while palmitoleic acid was significantly higher in the t2 treatment compared with t4 also there was a significant effect of season on the fatty acid composition in the 2010 11 season the samples presented the lowest level of palmitic acid while samples from the 2013 14 season presented the highest oleic acid and the lowest linoleic acid the ratios of unsa safa and mufa pufa were not significantly affected by the irrigation cut off treatments table 5 values of unfa safa and mufa pufa had a narrow range between 5 66 5 82 and 10 94 11 05 respectively however there were significant differences among seasons with maximum values observed in the 2013 14 season 3 5 sensory analysis the sensory profiles of the olive oils from the four seasons are shown in fig 4 the bitter and pungent attributes were more pronounced in olive oils from trees with higher water deficit t3 and t4 compared with non stressed trees t1 in all seasons moreover olive oil samples from the 2011 12 season showed the highest presence of fruity bitter and pungent attributes compared with other seasons none of the olive oils presented defects in the organoleptic evaluations 4 discussion our chilean study site has a mediterranean type climate with rainfall principally occurring during the winter and a summer that is usually dry and hot ortega farías and lópez olivari 2012 during the four seasons in which this study was conducted the meteorological conditions were as expected with maximum atmospheric demand during the summer however some differences in temperature between seasons were observed during the latter part of the oil accumulation period the results suggest that the irrigation cut off strategies implemented after fruit set did not affect olive ripening this was also observed by gómez del campo and garcía 2013 who indicated that water deficit in the summer did not affect the maturity index in a super high density olive orchard cv arbequina in spain the fruit oil and water contents in our study were also not affected by the irrigation cut off strategies these same variables were previously found to not be greatly affected by water deficit treatments that reached a ψstem of around 4 0 mpa in summer gómez rico et al 2007 iniesta et al 2009 the lack of change in oil content in the t2 and t3 treatments is likely a function of water stress mostly occurring during the pit hardening period rather than afterwards when most oil accumulation occurs however even the longer t4 treatment did not lead to reduced oil content additionally the fruit oil and water contents were similar to those found in other cv arbequina olive orchards from other regions with a mediterranean climate diez et al 2016 garcía et al 2013 grattan et al 2006 iniesta et al 2009 patumi et al 2002 in terms of olive oil quality parameters free acidity was not affected by the irrigation cut off strategies which is consistent with several previous studies of water deficit in olive trees garcía et al 2013 gómez del campo 2013b patumi et al 2002 peroxide values showed a tendency to decrease with water deficit coinciding with tovar et al 2002 in contrast many studies have reported no relationship between irrigation and peroxide values garcía et al 2013 gómez del campo and garcía 2013 patumi et al 2002 lastly dag et al 2008 observed that while peroxide content in the oil was not affected by irrigation other factors such as mechanical harvesting which is common in super high density olive orchards can affect peroxide content mechanically harvested fruit was more prone to injury than hand picked fruit in that study and this led to increased oxidation and hence peroxide values in the case of the extinction coefficients k232 and k270 higher values were obtained in the oils of the more severe water deficit treatments t3 t4 which is in accordance with the results obtained by ramos and santos 2010 in oils from cv cordovil despite these differences between treatments for some parameters the oils were within the limits established by the european regulation ec 1989 03 for all treatments allowing them to be classified as extra virgin oil quality total polyphenols of the olive oils were higher in the treatments associated with greater water deficit intensity as observed in other olive studies fernandes silva et al 2013 gómez rico et al 2007 lodolini et al 2014 motilva et al 2000 patumi et al 2002 tovar et al 2002 water stress as well as other abiotic stresses such as excessive light are generally well known to produce a greater synthesis of phenolic compounds in the fruit and leaves of many plant species reviewed by cheynier et al 2013 additionally linear relationships between total polyphenols and sψ were found in all four seasons fig 3 which coincides with the results of moriana et al 2007 these results are very important because total polyphenols are also closely related to the oxidative stability of olive oil fernandes silva et al 2013 therefore oil with a high polyphenol content will have a longer shelf life in relation to olive oil fatty acid composition irrigation cut off strategies did not affect the main fatty acids palmitic oleic and linoleic these results coincide with motilva et al 2000 who observed that water deficit did not affect oil fatty acid composition in cv arbequina in a fairly similar manner berenguer et al 2006 did not find differences in fatty acids in cv arbequina except for a very minor increase in oleic acid due to severe water deficit in one of two seasons additionally salas et al 1997 only observed differences in fatty acid composition between rain fed and irrigated olive orchards but differences between irrigation treatments were insignificant it is worth noting that the values of oleic acid content for cv arbequina found at our chilean study site were high about 75 and that high oleic acid is a positive attribute in olive oils for human health covas et al 2006 such values are not uncommon in mediterranean climates in europe borges et al 2017 gómez del campo and garcía 2013 but they are much higher than values about 50 reported for more continental sites in argentina where the climate is warmer rondanini et al 2014 2011 this is reaffirmed by morello et al 2006 who point out that the climatology may be more important in some cases than genetic factors in determining the chemical components that characterize olive oil quality among the environmental factors temperature plays a relevant role in the composition of acids through regulating fatty acid desaturases hernández et al 2011 environmental factors likely led to the statistically significant differences between seasons for fatty acid composition in our study although the changes in the percentages of the individual fatty acids were not large similarly other studies have also found differences in olive oil fatty acid composition between seasons fernandes silva et al 2013 tovar et al 2002 in our study the lowest concentrations of stearic and palmitic acids were found in the 2010 11 season and the highest concentrations in the 2013 14 season this result may be explained by borges et al 2017 who indicated that saturated fatty acids were closely influenced by maximum temperature in our study the 2010 11 season had the lowest maximum temperature while the 2013 14 season had the highest maximum temperature additionally the olive oils from the 2011 12 and 2012 13 seasons had the highest concentration of palmitoleic and linolenic acids which could be related to the temperature regime over the course of these seasons including high mean temperatures during the last period of oil accumulation garcía inza et al 2014 has previously reported that these fatty acids increase with temperature in manipulative heating experiments in cv arauco however it is somewhat counterintuitive based on many previous studies in cv arbequina e g mailer et al 2010 rondanini et al 2014 2011 that the statistically highest oleic acid a monounsaturated fatty acid was found in the 2013 14 season when temperature was maximum this is likely related to the low maturity index at harvest in 2013 14 compared to other seasons since oleic acid typically decreases in cv arbequina towards the end of the season as maturity index increases rondanini et al 2014 the sensory analysis showed that the bitter and pungent attributes were more pronounced in olive oils from trees with higher water deficit these results coincide with fernandes silva et al 2013 who indicated that these attributes are more pronounced in oils from trees with water stress because they have a strong relationship with polyphenol concentration these findings are very important because oil from cv arbequina is normally characterized as having a very light pungency and bitterness which often leads to its oil being blended with oils of other cultivars dabbou et al 2010 since irrigation cut off strategies produce a desirable increase in the intensity of these two attributes this could favor its consumption as a monovarietal oil 5 conclusion in summary our results indicate that the evaluated irrigation cut off strategies including those that reached values of 6 0 mpa do not affect the fruit oil content some parameters of oil quality peroxides and extinction coefficients showed minor differences between irrigation treatments however all treatments were within the limits established for the commercial extra virgin quality additionally main fatty acid compositions palmitic oleic linoleic and linolenic acids were not affected by irrigation cut off strategies although fatty acid composition was somewhat influenced by the climatic conditions of each season most interestingly our results over four seasons consistently showed that higher water deficit produced a greater polyphenol content which should increase the oil shelf life moreover greater polyphenols improved the organoleptic quality of the oil which could favor the consumption of monovarietal cv arbequina olive oil for these reasons the more severe irrigation cut offs t3 and t4 improved the oil quality of cv arbequina and reduce water use by 30 40 at our chilean site although some reduction in oil yield is likely with such water deficits based on previous observations ahumada orellana et al 2017 acknowledgements this study

11506,an increase in olive oil consumption has occurred worldwide in the last decades and has resulted in more land area being dedicated to olive orchards in several southern hemisphere countries in order to achieve sustainable productivity under the increasing water scarcity optimal water use is essential thus a field experiment was conducted during four consecutive growing seasons 2010 2011 to 2013 2014 to evaluate olive oil quality in response to irrigation cut off strategies applied after fruit set using midday stem water potential ψstem thresholds in a super high density olive orchard cv arbequina located in the pencahue valley maule region chile the experimental design was completely randomized with four treatments and four replicates in treatment t1 control ψstem was between 1 4 and 2 2 mpa 100 of actual evapotranspiration throughout the season while the t2 t3 and t4 treatments did not receive irrigation from fruit set until they reached a ψstem threshold of approximately 3 5 5 0 and 6 0 mpa respectively once these thresholds were reached irrigation was reestablished and maintained as t1 in all treatments until olives were harvested fruit oil and water content at harvest were not affected by the different treatments free acidity was also not affected while peroxide and extinction coefficients only showed minor differences between treatments that were within the limits established for commercial extra virgin oil quality total polyphenols at harvest were much higher in the water deficit treatments and showed a significant linear relationship each year with the water stress integral the percentages of the main fatty acids were not affected by the treatments however they were significantly different between seasons sensory tests indicated that the higher total polyphenol content positively contributed to more pronounced bitter and pungent attributes of olive oil from trees with higher water deficit thus the irrigation cut off strategies evaluated at our four year study can be an excellent management tool to both improve the oil quality of cv arbequina and reduce water use in super high density orchard keywords arbequina deficit irrigation fatty acid composition olea europaea plant water status sensory analysis 1 introduction in recent years the consumption of olive oil has increased worldwide even in countries that do not have a long standing tradition of olive growing morello et al 2006 this is due in part to olive oil being linked to lower incidences of cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases type 2 diabetes and even cancer guasch ferre et al 2015 mateos et al 2013 pérez jiménez et al 2007 in order to meet the new demand for olive oil new plantations have been established in many parts of the world including south american countries such as chile and argentina garcía gonzález et al 2010 rondanini et al 2011 irrigation application is common in these new orchards which are increasingly being planted in higher densities 1000 trees ha 1 and trained as hedgerows to allow for a more efficient use of mechanical harvesters fernandes silva et al 2013 gómez del campo 2013a 2013b under this scenario the cultivar that best adapts to mechanical harvesting is arbequina due to its small size precocity and branch flexibility gómez del campo 2013b torres and maestri 2006 the application of irrigation water has become common in olive orchards because several studies have proven the benefits of water supply on olive yield lodolini et al 2014 martín vertedor et al 2011 moriana et al 2003 patumi et al 1999 2002 tognetti et al 2007 however the increasing water scarcity globally and the increased water demand for other uses in our society has caused pressure to reduce the water used in irrigation fereres and soriano 2007 for this reason regulated deficit irrigation rdi has been suggested for optimizing water application in super high density olive orchards fernández et al 2013 gómez del campo 2013a 2013b in this regard cutting off irrigation until reaching a predetermined water potential threshold can be used as a management tool to save water without affecting fruit and oil yields dell amico et al 2012 trentacoste et al 2015 irrigation does not often affect the oil concentration in the fruit on a dry weight basis therefore the oil yield is mostly affected by rdi strategies when fruit number and subsequent yield are reduced garcía et al 2013 gómez rico et al 2007 iniesta et al 2009 patumi et al 2002 based on this information rdi strategies may have an advantageous effect since water use efficiency for olive oil production increases iniesta et al 2009 moreover trees grown under rdi strategies often have similar or even better olive oil quality compared to trees that are well irrigated fernandes silva et al 2013 garcía et al 2013 found that irrigation strategies do not significantly affect parameters of oil quality such as free acidity peroxide value and extinction coefficients k232 k270 moreover motilva et al 2000 observed that the application of rdi strategies applied to cv arbequina induced a significant increase in polyphenol concentration and oil stability fernandes silva et al 2013 also observed that total polyphenols were strongly related to the water stress integral furthermore gómez del campo and garcía 2013 observed that the application of rdi in summer caused a significantly higher oxidative stability which coincided with a significantly higher content of phenol derivatives these compounds are of great interest because they influence the quality and the palatability of olive oils and increase their shelf life by slowing the formation of polyunsaturated fatty acid hydroperoxides abaza et al 2005 moreover olive oil fatty acid composition is often not affected by rdi strategies motilva et al 2000 although other studies indicate that irrigation strategies cause small variations in the oleic and palmitic acids dabbou et al 2010 fernandes silva et al 2013 genotype i e cultivar and environmental conditions appear to have a stronger effect on the oil s fatty acid composition especially for palmitic and oleic acids borges et al 2017 rondanini et al 2011 among the environmental factors temperature can play an essential role in fatty acid composition hernández et al 2011 in this context garcía inza et al 2014 indicated that high temperatures increase polyunsaturated fatty acid content linoleic and linolenic acids deficit irrigation can also influence the sensory attributes of olive oil in cultivars such as arbequina which normally has low phenolic concentrations deficit irrigation is beneficial due to the greater polyphenol concentrations more phenolics contribute to better balanced oils with a more sophisticated pungent and bitter flavor fernandes silva et al 2013 deficit irrigation can also reduce hay like and greasy defects in olive oils dabbou et al 2010 in the literature it has been reported that irrigation cut off strategies in olive trees cv morisca have caused decreased shoot growth using a ψstem threshold value of 2 0 mpa moriana et al 2012 also this strategy with a ψstem threshold value of 2 5 mpa increased water productivity twofold with respect to the control ψstem around 1 2 mpa however oil yield may not necessarily be reduced with such strategies while moriana et al 2012 observed that oil yield cv morisca decreased using a ψstem threshold of 2 0 mpa trentacoste et al 2015 indicated that oil yield cv frantoio was not significantly affected using a ψstem threshold of 2 5 mpa finally ahumada orellana et al 2017 indicated that oil yield cv arbequina was also not reduced when irrigation was cut off from fruit set until reaching a ψstem threshold 3 5 mpa but it was significantly decreased with ψstem thresholds 5 0 mpa despite these assessments of oil yield there is little information about the effect of irrigation cut off on the olive oil quality for this reason the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of irrigation cut off strategies on quality attributes of monovarietal extra virgin olive oil from cv arbequina 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and experimental design the site description and experimental design are described in detail by ahumada orellana et al 2017 who evaluated the yield and water productivity responses to irrigation cut off strategies applied after fruit set using ψstem thresholds in a super high density olive orchard briefly an experiment was conducted during four consecutive growing seasons 2010 2011 to 2013 2014 in a 6 year old drip irrigated olive orchard olea europaea l cv arbequina located in the pencahue valley maule region chile 35 232 l s 71 442 w 96 m altitude the olive trees were trained under a hedgerow system with a planting density of 1333 tree ha 1 1 5 5 0 m and irrigation was performed using two 2 0 l h 1 drippers per tree using good quality water pumped from a nearby river at the experimental site the climate is mediterranean with rainfall occurring mostly during the winter months and the soil has a clay loam texture with a field capacity and wilting point of 31 and 16 cm3 cm 3 respectively the olive water requirements were calculated according to the standard fao56 approach for crop evapotranspiration etc eto kc where eto is the reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 and kc is the crop coefficient climate data for calculating eto were collected from an automated weather station installed over a reference grass and located about 2 km from the experimental site values of eto were estimated using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 ortega farías et al 1995 while those of kc were between 0 56 and 0 42 see lópez olivari et al 2016 the experimental design was completely randomized with four treatments t1 t2 t3 and t4 and four replications five trees per replication t1 was irrigated with 100 of etc during the growing season from september to april for t2 t3 and t4 the irrigation was cut off from fruit set about 20 days after full bloom until reaching ψstem thresholds of approximately 3 5 5 0 and 6 0 mpa respectively upon reaching these thresholds the irrigation was restored and maintained as t1 in all treatments until olives were harvested it is important to indicate that the period after fruit set always coincides with high atmospheric demands for water vapor and pit hardening which is the least sensitive to water deficit goldhamer 1999 gómez del campo and garcía 2013 2 2 plant water status measurements the midday stem water potential ψstem was measured weekly to monitor plant water status these measurements were performed between 12 30 and 14 00 h gómez del campo et al 2008 moriana and fereres 2002 using two apical twigs per plot from the current year with at least 10 leaves located in the middle of the canopy rousseaux et al 2008 secchi et al 2007 these twigs were covered in the canopy with a plastic bag and aluminum foil for 1 2 h before the measurements meyer and reicosky 1985 thereafter the twigs were removed from the tree for measurement using a scholander type pressure chamber pms instrument company model 1000 pressure chamber instrument scholander et al 1965 lastly in order to describe the accumulated effect of the irrigation cut off strategies the water stress integral sψ was calculated myers 1988 as 1 s ψ ψ s t e m c n where ψstem is the average of stem water potential for any interval mpa c is the value of the maximum stem water potential during the season and n is the number of the days in each interval ahumada orellana et al 2017 moriana et al 2007 2 3 fruit maturity index water content and oil content at harvest fruit were handpicked from each tree using small rakes fruit were harvested manually on 130 131 134 and 127 doy in 2011 2012 2013 and 2014 respectively fruit were separated from leaves and a sample was taken per plot 25 30 kg per treatment in the laboratory the water content of the olive paste was determined by desiccation and oil content by soxhlet extraction which was expressed as a percentage of fresh olive paste weight martín vertedor et al 2011 moreover a sample of 100 olives from each plot was used for calculating the fruit maturity index mi the 100 olives were distributed in eight groups according to the color of their skin and pulp group 0 bright green skin group 1 green yellowish skin group 2 green skin with reddish spots group 3 reddish brown skin group 4 black skin with white pulp group 5 black skin with 50 purple pulp group 6 black skin with 50 purple pulp and group 7 black skin and purple pulp finally mi was calculated as garcia and yousfi 2005 2 m i i n i 100 where i is the group number and ni the number of olives in each group 2 4 oil quality free acidity was determined as the percentage of oleic acid peroxide value pv was expressed as milliequivalents of active oxygen per kilogram of oil meq o2 kg extinction coefficients k232 k270 δk were measured in a spectrophotometer at wavelengths of 232 266 270 and 274 nm frías ruiz et al 2001 total polyphenols were determined by a colorimetric method using the folin ciocalteu reagent by spectrophotometry at 725 nm the result was expressed as ppm of caffeic acid tsimidou 1998 the oil fatty acid composition was determined by gas chromatography frías ruiz et al 2001 in this study the main oil fatty acids were palmitic acid palmitoleic acid stearic acid oleic acid linoleic acid and linolenic acid moreover the following variables were calculated based on the fatty acid composition 3 saturated fatty acid safa palmitic acid stearic acid 4 unsaturated fatty acid unfa palmitoleic acid oleic acid linoleic acid linolenic acid 5 monounsaturated fatty acid mufa palmitoleic acid oleic acid 6 polyunsaturated fatty acid pufa linoleic acid linolenic acid 2 5 sensory analysis sensory analysis of olive oil from each of the treatments was evaluated by quantitative descriptive analysis qda which was carried out by five evaluators the samples were provided in blue glass tumblers covered with another glass at room temperature approximately 20 c each evaluator classified the following terms olive fruit apple other fruits such as almonds and nuts bitter pungent sweet and cut grass on a numerical scale from 0 5 with 0 being imperceptible and 5 being an extreme perception of the intensity 2 6 statistical analysis treatment effects were evaluated by analysis of variance anova using the statistical software infostat universidad nacional de córdoba argentina the significant differences among the treatments were assessed using tukey s multiple range test p 0 05 a regression analysis was performed to determine the relationship between water stress integral and total polyphenols 3 results 3 1 environmental conditions the accumulated effective rainfall ranged beetwen 12 6 and 84 9 mm with maximum and minimum values observed during 2010 2011 and 2011 2012 growing seasons respectively both daily eto and daily average temperature showed a similar pattern with maximum values occurring during december and january for this southern hemisphere location fig 1 cumulative eto ranged between 986 and 1099 mm while daily average temperatures were between 15 5 and 18 3 c for the four growing season furthermore during the latter period of oil accumulation i e the 40 days before harvest the lowest and highest values of daily maximum temperature were observed during the 2010 11 and 2012 13 seasons respectively table 1 under these climatic conditions the net irrigation amount for t1 was between 183 and 268 mm season 1 fig 2 for the four seasons the water application for the t2 t3 and t4 treatments ranged between 75 and 83 62 76 and 56 70 of t1 respectively 3 2 plant water status the plant water status was described in detail by ahumada orellana et al 2017 the water status of each treatment is briefly described below the plant water status was similar for all treatments between the start of the irrigation season october and fruit set i e the start of water restriction in treatment t1 ψstem values oscillated between 1 3 and 2 2 mpa throughout the first season of study whereas in the other three seasons some lower values i e a minimum of 2 8 mpa did occur late in the summer when eto was high the treatments with irrigation cut off strategies t2 t3 and t4 decreased their ψstem progressively from the start of water restriction at fruit set until their predetermined threshold value was reached the t2 treatment reached its minimum value 3 5 mpa during pit hardening after about 35 days without irrigation the t3 treatment reached its minimum ψstem 5 0 mpa 49 53 days after irrigation cut off except for the 2012 13 season where it was 71 days the t4 treatment reached the ψstem threshold of around 6 0 mpa after 67 78 days without irrigation for most seasons but in the 2012 13 growing season it reached a minimum ψstem of only 5 2 mpa after 97 days once these minimum values were reached the irrigation was restored in the t2 t3 and t4 treatments and their ψstem returned to values similar to those of the t1 treatment at harvest the average water stress integral sψ for the t1 through t4 treatments was 100 1 125 2 210 1 and 255 4 mpa day 1 respectively 3 3 fruit maturity index water content and oil content the average maturity index mi of the treatments at harvest in the four seasons was between 1 42 and 1 56 but there were no significant differences among them table 2 moreover there were no significant differences among treatments for either fruit water content or oil content on a fresh weight basis at harvest which had values between 57 and 68 and 20 21 respectively oil content on a dry weight basis also did not show differences among treatments nevertheless there were significant differences among seasons in mi as well as fruit water and oil content in 2013 14 the mi 1 11 was lower than in the other seasons while oil content was statistically lower in both the 2013 14 and 2010 11 seasons than that observed in the 2011 12 season 3 4 oil quality for the four seasons the values of free acidity peroxide and extinction coefficients k232 k270 and δk were within the limits established for commercial extra virgin olive oil quality values of free acidity for the different irrigation treatments ranged between 0 21 and 0 32 with no significant differences among them table 3 the peroxide values presented significant differences among treatments being lower in treatments that had experienced a higher water deficit however the difference was only significant between the t1 and t3 treatments there were also significant differences among treatments for k232 and k270 extinction coefficients where the higher values were found in treatments with higher water deficit t3 and t4 in contrast the values of δk were more negative in the t3 and t4 treatments compared with t1 total polyphenols were higher in the water deficit treatments compared with t1 also total polyphenols of treatment t3 were significantly higher than t2 moreover total polyphenols showed a high linear correlation with sψ which explained the higher content of total polyphenols in treatments with water deficit in each season furthermore this relationship was strongly influenced by season fig 3 polyphenols showed high values at harvest in the 2011 12 and 2013 14 seasons but were much lower in 2012 13 table 3 in contrast the 2012 13 season showed the highest values of free acidity peroxide and δk compared to the other seasons as shown in table 4 there were no significant effects of irrigation cut off on most of the olive oil fatty acids such as palmitic oleic linoleic and linolenic acid however stearic acid was significantly higher in t3 and t4 while palmitoleic acid was significantly higher in the t2 treatment compared with t4 also there was a significant effect of season on the fatty acid composition in the 2010 11 season the samples presented the lowest level of palmitic acid while samples from the 2013 14 season presented the highest oleic acid and the lowest linoleic acid the ratios of unsa safa and mufa pufa were not significantly affected by the irrigation cut off treatments table 5 values of unfa safa and mufa pufa had a narrow range between 5 66 5 82 and 10 94 11 05 respectively however there were significant differences among seasons with maximum values observed in the 2013 14 season 3 5 sensory analysis the sensory profiles of the olive oils from the four seasons are shown in fig 4 the bitter and pungent attributes were more pronounced in olive oils from trees with higher water deficit t3 and t4 compared with non stressed trees t1 in all seasons moreover olive oil samples from the 2011 12 season showed the highest presence of fruity bitter and pungent attributes compared with other seasons none of the olive oils presented defects in the organoleptic evaluations 4 discussion our chilean study site has a mediterranean type climate with rainfall principally occurring during the winter and a summer that is usually dry and hot ortega farías and lópez olivari 2012 during the four seasons in which this study was conducted the meteorological conditions were as expected with maximum atmospheric demand during the summer however some differences in temperature between seasons were observed during the latter part of the oil accumulation period the results suggest that the irrigation cut off strategies implemented after fruit set did not affect olive ripening this was also observed by gómez del campo and garcía 2013 who indicated that water deficit in the summer did not affect the maturity index in a super high density olive orchard cv arbequina in spain the fruit oil and water contents in our study were also not affected by the irrigation cut off strategies these same variables were previously found to not be greatly affected by water deficit treatments that reached a ψstem of around 4 0 mpa in summer gómez rico et al 2007 iniesta et al 2009 the lack of change in oil content in the t2 and t3 treatments is likely a function of water stress mostly occurring during the pit hardening period rather than afterwards when most oil accumulation occurs however even the longer t4 treatment did not lead to reduced oil content additionally the fruit oil and water contents were similar to those found in other cv arbequina olive orchards from other regions with a mediterranean climate diez et al 2016 garcía et al 2013 grattan et al 2006 iniesta et al 2009 patumi et al 2002 in terms of olive oil quality parameters free acidity was not affected by the irrigation cut off strategies which is consistent with several previous studies of water deficit in olive trees garcía et al 2013 gómez del campo 2013b patumi et al 2002 peroxide values showed a tendency to decrease with water deficit coinciding with tovar et al 2002 in contrast many studies have reported no relationship between irrigation and peroxide values garcía et al 2013 gómez del campo and garcía 2013 patumi et al 2002 lastly dag et al 2008 observed that while peroxide content in the oil was not affected by irrigation other factors such as mechanical harvesting which is common in super high density olive orchards can affect peroxide content mechanically harvested fruit was more prone to injury than hand picked fruit in that study and this led to increased oxidation and hence peroxide values in the case of the extinction coefficients k232 and k270 higher values were obtained in the oils of the more severe water deficit treatments t3 t4 which is in accordance with the results obtained by ramos and santos 2010 in oils from cv cordovil despite these differences between treatments for some parameters the oils were within the limits established by the european regulation ec 1989 03 for all treatments allowing them to be classified as extra virgin oil quality total polyphenols of the olive oils were higher in the treatments associated with greater water deficit intensity as observed in other olive studies fernandes silva et al 2013 gómez rico et al 2007 lodolini et al 2014 motilva et al 2000 patumi et al 2002 tovar et al 2002 water stress as well as other abiotic stresses such as excessive light are generally well known to produce a greater synthesis of phenolic compounds in the fruit and leaves of many plant species reviewed by cheynier et al 2013 additionally linear relationships between total polyphenols and sψ were found in all four seasons fig 3 which coincides with the results of moriana et al 2007 these results are very important because total polyphenols are also closely related to the oxidative stability of olive oil fernandes silva et al 2013 therefore oil with a high polyphenol content will have a longer shelf life in relation to olive oil fatty acid composition irrigation cut off strategies did not affect the main fatty acids palmitic oleic and linoleic these results coincide with motilva et al 2000 who observed that water deficit did not affect oil fatty acid composition in cv arbequina in a fairly similar manner berenguer et al 2006 did not find differences in fatty acids in cv arbequina except for a very minor increase in oleic acid due to severe water deficit in one of two seasons additionally salas et al 1997 only observed differences in fatty acid composition between rain fed and irrigated olive orchards but differences between irrigation treatments were insignificant it is worth noting that the values of oleic acid content for cv arbequina found at our chilean study site were high about 75 and that high oleic acid is a positive attribute in olive oils for human health covas et al 2006 such values are not uncommon in mediterranean climates in europe borges et al 2017 gómez del campo and garcía 2013 but they are much higher than values about 50 reported for more continental sites in argentina where the climate is warmer rondanini et al 2014 2011 this is reaffirmed by morello et al 2006 who point out that the climatology may be more important in some cases than genetic factors in determining the chemical components that characterize olive oil quality among the environmental factors temperature plays a relevant role in the composition of acids through regulating fatty acid desaturases hernández et al 2011 environmental factors likely led to the statistically significant differences between seasons for fatty acid composition in our study although the changes in the percentages of the individual fatty acids were not large similarly other studies have also found differences in olive oil fatty acid composition between seasons fernandes silva et al 2013 tovar et al 2002 in our study the lowest concentrations of stearic and palmitic acids were found in the 2010 11 season and the highest concentrations in the 2013 14 season this result may be explained by borges et al 2017 who indicated that saturated fatty acids were closely influenced by maximum temperature in our study the 2010 11 season had the lowest maximum temperature while the 2013 14 season had the highest maximum temperature additionally the olive oils from the 2011 12 and 2012 13 seasons had the highest concentration of palmitoleic and linolenic acids which could be related to the temperature regime over the course of these seasons including high mean temperatures during the last period of oil accumulation garcía inza et al 2014 has previously reported that these fatty acids increase with temperature in manipulative heating experiments in cv arauco however it is somewhat counterintuitive based on many previous studies in cv arbequina e g mailer et al 2010 rondanini et al 2014 2011 that the statistically highest oleic acid a monounsaturated fatty acid was found in the 2013 14 season when temperature was maximum this is likely related to the low maturity index at harvest in 2013 14 compared to other seasons since oleic acid typically decreases in cv arbequina towards the end of the season as maturity index increases rondanini et al 2014 the sensory analysis showed that the bitter and pungent attributes were more pronounced in olive oils from trees with higher water deficit these results coincide with fernandes silva et al 2013 who indicated that these attributes are more pronounced in oils from trees with water stress because they have a strong relationship with polyphenol concentration these findings are very important because oil from cv arbequina is normally characterized as having a very light pungency and bitterness which often leads to its oil being blended with oils of other cultivars dabbou et al 2010 since irrigation cut off strategies produce a desirable increase in the intensity of these two attributes this could favor its consumption as a monovarietal oil 5 conclusion in summary our results indicate that the evaluated irrigation cut off strategies including those that reached values of 6 0 mpa do not affect the fruit oil content some parameters of oil quality peroxides and extinction coefficients showed minor differences between irrigation treatments however all treatments were within the limits established for the commercial extra virgin quality additionally main fatty acid compositions palmitic oleic linoleic and linolenic acids were not affected by irrigation cut off strategies although fatty acid composition was somewhat influenced by the climatic conditions of each season most interestingly our results over four seasons consistently showed that higher water deficit produced a greater polyphenol content which should increase the oil shelf life moreover greater polyphenols improved the organoleptic quality of the oil which could favor the consumption of monovarietal cv arbequina olive oil for these reasons the more severe irrigation cut offs t3 and t4 improved the oil quality of cv arbequina and reduce water use by 30 40 at our chilean site although some reduction in oil yield is likely with such water deficits based on previous observations ahumada orellana et al 2017 acknowledgements this study

11507,a widespread measure for improvement of soil water use efficiency wue in the semi arid region of china is ridge cultivation with plastic film mulching system however the modification of soil water and heat flow under this management system is not well understood the objective of this study was to understand soil water and heat coupling processes by monitoring and modeling of soil water and temperature dynamics in this system that is commonly used on the semi arid chinese loess plateau four treatments were investigated conventional fertilization ck control recommended fertilization rf straw mulching based on rf sm and straw mulching in furrows plus plastic film mulching on soil ridges based on rf fm based on the field monitoring results the process based model hydrus 2d was calibrated to simulate the soil hydrothermal processes for the different treatments each represented by specific boundary conditions at the soil surface the model simulations have a good agreement with the field observation showed that there are significant differences in soil water contents 5 among the four treatments with the fm treatment having the highest water storage and the highest wue while soil daily mean temperature was very similar the daily temperature fluctuations were significantly higher under the plastic film mulching compared to the other treatments the fm treatment performed better during the cold year than a warm year improved crop production and water resource use through reduced evaporation and elevated transpiration the modeling approach presented here is an efficient way to clarify the mechanisms of root zone water and temperature dynamics under mulching and or tillage that could be adopted for optimizing soil hydrothermal management in this region keywords winter wheat plastic film mulching water use efficiency hydrus 2d model 1 introduction with arid regions comprising about 45 of the earth s land surface dryland farming systems may constitute the world s largest biome that will be indispensable for future food production schimel 2010 limited precipitation is the major constraints to crop production in semiarid regions such as the chinese loess plateau zhang et al 2009 liu et al 2009 to overcome the shortage of water resources mulching is being widely applied within this region dong et al 2009 particularly ridge cultivation with plastic film mulching system fm which consists of alternate ridges and furrows with the ridges covered with plastic film was recently and intensively introduced to improve soil water storage and increase crop production li and gong 2002 historically straw mulch has been well tested in northwestern china li et al 2013 and plastic film mulch has been widely used since 1978 dong et al 2009 both mulch practices may greatly improve grain yields due to increased soil moisture liu et al 2009 and reduced soil evaporation steiner 1989 and increased or decreased topsoil temperatures depending on the growth period zhou et al 2009 however the decrease of grain yield was observed primarily due to the over consumption of plant available water during the first stage of wheat growth li et al 2001a b the fm treatment was considered to be the most efficient mulching arrangement to increase water use efficiency wue by maximizing the use of sparse rainfall li et al 2013 however the mechanisms behind are not clearly understood because soil micro topography and mulching result in a non uniform distribution of water and heat to optimize mulching practices it is essentially required to understand what extent the water and heat flow regime is modified in this system in previous studies soil moisture and temperature was compared among different mulching arrangements e g ridge cultivation with plastic film mulching full plastic film mulching or double furrow cultivation with plastic film mulching or mulching periods e g mulching during whole growing season or before maturity li et al 2004 zhou et al 2009 zhang et al 2012 however these studies did not distinguish the potential differences in soil water and temperature between plastic film mulched ridges and bare furrows in the entire root zone so water storage and wue could not be established with certainty qi et al 2016 water and heat flow in ridge and furrow systems are difficult to measure but modeling can help to better understand the complex interplay between water and heat a plastic film mulched ridge will direct runoff to the furrow filipovic et al 2016 where water then infiltrates and redistributes into the subsurface soil of the ridge which is driven by lateral matric potential gradients whereas an improperly designed ridge mulching system has disadvantages e g greater deep water percolation and even nutrient leaching less planting area and lower wue an optimally designed ridge furrow geometry should produce greater soil water storage and overall a higher wue zhang et al 2013a b in addition the greenhouse like effects introduced by the plastic film traps solar energy and thus may result in increased air and soil temperature beneath the film alternately the furrow may receive less direct solar energy because of the ridge shade that would likely result in lower rates of evaporation within the furrow the coupled soil water and heat flow processes under a fm system are complex and not well understood from a quantitative perspective several software packages are available to simulate soil water and heat flow based on richards equation such as svat jansson and halldin 1980 shaw flerchinger and saxton 1989 and hydrus 2d sejna et al 2011 hydrus 2d is a windows based computer software program for simulating water heat and or solute transport in a two dimensional 2d variably saturated porous medium the model has been used extensively to simulate water and or heat flow in agricultural soils abbasi et al 2004 kandelous and simunek 2010 understanding variables affecting soil water and temperature distribution through modeling is needed for optimized design and better mulching managements 2d models are particularly suitable for such modeling studies because the spatial configuration of ridge furrow cultivations can be explicitly taken into account dusek et al 2010 evaluated the effects of model dimensionality s1d and s2d models on water flow in a drip irrigated plastic film mulched field the hydrus 2d model have been proved to accurately simulate 2d soil water movement in ridge furrow irrigation system zhang et al 2013a b or under biodegradable plastic film mulch saglam et al 2017 while those models have addressed key issues of water flow in a 2d complex system ruidisch et al 2013 they did not account for soil heat flow which is an important variable that is affected by the mulching system based on our knowledge there is very limited hydrus 2d application in terms of fully coupled non isothermal water and heat simulation in 2d wang et al 2013 in this study our objectives are to 1 test a modeling approach for a cross sectional ridge furrow configuration by calibrating and validating the physically based hydrus 2d model 2 simulate 2d moisture and temperature distributions under different treatments and 3 clarify the interactions of soil water and temperature associated with climate conditions which may provide guidance for the efficient design of cultivation and mulching systems in the semiarid chinese loess plateau 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental sites and treatments the experiment was conducted for three cropping seasons i e 2010 2011 for season 1 2011 2012 for season 2 and 2012 2013 for season 3 at the changwu agricultural and ecological experimental station 35 28 n 107 88 e 1 200 m a s l which is a typical dryland farming area on the loess plateau of china jiang et al 2016 dryland farming is dominated by monoculture cropping systems that are mainly comprised of winter wheat triticum aestivum l the area has a dry moderate inner continental climate the average annual precipitation from 1957 to 2012 was 582 mm with 45 of the precipitation falling during the winter wheat growing season between october to june the annual mean air temperature is 9 7 c the soils are cumuli ustic isohumosols with a silt loam texture according to the chinese soil taxonomy gong and zhang 2007 the organic matter total

mulching in furrows 30 cm width 100 coverage with impermeable transparent film mulching 0 008 mm thick polyethylene placed on the soil ridges 30 cm width and 10 cm height fm nitrogen in the form of urea n 46 was applied at a rate of 162 kg n ha 1 for the ck treatment prior to sowing while the other three treatments received urea prior to sowing 112 kg n ha 1 broadcasting manually over the soil surface and then plowed into the subsurface as a basal dressing and a second time before reviving and 38 kg n ha 1 using a hole sowing machine following precipitation a 105 kg phosphorus p ha 1 was applied as calcium superphosphate p2o5 12 and 80 kg potassium k ha 1 were applied as potassium sulfate k2o 45 at the same time that the basal n fertilizer was applied to each plot each treatment was replicated four times in a completely randomized block design with each plot size 22 0 m in length and 6 0 m in width the distance between two adjacent plots was 1 5 m a high yielding wheat hybrid changwu 521 was selected for this study planting holes were spaced 15 cm apart with a 30 cm distance between plant rows and furrow seeding was used in the fm treatment in the sm plots straw was homogeneously distributed on the soil surface after the sowing operation in the fm plots the plastic film was laid out by hand over the ridges and the joints were secured by embedding the edges of plastic film into the soil after harvest the plastic film was kept in the field during the fallow season until the next planting at the end of september or early october at which time the plastic film was cleared wheat stalks removed and the plots were ploughed by spade there was no irrigation applied during the wheat growing season 2 2 field measurements before the measurements started in 2010 soil profiles were dug and fdr frequency domain reflectometry tubes theta probe pr2 delta t cambridge were installed within each plot the fdr sensors were used to manually record soil moisture at soil depths of 10 20 40 60 and 100 cm about once per week during the entire study the sensors were site specific calibrated in the field by comparing gravimetrically determined soil water contents with the readings a paired t test analysis was used to compare the soil properties for the different soil profiles which indicated no significant difference among the profiles table 1 each fm cultivation included two fdr tubes one measured the ridge under plastic film coverage fm r and one measured the furrow under straw coverage fm f the soil temperature at the 5 and 10 cm depths were recorded at 30 min intervals by tidbit v2 tiny temperature recorder onset computer corporation usa based on these measurements growing degree day gdd c values i e accumulated integral of soil temperature were calculated using the following equation 1 g d d t m e a n t b a s e where t base is the soil base temperature of 0 c for wheat growth ding et al 2016 and t mean is the daily mean soil temperature all t mean t base values were considered to be effectively equal to 0 c root parameters were measured using a minirhizotron root monitoring system within each plot the root tube was 150 cm long and was installed at an angle of 450 to the soil surface leaf area index lai was measured manually using at least 10 adjacent plants for each set of measurements the biomass and grain yields were measured for all plants selected from a 10 m2 area within each plot and determined based on the average of four plot replicates meteorological data used in the model was collected from a climate station located 2 km from the field monitoring site weather measurements included precipitation net radiation air temperature relative humidity and wind speed 2 3 water and heat flow equations we used the well known finite element model hydrus 2d as a framework of various simulations sejna et al 2011 hydrus software is a microsoft windows based modeling environment for the analysis of water flow and heat

which is normally set to 1 0 neglecting the effects of water vapor diffusion the soil thermal regime is modeled with the conduction convection heat flow equation e g nassar and horton 1992 7 c p t t x

profile mailhol et al 2007 the initial and boundary conditions for the simulation of the cross sectional ridge furrow configuration are shown in fig 1 the value specified initial and boundary conditions at each site were used initial conditions were set in the model in terms of measured moisture and temperatures in the different soil depths at the beginning of the simulation period the horizontal extension of the flow domain was set at 0 6 m coinciding with the two midway points of the inter row strip the vertical extension was fixed at 2 0 m the horizontal distribution of the initial water content and temperature were assumed to be uniform in all treatments the no flux boundary was used as the vertical side boundary of the flow domain at the bottom of the domain free drainage condition and zero flux soil temperature were used since the water table 60 m depth is located far below the domain of interest at the soil surface an upper boundary condition was imposed using atmospheric data of precipitation potential evaporation and transpiration and estimated soil surface temperature to differentiate how different mulching systems affect the partitioning of water and energy balance we assumed that the total input of rainfall and net radiation was same at each treatment zhao et al 2010 the value specific heat boundary condition i e soil surface temperature is calculated by the average of measured air temperature and respective soil temperature at 5 cm depth it is important to note that the current module of hydrus 2d cannot differentiate the difference between the mulches and the bare soil area physically in our study differences of surface covers between them are mimicked by the corrected upper boundary conditions based on the mulch materials f m and percentage of covered area c m the correction factor for mulching is calculated as 1 f m c m the values of the parameters for mulch material f m are suggested to vary between 0 5 for mulches of plant material and close to 1 0 for plastic film mulches allen et al 1998 in this way under straw mulch coverage the input evaporation was decreased by a factor of 0 5 and thus this amount was ascribed into input transpiration to account for the enhanced soil water storage enrique et al 1999 in contrast the plastic film mulched ridge is considered impermeable to evaporation and rainfall that is assumed to be immediately routed into the furrow saglam et al 2017 that is a zero boundary condition was applied at the ridge and the input precipitation in the furrow was increased by a factor of 2 to account for the increased runoff from the plastic film mulched ridge fig 1 similarly at the straw covered area rainfall input was reduced by straw interception as a function of straw type density and cover area and rainfall intensity and duration kozak et al 2007 which as well as the subsequent evaporation will be directly taken into account for the actual evaporation values note that one hole was place in the top of the ridge that was designed to permit possible water infiltration and evaporation losses occurring because of the partially disintegrated conditions of the plastic film mulch over time the potential evapotranspiration etp was estimated from the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 the potential evaporation ep and transpiration tp losses were partitioned according to beer s law as a function of the lai of plant materials covering the soil ritchie 1972 as follows 10a e p e t p e x p k c l a i 10b t p e t p e p where k c is the coefficient for the radiation extinction set to be 0 463 in addition to validate the simulated evapotranspiration et the inter row evaporation was directly measured with mini lysimeter within each treatment three plastic tubes of 5 4 cm diameter and 20 cm depth were pushed into soil that had been recently wetted by rainfall the tubes were removed from the soil and carefully sealed at the bottom with a plastic sheet to avoid drainage or water uptake afterwards the prepared lysimeters were inserted into holes of the same size previously prepared and the tops of the lysimeters were placed on the same level as the surroundings by weighing the lysimeter using an electronic balance with a 0 01 g resolution in intervals of four hours beginning at 8 a m and ending at 6 p m over five days each month in april may and june 2013 respectively the averaged water loss could be determined during this period we additionally employed the in situ monitoring system em50 decagon devices inc pullman wa usa with the em 5 sensors installed at 15 30 and 60 cm depths from the respective soil surface and separate within each ridge and each furrow for the fm treatment with a 2 m distance between the sensors the data was recorded in 30 min intervals note that our study is beneficial to obtain a reasonable partitioning of simulated et into actual evaporation and transpiration because the model considers coupled water and heat flow as well as plant transpiration accompanied with the defined root zone hydrothermal conditions consequently the modeled evaporation can be separately evaluated by the lysimeter measured values the flux data e g evaporation might be better than the point observed data e g soil water content for the model validation zhao et al 2010 according to the site specific root measurements the differences of root distribution between sites e g root length density may be parameterized at each site and thus the site specific root water uptake function was further considered in the modeling efforts fig 2 2 5 water and heat flow simulations model simulations were run in a backward mode the soil hydraulic parameters were initially computed based on our laboratory measurements and were further optimized by an inverse estimation zhao et al 2010 for the model calibration we ran the simulations on a daily time step with data for one growing period i e 2011 2012 which equates to 30 time series soil moisture values at each observation point in the model the simulation time was designed based on the phenological data via our field records which encompasses the period from early october and ends around late june the simulated soil profile was 200 cm deep with observation nodes located at 10 30 60 and 100 cm as a first step we simultaneously fitted all the van genuchten hydraulic parameters the optimization approach was based on levenberg marquardt non linear minimization method compared with the derived parameters from the measurement the calibrated α and n parameters from the inverse estimation are generally lower the calibrated soil hydraulic parameters are given in table 1 subsequently we validated those optimized parameters during another growing season of 2012 2013 to simulate the soil water and heat flows under the different treatments 2 6 statistical analysis the effects of the treatments on the measured parameters were evaluated by one way analysis of variance anova when the f values were significant duncan s new multiple range test was used to calculate the least significant difference lsd between means in all cases the differences were deemed to be significant if p 0 05 although hydrus 2d simulations were conducted for the entire growing period only those simulated results for which observed data are available were used in the calibration and evaluation processes optimizing efficiency as well as model efficiency was evaluated by the root mean square errors rmse and coefficient of determination r2 11a r m s e 1 n n i 1 p i o i 2 11b r 2 1 n i 1 p i o n i 1 o i o 2 where n is the number of observations and pi and oi are the simulated and measured values respectively 3 results and discussions 3 1 model calibration and validation the soil water content for the growth of winter wheat were highly influenced by the temporal distribution of the local precipitation and the mulching practices the daily soil water content values during the wheat growing season in the model calibration 2011 2012 were lower than the values in the model validation 2012 2013 due to scarce rainfall in the latter year fig 3 the results indicate that the topsoil water content 0 10 cm rapidly responded to rainfall events except for the ridge area that was mulched by the plastic film the low mean soil water contents within the ridge were clearly due to the plastic film impeding rainfall infiltration the soil moisture is almost constant at the soil layer below 60 cm indicating the quantity of rainfall was not sufficient to recharge the soil water at this depth the 10 cm soil water contents during the dry period were close to the permanent wilting point 5 0 jiang et al 2016 that would clearly indicate the occurrence of water stress the soil moisture in the rf was similar to the ck and was on average 2 5 lower than the mulched treatments throughout the profile these ranges would have represented the effects caused by the designed mulching system which was also confirmed by the model simulations the model simulated the soil moisture dynamics for all treatments reasonably well during the course of the calibration fig 3 the simulations followed the temporal variations of the measured values from the top to the bottom of soil profile during the growing season the simulated water contents in the deeper layers showed good agreement with the measured values and displayed the small seasonal changes the simulated water content at the 10 cm depth was overestimated during wet conditions high peaks but the estimations more closely followed the measured values during dry periods the overestimation may be partially due to the model not completely describing the characteristics of the mulching layer in our simulation design except for one hole on the top of ridge the mulched ridges had been assumed to completely impede water infiltration and that rain water would be immediately transferred to the furrow as runoff these modeling parameters may not accurately represent the effects of the plastic film mulching as some water may gain into the soil below the mulch entry e g pinholes or slight tears in the plastic slight misplacement of the plastic film on the ridge etc and that water would be retained within the soil there are similar trends of soil temperature among the different treatments with lower temperatures in the 2011 2012 fig 4 a than in the 2012 2013 fig 4b the topsoil temperatures under the plastic film mulching were higher than the values under non mulching conditions the model predicted the soil temperature dynamics for all treatments well during the course of the calibration 2011 2012 it was found that the simulations follow the temporal variations of the measured temperature throughout the year there are mismatches between measured and modeled temperature during the over wintering periods this could be associated with the heat release by inaccurate parameterization of soil thermal properties during the soil freezing and thawing processes which is not implemented in the current model zhao et al 2016 the temperature at the 5 cm depth was underestimated during dry conditions possibly due to the weak representation of soil thermal conductivity in the dry state but simulated the measured values well during the wet periods the model efficiency was validated by the simulation of 2012 2013 dataset figs 3 and 4 the model validation results showed similar trends with the calibration results confirming that the current hydrus 2d model is reasonable to reflect the water and heat dynamics under different mulching conditions it was found that the model consistently described the observed differences between the treatments the modeled results were also validated by the good agreement between the simulated and measured evaporation values fig 5 the simulated e was smaller than the measured value during the drought periods and was likely attributable to the model overestimating the resistance for water loss within the topsoil during this time the 0 10 cm soil water contents at the fm were much higher 5 than the other treatments fig 6 a it has been reported that mulching can reduce evaporation especially when the surface soil is wet ji and unger 2001 there was also a significantly higher value of soil moisture at the 30 cm soil depth under the plastic film mulching accordingly while the soil daily mean temperatures were similar among all the treatments the daily temperature fluctuations were significantly different for the different treatments fig 6b at the fm site the ridge covered by plastic film resulted in higher amplitudes of topsoil temperatures compared to the furrow covered by straw and indicated that the plastic film resulted in strong warming effects this result disagrees with the observations that plastic film mulch dampen the annual and daily soil temperature fluctuations by increasing the minimum and or decreasing the maximum soil temperatures petrone et al 2001 the statistical evaluation results for model performance are summarized in table 2 the range of the rmse and r2 values for soil water content and temperature were 0 061 0 135 0 43 0 82 and 0 032 0 055 0 89 0 96 respectively indicating the current model has an acceptable goodness of fit the statistical measures were similar for both model calibration and validation confirming that the applied modeling method is reasonable based on these values we conclude that hydrus 2d model performed reliably in simulating water flow and heat transport in our field experiments 3 2 simulation of mulching effects on coupled soil water and heat fluxes we evaluated the coupled water and heat flows as affected by the different mulching treatments through 2d simulations of the soil domain 0 6 m 2 m for three days may 21 23 that were associated with a rainfall event 14 mm on may 22 no rainfall for about one week before this date the mulching impact on the soil water movement was inferred from examining the directions of soil water flow fig 7 and the 2d contour lines of soil water distribution fig 8 obviously the surface mulch cover had a dramatic effect on the physical environment near the soil surface with the development of strong horizontal gradients across different mulched soil boundaries one day before the rainfall occurrence may 21 the water moved upwards due to water evaporation at the non mulching bare area or straw mulched furrow area however the water movement was strongly impeded by the plastic film mulching in the ridged area fig 7a therefore topsoil moisture was low due to the extended evaporative progress and the moisture was relatively higher in the mulched area fig 8a during the time period of rainfall velocities of water directed rapidly downwards due to rainfall recharging the lateral flow occurred with high flow velocities in the topsoil from the furrow area to the area beneath the plastic mulch confirmed an interflow phenomenon that the mulching and micro topography strongly influenced the water flow direction fig 7b in the fm plot the soil moisture significantly increased in the straw mulched furrow area where water can infiltrate into the deep soil while the water cannot recharge into the soil surface of the plastic film mulched area fig 8b consequently the soil moisture in the flat furrow area is much larger than in the ridge area due to the strong water focused flow within this system that may beneficial to the growth of the shallow rooting crops such as wheat among the three flat treatments except for the higher water status at the sm due to the reduced evaporation by the straw coverage the pattern of water movement was similar one day after the rainfall occurrence may 23 however while the water moved upwards at the topsoil of the non mulched area due to water evaporation water continuously moved downwards and laterally into the subsurface soil beneath plastic film mulching in the fm plot this explained that water contents generally decreased with the soil depth due to evaporation except for the fm plots where the soil moisture in 40 60 cm layer was increased by additional soil water that moved from the wetted furrow zone this movement assured quick drainage of the root zone particularly within the furrowed areas but it may concurrently increase the risk of nutrient leaching especially for the conventional fertilizer application dai et al 2016 working in the same area as our field site found that soil nitrate concentrations were higher at the 40 300 cm soil depth than in the topsoil 0 40 cm and that these nitrate concentrations at lower depths may possibly pose a threat to groundwater contamination the 2d distribution of soil temperature was similar among the three flat treatments except for the slightly lower values for the sm treatment fig 9 the high soil moisture in straw mulched soil resulted in a slow response of soil temperature to increased air temperatures and solar radiation due to the increased soil heat capacity that accompanied the higher moisture contents the straw mulching also prevented the soil surface from receiving direct sunlight and reduced soil radiation absorption chen et al 2007 however soil temperatures beneath the plastic film mulching was much higher than in the other areas of the fm treatment and confirmed the temperature measurements with an indication of warming effects caused by the plastic film mulching in contrast to soil moisture the mulching impact on soil temperature is relatively small especially for the straw coverage with the occurrence of rainfall the soil temperature decreased from the top to the bottom of the soil profile and demonstrated the coupled processes between soil water and heat 3 3 mulching effects on soil water and heat use efficiency compared with other three treatments the fm treatment increased gdd most significantly from the seeding stage to the over wintering stage especially for the first season which was a relatively cold period within the three different seasons table 3 this observed difference was presumably because solar energy heated the air and soil beneath the film mulch and prevented water exchange between the soil and air that in turn reduced the latent heat flux and the exchange of sensible heat between the soil and air wang and deng 1991 the plant canopy was small during the emergence stage which allowed the majority of the plastic film area to receive solar energy and warm the topsoil from the reviving stage to the maturity stage the heating effect was greater under the ck or rf treatments than under the two mulched treatments these reductions likely occurred because of canopy shading and potentially mulch shading as well indicated that the mulching applications during the latter stages of plant growth might reduce the heat flux instead of increasing the heat storage this observation is consistent with zhou et al 2009 who found that the effects of plastic film mulching on soil temperatures was larger during the early stages of growth because of sparse crop cover and that the effect decreased with canopy growth over time in accordance with this li et al 2012 also found that the full establishment of the plant canopy in the middle and later growth stages leads to a slightly increased or even decreased soil temperatures under plastic film mulching compared with non mulched plots for this reason it is recommended to remove the plastic film at the later stages of wheat growth the simulated annual water balance for each treatment is presented in table 4 the treatments effects on e and t dynamics illustrated that the presence of mulch clearly decreased the et by about 20 the soil evaporation rates in the non mulched ck and rf plots were much higher than the mulched plots whereas the transpiration rates were relatively similar between them and implied that the mulching applications increased the transpiration at the expense of soil evaporation the high t rates observed for plastic film mulching treatments might be associated to a well developed root system fig 2 among the four treatments the fm treatment showed the lowest deficiency of soil water storage owing to the water conservation effects of the plastic film mulch directly blocking the water exchange at the soil atmosphere interface zhang et al 2007 li et al 2013 furthermore the ridges in the fm treatments served as rainfall harvesting zones that increased the water flow to the deeper 30 60 cm soil layers in the furrow fig 8 compared with the ck the rf showed similar effects on soil water storage due to the similar surface conditions biomass and yield suggesting that the current recommended reduced fertilizer rates were reasonable dai et al 2016 the total precipitation during the wheat growing season in 2010 2011 2011 2012 and 2012 2013 was 199 0 328 0 and 149 9 mm respectively and represented average wet and dry years for crop seasons 1 2 and 3 respectively regardless of treatments the yield was the highest in the wetter year i e about twice higher than in the dry year indicated that the wheat production in this region is primarily regulated by the occurrence of local rainfall zhang et al 2013a b this result is consistent with many other field research studies that demonstrated crop yields fluctuate greatly over multiple years due to the uneven distribution of annual or inter annual precipitation berzsenyi et al 2000 note that although the yield for the fm treatment in the wetter year was double its yield in the drier year the wue for both years were similar that is likely attributable to reduced water consumption in the drier year the wue was higher for the fm followed by sm and then the other two non mulched treatments during the three years of the study table 4 mulching reduced the total et with significant reductions in the evaporation although the yield differences between treatments were not large this finding suggests that the plastic film mulching is beneficial in terms of water use most likely because of reduced evaporation along with relatively more soil water consumed by transpiration and a greater proportion of dry matter translocation into the grain table 4 for the two non mulched treatments the rf treatment gave a higher wue than the ck due main to the higher yield this may have suggested that the current recommended reduced fertilizer rates did not show the limit of nitrogen and have enhanced the transpiration water while the wue showed the highest values under the plastic film mulching treatment for any of the three seasons the yields were affected by the treatments and also varied with the different seasons it seems the plastic film mulching performed well to significantly increase yields only in the average water year remained constant in the wetter season and were decreased in the dry season p 0 05 these results are inconsistent with the patterns of many other studies which generally indicated that the plastic film increased yields in the dry years zhang et al 2007 li et al 2013 except for the water factors previously addressed it seems the mulch treatment works better in the cold portions of the year within the first two seasons rather than the warm portion of the year within the third season from table 3 we surprisingly found out that there were significantly decreased values of gdd attributable to mulching within the third season but no significant differences of gdd occurred for the first two seasons given the fact that from the jointing to the heading stage the average soil temperatures in the ck treatment were much higher than the values observed in both mulched plots within the third season but a reverse trend was found in the first two seasons we believe that non mulching primarily moderated soil temperatures that was more favorable for crop growth in this stage and that ultimately contributed to increased crop yields for the third season it has been reported that higher soil temperatures may result in more effective nutritional growth during the heading stage imran et al 2013 in the average rainfall season the wheat in the mulching treatments seemed not to be affected by the drought during the filling stage of 2010 2011 however it is thought that the drought likely constrained wheat growth in the control treatment plastic film mulch treatment or ridging cultivation reduced winter wheat root enrichment depths and increased root length densities fig 2 this result indicates that the fm tends to enhance wheat growth and yields which is not only dependent on the soil moisture values but also strongly regulated by suitable soil thermal conditions within the croplands of the semiarid loess plateau in china many studies have shown that plastic film mulching effectively promotes the wheat canopy development and yields primarily because of its influences on more favorable soil moisture and temperature conditions li et al 2004 jiang et al 2016 as early as 1975 unger 1975 reported that film mulching reduced soil evaporation and increased soil temperatures subsequent studies have confirmed that plastic film mulching resulted in increased soil temperatures li et al 2001a b anikwe et al 2007 increased radiation capture zhou et al 2009 liu et al 2010 and increased plant available soil moisture liu et al 2010 and thus increased crop yields zhou et al 2009 li et al 2013 these results are consistent with our observations of soil temperature and moisture that increased wheat yields within the mulched plots during the first two seasons however in the third season both the sm and fm treatments decreased the average soil temperatures and decreased wheat yields when compared to the ck treatment similarly the decreased soil temperature reduced wheat yields in the ck treatment more than the yield reductions for the two mulched plots with the first two seasons table 3 these results implied that soil temperature played a large role in the winter wheat yields especially during the cold season 3 4 management and modeling implication low quantities of precipitation with high spatial and temporal distribution limited groundwater and high water losses combine to make water scarcity the primary limiting factor for crop growth within the rain fed regions on the loess plateau ding et al 2016 to adapt to the extreme weather and environment conditions many local farmers incorporate plastic film mulching practices into their management plans to ensure safety for their field based crop production consistent with the common belief our studies showed that the mulched treatments resulted in lower et losses when compared with the no mulching treatments in general plastic film mulching should effectively reduce the ratio between non productive soil evaporation and productive plant transpiration the low e t ratios observed for plastic film mulching treatments are based on the enhanced the root water uptake due to the higher soil water contents and temperatures qin et al 2015 consistent with the expectations of reduction of e t ratios the plastic film mulching in our study caused improvements in the crop wue table 3 plastic film mulch can generally and effectively increase topsoil temperature and enhance crop establishment within cold spring regions zhang et al 2009 this study demonstrated that the cumulative gdd values in the upper soil layer were enhanced by the mulching treatments during the wetter year however the mulching treatment caused reductions during the drier year this result was somewhat unexpected and implied that during the dry year either straw or plastic film mulching practices contributed to the problems of low temperatures and limited water availability in spring that resulted in low wheat productivity on the semiarid loess plateau of northwestern china zhou et al 2012 as a result mulching treatments were found to only be effective in promoting seedling emergence and development through specific vegetative stages at the later stages of crop growth there is a limited amount of water left in the soil leading to decreased water utilization by the mulching treatment in a dry year like season 3 in this study these results indicated a mechanism that the fm performed better in a colder year than average year compared with a warmer year in the loess plateau area this study illustrated a coupled water and heat simulation via the model calibration and validation processes the current hydrus 2d model approaching has several merits 1 the approaching of 2d fully coupled non isothermal water and heat simulation was used which is indispensable required for the ridge cultivation with plastic film mulching system but less investigated previously 2 the simulated evaporation flux was confirmed by the measured values in which the verification for the fluxes data was considered even powerful than the point observed data and 3 the root water uptake function was modified by the in situ root measurements which normally was treated empirically to a less extent the boundary conditions associated with different mulching scenarios were mimicked based on the model capability and main field conditions behind 2d modeling in our study helps to better understand processes occurring during complex topographic and soil system simulations zhang et al 2007 however similar to many other models it is difficult to set the reasonable boundary conditions for the current model firstly the current model considered the simulation of temperature effects by mulching which affected latent heat that has gotten limited attention for its role in this complex system flerchinger et al 2003 it was worth noting that the soil temperatures under the straw mulched treatments were higher during colder weather and lower during warmer weather when compared with the non mulched soil this finding shows that mulching cannot be simply regarded as an additional soil layer the properties of optical thickness and even porosity i e flat straw is a layer with large porosity which can temporarily store water within the fabric of the mulch and thus contribute the water vapor flow are important to consider fabrizzi et al 2005 forcella et al 2000 suggested that soil temperature was most important for seedling emergence simulation clearly it is important to have accurate simulations of soil temperature that strongly influences crop emergence and subsequent yields especially in consideration that mulching affects the coupled water and heat transport secondly for plastic film mulching water is considered to runoff the plastic and infiltrate in the furrows at a ratio proportional to the mulch covered area dusek et al 2010 saglam et al 2017 this assumption may not be suitable in terms of accurately estimating intimate coupled water and heat transport fig 9 the problem becomes even more complex with the disintegration of the plastic film over time that makes the plastic film permeable to water disintegration of the plastic mulch can be explicitly considered in modeling when data on mulch deterioration is available saglam et al 2017 which oftentimes is not the case associated with these mismatches among many others it is better to employ the further investigations into model uncertainties and errors as well as model stability finally although our study have parameterized the function of root water uptake for estimating et the validation of root distribution and determination of root parameters need further research 4 conclusions in this study a combination of field measurements and process based model simulations were used to evaluate the effects of ridge cultivation with plastic film mulching in comparison to cultivation without plastic coverage and conventional flat tillage management on soil water and temperature dynamics the hydrus 2d model simulations showed a good agreement with the field observations presenting a flexible tool to demonstrate the complex soil water and heat interactions in the complex cultivation and mulching system it was demonstrated that mulching changes soil moisture patterns primarily in the topsoil compared to the other tillage systems and routed rain water from impermeable mulch areas to furrows where the water may infiltrate and more thoroughly wet the soil due to the increased water storage and t decreased e and et plastic film mulching was shown to be a very efficient practice for increasing wue in dryland agriculture the fm seemed to function better in a colder year than average year compared with a warmer year and confirmed the interactions of soil water and soil temperature this study illustrates that it is essential to understand the coupled soil water and heat processes and their contributions to crop yields and wue that are associated with cultivation and mulching methods under

11507,a widespread measure for improvement of soil water use efficiency wue in the semi arid region of china is ridge cultivation with plastic film mulching system however the modification of soil water and heat flow under this management system is not well understood the objective of this study was to understand soil water and heat coupling processes by monitoring and modeling of soil water and temperature dynamics in this system that is commonly used on the semi arid chinese loess plateau four treatments were investigated conventional fertilization ck control recommended fertilization rf straw mulching based on rf sm and straw mulching in furrows plus plastic film mulching on soil ridges based on rf fm based on the field monitoring results the process based model hydrus 2d was calibrated to simulate the soil hydrothermal processes for the different treatments each represented by specific boundary conditions at the soil surface the model simulations have a good agreement with the field observation showed that there are significant differences in soil water contents 5 among the four treatments with the fm treatment having the highest water storage and the highest wue while soil daily mean temperature was very similar the daily temperature fluctuations were significantly higher under the plastic film mulching compared to the other treatments the fm treatment performed better during the cold year than a warm year improved crop production and water resource use through reduced evaporation and elevated transpiration the modeling approach presented here is an efficient way to clarify the mechanisms of root zone water and temperature dynamics under mulching and or tillage that could be adopted for optimizing soil hydrothermal management in this region keywords winter wheat plastic film mulching water use efficiency hydrus 2d model 1 introduction with arid regions comprising about 45 of the earth s land surface dryland farming systems may constitute the world s largest biome that will be indispensable for future food production schimel 2010 limited precipitation is the major constraints to crop production in semiarid regions such as the chinese loess plateau zhang et al 2009 liu et al 2009 to overcome the shortage of water resources mulching is being widely applied within this region dong et al 2009 particularly ridge cultivation with plastic film mulching system fm which consists of alternate ridges and furrows with the ridges covered with plastic film was recently and intensively introduced to improve soil water storage and increase crop production li and gong 2002 historically straw mulch has been well tested in northwestern china li et al 2013 and plastic film mulch has been widely used since 1978 dong et al 2009 both mulch practices may greatly improve grain yields due to increased soil moisture liu et al 2009 and reduced soil evaporation steiner 1989 and increased or decreased topsoil temperatures depending on the growth period zhou et al 2009 however the decrease of grain yield was observed primarily due to the over consumption of plant available water during the first stage of wheat growth li et al 2001a b the fm treatment was considered to be the most efficient mulching arrangement to increase water use efficiency wue by maximizing the use of sparse rainfall li et al 2013 however the mechanisms behind are not clearly understood because soil micro topography and mulching result in a non uniform distribution of water and heat to optimize mulching practices it is essentially required to understand what extent the water and heat flow regime is modified in this system in previous studies soil moisture and temperature was compared among different mulching arrangements e g ridge cultivation with plastic film mulching full plastic film mulching or double furrow cultivation with plastic film mulching or mulching periods e g mulching during whole growing season or before maturity li et al 2004 zhou et al 2009 zhang et al 2012 however these studies did not distinguish the potential differences in soil water and temperature between plastic film mulched ridges and bare furrows in the entire root zone so water storage and wue could not be established with certainty qi et al 2016 water and heat flow in ridge and furrow systems are difficult to measure but modeling can help to better understand the complex interplay between water and heat a plastic film mulched ridge will direct runoff to the furrow filipovic et al 2016 where water then infiltrates and redistributes into the subsurface soil of the ridge which is driven by lateral matric potential gradients whereas an improperly designed ridge mulching system has disadvantages e g greater deep water percolation and even nutrient leaching less planting area and lower wue an optimally designed ridge furrow geometry should produce greater soil water storage and overall a higher wue zhang et al 2013a b in addition the greenhouse like effects introduced by the plastic film traps solar energy and thus may result in increased air and soil temperature beneath the film alternately the furrow may receive less direct solar energy because of the ridge shade that would likely result in lower rates of evaporation within the furrow the coupled soil water and heat flow processes under a fm system are complex and not well understood from a quantitative perspective several software packages are available to simulate soil water and heat flow based on richards equation such as svat jansson and halldin 1980 shaw flerchinger and saxton 1989 and hydrus 2d sejna et al 2011 hydrus 2d is a windows based computer software program for simulating water heat and or solute transport in a two dimensional 2d variably saturated porous medium the model has been used extensively to simulate water and or heat flow in agricultural soils abbasi et al 2004 kandelous and simunek 2010 understanding variables affecting soil water and temperature distribution through modeling is needed for optimized design and better mulching managements 2d models are particularly suitable for such modeling studies because the spatial configuration of ridge furrow cultivations can be explicitly taken into account dusek et al 2010 evaluated the effects of model dimensionality s1d and s2d models on water flow in a drip irrigated plastic film mulched field the hydrus 2d model have been proved to accurately simulate 2d soil water movement in ridge furrow irrigation system zhang et al 2013a b or under biodegradable plastic film mulch saglam et al 2017 while those models have addressed key issues of water flow in a 2d complex system ruidisch et al 2013 they did not account for soil heat flow which is an important variable that is affected by the mulching system based on our knowledge there is very limited hydrus 2d application in terms of fully coupled non isothermal water and heat simulation in 2d wang et al 2013 in this study our objectives are to 1 test a modeling approach for a cross sectional ridge furrow configuration by calibrating and validating the physically based hydrus 2d model 2 simulate 2d moisture and temperature distributions under different treatments and 3 clarify the interactions of soil water and temperature associated with climate conditions which may provide guidance for the efficient design of cultivation and mulching systems in the semiarid chinese loess plateau 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental sites and treatments the experiment was conducted for three cropping seasons i e 2010 2011 for season 1 2011 2012 for season 2 and 2012 2013 for season 3 at the changwu agricultural and ecological experimental station 35 28 n 107 88 e 1 200 m a s l which is a typical dryland farming area on the loess plateau of china jiang et al 2016 dryland farming is dominated by monoculture cropping systems that are mainly comprised of winter wheat triticum aestivum l the area has a dry moderate inner continental climate the average annual precipitation from 1957 to 2012 was 582 mm with 45 of the precipitation falling during the winter wheat growing season between october to june the annual mean air temperature is 9 7 c the soils are cumuli ustic isohumosols with a silt loam texture according to the chinese soil taxonomy gong and zhang 2007 the organic matter total nitrogen available phosphorus available potassium and inorganic nitrogen contents for the 0 20 cm soil depth at the beginning of the experiment are 11 8 g kg 1 0 87 g kg 1 14 4 mg kg 1 144 6 mg kg 1 and 3 15 mg kg 1 respectively in this experiment four treatments were evaluated 1 the flat cultivation with the conventional fertilization ck control 2 the flat cultivation with the recommended reduced fertilization rf 3 the same with rf plus straw mulching 100 surface coverage with all straw ca 4 500 kg ha 1 harvested from the previous wheat sm and 4 the recommended fertilization plus straw mulching in furrows 30 cm width 100 coverage with impermeable transparent film mulching 0 008 mm thick polyethylene placed on the soil ridges 30 cm width and 10 cm height fm nitrogen in the form of urea n 46 was applied at a rate of 162 kg n ha 1 for the ck treatment prior to sowing while the other three treatments received urea prior to sowing 112 kg n ha 1 broadcasting manually over the soil surface and then plowed into the subsurface as a basal dressing and a second time before reviving and 38 kg n ha 1 using a hole sowing machine following precipitation a 105 kg phosphorus p ha 1 was applied as calcium superphosphate p2o5 12 and 80 kg potassium k ha 1 were applied as potassium sulfate k2o 45 at the same time that the basal n fertilizer was applied to each plot each treatment was replicated four times in a completely randomized block design with each plot size 22 0 m in length and 6 0 m in width the distance between two adjacent plots was 1 5 m a high yielding wheat hybrid changwu 521 was selected for this study planting holes were spaced 15 cm apart with a 30 cm distance between plant rows and furrow seeding was used in the fm treatment in the sm plots straw was homogeneously distributed on the soil surface after the sowing operation in the fm plots the plastic film was laid out by hand over the ridges and the joints were secured by embedding the edges of plastic film into the soil after harvest the plastic film was kept in the field during the fallow season until the next planting at the end of september or early october at which time the plastic film was cleared wheat stalks removed and the plots were ploughed by spade there was no irrigation applied during the wheat growing season 2 2 field measurements before the measurements started in 2010 soil profiles were dug and fdr frequency domain reflectometry tubes theta probe pr2 delta t cambridge were installed within each plot the fdr sensors were used to manually record soil moisture at soil depths of 10 20 40 60 and 100 cm about once per week during the entire study the sensors were site specific calibrated in the field by comparing gravimetrically determined soil water contents with the readings a paired t test analysis was used to compare the soil properties for the different soil profiles which indicated no significant difference among the profiles table 1 each fm cultivation included two fdr tubes one measured the ridge under plastic film coverage fm r and one measured the furrow under straw coverage fm f the soil temperature at the 5 and 10 cm depths were recorded at 30 min intervals by tidbit v2 tiny temperature recorder onset computer corporation usa based on these measurements growing degree day gdd c values i e accumulated integral of soil temperature were calculated using the following equation 1 g d d t m e a n t b a s e where t base is the soil base temperature of 0 c for wheat growth ding et al 2016 and t mean is the daily mean soil temperature all t mean t base values were considered to be effectively equal to 0 c root parameters were measured using a minirhizotron root monitoring system within each plot the root tube was 150 cm long and was installed at an angle of 450 to the soil surface leaf area index lai was measured manually using at least 10 adjacent plants for each set of measurements the biomass and grain yields were measured for all plants selected from a 10 m2 area within each plot and determined based on the average of four plot replicates meteorological data used in the model was collected from a climate station located 2 km from the field monitoring site weather measurements included precipitation net radiation air temperature relative humidity and wind speed 2 3 water and heat flow equations we used the well known finite element model hydrus 2d as a framework of various simulations sejna et al 2011 hydrus software is a microsoft windows based modeling environment for the analysis of water flow and heat

profile mailhol et al 2007 the initial and boundary conditions for the simulation of the cross sectional ridge furrow configuration are shown in fig 1 the value specified initial and boundary conditions at each site were used initial conditions were set in the model in terms of measured moisture and temperatures in the different soil depths at the beginning of the simulation period the horizontal extension of the flow domain was set at 0 6 m coinciding with the two midway points of the inter row strip the vertical extension was fixed at 2 0 m the horizontal distribution of the initial water content and temperature were assumed to be uniform in all treatments the no flux boundary was used as the vertical side boundary of the flow domain at the bottom of the domain free drainage condition and zero flux soil temperature were used since the water table 60 m depth is located far below the domain of interest at the soil surface an upper boundary condition was imposed using atmospheric data of precipitation potential evaporation and transpiration and estimated soil surface temperature to differentiate how different mulching systems affect the partitioning of water and energy balance we assumed that the total input of rainfall and net radiation was same at each treatment zhao et al 2010 the value specific heat boundary condition i e soil surface temperature is calculated by the average of measured air temperature and respective soil temperature at 5 cm depth it is important to note that the current module of hydrus 2d cannot differentiate the difference between the mulches and the bare soil area physically in our study differences of surface covers between them are mimicked by the corrected upper boundary conditions based on the mulch materials f m and percentage of covered area c m the correction factor for mulching is calculated as 1 f m c m the values of the parameters for mulch material f m are suggested to vary between 0 5 for mulches of plant material and close to 1 0 for plastic film mulches allen et al 1998 in this way under straw mulch coverage the input evaporation was decreased by a factor of 0 5 and thus this amount was ascribed into input transpiration to account for the enhanced soil water storage enrique et al 1999 in contrast the plastic film mulched ridge is considered impermeable to evaporation and rainfall that is assumed to be immediately routed into the furrow saglam et al 2017 that is a zero boundary condition was applied at the ridge and the input precipitation in the furrow was increased by a factor of 2 to account for the increased runoff from the plastic film mulched ridge fig 1 similarly at the straw covered area rainfall input was reduced by straw interception as a function of straw type density and cover area and rainfall intensity and duration kozak et al 2007 which as well as the subsequent evaporation will be directly taken into account for the actual evaporation values note that one hole was place in the top of the ridge that was designed to permit possible water infiltration and evaporation losses occurring because of the partially disintegrated conditions of the plastic film mulch over time the potential evapotranspiration etp was estimated from the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 the potential evaporation ep and transpiration tp losses were partitioned according to beer s law as a function of the lai of plant materials covering the soil ritchie 1972 as follows 10a e p e t p e x p k c l a i 10b t p e t p e p where k c is the coefficient for the radiation extinction set to be 0 463 in addition to validate the simulated evapotranspiration et the inter row evaporation was directly measured with mini lysimeter within each treatment three plastic tubes of 5 4 cm diameter and 20 cm depth were pushed into soil that had been recently wetted by rainfall the tubes were removed from the soil and carefully sealed at the bottom with a plastic sheet to avoid drainage or water uptake afterwards the prepared lysimeters were inserted into holes of the same size previously prepared and the tops of the lysimeters were placed on the same level as the surroundings by weighing the lysimeter using an electronic balance with a 0 01 g resolution in intervals of four hours beginning at 8 a m and ending at 6 p m over five days each month in april may and june 2013 respectively the averaged water loss could be determined during this period we additionally employed the in situ monitoring system em50 decagon devices inc pullman wa usa with the em 5 sensors installed at 15 30 and 60 cm depths from the respective soil surface and separate within each ridge and each furrow for the fm treatment with a 2 m distance between the sensors the data was recorded in 30 min intervals note that our study is beneficial to obtain a reasonable partitioning of simulated et into actual evaporation and transpiration because the model considers coupled water and heat flow as well as plant transpiration accompanied with the defined root zone hydrothermal conditions consequently the modeled evaporation can be separately evaluated by the lysimeter measured values the flux data e g evaporation might be better than the point observed data e g soil water content for the model validation zhao et al 2010 according to the site specific root measurements the differences of root distribution between sites e g root length density may be parameterized at each site and thus the site specific root water uptake function was further considered in the modeling efforts fig 2 2 5 water and heat flow simulations model simulations were run in a backward mode the soil hydraulic parameters were initially computed based on our laboratory measurements and were further optimized by an inverse estimation zhao et al 2010 for the model calibration we ran the simulations on a daily time step with data for one growing period i e 2011 2012 which equates to 30 time series soil moisture values at each observation point in the model the simulation time was designed based on the phenological data via our field records which encompasses the period from early october and ends around late june the simulated soil profile was 200 cm deep with observation nodes located at 10 30 60 and 100 cm as a first step we simultaneously fitted all the van genuchten hydraulic parameters the optimization approach was based on levenberg marquardt non linear minimization method compared with the derived parameters from the measurement the calibrated α and n parameters from the inverse estimation are generally lower the calibrated soil hydraulic parameters are given in table 1 subsequently we validated those optimized parameters during another growing season of 2012 2013 to simulate the soil water and heat flows under the different treatments 2 6 statistical analysis the effects of the treatments on the measured parameters were evaluated by one way analysis of variance anova when the f values were significant duncan s new multiple range test was used to calculate the least significant difference lsd between means in all cases the differences were deemed to be significant if p 0 05 although hydrus 2d simulations were conducted for the entire growing period only those simulated results for which observed data are available were used in the calibration and evaluation processes optimizing efficiency as well as model efficiency was evaluated by the root mean square errors rmse and coefficient of determination r2 11a r m s e 1 n n i 1 p i o i 2 11b r 2 1 n

water content for the growth of winter wheat were highly influenced by the temporal distribution of the local precipitation and the mulching practices the daily soil water content values during the wheat growing season in the model calibration 2011 2012 were lower than the values in the model validation 2012 2013 due to scarce rainfall in the latter year fig 3 the results indicate that the topsoil water content 0 10 cm rapidly responded to rainfall events except for the ridge area that was mulched by the plastic film the low mean soil water contents within the ridge were clearly due to the plastic film impeding rainfall infiltration the soil moisture is almost constant at the soil layer below 60 cm indicating the quantity of rainfall was not sufficient to recharge the soil water at this depth the 10 cm soil water contents during the dry period were close to the permanent wilting point 5 0 jiang et al 2016 that would clearly indicate the occurrence of water stress the soil moisture in the rf was similar to the ck and was on average 2 5 lower than the mulched treatments throughout the profile these ranges would have represented the effects caused by the designed mulching system which was also confirmed by the model simulations the model simulated the soil moisture dynamics for all treatments reasonably well during the course of the calibration fig 3 the simulations followed the temporal variations of the measured values from the top to the bottom of soil profile during the growing season the simulated water contents in the deeper layers showed good agreement with the measured values and displayed the small seasonal changes the simulated water content at the 10 cm depth was overestimated during wet conditions high peaks but the estimations more closely followed the measured values during dry periods the overestimation may be partially due to the model not completely describing the characteristics of the mulching layer in our simulation design except for one hole on the top of ridge the mulched ridges had been assumed to completely impede water infiltration and that rain water would be immediately transferred to the furrow as runoff these modeling parameters may not accurately represent the effects of the plastic film mulching as some water may gain into the soil below the mulch entry e g pinholes or slight tears in the plastic slight misplacement of the plastic film on the ridge etc and that water would be retained within the soil there are similar trends of soil temperature among the different treatments with lower temperatures in the 2011 2012 fig 4 a than in the 2012 2013 fig 4b the topsoil temperatures under the plastic film mulching were higher than the values under non mulching conditions the model predicted the soil temperature dynamics for all treatments well during the course of the calibration 2011 2012 it was found that the simulations follow the temporal variations of the measured temperature throughout the year there are mismatches between measured and modeled temperature during the over wintering periods this could be associated with the heat release by inaccurate parameterization of soil thermal properties during the soil freezing and thawing processes which is not implemented in the current model zhao et al 2016 the temperature at the 5 cm depth was underestimated during dry conditions possibly due to the weak representation of soil thermal conductivity in the dry state but simulated the measured values well during the wet periods the model efficiency was validated by the simulation of 2012 2013 dataset figs 3 and 4 the model validation results showed similar trends with the calibration results confirming that the current hydrus 2d model is reasonable to reflect the water and heat dynamics under different mulching conditions it was found that the model consistently described the observed differences between the treatments the modeled results were also validated by the good agreement between the simulated and measured evaporation values fig 5 the simulated e was smaller than the measured value during the drought periods and was likely attributable to the model overestimating the resistance for water loss within the topsoil during this time the 0 10 cm soil water contents at the fm were much higher 5 than the other treatments fig 6 a it has been reported that mulching can reduce evaporation especially when the surface soil is wet ji and unger 2001 there was also a significantly higher value of soil moisture at the 30 cm soil depth under the plastic film mulching accordingly while the soil daily mean temperatures were similar among all the treatments the daily temperature fluctuations were significantly different for the different treatments fig 6b at the fm site the ridge covered by plastic film resulted in higher amplitudes of topsoil temperatures compared to the furrow covered by straw and indicated that the plastic film resulted in strong warming effects this result disagrees with the observations that plastic film mulch dampen the annual and daily soil temperature fluctuations by increasing the minimum and or decreasing the maximum soil temperatures petrone et al 2001 the statistical evaluation results for model performance are summarized in table 2 the range of the rmse and r2 values for soil water content and temperature were 0 061 0 135 0 43 0 82 and 0 032 0 055 0 89 0 96 respectively indicating the current model has an acceptable goodness of fit the statistical measures were similar for both model calibration and validation confirming that the applied modeling method is reasonable based on these values we conclude that hydrus 2d model performed reliably in simulating water flow and heat transport in our field experiments 3 2 simulation of mulching effects on coupled soil water and heat fluxes we evaluated the coupled water and heat flows as affected by the different mulching treatments through 2d simulations of the soil domain 0 6 m 2 m for three days may 21 23 that were associated with a rainfall event 14 mm on may 22 no rainfall for about one week before this date the mulching impact on the soil water movement was inferred from examining the directions of soil water flow fig 7 and the 2d contour lines of soil water distribution fig 8 obviously the surface mulch cover had a dramatic effect on the physical environment near the soil surface with the development of strong horizontal gradients across different mulched soil boundaries one day before the rainfall occurrence may 21 the water moved upwards due to water evaporation at the non mulching bare area or straw mulched furrow area however the water movement was strongly impeded by the plastic film mulching in the ridged area fig 7a therefore topsoil moisture was low due to the extended evaporative progress and the moisture was relatively higher in the mulched area fig 8a during the time period of rainfall velocities of water directed rapidly downwards due to rainfall recharging the lateral flow occurred with high flow velocities in the topsoil from the furrow area to the area beneath the plastic mulch confirmed an interflow phenomenon that the mulching and micro topography strongly influenced the water flow direction fig 7b in the fm plot the soil moisture significantly increased in the straw mulched furrow area where water can infiltrate into the deep soil while the water cannot recharge into the soil surface of the plastic film mulched area fig 8b consequently the soil moisture in the flat furrow area is much larger than in the ridge area due to the strong water focused flow within this system that may beneficial to the growth of the shallow rooting crops such as wheat among the three flat treatments except for the higher water status at the sm due to the reduced evaporation by the straw coverage the pattern of water movement was similar one day after the rainfall occurrence may 23 however while the water moved upwards at the topsoil of the non mulched area due to water evaporation water continuously moved downwards and laterally into the subsurface soil beneath plastic film mulching in the fm plot this explained that water contents generally decreased with the soil depth due to evaporation except for the fm plots where the soil moisture in 40 60 cm layer was increased by additional soil water that moved from the wetted furrow zone this movement assured quick drainage of the root zone particularly within the furrowed areas but it may concurrently increase the risk of nutrient leaching especially for the conventional fertilizer application dai et al 2016 working in the same area as our field site found that soil nitrate concentrations were higher at the 40 300 cm soil depth than in the topsoil 0 40 cm and that these nitrate concentrations at lower depths may possibly pose a threat to groundwater contamination the 2d distribution of soil temperature was similar among the three flat treatments except for the slightly lower values for the sm treatment fig 9 the high soil moisture in straw mulched soil resulted in a slow response of soil temperature to increased air temperatures and solar radiation due to the increased soil heat capacity that accompanied the higher moisture contents the straw mulching also prevented the soil surface from receiving direct sunlight and reduced soil radiation absorption chen et al 2007 however soil temperatures beneath the plastic film mulching was much higher than in the other areas of the fm treatment and confirmed the temperature measurements with an indication of warming effects caused by the plastic film mulching in contrast to soil moisture the mulching impact on soil temperature is relatively small especially for the straw coverage with the occurrence of rainfall the soil temperature decreased from the top to the bottom of the soil profile and demonstrated the coupled processes between soil water and heat 3 3 mulching effects on soil water and heat use efficiency compared with other three treatments the fm treatment increased gdd most significantly from the seeding stage to the over wintering stage especially for the first season which was a relatively cold period within the three different seasons table 3 this observed difference was presumably because solar energy heated the air and soil beneath the film mulch and prevented water exchange between the soil and air that in turn reduced the latent heat flux and the exchange of sensible heat between the soil and air wang and deng 1991 the plant canopy was small during the emergence stage which allowed the majority of the plastic film area to receive solar energy and warm the topsoil from the reviving stage to the maturity stage the heating effect was greater under the ck or rf treatments than under the two mulched treatments these reductions likely occurred because of canopy shading and potentially mulch shading as well indicated that the mulching applications during the latter stages of plant growth might reduce the heat flux instead of increasing the heat storage this observation is consistent with zhou et al 2009 who found that the effects of plastic film mulching on soil temperatures was larger during the early stages of growth because of sparse crop cover and that the effect decreased with canopy growth over time in accordance with this li et al 2012 also found that the full establishment of the plant canopy in the middle and later growth stages leads to a slightly increased or even decreased soil temperatures under plastic film mulching compared with non mulched plots for this reason it is recommended to remove the plastic film at the later stages of wheat growth the simulated annual water balance for each treatment is presented in table 4 the treatments effects on e and t dynamics illustrated that the presence of mulch clearly decreased the et by about 20 the soil evaporation rates in the non mulched ck and rf plots were much higher than the mulched plots whereas the transpiration rates were relatively similar between them and implied that the mulching applications increased the transpiration at the expense of soil evaporation the high t rates observed for plastic film mulching treatments might be associated to a well developed root system fig 2 among the four treatments the fm treatment showed the lowest deficiency of soil water storage owing to the water conservation effects of the plastic film mulch directly blocking the water exchange at the soil atmosphere interface zhang et al 2007 li et al 2013 furthermore the ridges in the fm treatments served as rainfall harvesting zones that increased the water flow to the deeper 30 60 cm soil layers in the furrow fig 8 compared with the ck the rf showed similar effects on soil water storage due to the similar surface conditions biomass and yield suggesting that the current recommended reduced fertilizer rates were reasonable dai et al 2016 the total precipitation during the wheat growing season in 2010 2011 2011 2012 and 2012 2013 was 199 0 328 0 and 149 9 mm respectively and represented average wet and dry years for crop seasons 1 2 and 3 respectively regardless of treatments the yield was the highest in the wetter year i e about twice higher than in the dry year indicated that the wheat production in this region is primarily regulated by the occurrence of local rainfall zhang et al 2013a b this result is consistent with many other field research studies that demonstrated crop yields fluctuate greatly over multiple years due to the uneven distribution of annual or inter annual precipitation berzsenyi et al 2000 note that although the yield for the fm treatment in the wetter year was double its yield in the drier year the wue for both years were similar that is likely attributable to reduced water consumption in the drier year the wue was higher for the fm followed by sm and then the other two non mulched treatments during the three years of the study table 4 mulching reduced the total et with significant reductions in the evaporation although the yield differences between treatments were not large this finding suggests that the plastic film mulching is beneficial in terms of water use most likely because of reduced evaporation along with relatively more soil water consumed by transpiration and a greater proportion of dry matter translocation into the grain table 4 for the two non mulched treatments the rf treatment gave a higher wue than the ck due main to the higher yield this may have suggested that the current recommended reduced fertilizer rates did not show the limit of nitrogen and have enhanced the transpiration water while the wue showed the highest values under the plastic film mulching treatment for any of the three seasons the yields were affected by the treatments and also varied with the different seasons it seems the plastic film mulching performed well to significantly increase yields only in the average water year remained constant in the wetter season and were decreased in the dry season p 0 05 these results are inconsistent with the patterns of many other studies which generally indicated that the plastic film increased yields in the dry years zhang et al 2007 li et al 2013 except for the water factors previously addressed it seems the mulch treatment works better in the cold portions of the year within the first two seasons rather than the warm portion of the year within the third season from table 3 we surprisingly found out that there were significantly decreased values of gdd attributable to mulching within the third season but no significant differences of gdd occurred for the first two seasons given the fact that from the jointing to the heading stage the average soil temperatures in the ck treatment were much higher than the values observed in both mulched plots within the third season but a reverse trend was found in the first two seasons we believe that non mulching primarily moderated soil temperatures that was more favorable for crop growth in this stage and that ultimately contributed to increased crop yields for the third season it has been reported that higher soil temperatures may result in more effective nutritional growth during the heading stage imran et al 2013 in the average rainfall season the wheat in the mulching treatments seemed not to be affected by the drought during the filling stage of 2010 2011 however it is thought that the drought likely constrained wheat growth in the control treatment plastic film mulch treatment or ridging cultivation reduced winter wheat root enrichment depths and increased root length densities fig 2 this result indicates that the fm tends to enhance wheat growth and yields which is not only dependent on the soil moisture values but also strongly regulated by suitable soil thermal conditions within the croplands of the semiarid loess plateau in china many studies have shown that plastic film mulching effectively promotes the wheat canopy development and yields primarily because of its influences on more favorable soil moisture and temperature conditions li et al 2004 jiang et al 2016 as early as 1975 unger 1975 reported that film mulching reduced soil evaporation and increased soil temperatures subsequent studies have confirmed that plastic film mulching resulted in increased soil temperatures li et al 2001a b anikwe et al 2007 increased radiation capture zhou et al 2009 liu et al 2010 and increased plant available soil moisture liu et al 2010 and thus increased crop yields zhou et al 2009 li et al 2013 these results are consistent with our observations of soil temperature and moisture that increased wheat yields within the mulched plots during the first two seasons however in the third season both the sm and fm treatments decreased the average soil temperatures and decreased wheat yields when compared to the ck treatment similarly the decreased soil temperature reduced wheat yields in the ck treatment more than the yield reductions for the two mulched plots with the first two seasons table 3 these results implied that soil temperature played a large role in the winter wheat yields especially during the cold season 3 4 management and modeling implication low quantities of precipitation with high spatial and temporal distribution limited groundwater and high water losses combine to make water scarcity the primary limiting factor for crop growth within the rain fed regions on the loess plateau ding et al 2016 to adapt to the extreme weather and environment conditions many local farmers incorporate plastic film mulching practices into their management plans to ensure safety for their field based crop production consistent with the common belief our studies showed that the mulched treatments resulted in lower et losses when compared with the no mulching treatments in general plastic film mulching should effectively reduce the ratio between non productive soil evaporation and productive plant transpiration the low e t ratios observed for plastic film mulching treatments are based on the enhanced the root water uptake due to the higher soil water contents and temperatures qin et al 2015 consistent with the expectations of reduction of e t ratios the plastic film mulching in our study caused improvements in the crop wue table 3 plastic film mulch can generally and effectively increase topsoil temperature and enhance crop establishment within cold spring regions zhang et al 2009 this study demonstrated that the cumulative gdd values in the upper soil layer were enhanced by the mulching treatments during the wetter year however the mulching treatment caused reductions during the drier year this result was somewhat unexpected and implied that during the dry year either straw or plastic film mulching practices contributed to the problems of low temperatures and limited water availability in spring that resulted in low wheat productivity on the semiarid loess plateau of northwestern china zhou et al 2012 as a result mulching treatments were found to only be effective in promoting seedling emergence and development through specific vegetative stages at the later stages of crop growth there is a limited amount of water left in the soil leading to decreased water utilization by the mulching treatment in a dry year like season 3 in this study these results indicated a mechanism that the fm performed better in a colder year than average year compared with a warmer year in the loess plateau area this study illustrated a coupled water and heat simulation via the model calibration and validation processes the current hydrus 2d model approaching has several merits 1 the approaching of 2d fully coupled non isothermal water and heat simulation was used which is indispensable required for the ridge cultivation with plastic film mulching system but less investigated previously 2 the simulated evaporation flux was confirmed by the measured values in which the verification for the fluxes data was considered even powerful than the point observed data and 3 the root water uptake function was modified by the in situ root measurements which normally was treated empirically to a less extent the boundary conditions associated with different mulching scenarios were mimicked based on the model capability and main field conditions behind 2d modeling in our study helps to better understand processes occurring during complex topographic and soil system simulations zhang et al 2007 however similar to many other models it is difficult to set the reasonable boundary conditions for the current model firstly the current model considered the simulation of temperature effects by mulching which affected latent heat that has gotten limited attention for its role in this complex system flerchinger et al 2003 it was worth noting that the soil temperatures under the straw mulched treatments were higher during colder weather and lower during warmer weather when compared with the non mulched soil this finding shows that mulching cannot be simply regarded as an additional soil layer the properties of optical thickness and even porosity i e flat straw is a layer with large porosity which can temporarily store water within the fabric of the mulch and thus contribute the water vapor flow are important to consider fabrizzi et al 2005 forcella et al 2000 suggested that soil temperature was most important for seedling emergence simulation clearly it is important to have accurate simulations of soil temperature that strongly influences crop emergence and subsequent yields especially in consideration that mulching affects the coupled water and heat transport secondly for plastic film mulching water is considered to runoff the plastic and infiltrate in the furrows at a ratio proportional to the mulch covered area dusek et al 2010 saglam et al 2017 this assumption may not be suitable in terms of accurately estimating intimate coupled water and heat transport fig 9 the problem becomes even more complex with the disintegration of the plastic film over time that makes the plastic film permeable to water disintegration of the plastic mulch can be explicitly considered in modeling when data on mulch deterioration is available saglam et al 2017 which oftentimes is not the case associated with these mismatches among many others it is better to employ the further investigations into model uncertainties and errors as well as model stability finally although our study have parameterized the function of root water uptake for estimating et the validation of root distribution and determination of root parameters need further research 4 conclusions in this study a combination of field measurements and process based model simulations were used to evaluate the effects of ridge cultivation with plastic film mulching in comparison to cultivation without plastic coverage and conventional flat tillage management on soil water and temperature dynamics the hydrus 2d model simulations showed a good agreement with the field observations presenting a flexible tool to demonstrate the complex soil water and heat interactions in the complex cultivation and mulching system it was demonstrated that mulching changes soil moisture patterns primarily in the topsoil compared to the other tillage systems and routed rain water from impermeable mulch areas to furrows where the water may infiltrate and more thoroughly wet the soil due to the increased water storage and t decreased e and et plastic film mulching was shown to be a very efficient practice for increasing wue in dryland agriculture the fm seemed to function better in a colder year than average year compared with a warmer year and confirmed the interactions of soil water and soil temperature this study illustrates that it is essential to understand the coupled soil water and heat processes and their contributions to crop yields and wue that are associated with cultivation and mulching methods under

introduction irrigation water management is necessary for structural economic and environmental reasons population growth is expected to double food demand by 2050 in order to achieve food security there is a need for a change in agricultural water management mueller et al 2012 irrigated agriculture as the largest water user is subjected to water allocation cuts due to rapid growth in water demand from non agricultural sectors e g domestic industrial and environmental use levidow et al 2014 there is a need for a highly efficient agricultural water management strategy to reduce water loss through surface runoff this can be achieved through irrigation scheduling irrigation scheduling is important for both water savings and improved crop yields phocaides 2007 irrigation scheduling is a systematic method by which the farmer or producer decides when to irrigate and how much water to apply van der geluk 2006 irrigation scheduling can lead to increased profit without compromising the environment by increasing productive water use reducing water loss through surface runoff deep percolation beyond the crop root zone which also results in nutrient leaching and soil evaporation reinders 2010 the interest in scheduling irrigation with crop growth models is rapidly increasing jovanovic and annandale 2000 simulation models mathematically describe the processes of soil water

rideco zapata et al 2012 and didas friedman et al 2016 the soil water balance swb computer model was identified by the water research commission south africa as a potential technology that could be adopted for real time irrigation scheduling country wide annandale et al 2002 the swb model was developed by the university of pretoria department of plant production and soil science in 1999 annandale et al 1999 as a real time user friendly irrigation scheduling tool benadė et al 1997 it is based on the improved generic crop version of the new soil water balance model described by campbell and diaz 1988 according to campos et al 2016 such soil water balance models can be powerful tools to predict crop responses under different climatic and management scenarios since swb is a generic crop growth model parameters specific for each crop have to be determined jovanovic and annandale 2000 in previous studies a database of crop specific growth parameters was generated for annual crops and pasture species barnard et al 1998 winter vegetables jovanovic et al 1999 19 summer vegetables jovanovic and annandale 2000 and sunflower jovanovic et al 2000 therefore the objective of this study was to calibrate and validate the swb generic crop model for dry beans cv dbs 360 to enable accurate irrigation scheduling under well watered conditions the model can then also be used to run scenarios to predict crop response to water supply under both irrigated and dryland conditions which is useful for irrigation scheduling and production planning purposes 2 model description the swb model gives a detailed description of the soil plant atmosphere system making use of weather soil and crop databases which are used to calculate the water balance and crop growth the functioning of the swb model is briefly described below a more detailed description of the model can be found in annandale et al 1999 the purpose of the weather unit of swb is to calculate the potential

assess crop response to drought stress was established at the hatfield experimental farm of the university of pretoria pretoria south africa in march 2013 the indeterminate dry bean variety dbs 360 was subjected to different drought stress treatments see mathobo et al 2017 for details the soil properties were similar to those of the soil used for model parameterization the experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design with six replications plot size was 2 m x 2 5 m and beans were planted at an inter row spacing of 0 3 m and intra row spacing of 0 075 m soil water content was measured weekly using a calibrated neutron probe plots were irrigated using a drip irrigation system nitrogen was applied as a top dressing 28 dap using lan 28 n at a rate of 30 kg ha 1 n the two drought stress treatments used to validate the model were as follows 1 irrigated weekly to field capacity and withholding irrigation from 49 dap for 24 days s2 pod filling stage whereafter weekly irrigation to field capacity was resumed until the end of the growing season 2 initially irrigated weekly to field capacity whereafter it was irrigated to field capacity on a fortnightly basis from 36 dap s3 until the end of the growing season 3 6 data collection for model validation plant height was measured and destructive samples taken from three plants per plot at 48 62 and 92 dap the samples were divided into leaves stems and pods and lai was measured using an li 3100 belt driven leaf area meter samples were then oven dried for 72 h at 65 c to determine dry matter yields grain

different localities in limpopo province namely trichardtsdal dzindi and tshiombo these localities fall in an important dry bean production area where farmers produce certified seed for the province the aim of the scenario simulations was to predict the dry bean yields that farmers can expect to harvest with good crop management in each of these localities the site specific information for each locality is presented in table 1 scenario simulations were run for the nine year period 2007 2015 for which weather data was available the weather data used for the simulations was obtained from the crop production directorate of the limpopo department of agriculture 4 results and discussion 4 1 model calibration table 2 displays a list of crop growth specific parameters determined for dry bean

the correlation between fi par and lai of dry beans the calculated value of kpar was 0 84 which falls within the range of 0 4 1 15 that was reported by allen et al 1998 for dry beans the coefficient of determination r2 for the exponetial function was 0 99 the swb model was calibrated for the dry bean cultivar dbs 360 using the parameters that were developed from the calibration data set table 2 calibration was based on field measurements of lai fipar biomass produced measured soil water deficits and grain yield root depth was not measured but estimated from depth of soil water extraction leaf area index was slightly overestimated early in the season but improved substantially from the middle to the end of the season fig 2 a r2 0 56 d 0 76 and mae 21 the top dry matter yields were predicted very well while harvestable yield was predicted with lower accuracy overall dry matter yields were simulated with reasonable accuracy for the calibration data set fig 2b r2 0 98 d 0 99 and mae 11 soil water deficits were also predicted with reasonable accuracy for the calibration data set with r2 0 86 d 0 95 and mae 17 fig 2c 4 2 model validation the model validation results for the treatment that was stressed during the late reproductive stage pod filling s2 are presented in fig 3 the leaf area index fig 3a r2 1 d 0 99 and mae 10 top and harvestable dry matter yields fig 3b r2 0 94 d 0 93 and mae 13 and soil water deficits fig 3c r2 0 75 d 0 90 and mae 19 were predicted with reasonable to good accuracy similarly the leaf area index top and harvestable dry matter yields and soil water deficits were predicted with reasonable to good accuracy for plants that were irrigated only once in two weeks s3 fig 4 the simulated leaf area index matched the measured values well throughout the entire growing season fig 4a r2 0 97 d 0 99 and mae 11 the simulated harvestable and top dry matter yields followed the same trend as measured values but were generally underestimated by the model throughout the growing season fig 4b r2 0 90 d 0 78 and mae 16 the soil water deficits were predicted with less accuracy especially from mid season onwards when the crop was irrigated less frequently fig 4c r2 0 54 d 0 76 and mae 18 these results suggest that the swb model was able to simulate crop growth water use and yield of the dry bean cultivar dbs 360 with reasonable accuracy under different water supply conditions the swb model can therefore be used with confidence to predict the growth water use and yield of this cultivar under different conditions for future planning purposes 4 3 scenario modelling table 3 presents the simulated grain yield of dry bean cultivar dbs 360 under irrigation for nine years at three localities trichardtsdal dzindi and tshiombo in limpopo province the rainfall received during the respective growing seasons is also indicated in table 1 simulation results of the nine years show that dry bean grain yields varied between 1 3 and 2 7 t ha 1 across years and localities which fall in the range of yields 1 6 and 2 5 t ha 1 reported for the region by mathobo and marais 2017 dzindi gave the highest average yield 2 4 t ha 1 across years and tshiombo the lowest 2 1 t ha 1 the obvious differences between localities are their soil types and temperatures dzindi has a higher clay content 38 with higher water holding capacity than the other two localities 28 29 clay this locality also has the highest average minimum and maximum temperatures which are favourable for dry bean production dodd 1991 the variation in yields observed across years could probably be attributed to seasonal rainfall distribution as water stress and very hot spells during flowering and pod filling can seriously hamper yields mathobo et al 2017 in spite of some supplementary irrigation uneven rainfall distribution can also affect temperatures and therefore plant growth pod set and final yield 5 conclusions a database of crop specific model parameters was generated for the dry bean cultivar dbs 360 the swb model was subsequently successfully calibrated and validated on an independent data set the calibrated model was used to predict dry bean grain yield for a period of nine years at three localities in limpopo these simulations suggested that annual rainfall distribution soil type and temperatures have a major impact on dry bean yields this will result in substantial yield variations across localities and years although actual long term yield data was not available for comparison with scenario simulation results we have confidence that the calibrated swb model is useful to estimate dry bean yields under various production conditions it is however recommended that crop parameters should also be determined for other common dry bean cultivars in order to make the swb model more useful for irrigation scheduling long term scenario modelling and planning purposes acknowledgements we would like to thank the limpopo department of agriculture and support staff of the university of pretoria for their invaluable support during this study 
11508,the worldwide decrease in available irrigation water is driving the need for the development of methods to minimize water losses in crop production a field experiment was conducted at the hatfield experimental farm of the university of pretoria pretoria south africa 25 45 0 s 28 16 0 e and altitude of 1327 m a s l in 2013 the objectives of the study were to determine crop specific model parameters for dry beans and to successfully calibrate and validate the soil water balance swb model for predicting dry bean yield and water use from historical weather data model simulations of leaf area index total dry mass harvestable dry mass and soil water deficits agreed reasonably well with measured values and statistical parameters for most variables were within acceptable limits the swb model simulated leaf area index total dry mass harvestable dry mass and soil water deficits for drought stress treatments reasonably well the calibrated model was then used to predict dry bean

successfully used to estimate yields of dry beans under various conditions and at other localities keywords leaf area index total dry mass scenario modeling water management yield forecast 1 introduction irrigation water management is necessary for structural economic and environmental reasons population growth is expected to double food demand by 2050 in order to achieve food security there is a need for a change in agricultural water management mueller et al 2012 irrigated agriculture as the largest water user is subjected to water allocation cuts due to rapid growth in water demand from non agricultural sectors e g domestic industrial and environmental use levidow et al 2014 there is a need for a highly efficient agricultural water management strategy to reduce water loss through surface runoff this can be achieved through irrigation scheduling irrigation scheduling is important for both water savings and improved crop yields phocaides 2007 irrigation scheduling is a systematic method by which the farmer or producer decides when to irrigate and how much water to apply van der geluk 2006 irrigation scheduling can lead to increased profit without compromising the environment by increasing productive water use reducing water loss through surface runoff deep percolation beyond the crop root zone which also results in nutrient leaching and soil evaporation reinders 2010 the interest in scheduling irrigation with crop growth models is rapidly increasing jovanovic and annandale 2000 simulation models mathematically describe the processes of soil water balance plant growth and yield expression to determine their evolution during the simulation period abazi et al 2013 a number of models have been developed to manage irrigation for example swb jovanovic and annandale 2000 singels et al 2010 budget raes et al 2006 osiri chopart et al 2007 swat luo et al 2008 swap vazifedoust et al 2008 pilote khaledian et al 2009 aquacrop steduto et al 2009 rideco zapata et al 2012 and didas friedman et al 2016 the soil water balance swb computer model was identified by the water research commission south africa as a potential technology that could be adopted for real time irrigation scheduling country wide annandale et al 2002 the swb model was developed by the university of pretoria department of plant production and soil science in 1999 annandale et al 1999 as a real time user friendly irrigation scheduling tool benadė et al 1997 it is based on the improved generic crop version of the new soil water balance model described by campbell and diaz 1988 according to campos et al 2016 such soil water balance models can be powerful tools to predict crop responses under different climatic and management scenarios since swb is a generic crop growth model parameters specific for each crop have to be determined jovanovic and annandale 2000 in previous studies a database of crop specific growth parameters was generated for annual crops and pasture species barnard et al 1998 winter vegetables jovanovic et al 1999 19 summer vegetables jovanovic and annandale 2000 and sunflower jovanovic et al 2000 therefore the objective of this study was to calibrate and validate the swb generic crop model for dry beans cv dbs 360 to enable accurate irrigation scheduling under well watered conditions the model can then also be used to run scenarios to predict crop response to water supply under both irrigated and dryland conditions which is useful for irrigation scheduling and production planning purposes 2 model description the swb model gives a detailed description of the soil plant atmosphere system making use of weather soil and crop databases which are used to calculate the water balance and crop growth the functioning of the swb model is briefly described below a more detailed description of the model can be found in annandale et al 1999 the purpose of the weather unit of swb is to calculate the potential evapotranspiration from available meteorological input data allen et al 1998 smith and smith 1992 smith et al 1996 daily penman monteith grass reference evapotranspiration eto and crop potential evapotranspiration pet are calculated and used by the soil unit to compute actual crop transpiration t and soil evaporation e the purpose of the soil unit of swb is to simulate the dynamics of water movement in the soil profile to determine e and t the swb model has a multilayer soil component and water contents and potentials of the various layers are calculated on a daily time step cascading water movement is simulated once canopy water interception and surface runoff have been accounted for jovanovic et al 2000 potential evapotranspiration pet is divided into potential evaporation and potential transpiration by calculating canopy radiant interception from simulated leaf area ritchie 1972 in the crop unit swb calculates crop dry matter accumulation in direct proportion to transpiration corrected for vapour pressure deficit of the environment tanner and sinclair 1983 the model also calculates radiation limited growth monteith 1977 and uses the lesser of the two daily dry matter yields jovanovic and annandale 2000 this dry matter is partitioned into roots stems leaves and grain or fruits partitioning depends on the phenology which is calculated using thermal time and modified by water stress 3 materials and methods 3 1 experimental details for model parameterization and calibration a field experiment was conducted at the hatfield experimental farm of the

adaptive capacity and reducing the environmental footprints keywords portfolio of management practices systems productivity water productivity economic profitability energy efficiency global warming potential 1 introduction in south asia home to about 1 5 billion people slowdown in the growth rate of cereal production and increasing population pressure have emerged as formidable challenges for the future food and nutritional security these challenges will be more intense under emerging scenarios of natural resource degradation energy crisis volatile markets and risks associated with global climate change jat et al 2016 lal 2016 during 1965 2015 in process of achieving multi fold increase in crop production in the region inefficient use and inappropriate management of non climate production resources water energy agro chemicals have vastly impacted the quality of the natural resources and also increased vulnerability to climatic variability affecting farming adversely the natural resources in south asia especially in indo gangetic plains igp are 3 5 times more stressed due to population economic and political pressures compared to rest of the world jat 2017 this can potentially add to climatic risks and making a large number of people more vulnerable to climatic hazards in the region further in south asia during last one decade the growth rate of the agriculture production is not significantly increased with the population which leads to more risk with no scope for horizontal expansion of farming the future food demand of growing population has to be met mainly through increasing yield per unit area with lesser external inputs labor water and energy while protecting the environment achieving all these under more variable and uncertain climatic condition at present and future is the foremost challenges of present time all across the igp lal 2013 jat et al 2016 campbell et al 2016 having high risks of climate change induced extreme weather events the crop yields in the region are predicted to decrease from 10 to 40 by 2050 with risks of crop failure in several highly vulnerable areas jat 2017 increase variability in both temperature and rainfall patterns changes in water availability shift in growing season rising frequency of extreme events such as terminal heat floods storms droughts sea level rise salinization and perturbations in ecosystems have already affected the livelihood of millions of people rice wheat rw is the most important cropping system for food security in south asia 13 5 mha providing food for more than 400 million people ladha et al 2003 the concerns of natural resource degradation and increased intensity of risks associated with weather variability in the intensively cultivated igp the food bowl of south asia are multiplying the area under the rw system covers 32 and 42 of total rice and wheat area respectively saharawat et al 2012 and is almost static and the productivity and sustainability of the system are threatened because of the inefficiency of current production practices shortage of resources such as water and labour open field burning of crop residues and socioeconomic changes ladha et al 2003 chauhan et al 2012 lohan et al 2018 further climate change on the one hand and changing land use pattern natural resource degradation especially land and water urbanization and increasing pollution on the other hand could affect the ecosystem in this region directly and also indirectly through their impacts on climatic variables lal 2016 for example about 51 of the igp may become unsuitable for wheat crop a major food security crop for india due to increased heat stress by 2050 lobell et al 2012 ortiz et al 2008 similarly water table in north western igp being depleted at 13 17 km3 yr 1 rodell et al 2009 due to over pumping for rice will have serious impacts on rice production therefore adaptation to climate change is no longer an option but a compulsion to minimize the loss due to adverse impacts of climate change and reduce vulnerability ipcc 2014 moreover while maintaining a steady pace of development the region would also need to reduce its environmental footprint from agriculture management practices that provide opportunities to reduce ghgs emission and increasing carbon sequestration is required for resilience in production systems sapkota et al

included land rent depreciation of machinery and interest on working capital variable costs included human labour tractor operational charges and cost of production inputs such as seed fertilizer pesticide irrigation harvesting threshing cleaning etc the cost of human labour used was based on labour days ha assuming an 8 h working day as per labour law of india all these fixed and variable costs were summed up to calculate total cost of production gross returns were obtained as per the prevailing market prices of the commodity grain and straw over the different years table 5 net returns were calculated by deducting the total cost of cultivation from the gross returns 2 9 irrigation management a 6 inch polyvinyl chloride pvc pipeline was installed in a 60 cm deep trench with an outlet for each plot separately on line water meter woltman helical turbine was fitted for irrigation water measurement water meter readings were recorded at the start and at the end irrigation to calculate

analysis the greenhouse gases ghgs emissions were calculated by using ccafs mot i e mitigation options tool developed by climate change agriculture and food security ccafs in collaboration with the university of aberdeen feliciano et al 2015 which estimates the performance of production system from ghg emission perspective both in terms of land use efficiency and efficiency per unit of product the model calculates background and fertilizer induced emissions based on multivariate empirical model of bouwman et al 2002 for nitrous oxide n2o and nitric oxide no emissions and the model of fao ifa 2001 for ammonia nh3 emission emissions from crop residues returned to the field were calculated using ipcc n2o tier 1 emission factors similarly emissions from the production and transportation of fertilizer were based on ecoinvent database ecoinvent center 2007 changes in soil carbon c due to tillage and residue management are based on ipcc methodology as in ogle et al 2005 and smith et al 1997 similarly emissions of co2 from soil resulting from urea application are estimated using ipcc methodology ipcc 2006 to estimate the total ghg emissions from the production systems i e global warming potential gwp eq 8 all ghgs are converted into co2 equivalents co2e using the global warming potential over 100 years of 34 and 298 for ch4 and n2o respectively ipcc 2013 eq 8 yield scaled gwp

many researchers gathala et al 2011 2014 kamboj et al 2012 jat et al 2014 from the same region with best management practices while some studies reported lower yield under dsr after 2 or 3 years under zt condition kumar et al 2018 sharma et al 2015 our result reconfirms the benefit of dsr in subsequent wheat in rw system as also reported by jat et al 2014 and kumar et al 2018 puddling the field during rice season results in compaction of the field resulting in poor rooting of subsequent wheat crops whereas growing rice without puddling dsr improves the soil physical properties gathala et al 2011 jat et al 2017 and increase soil organic matter choudhary et al 2018b jat et al 2017 sidhu et al 2015 ensuring better germination and root development of subsequent wheat crop aryal et al 2016 better root development and deeper penetration improves the uptake of water and nutrients jat et al 2017 poor performances of winter crops following puddled transplanted rice is also reported by other researchers in the region jat et al 2009 saharawat et al 2010 gathala et al 2011 and have attributed this to deteriorated soil condition compaction and increased bulk density the yield difference between normal and bad years was much higher in fp and the lowest in csa h indicating that the scenario which bundled all possible csa practices offered maximum adaptation to this climatic risk intensive tillage based scenarios showed water stagnation for long period due to untimely rainfall which ultimately turned into lower grain yield but such factors did not influence grain yield under zt scenarios gathala et al 2011 aryal et al 2016 higher rw system productivity with climate smart agriculture practices might be due to improved management practices precise land levelling humphreys et al 2010 efficient cultivar proper tillage and crop establishment gathala et al 2014 jat et al 2014 kumar et al 2018 precise water management choudhary et al 2018a and higher nutrient availability jat et al 2017 higher net returns were associated with csaps followed by ifps due to lower cost of cultivation incurred in tillage crop establishment irrigation cost and higher crop yields tables 7 and 8 avoiding tillage puddling and manual transplanting in rice and adoption of zero till dsr reduced tillage and establishment cost by 79 85 gathala et al 2011 lesser water and labour requirement reduced the input costs to a great extent in dsr erenstein and laxmi 2008 laik et al 2014 saharawat et al 2010 2012 compared to transplanted rice tpr higher crop yields and lower production cost in csaps resulted in to higher profitability of rw system deployment of ca based indicators tillage crop establishment residue nutrient and water management under rice wheat systems in igp resulted in higher net returns gathala et al 2014 jat et al 2014 sharma et al 2015 kumar et al 2018 due to lower production costs and higher crop productivity compared with farmers practice 4 2 water productivity direct seeded rice dsr under csaps csa l csa m and csa h required 20 29 less water than tpr system under fp table 8 which was comparable to the saving reported by nawaz et al 2017 who stated 19 water saving with dsr over tpr in rw system some other researchers mahajana et al 2012 jat et al 2009 choudhary et al 2018a kumar et al 2018 reported 15 50 water saving in dsr compared to tpr across south asia and opined that it can further be increased by using smart water management techniques mishra et al 2013 had also revealed that short term weather forecasts 5 days could reduce average water application by 27 in csaps scenarios avoiding puddling which requires around 3 4 irrigation and keeping crop residues on the soil surface probably minimized development of cracks thereby reducing water loss gathala et al 2014 kamboj et al 2012 kumar et al 2018 residue retention in zt wheat based system reduces the water requirement by conserving soil moisture reducing evaporation loss and minimizing competitions between crop plants and weeds by suppressing weed population erenstein et al 2008 sidhu et al 2015 gathala et al 2014 kumar et al 2018 sharma et al 2015 higher water productivity of zt wheat under csaps than in farmers practice fp was due to elimination of pre sowing irrigation thereby requiring less water coupled with higher grain yield under zt conditions kumar et al 2018 higher water productivity of dsr zt wheat and ca based rw rotation was also recorded by gathala et al 2014 from the same district and they attributed this to better grain yields with less water consumption similarly jat et al 2009 2011 have also reported higher water productivity with 50 less irrigation water under precise laser land levelling compared to traditional land levelling 4 3 energy productivity the higher energy input was associated with tillage labor irrigation and nitrogenous fertilizers in fps compared to csaps srivastava 2003 kumar et al 2013 and aravindakshan et al 2015 reported that intensive tillage before planting required about one third of the total operational energy that could be saved without adversely affecting the yield with zero tillage barut et al 2011 and ladha et al 2015 also found that intensive tillage for crop establishment higher amount of irrigation water higher labour and fertilizer inputs are the major factors for higher energy usage under current production systems laik et al 2014 and gathala et al 2016 confirmed that intensive tillage are the major factors contributing up to 40 higher energy usage than improve agronomic management practices in rw system higher use efficiency and productivity of energy in rice wheat as well as rw system under csa scenarios csa l csa m and csa h was mainly due to lower energy input and higher energy output in these scenarios as compared to fp our results are in close conformity with that of laik et al 2014 ladha et al 2015 parihar et al 2017 2018 and kumar et al 2018 who also reported lower energy input and higher output energy energy use efficiency and energy productivity with improved ca based management practices 4 4 mitigation potential the major sources of emission in our study were production transportation and application of fertilizer residue management and water management in rice the estimated ghg emission from our study are in close conformity with the work reported from india bhatia et al 2005 datta et al 2009 malla et al 2005 as well as global meta analysis by linquist et al 2012 rice ch4 emission was different under different scenarios i e dsr vs tpr this was because although frequency of irrigation was higher in tpr than in dsr both water management system could be broadly categorized as multiple drainage padre et al 2016 through their field measurement in same area reported that switching tpr to zt dsr reduced ch4 emissions by 56 without significant increases in n2o emissions reduction of gwp under csaps was primarily due to the use of neem coated n fertilizer lower nitrogen amount as a result of ssnm techniques and proper residue management reduction of gwp in the rage of 44 47 without any significant yield loss under zt based csa practices compared to ct based farmers practices are also reported by bhattacharyya et al 2012 gupta et al 2016 and sapkota et al 2015 2017 from the igp region 5 conclusion our results showed that layering of management practices over to farmers practice improved rw system productivity and profitability with less irrigation water and environmental footprints layering of csaps in rw rotation improved system productivity and profitability by 6 and 19 respectively and saved 22 of irrigation water and improved wpi and wpi r by 37 and 26 3 yrs mean respectively compared to farmers practice while reducing 40 global warming potential gwp climate smart agriculture practices were found more adapted to climate risks rather than conventional practices layering of different csa practices

11509,several resource use efficient technologies and practices have been developed and deployed to address the challenges related to natural resource degradation and climatic risks management in rice wheat rw rotation of indo gangetic plains igp however the practices applied in isolation may not be effective as much as in combination due to changing input responses under varied weather abnormalities therefore a multi location farmer s participatory strategic research was conducted to evaluate the effects of layering key technologies practices and services in varied combinations and compared with business as usual farmer s practice for productivity crop water and energy profitability and global warming potential gwp in a rw system altogether six scenarios were compared that includes farmer s practice fp improved fp ifp with low intensity of adaptive measures ifp with high intensity of adaptive measures ifp am climate smart agriculture csa with low intensity of adaptive measures csa l csa with medium intensity of adaptive measures csa m csa with high intensity of adaptive measures csa h results revealed that climate smart agricultural practice with high intensity of adaptive measures csa h recorded 7 9 and 19 26 higher system productivity and profitability respectively compared to farmers practice in all the three years csaps mean of csa l csa m and csa h improved the system productivity and profitability by 6 and 19 3 yrs mean whereas ifps mean of ifp and ifp am by 2 and 5 respectively compared to farmer s practice 11 79 t ha 1 and usd 1833 ha 1 csa with high csa h and medium csa m intensity of adaptive measures saved 17 30 of irrigation water and improved irrigation and total water productivity wpi and wpi r by 29 54 and 21 38 respectively compared to fp in the study years across the years csa h improved the energy use efficiency eue and energy productivity ep by 43 61 and 44 56 respectively compared to farmers practice on 3 years mean

our study revealed that csa with high intensity of adaptive measures csa h increased 8 in system productivity 23 in profitability 31 in total water productivity and 53 in energy productivity with 24 less water while reducing the gwp by 40 the improvement in yield income as well as use efficiency of water and energy and reduction in ghgs was increasing with layering of portfolio of practices on farmers practice this study helps in prioritizing the technological practices from the portfolio of csaps for maximizing crop productivity profitability and input use efficiency while improving the adaptive capacity and reducing the environmental footprints keywords portfolio of management practices systems productivity water productivity economic profitability energy efficiency global warming potential 1 introduction in south asia home to about 1 5 billion people slowdown in the growth rate of cereal production and increasing population pressure have emerged as formidable challenges for the future food and nutritional security these challenges will be more intense under emerging scenarios of natural resource degradation energy crisis volatile markets and risks associated with global climate change jat et al 2016 lal 2016 during 1965 2015 in process of achieving multi fold increase in crop production in the region inefficient use and inappropriate management of non climate production resources water energy agro chemicals have vastly impacted the quality of the natural resources and also increased vulnerability to climatic variability affecting farming adversely the natural resources in south asia especially in indo gangetic plains igp are 3 5 times more stressed due to population economic and political pressures compared to rest of the world jat 2017 this can potentially add to climatic risks and making a large number of people more vulnerable to climatic hazards in the region further in south asia during last one decade the growth rate of the agriculture production is not significantly increased with the population which leads to more risk with no scope for horizontal expansion of farming the future food demand of growing population has to be met mainly through increasing yield per unit area with lesser external inputs labor water and energy while protecting the environment achieving all these under more variable and uncertain climatic condition at present and future is the foremost challenges of present time all across the igp lal 2013 jat et al 2016 campbell et al 2016 having high risks of climate change induced extreme weather events the crop yields in the region are predicted to decrease from 10 to 40 by 2050 with risks of crop failure in several highly vulnerable areas jat 2017 increase variability in both temperature and rainfall patterns changes in water availability shift in growing season rising frequency of extreme events such as terminal heat floods storms droughts sea level rise salinization and perturbations in ecosystems have already affected the livelihood of millions of people rice wheat rw is the most important cropping system for food security in south asia 13 5 mha providing food for more than 400 million people ladha et al 2003 the concerns of natural resource degradation and increased intensity of risks associated with weather variability in the intensively cultivated igp the food bowl of south asia are multiplying the area under the rw system covers 32 and 42 of total rice and wheat area respectively saharawat et al 2012 and is almost static and the productivity and sustainability of the system are threatened because of the inefficiency of current production practices shortage of resources such as water and labour open field burning of crop residues and socioeconomic changes ladha et al 2003 chauhan et al 2012 lohan et al 2018 further climate change on the one hand and changing land use pattern natural resource degradation especially land and water urbanization and increasing pollution on the other hand could affect the ecosystem in this region directly and also indirectly through their impacts on climatic variables lal 2016 for example about 51 of the igp may become unsuitable for wheat crop a major food security crop for india due to increased heat stress by 2050 lobell et al 2012 ortiz et al 2008 similarly water table in north western igp being depleted at 13 17 km3 yr 1 rodell et al 2009 due to over pumping for rice will have serious impacts on rice production therefore adaptation to climate change is no longer an option but a compulsion to minimize the loss due to adverse impacts of climate change and reduce vulnerability ipcc 2014 moreover while maintaining a steady pace of development the region would also need to reduce its environmental footprint from agriculture management practices that provide opportunities to reduce ghgs emission and increasing carbon sequestration is required for resilience in production systems sapkota et al 2014b considering these multiple challenges agricultural technologies that promote sustainable intensification and adapting to emerging climatic variability yet mitigating ghg emissions are scientific

2016 however these csaps in isolation may or may not play their potential role in adapting to climate risks and mitigating ghg emissions in rw production system therefore layering of these practices and services in optimal combinations may help in adapting to climate risks and building resilience to extreme weather and climate variability under diverse production systems and ecologies to ensure future food security to the best of our knowledge there is no systematic research evidence available on layering of different management practices csaps on productivity profitability resource use efficiency under favorable as well as unfavorable climate risk scenarios in most of the production systems rice wheat system of igp being important for food security and challenged by projected climate change consequences we conducted participatory strategic research trials to evaluate the portfolios of agriculture practices csaps under six scenarios to understand what combination of

recorded somewhat intermediate gwp and ghgi on 3 years mean basis csa h recorded lower gwp by 40 and ghgi by 44 compared to fp 7653 kg co2 eq ha 1 yr 1 and 0 64 kg kg 1 co2 eq ha 1 yr 1 fig 2 csaps mean of csa h csa m and csa l lowered gwp and ghgi by 37 and 40 3 yrs mean compared to fp 4 discussion 4 1 crop productivity and profitability the similar rice yield under tpr and dsr was reported by many researchers gathala et al 2011 2014 kamboj et al 2012 jat et al 2014 from the same region with best management practices while some studies reported lower yield under dsr after 2 or 3 years under zt condition kumar et al 2018 sharma et al 2015 our result reconfirms the benefit of dsr in subsequent wheat in rw system as also reported by jat et al 2014 and kumar et al 2018 puddling the field during rice season results in compaction of the field resulting in poor rooting of subsequent wheat crops whereas growing rice without puddling dsr improves the soil physical properties gathala et al 2011 jat et al 2017 and increase soil organic matter choudhary et al 2018b jat et al 2017 sidhu et al 2015 ensuring better germination and root development of subsequent wheat crop aryal et al 2016 better root development and deeper penetration improves the uptake of water and nutrients jat et al 2017 poor performances of winter crops following puddled transplanted rice is also reported by other researchers in the region jat et al 2009 saharawat et al 2010 gathala et al 2011 and have attributed this to deteriorated soil condition compaction and increased bulk density the yield difference between normal and bad years was much higher in fp and the lowest in csa h indicating that the scenario which bundled all possible csa practices offered maximum adaptation to this climatic risk intensive tillage based scenarios showed water stagnation for long period due to untimely rainfall which ultimately turned into lower grain yield but such factors did not influence grain yield under zt scenarios gathala et al 2011 aryal et al 2016 higher rw system productivity with climate smart agriculture practices might be due to improved management practices precise land levelling humphreys et al 2010 efficient cultivar proper tillage and crop establishment gathala et al 2014 jat et al 2014 kumar et al 2018 precise water management choudhary et al 2018a and higher nutrient availability jat et al 2017 higher net returns were associated with csaps followed by ifps due to lower cost of cultivation incurred in tillage crop establishment irrigation cost and higher crop yields tables 7 and 8 avoiding tillage puddling and manual transplanting in rice and adoption of zero till dsr reduced tillage and establishment cost by 79 85 gathala et al 2011 lesser water and labour requirement reduced the input costs to a great extent in dsr erenstein and laxmi 2008 laik et al 2014 saharawat et al 2010 2012 compared to transplanted rice tpr higher crop yields and lower production cost in csaps resulted in to higher profitability of rw system deployment of ca based indicators tillage crop establishment residue nutrient and water management under rice wheat systems in igp resulted in higher net returns gathala et al 2014 jat et al 2014 sharma et al 2015 kumar et al 2018 due to lower production costs and higher crop productivity compared with farmers practice 4 2 water productivity direct seeded rice dsr under csaps csa l csa m and csa h required 20 29 less water than tpr system under fp table 8 which was comparable to the saving reported by nawaz et al 2017 who stated 19 water saving with dsr over tpr in rw system some other researchers mahajana et al 2012 jat et al 2009 choudhary et al 2018a kumar et al 2018 reported 15 50 water saving in dsr compared to tpr across south asia and opined that it can further be increased by using smart water management techniques mishra et al 2013 had also revealed that short term weather forecasts 5 days could reduce average water application by 27 in csaps scenarios avoiding puddling which requires around 3 4 irrigation and keeping crop residues on the soil surface probably minimized development of cracks thereby reducing water loss gathala et al 2014 kamboj et al 2012 kumar et al 2018 residue retention in zt wheat based system reduces the water requirement by conserving soil moisture reducing evaporation loss and minimizing competitions between crop plants and weeds by suppressing weed population erenstein et al 2008 sidhu et al 2015 gathala et al 2014 kumar et al 2018 sharma et al 2015 higher water productivity of zt wheat under csaps than in farmers practice fp was due to elimination of pre sowing irrigation thereby requiring less water coupled with higher grain yield under zt conditions kumar et al 2018 higher water productivity of dsr zt wheat and ca based rw rotation was also recorded by gathala et al 2014 from the same district and they attributed this to better grain yields with less water consumption similarly jat et al 2009 2011 have also reported higher water productivity with 50 less irrigation water under precise laser land levelling compared to traditional land levelling 4 3 energy productivity the higher energy input was associated with tillage labor irrigation and nitrogenous fertilizers in fps compared to csaps srivastava 2003 kumar et al 2013 and aravindakshan et al 2015 reported that intensive tillage before planting required about one third of the total operational energy that could be saved without adversely affecting the yield with zero tillage barut et al 2011 and ladha et al 2015 also found that intensive tillage for crop establishment higher amount of irrigation water higher labour and fertilizer inputs are the major factors for higher energy usage under current production systems laik et al 2014 and gathala et al 2016 confirmed that intensive tillage are the major factors contributing up to 40 higher energy usage than improve agronomic management practices in rw system higher use efficiency and productivity of energy in rice wheat as well as rw system under csa scenarios csa l csa m and csa h was mainly due to lower energy input and higher energy output in these scenarios as compared to fp our results are in close conformity with that of laik et al 2014 ladha et al 2015 parihar et al 2017 2018 and kumar et al 2018 who also reported lower energy input and higher output energy energy use efficiency and energy productivity with improved ca based management practices 4 4 mitigation potential the major sources of emission in our study were production transportation and application of fertilizer residue management and water management in rice the estimated ghg emission from our study are in close conformity with the work reported from india bhatia et al 2005 datta et al 2009 malla et al 2005 as well as global meta analysis by linquist et al 2012 rice ch4 emission was different under different scenarios i e dsr vs tpr this was because although frequency of irrigation was higher in tpr than in dsr both water management system could be broadly categorized as multiple drainage padre et al 2016 through their field measurement in same area reported that switching tpr to zt dsr reduced ch4 emissions by 56 without significant increases in n2o emissions reduction of gwp under csaps was primarily due to the use of neem coated n fertilizer lower nitrogen amount as a result of ssnm techniques and proper residue management reduction of gwp in the rage of 44 47 without any significant yield loss under zt based csa practices compared to ct based farmers practices are also reported by bhattacharyya et al 2012 gupta et al 2016 and sapkota et al 2015 2017 from the igp region 5 conclusion our results showed that layering of management practices over to farmers practice improved rw system productivity and profitability with less irrigation water and environmental footprints layering of csaps in rw rotation improved system productivity and profitability by 6 and 19 respectively and saved 22 of irrigation water and improved wpi and wpi r by 37 and 26 3 yrs mean respectively compared to farmers practice while reducing 40 global warming potential gwp climate smart agriculture practices were found more adapted to climate risks rather than conventional practices layering of different csa practices portfolio offers opportunities to address the issues of crop adaptability with projected climate change in rw rotation for high and stable productivity and profitability while improving the natural
