1100,discharge of untreated wastewater into freshwater ecosystems increases nutrient concentrations causing eutrophication and demanding more intensive monitoring and control activities particularly in developing areas two approaches are commonly used for assessing trophic states of rivers 1 physicochemical trophic state indexes tsis and 2 trophic indexes based on bioindicators mainly periphytic diatoms tdis even when these two approaches seem to be very different they can be complementary under certain circumstances this is the case with río chili arequipa peru a shallow regulated river used for multi purpose activities but which is highly polluted due to the discharge of municipal wastewater the present study assessed the suitability of different tsis and tdis by processing data from historical water quality registers and recent monitoring including periphytic diatom sampling tdis were compared with tsis applied to both recent and historical records results indicated that tsis can be easily obtained from measurements of phosphorus concentrations but they are less sensitive and resulted in a high degree of homogeneity among the classification of trophic conditions along the urban path of the river alternatively tdis showed higher precision and sensitivity reporting detailed classifications of the sampling points tdis suggested that río chili presented conditions that varied from mesotrophic to eutrophic as consequence of wastewater discharges and soil occupation a routine use of tdis with occasional assessment by physicochemical tsis may contribute to water quality sustainability by informing managers of the effects of organic and phosphorus pollution on eutrophication at a lower cost keywords periphytic diatoms water quality río chili trophic pollution trophic state indexes 1 introduction water quality indexes wqis classify levels of pollution based on a set of frequently monitored parameters that describe the general condition of water the use of wqis increases cost efficiency in water management by optimizing the number of parameters frequently monitored and by producing more understandable results a number of important indexes have been proposed for the assessment of general water quality such as brown s wqi 1970 developed by the usa s national sanitation foundation nsf and which has been broadly applied with local adaptations throughout the world including in brazil spain and colombia torres et al 2009 however general water quality indexes give minimal insight into trophic pollution and further there are an abundance of indexes for assessing eutrophication in lakes while there are few such indexes for classifying streams and rivers and so their use in these ecosystems is rare dodds et al 1998 in the last few decades several trophic state indexes tsis have been proposed specifically for freshwater streams which are usually based on one of two different approaches 1 physicochemical based tsis and 2 indexes based on bioindicator organisms such as diatoms tdis and benthic species psychochemical indexes have been more commonly applied in the usa and latin america especially for deep and slow flowing rivers in which structuring of a benthic community is not possible lamparelli 2004 bioindicator indexes on the other hand have been used in the evaluation of shallow and steeply sloped rivers where hydrodynamic conditions allow the formation of a benthic community this approach has been broadly used in europe even though important studies have considered diatom indexes in the usa and other countries ponader et al 2007 potapova and charles 2007 diatom assemblages in rivers are a component of periphyton which comprises a complex microbial community that is attached to organic or inorganic substrates on submerged surfaces wetzel 1983 since periphyton structure at any given location is governed by local water quality its assessment can be useful for characterizing environmental conditions rice et al 2012 and evaluating spatial and temporal changes diatom periphyton also respond quickly to increased nutrient loading and thus are useful for detecting changes on small spatial or temporal scales such as the effects of sewage discharge jüttner et al 2010 some indexes that are based on the identification and quantification of diatom assemblages tdis are strongly correlated with the physicochemical parameters of the water peszek et al 2015 the most commonly used tdi is kelly s trophic diatom index first developed by kelly and whitton 1995 for correlating diatom ecology with trophic state based on one hundred diatom taxa kelly s tdi produces numerical values varying from 1 indicating low nutrient concentrations to 5 indicating high nutrient concentrations another widely used index is rott s tdi 1999 which was developed for streams in austria both indexes are included as part of various software packages such as omnidia local adaptations of such indexes might be required depending on the particular environmental factors involved and their local variability besse lototskaya et al 2011 the development of regional autoecological indexes has been a common practice in many countries such as in the netherlands van dam et al 1994 germany coring 1999 spain delgado et al 2012 and usa stancheva et al 2012 there are fewer tsis based on physicochemical assessment than there are tdis based on phosphorus nitrogen and chlorophyll concentrations dodds et al 1998 proposed boundaries for trophic states of rivers and streams have been widely used especially in the usa and include upper boundaries for p of 25μg l for oligotrophic mesotrophic systems and of 75μg l for mesotrophic eutrophic systems an index developed for temperate regions carlson s tsi was adapted by toledo et al 1983 and lamparelli 2004 for the evaluation of tropical streams in brazil and which are currently widely used fernandes cunha et al 2008 fia et al 2009 farage et al 2010 physicochemical and diatom indexes require specific approaches with local statistical adaptations and both possess advantages and disadvantages trophic indexes based on physicochemical variables are powerful tools for the assessment of eutrophication by directly measuring changes in nutrient concentrations in water however they can be very dependent on the water quality at a specific point in time and give only short term insights into the real ecological status of an ecosystem another disadvantage of physicochemical based trophic indexes is their requirement for constant and expensive monitoring which could limit their use by stakeholders in developing countries however tdis require diatom identification which often depends on sophisticated taxonomic skills that are not commonly available dodds et al 1998 nonetheless samples can be easily obtained and preserved and since a microscope is the only equipment required for analysis the acquisition of results is likely to be less expensive than physicochemical analyses additionally tdis can accurately assess the ecological status of an ecosystem since diatom assemblages are less affected by momentary or short term variation in physicochemical variables river basins in the andean region of southern peru are characterized by possessing water holding systems that include series of reservoirs affected by anthropogenic activities that promote eutrophication the río chili basin arequipa peru provides drinking water in the city of arequipa but experiences the occurrence of cyanotoxins and other effects of trophic pollution and cyanobacteria blooms digesa 2014 río chili is a shallow steeply sloped river subjected to variation in water quality due to intermittent wastewater discharge and variation in flow rate due to regulation consequently conditions favorable to the formation of periphyton are expected to predominate in the river making tdis a useful tool for assessing trophic states the present study assessed and compared the suitability of both physicochemical based tsis and tdis in order to verify their applicability for describing freshwater ecosystems of andean highlands basins and providing more precise information to water managers the main hypothesis tested was that tdis can produce a more accurate classification than tsis since periphytic diatoms are less dependent to instantaneous variations of physicochemical measurements and they could summarize information in relation to several water quality variables beyond merely nutrients concentrations for this purpose historical water quality data were used to establish the general water quality status along the urban path of the river and to estimate toledo s lamparelli s and dodds tsis based on orthophosphate po4 p and total phosphorus total p concentrations additionally diatoms were sampled and identified during the austral winter and spring of 2015 accompanied by a basic monitoring of physicochemical parameters than can be easily repeated given the capacities of local management preliminary relationships were established between the structure and dynamics of periphytic diatoms and water quality kelly s and rott s tdis were estimated and compared with the physicochemical based tsis using both historical and recent data 2 materials and methods the city of arequipa is located in the andean cordillera of the southwestern peru 16 23 0 s 71 32 0 w at a mean elevation of 2300m the río chili basin is a subunit of the quilca chili system with a catchment area of 6758 56km2 and mean temperatures between 14 6 c winter and 17 7 c summer the rainy season occurs between december and march with historical averages ranging 63 173mm during drought years precipitation can be less than 45mm humidity ranges between 30 and 70 with higher values corresponding to the rainy season the uv index is very high with maximums of u v 13 during october and november crhcqch 2013 río chili originates upstream of arequipa s urban area and just downstream of the outlet of the aguadablanca reservoir at 3600m a s l the main uses of río chili include providing water to the urban area of arequipa and for economic activities such as irrigation and mining and manufacturing industries throughout its course through arequipa s urban area río chili becomes a primary component of the historical downtown urban landscape at the end of its urban path río chili receives the río tingo which is also polluted with municipal wastewater and carries the majority of untreated wastewater discharge from arequipa s sewage system some kilometers downstream río chili supplies water for irrigation of crops in the la joya district the local water authority has established eight sampling points for water quality monitoring along the urban path of río chili the first three sampling points are located upstream of the city and downstream of the outlet of the aguadablanca reservoir which regulates the flow rates of río chili the points 132chil4 to 132chil6 are located within the urban perimeter while 132chil7 and 132chil8 are located downstream of it fig 1 shows the general location of the study area including the sampling points established by the local water authority to evaluate the general trophic pollution gradient along the urban stretch of río chili available historical records of water quality were assessed including water temperature t flow rate q dissolved oxygen do biochemical oxygen demand bod5 nitrate no3 n total nitrogen total p orthophosphates po4 p total phosphorus total p conductivity cond boron b aluminum al iron fe and main cations including calcium ca magnesium mg sodium na and potassium k all parameters were assessed by the local water authority following standard methods rice et al 2012 the dataset used corresponded to 12 samplings days carried out from 2011 to 2015 with a sampling frequency of 2 4 times per year 2 1 monitoring period diatom samples were collected during august to december of 2015 at the sampling points 132chil2 16 19 38 67 71 31 52 77 132chil4 16 23 14 22 71 32 14 22 and 132chil6 16 27 07 11 71 35 41 61 for being representative of the main trophic states of the gradient produced by the urban area of arequipa point 132chil2 is located upstream of the urban area 132chil4 is located after a few kilometers of passage within the city and 132chil6 is located downstream of the urban area anthropogenic activities are present both upstream and downstream of the aguadablanca reservoir sources of pollutants upstream of the aguadablanca reservoir include trout aquaculture in upstream reservoirs and agriculture and livestock whereas downstream and upstream of 132chil2 mainly hydroelectric infrastructure is present several water intakes are present between 132chil2 and 132chil4 including the main derivation channel for the supply of drinking water and for agriculture some minor amounts of wastewater are also discharged in the river along this stretch between 132chil4 and 132chil5 the río chili receives the río tingo and the main sewage line from arequipa which discharges 1m3 s of untreated municipal wastewater institutional and agricultural uses of land predominate between 132chil2 and 132chil4 whereas agricultural land uses predominate near 132chil6 at each sampling point three diatom samples were obtained from three different rocks retrieved from the riverbed 15 30cm below the water surface diatoms samples were fixed in loco according to apha 10300 rice et al 2012 by brushing periphyton off of a measured 5 cm2 area and rinsing it with formalin 6 until obtaining a sample of approximately 100ml in the laboratory samples were centrifuged 1500rpm and the precipitated solids containing diatoms were treated with h2o2 30 and heated 200 c until solids obtained a gray appearance to digest organic matter which was later washed with distilled water and centrifuged again zrax high refractive index mounting media was used to fix samples for microscopic observation diatom species were identified using the taxonomic references of krammer and lange bertalot 1986 1988 relative abundances of each species were calculated by counting up to 400 individuals of the dominant species of each sample a 1l water sample was also taken at each sampling point for the analyses of ph phmeter oakton test30 turbidity turbidimeter lutron tu 2016 no3 n apha 4500 no3 b and total p apha 4500 p e 2 2 assessment of physicochemical based trophic state indexes to assess the trophic states at each sampling point along the urban stretch of río chili tsil tsit and dodds indexes were determined from total p and po4 p concentrations and classified according to the range of trophic states with boundaries defined by the minimum and maximum values lamparelli s and toledo s trophic indexes tsil and tdit for po4 p and total p μg l were estimated using eqs 1 2a and 2b respectively results were classified by trophic state according to boundaries reported in lamparelli 2004 toledo et al 1983 and

shannon s diversity index h were determined for each sampling point using past software based on the zelinka and marwan 1961 formula the trophic diatom index of kelly et al 2001 was estimated on the basis of relative abundances of species and nutrient sensitivity s and indicator values v reported by kelly et al 2001 and the freshwaterecology database of schmidt kloiber and hering 2015 likewise rott s index was estimated in the same manner using the freshwaterecology database of schmidt kloiber and hering 2015 values of s and v were acquired from the database while those with missing values were taken from kelly et al 2001 kelly s and rott s tdis have been found to be widely relevant in the evaluation of diatom metrics in europe besse lototskaya et al 2011 and their combined use could offer a balanced species level assessment 2 4 data analysis statistical analyses were run in past software hammer et al 2001 descriptive statistics and parametric anovas were used to investigate the occurrence of significant differences between sampling points in physicochemical parameters diatom relative abundancies and trophic indexes assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity were checked using shapiro wilk and levene tests respectively when the assumptions were not met data were log10 x 1 transformed and normality and homoscedasticity tested again when the anova was significant a tukey s test was employed to determine the differences if transformed data were not normal and homoscedastic non parametric kruskall wallis and dunn s post hoc tests were used to evaluate the occurrence of significant differences between sampling points the main variables found to be responsible for describing variability within the historical physicochemical data were identified and selected for further statistical analyses including principal component pca and spearman s correlation analyses the pca was applied to log10 transformed data in order to investigate the relationships among the main variables responsible for defining the trophic state of each sampling point for historical water quality records finally canonical correspondence analysis cca were used to explore cause effect relationships between the main diatom species and the physicochemical parameters measured during the monitoring period of 2015 spearman s correlations were applied to log transformed data in order to establish the level of correspondence between selected environmental variables 3 results 3 1 historical water quality data table 1 provides the main parameters of water quality from

were the most important for describing the effects of the municipal wastewater discharges and the urban area of arequipa fig 2 the scores and classifications of trophic states obtained for each sampling point are presented in table 2 the indexes tsil and tsit total p classified all sampling points as hypertrophic or mesotrophic to hypertrophic or eutrophic to hypertrophic respectively the tsit po4 p index classified almost all points as eutrophic to hypertrophic dodds index which is directly related to the concentration of total p in μg l suggested conditions from mesotrophic to eutrophic and eutrophic among all sampling points 3 2 physicochemical monitoring and trophic index estimation the monitoring period experienced no rainfall and the temperatures ranged from 9 3 to 23 c

records scores for the trophic indexes exhibited a tendency for a longitudinal increase but the resulting classifications of trophic states were the same for the three sampling points eutrophic for tsit and dodds s tsi and hypertrophic for tsil 3 3 diatom identification and metrics diatom assemblages collected from the three sampling points during the monitoring of 2015 possessed a total of 42 different species the genera nitzschia navicula and achnanthes possessed 12 4 and 3 species respectively other genera identified were diatoma gomphonema fragilaria and planothidium one species was identified for eolimna coocconeis rhoicosphenia gomphoneis asterionella encyonema cyclotella reimeria mellosira surirella synedra epithemia and cymbella major significance was given to variation in ecological indicator species which were also the most dominant species each sampling point possessed different dominances of ecological indicator species fig 3 at 132chil2 nitzschia inconspicua was predominant during the winter while cocconeis placentula dominated during spring at 132chil4 navicula lanceolate and nitzschia inconspicua were the most abundant during spring while cocconeis plancentula dominated during winter at 132chil6 eolimna subminuscula nitzschia sp1 nitzschia sp2 and n capitellata dominated throughout the entire sampling period with no seasonal variation while other species exhibited an inferior presence the cca fig 4 showed that the occurrence of nitzschia sp2 eolimna subminuscula and nitzschia sp1 were likely correlated with high values of total p spearman r s 0 49 0 63 and 0 85 respectively p 0 05 eolimna subminuscula and nitzchia sp1 were also highly correlated with high concentrations of nitrate r s 0 55 0 73 p 0 05 and turbidity r s 0 52 0 76 p 0 05 whereas all the other species seemed to have higher abundancies in less polluted environments with slightly higher ph such as those found at 132chil2 in fact navicula lanceolata nitzschia inconspicua nitzschia dissipata and others were strongly correlated with low values of total p r s 0 58 0 72 0 61 0 62 respectively p 0 05 and nitrate r s 0 64 0 58 0 69 0 68 respectively p 0 05 and

kelly s scores were not significantly correlated with any physicochemical variable additionally the percentage of motile species was also assessed but no significant differences were found in global results f 2 47 p 0 05 but there was a tendency for higher percentages at 132chil6 4 discussion historical data provided information of water quality and trophic gradients in the urban stretch of rio chili despite missing data and irregular frequencies of samplings a general situation of deteriorated trophic states even upstream of the urban area of arequipa 132chil1 and 132chil2 was demonstrated through total p concentrations from both historical and recent records which exceeded the peruvian water quality standard of 0 15mg l minam 2015 in fact this river is formed by the outlet of aguadablanca reservoir which had previously been reported as a hypertrophic system with mean total p concentrations of 0 12mg l crhcqch 2013 thus the present study documented that the sampling points located upstream the urban area of arequipa 132chil1 to 132chil3 are already suffering the effects of anthropogenic influences occurring in the watershed such as trout aquaculture agriculture and livestock the situation downstream of the urban area is even more critical since both historical data and recent sampling revealed longitudinal increases of pollution resulting from municipal wastewater discharge historical data also provided information about main cations ca na k mg and conductivity which showed to have an influence over the general behavior of water quality in the urban stretch of the river since significant longitudinal increases were detected this may be related with soil laundering during rainy seasons mainly by the natural short vegetal covering predominating in the watershed mohammed et al 2017 however conductivity and cations concentrations ranged below limits of peruvian water quality standard minam 2015 and no significant ecological effects are expected since concentrations were relatively low when compared with values influencing diatoms ecology mangadze et al 2017 conversely al and fe presented some concentrations exceeding local standards but they seem to have no importance as was suggested by the pca fig 2 total p showed a more significant influence and exhibited a major importance in characterizing the ecological condition of the río chili with nitrogen and other physicochemical variables related to carbon and nutrients pollution playing a secondary role as it has been described for other hyper eutrophic aquatic environments giani et al 2005 figueredo et al 2016a the increasing total p concentrations along the river are probably a consequence of wastewater discharge and the expansion of the urban area of arequipa crhcqch 2013 since human activities often result in a large addition of p to waterbodies carpenter et al 1998 high concentrations of phosphorus in water may increase the rates of primary production and decomposition which causes a depletion of dissolved oxygen correll 1998 these tendencies were reinforced by our data since bod5 was also an important variable for characterizing the system and was strongly related to total p and po4 p concentrations furthermore do depletion in río chili was probably intensified by increasing temperature from upstream to downstream which decreases gas solubility in water and increases metabolic rates cox 2003 dodds and tsit total p indexes were useful in describing changes in water quality along the course of río chili their scores demonstrated a longitudinal gradient of eutrophication with a maximum pollution level occurring at 132chil6 according to both historical and recent data the high degree of homogeneity among the classifications of the samples by tsil and tsit po4 p indicates that these indexes were less sensitive at detecting spatial temporal variation and thus were not suitable for evaluating the effects of human actions in the region the low sensitivity of tsit po4 p could be expected since po4 p has less influence in driving eutrophication than total p as shown by previous researchers correll 1998 figueredo et al 2014 2016b on the other hand the wide variations of tsil and tsit po4 p suggest the need of local adaptation of these indexes that would improve their sensitivity for describing the environmental gradient in this andean stream the monitoring period of 2015 experienced temperatures typical of peruvian summer and spring with mild values due to elevation and small seasonal variation dodds and tsit total p indexes were applied to evaluating the data collected from the monitoring period of 2015 and classified 132chil2 132chil4 and 132chil6 as eutrophic this increase in trophic levels compared to historical records especially for 132chil2 and 132chil4 may be due to lower flow rates of the discharge from agua blanca which decreases the dilution of pollutants discharged along the entire course of the river diatom species identified in río chili were indicative of trophic pollution at 132chil2 and 132chil4 there was a dominance of navicula lanceolata and cocconeis placentula which are indicative of moderate levels of organic pollution kelly et al 2001 these species altered dominance between winter and spring probably due to increases in temperatures creating unfavorable conditions for navicula lanceolata which is well adapted to cold waters spaulding et al 2010 additionally organic pollution at these two points does not appear to have reached an extreme level because non resistant species like achnanthes minutissima and encyonema minutum kelly et al 2001 oliva martin et al 2005 ponader et al 2007 were detected the higher abundances of nitzschia inconspicua observed when higher total p concentrations were recorded can be explained by its known resistance to p pollution kelly et al 2001 2015 eolimna subminuscula was previously identified as tolerant to organic pollution related to domestic and industrial discharges salomoni et al 2006 and tolerant to eutrophic conditions with low do concentrations van dam et al 1994 these attributes probably explain the dominance of this species at 132chil6 which possessed high concentrations of organic matter and high levels of trophic pollution the summary of the community results suggests that the above mentioned species could be used as indicators of water quality for río chili the cca analysis fig 4 illustrated the relationships between indicator species and the organic and trophic pollution levels detected at each sampling point the relationship of nitzschia lanceolata and nitzschia inconspicua with mid to low conditions of turbidity and total p at 132chil2 and 132chil4 was confirmed whereas e subminuscula and nitzschia sp1 were related to high levels of organic and trophic pollution at 132chil6 the shannon index h indicated greater diversity at 132chil2 and 132chil4 when compared to 132chil6 where higher loads of organic pollutants resulted in decreased diatom biodiversity because of losses of species that were non resistant to pollution this result has been commonly observed in streams exposed to pollution jüttner et al 2010 moresco and rodrigues 2014 kelly s and rott s indexes reinforced the evidence of increasing eutrophication from upstream to downstream these indexes classified 132chil2 132chi4 and 132chil6 as meso eutrophic to eu hypertrophic and 132chil6 as eu hypertrophic since none of the species with more than 1 of relative abundancy were previously reported as unreliable for trophic classification based on kelly s or rott s tdi besse lototskaya et al 2011 these indexes are expected to be a good fit to the dynamics of diatom assemblages in río chili rott s index was more closely correlated with total p than kelly s tdi indicating a higher specificity for assessing trophic states in río chili kelly s tdi is highly influenced by organic pollution which causes an increase in abundance of motile species thus this index gives an important insight into the contribution of organic pollution to eutrophication kelly 1997 but is less specific in detecting longitudinal phosphorus increases however the combined application of both indexes in the urban stretch of río chili suggests that increases in eutrophication and p concentrations were associated with organic pollution occurring from upstream to downstream as previously evidenced by the significant positive correlation between bod5 and total p results from diatom ecological indicators and tdis corresponded more closely to the trophic state classifications of tsis applied to historical records than to the classifications of the results of tsis for 2015 probably due to the lesser dependence of tdis on momentary short term water quality variation such as those caused by increases or decreases in flow lower flow rates discharged from aguadablanca reservoir during 2015 may have caused momentary increases in total p concentrations that do not necessarily have an ecological impact limitations of physicochemical tsis have been reported in terms of producing estimations dependent on water quality at the time of sampling and which may not correspond to the real ecological status of the system padisák 1993 and so they should always be analyzed and interpreted as part of a set of water physicochemical and ecological indicators furthermore since significant correlations were found between rott s tdi and total p nitrate and turbidity this index seemed to be able of summarizing information in relation to several water quality variables beyond merely nutrients concentrations results obtained in the present study also suggest that diatom indexes can be successfully applied in high andean environments especially in streams with similar characteristics to chili river i e altitude ranging up to 3000m a s l slopes up to 10 and water temperatures around 10 25 c thus our results reinforce previous reports indicating the suitability of diatom indexes in assessing eutrophication in streams of the southern hemisphere bellinger et al 2006 moresco and rodriguez 2014 although local investigations into the sensitivity of diatoms and the need for adaptations to the classification boundaries of trophic states are always required finally a sustainable monitoring program for trophic pollution in río chili and similar andean basins polluted with municipal wastewater may include a routine monitoring of diatom assemblages complemented with sporadic evaluation of tsis the sampling and preservation of samples for physicochemical analyses are often more complex and expensive using tdis implies a lower cost and greater flexibility for water authorities in assessing water quality and making quick decisions given that trained taxonomists are locally available the tsis may only need to be assessed a few times a year for detecting variation in physicochemical water quality a monitoring program with these characteristics will allow gathering more and more frequent information without considerable additional costs 5 conclusions diatom species were good indicators of trophic pollution in the río chili nitzschia sp2 eolimna subminuscula and nitzschia sp1 were correlated with high values of total p whereas navicula lanceolata nitzschia inconspicua nitzschia dissipata were highly correlated with low to moderate concentrations of total p which was identified as the master variable driving trophic states dodds index tsit total p and rott s and kelly s tdis performed well in describing the trophic levels of río chili and proved to be suitable for evaluating ecological impacts derived from the anthropogenic effects of the urban area of arequipa these indexes also coincided in detecting a longitudinal increase in trophic levels caused by discharge of municipal wastewater and urban occupation in río chili tsit total p and dodds index should always be employed as part of water quality assessment in order to prevent estimations dependent entirely on momentary conditions periodical evaluation of tsis may help in controlling general physicochemical water quality whereas tdis are more suitable for frequent monitoring rott s index may be used for trophic state assessments whereas kelly s tdi is valuable for its generalist approach when applied together with rott s index kelly s tdi was also important in indicating the contribution of organic pollution to eutrophication a sustainable monitoring program for trophic pollution in high andean basins and shallow rivers in general such as río chili should be based on routine assessments of trophic assemblages complemented with monitoring of physicochemical parameters conflict of interest none declared

1100,discharge of untreated wastewater into freshwater ecosystems increases nutrient concentrations causing eutrophication and demanding more intensive monitoring and control activities particularly in developing areas two approaches are commonly used for assessing trophic states of rivers 1 physicochemical trophic state indexes tsis and 2 trophic indexes based on bioindicators mainly periphytic diatoms tdis even when these two approaches seem to be very different they can be complementary under certain circumstances this is the case with río chili arequipa peru a shallow regulated river used for multi purpose activities but which is highly polluted due to the discharge of municipal wastewater the present study assessed the suitability of different tsis and tdis by processing data from historical water quality registers and recent monitoring including periphytic diatom sampling tdis were compared with tsis applied to both recent and historical records results indicated that tsis can be easily obtained from measurements of phosphorus concentrations but they are less sensitive and resulted in a high degree of homogeneity among the classification of trophic conditions along the urban path of the river alternatively tdis showed higher precision and sensitivity reporting detailed classifications of the sampling points tdis suggested that río chili presented conditions that varied from mesotrophic to eutrophic as consequence of wastewater discharges and soil occupation a routine use of tdis with occasional assessment by physicochemical tsis may contribute to water quality sustainability by informing managers of the effects of organic and phosphorus pollution on eutrophication at a lower cost keywords periphytic diatoms water quality río chili trophic pollution trophic state indexes 1 introduction water quality indexes wqis classify levels of pollution based on a set of frequently monitored parameters that describe the general condition of water the use of wqis increases cost efficiency in water management by optimizing the number of parameters frequently monitored and by producing more understandable results a number of important indexes have been proposed for the assessment of general water quality such as brown s wqi 1970 developed by the usa s national sanitation foundation nsf and which has been broadly applied with local adaptations throughout the world including in brazil spain and colombia torres et al 2009 however general water quality indexes give minimal insight into trophic pollution and further there are an abundance of indexes for assessing eutrophication in lakes while there are few such indexes for classifying streams and rivers and so their use in these ecosystems is rare dodds et al 1998 in the last few decades several trophic state indexes tsis have been proposed specifically for freshwater streams which are usually based on one of two different approaches 1 physicochemical based tsis and 2 indexes based on bioindicator organisms such as diatoms tdis and benthic species psychochemical indexes have been more commonly applied in the usa and latin america especially for deep and slow flowing rivers in which structuring of a benthic community is not possible lamparelli 2004 bioindicator indexes on the other hand have been used in the evaluation of shallow and steeply sloped rivers where hydrodynamic conditions allow the formation of a benthic community this approach has been broadly used in europe even though important studies have considered diatom indexes in the usa and other countries ponader et al 2007 potapova and charles 2007 diatom assemblages in rivers are a component of periphyton which comprises a complex microbial community that is attached to organic or inorganic substrates on submerged surfaces wetzel 1983 since periphyton structure at any given location is governed by local water quality its assessment can be useful for characterizing environmental conditions rice et al 2012 and evaluating spatial and temporal changes diatom periphyton also respond quickly to increased nutrient loading and thus are useful for detecting changes on small spatial or temporal scales such as the effects of sewage discharge jüttner et al 2010 some indexes that are based on the identification and quantification of diatom assemblages tdis are strongly correlated with the physicochemical parameters of the water peszek et al 2015 the most commonly used tdi is kelly s trophic diatom index first developed by kelly and whitton 1995 for correlating diatom ecology with trophic state based on one hundred diatom taxa kelly s tdi produces numerical values varying from 1 indicating low nutrient concentrations to 5 indicating high nutrient concentrations another widely used index is rott s tdi 1999 which was developed for streams in austria both indexes are included as part of various software packages such as omnidia local adaptations of such indexes might be required depending on the particular environmental factors involved and their local variability besse lototskaya et al 2011 the development of regional autoecological indexes has been a common practice in many countries such as in the netherlands van dam et al 1994 germany coring 1999 spain delgado et al 2012 and usa stancheva et al 2012 there are fewer tsis based on physicochemical assessment than there are tdis based on phosphorus nitrogen and chlorophyll concentrations dodds et al 1998 proposed boundaries for trophic states of rivers and streams have been widely used especially in the usa and include upper boundaries for p of 25μg l for oligotrophic mesotrophic systems and of 75μg l for mesotrophic eutrophic systems an index developed for temperate regions carlson s tsi was adapted by toledo et al 1983 and lamparelli 2004 for the evaluation of tropical streams in brazil and which are currently widely used fernandes cunha et al 2008 fia et al 2009 farage et al 2010 physicochemical and diatom indexes require specific approaches with local statistical adaptations and both possess advantages and disadvantages trophic indexes based on physicochemical variables are powerful tools for the assessment of eutrophication by directly measuring changes in nutrient concentrations in water however they can be very dependent on the water quality at a specific point in time and give only short term insights into the real ecological status of an ecosystem another disadvantage of physicochemical based trophic indexes is their requirement for constant and expensive monitoring which could limit their use by stakeholders in developing countries however tdis require diatom identification which often depends on sophisticated taxonomic skills that are not commonly available dodds et al 1998 nonetheless samples can be easily obtained and preserved and since a microscope is the only equipment required for analysis the acquisition of results is likely to be less expensive than physicochemical analyses additionally tdis can accurately assess the ecological status of an ecosystem since diatom assemblages are less affected by momentary or short term variation in physicochemical variables river basins in the andean region of southern peru are characterized by possessing water holding systems that include series of reservoirs affected by anthropogenic activities that promote eutrophication the río chili basin arequipa peru provides drinking water in the city of arequipa but experiences the occurrence of cyanotoxins and other effects of trophic pollution and cyanobacteria blooms digesa 2014 río chili is a shallow steeply sloped river subjected to variation in water quality due to intermittent wastewater discharge and variation in flow rate due to regulation consequently conditions favorable to the formation of periphyton are expected to predominate in the river making tdis a useful tool for assessing trophic states the present study assessed and compared the suitability of both physicochemical based tsis and tdis in order to verify their applicability for describing freshwater ecosystems of andean highlands basins and providing more precise information to water managers the main hypothesis tested was that tdis can produce a more accurate classification than tsis since periphytic diatoms are less dependent to instantaneous variations of physicochemical measurements and they could summarize information in relation to several water quality variables beyond merely nutrients concentrations for this purpose historical water quality data were used to establish the general water quality status along the urban path of the river and to estimate toledo s lamparelli s and dodds tsis based on orthophosphate po4 p and total phosphorus total p concentrations additionally diatoms were sampled and identified during the austral winter and spring of 2015 accompanied by a basic monitoring of physicochemical parameters than can be easily repeated given the capacities of local management preliminary relationships were established between the structure and dynamics of periphytic diatoms and water quality kelly s and rott s tdis were estimated and compared with the physicochemical based tsis using both historical and recent data 2 materials and methods the city of arequipa is located in the andean cordillera of the southwestern peru 16 23 0 s 71 32 0 w at a mean elevation of 2300m the río chili basin is a subunit of the quilca chili system with a catchment area of 6758 56km2 and mean temperatures between 14 6 c winter and 17 7 c summer the rainy season occurs between december and march with historical averages ranging 63 173mm during drought years precipitation can be less than 45mm humidity ranges between 30 and 70 with higher values corresponding to the rainy season the uv index is very high with maximums of u v 13 during october and november crhcqch 2013 río chili originates upstream of arequipa s urban area and just downstream of the outlet of the aguadablanca reservoir at 3600m a s l the main uses of río chili include providing water to the urban area of arequipa and for economic activities such as irrigation and mining and manufacturing industries throughout its course through arequipa s urban area río chili becomes a primary component of the historical downtown urban landscape at the end of its urban path río chili receives the río tingo which is also polluted with municipal wastewater and carries the majority of untreated wastewater discharge from arequipa s sewage system some kilometers downstream río chili supplies water for irrigation of crops in the la joya district the local water authority has established eight sampling points for water quality monitoring along the urban path of río chili the first three sampling points are located upstream of the city and downstream of the outlet of the aguadablanca reservoir which regulates the flow rates of río chili the points 132chil4 to 132chil6 are located within the urban perimeter while 132chil7 and 132chil8 are located downstream of it fig 1 shows the general location of the study area including the sampling points established by the local water authority to evaluate the general trophic pollution gradient along the urban stretch of río chili available historical records of water quality were assessed including water temperature t flow rate q dissolved

calcium ca magnesium mg sodium na and potassium k all parameters were assessed by the local water authority following standard methods rice et al 2012 the dataset used corresponded to 12 samplings days carried out from 2011 to 2015 with a sampling frequency of 2 4 times per year 2 1 monitoring period diatom samples were collected during august to december of 2015 at the sampling points 132chil2

point 132chil2 is located upstream of the urban area 132chil4 is located after a few kilometers of passage within the city and 132chil6 is located downstream of the urban area anthropogenic activities are present both upstream and downstream of the aguadablanca reservoir sources of pollutants upstream of the aguadablanca reservoir include trout aquaculture in upstream reservoirs and agriculture and livestock whereas downstream and upstream of 132chil2 mainly hydroelectric infrastructure is present several water intakes are present between 132chil2 and 132chil4 including the main derivation channel for the supply of drinking water and for agriculture some minor amounts of wastewater are also discharged in the river along this stretch between 132chil4 and 132chil5 the río chili receives the río tingo and the main sewage line from arequipa which discharges 1m3 s of untreated municipal wastewater institutional and agricultural uses of land predominate between 132chil2 and 132chil4 whereas agricultural land uses predominate near 132chil6 at each sampling point three diatom samples were obtained from three different rocks retrieved from the riverbed 15 30cm below the water surface diatoms samples were fixed in loco according to apha 10300 rice et al 2012 by brushing periphyton off of a measured 5 cm2 area and rinsing it with formalin 6 until obtaining a sample of approximately 100ml in the laboratory samples were centrifuged 1500rpm and the precipitated solids containing diatoms were treated with h2o2 30 and heated 200 c until solids obtained a gray appearance to digest organic matter which was later washed with distilled water and centrifuged again zrax high refractive index mounting media was used to fix samples for microscopic observation diatom species were identified using the taxonomic references of krammer and lange bertalot 1986 1988 relative abundances of each species were calculated by counting up to 400 individuals of the dominant species of each sample a 1l water sample was also taken at each sampling point for the analyses of ph phmeter oakton test30 turbidity turbidimeter lutron tu 2016 no3 n apha 4500 no3 b and total p apha 4500 p e 2 2 assessment of physicochemical based trophic state indexes to assess the trophic states at each sampling point along the urban stretch of río chili tsil tsit and dodds indexes were determined from total p and po4 p concentrations and classified according to the range of trophic states with boundaries defined by the minimum and maximum values lamparelli s and toledo s trophic indexes tsil and tdit for po4 p and total p μg l were estimated using eqs 1 2a and 2b respectively results were classified by trophic state according to boundaries reported in lamparelli 2004 toledo et al 1983 and

shannon s diversity index h were determined for each sampling point using past software based on the zelinka and marwan 1961 formula the trophic diatom index of kelly et al 2001 was estimated on the basis of relative abundances of species and nutrient sensitivity s and indicator values v reported by kelly et al 2001 and the freshwaterecology database of schmidt kloiber and hering 2015 likewise rott s index was estimated in the same manner using the freshwaterecology database of schmidt kloiber and hering 2015 values of s and v were acquired from the database while those with missing values were taken from kelly et al 2001 kelly s and rott s tdis have been found to be widely relevant in the evaluation of diatom metrics in europe besse lototskaya et al 2011 and their combined use could offer a balanced species level assessment 2 4 data analysis statistical analyses were run in past software hammer et al 2001 descriptive statistics and parametric anovas were used to investigate the occurrence of significant differences between sampling points in physicochemical parameters diatom relative abundancies and trophic indexes assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity were checked using shapiro wilk and levene tests respectively when the assumptions were not met data were log10 x 1 transformed and normality and homoscedasticity tested again when the anova was significant a tukey s test was employed to determine the differences if transformed data were not normal and homoscedastic non parametric kruskall wallis and dunn s post hoc tests were used to evaluate the occurrence of significant differences between sampling points the main variables found to be responsible for describing variability within the historical physicochemical data were identified and selected for further statistical analyses including principal component pca and spearman s correlation analyses the pca was applied to log10 transformed data in order to investigate the relationships among the main variables responsible for defining the trophic state of each sampling point for historical water quality records finally canonical correspondence analysis cca were used to explore cause effect relationships between the main diatom species and the physicochemical parameters measured during the monitoring period of 2015 spearman s correlations were applied to log transformed data in order to establish the level of correspondence between selected environmental variables 3 results 3 1 historical water quality data table 1 provides the main parameters of water quality from

tsit po4 p index classified almost all points as eutrophic to hypertrophic dodds index which is directly related to the concentration of total p in μg l suggested conditions from mesotrophic to eutrophic and eutrophic among all sampling points 3 2 physicochemical monitoring and trophic index estimation the monitoring period experienced no rainfall and the temperatures ranged from 9 3 to 23 c

records scores for the trophic indexes exhibited a tendency for a longitudinal increase but the resulting classifications of trophic states were the same for the three sampling points eutrophic for tsit and dodds s tsi and hypertrophic for tsil 3 3 diatom identification and metrics diatom assemblages collected from the three sampling points during the monitoring of 2015 possessed a total of 42 different species the genera nitzschia navicula and achnanthes possessed 12 4 and 3 species respectively other genera identified were diatoma gomphonema fragilaria and planothidium one species was identified for eolimna coocconeis rhoicosphenia gomphoneis asterionella encyonema cyclotella reimeria mellosira surirella synedra epithemia and cymbella major significance was given to variation in ecological indicator species which were also the most dominant species each sampling point possessed different dominances of ecological indicator species fig 3 at 132chil2 nitzschia inconspicua was predominant during the winter while cocconeis placentula dominated during spring at 132chil4 navicula lanceolate and nitzschia inconspicua were the most abundant during spring while cocconeis plancentula dominated during winter at 132chil6 eolimna subminuscula nitzschia sp1 nitzschia sp2 and n capitellata dominated throughout the entire sampling period with no seasonal variation while other species exhibited an inferior presence the cca fig 4 showed that the occurrence of nitzschia sp2 eolimna subminuscula and nitzschia sp1 were likely correlated with high values of total p spearman r s 0 49 0 63 and 0 85 respectively p 0 05 eolimna subminuscula and nitzchia sp1 were also highly correlated with high concentrations of nitrate r s 0 55 0 73 p 0 05 and turbidity r s 0 52 0 76 p 0 05 whereas all the other species seemed to have higher abundancies in less polluted environments with slightly higher ph such as those found at 132chil2 in fact navicula lanceolata nitzschia inconspicua nitzschia dissipata and others were strongly correlated with low values of total p r s 0 58 0 72 0 61 0 62 respectively p 0 05 and nitrate r s 0 64 0 58 0 69 0 68 respectively p 0 05 and

kelly s scores were not significantly correlated with any physicochemical variable additionally the percentage of motile species was also assessed but no significant differences were found in global results f 2 47 p 0 05 but there was a tendency for higher percentages at 132chil6 4 discussion historical data provided information of water quality and trophic gradients in the urban stretch of rio chili despite missing data and irregular frequencies of samplings a general situation of deteriorated trophic states even upstream of the urban area of arequipa 132chil1 and 132chil2 was demonstrated through total p concentrations from both historical and recent records which exceeded the peruvian water quality standard of 0 15mg l minam 2015 in fact this river is formed by the outlet of aguadablanca reservoir which had previously been reported as a hypertrophic system with mean total p concentrations of 0 12mg l crhcqch 2013 thus the present study documented that the sampling points located upstream the urban area of arequipa 132chil1 to 132chil3 are already suffering the effects of anthropogenic influences occurring in the watershed such as trout aquaculture agriculture and livestock the situation downstream of the urban area is even more critical since both historical data and recent sampling revealed longitudinal increases of pollution resulting from municipal wastewater discharge historical data also provided information about main cations ca na k mg and conductivity which showed to have an influence over the general behavior of water quality in the urban stretch of the river since significant longitudinal increases were detected this may be related with soil laundering during rainy seasons mainly by the natural short vegetal covering predominating in the watershed mohammed et al 2017 however conductivity and cations concentrations ranged below limits of peruvian water quality standard minam 2015 and no significant ecological effects are expected since concentrations were relatively low when compared with values influencing diatoms ecology mangadze et al 2017 conversely al and fe presented some concentrations exceeding local standards but they seem to have no importance as was suggested by the pca fig 2 total p showed a more significant influence and exhibited a major importance in characterizing the ecological condition of the río chili with nitrogen and other physicochemical variables related to carbon and nutrients pollution playing a secondary role as it has been described for other hyper eutrophic aquatic environments giani et al 2005 figueredo et al 2016a the increasing total p concentrations along the river are probably a consequence of wastewater discharge and the expansion of the urban area of arequipa crhcqch 2013 since human activities often result in a large addition of p to waterbodies carpenter et al 1998 high concentrations of phosphorus in water may increase the rates of primary production and decomposition which causes a depletion of dissolved oxygen correll 1998 these tendencies were reinforced by our data since bod5 was also an important variable for characterizing the system and was strongly related to total p and po4 p concentrations furthermore do depletion in río chili was probably intensified by increasing temperature from upstream to downstream which decreases gas solubility in water and increases metabolic rates cox 2003 dodds and tsit total p indexes were useful in describing changes in water quality along the course of río chili their scores demonstrated a longitudinal gradient of eutrophication with a maximum pollution level occurring at 132chil6 according to both historical and recent data the high degree of homogeneity among the classifications of the samples by tsil and tsit po4 p indicates that these indexes were less sensitive at detecting spatial temporal variation and thus were not suitable for evaluating the effects of human actions in the region the low sensitivity of tsit po4 p could be expected since po4 p has less influence in driving eutrophication than total p as shown by previous researchers correll 1998 figueredo et al 2014 2016b on the other hand the wide variations of tsil and tsit po4 p suggest the need of local adaptation of these indexes that would improve their sensitivity for describing the environmental gradient in this andean stream the monitoring period of 2015 experienced temperatures typical of peruvian summer and spring with mild values due to elevation and small seasonal variation dodds and tsit total p indexes were applied to evaluating the data collected from the monitoring period of 2015 and classified 132chil2 132chil4 and 132chil6 as eutrophic this increase in trophic levels compared to historical records especially for 132chil2 and 132chil4 may be due to lower flow rates of the discharge from agua blanca which decreases the dilution of pollutants discharged along the entire course of the river diatom species identified in río chili were indicative of trophic pollution at 132chil2 and 132chil4 there was a dominance of navicula lanceolata and cocconeis placentula which are indicative of moderate levels of organic pollution kelly et al 2001 these species altered dominance between winter and spring probably due to increases in temperatures creating unfavorable conditions for navicula lanceolata which is well adapted to cold waters spaulding et al 2010 additionally organic pollution at these two points does not appear to have reached an extreme level because non resistant species like achnanthes minutissima and encyonema minutum kelly et al 2001 oliva martin et al 2005 ponader et al 2007 were detected the higher abundances of nitzschia inconspicua observed when higher total p concentrations were recorded can be explained by its known resistance to p pollution kelly et al 2001 2015 eolimna subminuscula was previously identified as tolerant to organic pollution related to domestic and industrial discharges salomoni et al 2006 and tolerant to eutrophic conditions with low do concentrations van dam et al 1994 these attributes probably explain the dominance of this species at 132chil6 which possessed high concentrations of organic matter and high levels of trophic pollution the summary of the community results suggests that the above mentioned species could be used as indicators of water quality for río chili the cca analysis fig 4 illustrated the relationships between indicator species and the organic and trophic pollution levels detected at each sampling point the relationship of nitzschia lanceolata and nitzschia inconspicua with mid to low conditions of turbidity and total p at 132chil2 and 132chil4 was confirmed whereas e subminuscula and nitzschia sp1 were related to high levels of organic and trophic pollution at 132chil6 the shannon index h indicated greater diversity at 132chil2 and 132chil4 when compared to 132chil6 where higher loads of organic pollutants resulted in decreased diatom biodiversity because of losses of species that were non resistant to pollution this result has been commonly observed in streams exposed to pollution jüttner et al 2010 moresco and rodrigues 2014 kelly s and rott s indexes reinforced the evidence of increasing eutrophication from upstream to downstream these indexes classified 132chil2 132chi4 and 132chil6 as meso eutrophic to eu hypertrophic and 132chil6 as eu hypertrophic since none of the species with more than 1 of relative abundancy were previously reported as unreliable for trophic classification based on kelly s or rott s tdi besse lototskaya et al 2011 these indexes are expected to be a good fit to the dynamics of diatom assemblages in río chili rott s index was more closely correlated with total p than kelly s tdi indicating a higher specificity for assessing trophic states in río chili kelly s tdi is highly influenced by organic pollution which causes an increase in abundance of motile species thus this index gives an important insight into the contribution of organic pollution to eutrophication kelly 1997 but is less specific in detecting longitudinal phosphorus increases however the combined application of both indexes in the urban stretch of río chili suggests that increases in eutrophication and p concentrations were associated with organic pollution occurring from upstream to downstream as previously evidenced by the significant positive correlation between bod5 and total p results from diatom ecological indicators and tdis corresponded more closely to the trophic state classifications of tsis applied to historical records than to the classifications of the results of tsis for 2015 probably due to the lesser dependence of tdis on momentary short term water quality variation such as those caused by increases or decreases in flow lower flow rates discharged from aguadablanca reservoir during 2015 may have caused momentary increases in total p concentrations that do not necessarily have an ecological impact limitations of physicochemical tsis have been reported in terms of producing estimations dependent on water quality at the time of sampling and which may not correspond to the real ecological status of the system padisák 1993 and so they should always be analyzed and interpreted as part of a set of water physicochemical and ecological indicators furthermore since significant correlations were found between rott s tdi and total p nitrate and turbidity this index seemed to be able of summarizing information in relation to several water quality variables beyond merely nutrients concentrations results obtained in the present study also suggest that diatom indexes can be successfully applied in high andean environments especially in streams with similar characteristics to chili river i e altitude ranging up to 3000m a s l slopes up to 10 and water temperatures around 10 25 c thus our results reinforce previous reports indicating the suitability of diatom indexes in assessing eutrophication in streams of the southern hemisphere bellinger et al 2006 moresco and rodriguez 2014 although local investigations into the sensitivity of diatoms and the need for adaptations to the classification boundaries of trophic states are always required finally a sustainable monitoring program for trophic pollution in río chili and similar andean basins polluted with municipal wastewater may include a routine monitoring of diatom assemblages complemented with sporadic evaluation of tsis the sampling and preservation of samples for physicochemical analyses are often more complex and expensive using tdis implies a lower cost and greater flexibility for water authorities in assessing water quality and making quick decisions given that trained taxonomists are locally available the tsis may only need to be assessed a few times a year for detecting variation in physicochemical water quality a monitoring program with these characteristics will allow gathering more and more frequent information without considerable additional costs 5 conclusions diatom species were good indicators of trophic pollution in the río chili nitzschia sp2 eolimna subminuscula and nitzschia sp1 were correlated with high values of total p whereas navicula lanceolata nitzschia inconspicua nitzschia dissipata were highly correlated with low to moderate concentrations of total p which was identified as the master variable driving trophic states dodds index tsit total p and rott s and kelly s tdis performed well in describing the trophic levels of río chili and proved to be suitable for evaluating ecological impacts derived from the anthropogenic effects of the urban area of arequipa these indexes also coincided in detecting a longitudinal increase in trophic levels caused by discharge of municipal wastewater and urban occupation in río chili tsit total p and dodds index should always be employed as part of water quality assessment in order to prevent estimations dependent entirely on momentary conditions periodical evaluation of tsis may help in controlling general physicochemical water quality

1101,ria formosa lagoon is a coastal system in the south of portugal characterized by sediments contaminated from urban and industrial pollution emissions in this study sediments from two contrasted metal contamination level sites colonized by sarcocornia fruticosa were used in an on site experimentation the heavy metal removal efficiencies of s fruticosa with and without bioaugmentation using autochthonous metal resistant isolated yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae were compared after 15 days of incubation the total amount of metal concentration cd pb ni cr and cu in sediments and plant matter were compared we found a striking difference between heavily contaminated site and less contaminated site metal reductions in heavily contaminated site were generated more by s fruticosa which was inoculated with s cerevisiae in the less contaminated sediments the higher percentage reductions were achieved with s fruticosa alone our results indicate that despite the phytoremediation potential of s fruticosa the addition of s cerevisiae increases the plant phytoremediation capacity keywords metal phytoremediation sarcocornia fruticosa bioaugmentation saccharomyces cerevisiae saltmarsh sediments 1 introduction pollution of soils and water with heavy metals is one of the most serious environmental and human health hazards jian et al 2008 in 2011 it was reported that there were approximately 100 000ha of land contaminated by heavy metals in europe and in the usa not to mention contaminated waters liu et al 2011 heavy metals come from various anthropogenic sources such as industrial wastes traffic of boats or ships channels ports docks etc mining activity and agricultural practices rajendran et al 2003 once the heavy metals are released in the environment they spread in the soil air and water liu et al 2011 the toxicity of metals depends on the initial chemical form and its bioavailability is determined by the cation exchange capacity if both the metal concentration and the cation exchange capacity are high the toxicity will be low thus not all metals pose major concern to the ecosystem in fact there are three classes of metals in the environment essential metals with biological functions nonessential and non toxic metals without biological functions and toxic metals rajendran et al 2003 the most environmentally important metallic pollutants are arsenic cadmium copper mercury lead and zinc polluted sites often contain mixtures of heavy metals safronova et al 2011 even heavy metals that are essential for biological processes become toxic at higher exposure levels and can cause physiological and genetic changes to plants insects aquatic and benthic fauna fish birds mammals and humans rajendran et al 2003 metal accumulation speciation mobility and stability in the sediment also depend on the physical and chemical characteristics of the ecosystem such as ph the redox potential of the system the temperature the biological activity the concentration of metal the organic matter content the grain size and the nature and solubility of organic and inorganic ligands reboreda and caçador 2007 for instance when the ph is high metal retention is greater and solubility is lower ghosh and singh 2005 unlike organic contaminants that can be degraded by soil microorganisms heavy metals need to be immobilized or physically removed ghosh and singh 2005 wetlands can be sources as well as sinks for contaminants water and sediments contaminated by heavy metals pose a major environmental and human health problem that highlights the need for metal removal rai 2012 there are different conventional techniques to clean up an ecosystem from heavy metals alkaline precipitation ion exchange columns electrochemical removal filtration and membrane technologies are the most widely available technologies for heavy metal removal rai 2008 these conventional technologies are costly and often unaffordable for developing countries for instance in the usa and europe the cost to decontaminate polluted soils or water is expected to be around 20 billion per year liu et al 2011 in addition the conventional technologies can alter the structure of the ecosystem and even its productivity causing adverse impacts that can cascade through aquatic ecosystems rai 2008 some of these remediation methods consist of incineration or landfilling and are not always sufficient in reducing ecosystem and human exposure kuiper et al 2004 these techniques may cause the accumulation of metals in the soil frequently with risks to the environment this is why a case can be made concerning the importance of using natural processes to remove heavy metals from the environment leduc and terry 2005 in contrast biological methods represent a reliable and low cost technologies up to 100 times less costly compared to the chemical and physical methods klein 2008 and are a more sustainable and environmental friendly solution moreover it does not require a lot of maintenance liu et al 2011 adesina et al 2017 in summary these approaches represent a promising approach to clean and restore moderately contaminated local environments dary et al 2010 adesina et al 2017 biological remediation considers different approaches including i bioaugmentation which consists of inoculation of microbes with required capacities groudeva et al 2001 rajendran et al 2003 ii biostimulation which consists of the addition of nutrients carpio et al 2016 huang et al 2018 iii phytoremediation or plant based bioremediation ghosh and singh 2005 iv rhizoremediation or use of rhizospheric microorganisms in combination with plants kuiper et al 2004 jing et al 2007 the ph plays an important role in the toxicity of heavy metals in fact at acidic ph levels heavy metals tend to form free ionic species with more protons available to saturate metal binding sites the adsorbent surface is further positively charged thus reducing the attraction between adsorbent and metal cations therefore heavy metal becomes more bioavailable thereby increasing its toxicity ayangbenro and babalola 2017 biota can influence this process as some microbes can reduce these ions since the negatively charged groups of the bacterial cell wall adsorb metal cations rajendran et al 2003 the inoculation of viable populations of microorganisms will contribute to immobilization of heavy metals through cellular sequestration and accumulation and to reduce metal bioavailability and mobility by forming a stable community with the indigenous microflora groudeva et al 2001 rajendran et al 2003 it is possible to use bacteria which are heavy metal resistant that can be isolated from heavy metal contaminated soils jian et al 2008 or also to use yeast since yeast can adapt and multiply easily in different conditions of ph temperature and availability of nutrients most importantly the yeast can develop in very contaminated environments boularab et al 2011 rufino et al 2011 however there are some other important factors that influence bioremediation such as the size and type of the sediment the organic matter the nature of the pollutants the structure and hydrogeology of the soil or water and also the nutritional state and microbial composition of the site kuiper et al 2004 phytoremediation is emerging as the most practical cleanup technology by using certain species of plants to remove sequester or detoxify the pollutants from soil sediments and water and has been applied more intensively in recent decades ghosh and singh 2005 phytoremediation of heavy metals may take one of several forms such as phytoextraction rhizofiltration phytostabilization and phytovolatilization ghosh and singh 2005 the ideal plant for phytoremediation should grow rapidly produce a high amount of biomass and be able to tolerate high concentrations of metals and be able to bioaccumulate the metals in plant tissue although some species of plants have exceptionally high metal accumulating capacity most of these have a slow growth rate and often produce limited amounts of biomass when the concentration of available metal in the contaminated soil is very high jing et al 2007 an alternative is to use species with a lower metal accumulating capacity but higher growth rates or to provide them with associated plant growth promoting rhizospheric microorganisms navya et al 2015 rhizospheric microorganisms are known to affect the mobility of heavy metals and their availability to the plant through the release of chelating agents acidification phosphate solubilization and redox changes abou shanab et al 2003 the use of rhizomicrobes in combination with plants has been shown to provide high efficiency for phytoremediation of metal contaminated soils and sediments abou shanab et al 2003 ma et al 2016 therefore the potential and the exact mechanism of rhizosphere microorganisms to enhance phytoremediation of soil heavy metals pollution have recently received more attention whiting et al 2001 ma et al 2016 other factors which support the use of the rhizoremediation approach are that this approach does not diminish the esthetic appeal of the site has a low cost presents no need for further recycling preserves the soil fertility and is not disruptive of ecological processes ganesan 2012 the concentration of metals in the sediment is linked to the presence of vegetation reboreda and caçador 2007 in fact saltmarsh sediments without vegetation contain lower metal concentrations than those covered by vegetation moreira da silva et al 2013 2015 ecotone vegetation as saltmarsh ecosystems are frequent recipients of metals discharges and most saltmarsh plants such as s fruticosa s perennis halimione portulacoides and spartina maritime have the ability to accumulate metals both in the shoots and roots of the plants thus their ability to phytostabilize the contaminants in the rhizosediment is an important aspect in biogeochemistry on site and in the ecosystem autoremediation processes duarte et al 2009 in this study different techniques of bioremediation were tested for the removal of heavy metals cd pb ni cr and cu from the contaminated sediment of the ria formosa saltmarsh ecosystem we aimed to compare the efficiency of the treatment of metal contaminated saltmarsh sediments with different techniques including i bioaugmentation accompanied by inoculation with indigenous heavy metal resistant microorganisms ii phytoremediation with the introduction of plants iii rhizoremediation with the introduction of both indigenous heavy metal resistant strains and plants 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the ria formosa is a mesotidal coastal lagoon with 18 000ha of area permanently connected to the sea throughout six channels it is protected from sea storms by large sand dunes and five barrier islands dionisio et al 2000 it is located in the region of algarve fig 1 the southern region of portugal and represents the largest lagoon of the portuguese coast bebianno and machado 1997 one third of the ria is influenced by a semi diurnal tidal cycle caetano et al 2002 there are many different habitats in ria formosa which include saltmarsh mud flats sand banks and dunes which support a rich diversity of flora and fauna mudge and bebianno 1997 halophytes species have an important role in ria formosa they are adapted to high salinity and to inundation periods s fruticosa is one of the most widely distributed of these species moreira da silva et al 2015 in ecological terms ria formosa has an important role because of its salinity about 37ppm nutrient concentration and water renewal dionisio et al 2000 the inundated area is shallow averaging 3m and represents an important habitat and nursery area for many species such as shellfish mudge and bebianno 1997 the lagoon receives a large input of nutrients due to tidal suspension of sediments and due to the churning activity of benthic organisms caetano et al 2002 these nutrient levels support highly productive and important fishing and mariculture industries thus the lagoon plays an important role in the regional economy since the total catch in algarve represents 20 of the portuguese harvest bebianno and machado 1997 in 1997 ria formosa national park was created to protect this natural site from the negative impact of economic development of the surrounding areas moreira da silva et al 2013 2015 despite the creation of the park this development has led to the spread of anthropogenic contaminants coming from different sources untreated sewage industrial discharges agricultural runoff urban runoff ports marinas and aquaculture mudge and bebianno 1997 among these consequences is the contamination of the ecosystem with high concentrations of metals moreira da silva et al 2013 2015 2 2 plant species used s fruticosa is a typical halophyte native species in mediterranean saltmarshes gonzález alcaraz et al 2011 it is a dominant species of the upper saltmarsh in the ria formosa which appears frequently in pure stands carvalho et al 2010 moreira da silva et al 2015 s fruticosa is frequently found in areas that are characterized by contaminated sediments as it has a high tolerance to heavy metals duarte et al 2009 moreira da silva et al 2015 many studies highlight the role of this species on retention bioavailability and remediation of metal in coastal ecosystems caetano et al 2008 rai 2008 almeida et al 2011 moreira da silva et al 2015 moreover s fruticosa is usually used in laboratory studies of bioremediation of organic and metal contaminated sediments martins et al 2008 carvalho et al 2010 gonzález alcaraz et al 2011 the selection of this species as the basis of observation allows studies to be carried out in the field and in the laboratory 2 3 sampling and field measurements sediment samples were collected at two sites a and b fig 1 with different levels of metal contamination site a is the most polluted located immediately below the discharge of an urban effluent site b is more distant from that discharge point and previous studies dionisio et al 2000 of site b obtained low values of sediment metal concentrations both sites are influenced by a semi diurnal tidal cycle caetano et al 2002 and covered mainly by s fruticosa vegetation moreira da silva et al 2015 sediment samples with and without vegetation were collected from 30cm maximum length for s fruticosa roots with a sampler from both sites the ph and temperature were measured in situ using a portable multi meter hach hq30d redox potential was determined using a hanna ph mv meter hi 931401 with a combined platinum electrode hi 3131b values of redox potential were accepted after a 5min period of stabilization 2 4 isolation and characterization of heavy metal resistant microorganisms a sample with150g of sediment from site a colonized with s fruticosa was mixed with ringer s solution 10 v v and then incubated in an orbital rotary shaker 140rpm at 30 c for 30min two ml of the supernatant was diluted with 8ml of saline solution 0 8 nacl and 100μl were plated onto agar plates amended with 100mgl 1of cr standard solution of crcl3 100mgl 1 of zn standard solution of znso4 and 100mgl 1of pb standard solution of pb no3 2 after incubating at 30 c for 3 days morphologically distinct colonies were randomly picked purified and restreaked on the same media until the colonies of each isolate were apparently morphologically homogeneous ma et al 2009 mesquita et al 2016 strains of saccharomyces genera were isolated and identified as saccharomyces cerevisiae by using standard morphological and biochemical tests including the api 20c aux kits biomerieux gelis et al 2015 willemsen et al 1997 2 5 yeast inoculum the metal tolerant isolated yeast was grown and maintained in a liquid medium which contained 5 0g of yeast extract 10 0g of tryptone 10 0g of nacl and 100mgl 1of cr standard solution of crcl3 100mgl 1of zn standard solution of znso4 and 100mgl 1of pb standard solution of pb no3 2 chu et al 1981 bergman 2001 for the inoculum used in the bioremediation experiment yeast cells were inoculated into 250ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 150ml of sterile medium without metal addition and cultivated aerobically in an orbital rotary shaker 140rpm at 30 c for 24h chu et al 1981 bergman 2001 2 6 experimental setup and statistical analyses 2 6 1 pot experiment the experimentation was performed in situ in the intertidal zone near the sampling stations and using natural sediments from sites a and b in both cases without vegetation the factorial scheme was 1 control just sediment 2 sediment inoculated with selected metal resistant yeast bioaugmentation treatment bioa 3 sediment planted with s fruticosa phytoremediation treatment phyt 4 sediment inoculated with selected metal resistant yeast and planted with s fruticosa rhizoremediation treatment phyt bioa two sets of replicates were set up each pot was filled up with 15cm of sediment according to martins et al 2008 the biomass of the plant is concentrated in the first 15cm of the sediment the liquid media with inoculum grown was centrifuged at 10 000rpm at room temperature for 6min the supernatant was discharged and the pellet suspended with saline solution 0 8 nacl and adjusted to a concentration of 2 0 108 colonies forming units cfu g 1 of sediment based on the optical density od λ600 using a spectrophotometer spectrum lab 22pc machado et al 2010 the inoculum of the selected yeast used for the bioaugmentation effect was homogenized before the application to the experimental sediments to create the bioa conditions 50ml of inoculum was applied to sediment in phyt bioa conditions the same inoculum volume was added but in this case nearby the stems of s fruticosa 2 6 2 organic matter and metal analysis after two weeks in situ malik 2004 abdallah 2012 singh et al 2015 all plants were harvested and sediments collected in the laboratory the aerial parts of plants were separated from the roots aerial organs of s fruticosa were washed with distilled water the roots were washed thoroughly with0 1moll 1 solution of hcl and tap water to remove all of the adhered sediment and then washed with distilled water all vegetal material was oven dried at 40 c weighed using an analytical balance precisa 205a sensitive to 0 1mg and ground with an agate mortar for metal analysis wang et al 2001 moreira da silva et al 2015 the sediments were oven dried at 40 c and weighed each sample was divided in two portions one part was used for organic matter determination and the other one was homogenized in an agate mortar for metal analysis the organic matter contents of the sediments were determined by loss on ignition loi at 600 c for 2h otte 1991 for the metal analysis samples were digested by microwaves in high pressure teflon vessels a procedural blank was prepared and included in each digestion batch of 10 samples metals pb cd ni cr cu in sediments and plants were quantified by atomic absorption spectrometry aas gbc avanta sigma australia provided with a deuterium background correction with electrothermal atomization gbc graphite furnace 3000 and an auto sampler pal 3000 moreira da silva et al 2015 2 6 3 phytoextraction the phytoextraction capacity can be quantified using the bioconcentration factor bcf and the translocation factor tf bcf is calculated as the ratio between metal concentrations in roots metal concentration in sediment yoon et al 2006 ali et al 2013 tf is calculated as the ratio between metal concentrations in plant aerial organs metal concentration in plant roots yoon et al 2006 ali et al 2013 3 results 3 1 sediments characterization during the sampling period temperature was similar in both sites the minimum was 18 1 c in site a and maximum 19 6 c in site b table 1 the ph showed some differences according to the level of pollution it was lower at site a between 5 98 and 6 48 the most polluted area and higher at site b where the values varied between 7 20 and 7 30 the redox potential was higher in sediments colonized by s fruticosa in sites a and b and the maximum value was in the less contaminated site b as was expected organic matter om was higher in the most polluted area site a and sediment metal concentrations cd pb ni cr zn followed the same pattern in general for both sites and for all metals sediments with s fruticosa presented higher concentrations than sediments without s fruticosa except for ni and cr in site b where the values are similar 3 2 bioremediation treatments effects on sediment metal concentrations the heavy metal reduction was calculated by comparing the metal concentration values of different experimental conditions with the metal concentration values of control conditions in sediment from site a with phyt bioa conditions a greater decrease of heavy metal concentrations was observed in this case the sediment metal concentrations decreased more than 40 for ni 30 for cu 37 for cr and 19 for cd fig 2 to the contrary in sediment from site b corresponding to the less polluted area the phyt conditions presented the greater decrease of heavy metal concentrations 44 for pb 34 for cd 29 for cu and 22 for ni lead was an exception to this trend pb was extracted by s fruticosa just when assisted with the yeast in this case the pb reduction was 67 fig 2 3 3 bioconcentration factor bcf and translocation factor tf in sarcocornia fruticosa bioremediation treatments using only plant or the plant with the metal resistant yeast fig 2 showed different profiles of heavy metal concentration decrease after 15 days of incubation depending on the initial heavy metal concentrations in the sediments in site a more polluted area the inoculation with the isolated yeast enhanced plant bioaccumulation for cd bcf 18 fig 3 and decreased for ni and particularly for pb however the low tf values obtained showed that cd is not translocated to the aerial organs and it is stored in the roots fig 3 despite high concentrations of heavy metals accumulated in the roots of s fruticosa these concentrations were not observed in the aerial organs indicating that metal translocation was prevented in case of higher heavy metal sediment contamination results showed that in lower heavy metal contaminated sediments from site b values of bcf are greater using only the plant the bcf quantified was 1 just for 3 metals 3 5 for cu 3 2 for ni 1 8 for cr 1 8 fig 4 the inoculation of s fruticosa rhizosphere with the metal resistant isolated yeast decreased the bcf and the tf in case of pb the tf of s fruticosa alone was higher in sediment from site b than obtained in sediments from site a more polluted suggesting the influence of pollution level on the pb translocation capacity 4 discussion various factors may affect the solubility and availability of metals in saltmarsh sediments and vegetation including concentration and speciation of metals and characteristics of the sediment the characteristics of the sediment are influenced by redox potential organic matter content biotic aspects concentrations of inorganic and organic ligands including plants exudates cation exchange capacity among other factors in turn these factors may influence the mutual interactions between plants and the surrounding chemical environment determining the role played by plants on trace metal distribution and uptake these roles may vary among plant species and holding species constant may vary among locations with different characteristics reboreda and caçador 2007 popenda 2014 moreira da silva et al 2015 in the present study all sediments that had an approximately neutral ph ph 6 7 2 were in a reduced state eh 27 159mv and had a wide range of organic matter content from 3 to 19 organic matter may play an important role as metals can be sorbed on organic matter alongi et al 1996 jansen et al 2001 popenda 2014 examined the effect of redox changes on the mobility of cr cu pb zn and as in sample of five dredged sediments originating from disposal sites in the netherlands this study showed that an increase in the redox potential above 400mv up to 503mv resulted in an increase in solubility 1 of cr cu pb and zn in all sediments and had a large effect 40 80 on the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds to so4 2 several previous works showed that halophyte vegetation can sequester and inherently tolerate the high metal concentrations found in saltmarsh sediments caetano et al 2008 reboreda and caçador 2007 moreira da silva et al 2015 an increasing number of studies have been carried out to understand the role of these species on retention bioavailability and remediation of the pollutants in coastal areas caetano et al 2008 rai 2008 almeida et al 2011 moreira da silva et al 2015 moreira da silva et al 2013 investigated the role of s fruticosa on the presence and distribution of trace elements ag cd cu cr mo ni pb and zn amongst sediment and plant tissues in ria fomosa lagoon the study demonstrated that s fruticosa could fix metals from the surrounding belowground environment and accumulate them mainly in roots metal translocation to aerial parts of the plants was in general residual in fact metal concentrations in roots were greater than in the aboveground organs of the plant and this provides evidence of the weak translocation caetano et al 2008 reboreda and caçador 2007 our results showed two different behavior patterns of s fruticosa depending on metal concentrations in saltmarsh sediments in sediments with higher contamination levels inoculation with yeast resulted in an increase of phytoremediation capacity inoculation of the isolated yeast enhanced plant bioaccumulation for cd in roots with no translocation to aerial organs of the plant we hypothesise that s cerevisiae can improve cd phytostabilization by s fruticosa in sediments that are heavily contaminated with metals however in less contaminated environment s fruticosa alone showed best results these data were in concordance with liang et al 2017 who showed that when juncus maritimus and phragmites australis rhizospheres were inoculated with a microbial consortium containing cd resistant microorganisms the total amount of cd increased up to seven times in phragmites australis stems and up to 48 in juncus maritimus belowground structures in fact there are certain limitations to phytoremediation system among these limitations are chemistry and the level of contamination the impacts on vegetation and climatic conditions tangahu et al 2011 many phytoremediation projects demonstrated the inefficiency of solely using plants for heavy metal removal mainly in cases of high heavy metal contamination levels liang et al 2017 and the importance of supplementary methods such as microbe assisted phytoremediation hechmi et al 2014 the use of plants and their associated microorganisms for the removal of contaminants from the environment is based on the increase of microbial population numbers in the rhizosphere and or endosphere and on the stimulation of their metabolic activity kuiper et al 2004 microorganisms can influence the mobility of metals in the sediment either by accumulation or by producing substances such as organic compounds or sulphides that directly change metal mobility liang et al 2017 therefore microbe assisted phytoremediation represents a powerful emerging approach to sequester degrade transform assimilate metabolize or detoxify contaminants from soil sediment or groundwater moreira et al 2006 dary et al 2010 ma et al 2016 navya et al 2015 in our case a possible explanation of the pattern observed in sediments with higher contamination levels could be due to the heavy metal biosorption capacities of s cerevisiae as demonstrated in many studies volesky and may phillips 1995 wang and chen 2006 our results showed that differential metal reductions can be achieved depending on the level of heavy metal contamination contrary to microorganisms high heavy metal concentrations may inhibit plant growth and thus may limit phytoremediation application this can be related to phytotoxicity tangahu et al 2011 in their study on competitive biosorption of pb cd cu and as ions using algae sulaymon et al 2013 showed that the percentage removal does not alter greatly if the concentration increases from 10 to 50mgl 1 but when the concentrations increase to 100 and 200mgl 1 that the depletion in percentage removal will be pronounced this may be explained by the fact that 1g of algae may contain enough exchangeable sites for the lower concentration range but the exchangeable sites in 1g will not be enough to cover these concentrations romera et al 2008 however the performance of s cerevisiae to remove heavy metals seemed to be independent of initial concentration as showed by farhan and khadom 2015 and in contrast to the results obtained from plants the yeast metal biosorption has been observed to increase as initial concentration increases paravathi et al 2006 farhan and khadom 2015 fadel et al 2017 this may be attributed to the active binding sites available for available sorbate ions fadel et al 2017 in terms of plant behavior in the more polluted area site a the inoculation with the isolated yeast enhanced plant bioaccumulation for cd as well as the efficiency of phytoremediation as illustrated in many works plant associated microorganisms can be exploited to improve the efficiency of phytoremediation processes sessitsch et al 2013 sangthong et al 2015 tiwari and lata 2018 similar results have also obtained by nunes et al 2014 that demonstrated that the cd phytostabilization potential for two aquatic plants juncus maritimus and phragmites australis was increased when the rhizosphere was inoculated with autochthonous microbial consortium boechat et al 2017 showed that metal resistant rhizobacteria improved phytoextraction of mucuna deeringiana in soils contaminated with multiple metals from a gold mining area the same behavior was demonstrated by ma et al 2016 with respect to cd zn and pb contamination inoculating metal hyperaccumulating plants with their own selected functional endophytic bacterial strains also sangthong et al 2015 demonstrated that micrococcus sp tistr2221 significantly increased cd accumulation in the roots and shoots of z mays l compared to uninoculated plants however in the less polluted area site b the metal phytoremediation ability was demonstrated by bcf greater than one for cu ni and cr using only the plant remediation in this case high tf to pb was observed this makes evident the natural potential of s fruticosa to transport pb to aerial organs and consequently to its phytoextraction and illustrates the efficiency of phytoremediation in sediments moderately contaminated with heavy metals d souza et al 2013 in fact translocation of metals to aerial organs is an important biochemical process and desirable for effective phytoextraction as highlighted by dixit et al 2015 a high concentration of heavy metals accumulated in plants causes irreversible damage to plant tissues resulting in plant growth retardation barocsi et al 2003 to improve phytoextraction performance plant growth rate should be promoted sangthong et al 2015 and so the need of microbe augmentation assisted phytoextraction in high heavy metal contaminated sediments teixeira et al 2014 the phytoextraction process may be enhanced by soil amendments that increase trace element availability in the soil sessitsch et al 2013 in general halophytes plants respond to heavy metal toxicity via several molecular mechanisms liang et al 2017 these include i metal ions binding to cell walls ii metals chelating within cytosol iii ros defense mechanisms and iv metal sequestration in vacuoles ali et al 2013 kushwaha et al 2016 the cell wall plays an important role in metal storage in plants maestri et al 2010 and in the immobilization of metal ions dalcorso et al 2013 storage and concomitant detoxification of excess heavy metals generally occurs within the vacuole martinoia et al 2007 the presence of metals in roots results from physical adsorption being well established that heavy metals may bind to pectic substances and hemicellulose of cell walls due to electrostatic bonding khotimchenko et al 2007 hu et al 2010 lutts et al 2016 studies with halimione portulacoides a dicotyledon halophyte as s fruticosa showed that metals such as zinc cadmium and nickel were mostly retained in the cell wall organelles particularly in the roots sousa et al 2008 however sesuvium portulacastrum was recognized as efficiently accumulating heavy metals such as chromium cadmium copper and zinc sodium and chloride mainly through the leaves when compared to stem and root ayyappan et al 2016 in general dicotyledons plants exhibit a high root cation exchange capacity holding high amounts of metals in free space and show higher uptake than monocotyledons carneiro et al 2001 nie et al 2017 found that the binding mechanism of uranium u vi of landoltia punctata in mine wastewater was due to a lamellar crystal insoluble nano u vi and u iv phosphate minerals such as chernikovite which might have resulted from the binding with phosphate groups among the promising biosorbents for heavy metal removal which have been researched during the past decades s cerevisiae has received increasing attention s cerevisiae is widely used in food and beverage production is easily cultivated using cheap media it is also a by product in large quantity as a waste of the fermentation industry and is easily manipulated at molecular level wang and chen 2006 many studies demonstrated that s cerevisiae biomass plays an important role in heavy metal biosorption it can accumulate metal ions such as cu2 cd2 pb2 or ni2 in biomass volesky and may phillips 1995 characteristics of s cerevisiae in heavy metal biosorption have been extensively discussed and metal binding capacity for various heavy metals has been well illustrated as in wang and chen 2006 karlberg et al 2002 showed that the crystal structures of ferrochelatase the terminal enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway from s cerevisiae complex with co ii and with two inhibitors cd ii and hg i moreover the co ii and cd ii complexes increase the metal binding in this study this potential was noticed as the inoculation by s cerevisiae contributed to increase the phytoremediation potential of s fruticosa for the metals in general however the percentage of decrease varied with the level of metal concentration in the sediment the addition of this autochthonous microorganism resistant to heavy metals seems to be a valuable strategy to potentiate phytoremediation in metal moderately contaminated saltmarshes 5 conclusions s cerevisiae has a potential for increasing the phytoremediation capacity of s fruticosa in saltmarshes with high heavy metal contamination and this is more evident for cd however in less heavy metal contaminated conditions the treatments using just s fruticosa showed higher heavy metal reduction that the ones inoculated with s cerevisiae s fruticosa acts as a natural phytostabilizer for cu ni cr and pb while the s cerevisiae inoculation enhanced cd phytostabilization by that halophyte specie the translocation capacity of s fruticosa was affected by the heavy metal contamination levels in sediments this was particularly noted for cd in less polluted conditions however plants will affect the soil through their ability to lower the ph and oxygenate the sediment which affects the availability of the metals increasing their bioavailability therefore in the further studies form and bioavailability of cd pb ni cr and cu in sediment should be analyzed conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to ethical standards acknowledgements none funding body none 
1101,ria formosa lagoon is a coastal system in the south of portugal characterized by sediments contaminated from urban and industrial pollution emissions in this study sediments from two contrasted metal contamination level sites colonized by sarcocornia fruticosa were used in an on site experimentation the heavy metal removal efficiencies of s fruticosa with and without bioaugmentation using autochthonous metal resistant isolated yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae were compared after 15 days of incubation the total amount of metal concentration cd pb ni cr and cu in sediments and plant matter were compared we found a striking difference between heavily contaminated site and less contaminated site metal reductions in heavily contaminated site were generated more by s fruticosa which was inoculated with s cerevisiae in the less contaminated sediments the higher percentage reductions were achieved with s fruticosa alone our results indicate that despite the phytoremediation potential of s fruticosa the addition of s cerevisiae increases the plant phytoremediation capacity keywords metal phytoremediation sarcocornia fruticosa bioaugmentation saccharomyces cerevisiae saltmarsh sediments 1 introduction pollution of soils and water with heavy metals is one of the most serious environmental and human health hazards jian et al 2008 in 2011 it was reported that there were approximately 100 000ha of land contaminated by heavy metals in europe and in the usa not to mention contaminated waters liu et al 2011 heavy metals come from various anthropogenic sources such as industrial wastes traffic of boats or ships channels ports docks etc mining activity and agricultural practices rajendran et al 2003 once the heavy metals are released in the environment they spread in the soil air and water liu et al 2011 the toxicity of metals depends on the initial chemical form and its bioavailability is determined by the cation exchange capacity if both the metal concentration and the cation exchange capacity are high the toxicity will be low thus not all metals pose major concern to the ecosystem in fact there are three classes of metals in the environment essential metals with biological functions nonessential and non toxic metals without biological functions and toxic metals rajendran et al 2003 the most environmentally important metallic pollutants are arsenic cadmium copper mercury lead and zinc polluted sites often contain mixtures of heavy metals safronova et al 2011 even heavy metals that are essential for biological processes become toxic at higher exposure levels and can cause physiological and genetic changes to plants insects aquatic and benthic fauna fish birds mammals and humans rajendran et al 2003 metal accumulation speciation mobility and stability in the sediment also depend on the physical and chemical characteristics of the ecosystem such as ph the redox potential of the system the temperature the biological activity the concentration of metal the organic matter content the grain size and the nature and solubility of organic and inorganic ligands reboreda and caçador 2007 for instance when the ph is high metal retention is greater and solubility is lower ghosh and singh 2005 unlike organic contaminants that can be degraded by soil microorganisms heavy metals need to be immobilized or physically removed ghosh and singh 2005 wetlands can be sources as well as sinks for contaminants water and sediments contaminated by heavy metals pose a major environmental and human health problem that highlights the need for metal removal rai 2012 there are different conventional techniques to clean up an ecosystem from heavy metals alkaline precipitation ion exchange columns electrochemical removal filtration and membrane technologies are the most widely available technologies for heavy metal removal rai 2008 these conventional technologies are costly and often unaffordable for developing countries for instance in the usa and europe the cost to decontaminate polluted soils or water is expected to be around 20 billion per year liu et al 2011 in addition the conventional technologies can alter the structure of the ecosystem and even its productivity causing adverse impacts that can cascade through aquatic ecosystems rai 2008 some of these remediation methods consist of incineration or landfilling and are not always sufficient in reducing ecosystem and human exposure kuiper et al 2004 these techniques may cause the accumulation of metals in the soil frequently with risks to the environment this is why a case can be made concerning the importance of using natural processes to remove heavy metals from the environment leduc and terry 2005 in contrast biological methods represent a reliable and low cost technologies up to 100 times less costly compared to the chemical and physical methods klein 2008 and are a more sustainable and environmental friendly solution moreover it does not require a lot of maintenance liu et al 2011 adesina et al 2017 in summary these approaches represent a promising approach to clean and restore moderately contaminated local environments dary et al 2010 adesina et al 2017 biological remediation considers different approaches including i bioaugmentation which consists of inoculation of microbes with required capacities groudeva et al 2001 rajendran et al 2003 ii biostimulation which consists of the addition of nutrients carpio et al 2016 huang et al 2018 iii phytoremediation or plant based bioremediation ghosh and singh 2005 iv rhizoremediation or use of rhizospheric microorganisms in combination with plants kuiper et al 2004 jing et al 2007 the ph plays an important role in the toxicity of heavy metals in fact at acidic ph levels heavy metals tend to form free ionic species with more protons available to saturate metal binding sites the adsorbent surface is further positively charged thus reducing the attraction between adsorbent and metal cations therefore heavy metal becomes more bioavailable thereby increasing its toxicity ayangbenro and babalola 2017 biota can influence this process as some microbes can reduce these ions since the negatively charged groups of the bacterial cell wall adsorb metal cations rajendran et al 2003 the inoculation of viable populations of microorganisms will contribute to immobilization of heavy metals through cellular sequestration and accumulation and to reduce metal bioavailability and mobility by forming a stable community with the indigenous microflora groudeva et al 2001 rajendran et al 2003 it is possible to use bacteria which are heavy metal resistant that can be isolated from heavy metal contaminated soils jian et al 2008 or also to use yeast since yeast can adapt and multiply easily in different conditions of ph temperature and availability of nutrients most importantly the yeast can develop in very contaminated environments boularab et al 2011 rufino et al 2011 however there are some other important factors that influence bioremediation such as the size and type of the sediment the organic matter the nature of the pollutants the structure and hydrogeology of the soil or water and also the nutritional state and microbial composition of the site kuiper et al 2004 phytoremediation is emerging as the most practical cleanup technology by using certain species of plants to remove sequester or detoxify the pollutants from soil sediments and water and has been applied more intensively in recent decades ghosh and singh 2005 phytoremediation of heavy metals may take one of several forms such as phytoextraction rhizofiltration phytostabilization and phytovolatilization ghosh and singh 2005 the ideal plant for phytoremediation should grow rapidly produce a high amount of biomass and be able to tolerate high concentrations of metals and be able to bioaccumulate the metals in plant tissue although some species of plants have exceptionally high metal accumulating capacity most of these have a slow growth rate and often produce limited amounts of biomass when the concentration of available metal in the contaminated soil is very high jing et al 2007 an alternative is to use species with a lower metal accumulating capacity but higher growth rates or to provide them with associated plant growth promoting rhizospheric microorganisms navya et al 2015 rhizospheric microorganisms are known to affect the mobility of heavy metals and their availability to the plant through the release of chelating agents acidification phosphate solubilization and redox changes abou shanab et al 2003 the use of rhizomicrobes in combination with plants has been shown to provide high efficiency for phytoremediation of metal contaminated soils and sediments abou shanab et al 2003 ma et al 2016 therefore the potential and the exact mechanism of rhizosphere microorganisms to enhance phytoremediation of soil heavy metals pollution have recently received more attention whiting et al 2001 ma et al 2016 other factors which support the use of the rhizoremediation approach are that this approach does not diminish the esthetic appeal of the site has a low cost presents no need for further recycling preserves the soil fertility and is not disruptive of ecological processes ganesan 2012 the concentration of metals in the sediment is linked to the presence of vegetation reboreda and caçador 2007 in fact saltmarsh sediments without vegetation contain lower metal concentrations than those covered by vegetation moreira da silva et al 2013 2015 ecotone vegetation as saltmarsh ecosystems are frequent recipients of metals discharges and most saltmarsh plants such as s fruticosa s perennis halimione portulacoides and spartina maritime have the ability to accumulate metals both in the shoots and roots of the plants thus their ability to phytostabilize the contaminants in the rhizosediment is an important aspect in biogeochemistry on site and in the ecosystem autoremediation processes duarte et al 2009 in this study different techniques of bioremediation were tested for the removal of heavy metals cd pb ni cr and cu from the contaminated sediment of the ria formosa saltmarsh ecosystem we aimed to compare the efficiency of the treatment of metal contaminated saltmarsh sediments with different techniques including i bioaugmentation accompanied by inoculation with indigenous heavy metal resistant microorganisms ii phytoremediation with the introduction of plants iii rhizoremediation with the introduction of both indigenous heavy metal resistant strains and plants 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the ria formosa is a mesotidal coastal lagoon with 18 000ha of area permanently connected to the sea throughout six channels it is protected from sea storms by large sand dunes and five barrier islands dionisio et al 2000 it is located in the region of algarve fig 1 the southern region of portugal and represents the largest lagoon of the portuguese coast bebianno and machado 1997 one third of the ria is influenced by a semi diurnal tidal cycle caetano et al 2002 there are many different habitats in ria formosa which include saltmarsh mud flats sand banks and dunes which support a rich diversity of flora and fauna mudge and bebianno 1997 halophytes species have an important role in ria formosa they are adapted to high salinity and to inundation periods s fruticosa is one of the most widely distributed of these species moreira da silva et al 2015 in ecological terms ria formosa has an important role because of its salinity about 37ppm nutrient concentration and water renewal dionisio et al 2000 the inundated area is shallow averaging 3m and represents an important habitat and nursery area for many species such as shellfish mudge and bebianno 1997 the lagoon receives a large input of nutrients due to tidal suspension of sediments and due to the churning activity of benthic organisms caetano et al 2002 these nutrient levels support highly productive and important fishing and mariculture industries thus the lagoon plays an important role in the regional economy since the total catch in algarve represents 20 of the portuguese harvest bebianno and machado 1997 in 1997 ria formosa national park was created to protect this natural site from the negative impact of economic development of the surrounding areas moreira da silva et al 2013 2015 despite the creation of the park this development has led to the spread of anthropogenic contaminants coming from different sources untreated sewage industrial discharges agricultural runoff urban runoff ports marinas and aquaculture mudge and bebianno 1997 among these consequences is the contamination of the ecosystem with high concentrations of metals moreira da silva et al 2013 2015 2 2 plant species used s fruticosa is a typical halophyte native species in mediterranean saltmarshes gonzález alcaraz et al 2011 it is a dominant species of the upper saltmarsh in the ria formosa which appears frequently in pure stands carvalho et al 2010 moreira da silva et al 2015 s fruticosa is frequently found in areas that are characterized by contaminated sediments as it has a high tolerance to heavy metals duarte et al 2009 moreira da silva et al 2015 many studies highlight the role of this species on retention bioavailability and remediation of metal in coastal ecosystems caetano et al 2008 rai 2008 almeida et al 2011 moreira da silva et al 2015 moreover s fruticosa is usually used in laboratory studies of bioremediation of organic and metal contaminated sediments martins et al 2008 carvalho et al 2010 gonzález alcaraz et al 2011 the selection of this species as the basis of observation allows studies to be carried out in the field and in the laboratory 2 3 sampling and field measurements sediment samples were collected at two sites a and b fig 1 with different levels of metal contamination site a is the most polluted located immediately below the discharge of an urban effluent site b is more distant from that discharge point and previous studies dionisio et al 2000 of site b obtained low values of sediment metal concentrations both sites are influenced by a semi diurnal tidal cycle caetano et al 2002 and covered mainly by s fruticosa vegetation moreira da silva et al 2015 sediment samples with and without vegetation were collected from 30cm maximum length for s fruticosa roots with a sampler from both sites the ph and temperature were measured in situ using a portable multi meter hach hq30d redox potential was determined using a hanna ph mv meter hi 931401 with a combined platinum electrode hi 3131b values of redox potential were accepted after a 5min period of stabilization 2 4 isolation and characterization of heavy metal resistant microorganisms a sample with150g of sediment from site a colonized with s fruticosa was mixed with ringer s solution 10 v v and then incubated in an orbital rotary shaker 140rpm at 30 c for 30min two ml of the supernatant was diluted with 8ml of saline solution 0 8 nacl and 100μl were plated onto agar plates amended with 100mgl 1of cr standard solution of crcl3 100mgl 1 of zn standard solution of znso4 and 100mgl 1of pb standard solution of pb no3 2 after incubating at 30 c for 3 days morphologically distinct colonies were randomly picked purified and restreaked on the same media until the colonies of each isolate were apparently morphologically homogeneous ma et al 2009 mesquita et al 2016 strains of saccharomyces genera were isolated and identified as saccharomyces cerevisiae by using standard morphological and biochemical tests including the api 20c aux kits biomerieux gelis et al 2015 willemsen et al 1997 2 5 yeast inoculum the metal tolerant isolated yeast was grown and maintained in a liquid medium which contained 5 0g of yeast extract 10 0g of tryptone 10 0g of nacl and 100mgl 1of cr standard solution of crcl3 100mgl 1of zn standard solution of znso4 and 100mgl 1of pb standard solution of pb no3 2 chu et al 1981 bergman 2001 for the inoculum used in the bioremediation experiment yeast cells were inoculated into 250ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 150ml of sterile medium without metal addition and cultivated aerobically in an orbital rotary shaker 140rpm at 30 c for 24h chu et al 1981 bergman 2001 2 6 experimental setup and statistical analyses 2 6 1 pot experiment the experimentation was performed in situ in the intertidal zone near the sampling stations and using natural sediments from sites a and b in both cases without vegetation the factorial scheme was 1 control just sediment 2 sediment inoculated with selected metal resistant yeast bioaugmentation treatment bioa 3 sediment planted with s fruticosa phytoremediation treatment phyt 4 sediment inoculated with selected metal resistant yeast and planted with s fruticosa rhizoremediation treatment phyt bioa two sets of replicates were set up each pot was filled up with 15cm of sediment according to martins et al 2008 the biomass of the plant is concentrated in the first 15cm of the sediment the liquid media with inoculum grown was centrifuged at 10 000rpm at room temperature for 6min the supernatant was discharged and the pellet suspended with saline solution 0 8 nacl and adjusted to a concentration of 2 0 108 colonies forming units cfu g 1 of sediment based on the optical density od λ600 using a spectrophotometer spectrum lab 22pc machado et al 2010 the inoculum of the selected yeast used for the bioaugmentation effect was homogenized before the application to the experimental sediments to create the bioa conditions 50ml of inoculum was applied to sediment in phyt bioa conditions the same inoculum volume was added but in this case nearby the stems of s fruticosa 2 6 2 organic matter and metal analysis after two weeks in situ malik 2004 abdallah 2012 singh et al 2015 all plants were harvested and sediments collected in the laboratory the aerial parts of plants were separated from the roots aerial organs of s fruticosa were washed with distilled water the roots were washed thoroughly with0 1moll 1 solution of hcl and tap water to remove all of the adhered sediment and then washed with distilled water all vegetal material was oven dried at 40 c weighed using an analytical balance precisa 205a sensitive to 0 1mg and ground with an agate mortar for metal analysis wang et al 2001 moreira da silva et al 2015 the sediments were oven dried at 40 c and weighed each sample was divided in two portions one part was used for organic matter determination and the other one was homogenized in an agate mortar for metal analysis the organic matter contents of the sediments were determined by loss on ignition loi at 600 c for 2h otte 1991 for the metal analysis samples were digested by microwaves in high pressure teflon vessels a procedural blank was prepared and included in each digestion batch of 10 samples metals pb cd ni cr cu in sediments and plants were quantified by atomic absorption spectrometry aas gbc avanta sigma australia provided with a deuterium background correction with electrothermal atomization gbc graphite furnace 3000 and an auto sampler pal 3000 moreira da silva et al 2015 2 6 3 phytoextraction the phytoextraction capacity can be quantified using the bioconcentration factor bcf and the translocation factor tf bcf is calculated as the ratio between metal concentrations in roots metal concentration in sediment yoon et al 2006 ali et al 2013 tf is calculated as the ratio between metal concentrations in plant aerial organs metal concentration in plant roots yoon et al 2006 ali et al 2013 3 results 3 1 sediments characterization during the sampling period temperature was similar in both sites the minimum was 18 1 c in site a and maximum 19 6 c in site b table 1 the ph showed some differences according to the level of pollution it was lower at site a between 5 98 and 6 48 the most polluted area and higher at site b where the values varied between 7 20 and 7 30 the redox potential was higher in sediments colonized by s fruticosa in sites a and b and the maximum value was in the less contaminated site b as was expected organic matter om was higher in the most polluted area site a and sediment metal concentrations cd pb ni cr zn followed the same pattern in general for both sites and for all metals sediments with s fruticosa presented higher concentrations than sediments without s fruticosa except for ni and cr in site b where the values are similar 3 2 bioremediation treatments effects on sediment metal concentrations the heavy metal reduction was calculated by comparing the metal concentration values of different experimental conditions with the metal concentration values of control conditions in sediment from site a with phyt bioa conditions a greater decrease of heavy metal concentrations was observed in this case the sediment metal concentrations decreased more than 40 for ni 30 for cu 37 for cr and 19 for cd fig 2 to the contrary in sediment from site b corresponding to the less polluted area the phyt conditions presented the greater decrease of heavy metal concentrations 44 for pb 34 for cd 29 for cu and 22 for ni lead was an exception to this trend pb was extracted by s fruticosa just when assisted with the yeast in this case the pb reduction was 67 fig 2 3 3 bioconcentration factor bcf and translocation factor tf in sarcocornia fruticosa bioremediation treatments using only plant or the plant with the metal resistant yeast fig 2 showed different profiles of heavy metal concentration decrease after 15 days of incubation depending on the initial heavy metal concentrations in the sediments in site a more polluted area the inoculation with the isolated yeast enhanced plant bioaccumulation for cd bcf 18 fig 3 and decreased for ni and particularly for pb however the low tf values obtained showed that cd is not translocated to the aerial organs and it is stored in the roots fig 3 despite high concentrations of heavy metals accumulated in the roots of s fruticosa these concentrations were not observed in the aerial organs indicating that metal translocation was prevented in case of higher heavy metal sediment contamination results showed that in lower heavy metal contaminated sediments from site b values of bcf are greater using only the plant the bcf quantified was 1 just for 3 metals 3 5 for cu 3 2 for ni 1 8 for cr 1 8 fig 4 the inoculation of s fruticosa rhizosphere with the metal resistant isolated yeast decreased the bcf and the tf in case of pb the tf of s fruticosa alone was higher in sediment from site b than obtained in sediments from site a more polluted suggesting the influence of pollution level on the pb translocation capacity 4 discussion various factors may affect the solubility and availability of metals in saltmarsh sediments and vegetation including concentration and speciation of metals and characteristics of the sediment the characteristics of the sediment are influenced by redox potential organic matter content biotic aspects concentrations of inorganic and organic ligands including plants exudates cation exchange capacity among other factors in turn these factors may influence the mutual interactions between plants and the surrounding chemical environment determining the role played by plants on trace metal distribution and uptake these roles may vary among plant species and holding species constant may vary among locations with different characteristics reboreda and caçador 2007 popenda 2014 moreira da silva et al 2015 in the present study all sediments that had an approximately neutral ph ph 6 7 2 were in a reduced state eh 27 159mv and had a wide range of organic matter content from 3 to 19 organic matter may play an important role as metals can be sorbed on organic matter alongi et al 1996 jansen et al 2001 popenda 2014 examined the effect of redox changes on the mobility of cr cu pb zn and as in sample of five dredged sediments originating from disposal sites in the netherlands this study showed that an increase in the redox potential above 400mv up to 503mv resulted in an increase in solubility 1 of cr cu pb and zn in all sediments and had a large effect 40 80 on the oxidation of reduced sulfur compounds to so4 2 several previous works showed that halophyte vegetation can sequester and inherently tolerate the high metal concentrations found in saltmarsh sediments caetano et al 2008 reboreda and caçador 2007 moreira da silva et al 2015 an increasing number of studies have been carried out to understand the role of these species on retention bioavailability and remediation of the pollutants in coastal areas caetano et al 2008 rai 2008 almeida et al 2011 moreira da silva et al 2015 moreira da silva et al 2013 investigated the role of s fruticosa on the presence and distribution of trace elements ag cd cu cr mo ni pb and zn amongst sediment and plant tissues in ria fomosa lagoon the study demonstrated that s fruticosa could fix metals from the surrounding belowground environment and accumulate them mainly in roots metal translocation to aerial parts of the plants was in general residual in fact metal concentrations in roots were greater than in the aboveground organs of the plant and this provides evidence of the weak translocation caetano et al 2008 reboreda and caçador 2007 our results showed two different behavior patterns of s fruticosa depending on metal concentrations in saltmarsh sediments in sediments with higher contamination levels inoculation with yeast resulted in an increase of phytoremediation capacity inoculation of the isolated yeast enhanced plant bioaccumulation for cd in roots with no translocation to aerial organs of the plant we hypothesise that s cerevisiae can improve cd phytostabilization by s fruticosa in sediments that are heavily contaminated with metals however in less contaminated environment s fruticosa alone showed best results these data were in concordance with liang et al 2017 who showed that when juncus maritimus and phragmites australis rhizospheres were inoculated with a microbial consortium containing cd resistant microorganisms the total amount of cd increased up to seven times in phragmites australis stems and up to 48 in juncus maritimus belowground structures in fact there are certain limitations to phytoremediation system among these limitations are chemistry and the level of contamination the impacts on vegetation and climatic conditions tangahu et al 2011 many phytoremediation projects demonstrated the inefficiency of solely using plants for heavy metal removal mainly in cases of high heavy metal contamination levels liang et al 2017 and the importance of supplementary methods such as microbe assisted phytoremediation hechmi et al 2014 the use of plants and their associated microorganisms for the removal of contaminants from the environment is based on the increase of microbial population numbers in the rhizosphere and or endosphere and on the stimulation of their metabolic activity kuiper et al 2004 microorganisms can influence the mobility of metals in the sediment either by accumulation or by producing substances such as organic compounds or sulphides that directly change metal mobility liang et al 2017 therefore microbe assisted phytoremediation represents a powerful emerging approach to sequester degrade transform assimilate metabolize or detoxify contaminants from soil sediment or groundwater moreira et al 2006 dary et al 2010 ma et al 2016 navya et al 2015 in our case a possible explanation of the pattern observed in sediments with higher contamination levels could be due to the heavy metal biosorption capacities of s cerevisiae as demonstrated in many studies volesky and may phillips 1995 wang and chen 2006 our results showed that differential metal reductions can be achieved depending on the level of heavy metal contamination contrary to microorganisms high heavy metal concentrations may inhibit plant growth and thus may limit phytoremediation application this can be related to phytotoxicity tangahu et al 2011 in their study on competitive biosorption of pb cd cu and as ions using algae sulaymon et al 2013 showed that the percentage removal does not alter greatly if the concentration increases from 10 to 50mgl 1 but when the concentrations increase to 100 and 200mgl 1 that the depletion in percentage removal will be pronounced this may be explained by the fact that 1g of algae may contain enough exchangeable sites for the lower concentration range but the exchangeable sites in 1g will not be enough to cover these concentrations romera et al 2008 however the performance of s cerevisiae to remove heavy metals seemed to be independent of initial concentration as showed by farhan and khadom 2015 and in contrast to the results obtained from plants the yeast metal biosorption has been observed to increase as initial concentration increases paravathi et al 2006 farhan and khadom 2015 fadel et al 2017 this may be attributed to the active binding sites available for available sorbate ions fadel et al 2017 in terms of plant behavior in the more polluted area site a the inoculation with the isolated yeast enhanced plant bioaccumulation for cd as well as the efficiency of phytoremediation as illustrated in many works plant associated microorganisms can be exploited to improve the efficiency of phytoremediation processes sessitsch et al 2013 sangthong et al 2015 tiwari and lata 2018 similar results have also obtained by nunes et al 2014 that demonstrated that the cd phytostabilization potential for two aquatic plants juncus maritimus and phragmites australis was increased when the rhizosphere was inoculated with autochthonous microbial consortium boechat et al 2017 showed that metal resistant rhizobacteria improved phytoextraction of mucuna deeringiana in soils contaminated with multiple metals from a gold mining area the same behavior was demonstrated by ma et al 2016 with respect to cd zn and pb contamination inoculating metal hyperaccumulating plants with their own selected functional endophytic bacterial strains also sangthong et al 2015 demonstrated that micrococcus sp tistr2221 significantly increased cd accumulation in the roots and shoots of z mays l compared to uninoculated plants however in the less polluted area site b the metal phytoremediation ability was demonstrated by bcf greater than one for cu ni and cr using only the plant remediation in this case high tf to pb was observed this makes evident the natural potential of s fruticosa to transport pb to aerial organs and consequently to its phytoextraction and illustrates the efficiency of phytoremediation in sediments moderately contaminated with heavy metals d souza et al 2013 in fact translocation of metals to aerial organs is an important biochemical process and desirable for effective phytoextraction as highlighted by dixit et al 2015 a high concentration of heavy metals accumulated in plants causes irreversible damage to plant tissues resulting in plant growth retardation barocsi et al 2003 to improve phytoextraction performance plant growth rate should be promoted sangthong et al 2015 and so the need of microbe augmentation assisted phytoextraction in high heavy metal contaminated sediments teixeira et al 2014 the phytoextraction process may be enhanced by soil amendments that increase trace element availability in the soil sessitsch et al 2013 in general halophytes plants respond to heavy metal toxicity via several molecular mechanisms liang et al 2017 these include i metal ions binding to cell walls ii metals chelating within cytosol iii ros defense mechanisms and iv metal sequestration in vacuoles ali et al 2013 kushwaha et al 2016 the cell wall plays an important role in metal storage in plants maestri et al 2010 and in the immobilization of metal ions dalcorso et al 2013 storage and concomitant detoxification of excess heavy metals generally occurs within the vacuole martinoia et al 2007 the presence of metals in roots results from physical adsorption being well established that heavy metals may bind to pectic substances and hemicellulose of cell walls due to electrostatic bonding khotimchenko et al 2007 hu et al 2010 lutts et al 2016 studies with halimione portulacoides a dicotyledon halophyte as s fruticosa showed that metals such as zinc cadmium and nickel were mostly retained in the cell wall organelles particularly in the roots sousa et al 2008 however sesuvium portulacastrum was recognized as efficiently accumulating heavy metals such as chromium cadmium copper and zinc sodium and chloride mainly through the leaves when compared to stem and root ayyappan et al 2016 in general dicotyledons plants exhibit a high root cation exchange capacity holding high amounts of metals in free space and show higher uptake than monocotyledons carneiro et al 2001 nie et al 2017 found that the binding mechanism of uranium u vi of landoltia punctata in mine wastewater was due to a lamellar crystal insoluble nano u vi and u iv phosphate minerals such as chernikovite which might have resulted from the binding with phosphate groups among the promising biosorbents for heavy metal removal which have been researched during the past decades s cerevisiae has received increasing attention s cerevisiae is widely used in food and beverage production is easily cultivated using cheap media it is also a by product in large quantity as a waste of the fermentation industry and is easily manipulated at molecular level wang and chen 2006 many studies demonstrated that s cerevisiae biomass plays an important role in heavy metal biosorption it can accumulate metal ions such as cu2 cd2 pb2 or ni2 in biomass volesky and may phillips 1995 characteristics of s cerevisiae in heavy metal biosorption have been extensively discussed and metal binding capacity for various heavy metals has been well illustrated as in wang and chen 2006 karlberg et al 2002 showed that the crystal structures of ferrochelatase the terminal enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway from s cerevisiae complex with co ii and with two inhibitors cd ii and hg i moreover the co ii and cd ii complexes increase the metal binding in this study this potential was noticed as the inoculation by s cerevisiae contributed to increase the phytoremediation potential of s fruticosa for the metals in general however the percentage of decrease varied with the level of metal concentration in the sediment the addition of this autochthonous microorganism resistant to heavy metals seems to be a valuable strategy to potentiate phytoremediation in metal moderately contaminated saltmarshes 5 conclusions s cerevisiae has a potential for increasing the phytoremediation capacity of s fruticosa in saltmarshes with high heavy metal contamination and this is more evident for cd however in less heavy metal contaminated conditions the treatments using just s fruticosa showed higher heavy metal reduction that the ones inoculated with s cerevisiae s fruticosa acts as a natural phytostabilizer for cu ni cr and pb while the s cerevisiae inoculation enhanced cd phytostabilization by that halophyte specie the translocation capacity of s fruticosa was affected by the heavy metal contamination levels in sediments this was particularly noted for cd in less polluted conditions however plants will affect the soil through their ability to lower the ph and oxygenate the sediment which affects the availability of the metals increasing their bioavailability therefore in the further studies form and bioavailability of cd pb ni cr and cu in sediment should be analyzed conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to ethical standards acknowledgements none funding body none

that a fish species would occur in the river channel depending on field observation and authors experience 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the watershed of nestos river is a transboundary basin extending from rila mountain bulgaria to the aegean sea greece with a surface of 5479km2 and traveling a distance river length of 234km in the hellenic territory nestos basin occupies 2843km2 and traverses 130km through the rhodope mountain range to the sea ganoulis et al 2008 the use of water was regulated at an international level between greece and bulgaria following negotiations in 1975 1982 1988 and 1992 while in 1995 it was agreed that greece would be entitled to use 29 of nestos waters mylopoulos et al 2004 the flow of the greek part of nestos river is regulated by two major hydropower dams thissavros and platanovrisi and a minor irrigation dam toxotes located 30km upstream its mouth nestos delta and adjacent lagoons are included in the natura 2000 network both as special protection areas spa and sites of community importance sci and are part of the east macedonia thrace national park the nestos basin is mostly mountainous while its alluvial plain represents 18 2 of the total watershed area and is covered by arable agricultural land the irrigation network is served by toxotes dam and consists of two channels which distribute water to the east 11m3 s and west 9m3 s section of the plain kamidis 2011 the minimum flow arriving to the nestos delta was established legally at 6m3 s with the common ministerial decision 16492 19 10 1996 this study focused on a site 650m below toxotes dam which is representative of the downstream part of nestos river fig 1 this section of the river accumulates pressures from the operation of dams and endures stresses from agricultural abstractions moreover the selection of this sampling site ensured that the hydromorphology of the surveyed downstream habitats was influenced exclusively from the function of toxotes dam without other water gain or loss therefore estimating ecological flows for this river section will permit to quantify the amount of released water that is required for the whole downstream area and the delta 2 2 model theory mesohabsim is a methodological approach that models fluvial habitats it provides a habitat time series analysis and predicts the magnitude and duration of stressful events for fluvial fauna based on flow frequency patterns in different bioperiods parasiewicz 2008 it computes habitat availability for selected species under variable flows or other environmental parameters it is composed by three individual models parasiewicz 2007a 1 a hydromorphologic model that describes the fish relevant physical features of the spatial environment 2 a biological model describing the habitat use by the fish species 3 a habitat model quantifying the amounts of habitat usage and relating it to flow the hydromorphologic model is structured for fast data collection compared to other habitat models e g phabsim and it is based on a robust hydromorphological classification of river systems belletti et al 2017 this model quantifies biologically sound variables that were collected in the field and uses them as structural elements to describe different habitats for the development of the biological model presence and abundance of fish species were estimated using conditional models following the indications reported in parasiewicz et al 2013 in particular information obtained from previous studies carried by the authors and from a literature review on the selected target species were used to select range of velocities depths substrate conditions and cover attributes that have been determined as adequate for the species presence and abundance suitability hmu attribute values when hmu attributes from the field surveys fall within the specified ranges of the developed suitability values then the hmu was determined to be suitable or optimal for a particular species an example of conditional models for selected target species are reported in fig 2 and for clarity depicted using decision trees these conditional models built for target species and life stages were then validated by comparing their prediction with fish data collected in the field this validation performance of the predictive models was evaluated using four performance metrics i e accuracy sensitivity specificity and true skill statistic tss which are commonly used in ecological modeling vezza et al 2015b the latter tss allouche et al 2006 was used as performance metrics independent of model prevalence mouton et al 2010 next the habitat model analyzed how habitat suitability is affected by the river discharge at this step mesohabsim implements the sim stream software running in qgis zanin et al 2016 to combine hydro morphological data and biological models and applies habitat time series analysis to calculate uniform continuous under threshold ucut curves and to conduct habitat suitability predictions parasiewicz et al 2013 this software facilitates data management by offering to its user a comprehensible interface in gis environment finally in order to evaluate environmental thresholds the magnitude the duration and the frequency of low flow events were considered ucut curves represent projected contours of a habitat area in a three dimensional space x axis frequency y axis duration and z axis habitat area they refer to a particular bioperiod and were implemented to examine the duration and frequency of continuous events with habitat lower than a specified threshold thus the total length of all events of the same duration within bioperiods was computed as a ratio of a total duration of all bioperiods in the record and the proportions are plotted as a cumulative frequency vezza et al 2014 as example of applications the mesohabsim approach was used to identify the optimal flow for the protection of dwarf wedge mussel alasmidonta heterodon in upper delaware river parasiewicz et al 2016 to model habitat requirements of bullhead cottus gobio in alpine streams vezza et al 2013 and to model habitat availability in high gradient streams vezza et al 2014 detailed information and functions of mesohabsim model can be found in parasiewicz 2001 2007a b and vezza et al 2014 2 3 data collection the main purpose of the sampling effort was to examine the study area under different discharge conditions in terms of fish abundance hydrological attributes instream morphology and spatial extent thus the application of mesohabsim required the collection of biological hydrological and morphological data under different discharge values however abrupt diurnal variations boskidis 2011 of the discharge due to the operation of the hydropower dams imposed the samplings to be organized according to a range of discharge values table 1 instead of absolute values discharge measurements in the studied section of the river were conducted before and after each sampling in order to confirm that a specific discharge class was represented in addition discharge data was obtained from a water level sensor installed at the sampling area this sensor was recording the water level every 15min so this dense flow time series ensures that a specific discharge class per sampling effort was maintained the sampling site was divided to hydro morphologically discrete subareas geomorphic units belletti et al 2017 for each discharge rate by considering flow velocity depth and fluvial planforms table 2 such unique instream subareas are documented as channel geomorphic units or hydro morphological units hmus and correspond in size and location to mesohabitats parasiewicz 2007a belletti et al 2017 collection of biological data was performed with a backpack electrofishing device hans grassl elt60 iihi electrofishing was selected as the most appropriate technique since it is considered as an unbiased method and reduces fish sample mortality when correctly applied imbriw 2013 biological sampling was organized per hmu and targeted four endemic fish species the strumica barbel barbus strumicae karaman 1955 the orpheus chub squalius orpheus kottelat and economidis 2006 the european bitterling rhodeus amarus bloch 1782 and the strymon spirlin alburnoides strymonicus chichkoff 1940 the strumica barbel and the european bitterling are included in the habitats directive 92 43 eec and thus protected by european legislation electrofishing was performed in all hmus in an effort to identify all suitable habitats for the four aforementioned species and record the hydrological and morphological characteristics all collected individuals were classified per species and their total length tl mm was measured before being released back to the river hydrological and morphological data were collected and recorded in a geodatabase by implementing mobile mapping techniques vezza 2010 for the geodatabase recording a mobile mapping system consisting of a laser rangefinder lti trupulse 360r a rugged gnss data collector chc lt 500u and a mobile geographic information system gis software were used this technique allows to its user to topographically define the sampled hmus as polygon shapefiles on a map and to instantly register all the desired morphological parameters in their attribute tables in total 9 independent predictors were recorded in the field with regard to biological needs of targeted fish species table 3 for each hmu the flow velocity m s was measured in at least 10 points using a propeller flow probe global water fp101 flow probe at the same points the water depth and the substrate composition were recorded substrate ingredients were classified by granulometry measurements according to hauer et al 2006 spatial and hydro morphological information was further examined and organized with gis software qgis development team 2009 to produce detailed maps of the aquatic habitat in the study area finally a daily average discharge time series from upstream and downstream of toxotes dam was introduced to the model in order to simulate habitat alterations at the downstream part this validated daily time series for the period october 2006 may 2008 was provided by boskidis et al 2012 this time series was the only available daily continuous discharge dataset and included both yearly maximum and minimum discharge values observed in nestos river it also provides discharge values both for the upstream and downstream part of the toxotes dam which is a prerequisite for describing reference and altered conditions 3 results overall 81 mesohabitats were sampled during 18 surveys from may to september 2016 samplings were conducted within a discharge value ranging from 5 to 42m3 s the wetted area for the sampling site varied between 11 092 6m2 5m3 s and 22 308 7m2 42m3 s fig 3 generally the prevalence of more dynamic hydro morphological types like glides and riffles was obvious under higher discharges while static types pools and backwaters were favored by lower discharge values biological samplings produced a dataset of 7532 fishes representing 13 species from 8 families cyprinidae was the most abundant family 6 species while families of anguillidae bleniidae cobitidae nemacheilidae percidae poeciliidae and salmonidae were represented by a single species each the most abundant species was b strumicae 56 17 while cobitis strumicae and a strymonicus were also common 17 68 and 13 38 respectively table 4 conditional models worked well to predict fish distribution presence or abundance showing an overall accuracy from 76 to 84 and a true skill statistics from 0 54 to 0 68 habitat suitability variation in terms of available suitable and optimal habitat area is displayed in table 5 this table considers the habitat extent as a percentage of the wetted area under the discharge class of 42m3 s which was the highest measured flow rate and related to the maximum wetted area mwa registered in the field this analysis revealed an impressive increase of available suitable and optimal habitat for almost all target species and age categories when discharge increased from 5 to 12m3 s more specifically available habitat for both a strymonicus juveniles and adults doubled from 15 4 to 30 4 of mwa and from 16 8 to 31 8 of mwa respectively available habitat for b strumicae juveniles also doubled from 16 6 to 34 9 of mwa while it dramatically increased for b strumicae adults from 8 6 to 44 7 of mwa equally r amarus which was examined as a single age class experienced an important increase of habitat from 17 3 to 23 8 of mwa respectively available habitat for s orpheus juveniles nearly doubled from 15 6 to 26 5 of mwa while it vastly augmented for s orpheus adults from 8 7 to 35 2 of mwa as discharge increased from 12 to 22m3 s the available habitat increment continued but at a less pronounced rate as discharge continued to rise 22m3 s the amount of available habitat reduced for most species some exceptions to these trends were observed in suitable habitat figures e g reduction of suitable habitat for juvenile a strymonicus and b strumicae adults but they represent a minor proportion and the described trend is considered as dominant since this study was conducted under multiple discharge classes a range of ecological flows values was determined for nestos river these flow ranges satisfied the requirements of all four target species by shaping a suitable habitat minimum ecological flows were defined within the area of the habitat flow rating curve fig 4 where species habitat curves deflected gippel and stewardson 1998 as shown by the habitat flow curve with the exception of adult s orpheus and adult a strymonicus curves whose deflection points are located within the range of 20 25m3 s curves of b strumicae r amarus and juveniles of all target species displayed a deflection point within the range from 10 to 15m3 s below 10m3 s the available habitat for all target species vastly reduced these findings are highly supported by the increase of habitat for fishes revealed in table 5 and show that the maximum deviation in terms of habitat events below threshold was related to the ecological flows mesohabsim plotted the changes occurring in the available habitat over time which were examined by interpreting discharge fig 5 and habitat fig 6 time series for all target species habitat analysis at below threshold discharge values for nestos river e g q97 10 79m3 s for both reference upstream and altered downstream conditions was performed in terms of available habitat under threshold aq97 in m2 to this purpose uniform continuous under threshold ucut curves for reference and altered conditions were created and the habitat stress days alteration index isda was calculated to indicate the increase of habitat stress days in this study q97 was selected as a threshold for rare habitat events minimum amount of available habitat since it was the rare habitat threshold that better separates rare events from most persistent and common ones parasiewicz et al 2013 and it represented the minimum ecological flow rate selected to maintain fish populations in the river the habitat threshold for juveniles a strymonicus related to low discharge in reference conditions q97 was aq97 6132 6m2 the habitat stress days variation expressed as isda was 0 44 indicating an increase in the number of habitat stress days up to 44 due to the function of the dam the habitat threshold for a strymonicus adults related to low discharge in reference conditions q97 was aq97 6514 1m2 the habitat stress days variation expressed as isda was 1 6 indicating an increase in the number of habitat stress days up to 160 the habitat threshold for juveniles and adults b strumice related to low discharge in reference conditions q97 was aq97 6984 8m2 and 8399 2m2 respectively for both age categories the habitat stress days variation expressed as isda was 0 46 and 1 26 respectively indicating an increase in the number of habitat stress days up to 46 for juveniles and 126 for adult individuals similar information can be extracted from the ucut curves of s orpheus and r amarus more specifically for s orpheus juveniles and adults the habitat threshold related to low discharge in reference conditions q97 for juveniles and adults was measured at aq97 5432 1m2 and 6752 8m2 respectively while the habitat stress days variations isda were found at 0 67 and 1 6 indicating an increase in the number of habitat stress days up to 67 for s orpheus juveniles and 160 for adults finally the habitat threshold for r amarus one age class related to low discharge in reference conditions q97 was aq97 5012 7m2 the habitat stress days variation expressed as isda was 0 66 indicating an increase in the number of habitat stress days up to 66 4 discussion this study examined the ecohydrological status of nestos river in northern greece by attempting an innovative evaluation of the ecological flows the results showed a seasonal problem to maintain an adequate flow and habitat for fishes during low discharge events as a result of irrigation water abstractions in the alluvial plain a flow of at least 10m3 s downstream the toxotes dam is suggested in order to achieve a sustainable ecosystem and meet the standards established by the wfd habitat time series analysis showed that fishes in the downstream part of the river experienced more stress days ranging from 44 to 160 more due to the function of the toxotes dam the most affected species seemed to be adult a strymonicus and adult s orpheus isda 1 6 mesohabitat survey was carried out using the mesohabsim approach and the hierarchical morphological unit classification belletti et al 2017 was the key element in order to describe how the habitat is currently varying with flow the assessed habitat conditions were used as a reference over time more dams and more water abstractions are currently planned in the upstream part of the nestos catchment and these new water uses will affect both the hydrological regime and the morphological river characteristics mertzanis and mertzanis 2013 river nestos already narrowed and deepened in the last few decades due to large dam contractions less sediment available for downstream reaches leaded to channel degradation wohl et al 2015 therefore the data collected in this study constitute a crucial starting point to monitor future morphological changes in terms of distribution and extent of geomorphic unit distribution and the related habitat availability the mesohabitat approach therefore can fit with the developed wfd methodologies for river hydromorphological assessment and monitoring and can provide good evaluation of habitat quality over time and over morphological river modifications rinaldi et al 2015 in addition habitat suitability models developed in this study can be the starting point of a large application of the mesohabsim model at the national scale further hydromorphological surveys fish data collection suitability model validation is indeed needed to understand the level of habitat alteration in greek rivers indeed there is the need to test the transferability potential of the developed conditionals models for fish is real in order to produce mesohabitat suitability models that can be applied at a catchment or at a regional scale vezza et al 2014 from a methodological point of view the mesohabsim approach demonstrated its flexibility to be applied in large braided rivers providing reliable and quantitative information on the real habitat available for the fish fauna in the studied reach the wfd requires a synthetic approach for the conservation of the aquatic systems while the habitats directive 92 43 eec requires the existence of specific environmental conditions for the protection of aquatic species eea 2010 2012 one of the required conditions is to maintain specific water flow conditions in order to safeguard species habitats since the over abstraction of water reduces the available amount of water for the species to sustain healthy populations and thus to the reduction of the biodiversity eea 2010 one method that allows to comply with these two directives is the determination of the ecological flows which according to dfo 2013 is defined as the flow regimes and water levels required to maintain the ecological functions that sustain fisheries associated with that water body and its habitat 5 conclusions in the current study a multidisciplinary analysis of the ecohydrological status of a 4th class was performed on a highly regulated mediterranean river in terms of habitat availability for fishes in its downstream section a habitat simulation approach was adopted to quantify variations of habitat and to finally suggest a minimum ecological flow which will ensure the viability of fishes populations to attain this goal the modernization of the existing irrigation network by establishing an underground irrigation system in the whole alluvial plain is imperative to adapt to a reducing water budget efficient practices in irrigation e g drop irrigation should expand across nestos alluvial plain and if necessary cultivated crops may change to less water demanding species as it concerns the upstream part the construction of the regulatory dam of temenos could reduce the negative impact of hydropeaking to downstream habitats by releasing water in a smoother way ultimately the water management plan should be revised by a committee of scientists stakeholders and authorities and applied with respect to the european obligations and rationalized stakeholders needs the transboundary status of nestos basin complicates decision making for water management in this framework a closer cooperation between the two countries is of high importance and the application of the same methodology to the bulgarian part of the river would allow the definition of the ecological flow in the whole river basin further research should focus on the simulation of a different ecohydrological status in nestos river by considering the construction of a regulatory dam the modernization of irrigation network and the application of efficient irrigation techniques under the pressure of a declining water budget moreover the impact of stressors on habitat should be assessed in terms of severity of low discharge events thus could be assessed the sustainability of a new water management plan by meeting the wfd requirements for

1102,preservation of a good ecological status in riverine habitats emerged as a priority for water management policies in europe since the negative impact caused by the construction and operation of dams on the ecohydrology and habitat availability became more evident ecological flows as reported in the recently published european guidance represent a link between water and habitat eu directives this study presents the application of a mesohabitat simulation model mesohabsim to evaluate and quantify ecological flows in a highly regulated mediterranean watershed nestos river northern greece data collection was performed through gis gps mapping surveys hydro morphological measurements water depth flow substratum type etc and electrofishing samplings at mesohabitat scale under different discharge conditions in total 81 hydro morphological units were surveyed and 7532 fish samples were collected to develop habitat suitability predictions ecological flows were calculated in the range 10 15m3 s as the required discharge which assures the welfare and sustainability of protected fish species populations in the lower course of the nestos river habitat time series indicated irrigation

example of conditional models for selected target species are reported in fig 2 and for clarity depicted using decision trees these conditional models built for target species and life stages were then validated by comparing their prediction with fish data collected in the field this validation performance of the predictive models was evaluated using four performance metrics i e accuracy sensitivity specificity and true skill statistic tss which are commonly used in ecological modeling vezza et al 2015b the latter tss allouche et al 2006 was used as performance metrics independent of model prevalence mouton et al 2010 next the habitat model analyzed how habitat suitability is affected by the river discharge at this step mesohabsim implements the sim stream software running in qgis zanin et al 2016 to combine hydro morphological data and biological models and applies habitat time series analysis to calculate uniform continuous under threshold ucut curves and to conduct habitat suitability predictions parasiewicz et al 2013 this software facilitates data management by offering to its user a comprehensible interface in gis environment finally in order to evaluate environmental thresholds the magnitude the duration and the frequency of low flow events were considered ucut curves represent projected contours of a habitat area in a three dimensional space x axis frequency y axis duration and z axis habitat area they refer to a particular bioperiod and were implemented to examine the duration and frequency of continuous events with habitat lower than a specified threshold thus the total length of all events of the same duration within bioperiods was computed as a ratio of a total duration of all bioperiods in the record and the proportions are plotted as a cumulative frequency vezza et al 2014 as example of applications the mesohabsim approach was used to identify the optimal flow for the protection of dwarf wedge mussel alasmidonta heterodon in upper delaware river parasiewicz et al 2016 to model habitat requirements of bullhead cottus gobio in alpine streams vezza et al 2013 and to model habitat availability in high gradient streams vezza et al 2014 detailed information and functions of mesohabsim model can be found in parasiewicz 2001 2007a b and vezza et al 2014 2 3 data collection the main purpose of the sampling effort was to examine the study area under different discharge conditions in terms of fish abundance hydrological attributes instream morphology and spatial extent thus the application of mesohabsim required the collection of biological hydrological and morphological data under different discharge values however abrupt diurnal variations boskidis 2011 of the discharge due to the operation of the hydropower dams imposed the samplings to be organized according to a range of discharge values table 1 instead of absolute values discharge measurements in the studied section of the river were conducted before and after each sampling in order to confirm that a specific discharge class was represented in addition discharge data was obtained from a water level sensor installed at the sampling area this sensor was recording the water level every 15min so this dense flow time series ensures that a specific discharge class per sampling effort was maintained the sampling site was divided to hydro morphologically discrete subareas geomorphic units belletti et al 2017 for each discharge rate by considering flow velocity depth and fluvial planforms table 2 such unique instream subareas are documented as channel geomorphic units or hydro morphological units hmus and correspond in size and location to mesohabitats parasiewicz 2007a belletti et al 2017 collection of biological data was performed with a backpack electrofishing device hans grassl elt60 iihi electrofishing was selected as the most appropriate technique since it is considered as an unbiased method and reduces fish sample mortality when correctly applied imbriw 2013 biological sampling was organized per hmu and targeted four endemic fish species the strumica barbel barbus strumicae karaman 1955 the orpheus chub squalius orpheus kottelat and economidis 2006 the european bitterling rhodeus amarus bloch 1782 and the strymon spirlin alburnoides strymonicus chichkoff 1940 the strumica barbel and the european bitterling are included in the habitats directive 92 43 eec and thus protected by european legislation electrofishing was performed in all hmus in an effort to identify all suitable habitats for the four aforementioned species and record the hydrological and morphological characteristics all collected individuals were classified per species and their total length tl mm was measured before being released back to the river hydrological and morphological data were collected and recorded in a geodatabase by implementing mobile mapping techniques vezza 2010 for the geodatabase recording a mobile mapping system consisting of a laser rangefinder lti trupulse 360r a rugged gnss data collector chc lt 500u and a mobile geographic information system gis software were used this technique allows to its user to topographically define the sampled hmus as polygon shapefiles on a map and to instantly register all the desired morphological parameters in their attribute tables in total 9 independent predictors were recorded in the field with regard to biological needs of targeted fish species table 3 for each hmu the flow velocity m s was measured in at least 10 points using a propeller flow probe global water fp101 flow probe at the same points the water depth and the substrate composition were recorded substrate ingredients were classified by granulometry measurements according to hauer et al 2006 spatial and hydro morphological information was further examined and organized with gis software qgis development team 2009 to produce detailed maps of the aquatic habitat in the study area finally a daily average discharge time series from upstream and downstream of toxotes dam was introduced to the model in order to simulate habitat alterations at the downstream part this validated daily time series for the period october 2006 may 2008 was provided by boskidis et al 2012 this time series was the only available daily continuous discharge dataset and included both yearly maximum and minimum discharge values observed in nestos river it also provides discharge values both for the upstream and downstream part of the toxotes dam which is a prerequisite for describing reference and altered conditions 3 results overall 81 mesohabitats were sampled during 18 surveys from may to september 2016 samplings were conducted within a discharge value ranging from 5 to 42m3 s the wetted area for the sampling site varied between 11 092 6m2 5m3 s and 22 308 7m2 42m3 s fig 3 generally the prevalence of more dynamic hydro morphological types like glides and riffles was obvious under higher discharges while static types pools and backwaters were favored by lower discharge values biological samplings produced a dataset of 7532 fishes representing 13 species from 8 families cyprinidae was the most abundant family 6 species while families of anguillidae bleniidae cobitidae nemacheilidae percidae poeciliidae and salmonidae were represented by a single species each the most abundant species was b strumicae 56 17 while cobitis strumicae and a strymonicus were also common 17 68 and 13 38 respectively table 4 conditional models worked well to predict fish distribution presence or abundance showing an overall accuracy from 76 to 84 and a true skill statistics from 0 54 to 0 68 habitat suitability variation in terms of available suitable and optimal habitat area is displayed in table 5 this table considers the habitat extent as a percentage of the wetted area under the discharge class of 42m3 s which was the highest measured flow rate and related to the maximum wetted area mwa registered in the field this analysis revealed an impressive increase of available suitable and optimal habitat for almost all target species and age categories when discharge increased from 5 to 12m3 s more specifically available habitat for both a strymonicus juveniles and adults doubled from 15 4 to 30 4 of mwa and from 16 8 to 31 8 of mwa respectively available habitat for b strumicae juveniles also doubled from 16 6 to 34 9 of mwa while it dramatically increased for b strumicae adults from 8 6 to 44 7 of mwa equally r amarus which was examined as a single age class experienced an important increase of habitat from 17 3 to 23 8 of mwa respectively available habitat for s orpheus juveniles nearly doubled from 15 6 to 26 5 of mwa while it vastly augmented for s orpheus adults from 8 7 to 35 2 of mwa as discharge increased from 12 to 22m3 s the available habitat increment continued but at a less pronounced rate as discharge continued to rise 22m3 s the amount of available habitat reduced for most species some exceptions to these trends were observed in suitable habitat figures e g reduction of suitable habitat for juvenile a strymonicus and b strumicae adults but they represent a minor proportion and the described trend is considered as dominant since this study was conducted under multiple discharge classes a range of ecological flows values was determined for nestos river these flow ranges satisfied the requirements of all four target species by shaping a suitable habitat minimum ecological flows were defined within the area of the habitat flow rating curve fig 4 where species habitat curves deflected gippel and stewardson 1998 as shown by the habitat flow curve with the exception of adult s orpheus and adult a strymonicus curves whose deflection points are located within the range of 20 25m3 s curves of b strumicae r amarus and juveniles of all target species displayed a deflection point within the range from 10 to 15m3 s below 10m3 s the available habitat for all target species vastly reduced these findings are highly supported by the increase of habitat for fishes revealed in table 5 and show that the maximum deviation in terms of habitat events below threshold was related to the ecological flows mesohabsim plotted the changes occurring in the available habitat over time which were examined by interpreting discharge fig 5 and habitat fig 6 time series for all target species habitat analysis at below threshold discharge values for nestos river e g q97 10 79m3 s for both reference upstream and altered downstream conditions was performed in terms of available habitat under threshold aq97 in m2 to this purpose uniform continuous under threshold ucut curves for reference and altered conditions were created and the habitat stress days alteration index isda was calculated to indicate the increase of habitat stress days in this study q97 was selected as a threshold for rare habitat events minimum amount of available habitat since it was the rare habitat threshold that better separates rare events from most persistent and common ones parasiewicz et al 2013 and it represented the minimum ecological flow rate selected to maintain fish populations in the river the habitat threshold for juveniles a strymonicus related to low discharge in reference conditions q97 was aq97 6132 6m2 the habitat stress days variation expressed as isda was 0 44 indicating an increase in the number of habitat stress days up to 44 due to the function of the dam the habitat threshold for a strymonicus adults related to low discharge in reference conditions q97 was aq97 6514 1m2 the habitat stress days variation expressed as isda was 1 6 indicating an increase in the number of habitat stress days up to 160 the habitat threshold for juveniles and adults b strumice related to low discharge in reference conditions q97 was aq97 6984 8m2 and 8399 2m2 respectively for both age categories the habitat stress days variation expressed as isda was 0 46 and 1 26 respectively indicating an increase in the number of habitat stress days up to 46 for juveniles and 126 for adult individuals similar information can be extracted from the ucut curves of s orpheus and r amarus more specifically for s orpheus juveniles and adults the habitat threshold related to low discharge in reference conditions q97 for juveniles and adults was measured at aq97 5432 1m2 and 6752 8m2 respectively while the habitat stress days variations isda were found at 0 67 and 1 6 indicating an increase in the number of habitat stress days up to 67 for s orpheus juveniles and 160 for adults finally the habitat threshold for r amarus one age class related to low discharge in reference conditions q97 was aq97 5012 7m2 the habitat stress days variation expressed as isda was 0 66 indicating an increase in the number of habitat stress days up to 66 4 discussion this study examined the ecohydrological status of nestos river in northern greece by attempting an innovative evaluation of the ecological flows the results showed a seasonal problem to maintain an adequate flow and habitat for fishes during low discharge events as a result of irrigation water abstractions in the alluvial plain a flow of at least 10m3 s downstream the toxotes dam is suggested in order to achieve a sustainable ecosystem and meet the standards established by the wfd habitat time series analysis showed that fishes in the downstream part of the river experienced more stress days ranging from 44 to 160 more due to the function of the toxotes dam the most affected species seemed to be adult a strymonicus and adult s orpheus isda 1 6 mesohabitat survey was carried out using the mesohabsim approach and the hierarchical morphological unit classification belletti et al 2017 was the key element in order to describe how the habitat is currently varying with flow the assessed habitat conditions were used as a reference over time more dams and more water abstractions are currently planned in the upstream part of the nestos catchment and these new water uses will affect both the hydrological regime and the morphological river characteristics mertzanis and mertzanis 2013 river nestos already narrowed and deepened in the last few decades due to large dam contractions less sediment available for downstream reaches leaded to channel degradation wohl et al 2015 therefore the data collected in this study constitute a crucial starting point to monitor future morphological changes in terms of distribution and extent of geomorphic unit distribution and the related habitat availability the mesohabitat approach therefore can fit with the developed wfd methodologies for river hydromorphological assessment and monitoring and can provide good evaluation of habitat quality over time and over morphological river modifications rinaldi et al 2015 in addition habitat suitability models developed in this study can be the starting point of a large application of the mesohabsim model at the national scale further hydromorphological surveys fish data collection suitability model validation is indeed needed to understand the level of habitat alteration in greek rivers indeed there is the need to test the transferability potential of the developed conditionals models for fish is real in order to produce mesohabitat suitability models that can be applied at a catchment or at a regional scale vezza et al 2014 from a methodological point of view the mesohabsim approach demonstrated its flexibility to be applied in large braided rivers providing reliable and quantitative information on the real habitat available for the fish fauna in the studied reach the wfd requires a synthetic approach for the conservation of the aquatic systems while the habitats directive 92 43 eec requires the existence of specific environmental conditions for the protection of aquatic species eea 2010 2012 one of the required conditions is to maintain specific water flow conditions in order to safeguard species habitats since the over abstraction of water reduces the available amount of water for the species to sustain healthy populations and thus to the reduction of the biodiversity eea 2010 one method that allows to comply with these two directives is the determination of the ecological flows which according to dfo 2013 is defined as the flow regimes and water levels required to maintain the ecological functions that sustain fisheries associated with that water body and its habitat 5 conclusions in the current study a multidisciplinary analysis of the ecohydrological status of a 4th class was performed on a highly regulated mediterranean river in terms of habitat availability for fishes in its downstream section a habitat simulation approach was adopted to quantify variations of habitat and to finally suggest a minimum ecological flow which will ensure the viability of fishes populations to attain this goal the modernization of the existing irrigation network by establishing an underground irrigation system in the whole alluvial plain is imperative to adapt to a reducing water budget efficient practices in irrigation e g drop irrigation should expand across nestos alluvial plain and if necessary cultivated crops may change to less water demanding species as it concerns the upstream part the construction of the regulatory dam of temenos could reduce the negative impact of hydropeaking to downstream habitats by releasing water in a smoother way ultimately the water management plan should be revised by a committee of scientists stakeholders and authorities and applied with respect to the european obligations and rationalized stakeholders needs the transboundary status of nestos basin complicates decision making for water management in this framework a closer cooperation between the two countries is of high importance and the application of the same methodology to the bulgarian part of the river would allow the definition of the ecological flow in the whole river basin further research should focus on the simulation of a different ecohydrological status in nestos river by considering the construction of a regulatory dam the modernization of irrigation network and the application of efficient irrigation techniques under the pressure of a declining water budget moreover the impact of stressors on habitat should be assessed in terms of severity of low discharge events thus could be assessed the sustainability of a new water management plan by meeting the wfd requirements for instream habitats conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to ethical standards acknowledgements the authors thank the management

1103,using a referendum format contingent valuation survey we investigated the residents willingness to pay for restoring the water quality of the paraíba do sul river in the city of campos dos goytacazes brazil we estimated values for an environmental improvement consistent with the brazilian water legislation in order to facilitate the dialog among environmental scientists water users and policymakers among other stakeholders over the years residents have lost a great deal of water services due to residential industrial and agricultural pollution and our contingent scenario proposes water quality improvements that will restore those services findings indicate that local residents are willing to pay from 0 81 to 1 25 of the average reported income above their current water bill for restoring the paraíba do sul river depending on assumptions about response uncertainty keywords river restoration contingent valuation water quality water services brazil 1 introduction in many developing and developed countries rivers have been considerably polluted due to unplanned unprecedented agricultural industrial and urban growth as a result citizens have lost a valuable set of water services including irrigation and recreational opportunities in brazil the paraíba do sul pds river basin provides an example of water resources that are continuously subject to a considerable amount of pollution this catchment is an important resource for industrial irrigation systems production of electricity manufacturing and other economic sectors in the states of minas gerais são paulo and rio de janeiro the livelihood of many households depends directly on the pds river as they use it for drinking water systems fishery and irrigation of agricultural crops inappropriate agricultural practices deforestation residential wastewater disposal and industrial discharge have polluted the pds river with metals and organic contaminants see dittmar et al 2012 ovalle et al 2013 pereira et al 2006 silva et al 2001 consequently surrounding populations especially households located downstream have lost several water services that the pds river used to provide improving the river water quality may help mitigate health risks and restore water services that have been lost due to continuous pollution restoring rivers is costly and developing nations face many pressing needs that compete for budget priority e g poverty alleviation programs education health care drinking water and sanitation among others the lack of information regarding the economic value of river water quality improvements has been an impediment for making budget allocations to river restoration projects keeler et al 2015 economic valuation of river restoration projects has the potential to contribute to the determination of priorities by demonstrating the relative importance of rivers to surrounding populations it can also identify alternative sources of funding for environmental programs by quantifying the benefits that different stakeholders would derive from water quality improvements unfortunately few studies have investigated the economic value that local residents assign to potential improvements of the pds river basin among the exceptions rezende et al 2015 designed a choice experiment to investigate local residents willingness to pay for restoring the mangrove forest area in the pds river estuary their experiment included three levels of restoration minimal moderate and complete with specific improvements in ecological services and esthetic characteristics of the mangrove forest as well as different periods of time to achieve the proposed environmental improvements their results indicate that local residents willingness to pay for the restoration program increases with the level of restoration and decreases with the time needed to restore the mangrove forest area kahn et al 2017 also implemented a choice experiment to study local preferences for levels and time of restoration of the pds river the proposed restoration could take three levels minimal moderate and full which varied in terms of esthetic characteristics exposure risk ecological health and compliance with heavy metal and sediment standards they found that local residents have strong preferences for a rapid full restoration of the pds river rezende et al 2015 and kahn et al 2017 designed scenarios to help respondents to understand and value the proposed environmental improvements yet their studies do not describe the implications of the proposed improvements in terms of biological and chemical indicators this makes it difficult to estimate the cost of river restoration projects and to monitor the effectives of those projects in improving the pds river basin this study follows an alternative approach to define a river restoration program for the pds river that is consistent with legislation based water classifications our approach provides useful insights to design restoration programs for the pds river because the brazilian water legislation provides environmental benchmarks for scientists to monitor the progress of environmental programs and clearly identifies water services recovered with water quality improvements that residents can value in addition this study provides updated estimates of willingness to pay for restoring the pds river given that kahn et al 2017 provided estimates for a sample of respondents surveyed in 2006 specifically we implemented a referendum format contingent valuation survey to investigate residents willingness to pay for water services recovered by restoring the pds river up to a legislation based type ii classification in the city of campos dos goytacazes brazil results indicates that the inhabitants of campos dos goytacazes are willing to pay a considerable increase in their water bill at least 0 81 of the average household income for water quality improvements of the pds river the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a description of our study site the city of campos dos goytacazes and the paraíba do sul river section 3 describes the survey design including the cv question implemented to elicit respondents willingness to pay for improved water quality of the pds river section 4 presents the empirical strategy used to analyze the gathered data section 5 shows the survey results including willingness to pay estimates and determinants of local preferences for restoring the pds river section 6 concludes the paper with a discussion of results and some policy implications 2 characterization of the paraiba do sul river in campos dos goytacazes this study was conducted in the city of campos dos goytacazes hereafter referred to as campos located approximately 275km northeast the city of rio de janeiro with a land area of 4026km2 the last census indicated that the municipality of campos had a population of 463 731 inhabitants as of 2010 48 1 males and 51 9 females with more than 90 living in urban centers the average household had 3 24 members and earned a monthly income of 2251 reais r 1 1 the census information was retrieved from https cidades ibge gov br last accessed on november 14 2017 on average urban households earned a higher income than households in rural areas r 2372 vs r 1105 per month the pds river crosses the city almost at its center see fig 1 this river is among the most important catchments in brazil with an area of 57 000km2 and an extension of 1145km ana 2015 for campos the pds river is its primary water source for human consumption and other economic activities as many rivers in brazil the pds river is continuously polluted by the discharge of untreated residential wastewater and other effluents according to the 2015 national sanitation ranking the southeast region of brazil where the pds river is located only treats 47 of the wastewater on average the 100 largest brazilian cities only treat 50 of their effluents and only 10 of those cities treat up to 80 of the wastewater instituto trata brasil 2016 a number of prior studies have documented the hydro ecological and biogeochemical characteristics of the pds river e g almeida et al 2007 araujo et al 2015 carvalho et al 1999 carvalho et al 2002 marques et al 2017 ovalle et al 2013 those studies have reported high levels of organic and inorganic pollutants that put the health of surrounding populations at risk the pds river water quality is further jeopardized by the latent threat of environmental accidents for instance in april 2003 the pds suffered one of the most notable environmental incidents in brazil consisting of an uncontrolled paper mill effluent discharge hoag 2013 as a result approximately 600 000 inhabitants experienced water service interruptions for more than 10 days biota was decimated and the ecosystem disruption was incalculable the 184 municipalities located in the pds river basin contribute to its pollution and the city of campos is not the exception table 1 shows measures of total and fecal coliforms in the pds river waters before in and after the city of campos lamonica 2012 demonstrates that the amount of total and fecal coliforms increases as the river crosses campos before entering the city see site a in fig 1 the pds river shows fecal coliform levels according to type ii river waters 1 0 103 cfu 100ml as defined in the national environmental council s resolution no 357 conama 2005 2 2 in its resolution no 357 the national environmental council conama for its initials in portuguese provides a detailed guide to classify fresh and salt waters in brazil first this resolution classifies water bodies by their salinity as fresh water 0 5 brackish water 0 5 30 or marine water 30 then the resolution recognizes five types of freshwater special and types 1 4 in respective order of quality the resolution provides a number of biological and chemical standards for each type of freshwater see conama 2005 as well as a comprehensive list of services that each type of freshwater can provide see appendix a once the river enters the city fecal coliforms increase up to levels that surpass the legal standards for type ii river waters our own testing results shown in the last panel of table 1 are consistent with the findings of lamonica 2012 the concentration of fecal coliforms in sites 1 and 2 see fig 1 is of type ii waters however fecal coliform levels surpass the maximum established for type ii waters starting at site 3 which is an effluent of wastewater in another effluent of wastewater that is directly discharged in the river site 6 we found concentrations of fecal coliforms above 240 103 cfu 100ml the effluents of wastewater sites 3 and 6 in fig 1 also discharged chemical pollutants into the pds river see table 2 concentrations of organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorus in those sites are higher than the average registered since 1994 in a long term testing site in the same city site 5 in fig 1 moreover the levels of those pollutants surpass the legal standards for type ii river waters the chlorophyll concentrations in the long term testing site also exceed the legal standard for type ii waters particularly in dry periods where blooms of cyanobacteria anabaena sp are commonly observed as a result water supply is often interrupted for several days at that time of the year based on comparisons of those results with legal standards i e conama s resolution no 357 the pds river water can be classified as type iii 3 survey design and sampling strategy the survey based contingent valuation cv method has proven to be a viable approach for eliciting households willingness to pay for environmental improvements in developing and developed countries alike for instance alam 2013 in bangladesh bliem and getzner 2012 in austria lalika et al 2017 in tanzania lee 2012 in korea shang et al 2012 and zhao et al 2013 in china as well as brugnaro 2010 and peixer et al 2011 in brazil provide recent examples of cv studies implemented to value different services that rivers can provide the cv method consists of two parts 1 a hypothetical scenario that introduces an environmental change and 2 a follow up question that elicits respondents maximum willingness to pay or minimum willingness to accept for that environmental change birol et al 2006 eliciting respondents willingness to pay through the cv method requires careful survey design choice of survey mode and selection of the random sample bateman et al 2002 whittington 2002 in this study a collaborative team from fairfield university in usa and universidade estadual do norte fluminense in brazil designed and implemented an in person cv survey instrument the survey instrument included a number of sequential questions designed to clearly define the environmental change to be valued i e water quality improvements in the pds river first respondents were provided with information regarding the actual water quality of the river and were asked how credible they found that assessment the translated question read as follows recent studies conducted by researchers at uenf have shown that the pds river can be classified as type iii water according to brazilian legal standards this implies that the pds river can be used for human consumption only after conventional or advanced treatment irrigation for tree cereal and fodder crops recreational fishery indirect contact recreation and watering livestock using a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 means not credible and 5 means very credible how credible do you think the results of those studies are subsequently the valuation component of the survey was introduced following best practices the cv question was framed as a referendum where the respondent could vote for or against an environmental project that would improve the water quality of the pds river to fund the proposed project a monthly fee would be added to the water bill in the next 10 years this payment vehicle was chosen due to its practicality the project fee was randomly varied across respondents from r 5 to r 30 in increments of r 5 this exogenous variation in the project fee allows for estimating the household s willingness to pay the referendum format cv scenario initiated with a reminder about the current water quality of the pds river next the proposed project was presented with a detailed list of services that individuals would receive as a result of improving water quality up to a type ii classification according to the brazilian legislation the cv scenario also included a split sample treatment with variations in the time it would take to restore the river if the project was approved a 10 years and b 15 years these periods of time were chosen based on expectations of local scientists regarding the time it would take to restore the pds river with 10 years being an optimistic yet realistic scenario and 15 years being a more plausible case the cv scenario ended with a reminder that money spent on this additional fee will not be available for other household expenses the translated referendum voting question is as follows for the next question please assume that the population will have the opportunity to vote against or in favor of a restoration project for the paraíba do sul river currently that river cannot be safely used for swimming skiing diving irrigation of vegetables direct contact recreation or direct human consumption with the restoration project the pds river water quality will improve and the river will be safely used for swimming skiing diving irrigation of vegetables and direct contact recreation however it would not be recommended to drink water directly from the river studies conducted by uenf show that given the ecosystem s structure and uses it would take 10 15 years to reach the water quality improvements mentioned above to fund the project a monthly additional fee of r 5 10 15 20 25 30 would be introduced in the water bill of every household in campos for the next 10 years which would result in a total of 120 payments one per month keep in mind your household budget any amount of money given for the project will not be available for household expenses such as groceries cloth etc would you vote for or against the project the precision of cv estimates is often in question because respondents can exaggerate their willingness to pay in a hypothetical scenario while there is some evidence that the referendum format applied here may reduce hypothetical bias carson and groves 2007 it is not clear that this format alone can eliminate hypothetical bias little and berrens 2004 murphy et al 2005 blumenschein et al 2008 argue that wtp for a non market good can be precisely estimated by including a follow up question about the certainty of responses and argue that this approach is more effective in reducing the hypothetical bias than other approaches hence a follow up question about the certainty level of the referendum response was included respondents were asked about the certainty of their voting responses on the referendum question using a scale from one to five where one meant completely uncertain and five completely certain this follow up un certainty question was worded as follows in relation to the last question and based on a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 means completely uncertain and 5 means completely certain how certain are you of your response in person interviews are the most practical survey mode in developing countries yet some challenges were faced to conduct in person interviews because gated communities and apartment buildings with restricted access have proliferated in the city of campos in the last years those residents hardly grant access to unexpected visitors making it difficult for interviewers to reach them in addition other areas were inaccessible for interviewers due to safety concerns under these circumstances which are commonly observed in brazil prior valuation studies have conducted in person interviews at what brazilians refer to as democratic locations e g brugnaro 2010 rezende et al 2015 democratic locations are those points of interest that are frequented by all socio economic strata such as the central plazas malls and produce markets following this approach a total of 274 completed questionnaires were obtained 4 analytical framework and modeling approach this section provides a utility theoretic framework to analyze individuals responses to improvements in water quality of the pds river this framework assumes that the individual i s utility is a function of goods and services she consumes as well as personal characteristics hereafter denoted with the subscript i let v i y i w p z i represent the utility function of individual i utility levels increase with individual i s income y i and water services that the pds river provides w and decreases with prices of other goods p the individual utility is also affected by relevant personal attitudes and perceptions z i keeping everything else constant a water quality improvement of the pds river will increase the individual s utility because the amount of water services is expected to increase from its current level w 0 to a higher level w 1 given that utility decreases with income reductions i e payments the individual will be willing to pay for water quality improvements up to the extent that this payment does not decrease her utility below the original utility level thus an individual s maximum wtp for an improvement in water quality w 0 w 1 can be stated as follows 1 v i y i p w 0 z i v i y i wtp i p w 1 z i this implies that an individual s wtp for water services is a function of multidimensional water attributes income prices of other goods and her personal attitudes and perceptions in the referendum format an individual s willingness to pay for the proposed water quality improvements is not directly observed it is expected that response to the referendum question will be favorable i e response is yes only if wtp is greater than or equal to the program fee fee presented to the respondent otherwise the respondent is expected to vote against the project this can be represented by an indicator variable r 2 r 1 if wtp fee r 0 otherwise hence the probability of favorable responses is equal to the probability that wtp is greater than the project fee presented to respondents in the cv question i e p yes p wtp fee this equivalence allows for deriving wtp estimates from econometric models of binary responses to the cv question thus under the assumption that the error term e in eq 1 follows a logistic distribution responses to the cv question are investigated through logit models with the following specification 3 l n p y 1 p y δ fee x α e where p y is the probability of a positive response i e yes and x is a vector of covariates including a treatment indicator of restoration time 10 vs 15 years household income and control variables for attitudes and perceptions i e y z x the term e is a stochastic error that follows a logistic distribution δ and α are coefficients to be determined using a maximum likelihood estimation approach note that prices of other goods and services p are excluded from the empirical estimation because they are assumed to be constant across respondents the average wtp can be computed from coefficients in eq 3 as follows 4 wtp x α ˆ δ ˆ where x represents the vector of averages of independent variables α ˆ represents the estimated coefficients of independent variables other than fee and δ ˆ is the coefficient of fee wtp estimates could be upwardly biased due to the hypothetical nature of the cv question blumenschein et al 2008 and vossler et al 2003 among others propose correcting for response uncertainty to obtain more conservative and presumably realistic wtp estimates that approach is followed here in considering responses to the cv question as favorable only if the respondent answered yes to the referendum question r 1 and indicate a certainty level c of her voting response that is greater than or equal to a threshold value of certainty c ˆ that is a respondent s wtp is inferred through the recoding indicator r as follows 5 r 1 if r 1 and c c ˆ r 0 otherwise eqs 3 and 4 are estimated using the recoded responses in order to provide wtp estimates that are presumably unbiased table 3 presents the variables used to estimate logit models of voting responses according to the experimental design the variable fee depicts the individual s responsiveness to project fees and allows for eliciting the willingness to pay wtp for the proposed water quality improvement of the pds river i e w 0 w 1 given that those fees reduce household budget for other goods and services fee is expected to have a negative effect on the likelihood of voting in favor of the project the binary indicator restore is used to estimate effects of the length of restoration time 15 years relative to 10 years it can be hypothesized that restore will have a negative impact on the likelihood of voting in favor of the project because respondents may prefer to observe water quality improvements in the pds river sooner rather than later see meyer 2013 economic theory also indicates that household income y i is a relevant variable in consumption choices the variable income is expected to have a positive impact on the likelihood of voting in favor of the proposed project because the water services to be provided by improving the quality of the pds river would be beneficial for the household several variables are also included in the logit models to control for heterogeneous attitudes and perceptions among respondents z i for instance the binary indicators credible and consequential are included to control for the perceived credibility of information provided regarding the current water quality of the pds river and the perceived consequentiality of this study credible is expected to have a positive impact on the likelihood of voting for the project because individuals who believe that the pds river is contaminated would be more likely to pay for services that are currently considered lost consequential identifies respondents who believe that survey results can influence local authorities to implement the proposed project according to experimental and empirical evidence see carson et al 2014 herriges et al 2010 vásquez et al 2009 consequential is expected to have a positive impact on the likelihood of voting in favor of the project additionally socio demographic characteristics i e sex age education household size and time living in the study site are used to control for unobserved respondents attitudes and perceptions no prior expectations are held for those characteristics because they can be related to pertinent attitudes and perceptions in different forms 5 econometric results table 3 shows some descriptive statistics that provide a profile of the average respondent a majority of the respondents were females with an average age of 38 years more than 40 of respondents completed high school 28 had a college degree and 13 had some graduate education the average respondent has a household with at least three members a household income of r 3760 us 1100 per month and has lived in campos for more than 27 years females seem to be slightly overrepresented in our sample yet some sample characteristics are comparable to population attributes reported in the 2010 census see section 2 for instance the average number of household members is almost identical 3 19 vs 3 24 the average income of sampled households is also similar to the average monthly household income reported in the 2010 census adjusted by annual inflation which would be equivalent to r 3545 us 1037 as of 2016 table 4 presents marginal effects from two logit models estimated to identify factors underlying the decision to support the proposed water project those marginal effects can be interpreted as changes in the probability of voting in favor of the proposed project resulting from marginal changes in corresponding covariates model 1 is a more parsimonious model where treatment and respondents socio demographic characteristics are included model 2 is an extended specification that assumes that the perceived credibility of the water quality assessment and the perceived consequentiality of this study may also affect the individual s decision to vote in favor of the project the pseudo r 2 statistics and the akaike information criterion aic indicate that model 2 performs better than model 1 3 3 several pseudo r 2 statistics have been developed for logit models table 4 presents two of the most commonly used ones mcfadden s and the count pseudo r 2 in contrast the bayesian information criterion bic favors model 1 over model 2 it is worth noting that estimation results are robust across the model specifications and that those models yield similar wtp estimates as expected estimated coefficients on fee are negative and statistically significant at 10 level this result indicates that the likelihood of voting in favor of the proposed project decreases with additional fees to be charged for improved water quality of the pds river this finding is consistent with economic theory and yields support to the construct validity of our referendum cv scenario to value water quality improvements the split sample treatment indicator restore is statistically insignificant suggesting that respondents are indifferent between 10 and 15 years to achieve a type ii classification for the pds river prior studies have found that respondents are somewhat impatient in achieving river restorations kahn et al 2017 meyer 2013 in this study we did not find statistical evidence on local residents impatience to restore the pds river at least not for the window of time included in the cv scenario 10 vs 15 years results also indicate that the probability of a favorable vote decreases with respondent s age compared to younger individuals older people may believe that they will benefit from the proposed project during a shorter period of time therefore when discounting future benefits older people may find that those discounted benefits do not surpass the present value of project fees and consequently they are less likely to vote for the pds river restoration consistent with prior studies that indicate that perceived consequentiality of cv surveys have an effect on individuals willingness to pay e g carson et al 2014 herriges et al 2010 vásquez et al 2009 the estimated coefficient on consequential is positive and statistically significant at 10 level see model 2 this result suggests that respondents who believe that this study may influence policymakers to restore the pds river are more likely to vote for the proposed project than those respondents who do not believe so other covariates were found to be statistically insignificant table 5 shows the average wtp for water quality improvements with corresponding 95 confidence intervals calculated using krinsky and robb s 1986 boot strapping procedure with 5000 simulations model 1 indicates that the average individual would pay r 47 05 more in their monthly water bill for improving the water quality of the pds river up to a type ii classification model 2 yields a similar estimate of r 44 34 wtp estimates can be compared to the average monthly household income to explore the household s ability to pay a project fee the wtp estimate derived from model 1 is equivalent to 1 25 of the reported average monthly household income and the wtp estimate from model 2 is equivalent to 1 18 of that average income these estimates represent a small share of the household income which suggests that households would be able to afford paying a project fee of r 44 to r 47 as discussed above there is a persistent concern that wtp estimates derived using the cv method can be biased due to its hypothetical nature following blumenschein et al 2008 and vossler et al 2003 among others we estimated more conservative wtp estimates by recoding favorable responses to take the value of zero i e voting against the project if the respondent reported a low certainty level of one or two out of five regarding her vote response this certainty threshold is consistent with the median certainty level of three and the average level of 3 36 4 4 it is worth noting that average certainty levels remain between 3 1 and 3 6 across proposed project fees we found reported certainty levels to be disassociated from the proposed project fee χ 2 20 66 p value 0 417 based on this criterion a total of 26 positive responses were recoded as zero table 6 shows those wtp estimates the average respondent would pay between r 30 48 and r 34 32 for water quality improvements depending on the model used to estimate those values those estimates are equivalent to 0 81 and 0 91 of the average household income respectively 5 5 higher thresholds of certainty were investigated with a certainty threshold of four 91 responses were recoded as zero when the certainty threshold was increased to five 137 responses were changed to zero the high number of responses changed due to uncertainty suggests that certainty thresholds of four and five are too demanding for the voting behavior of our respondents therefore it is not surprising that wtp estimates are statistically insignificant when favorable voting responses are recorded using those certainty thresholds 6 discussion and conclusions this study investigated the willingness to pay for restoring the paraíba do sul river one of the most important catchments in brazil the proposed environmental improvement was based on the water classification defined in the brazilian water legislation our water testing results suggest that the pds river can be currently classified as type iii the contingent valuation scenario consists of improving the river water quality up to a type ii classification with this definition of the proposed environmental improvement this study will facilitate the dialog among different stakeholders given that the brazilian legislation clearly define biological and chemical benchmarks and water services for each water classification moreover willingness to pay estimates provided in this study demonstrate the relative importance of the pds river to local residents hence this study is policy relevant and a contribution to the growing literature on contingent valuation of environmental improvements in developing countries under the current classification the pds river waters cannot be safely used for swimming skiing diving irrigation of vegetables direct contact recreation or direct human consumption with the exception of direct human consumption those services would be restored if the pds river waters were improved up to a type ii classification using the contingent valuation method this study has estimated the value that campos residents would assign to water services regained through a restoration project for the pds river conservative estimates indicate that residents are willing to pay at least r 30 in a month for improving the pds river up to a type ii classification this estimate is equivalent to 0 81 of the average household income respondents were informed that those payments would occur monthly for the next 10 years i e 120 payments using a monthly discount rate of 2 as used in rezende et al 2015 the present value of those payments would be r 1382 43 if those estimates are aggregated over the number of households in campos estimated at 144 596 connections to the potable water system the discounted total benefits would be approximately r 199 9 million this estimate can be compared to total costs of the proposed project to assess its feasibility and prioritization among other environmental and social programs this study also tested some practical hypotheses for instance we investigated effects of the perceived consequentiality of our study on willingness to pay estimates carson et al 2014 herriges et al 2010 results indicate that respondents who believe that this study could have policy consequences are willing to pay a higher amount for restoring the pds river than respondents who do not believe so in addition we tested the hypothesis that willingness to pay estimates are responsive to the perceived credibility of water quality information provided in the cv survey no evidence was found to support this hypothesis finally a split sample treatment was designed to test the hypothesis that individuals are impatient in achieving environmental improvements kahn et al 2017 findings indicate that respondents are indifferent between achieving river restoration in 10 or 15 years it could be that the average respondent has an impatience threshold outside of that window of time for instance meyer 2013 found a rapid decay in perceived benefits from river improvements over time with a loss of half of the benefits when the proposed improvements take 5 years to occur investigating local time preferences over different periods of time to achieve river restoration would be

glucuronidase which is produced by escherichia coli for fecal coliform quantification we used the quanti tray with 49 large cavities and 48 small cavities after passing through a sealer the pack was incubated in an oven at a temperature of 35 c for a period of 24h then large and small cavities with total and fecal coliforms were counted the counts for fecal coliform are performed under uv light

1103,using a referendum format contingent valuation survey we investigated the residents willingness to pay for restoring the water quality of the paraíba do sul river in the city of campos dos goytacazes brazil we estimated values for an environmental improvement consistent with the brazilian water legislation in order to facilitate the dialog among environmental scientists water users and policymakers among other stakeholders over the years residents have lost a great deal of water services due to residential industrial and agricultural pollution and our contingent scenario proposes water quality improvements that will restore those services findings indicate that local residents are willing to pay from 0 81 to 1 25 of the average reported income above their current water bill for restoring the paraíba do sul river depending on assumptions about response uncertainty keywords river restoration contingent valuation water quality water services brazil 1 introduction in many developing and developed countries rivers have been considerably polluted due to unplanned unprecedented agricultural industrial and urban growth as a result citizens have lost a valuable set of water services including irrigation and recreational opportunities in brazil the paraíba do sul pds river basin provides an example of water resources that are continuously subject to a considerable amount of pollution this catchment is an important resource for industrial irrigation systems production of electricity manufacturing and other economic sectors in the states of minas gerais são paulo and rio de janeiro the livelihood of many households depends directly on the pds river as they use it for drinking water systems fishery and irrigation of agricultural crops inappropriate agricultural practices deforestation residential wastewater disposal and industrial discharge have polluted the pds river with metals and organic contaminants see dittmar et al 2012 ovalle et al 2013 pereira et al 2006 silva et al 2001 consequently surrounding populations especially households located downstream have lost several water services that the pds river used to provide improving the river water quality may help mitigate health risks and restore water services that have been lost due to continuous pollution restoring rivers is costly and developing nations face many pressing needs that compete for budget priority e g poverty alleviation programs education health care drinking water and sanitation among others the lack of information regarding the economic value of river water quality improvements has been an impediment for making budget allocations to river restoration projects keeler et al 2015 economic valuation of river restoration projects has the potential to contribute to the determination of priorities by demonstrating the relative importance of rivers to surrounding populations it can also identify alternative sources of funding for environmental programs by quantifying the benefits that different stakeholders would derive from water quality improvements unfortunately few studies have investigated the economic value that local residents assign to potential improvements of the pds river basin among the exceptions rezende et al 2015 designed a choice experiment to investigate local residents willingness to pay for restoring the mangrove forest area in the pds river estuary their experiment included three levels of restoration minimal moderate and complete with specific improvements in ecological services and esthetic characteristics of the mangrove forest as well as different periods of time to achieve the proposed environmental improvements their results indicate that local residents willingness to pay for the restoration program increases with the level of restoration and decreases with the time needed to restore the mangrove forest area kahn et al 2017 also implemented a choice experiment to study local preferences for levels and time of restoration of the pds river the proposed restoration could take three levels minimal moderate and full which varied in terms of esthetic characteristics exposure risk ecological health and compliance with heavy metal and sediment standards they found that local residents have strong preferences for a rapid full restoration of the pds river rezende et al 2015 and kahn et al 2017 designed scenarios to help respondents to understand and value the proposed environmental improvements yet their studies do not describe the implications of the proposed improvements in terms of biological and chemical indicators this makes it difficult to estimate the cost of river restoration projects and to monitor the effectives of those projects in improving the pds river basin this study follows an alternative approach to define a river restoration program for the pds river that is consistent with legislation based water classifications our approach provides useful insights to design restoration programs for the pds river because the brazilian water legislation provides environmental benchmarks for scientists to monitor the progress of environmental programs and clearly identifies water services recovered with water quality improvements that residents can value in addition this study provides updated estimates of willingness to pay for restoring the pds river given that kahn et al 2017 provided estimates for a sample of respondents surveyed in 2006 specifically we implemented a referendum format contingent valuation survey to investigate residents willingness to pay for water services recovered by restoring the pds river up to a legislation based type ii classification in the city of campos dos goytacazes brazil results indicates that the inhabitants of campos dos goytacazes are willing to pay a considerable increase in their water bill at least 0 81 of the average household income for water quality improvements of the pds river the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a description of our study site the city of campos dos goytacazes and the paraíba do sul river section 3 describes the survey design including the cv question implemented to elicit respondents willingness to pay for improved water quality of the pds river section 4 presents the empirical strategy used to analyze the gathered data section 5 shows the survey results including willingness to pay estimates and determinants of local preferences for restoring the pds river section 6 concludes the paper with a discussion of results and some policy implications 2 characterization of the paraiba do sul river in campos dos goytacazes this study was conducted in the city of campos dos goytacazes hereafter referred to as campos located approximately 275km northeast the city of rio de janeiro with a land area of 4026km2 the last census indicated that the municipality of campos had a population of 463 731 inhabitants as of 2010 48 1 males and 51 9 females with more than 90 living in urban centers the average household had 3 24 members and earned a monthly income of 2251 reais r 1 1 the census information was retrieved from https cidades ibge gov br last accessed on november 14 2017 on average urban households earned a higher income than households in rural areas r 2372 vs r 1105 per month the pds river crosses the city almost at its center see fig 1 this river is among the most important catchments in brazil with an area of 57 000km2 and an extension of 1145km ana 2015 for campos the pds river is its primary water source for human consumption and other economic activities as many rivers in brazil the pds river is continuously polluted by the discharge of untreated residential wastewater and other effluents according to the 2015 national sanitation ranking the southeast region of brazil where the pds river is located only treats 47 of the wastewater on average the 100 largest brazilian cities only treat 50 of their effluents and only 10 of those cities treat up to 80 of the wastewater instituto trata brasil 2016 a number of prior studies have documented the hydro ecological and biogeochemical characteristics of the pds river e g almeida et al 2007 araujo et al 2015 carvalho et al 1999 carvalho et al 2002 marques et al 2017 ovalle et al 2013 those studies have reported high levels of organic and inorganic pollutants that put the health of surrounding populations at risk the pds river water quality is further jeopardized by the latent threat of environmental accidents for instance in april 2003 the pds suffered one of the most notable environmental incidents in brazil consisting of an uncontrolled paper mill effluent discharge hoag 2013 as a result approximately 600 000 inhabitants experienced water service interruptions for more than 10 days biota was decimated and the ecosystem disruption was incalculable the 184 municipalities located in the pds river basin contribute to its pollution and the city of campos is not the exception table 1 shows measures of total and fecal coliforms in the pds river waters before in and after the city of campos lamonica 2012 demonstrates that the amount of total and fecal coliforms increases as the river crosses campos before entering the city see site a in fig 1 the pds river shows fecal coliform levels according to type ii river waters 1 0 103 cfu 100ml as defined in the national environmental council s resolution no 357 conama 2005 2 2 in its resolution no 357 the national environmental council conama for its initials in portuguese provides a detailed guide to classify fresh and salt waters in brazil first this resolution classifies water bodies by their salinity as fresh water 0 5 brackish water 0 5 30 or marine water 30 then the resolution recognizes five types of freshwater special and types 1 4 in respective order of quality the resolution provides a number of biological and chemical standards for each type of freshwater see conama 2005 as well as a comprehensive list of services that each type of freshwater can provide see appendix a once the river enters the city fecal coliforms increase up to levels that surpass the legal standards for type ii river waters our own testing results shown in the last panel of table 1 are consistent with the findings of lamonica 2012 the concentration of fecal coliforms in sites 1 and 2 see fig 1 is of type ii waters however fecal coliform levels surpass the maximum established for type ii waters starting at site 3 which is an effluent of wastewater in another effluent of wastewater that is directly discharged in the river site 6 we found concentrations of fecal coliforms above 240 103 cfu 100ml the effluents of wastewater sites 3 and 6 in fig 1 also discharged chemical pollutants into the pds river see table 2 concentrations of organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorus in those sites are higher than the average registered since 1994 in a long term testing site in the same city site 5 in fig 1 moreover the levels of those pollutants surpass the legal standards for type ii river waters the chlorophyll concentrations in the long term testing site also exceed the legal standard for type ii waters particularly in dry periods where blooms of cyanobacteria anabaena sp are commonly observed as a result water supply is often interrupted for several days at that time of the year based on comparisons of those results with legal standards i e conama s resolution no 357 the pds river water can be classified as type iii 3 survey design and sampling strategy the survey based contingent valuation cv method has proven to be a viable approach for eliciting households willingness to pay for environmental improvements in developing and developed countries alike for instance alam 2013 in bangladesh bliem and getzner 2012 in austria lalika et al 2017 in tanzania lee 2012 in korea shang et al 2012 and zhao et al 2013 in china as well as brugnaro 2010 and peixer et al 2011 in brazil provide recent examples of cv studies implemented to value different services that rivers can provide the cv method consists of two parts 1 a hypothetical scenario that introduces an environmental change and 2 a follow up question that elicits respondents maximum willingness to pay or minimum willingness to accept for that environmental change birol et al 2006 eliciting respondents willingness to pay through the cv method requires careful survey design choice of survey mode and selection of the random sample bateman et al 2002 whittington 2002 in this study a collaborative team from fairfield university in usa and universidade estadual do norte fluminense in brazil designed and implemented an in person cv survey instrument the survey instrument included a number of sequential questions designed to clearly define the environmental change to be valued i e water quality improvements in the pds river first respondents were provided with information regarding the actual water quality of the river and were asked how credible they found that assessment the translated question read as follows recent studies conducted by researchers at uenf have shown that the pds river can be classified as type iii water according to brazilian legal standards this implies that the pds river can be used for human consumption only after conventional or advanced treatment irrigation for tree cereal and fodder crops recreational fishery indirect contact recreation and watering livestock using a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 means not credible and 5 means very credible how credible do you think the results of those studies are subsequently the valuation component of the survey was introduced following best practices the cv question was framed as a referendum where the respondent could vote for or against an environmental project that would improve the water quality of the pds river to fund the proposed project a monthly fee would be added to the water bill in the next 10 years this payment vehicle was chosen due to its practicality the project fee was randomly varied across respondents from r 5 to r 30 in increments of r 5 this exogenous variation in the project fee allows for estimating the household s willingness to pay the referendum format cv scenario initiated with a reminder about the current water quality of the pds river next the proposed project was presented with a detailed list of services that individuals would receive as a result of improving water quality up to a type ii classification according to the brazilian legislation the cv scenario also included a split sample treatment with variations in the time it would take to restore the river if the project was approved a 10 years and b 15 years these periods of time were chosen based on expectations of local scientists regarding the time it would take to restore the pds river with 10 years being an optimistic yet realistic scenario and 15 years being a more plausible case the cv scenario ended with a reminder that money spent on this additional fee will not be available for other household expenses the translated referendum voting question is as follows for the next question please assume that the population will have the opportunity to vote against or in favor of a restoration project for the paraíba do sul river currently that river cannot be safely used for swimming skiing diving irrigation of vegetables direct contact recreation or direct human consumption with the restoration project the pds river water quality will improve and the river will be safely used for swimming skiing diving irrigation of vegetables and direct contact recreation however it would not be recommended to drink water directly from the river studies conducted by uenf show that given the ecosystem s structure and uses it would take 10 15 years to reach the water quality improvements mentioned above to fund the project a monthly additional fee of r 5 10 15 20 25 30 would be introduced in the water bill of every household in campos for the next 10 years which would result in a total of 120 payments one per month keep in mind your household budget any amount of money given for the project will not be available for household expenses such as groceries cloth etc would you vote for or against the project the precision of cv estimates is often in question because respondents can exaggerate their willingness to pay in a hypothetical scenario while there is some evidence that the referendum format applied here may reduce hypothetical bias carson and groves 2007 it is not clear that this format alone can eliminate hypothetical bias little and berrens 2004 murphy et al 2005 blumenschein et al 2008 argue that wtp for a non market good can be precisely estimated by including a follow up question about the certainty of responses and argue that this approach is more effective in reducing the hypothetical bias than other approaches hence a follow up question about the certainty level of the referendum response was included respondents were asked about the certainty of their voting responses on the referendum question using a scale from one to five where one meant completely uncertain and five completely certain this follow up un certainty question was worded as follows in relation to the last question and based on a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 means completely uncertain and 5 means completely certain how certain are you of your response in person interviews are the most practical survey mode in developing countries yet some challenges were faced to conduct in person interviews because gated communities and apartment buildings with restricted access have proliferated in the city of campos in the last years those residents hardly grant access to unexpected visitors making it difficult for interviewers to reach them in addition other areas were inaccessible for interviewers due to safety concerns under these circumstances which are commonly observed in brazil prior valuation studies have conducted in person interviews at what brazilians refer to as democratic locations e g brugnaro 2010 rezende et al 2015 democratic locations are those points of interest that are frequented by all socio economic strata such as the central plazas malls and produce markets following this approach a total of 274 completed questionnaires were obtained 4 analytical framework and modeling approach this section provides a utility theoretic framework to analyze individuals responses to improvements in water quality of the pds river this framework assumes that the individual i s utility is a function of goods and services she consumes as well as personal characteristics hereafter denoted with the subscript i let v i y i w p z i represent the utility function of individual i utility levels increase with individual i s income y i and water services that the pds river provides w and decreases with prices of other goods p the individual utility is also affected by relevant personal attitudes and perceptions z i keeping everything else constant a water quality improvement of the pds river will increase the individual s utility because the amount of water services is expected to increase from its current level w 0 to a higher level w 1 given that utility decreases with income reductions i e payments the individual will be willing to pay for water quality improvements up to the extent that this payment does not decrease her utility below the original utility level thus an individual s maximum wtp for an improvement in water quality w 0 w 1 can be stated as follows 1 v i y i p w 0 z i v i y i wtp i p w 1 z i this implies that an individual s wtp for water services is a function of multidimensional water attributes income prices of other goods and her personal attitudes and perceptions in the referendum format an individual s willingness to pay for the proposed water quality improvements is not directly observed it is expected that response to the referendum question will be favorable i e response is yes only if wtp is greater than or equal to the program fee fee presented to the respondent otherwise the respondent is expected to vote against the project this can be represented by an indicator variable r 2 r 1 if wtp fee r 0 otherwise hence the probability of favorable responses is equal to the probability that wtp is greater than the project fee presented to respondents in the cv question i e p yes p wtp fee this equivalence allows for deriving wtp estimates from econometric models of binary responses to the cv question thus under the assumption that the error term e in eq 1 follows a logistic distribution responses to the cv question are investigated through logit models with the following specification 3 l n p y 1 p y δ fee x α e where p y is the probability of a positive response i e yes and x is a vector of covariates including a treatment indicator of restoration time 10 vs 15 years household income and control variables for attitudes and perceptions i e y z x the term e is a stochastic error that follows a logistic distribution δ and α are coefficients to be determined using a maximum likelihood estimation approach note that prices of other goods and services p are excluded from the empirical estimation because they are assumed to be constant across respondents the average wtp can be computed from coefficients in eq 3 as follows 4 wtp x α ˆ δ ˆ where x represents the vector of averages of independent variables α ˆ represents the estimated coefficients of independent variables other than fee and δ ˆ is the coefficient of fee wtp estimates could be upwardly biased due to the hypothetical nature of the cv question blumenschein et al 2008 and vossler et al 2003 among others propose correcting for response uncertainty to obtain more conservative and presumably realistic wtp estimates that approach is followed here in considering responses to the cv question as favorable only if the respondent answered yes to the referendum question r 1 and indicate a certainty level c of her voting response that is greater than or equal to a threshold value of certainty c ˆ that is a respondent s wtp is inferred through the recoding indicator r as follows 5 r 1 if r 1 and c c ˆ r 0 otherwise eqs 3 and 4 are estimated using the recoded responses in order to provide wtp estimates that are presumably unbiased table 3 presents the variables used to estimate logit models of voting responses according to the experimental design the variable fee depicts the individual s responsiveness to project fees and allows for eliciting the willingness to pay wtp for the proposed water quality improvement of the pds river i e w 0 w 1 given that those fees reduce household budget for other goods and services fee is expected to have a negative effect on the likelihood of voting in favor of the project the binary indicator restore is used to estimate effects of the length of restoration time 15 years relative to 10 years it can be hypothesized that restore will have a negative impact on the likelihood of voting in favor of the project because respondents may prefer to observe water quality improvements in the pds river sooner rather than later see meyer 2013 economic theory also indicates that household income y i is a relevant variable in consumption choices the variable income is expected to have a positive impact on the likelihood of voting in favor of the proposed project because the water services to be provided by improving the quality of the pds river would be beneficial for the household several variables are also included in the logit models to control for heterogeneous attitudes and perceptions among respondents z i for instance the binary indicators credible and consequential are included to control for the perceived credibility of information provided regarding the current water quality of the pds river and the perceived consequentiality of this study credible is expected to have a positive impact on the likelihood of voting for the project because individuals who believe that the pds river is contaminated would be more likely to pay for services that are currently considered lost consequential identifies respondents who believe that survey results can influence local authorities to implement the proposed project according to experimental and empirical evidence see carson et al 2014 herriges et al 2010 vásquez et al 2009 consequential is expected to have a positive impact on the likelihood of voting in favor of the project additionally socio demographic characteristics i e sex age education household size and time living in the study site are used to control for unobserved respondents attitudes and perceptions no prior expectations are held for those characteristics because they can be related to pertinent attitudes and perceptions in different forms 5 econometric results table 3 shows some descriptive statistics that provide a profile of the average respondent a majority of the respondents were females with an average age of 38 years more than 40 of respondents completed high school 28 had a college degree and 13 had some graduate education the average respondent has a household with at least three members a household income of r 3760 us 1100 per month and has lived in campos for more than 27 years females seem to be slightly overrepresented in our sample yet some sample characteristics are comparable to population attributes reported in the 2010 census see section 2 for instance the average number of household members is almost identical 3 19 vs 3 24 the average income of sampled households is also similar to the average monthly household income reported in the 2010 census adjusted by annual inflation which would be equivalent to r 3545 us 1037 as of 2016 table 4 presents marginal effects from two logit models estimated to identify factors underlying the decision to support the proposed water project those marginal effects can be interpreted as changes in the probability of voting in favor of the proposed project resulting from marginal changes in corresponding covariates model 1 is a more parsimonious model where treatment and respondents socio demographic characteristics are included model 2 is an extended specification that assumes that the perceived credibility of the water quality assessment and the perceived consequentiality of this study may also affect the individual s decision to vote in favor of the project the pseudo r 2 statistics and the akaike information criterion aic indicate that model 2 performs better than model 1 3 3 several pseudo r 2 statistics have been developed for logit models table 4 presents two of the most commonly used ones mcfadden s and the count pseudo r 2 in contrast the bayesian information criterion bic favors model 1 over model 2 it is worth noting that estimation results are robust across the model specifications and that those models yield similar wtp estimates as expected estimated coefficients on fee are negative and statistically significant at 10 level this result indicates that the likelihood of voting in favor of the proposed project decreases with additional fees to be charged for improved water quality of the pds river this finding is consistent with economic theory and yields support to the construct validity of our referendum cv scenario to value water quality improvements the split sample treatment indicator restore is statistically insignificant suggesting that respondents are indifferent between 10 and 15 years to achieve a type ii classification for the pds river prior studies have found that respondents are somewhat impatient in achieving river restorations kahn et al 2017 meyer 2013 in this study we did not find statistical evidence on local residents impatience to restore the pds river at least not for the window of time included in the cv scenario 10 vs 15 years results also indicate that the probability of a favorable vote decreases with respondent s age compared to younger individuals older people may believe that they will benefit from the proposed project during a shorter period of time therefore when discounting future benefits older people may find that those discounted benefits do not surpass the present value of project fees and consequently they are less likely to vote for the pds river restoration consistent with prior studies that indicate that perceived consequentiality of cv surveys have an effect on individuals willingness to pay e g carson et al 2014 herriges et al 2010 vásquez et al 2009 the estimated coefficient on consequential is positive and statistically significant at 10 level see model 2 this result suggests that respondents who believe that this study may influence policymakers to restore the pds river are more likely to vote for the proposed project than those respondents who do not believe so other covariates were found to be statistically insignificant table 5 shows the average wtp for water quality improvements with corresponding 95 confidence intervals calculated using krinsky and robb s 1986 boot strapping procedure with 5000 simulations model 1 indicates that the average individual would pay r 47 05 more in their monthly water bill for improving the water quality of the pds river up to a type ii classification model 2 yields a similar estimate of r 44 34 wtp estimates can be compared to the average monthly household income to explore the household s ability to pay a project fee the wtp estimate derived from model 1 is equivalent to 1 25 of the reported average monthly household income and the wtp estimate from model 2 is equivalent to 1 18 of that average income these estimates represent a small share of the household income which suggests that households would be able to afford paying a project fee of r 44 to r 47 as discussed above there is a persistent concern that wtp estimates derived using the cv method can be biased due to its hypothetical nature following blumenschein et al 2008 and vossler et al 2003 among others we estimated more conservative wtp estimates by recoding favorable responses to take the value of zero i e voting against the project if the respondent reported a low certainty level of one or two out of five regarding her vote response this certainty threshold is consistent with the median certainty level of three and the average level of 3 36 4 4 it is worth noting that average certainty levels remain between 3 1 and 3 6 across proposed project fees we found reported certainty levels to be disassociated from the proposed project fee χ 2 20 66 p value 0 417 based on this criterion a total of 26 positive responses were recoded as zero table 6 shows those wtp estimates the average respondent would pay between r 30 48 and r 34 32 for water quality improvements depending on the model used to estimate those values those estimates are equivalent to 0 81 and 0 91 of the average household income respectively 5 5 higher thresholds of certainty were investigated with a certainty threshold of four 91 responses were recoded as zero when the certainty threshold was increased to five 137 responses were changed to zero the high number of responses changed due to uncertainty suggests that certainty thresholds of four and five are too demanding for the voting behavior of our respondents therefore it is not surprising that wtp estimates are statistically insignificant when favorable voting responses are recorded using those certainty thresholds 6 discussion and conclusions this study investigated the willingness to pay for restoring the paraíba do sul river one of the most important catchments in brazil the proposed environmental improvement was based on the water classification defined in the brazilian water legislation our water testing results suggest that the pds river can be currently classified as type iii the contingent valuation scenario consists of improving the river water quality up to a type ii classification with this definition of the proposed environmental improvement this study will facilitate the dialog among different stakeholders given that the brazilian legislation clearly define biological and chemical benchmarks and water services for each water classification moreover willingness to pay estimates provided in this study demonstrate the relative importance of the pds river to local residents hence this study is policy relevant and a contribution to the growing literature on contingent valuation of environmental improvements in developing countries under the current classification the pds river waters cannot be safely used for swimming skiing diving irrigation of vegetables direct contact recreation or direct human consumption with the exception of direct human consumption those services would be restored if the pds river waters were improved up to a type ii classification using the contingent valuation method this study has estimated the value that campos residents would assign to water services regained through a restoration project for the pds river conservative estimates indicate that residents are willing to pay at least r 30 in a month for improving the pds river up to a type ii classification this estimate is equivalent to 0 81 of the average household income respondents were informed that those payments would occur monthly for the next 10 years i e 120 payments using a monthly discount rate of 2 as used in rezende et al 2015 the present value of those payments would be r 1382 43 if those estimates are aggregated over the number of households in campos estimated at 144 596 connections to the potable water system the discounted total benefits would be approximately r 199 9 million this estimate can be compared to total costs of the proposed project to assess its feasibility and prioritization among other environmental and social programs this study also tested some practical hypotheses for instance we investigated effects of the perceived consequentiality of our study on willingness to pay estimates carson et al 2014 herriges et al 2010 results indicate that respondents who believe that this study could have policy consequences are willing to pay a higher amount for restoring the pds river than respondents who do not believe so in addition we tested the hypothesis that willingness to pay estimates are responsive to the perceived credibility of water quality information provided in the cv survey no evidence was found to support this hypothesis finally a split sample treatment was designed to test the hypothesis that individuals are impatient in achieving environmental improvements kahn et al 2017 findings indicate that respondents are indifferent between achieving river restoration in 10 or 15 years it could be that the average respondent has an impatience threshold outside of that window of time for instance meyer 2013 found a rapid decay in perceived benefits from river improvements over time with a loss of half of the benefits when the proposed improvements take 5 years to occur investigating local time preferences over different periods of time to achieve river restoration would be

pds river this method confirms the presence of total coliforms when the color of water samples change from colorless to yellow fecal coliform is identified using the enzymatic action of β glucuronidase which is produced by escherichia coli for fecal coliform quantification we used the quanti tray with 49 large cavities and 48 small cavities after passing through a sealer the pack was

1104,estuaries are transitional systems that link both land and oceans with particular dynamics regulated by their own characteristics the main aim of the present study was the assessment of the effects generated by a strong dry period on the distribution of inorganic nutrients and biological production within mar chiquita coastal lagoon comparing this information with that from periods of precipitation regularly conducted for this study we selected mar chiquita coastal lagoon and analyzed a 20 year data series for concentration and distribution of physical and chemical parameters in particular salinity inorganic nutrients i e dissolved inorganic nitrogen phosphate silicate and photosynthetical pigments i e chlorophyll a we also evaluated the association between these parameters and climate conditions within the region and found a strong relationship and very quick response to changes as a result we report for the first time in the region rainfall as a main driver of biogeochemical processes within the estuarine system the obtained results allowed us to confirm the clear transference processes between land and oceanic systems and the role of climate as a driver of the corresponding transference processes keywords mar chiquita coastal lagoon nutrients pigments climate control 1 introduction estuaries are among the most biologically productive and ecologically important ecosystems on earth martínez et al 2007 kasai et al 2010 barbier et al 2011 as transition zones between terrestrial and marine environments waters entering estuaries are influenced by the lands they run over i e agricultural urban and industrial bárcena et al 2012 de brye et al 2013 differences in the types of land use can have a dramatic impact on estuarine environments stoate et al 2009 rothenberger et al 2009 as well as on environmental properties and water column nutrients concentration and distribution which are particularly affected broussard and turner 2009 johnson et al 2009 struyf et al 2010 moreover the occurrence of a watershed effect i e the regulation of most of the estuarine processes by freshwater seawater flows balance has been well documented latimer and charpentier 2010 wetz et al 2011 and hence also the characterization of an estuarine condition moore and shaw 2008 falco et al 2010 the above could be framed in updated theoretical concepts on function and management of estuaries as reported in the comprehensive review by elliott and whitfield 2011 which includes a deep reinterpretation of the main paradigms on this kind of environment i e i an estuary is an ecosystem in its own right but cannot function indefinitely on its own in isolation and that it depends largely on other ecosystems possibly more so than do other ecosystems ii estuaries are more influenced by scale than any other aquatic system iii hydromorphology is the key to understanding estuarine functioning but always influenced by salinity iv although estuaries behave as sources and sinks for nutrients and organic matter in most systems allochthonous organic inputs dominate over autochthonous organic production v estuaries are physico chemically more variable than other aquatic systems vi estuaries are systems with low diversity high biomass high abundance and their ecological components show a diversity minimum in the oligohaline region vii estuaries have more human induced pressures than other systems and viii estuaries provide a wider variety of ecosystem services and an increased delivery of societal benefits than many other ecosystems elliott and whitfield 2011 in addition climate has also been reported as one of the main drivers of estuaries environmental conditions briceño and boyer 2010 gillanders et al 2011 however the effect that drought has on estuarine waters which flow from different land use is largely unknown cotrim marques et al 2007 elsdon et al 2009 consequently and keeping in mind that freshwater flowing into estuaries is coming from different origins such as runoff rainfall or groundwater de castro et al 2004 davis et al 2005 the water quality and ecology of estuaries is likely to be impaired whitehead et al 2009 mar chiquita coastal lagoon is unique within the coastal system of buenos aires province argentina and has been the subject of a number of geological climatic biological chemical and environmental studies for several decades i e lanfredi et al 1981 fasano et al 1982 marcovecchio et al 2006 hassan et al 2011 both hydrographical and physical chemical characteristics of this environment have been reported i e anger et al 1994 freije et al 1996 marcovecchio et al 1997 as well as data on seasonal variations of its hydrographical parameters marcovecchio et al 2006 the main aim of the present study was the assessment of the effects generated by a strong dry period on the distribution of inorganic nutrients and biological production within mar chiquita coastal lagoon comparing this information with that from periods of precipitation regularly conducted 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area mar chiquita coastal lagoon is located between 37 33 37 43 s and 57 15 57 30 w on the atlantic coast of buenos aires province 32km north east of mar del plata city in argentina fig 1 this environment has been opportunely declared a biosphere reserve under the unesco man biosphere program mab the lagoon has an area of 60km2 with a tributary basin close to 10 000km2 its shape is irregular and its bottom topography very smooth reaching a maximum depth of 1 50m lanfredi et al 1981 with no vertical stratification on the water column during the year the lagoon is connected to the sea through an elongated inlet channel of approximately 6km length and more than 200m width the influence of freshwater is more important than that of seawater salinity range 1 3 28 75 marcovecchio et al 2006 due to the fact that the lagoon s main input is the continental drainage which collects rainwater from a large basin including the tandilia orographic system average rainfall for this area is about 900mmyr 1 with a homogeneous distribution throughout the year even though torrential rainfall is usually recorded during the winter and spring seasons from june to october table 1 for the present study four different scenarios have been considered two periods with more intense x 959 mm yr 1 and less intense precipitation x 919 mm yr 1 as well as an extremely wet year x 1198 mm yr 1 and one unusually dry x 528 mm yr 1 moreover the role of phreatic reservoir which regulates the lagoon water level and the standard meteorological conditions of the area has been reported so that an increase in the water level within the reservoir regulates not only the depth of the lagoon but also the surface of water mirror and consequently the rainfall within the area fasano et al 1982 thus the phreatic reservoir acts as a climate regulator an increase in the area of the lagoon is coincident with a significant increase in precipitations within the region fasano et al 1982 this environment function as a transitional one which receives large amount of inorganic nutrients from neighboring terrestrial ecosystems throughout the year marcovecchio et al 2006 the combination of these particular conditions i e high nutrient availability reduced depth calm conditions within the water body restricted water circulation and homogeneity in the water column drives biological production at a higher rate than in adjacent coastal marine environment perillo et al 2006 2 2 sampling and data analysis six sampling stations were located along the coastal lagoon representing different conditions within this environment fig 1 the key characteristics of each sampling station were station 1 was located within the lagoon at the outlet to the ocean station 2 was close to the freshwater discharge of cangrejo creek where several streams drain station 3 was close to a large bridge crossing the lagoon acting as a physical barrier which traps sediments and impairs tidal penetration to the inner area station 4 was close to a large wetland area dominated by burrowing crabs station 5 was close to a major livestock farming area station 6 was in an important area for sport fishing station 7 was in the inner part of the lagoon in addition samples were also obtained within the most important streams which drain to the costal lagoon fig 1 they are de las gallinas stream grande stream vivoratá stream sotelo stream channel n 5 channel n 7 two sampling points were settled in each station one in the upstream of each stream to measure the water quality far to the lagoon and the other one in the outlet of the stream into the lagoon to measure the integrated load within the corresponding watershed in this sampling net within mar chiquita costal lagoon and its watershed we measured the spatial and seasonal variation of eight hydrographical parameters temperature conductivity salinity nitrate nitrite phosphate and silicate in water and chlorophyll a and phaeopigments in suspended particulate matter in all cases measurements were carried out at subsurface level as well as corresponding water sampling considering the shallow depth of the lagoon throughout the year and the fact that stratification was never recorded within this system sampling was developed along 21 years 1994 to 2005 with seasonal frequency in situ water temperature and conductivity salinity were measured using a horiba u 10 multisensor device previously calibrated against traditional standardized methods apha awws wef 1999 water samples were obtained using pre washed polycarbonate van dorn sampling bottles in order to determine nutrient and pigment concentrations sub samples for nutrient determination were filtered and stored in plastic bottles at 20 c while those for pigments were vacuum filtered through whatmann gf c glass fiber filters and were stored in a freezer 20 c until laboratory analysis inorganic nutrients were determined following methodologies reported by treguer and le corre 1975 for nitrate by grasshoff et al 1983 for nitrite by eberlein and kattner 1987 for phosphate and by technicon 1973 for silicate in all cases determinations were performed using a technicon aa ii four channel auto analyzer concentrations of chlorophyll a and phaeopigments in suspended particulate matter were measured according to lorenzen and jeffrey 1980 and corresponding analyses were performed by means of a shimadzu 210 a uv vis spectrophotometer calibration curves and blanks were built up using analytical grade reagents analytical quality aq control was carried out analyzing highly pure specific solutions i e nitrate nitrite etc as well as calibrating the instruments for field measurements using validated methods statistical analyses were done using analysis of variance anova test mean values assessment tukey s test correlation analysis and single linear regression analysis sokal and rohlf 1981 all statistical tests were performed using the statistica software package version 7 1 significance was set at p value 0 05 3 results during the last twenty years comprehensive studies on environmental conditions of mar chiquita coastal lagoon and its corresponding watershed have been carried out including the measurement of temperature salinity conductivity ph dissolved oxygen turbidity inorganic nutrient concentrations i e nitrate nitrite ammonium phosphate and or silicate in water and chlorophyll a phaeopigments and particulate organic matter in suspended particulate matter spm within this aquatic system freije et al 1996 de marco et al 2005 marcovecchio et al 2006 most of the processes related to biogeochemical dynamics within this system are natural ones i e organic matter mineralization physical mixing weather influence and only a few ones are anthropic agriculture and livestock activities since there are no large human settlements within the area 3 1 fluctuation of salinity levels within the coastal lagoon during the study period salinity was a very sensitive water parameter within mar chiquita coastal lagoon system which significantly responded to environmental changes i e climatic hydrodynamic during the first and longer studied period 1994 2007 a clear salinity gradient was recorded with values ranging from 29 15 in the outermost sampling station close to the sea to 2 8 in the innermost one fig 2a we identified three different areas i an external area where salinity ranged from 29 15 to 27 75 which functioned as a coastal marine system representing 12 of the coastal lagoon surface ii an intermediate area with salinity varying from 19 6 to 10 85 functioning like an estuarine system representing 23 of the coastal lagoon surface and iii an internal area where salinity varied from 9 15 to 2 8 and had the characteristics of an inland water system representing 65 of the coastal lagoon surface fig 2a worth noting average rainfall recorded for this area is close to 900mmyr 1 table 1 2009 was an extremely dry year with an average rainfall close to 530mmyr 1 table 1 this climatic condition caused a completely different salinity distribution pattern within the coastal lagoon in the same three identified areas described before the distribution trend was significantly different the first one the marine area presented a salinity range from 31 15 to 27 6 but in this case represented 71 of the coastal lagoon surface the salinity in the second area estuarine varied between 19 95 and 12 35 and represented 25 5 of the coastal lagoon surface and finally in the third area inland water system salinity varied from 7 3 to 4 1 representing 3 5 of the coastal lagoon surface fig 2b during the next analyzed period 2010 2015 the relative percentages of coastal lagoon surface as represented by each of the abovementioned areas were approximately 12 7 11 5 and 75 8 respectively fig 2c with corresponding salinity ranges of 30 7 27 3 17 15 10 3 and 5 2 1 9 respectively 3 2 inorganic nutrients concentration and distribution we analyzed the concentration and distribution patterns of inorganic nutrients i e dissolved inorganic nitrogen as the addition of nitrate nitrite and ammonium din no3 no2 nh4 soluble reactive phosphorous po4 3 and total dissolved silicate sio x within the three aforementioned areas at mar chiquita coastal lagoon during the considered periods this allowed us to characterize each of them as well as their relationship with corresponding environmental conditions for din levels and distribution during the first studied period 1994 2007 each area showed i din concentrations of 2 3 1 1μm in the marine area with a variation range of 0 2 3 65μm ii din levels in the estuarine area varied between 1 2 and 18 15μm with average values 11 6 3 7μm and iii within the inland area din values were between 14 6 and 53 1μm with mean values of 39 9 7 5μm fig 3a din mean values between 1994 and 2007 were significantly different p 0 05 among the three described areas within the coastal lagoon in the second analyzed period 2009 the same distribution pattern was identified higher din levels in the inland waters medium in the estuarine area and lower in the marine one but with quite different concentrations 92 185μm 19 62μm and 2 1 11 2μm respectively fig 3b in this case the recorded din concentrations were also significantly different p 0 05 among the three areas finally in the third period 2010 2015 we observed a different distribution trend i both the inland and the estuarine areas presented a similar din distribution with values varying from 19 to 59μm with slightly higher but not statistically significant din levels in the inland area p 0 05 ii the coastal marine showed din levels from 0 15 to 4 25μm fig 3c the comparative analysis of these results has showed significant differences p 0 05 among din values of the inland and estuarine areas with respect to those from the marine one in the case of phosphate the values distribution was highly scattered along the studied salinity gradient within the coastal lagoon regardless of the area which was considered fig 4a c on the other hand po4 3 concentration varied between 0 15 and 2 65μm with similar levels found between the three considered periods and even though concentrations from 2009 seemed to be slightly lower than those from the other two lapses fig 4 no significant differences p 0 05 were found finally dsi levels presented different distribution trends within each of the studied periods in the first period 1994 2007 we found that i the highest dsi concentrations were recorded in the inland area with values varying from 200 to 325μm ii both the estuarine and the coastal marine areas showed similar levels of dsi which ranged between 95 and 215μm and with a similar distribution trend fig 5a no significant differences p 0 05 were found between dsi levels between the considered areas in mar chiquita the distribution pattern of dsi during 2009 was different with the highest values in the inland waters 140 270μm and lowest ones in both the estuarine and the marine areas 45 150μm with highly significant differences p 0 05 between the first and the other two fig 5b finally during the third analyzed period 2010 2015 a similar and fully scattered distribution trend of dsi concentrations was found for the three studied areas within mar chiquita coastal lagoon with values ranging from 145 to 315μm fig 5c in this last period no significant differences p 0 05 were found among dsi levels of the three considered areas of the coastal lagoon 3 3 chlorophyll a distributions pattern we analyzed chlorophyll a levels in the first evaluation period 1994 2007 and found that i the highest chlorophyll a concentrations were in the inland waters ranging between 32 5 and 60 5μgl 1 and with a mean value of 50 7 85μgl 1 ii the estuarine area presented a chlorophyll a average concentration of 27 5 5 4μgl 1 with a range from 18 3 to 33 6μgl 1 and iii chlorophyll a levels in the marine area ranged between 1 1 and 17 35μgl 1 with a mean value of 7 4 4 15μgl 1 fig 6a mean values were significantly different for the three considered areas within the coastal lagoon p 0 05 the analysis that corresponds to 2009 period showed the following trend i one data set including samples of inland waters and the innermost estuarine area with chlorophyll a values ranging from 40 6 to 114 5μgl 1 and a mean value of 77 4 11 7μgl 1 ii another one including samples of the outermost estuarine area and the marine one with chlorophyll a average value of 29 4 8 75μgl 1 and a corresponding range of concentrations from 1 7 to 44 3μgl 1 fig 6b in this case chlorophyll a mean values were significantly different p 0 05 finally for the period between 2010 and 2015 we found that i the inland waters and the innermost estuarine area has showed a chlorophyll a mean concentration of 40 6 4 15μgl 1 with a range of values between 19 5 and 52 7μgl 1 and ii the outermost estuarine and the marine areas had a range between 1 1 and 21 3μgl 1 and showed an average concentration of 11 3 4 6μgl 1 fig 6c significant differences p 0 05 were observed between chlorophyll a mean values in addition chlorophyll a concentrations were significantly higher p 0 05 in samples from 2009 than those corresponding to the other two periods other physical chemical parameters were also considered as potential tracers of the variation that occurs in the mixing zone i e dissolved oxygen ph or turbidity even though their analysis has not showed clear trends it grants deeper future valuation 4 discussion dynamics and performance of the aquatic environments particularly those transitional ones connecting large catchments with the coastal marine system are fully influenced by environmental conditions among these it has been shown that weather conditions affect the ecosystems and the meteorological phenomena modify the characteristics of the environment at different scales smith and smith 2001 consequently different authors have stated that both the intensity and frequency of meteorological events could significantly modify physical and chemical scenarios within aquatic systems mainly estuaries and wetlands which in turn would result in an alteration of the associated biological assemblages e g wetz and yoskowitz 2013 liu et al 2013 in order to increase knowledge on this topic mar chiquita coastal lagoon was our case study and we analyzed two decades of data on environmental together with recorded changes in the chemical conditions of the system one of the highlights in the present study was the variations on the physical dynamics within the system represented by changes in both the salinity gradient intensity and location moreover during the period 1994 2007 an equilibrium condition was observed which included the three involved areas of this transitional system i e inland estuarine marine fig 2a it is a very well documented fact that the composition of both surface and groundwater depends on natural factors i e geological topographical meteorological hydrological and biological properties park et al 2010 wu and kuo 2012 characteristics of the drainage basin strömqvist et al 2012 and that also varies with seasonal differences in continental drainage i e runoff volumes water levels and weather conditions kayhanian et al 2012 the data presented in this study clearly show that variation in rainfall within mar chiquita catchment fully governed salinity distribution in the system and hence the ionic strength acting on the whole environment the first salinity distribution status as recorded in mar chiquita 1994 2007 seemed to be the historical one or at least the one most frequently described as typical of this estuarine system in the same way similar salinity distribution has been opportunely reported by olivier et al 1972a b spivak et al 1991 giménez 2003 and marcovecchio et al 2006 even though the geographical extension of each identified area was not particularly considered in those previous studies all of them have reported the occurrence of the three described areas i e marine estuarine and inland and the corresponding range of salinity values were also similar to those in the present study however a particular event allowed us to deeply understand the role of climatic condition in the salinity distribution within the coastal lagoon system the fact that 2009 was an extremely dry year the meteorological records of this year centro de información meteorológica servicio meteorológico nacional argentina showed rainfalls of 528mmyr 1 when the usual historic average is higher than 900mmyr 1 table 1 this particular condition determined the occurrence of a shock in the salinity distribution within the system which looked largely like a marine and estuarine highly and significantly reducing the inland area fig 2b the situation returned to a normal distribution in the following years when rainfall also reached its historical level fig 2c this significant variation in the salinity distribution pointed out the importance of climatic characteristics as a regulator of the system structure and it highlights the pressure that continental water produces over seawater when its volume is large enough in this way the continental discharge on the coastal lagoon i e continental runoff streams drainage rainfall would work like a hydraulic plug which dams seawater toward the coast inhibiting its access to the inner zone in this sense several authors have described this kind of relationship between water masses whose imbalance determine the final condition of the studied system various authors mercado and gómez 1998 gentile and gonzález 2001 pizarro et al 2007 have investigated the effect of the sudestada in argentina which is a short term hydro meteorological phenomena associated with the occurrence of winds from the southeastern quadrant which press one water mass over another the aforementioned authors have studied the effect of the sudestada on the paraná river la plata river and luján river respectively concluding in all the cases that this sustained wind produced significant changes in each studied system this phenomenon places a strong pressure on seawater against the river ones and could generate large floods resulting in significant risks for cities and human populations moreover garcía and mechoso 2005 reported that the sudestadas at la plata river strongly affect the normal river drainage modifying the physical chemical and biological characteristics of the whole system unfortunately there is little information about the effect of rainfall on the dynamics of temperate aquatic systems this kind of processes as previously described are quite usual within tropical systems where strong contrasts in seasonal rainfall often lead to episodic events manifested as large monsoonal freshwater flows i e yin 2002 but extremely scarce in temperate ones in addition it is well documented that changes in the salinity gradient causes variation in the ionic strength within the aquatic system pawlowicz et al 2010 in this sense brunk et al 1997 reported that increasing ionic strength within estuaries determines the increment of overall sorption rates with the consequent retention of substances i e pollutants organic matter within sediments and or suspended particulate matter spm similar results have been obtained by tremblay et al 2005 studying the behavior of dissolved humic substances organic matter in estuarine systems moreover jeon et al 2011 studied the influence of salinity and organic matter on the distribution coefficient kd of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa in a brackish water clay system concluding that enhancement of sorption of pfas to particulate matter at high salinity values could evoke potential risks to benthic organisms in estuarine areas this concept is quite important for our study considering that the significant change in the salinity gradient recorded in mar chiquita coastal lagoon means that the ionic strength has also widely varied along the evaluated periods and considering that different pollutants i e trace metals persistent organic pollutants have been opportunely recorded within this system de marco et al 2006 beltrame et al 2009 2010a menone et al 2000 2001 and organic matter concentrations marcovecchio et al 2006 beltrame et al 2008 the risk of variation within toxicity levels of these compounds i e increases decreases must be considered this fact was explicitly demonstrated by beltrame et al 2010b who developed a zn toxicity bioassays using the burrowing crab neohelice granulata from mar chiquita coastal lagoon as an indicator organism demonstrating that this metal was more toxic at a lower salinity i e 5psu than at a higher one i e 30psu this different structural scenario also impacts on the distribution of inorganic nutrients along the areas of the coastal lagoon as was mentioned before therefore the din levels were always maximum in the inland area and this fact is presumably related to its continental origin and washed out by runoff processes brodie et al 2012 bouwman et al 2013 din concentrations in the inland area recorded during the 1994 2007 and 2010 2015 periods were quite similar and in agreement with previous reports for the coastal lagoon i e freije et al 1996 de marco et al 2005 marcovecchio et al 2006 this area of high din levels along the whole studied periods could be considered the rofi region of freshwater influence according to statham s 2012 proposal this distribution showed the same trend but increased the levels significantly during 2009 when din levels were approximately three times higher than those previously mentioned fig 3 in this case multiple factors should be considered the origin of these nutrients within the watershed as previously mentioned and the freshwater pile up produced by the pressure of both marine and estuarine waters over the inland ones which keeps off the freshwater discharge and consequently the dilution of the din this process has been reported before din levels within considered streams of the region presented similar values than historical ones de marco et al unpublished data and considering that coastal marine waterś din contents are significantly lower piola and falabella 2009 the overload of these nutrients through this mechanism is clearly highlighted equivalent processes have been opportunely reported by hessen et al 2010 for the ob and yenisey estuaries in the norwegian arctic sea and by statham 2012 who reviewed this phenomenon within numerous estuaries all over the world moreover inorganic nitrogen nutrients could have different origins and all of them could simultaneously occur within the coastal lagoon it is important also to consider nutrients washed out from soils by runoff processes kirkby 2010 provided through rainfall adame et al 2010 released from organic matter mineralization processes weston et al 2011 transported by rivers creeks and streams seitzinger et al 2010 and included in anthropic discharges carvalho aguiar et al 2011 in this sense violaki et al 2010 strongly highlighted the role of rainfall as carrier of din to the land and or aquatic ecosystems while perakis and hedin 2002 produced a comprehensive overview on nitrogen cycling within the environment highlighting that inorganic nitrogen nutrients are extremely mobile forms and that their loss from soils even unpolluted ones can generate important long term effects on productivity and carbon storage in temperate forest ecosystems on the other hand the region of mar chiquita coastal lagoon catchment has been reported as an environment with a very high nitrogen load which in fact never reaches total depletion of this element s compounds de marco et al 2005 marcovecchio et al 2006 several authors have suggested that the streams studied may be chronically nutrient enriched systems feijoó and lombardo 2007 feijoó et al 2011 amuchástegui et al 2016 besides describing a strong relationship between dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations and land use mainly with those n based compounds also the high content of nutrients mainly those of nitrogen within soils of se buenos aires province has been opportunely reported grondona et al 2013 giletto and echeverría 2013 moreover a significant input of nutrients is incorporated into the soils through fertilization considering the whole area is mainly directed to both agriculture and cattle raising activities barral and maceira 2012 in the case of dissolved phosphate a different condition was observed the levels of po4 3 did not significantly vary between the three considered periods even though the value distribution was less scattered during the dry year 2009 than on the other two fig 4 this point should be related to the observed values which were not different along the studied salinity gradient i e freshwater estuarine water marine water and include a similar range of concentrations from the regional streams beltrame 2009 to the estuarine and marine ones de marco et al 2005 marcovecchio et al 2006 even though the same nutrient sources previously mentioned for n compounds also exist for p ones it must be highlighted that most of the phosphorous can be retained and trapped by soils fan and guo 2010 sharpley et al 2013 and only the physical chemical conditions of the system govern not only its release but also the speed of the process shen et al 2011 this is a very important point which supports the fact that the distribution of po4 3 has not varied within the present study neither when freshwater discharge pushes on the estuarine and marine environments nor in the scenario of full dominance of marine and brackish water in the coastal lagoon the analysis of dissolved silicate showed the terrestrial origin of these compounds which presented their highest concentrations in the freshwater domain a transitional zone within the estuarine area and a dilution zone in the marine one fig 5 this scheme remained the same during the so called normal periods or at least more usual periods which even showed differences in the magnitude of the transported silicate compounds however during the dry period studied this situation was modified presenting a very complex transfer from the freshwater to the estuary sea and generating the dilution zone very close to the discharge itself this modification has been attributed to the push of brackish marine waters on the continental area which hinders the usual outflow into the coastal lagoon these high dsi levels in the innest area could be explained considering both the retention of these compounds through previously reported mechanisms as well as the contribution of dsi from seawater that has considerable value in the associated coastal zone perillo et al 2006 in addition this kind of process has been clearly described in studies of submarine groundwater discharges sgd within the coastal zone i e dürr et al 2011 knee and paytan 2011 liu et al 2012 but are very scarce or even nule in studies along salinity gradients like estuarine systems i e falco et al 2010 carbonnel et al 2013 which enlights the contribution of the present study when the biological production of the coupled system i e catchment coastal lagoon coastal zone was analyzed we observed that this environment was productive and even highly productive along the whole year according to the corresponding chlorophyll a values recorded fig 6 this situation was fully in agreement with previous records as those by de marco et al 2005 marcovecchio et al 2006 or beltrame 2009 who have described the coastal lagoon as a continuously productive system the inner area of the system meaning the freshwater zone and the innermost region of the estuary proved to be the highest productive ones during both normal evaluated periods 1994 2007 and 2010 2015 with a clear decrease of chlorophyll a values along the estuarine area and the minimum levels within the marine coastal zone similar trends in chlorophyll a distribution have been reported by cloern and jassby 2009 who studied chlorophyll a time series from north inlet biscayne bay chesapeake bay ringkøbing fjord and tampa bay all of them in the northern hemisphere pérez ruzafa et al 2011 studied seven european coastal lagoons and also reported similar conclusions on chlorophyll a as indicator of phytoplankton production moreover cloern et al 2014 presented an extensive review on primary production on estuarine coastal ecosystems where a similar process to the one reported here was described for different coastal lagoons this kind of distribution has been described in other environments i e mongin et al 2011 and in most cases the freshwater influence area demonstrated to be more productive than the saline one neveux et al 2015 this fact can be supported by several points i freshwaters have a higher level of inorganic nutrients considering they have land origin staehr et al 2012 ii freshwater areas are usually less deep and calmer waters than marine ones bakun 2010 and iii the stability of the freshwater column is higher than the marine one faye et al 2011 these factors produce an environmental scenario which favors the biological production of freshwater influenced systems against marine ones moreover this production decreased when salinity increased and it is important to point out that recorded levels were high along the whole system in comparison with other marine coastal ones philippart et al 2010 souchu et al 2010 nevertheless during the dry period when most of the coastal lagoon was salty or at most brackish the described distribution trend of chlorophyll a levels remained similar with the maximum values near streams outlet and minimum ones close to the ocean fig 6 but with much higher concentrations 50 100 higher than in wet periods what happened in that situation nutrients usually discharged from land to the coastal lagoon were retained by the strength of the incoming tide which stacked them in the bottom of the lagoon producing the extremely high levels of din as opportunely recorded fig 3 within this new scenario with very high nutrients available relatively calm waters and low depth phytoplankton have extraordinary chances to increase producing the observed phenomenon in addition levels of chlorophyll a were also higher in the middle and external areas of the coastal lagoon during the dry period than in the wet ones and this is presumably linked to the redistribution that occurs with the entry and exit of the tide which is why this system has a semi diurnal tide regime lanfredi et al 1981 finally the system seemed to regain its normal dynamics when the incoming freshwater volume increased significantly this fact clearly showed that climate is one of the drivers of the biogeochemical processes that regulate the biological production within this complex system which demonstrated to be extremely sensitive to changes even in relatively short times we also compared the results obtained from mar chiquita coastal lagoon evaluation i e highest distribution of inorganic nutrients and chlorophyll a in the innest area high biological production along the whole year strong dependency on salinity condition to those reported by other authors in different coastal lagoons in the world souchu et al 2010 assessed 20 lagoons associated to the french mediterranean highlighting a strong correlation between inorganic nutrients and chlorophyll a as well as that both marine and freshwater environments responded in a similar way to nutrient enrichment in addition brito et al 2010 2012 studied the ría de formosa in southern portugal and concluded that nutrient concentrations especially nitrogen was clearly influenced by precipitation and highlighted the significance of runoff on these levels moreover aleksandrov 2010 studied both the kuronian and vistula lagoons in kaliningrad región in russia and focused on nitrogen levels chlorophyll a concentrations phytoplankton production and hydrodynamics characteristics within each of them these scenarios allowed to describe their corresponding eutrophication levels 5 concluding comments the chance to develop a long term study 20 years in mar chiquita coastal lagoon and its watershed was very advantageous considering the occurrence of different environmental conditions and the observed variation of associated biogeochemical processes the results we obtained allowed us to draw several significant conclusions the continental system is the main source of inorganic nutrients to the coastal zone different natural and anthropic processes contribute to the nutrients budget within this kind of environment climatic system conditions nutrients distribution within the aquatic environment and this affects the biological production of the system the response time of this environment was very short changing its condition in rainy or dry periods and returning to its previous condition quickly this small scale study is useful to point out that permanent or even long term variations within the climate system would produce severe changes in the biogeochemical cycles within the coastal zone with a very large number of possible consequences conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to ethical standards

1104,estuaries are transitional systems that link both land and oceans with particular dynamics regulated by their own characteristics the main aim of the present study was the assessment of the effects generated by a strong dry period on the distribution of inorganic nutrients and biological production within mar chiquita coastal lagoon comparing this information with that from periods of precipitation regularly conducted for this study we selected mar chiquita coastal lagoon and analyzed a 20 year data series for concentration and distribution of physical and chemical parameters in particular salinity inorganic nutrients i e dissolved inorganic nitrogen phosphate silicate and photosynthetical pigments i e chlorophyll a we also evaluated the association between these parameters and climate conditions within the region and found a strong relationship and very quick response to changes as a result we report for the first time in the region rainfall as a main driver of biogeochemical processes within the estuarine system the obtained results allowed us to confirm the clear transference processes between land and oceanic systems and the role of climate as a driver of the corresponding transference processes keywords mar chiquita coastal lagoon nutrients pigments climate control 1 introduction estuaries are among the most biologically productive and ecologically important ecosystems on earth martínez et al 2007 kasai et al 2010 barbier et al 2011 as transition zones between terrestrial and marine environments waters entering estuaries are influenced by the lands they run over i e agricultural urban and industrial bárcena et al 2012 de brye et al 2013 differences in the types of land use can have a dramatic impact on estuarine environments stoate et al 2009 rothenberger et al 2009 as well as on environmental properties and water column nutrients concentration and distribution which are particularly affected broussard and turner 2009 johnson et al 2009 struyf et al 2010 moreover the occurrence of a watershed effect i e the regulation of most of the estuarine processes by freshwater seawater flows balance has been well documented latimer and charpentier 2010 wetz et al 2011 and hence also the characterization of an estuarine condition moore and shaw 2008 falco et al 2010 the above could be framed in updated theoretical concepts on function and management of estuaries as reported in the comprehensive review by elliott and whitfield 2011 which includes a deep reinterpretation of the main paradigms on this kind of environment i e i an estuary is an ecosystem in its own right but cannot function indefinitely on its own in isolation and that it depends largely on other ecosystems possibly more so than do other ecosystems ii estuaries are more influenced by scale than any other aquatic system iii hydromorphology is the key to understanding estuarine functioning but always influenced by salinity iv although estuaries behave as sources and sinks for nutrients and organic matter in most systems allochthonous organic inputs dominate over autochthonous organic production v estuaries are physico chemically more variable than other aquatic systems vi estuaries are systems with low diversity high biomass high abundance and their ecological components show a diversity minimum in the oligohaline region vii estuaries have more human induced pressures than other systems and viii estuaries provide a wider variety of ecosystem services and an increased delivery of societal benefits than many other ecosystems elliott and whitfield 2011 in addition climate has also been reported as one of the main drivers of estuaries environmental conditions briceño and boyer 2010 gillanders et al 2011 however the effect that drought has on estuarine waters which flow from different land use is largely unknown cotrim marques et al 2007 elsdon et al 2009 consequently and keeping in mind that freshwater flowing into estuaries is coming from different origins such as runoff rainfall or groundwater de castro et al 2004 davis et al 2005 the water quality and ecology of estuaries is likely to be impaired whitehead et al 2009 mar chiquita coastal lagoon is unique within the coastal system of buenos aires province argentina and has been the subject of a number of geological climatic biological chemical and environmental studies for several decades i e lanfredi et al 1981 fasano et al 1982 marcovecchio et al 2006 hassan et al 2011 both hydrographical and physical chemical characteristics of this environment have been reported i e anger et al 1994 freije et al 1996 marcovecchio et al 1997 as well as data on seasonal variations of its hydrographical parameters marcovecchio et al 2006 the main aim of the present study was the assessment of the effects generated by a strong dry period on the distribution of inorganic nutrients and biological production within mar chiquita coastal lagoon comparing this information with that from periods of precipitation regularly conducted 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area mar chiquita coastal lagoon is located between 37 33 37 43 s and 57 15 57 30 w on the atlantic coast of buenos aires province 32km north east of mar del plata city in argentina fig 1 this environment has been opportunely declared a biosphere reserve under the unesco man biosphere program mab the lagoon has an area of 60km2 with a tributary basin close to 10 000km2 its shape is irregular and its bottom topography very smooth reaching a maximum depth of 1 50m lanfredi et al 1981 with no vertical stratification on the water column during the year the lagoon is connected to the sea through an elongated inlet channel of approximately 6km length and more than 200m width the influence of freshwater is more important than that of seawater salinity range 1 3 28 75 marcovecchio et al 2006 due to the fact that the lagoon s main input is the continental drainage which collects rainwater from a large basin including the tandilia orographic system average rainfall for this area is about 900mmyr 1 with a homogeneous distribution throughout the year even though torrential rainfall is usually recorded during the winter and spring seasons from june to october table 1 for the present study four different scenarios have been considered two periods with more intense x 959 mm yr 1 and less intense precipitation x 919 mm yr 1 as well as an extremely wet year x 1198 mm yr 1 and one unusually dry x 528 mm yr 1 moreover the role of phreatic reservoir which regulates the lagoon water level and the standard meteorological conditions of the area has been reported so that an increase in the water level within the reservoir regulates not only the depth of the lagoon but also the surface of water mirror and consequently the rainfall within the area fasano et al 1982 thus the phreatic reservoir acts as a climate regulator an increase in the area of the lagoon is coincident with a significant increase in precipitations within the region fasano et al 1982 this environment function as a transitional one which receives large amount of inorganic nutrients from neighboring terrestrial ecosystems throughout the year marcovecchio et al 2006 the combination of these particular conditions i e high nutrient availability reduced depth calm conditions within the water body restricted water circulation and homogeneity in the water column drives biological production at a higher rate than in adjacent coastal marine environment perillo et al 2006 2 2 sampling and data analysis six sampling stations were located along the coastal lagoon representing different conditions within this environment fig 1 the key characteristics of each sampling station were station 1 was located within the lagoon at the outlet to the ocean station 2 was close to the freshwater discharge of cangrejo creek where several streams drain station 3 was close to a large bridge crossing the lagoon acting as a physical barrier which traps sediments and impairs tidal penetration to the inner area station 4 was close to a large wetland area dominated by burrowing crabs station 5 was close to a major livestock farming area station 6 was in an important area for sport fishing station 7 was in the inner part of the lagoon in addition samples were also obtained within the most important streams which drain to the costal lagoon fig 1 they are de las gallinas stream grande stream vivoratá stream sotelo stream channel n 5 channel n 7 two sampling points were settled in each station one in the upstream of each stream to measure the water quality far to the lagoon and the other one in the outlet of the stream into the lagoon to measure the integrated load within the corresponding watershed in this sampling net within mar chiquita costal lagoon and its watershed we measured the spatial and seasonal variation of eight hydrographical parameters temperature conductivity salinity nitrate nitrite phosphate and silicate in water and chlorophyll a and phaeopigments in suspended particulate matter in all cases measurements were carried out at subsurface level as well as corresponding water sampling considering the shallow depth of the lagoon throughout the year and the fact that stratification was never recorded within this system sampling was developed along 21 years 1994 to 2005 with seasonal frequency in situ water temperature and conductivity salinity were measured using a horiba u 10 multisensor device previously calibrated against traditional standardized methods apha awws wef 1999 water samples were obtained using pre washed polycarbonate van dorn sampling bottles in order to determine nutrient and pigment concentrations sub samples for nutrient determination were filtered and stored in plastic bottles at 20 c while those for pigments were vacuum filtered through whatmann gf c glass fiber filters and were stored in a freezer 20 c until laboratory analysis inorganic nutrients were determined following methodologies reported by treguer and le corre 1975 for nitrate by grasshoff et al 1983 for nitrite by eberlein and kattner 1987 for phosphate and by technicon 1973 for silicate in all cases determinations were performed using a technicon aa ii four channel auto analyzer concentrations of chlorophyll a and phaeopigments in suspended particulate matter were measured according to lorenzen and jeffrey 1980 and corresponding analyses were performed by means of a shimadzu 210 a uv vis spectrophotometer calibration curves and blanks were built up using analytical grade reagents analytical quality aq control was carried out analyzing highly pure specific solutions i e nitrate nitrite etc as well as calibrating the instruments for field measurements using validated methods statistical analyses were done using analysis of variance anova test mean values assessment tukey s test correlation analysis and single linear regression analysis sokal and rohlf 1981 all statistical tests were performed using the statistica software package version 7 1 significance was set at p value 0 05 3 results during the last twenty years comprehensive studies on environmental conditions of mar chiquita coastal lagoon and its corresponding watershed have been carried out including the measurement of temperature salinity conductivity ph dissolved oxygen turbidity inorganic nutrient concentrations i e nitrate nitrite ammonium phosphate and or silicate in water and chlorophyll a phaeopigments and particulate organic matter in suspended particulate matter spm within this aquatic system freije et al 1996 de marco et al 2005 marcovecchio et al 2006 most of the processes related to biogeochemical dynamics within this system are natural ones i e organic matter mineralization physical mixing weather influence and only a few ones are anthropic agriculture and livestock activities since there are no large human settlements within the area 3 1 fluctuation of salinity levels within the coastal lagoon during the study period salinity was a very sensitive water parameter within mar chiquita coastal lagoon system which significantly responded to environmental changes i e climatic hydrodynamic during the first and longer studied period 1994 2007 a clear salinity gradient was recorded with values ranging from 29 15 in the outermost sampling station close to the sea to 2 8 in the innermost one fig 2a we identified three different areas i an external area where salinity ranged from 29 15 to 27 75 which functioned as a coastal marine system representing 12 of the coastal lagoon surface ii an intermediate area with salinity varying from 19 6 to 10 85 functioning like an estuarine system representing 23 of the coastal lagoon surface and iii an internal area where salinity varied from 9 15 to 2 8 and had the characteristics of an inland water system representing 65 of the coastal lagoon surface fig 2a worth noting average rainfall recorded for this area is close to 900mmyr 1 table 1 2009 was an extremely dry year with an average rainfall close to 530mmyr 1 table 1 this climatic condition caused a completely different salinity distribution pattern within the coastal lagoon in the same three identified areas described before the distribution trend was significantly different the first one the marine area presented a salinity range from 31 15 to 27 6 but in this case represented 71 of the coastal lagoon surface the salinity in the second area estuarine varied between 19 95 and 12 35 and represented 25 5 of the coastal lagoon surface and finally in the third area inland water system salinity varied from 7 3 to 4 1 representing 3 5 of the coastal lagoon surface fig 2b during the next analyzed period 2010 2015 the relative percentages of coastal lagoon surface as represented by each of the abovementioned areas were approximately 12 7 11 5 and 75 8 respectively fig 2c with corresponding salinity ranges of 30 7 27 3 17 15 10 3 and 5 2 1 9 respectively 3 2 inorganic nutrients concentration and distribution we analyzed the concentration and distribution patterns of inorganic nutrients i e dissolved inorganic nitrogen as the addition of nitrate nitrite and ammonium din no3 no2 nh4 soluble reactive phosphorous po4 3 and total dissolved silicate sio x within the three aforementioned areas at mar chiquita coastal lagoon during the considered periods this allowed us to characterize each of them as well as their relationship with corresponding environmental conditions for din levels and distribution during the first studied period 1994 2007 each area showed i din concentrations of 2 3 1 1μm in the marine area with a variation range of 0 2 3 65μm ii din levels in the estuarine area varied between 1 2 and 18 15μm with average values 11 6 3 7μm and iii within the inland area din values were between 14 6 and 53 1μm with mean values of 39 9 7 5μm fig 3a din mean values between 1994 and 2007 were significantly different p 0 05 among the three described areas within the coastal lagoon in the second analyzed period 2009 the same distribution pattern was identified higher din levels in the inland waters medium in the estuarine area and lower in the marine one but with quite different concentrations 92 185μm 19 62μm and 2 1 11 2μm respectively fig 3b in this case the recorded din concentrations were also significantly different p 0 05 among the three areas finally in the third period 2010 2015 we observed a different distribution trend i both the inland and the estuarine areas presented a similar din distribution with values varying from 19 to 59μm with slightly higher but not statistically significant din levels in the inland area p 0 05 ii the coastal marine showed din levels from 0 15 to 4 25μm fig 3c the comparative analysis of these results has showed significant differences p 0 05 among din values of the inland and estuarine areas with respect to those from the marine one in the case of phosphate the values distribution was highly scattered along the studied salinity gradient within the coastal lagoon regardless of the area which was considered fig 4a c on the other hand po4 3 concentration varied between 0 15 and 2 65μm with similar levels found between the three considered periods and even though concentrations from 2009 seemed to be slightly lower than those from the other two lapses fig 4 no significant differences p 0 05 were found finally dsi levels presented different distribution trends within each of the studied periods in the first period 1994 2007 we found that i the highest dsi concentrations were recorded in the inland area with values varying from 200 to 325μm ii both the estuarine and the coastal marine areas showed similar levels of dsi which ranged between 95 and 215μm and with a similar distribution trend fig 5a no significant differences p 0 05 were found between dsi levels between the considered areas in mar chiquita the distribution pattern of dsi during 2009 was different with the highest values in the inland waters 140 270μm and lowest ones in both the estuarine and the marine areas 45 150μm with highly significant differences p 0 05 between the first and the other two fig 5b finally during the third analyzed period 2010 2015 a similar and fully scattered distribution trend of dsi concentrations was found for the three studied areas within mar chiquita coastal lagoon with values ranging from 145 to 315μm fig 5c in this last period no significant differences p 0 05 were found among dsi levels of the three considered areas of the coastal lagoon 3 3 chlorophyll a distributions pattern we analyzed chlorophyll a levels in the first evaluation period 1994 2007 and found that i the highest chlorophyll a concentrations were in the inland waters ranging between 32 5 and 60 5μgl 1 and with a mean value of 50 7 85μgl 1 ii the estuarine area presented a chlorophyll a average concentration of 27 5 5 4μgl 1 with a range from 18 3 to 33 6μgl 1 and iii chlorophyll a levels in the marine area ranged between 1 1 and 17 35μgl 1 with a mean value of 7 4 4 15μgl 1 fig 6a mean values were significantly different for the three considered areas within the coastal lagoon p 0 05 the analysis that corresponds to 2009 period showed the following trend i one data set including samples of inland waters and the innermost estuarine area with chlorophyll a values ranging from 40 6 to 114 5μgl 1 and a mean value of 77 4 11 7μgl 1 ii another one including samples of the outermost estuarine area and the marine one with chlorophyll a average value of 29 4 8 75μgl 1 and a corresponding range of concentrations from 1 7 to 44 3μgl 1 fig 6b in this case chlorophyll a mean values were significantly different p 0 05 finally for the period between 2010 and 2015 we found that i the inland waters and the innermost estuarine area has showed a chlorophyll a mean concentration of 40 6 4 15μgl 1 with a range of values between 19 5 and 52 7μgl 1 and ii the outermost estuarine and the marine areas had a range between 1 1 and 21 3μgl 1 and showed an average concentration of 11 3 4 6μgl 1 fig 6c significant differences p 0 05 were observed between chlorophyll a mean values in addition chlorophyll a concentrations were significantly higher p 0 05 in samples from 2009 than those corresponding to the other two periods other physical chemical parameters were also considered as potential tracers of the variation that occurs in the mixing zone i e dissolved oxygen ph or turbidity even though their analysis has not showed clear trends it grants deeper future valuation 4 discussion dynamics and performance of the aquatic environments particularly those transitional ones connecting large catchments with the coastal marine system are fully influenced by environmental conditions among these it has been shown that weather conditions affect the ecosystems and the meteorological phenomena modify the characteristics of the environment at different scales smith and smith 2001 consequently different authors have stated that both the intensity and frequency of meteorological events could significantly modify physical and chemical scenarios within aquatic systems mainly estuaries and wetlands which in turn would result in an alteration of the associated biological assemblages e g wetz and yoskowitz 2013 liu et al 2013 in order to increase knowledge on this topic mar chiquita coastal lagoon was our case study and we analyzed two decades of data on environmental together with recorded changes in the chemical conditions of the system one of the highlights in the present study was the variations on the physical dynamics within the system represented by changes in both the salinity gradient intensity and location moreover during the period 1994 2007 an equilibrium condition was observed which included the three involved areas of this transitional system i e inland estuarine marine fig 2a it is a very well documented fact that the composition of both surface and groundwater depends on natural factors i e geological topographical meteorological hydrological and biological properties park et al 2010 wu and kuo 2012 characteristics of the drainage basin strömqvist et al 2012 and that also varies with seasonal differences in continental drainage i e runoff volumes water levels and weather conditions kayhanian et al 2012 the data presented in this study clearly show that variation in rainfall within mar chiquita catchment fully governed salinity distribution in the system and hence the ionic strength acting on the whole environment the first salinity distribution status as recorded in mar chiquita 1994 2007 seemed to be the historical one or at least the one most frequently described as typical of this estuarine system in the same way similar salinity distribution has been opportunely reported by olivier et al 1972a b spivak et al 1991 giménez 2003 and marcovecchio et al 2006 even though the geographical extension of each identified area was not particularly considered in those previous studies all of them have reported the occurrence of the three described areas i e marine estuarine and inland and the corresponding range of salinity values were also similar to those in the present study however a particular event allowed us to deeply understand the role of climatic condition in the salinity distribution within the coastal lagoon system the fact that 2009 was an extremely dry year the meteorological records of this year centro de información meteorológica servicio meteorológico nacional argentina showed rainfalls of 528mmyr 1 when the usual historic average is higher than 900mmyr 1 table 1 this particular condition determined the occurrence of a shock in the salinity distribution within the system which looked largely like a marine and estuarine highly and significantly reducing the inland area fig 2b the situation returned to a normal distribution in the following years when rainfall also reached its historical level fig 2c this significant variation in the salinity distribution pointed out the importance of climatic characteristics as a regulator of the system structure and it highlights the pressure that continental water produces over seawater when its volume is large enough in this way the continental discharge on the coastal lagoon i e continental runoff streams drainage rainfall would work like a hydraulic plug which dams seawater toward the coast inhibiting its access to the inner zone in this sense several authors have described this kind of relationship between water masses whose imbalance determine the final condition of the studied system various authors mercado and gómez 1998 gentile and gonzález 2001 pizarro et al 2007 have investigated the effect of the sudestada in argentina which is a short term hydro meteorological phenomena associated with the occurrence of winds from the southeastern quadrant which press one water mass over another the aforementioned authors have studied the effect of the sudestada on the paraná river la plata river and luján river respectively concluding in all the cases that this sustained wind produced significant changes in each studied system this phenomenon places a strong pressure on seawater against the river ones and could generate large floods resulting in significant risks for cities and human populations moreover garcía and mechoso 2005 reported that the sudestadas at la plata river strongly affect the normal river drainage modifying the physical chemical and biological characteristics of the whole system unfortunately there is little information about the effect of rainfall on the dynamics of temperate aquatic systems this kind of processes as previously described are quite usual within tropical systems where strong contrasts in seasonal rainfall often lead to episodic events manifested as large monsoonal freshwater flows i e yin 2002 but extremely scarce in temperate ones in addition it is well documented that changes in the salinity gradient causes variation in the ionic strength within the aquatic system pawlowicz et al 2010 in this sense brunk et al 1997 reported that increasing ionic strength within estuaries determines the increment of overall sorption rates with the consequent retention of substances i e pollutants organic matter within sediments and or suspended particulate matter spm similar results have been obtained by tremblay et al 2005 studying the behavior of dissolved humic substances organic matter in estuarine systems moreover jeon et al 2011 studied the influence of salinity and organic matter on the distribution coefficient kd of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa in a brackish water clay system concluding that enhancement of sorption of pfas to particulate matter at high salinity values could evoke potential risks to benthic organisms in estuarine areas this concept is quite important for our study considering that the significant change in the salinity gradient recorded in mar chiquita coastal lagoon means that the ionic strength has also widely varied along the evaluated periods and considering that different pollutants i e trace metals persistent organic pollutants have been opportunely recorded within this system de marco et al 2006 beltrame et al 2009 2010a menone et al 2000 2001 and organic matter concentrations marcovecchio et al 2006 beltrame et al 2008 the risk of variation within toxicity levels of these compounds i e increases decreases must be considered this fact was explicitly demonstrated by beltrame et al 2010b who developed a zn toxicity bioassays using the burrowing crab neohelice granulata from mar chiquita coastal lagoon as an indicator organism demonstrating that this metal was more toxic at a lower salinity i e 5psu than at a higher one i e 30psu this different structural scenario also impacts on the distribution of inorganic nutrients along the areas of the coastal lagoon as was mentioned before therefore the din levels were always maximum in the inland area and this fact is presumably related to its continental origin and washed out by runoff processes brodie et al 2012 bouwman et al 2013 din concentrations in the inland area recorded during the 1994 2007 and 2010 2015 periods were quite similar and in agreement with previous reports for the coastal lagoon i e freije et al 1996 de marco et al 2005 marcovecchio et al 2006 this area of high din levels along the whole studied periods could be considered the rofi region of freshwater influence according to statham s 2012 proposal this distribution showed the same trend but increased the levels significantly during 2009 when din levels were approximately three times higher than those previously mentioned fig 3 in this case multiple factors should be considered the origin of these nutrients within the watershed as previously mentioned and the freshwater pile up produced by the pressure of both marine and estuarine waters over the inland ones which keeps off the freshwater discharge and consequently the dilution of the din this process has been reported before din levels within considered streams of the region presented similar values than historical ones de marco et al unpublished data and considering that coastal marine waterś din contents are significantly lower piola and falabella 2009 the overload of these nutrients through this mechanism is clearly highlighted equivalent processes have been opportunely reported by hessen et al 2010 for the ob and yenisey estuaries in the norwegian arctic sea and by statham 2012 who reviewed this phenomenon within numerous estuaries all over the world moreover inorganic nitrogen nutrients could have different origins and all of them could simultaneously occur within the coastal lagoon it is important also to consider nutrients washed out from soils by runoff processes kirkby 2010 provided through rainfall adame et al 2010 released from organic matter mineralization processes weston et al 2011 transported by rivers creeks and streams seitzinger et al 2010 and included in anthropic discharges carvalho aguiar et al 2011 in this sense violaki et al 2010 strongly highlighted the role of rainfall as carrier of din to the land and or aquatic ecosystems while perakis and hedin 2002 produced a comprehensive overview on nitrogen cycling within the environment highlighting that inorganic nitrogen nutrients are extremely mobile forms and that their loss from soils even unpolluted ones can generate important long term effects on productivity and carbon storage in temperate forest ecosystems on the other hand the region of mar chiquita coastal lagoon catchment has been reported as an environment with a very high nitrogen load which in fact never reaches total depletion of this element s compounds de marco et al 2005 marcovecchio et al 2006 several authors have suggested that the streams studied may be chronically nutrient enriched systems feijoó and lombardo 2007 feijoó et al 2011 amuchástegui et al 2016 besides describing a strong relationship between dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations and land use mainly with those n based compounds also the high content of nutrients mainly those of nitrogen within soils of se buenos aires province has been opportunely reported grondona et al 2013 giletto and echeverría 2013 moreover a significant input of nutrients is incorporated into the soils through fertilization considering the whole area is mainly directed to both agriculture and cattle raising activities barral and maceira 2012 in the case of dissolved phosphate a different condition was observed the levels of po4 3 did not significantly vary between the three considered periods even though the value distribution was less scattered during the dry year 2009 than on the other two fig 4 this point should be related to the observed values which were not different along the studied salinity gradient i e freshwater estuarine water marine water and include a similar range of concentrations from the regional streams beltrame 2009 to the estuarine and marine ones de marco et al 2005 marcovecchio et al 2006 even though the same nutrient sources previously mentioned for n compounds also exist for p ones it must be highlighted that most of the phosphorous can be retained and trapped by soils fan and guo 2010 sharpley et al 2013 and only the physical chemical conditions of the system govern not only its release but also the speed of the process shen et al 2011 this is a very important point which supports the fact that the distribution of po4 3 has not varied within the present study neither when freshwater discharge pushes on the estuarine and marine environments nor in the scenario of full dominance of marine and brackish water in the coastal lagoon the analysis of dissolved silicate showed the terrestrial origin of these compounds which presented their highest concentrations in the freshwater domain a transitional zone within the estuarine area and a dilution zone in the marine one fig 5 this scheme remained the same during the so called normal periods or at least more usual periods which even showed differences in the magnitude of the transported silicate compounds however during the dry period studied this situation was modified presenting a very complex transfer from the freshwater to the estuary sea and generating the dilution zone very close to the discharge itself this modification has been attributed to the push of brackish marine waters on the continental area which hinders the usual outflow into the coastal lagoon these high dsi levels in the innest area could be explained considering both the retention of these compounds through previously reported mechanisms as well as the contribution of dsi from seawater that has considerable value in the associated coastal zone perillo et al 2006 in addition this kind of process has been clearly described in studies of submarine groundwater discharges sgd within the coastal zone i e dürr et al 2011 knee and paytan 2011 liu et al 2012 but are very scarce or even nule in studies along salinity gradients like estuarine systems i e falco et al 2010 carbonnel et al 2013 which enlights the contribution of the present study when the biological production of the coupled system i e catchment coastal lagoon coastal zone was analyzed we observed that this environment was productive and even highly productive along the whole year according to the corresponding chlorophyll a values recorded fig 6 this situation was fully in agreement with previous records as those by de marco et al 2005 marcovecchio et al 2006 or beltrame 2009 who have described the coastal lagoon as a continuously productive system the inner area of the system meaning the freshwater zone and the innermost region of the estuary proved to be the highest productive ones during both normal evaluated periods 1994 2007 and 2010 2015 with a clear decrease of chlorophyll a values along the estuarine area and the minimum levels within the marine coastal zone similar trends in chlorophyll a distribution have been reported by cloern and jassby 2009 who studied chlorophyll a time series from north inlet biscayne bay chesapeake bay ringkøbing fjord and tampa bay all of them in the northern hemisphere pérez ruzafa et al 2011 studied seven european coastal lagoons and also reported similar conclusions on chlorophyll a as indicator of phytoplankton production moreover cloern et al 2014 presented an extensive review on primary production on estuarine coastal ecosystems where a similar process to the one reported here was described for different coastal lagoons this kind of distribution has been described in other environments i e mongin et al 2011 and in most cases the freshwater influence area demonstrated to be more productive than the saline one neveux et al 2015 this fact can be supported by several points i freshwaters have a higher level of inorganic nutrients considering they have land origin staehr et al 2012 ii freshwater areas are usually less deep and calmer waters than marine ones bakun 2010 and iii the stability of the freshwater column is higher than the marine one faye et al 2011 these factors produce an environmental scenario which favors the biological production of freshwater influenced systems against marine ones moreover this production decreased when salinity increased and it is important to point out that recorded levels were high along the whole system in comparison with other marine coastal ones philippart et al 2010 souchu et al 2010 nevertheless during the dry period when most of the coastal lagoon was salty or at most brackish the described distribution trend of chlorophyll a levels remained similar with the maximum values near streams outlet and minimum ones close to the ocean fig 6 but with much higher concentrations 50 100 higher than in wet periods what happened in that situation nutrients usually discharged from land to the coastal lagoon were retained by the strength of the incoming tide which stacked them in the bottom of the lagoon producing the extremely high levels of din as opportunely recorded fig 3 within this new scenario with very high nutrients available relatively calm waters and low depth phytoplankton have extraordinary chances to increase producing the observed phenomenon in addition levels of chlorophyll a were also higher in the middle and external areas of the coastal lagoon during the dry period than in the wet ones and this is presumably linked to the redistribution that occurs with the entry and exit of the tide which is why this system has a semi diurnal tide regime lanfredi et al 1981 finally the system seemed to regain its normal dynamics when the incoming freshwater volume increased significantly this fact clearly showed that climate is one of the drivers of the biogeochemical processes that regulate the biological production within this complex system which demonstrated to be extremely sensitive to changes even in relatively short times we also compared the results obtained from mar chiquita coastal lagoon evaluation i e highest distribution of inorganic nutrients and chlorophyll a in the innest area high biological production along the whole year strong dependency on salinity condition to those reported by other authors in different coastal lagoons in the world souchu et al 2010 assessed 20 lagoons associated to the french mediterranean highlighting a strong correlation between inorganic nutrients and chlorophyll a as well as that both marine and freshwater environments responded in a similar way to nutrient enrichment in addition brito et al 2010 2012 studied the ría de formosa in southern portugal and concluded that nutrient concentrations especially nitrogen was clearly influenced by precipitation and highlighted the significance of runoff on these levels moreover aleksandrov 2010 studied both the kuronian and vistula lagoons in kaliningrad región in russia and focused on nitrogen levels chlorophyll a concentrations phytoplankton production and hydrodynamics characteristics within each of them these scenarios allowed to describe their corresponding eutrophication levels 5 concluding comments the chance to develop a long term study 20 years in mar chiquita coastal lagoon and its watershed was very advantageous considering the occurrence of different environmental conditions and the observed variation of associated biogeochemical processes the results we obtained allowed us to draw several significant conclusions the continental system is the main source of inorganic nutrients to the coastal zone different natural and anthropic processes contribute to the nutrients budget within this kind of environment climatic system conditions nutrients distribution within the aquatic environment and this affects the biological production of the system the response time of this environment was very short changing its condition in rainy or dry periods and returning to its previous condition quickly this small scale study is useful to point out that permanent or even long term variations within the climate system would produce severe changes in the biogeochemical cycles within the coastal zone with a very large number of possible consequences conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted according to ethical standards
