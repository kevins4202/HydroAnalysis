7915,study region dudu station rajasthan india study focus rainwater harvesting can be used as a method to recharge aquifers this can happen with a variety of scales and technologies one such example is shallow infiltration ponds chaukas which recharge groundwater and increase soil moisture facilitating pastureland development a hydrus 1d model was used to estimate potential groundwater recharge the model was calibrated using field data from 2019 and validated using data from 2020 the time series of normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was derived at annual scale to assess changes in the vegetation cover new hydrological insights for the region the modeling revealed that an additional 5 of the rainfall depth was being recharged into the groundwater in addition the additional soil moisture was allowing natural grass cover to develop which could be used by the local community as pastureland these twin benefits that the local communities are realizing could be scaled up beyond dudu to india and worldwide as many regions have barren land that is slightly sloping together with permeable soils which are the only conditions for the construction of chaukas these chauka systems have helped in sustainable water resources management in these water stressed regions and the additional livelihood support through developed pastures for animal husbandry graphical abstract ga1 keywords rainwater harvesting groundwater recharge semi arid regions hydrus data availability data underlying this paper can be accessed at https 10 17862 cranfield rd 13348424 1 introduction the development of life on earth and human progress depends strongly on the availability and use of water and globally the freshwater resources like groundwater contribute significantly in meeting the demands of domestic and agricultural water villholth 2006 over 55 of india s population which is the home to 15 of the global population relies on groundwater for an array of different activities such as irrigation water for cattle domestic consumption and industrial uses moriarty et al 2004 in india groundwater use saw rapid growth since the 1950 s soaring from 20 km3year 1 to 251 km3year 1in 2010 shah 2007 food and agriculture organization 2016 making it the world s greatest groundwater abstracter surpassing the usa and china combined food and agriculture organization 2016 it is estimated that india generates 9 of its gdp from groundwater abstraction mudrakartha 2007 as it is more flexible and reliable than the public water service 85 of the rural population and 60 of the irrigated agriculture have become dependent on groundwater this trend has been bolstered by decreasing capital costs and generous public energy subsidies world bank 2010 because of this ever increasing use of groundwater the central ground water board cgwb classified 16 of india s aquifers as overexploited and an additional 3 as in a critical state cgwb 2017 sheetal 2012 reported local water table level drop by up to 16 m between 1980 and 2010 while sarah et al 2014 mentioned in several states decline rates of 1 2 myear 1 since 2000 such declines impact small scale farmers relying on groundwater for irrigation singh et al 2002 zaveri et al 2016 furthermore the declining water table has led to the deterioration of groundwater quality in many locations coyte et al 2018 panda et al 2020 cite india as an example of surface greening and subsurface drying as signs of aquifer over exploitation started to accumulate in the 1960 s managed aquifer recharge mar or artificial recharge emerged to alleviate some of the pressure on the groundwater resources sakthivadivel 2007 in india where rainfall patterns are highly variable rainwater harvesting has been used for centuries applied to mar the principle is to store a fraction of the vast runoff volume generated during the monsoon increasing its residence time and allowing it to percolate into depleted aquifers it has received growing attention from governmental and civil institutions and was included in the central government policies on groundwater management in the 1990 s sakthivadivel 2007 in the latest version of its master plan for artificial recharge to ground water the cgwb 2013 highlighted the ambitions to build a total of 11 million recharge structures with a recharge capacity of 85 5 billion cubic meters per year this would account for 34 of india s total groundwater abstraction in 2010 fao 2016 many different structures can be built for rainwater harvesting in arid to semi arid environments check dams small dams typically built in mar application across ephemeral rivers are among the most common with the cgwb 2013 aiming to develop almost 300 000 of them very localized solutions also exist such as the shallow infiltration ponds chaukas in rajasthan a system developed by a local community organisation gram vikas navuyak mandal lapodiya gvnml practitioners consider that the main hydrological impact of chaukas is to increase and maintain soil moisture rather than recharging the aquifer themselves gram vikas navuyak mandal lapodiya 2007 this increase combined with seeding provides the community with grazing areas for several months a year increasing pastureland and supporting livelihoods additional benefits include erosion control an increase in biodiversity and an improved living environment gvnml 2007 however the size of locally managed aquifer recharge structures is small resulting in limited water holding capacity and hence the contribution to the groundwater recharge may not be significant sharda et al 2006 therefore they may not be reliable in drought years and may not provide additional benefits in catchments with other larger mar structures kumar et al 2008 on the other hand rainwater harvesting using these small structures can redistribute the harvested rainwater in the catchment by converting the excess runoff into recharge consequently altering the variables like evaporation soil moisture and streamflow in the total water balance glendenning and vervoort 2010 various rainwater harvesting methods have been studied to understand their hydrological impacts on the surrounding aquifers badiger et al 2002 neumann et al 2004 gontia and sikarwar 2005 sharda et al 2006 stiefel et al 2009 scanlon et al 2009 a holistic assessment of the chaukas was carried out by everard and west 2021 but their study relied on interview and remote sensing data rather than any field data thus there has not been any study on the recharge potential of the chuakas in this study the objectives are to quantify the recharge potential of these shallow infiltration ponds in barren lands and to determine their impact on vegetation cover 2 study area rajasthan is a northern state in india also known as the desert state of india has an area of 342 239 km2 which is 10 4 of india s total geographical area it is the largest state in indian by area and ranked 7th in the population of the country the majority of rajasthan terrain is barren and lacks vegetation coverage which indicates little water present the soil types in rajasthan are mostly sandy loamy saline alkaline and chalky calcareous the majority 91 of the population s drinking water is groundwater and 66 of the aquifers in rajasthan are overexploited cgwb 2012 due to water shortage various rainwater harvesting structures were installed to harness rainwater in the lapodiya catchment fig 1 shows a map of the lapodiya catchment depicting the different water harvesting structures such as farm ponds talab ponds chauka system nadis small ponds and anicut check dams in this region rural villages with pastoral characteristics have a small population that practices mainly agricultural activities such as crop cultivation and animal husbandry as their means of survival a non governmental organization ngo gram vikas navuyak mandal lapodiya gvnml implemented a chauka and nadis system to take on water quantity and quality problems chaukas are infiltration ponds developed locally to support pastoral lands in the early dry season the ponds store catchment runoff while the check dams act as a barrier to reduce the amount of river water from flowing out of the catchment during the monsoon season the excess rainwater from chauka and ponds flows into the river this seasonal river meets a larger dam downstream that provides water to many districts in rajasthan this network of ponds check dams and chauka systems harness the rainwater during the monsoon season for future use at the same time they maintain the soil moisture at a satisfactory level for pasture growth gvnml proactively network with the residents to mobilise supervise and coordinate their effort better to manage the water resources with the pond system so that their agricultural activities can be sustainable rainwater harvesting using these traditional and modern structures has been considered helpful by local people in developing the pasturelands and enhancing groundwater recharge however such claims have not been proven scientifically in this region the climate in lapodiya catchment is typical of a semi arid region with hot summers commencing in march and continuing until june the mean maximum temperatures in this region reach as high as 480 c in june while the temperatures drop in january between 7 70 c and 210 c cgwb 2015 the state receives maximum rainfall 90 of the total rainfall in the monsoon season june september which is the primary source of groundwater recharge the average yearly rainfall and annual potential evapotranspiration in the jaipur district is 575 7 mm 1971 2014 and 1477 7 mm respectively cgwb 2017 the chaukas in the lapodiya catchment is a unique rwh system developed indigenously by a local community organisation gvnml the chauka forms an enclosure about 2000 m2 built across a gently sloping area by placing earthen dykes on the sides one chauka trench can contain up to 25 30 cm of water when it is filled fig 2 shows the chauka system s conditions during the monsoon season fig 2a and post monsoon season fig 2b of 2019 they are designed to hold little runoff water that slowly infiltrates in the soil and are built in series so that when one chauka gets filled it will overflow to the adjoining chaukas the excess water from the chaukas flows to the nearby nadi or talab practitioners consider that the main hydrological impact of chaukas is to increase and maintain soil moisture rather than recharging the aquifer themselves uncontrolled grazing in the study area has left the pastures completely denuded of perennial grass cover frequently replaced by annual unpalatable grasses and ultimately reduced to almost bare soil under such circumstances aristida sp locally known as lapla is the only vegetation that predominates gvnml 2007 community lands were the source of the people s basic livelihood especially the poor therefore pasture improvement and plantation strategies were followed to rejuvenate the lost pasturelands soil moisture conservation through rainwater harvesting in the chauka system provides essential water for plant growth in the semi arid region of lapodiya the development of the chauka system in the barren land of lapodiya was done with the aim to convert this wasteland into a pastoral land the regional lithology prepared by cgwb suggest that aquifers in this region comprise hard rocks of the bhilwara super group comprising granulitic gneisses quartz mica schist phyllite and granite pegmatite intrusive cgwb 2013 the presence of fine sand silt and clays and banded gneiss found at varying depths accompanied by weathered and fractured zones banded gneiss mainly consists of light and dark bands of quartz and feldspar and also contains biotite hornblende and garnets weathered gneiss in the study area is made up of clay minerals including potassium iron magnesium aluminum silicate hydroxide as well as sand particles in these aquifers groundwater movement is controlled by the pore size continuity and interconnectivity of weathered and fractured parts as the primary porosity is very poor secondary porosity in weathered and fractured parts is important groundwater in the lapodiya region occurs both in the weathered zone and bedrock in unconfined conditions similar geological profile with the depth of the lapodiya catchment is given in table 1 3 methodology 3 1 monitoring network development and data collection the lapodiya catchment was identified for conducting detailed studies of the chauka system from 2019 to 2020 the chauka system presented in fig 3 is located around 1 5 km northeast of the lapodiya village a local observatory was established in the catchment to collect the daily data for rainfall temperature and evaporation in addition an automatic rain gauge class a evaporation pan and thermometers were installed in lapodiya village which is around 1 5 km away from the chauka system although this is not as close to the chauka system as would be ideal it was in a secure compound so it could be regularly monitored to understand the hydrogeology one 12 7 cm or 5 inch diameter borehole bh1 as shown in fig 3 was drilled in the study area using a down the hole drill dth rig and sediment samples were collected at every one meter interval further the bh1 was also monitored weekly for depth to water level d w below ground level bgl d w was also observed on a weekly interval in bh1 between june 2019 to september 2020 in addition a gypsum block sensor in conjunction with a watermark soil moisture meter was used to measure the soil moisture tension in the chauka field during the monsoon period of 2019 and 2020 the sensors were installed at 30 cm and 60 cm depth in the center of a chauka which measures the soil water potential between 0 and 200 kpa 0 and 200 centibars further trial pits of 150 cm were dug to collect the soil samples at a depth of 30 and 60 cm which were used for soil texture classification 3 2 potential groundwater recharge estimation using hydrus 1d hydrus 1d model was used to simulate the water flow and root water uptake in the chauka system šimůneket al 2005 assuming that the soil is homogeneous and isotropic it is also assumed that the liquid flow process does not get affected by the air phase and the contribution of the thermal gradient is negligible in the water flow the water flow in the system is based on the 1d richards equation 1 θ t x k h x 1 s where h is the soil water pressure head cm θ is the volumetric water content cm3cm 3 t is the time d x is the spatial coordinate cm k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function cm d 1 and s is the sink term cm3 d 1 representing plant water uptake which can estimated in terms ofpotential uptake rate and a stress factor feddes et al 1978 2 s h α h s p where s p is the potential root water uptake rate cm3 cm 3 d 1 and α h is the dimensionless water stress response function 0 α 1 which simulates the impact of soil moisture stress on the root water uptake for α h we used the functional form introduced by feddes et al 1978 3 α h h h 4 h 3 h 4 h 4 h h 3 1 h 3 h h 2 h h 1 h 2 h 1 h 2 h h 1 0 h h 4 o r h h 1 where h 1 and h 4 are the anaerobiosis and the wilting point above and below which root water uptake is null respectively h 2 and h 3 are the pressure heads between which root water uptake keeps the maximum rate chauka system is covered with natural grass during the rainfall season and hence values for these parameters were taken from hydrus 1d database šimůnek et al 2005 the soil water retention and soil hydraulic conductivity functions can be approximated using the van genuchten mualem constitutive relationships mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 as 4 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n 1 1 n h 0 θ s h 0 5 k h k s s e l 1 1 s e n n 1 1 1 n 2 where s e is effective saturation s e θ h θ r θ s θ r where θ r and θ s are the residual and saturated water content cm3 cm 3 respectively k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity cm d 1 the parameters α cm 1 n and l are empirical coefficients affecting the shape of the hydraulic functions the empirical parameter m is the van genuchten model parameter which is calculated as 1 1 n the chauka model had 201 nodes spaced at 0 005 m intervals to form a regular 1 m long grid and a surface area of 1 m2 the model was divided into two layers representing the upper 0 60 cm and the lower soil horizons 60 100 cm based on the soil sample analysis of the trial pit in the study site fig 4 hydrus does not calculate actual flow at the soil surface and assumes that the excess water difference between precipitation and infiltration is runoff the land use condition like bare soil surface is represented in the form of minimum root depth an atmospheric boundary condition with a surface layer was selected at the soil surface the surface layer condition permits water to build upon the surface which represents the chauka conditions the chauka s are like small infiltration trenches which are around 25 30 cm deep the height of the surface water layer representing the ponding in the chauka system increases due to runoff and reduces because of infiltration and evaporation in the chauka system trenches of 25 cm depth were excavated in around 10 area of the total chauka area since the soil moisture changes were monitored in the non trenched area the 25 cm depth was converted by dividing the 25 cm depth with the non trenched area of a chauka to an equivalent ponding depth of 0 65 0 005 cm over the remaining monitored area in this region the average annual rainfall for the last 34 years 1971 2014 is 575 7 mm in the year 2019 and 2020 the total rainfall was 700 and 760 mm respectively in the year 2019 the highest position of the water table was at 1 79 m below ground level however in 2020 it rose to 0 91 m below ground level but this was in mid september which is the last phase of monsoon in this region we selected free drainage boundary condition based on the historical evidence that the water table in this region remains well below 1 m during the monsoon season the hargreaves equation hargreaves and samani 1985 was applied to compute the evapotranspiration over a reference surface which uses the daily maximum minimum temperature and the extraterrestrial solar radiation information the value of global solar radiation s extinction coefficient was taken as 0 463 as suggested in the hydrus 1d manual šimůnek et al 2008 leaf area index values at various growth stages for the grass were obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa climate data record cdr for 2018 and 2019 vermote and noaa cdr program 2019 based on the observation taken in the field using a trial pit the value for the maximum root depth of grass in chauka was taken as 50 cm fig 4 3 3 soil hydraulic parameters estimation hydrus 1d requires the soil hydraulic parameters such as θ r θ s k s α n and l which can be determined using the physical properties of the soil soil texture is determined by the relative proportion of sand silt and clay soil samples both disturbed and undisturbed were collected from the catchment and chauka site to obtain the sand silt and clay fractions gee and or 2002 a sieve and particle size analyser were used to determine soil texture and the results were recorded as the percentage of sand silt and clay usda classification system was used to convert quantitative data to textural classification barman et al 2019 the soil samples collected from six locations within the catchment where the fractions of sand slit and clay varied between 29 and 57 26 59 and 4 9 respectively the obtained soil fractions for the chauka site were also found to be in the similar range table 2 the undisturbed soil samples were used to estimate the soil bulk and dry density using the oven dry method a pressure plate experiment was done to obtain the field capacity and wilting point of the soil which refers to moisture content corresponding to matrix suction value of 33 kpa and 1500 kpa respectively the obtained soil retention curve was fitted with the retc model van genuchten 1980 to obtain soil retention parameters as shown in table 3 the saturated hydraulic conductivity was estimated using rosetta model which uses a pedotransfer function that predicts hydraulic parameters using the soil texture data and other related information schaap et al 2001 considering the soil fractions of the chauka site are within the range of fractions observed in the catchment the derived parameters from the soil fractions were assumed to be representative for this small catchment 3 4 model calibration and validation soil parameter estimation based on field observations or laboratory analysis involves high uncertainty for most practical applications luo and sophocleous 2010 inverse modeling has been used to estimate the soil hydraulic parameters using the time series of measured soil water content and pressure head as objective functions for parameter optimization jacques et al 2002 simulation of chauka system using hydrus 1d with the rosetta based hydraulic parameter resulted into recharge estimates that werein poor agreement with the observed data therefore the inverse solution in hydrus 1d is accomplished using the levenberg marquardt nonlinear minimization method marquardt 1963 a standard approach for soil hydraulic parameters estimation the water flow and root water uptake processes were selected to optimize soil hydraulic parameters using an inverse solution approach the van genuchten model 1980 was selected for the soil hydraulic properties which requires calibration of some parameters such as θ r θ s k s α and n the observed soil moisture data from the chauka system between july and september 2019 was used for the calibration of model parameters to identify the parameters for calibration a sensitivity analysis was conducted it was observed that the estimated recharge is least sensitive to the parameters such as θ r θ s especially in the deeper layers 60 100 cm of the soil zone for a 10 variation in θ r and θ s the estimated recharge varies less than 1 at 60 100 cm depth however the estimated recharge was found to be more sensitive to other hydraulic parameters such as k s α and n since rosetta implements pedotransfer functions which predict water retention parameters and the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks based on soil data i e texture class texture distribution and bulk density and few water retention points as input may not represent the field conditions therefore most of the parameters were calibrated except the θ r and θ s of the lower soil layer 60 100 cm the error between observed and simulated pressure heads in the upper and lower soil layer was minimized during parameter optimization though the model uses automatic optimization for the parameters a trial and error approach was also used simultaneously to optimize the parameters systematically a trial and error approach was also used simultaneously to ensure that the program converges to the same global minimum in the objective function the efficacy of the calibration was checked using hydrus 1d model output model fit and convergence behaviour and visual inspection of model fitting to the field data pressure heads the soil moisture data of the year 2020 for the monsoon period july august was used to validate the calibrated soil hydraulic parameters during the validation process observed and simulated pressure heads were compared statistical indicators such as rmse and r2 were used to assess the agreement between observed and simulated values 3 5 vegetation changes in the ecosystems of semi arid regions surface processes productivity and sustainability depend significantly on the soil moisture conditions porporato et al 2002 mishra and singh 2010 legates et al 2011 jin et al 2011 soil moisture is an effective water source for plant growth in semi arid regions yang et al 2012 its response to the changes in land cover indicates the sustainability of vegetation restoration in the region normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was derived at annual scale for 1993 2019 to identify any changes in vegetation cover ndvi is a difference between reflectance in near infrared nir and red spectral bands normalized by their sum it varies between 1 and 1 wherein the higher values reflect vegetation and lower values indicate other classes such as bare ground and water the ndvi has been the most widely used vegetation index to monitor vegetation coverage health and phenology using remote sensing images at local and global scales cao et al 2018 patidar and keshari 2020 in this study a time series of landsat images including 418 images was used to derive the ndvi time series the time series data includes images from three different landsat sensors including 187 images of thematic mapper tm 153 images of enhanced tm plus etm and 78 images of operational land imager oli the time series analysis was performed in google earth engine gorelick et al 2017 4 results assessment of the chauka system of the lapodiya catchment is presented in this section for monsoon periods of 2019 june september and 2020 june september the calibration and validation results are presented for july september 2019 and july august 2020 respectively as the data of soil moisture variations was available for this period only 4 1 soil properties table 2 shows the soil textural fractions and the bulk density of the soil profile depths of 0 60 cm and 60 100 cm in the chauka system the physical analysis indicates that the soil profile varies in texture with depth changing from silt loam in the upper layer to sandy loam in the bottom layer the bulk density of the soil profiles is 1 78 g cm 3 and 1 89 g cm 3 for 0 60 cm and 60 100 cm depth respectively hunt and gilkes 1992 suggested that the bulk density at which the root growth could be restricted varies with soil type however bulk densities greater than 1 6 g cm 3 tend to restrict root growth mckenzie et al 2004 and indicates that soil porosity is low and soil is highly compacted it may also cause poor movement of air and water through the soil initial and optimized soil hydraulic parameters of the soil profiles are provided in table 3 the optimized k s value for 0 60 cm soil profile is higher 2 8 cm day 1 than the 60 100 cm profile 0 93 cm day 1 in line with the soil profiles bulk densities the computed ks values are aligned with kelishadi et al 2014 and kabir et al 2020 whose models found that the soil hydraulic conductivity in semi arid regions is less in pasturelands compared to the other cultivated soils which garcía gutiérrez et al 2018 attribute to high compactness due to intense animal grazing and low organic matter content various experimental studies have also established that if the sand is mixed with 50 silt content in a sand silt mixture the average saturated hydraulic conductivity will be four orders of magnitude smaller than that of the clean sand bandini and sathiskumar 2009 belkhatir et al 2013 4 2 rainfall variability and depth to water level d w this region is known for its erratic rainfall patterns rainfall intensity and its distribution plays a significant role in potential recharge estimation fig 5 shows the rainy days of different rainfall depth intervals for the monsoon periods of the year 2019 and 2020 according to the india meteorological department imd a rainy day has been defined as a day with 2 5 mm or more rainfall the recorded rainfall for the monsoon period of 2019 was 700 mm which was distributed within 32 rainy days between july and september with four rainfall events of over 70 mm in contrast total rainfall of 760 mm in the monsoon season of 2020 was distributed within 36 rainy days with three large 50 60 mm events in 2020 there were more days with rainfall between 10 and 50 mm fig 5 than in 2019 even though the total amount was lower in 2020 more days when the soil is saturated allow more infiltration to occur and reduce runoff the role of rainfall intensity and distribution was also evaluated by yadav et al under review which suggests that the annual recharge in semi arid regions can vary significantly due to the erratic rainfall behaviour despite high rainfall in 2019 or 2020 the recharge rate will be limited by the saturated hydraulic conductivity therefore the above average rainfall observed in 2019 and 2020 may not necessarily recharge aquifers in these semi arid regions due to physical limitation of aquifer parameters such as storativity and hydraulic conductivity however ponding in the chauka system results in decreased overland flow and provides more residence time for infiltration which will slow to a rate equal to the saturated hydraulic conductivity distributed rainfall events of long duration in the chauka system will lead to longer ponding times reduced overland flow and higher recharge as long as the water table does not intersect the land surface therefore in 2020 more rainfall events with low rainfall depth along with ponding over the chauka system results into more groundwater recharge however the impact of ponding on groundwater recharge will be limited if the heavy rains are occurring in the late monsoon season when the water table is at the ground surface high and overland flow will occur instead figs 6 and 7 show the daily rainfall potential evapotranspiration and corresponding change in depth to the groundwater level d w in the chauka system during the monsoon seasons of 2019 and 2020 the potential evapotranspiration varies within 2 4 5 mm day for both the monsoon season of 2019 and 2020 the measured d w throughout the monsoon season varies within 1 5 m in the 2019 monsoon season the d w decreased after the frequent rainfall events in july august and increased in late september due to pumping in the surrounding agricultural fields fig 6 the trend of dw in the 2020 monsoon season is presented in fig 7 which shows that the early rainfall events in june have no impact on the groundwater level due to low intensity rainfall high evapotranspiration and high soil moisture deficit in this period regular rainfall events with minimum dry spells in july and august provided substantial recharge and dw was reduced by 2 27 m bgl at the end of the monsoon season fig 7 4 3 model calibration and validation simulation of field conditions using hydrus 1d using the hydraulic parameters obtained from the retc and rosetta model were in poor agreement and mismatch with the field data therefore the model parameters calibration was done using the field based pressure head data in the objective function table 4 provides the goodness of fit measures for both calibration and validation stages the coefficient of determination r2 of pressure head variation in the calibration stage for both soil profiles were 0 87 and 0 81 further the root mean squared error rmse for pressure head data at the calibration stage was 35 66 and 26 74 cm for upper and lower soil profiles similarly the r2 values during the soil water content calibration stage were 0 89 and 0 87 while rmse was 0 005 and 0 004 for the upper and lower layers at the validation stage the r2 for pressure head data were 0 84 and 0 69 and rmse was 40 65 and 36 63 cm for upper and lower soil profiles respectively validation of soil water content in both the soil profiles was found acceptable as the r2 was 0 85 and 0 76 and rmse was 0 006 and 0 005 though the variability in the pressure head was higher in our case the calibration and validation performance was acceptable for most cases with the fitted parameterization hydrus 1d was then used to forecast the root zone soil moisture dynamics for pastureland during the monsoon season of 2019 and 2020 figs 8 and 9 show the variation in pressure head and soil water content for two depths 0 60 and 60 100 in the soil profile with the fitted parameters hydrus 1d at the calibration and validation stage respectively the above mentioned figures give a visual comparison of overall model performance during the calibration and validation stages the high r2values for both soil profile depths for pressure head show the agreement between the field measured and hydrus simulated results a similar trend was observed with rmse values for both the depths thus hydrus 1d performance for soil water content simulation was good for both calibration and validation stages however the modeling performance of the pressure head for the validation dataset shows moderate performance compared to the calibration dataset 4 4 water balance and groundwater recharge this chauka system is used as pastureland in the monsoon season and provides a significant opportunity for groundwater recharge the calibrated model of the chauka system was used to estimate the potential groundwater recharge during the monsoon period of the years 2019 and 2020 since the area is barren land excess runoff of the rainfall p was the only input component evaporation e runoff q r water uptake by the natural grassroots t drainage below the soil zone r e and soil water storage change dv in the root zone were considered as the output components excess water drained below the soil zone was considered as the potential groundwater recharge an approximate ponding depth of 6 5 mm was considered to estimate the potential recharge for the monsoon period of 2019 and 2020 the water balance obtained from the calibrated and validated hydrus 1d model of the chauka system 0 and 6 5 mm ponding for the monsoon period in 2019 and 2020 is presented in table 5 evapotranspiration evaporation and root water uptake for both years was 238 mm and 267 mm when 6 5 mm ponding was allowed in the chauka system evapotranspiration et increases with increasing seasonal water input which in this case includes excess runoff only the average evapotranspiration rate for the 2019 and 2020 monsoon periods was 1 95 mm day and 2 18 mm day respectively the water availability for et was higher in the monsoon period of 2020 resulting in higher et the et rate also increases with the decrease in depth to the groundwater level and therefore reduced depth to the water level in 2020 could have enhanced the average et rate fig 11 the evaporation is higher in case of ponding during 2020 however in 2019 the evaporation was equal between zero ponding and 6 5 mm ponding scenarios low evaporation during the 6 5 ponding case might result from skewed rainfall distribution which is concentrated within a few days with many dry spells also the higher runoff in the year 2019 resulted from high intensity rainfall events distributed in a short period it is evident from figs 6 and 7 that the high intensity rainfall is concentrated in a few days and there are many dry spells in the 2019 monsoon season but in 2020 rain is well distributed across july and august further such low evaporation in the year 2019 might be the hydrus atmospheric boundary condition which allows water to evaporate from the soil surface at the potential rate as long as the pressure head at the surface remains above a threshold value if the soil surface dries out such that the surface pressure head reaches the threshold value the boundary switches to a constant pressure head condition generally leading to a computed actual evaporation rate that is well below the potential rate in combination with high rainfall intensity and low evapotranspiration the bareness of the land and moderate slopes cause significant surface runoff in these areas as presented in table 5 in the monsoon period of 2019 approximately 37 of total rainfall is lost through runoff while it was 23 for the 2020 monsoon period the higher runoff in the year 2019 resulted from high intensity rainfall events distributed in a short period it is evident from figs 6 and 7 that the high intensity rainfall is concentrated in few days with many dry spells in the 2019 monsoon season however it is well distributed between the july and august months of 2020 in the monsoon season of 2019 the total potential groundwater recharge was 222 mm about 31 8 of the total rainfall of 700 mm table 5 potential groundwater recharge was also estimated for the monsoon season of 2020 which was 258 mm approximately 34 of the total rainfall of 760 mm in this period change in the soil water storage in this region can be attributed to recharge and evapotranspiration from groundwater in the monsoon period of 2019 the change in storage was negative table 5 due to a lack of rainfall and a high evapotranspiration rate in september however the change in soil water storage during the monsoon period of the year 2020 was positive as recharge is the dominating factor at this stage table 5 also presents the absolute error in the water balance for both the 2019 and 2020 monsoon periods which is less than 3 for both the years table 5 also presents the scenarios with zero ponding depth to highlight the importance of the chauka system in barren lands the depth of ponding on the chauka surface increases due to excess runoff and reduces because of infiltration and evaporation in 2019 6 5 mm of ponding increased the potential amount of recharge from 187 mm no ponding to 222 mm the impact of such an increase could also be seen in the reduction of runoff amount from 314 mm to 259 mm similarly in the 2020 monsoon period the estimated potential recharge increased from 177 mm in with no ponding case to 258 mm for 6 5 mm ponding reduction in the runoff from 240 mm to 180 mm was also observed when 6 5 mm ponding was allowed on the chauka system surface the comparative analysis of zero ponding and 6 5 mm of ponding on the chauka system indicates that the small storage rainwater harvesting structures like chauka have the potential to provide substantial groundwater recharge 4 5 water table response a borehole was installed and monitored weekly since june 2019 to monitor the water table response due to recharge from the chauka system bh1 groundwater is extracted from large diameter wells using diesel pumps operating extensively for irrigation during the winter resulting in the decline of the groundwater table as shown in fig 10 that the depth to water level was 4 85 m bgl in mid june 2019 16th june and rose up to 2 14 m bgl by the end of september 29th september the total rise in the depth to the water level in this period was 2 71 m with an average rate of 26 mm day the obtained cumulative bottom flux potential groundwater recharge from the developed model was also mapped with the depth to water level rise in bh1 fig 10 suggesting that the estimated potential recharge is acceptable the cumulative bottom flux of ponding and no ponding scenarios in fig 10 indicates that the ponding over the chauka surface provides additional groundwater recharge in the monsoon period of 2019 fig 11 shows the water table rises in bh1 during the monsoon season of the year 2020 along with the increase in cumulative bottom flux potential groundwater recharge for ponding and no ponding situations of the chauka system which follow a similar rising trend supporting the suitability of the approach adopted in this period the water table rose from 3 41 m bgl in early july 5th july to 0 91 m bgl at the end of september 20th september 2020 in this period the depth to water level rose up to 2 5 m with an average rate of 28 mm day the rate of rise in the water table in different years could be due to the variability in the amount and intensity of rainfall in the local area a further limitation is the possible impact of the river and other ponds on recharge in the area the river only flows for a short period after rains the other ponds are designed for storage and are constructed on impermeable soil types the borehole is within the chaukas so they will be having the biggest impact but it is hard to separate them groundwater occurrence in these low porosity hard rock areas is found in the weathered and fractured zones that primarily govern groundwater storage and transmission in these rocks a constant specific yield of 0 1 was used based on the studies conducted in similar lithological formations of rajasthan state comman 2005 glendenning and vervoort 2010 by taking the potential recharge value of 222 mm and a constant sy of 0 1 the water level in the 2019 monsoon period rose by up to 2 22 m re sy similarly in the monsoon period of 2020 the rise in the water table from the potential recharge of 258 44 mm was 2 58 m the specific yield based rise in the water table of 2 22 m is 18 less than the actual rise of 2 71 m in 2019 however in the monsoon period of 2020 it is 3 2 higher than the 2 5 m actual rise it is important to note here that the spatial variation in the specific yield can be very significant due to heterogeneity and anisotropy in aquifer properties that are characteristic of hard rock aquifers the specific yield of hard rock aquifer also varies with the depth due to change in fracture density and porosity with depth maréchal et al 2004 dewandel et al 2006 therefore a sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the optimum value of sy for the lapodiya sub catchment the sy values ranging from 0 01 to 0 15 were used to convert the estimated potential recharge into the water level rise in the aquifer the analysis suggests that a sy value of 0 1 produces minimum error between the estimated water level rise and observed water level rise in bh1 for the 2019 and 2020 monsoon periods 4 6 impact on vegetation the change in vegetation cover of this area can be seen in fig 12 which compares chauka and non chauka sites using the ndvi time series from 1993 to 2019 it is evident that the chauka area has better vegetation coverage health we hypothesize that the chaukas increase the soil moisture available to plants in a long term way that makes the plants resilient to withstand short term precipitation deficits high precipitation years including 1996 and 2010 12 reflect higher ndvis however the ndvi has increased every year despite significant fluctuations in precipitation despite various changes in precipitation the ndvi of the chauka area remains consistently higher than the non chauka area throughout the period from 1993 to 2019 very similar results were obtained in a recent study by everard and west 2021 between 2016 and 2019 using the modified mann kendall test hamed and rao 1998 hussain and mahmud 2019 it is demonstrated that ndvi values increase every year a significant positive trend with a p value of 0 008 on the contrary there is no correlation between nvdi values and precipitation and the trend in precipitation from 1993 to 2019 is found to be insignificant p value of 0 802 fig 13 the rise in ndvi values especially after 2009 could be attributed to the plantation in the year 1981 the area was completely barren the renovation and augmentation of water resources started in this area in the early 1980 s the people of nearby villages decided to conserve rainwater and soil moisture which led to the innovation of the chauka system unfortunately nvdi data is not available before 1993 which is a limitation of this analysis we also only have the gvnml s accounts that the chauka building has been the only activity and there have been no other land management interventions in the present conditions the chauka system serves lapodiya village s needs by providing assured pastureland in the early dry periods further investigations are suggested to understand the role of the chauka system in ecological sustainability and land cover improvements 4 7 sensitivity analysis the modeling approach used in this study has potential sources of uncertainty in parameters such as soil hydraulic parameters evapotranspiration rates crop parameters and root water uptake parameters this study has limited scope to consider the quantifying uncertainty in the crop parameters and root water uptake parameters however the uncertainly in the soil hydraulic parameters could be addressed based on the confidence intervals obtained from hydrus and rosetta models since the parameters obtained from rosetta models are just based on the soil properties the estimates are significantly broad in the range however a sensitivity analysis was performed to understand the impact of parametric uncertainty on the estimated potential recharge in this analysis the model parameters such as θ r θ s α n and k s were perturbated a fixed amount keeping all other parameters at a baseline value the parameters were varied separately for upper and lower soil layers parameter uncertainty was performed by perturbing each soil hydraulic parameter by 10 increment up to 40 from the optimized values table 3 fig 14 shows the parameter sensitivity analysis at the top 0 60 cm and bottom 60 100 cm soil depths that explains the relative importance of soil hydraulic parameters in quantifying recharge cm the sensitivity of soil hydraulic parameters is different in the top 0 60 cm and bottom 60 100 soil depths in the topsoil n is the most sensitive parameter followed by ks and θr while in the bottom soil zone ks is the most sensitive parameter to affect recharge followed by θs this shows that ks is the critical parameter that affects the recharge significantly for the two soil profiles 5 discussion the water balance in the chauka system for the monsoon season of 2019 and 2020 suggests that the chauka system s additional storage provides more water for potential groundwater recharge table 5 this is further confirmed by the comparative analysis of zero ponding and a 6 5 mm ponding scenario over the chauka surface which suggested that the additional ponded water on the chauka surface reduces runoff significantly in 2019 and 2020 monsoon seasons the average daily water table rise of bh1 in 2020 was higher 29 mm day than in 2019 as the larger number of rainy days permitted more recharge even though the total rainfall was less in 2020 fig 5 the recovery of well water level in the chauka system also reflected a similar pattern found in the cumulative potential recharge in both the 2019 and 2020 monsoon seasons figs 10 and 11 the groundwater level rise in bh1 due to the recharge was estimated using a constant specific yield data on aquifer parameters such as hydraulic conductivity and specific yield is scarce in india chinnasamy and agoramoorthy 2015 in this case a specific yield of 0 1 was used based on the studies conducted in similar lithological formations of rajasthan state comman 2005 glendenning and vervoort 2010 the difference between the observed groundwater level rise and estimated groundwater level rise based on the specific yield was 18 in 2019 and 3 2 in the 2020 monsoon periods specific yield affects the accuracy and confidence level of the recharge rate kim et al 2010 other potential sources of uncertainty include soil hydraulic parameters the daily reference evapotranspiration rate rainfall and root water uptake parameters jiménez martínez et al 2009 in the case of soil hydraulic parameters the calibration and validation results are presented with the correlation coefficients computed by hydrus 1d as part of the parameter optimization further the range of soil hydraulic parameters was obtained from the rosetta model using the soil texture and bulk density information spatial variability of the soil moisture in the catchment could also result in uncertain recharge estimations however it has been found in various studies that the spatial variability in the soil moisture was higher in dry periods as compared to the wet periods zucco et al 2014 dari et al 2019 therefore just one sensor based soil moisture monitoring may be sufficient to represent the catchment behavior in wet periods i e monsoon especially in the smaller catchments the key parameters which might have impacted the recharge estimates are ks and n while the other parameters will have little impact on results since the direct measurement of recharge flux was not available we used the observed groundwater head for calibration validation recharge is converted to groundwater head by dividing it with the specific yield recharge sp yield therefore the uncertainty in specific yield might have propagated to the estimated rise in groundwater head however when used in terms of bottom flux the recharge is free from the uncertainty in specific yield as it was not used in hydrus the average annual rainfall in the study area for the last 34 years is 575 7 mm with the average annual pan evaporation of 1744 7 mm cgwb 2017 the vegetation growth in the semi arid regions is generally restricted due to the low soil moisture availability such low soil moisture conditions are commonly observed in the semi arid regions where the low precipitation and high evaporation combination leaves insufficient soil moisture content yang et al 2012 landscape management such as micro topography reconstruction can effectively increase rainwater infiltration previati et al 2010 rejani and yadukumar 2010 the ndvi time series analysis in the lapodiya region from 1993 to 2019 indicates that the vegetation growth has increasded fig 12 however a detailed investigation of soil moisture dynamics and its relations to vegetation growth and sustainability in different seasons and the effects of landscape management on soil moisture dynamics is recommended for future research this study was performed on a small field site with soil moisture and water level recorded at a single location and hence it is limited to one dimensional analysis however the local impact of these small scale rainwater harvesting structures on the amount of recharge is clearly demonstrated in this study future studies could consider the spatial variability in the recharge potential of these systems using more detailed data at both spatial and temporal scales there have been various studies to estimate groundwater recharge in the northwest of india rangarajan and athavale 2000 used the tritium injection method in a rainfed grassland setting in 1972 1973 and 1994 1995 they reported the median recharge rates of 35 43 and 67 mm year representing 8 9 and 14 of rainfall 460 470 and 491 mm respectively scanlon et al 2010a 2010b studied the recharge potential of a rain fed irrigated cropland using the cl mass balance approach and nutrient availability method and found a similar recharge rate of 61 94 mm year 10 16 of precipitation 600 mm year for rain fed agriculture in a study area in jaipur both of these studies were in areas where no mar structures were present further such low recharge values may also result from variable rainfall intensity and uneven distribution yadav et al under review indicated that in semi arid regions a substantial amount of rainfall is required to reduce a high soil moisture deficit and increase the moisture content of the soil to its field capacity further rainfall variability in semi arid regions is also a significant factor in groundwater recharge conversely glendenning and vervoort 2010 made field observations in the arvari river catchment of rajasthan where check dams and ponds had been constructed to recharge groundwater they calculated the potential recharge in the range of 200 300 mm which is close to the results reported in this study the chauka system caused an additional 5 1 and 4 9 of the total rainfall to become groundwater recharge during the monsoon season of 2019 and 2020 respectively table 6 this is again similar to glendenning and vervoort 2010 who found that check dams and ponds contributed an additional 6 7 of recharge and also sharda et al 2006 and badiger et al 2002 who studied various mar structures and found that up to 10 of rainfall becomes potential recharge the significant contribution of these chauka systems in intercepting the runoff and allowing it to infiltrate into the ground surface provides a promising small scale solution for water scarcity in the semi arid regions the ability of chauka systems to intercept runoff and provide additional recharge is reflected in table 6 which indicates that the recharge in 2019 and 2020 increased by 19 and 46 respectively relative to the recharge when no ponding is allowed on the surface such high interception of runoff is extremely important for this region which has significant variability in the rainfall both at spatial and temporal scales this analysis also indicates that the groundwater recharge in this area is dependent on rainfall attributes intensity and distribution which determines the rate and pattern of the water balance components and hence the groundwater resources the evidence presented here suggests they effectively increase both recharge and vegetation and should be considered for implementation more widely furthermore this study suggests few geographical constraints to their application if there is slightly sloping barren land above an unconfined aquifer this approach could be tried this study also highlights the potential value in traditional rainwater harvesting systems to restore the depleted shallow groundwater aquifers it should be added to those documented elsewhere for example sharma et al 2018 traditional approaches are well adapted to local demand culture and hydro geography 6 conclusion small scale rainwater harvesting using both traditional and modern rainwater harvesting structures is being implemented in india to alleviate declining groundwater stores but there is a need for a better understanding of the impacts of many small rainwater harvesting structures and their broader role in water resources management field data was collected during this study in the monsoon periods of 2019 and 2020 there were many challenges working in a resource poor setting and the field data set is not fully comprehensive but nevertheless the study has highlighted the importance of these traditional structures in semi arid regions the chauka system transforms approximately 5 rainfall runoff to recharge in both the 2019 and 2020 monsoon seasons further the vegetation index derived from satellite data also highlights the contribution of the chauka system in altering the near soil surface moisture which helps develop pasturelands used in early dry periods although this conclusion comes with the caveat that the chaukas were constructed prior to the availability of satellite data credit authorship contribution statement basant yadav conceptualization

7915,study region dudu station rajasthan india study focus rainwater harvesting can be used as a method to recharge aquifers this can happen with a variety of scales and technologies one such example is shallow infiltration ponds chaukas which recharge groundwater and increase soil moisture facilitating pastureland development a hydrus 1d model was used to estimate potential groundwater recharge the model was calibrated using field data from 2019 and validated using data from 2020 the time series of normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was derived at annual scale to assess changes in the vegetation cover new hydrological insights for the region the modeling revealed that an additional 5 of the rainfall depth was being recharged into the groundwater in addition the additional soil moisture was allowing natural grass cover to develop which could be used by the local community as pastureland these twin benefits that the local communities are realizing could be scaled up beyond dudu to india and worldwide as many regions have barren land that is slightly sloping together with permeable soils which are the only conditions for the construction of chaukas these chauka systems have helped in sustainable water resources management in these water stressed regions and the additional livelihood support through developed pastures for animal husbandry graphical abstract ga1 keywords rainwater harvesting groundwater recharge semi arid regions hydrus data availability data underlying this paper can be accessed at https 10 17862 cranfield rd 13348424 1 introduction the development of life on earth and human progress depends strongly on the availability and use of water and globally the freshwater resources like groundwater contribute significantly in meeting the demands of domestic and agricultural water villholth 2006 over 55 of india s population which is the home to 15 of the global population relies on groundwater for an array of different activities such as irrigation water for cattle domestic consumption and industrial uses moriarty et al 2004 in india groundwater use saw rapid growth since the 1950 s soaring from 20 km3year 1 to 251 km3year 1in 2010 shah 2007 food and agriculture organization 2016 making it the world s greatest groundwater abstracter surpassing the usa and china combined food and agriculture organization 2016 it is estimated that india generates 9 of its gdp from groundwater abstraction mudrakartha 2007 as it is more flexible and reliable than the public water service 85 of the rural population and 60 of the irrigated agriculture have become dependent on groundwater this trend has been bolstered by decreasing capital costs and generous public energy subsidies world bank 2010 because of this ever increasing use of groundwater the central ground water board cgwb classified 16 of india s aquifers as overexploited and an additional 3 as in a critical state cgwb 2017 sheetal 2012 reported local water table level drop by up to 16 m between 1980 and 2010 while sarah et al 2014 mentioned in several states decline rates of 1 2 myear 1 since 2000 such declines impact small scale farmers relying on groundwater for irrigation singh et al 2002 zaveri et al 2016 furthermore the declining water table has led to the deterioration of groundwater quality in many locations coyte et al 2018 panda et al 2020 cite india as an example of surface greening and subsurface drying as signs of aquifer over exploitation started to accumulate in the 1960 s managed aquifer recharge mar or artificial recharge emerged to alleviate some of the pressure on the groundwater resources sakthivadivel 2007 in india where rainfall patterns are highly variable rainwater harvesting has been used for centuries applied to mar the principle is to store a fraction of the vast runoff volume generated during the monsoon increasing its residence time and allowing it to percolate into depleted aquifers it has received growing attention from governmental and civil institutions and was included in the central government policies on groundwater management in the 1990 s sakthivadivel 2007 in the latest version of its master plan for artificial recharge to ground water the cgwb 2013 highlighted the ambitions to build a total of 11 million recharge structures with a recharge capacity of 85 5 billion cubic meters per year this would account for 34 of india s total groundwater abstraction in 2010 fao 2016 many different structures can be built for rainwater harvesting in arid to semi arid environments check dams small dams typically built in mar application across ephemeral rivers are among the most common with the cgwb 2013 aiming to develop almost 300 000 of them very localized solutions also exist such as the shallow infiltration ponds chaukas in rajasthan a system developed by a local community organisation gram vikas navuyak mandal lapodiya gvnml practitioners consider that the main hydrological impact of chaukas is to increase and maintain soil moisture rather than recharging the aquifer themselves gram vikas navuyak mandal lapodiya 2007 this increase combined with seeding provides the community with grazing areas for several months a year increasing pastureland and supporting livelihoods additional benefits include erosion control an increase in biodiversity and an improved living environment gvnml 2007 however the size of locally managed aquifer recharge structures is small resulting in limited water holding capacity and hence the contribution to the groundwater recharge may not be significant sharda et al 2006 therefore they may not be reliable in drought years and may not provide additional benefits in catchments with other larger mar structures kumar et al 2008 on the other hand rainwater harvesting using these small structures can redistribute the harvested rainwater in the catchment by converting the excess runoff into recharge consequently altering the variables like evaporation soil moisture and streamflow in the total water balance glendenning and vervoort 2010 various rainwater harvesting methods have been studied to understand their hydrological impacts on the surrounding aquifers badiger et al 2002 neumann et al 2004 gontia and sikarwar 2005 sharda et al 2006 stiefel et al 2009 scanlon et al 2009 a holistic assessment of the chaukas was carried out by everard and west 2021 but their study relied on interview and remote sensing data rather than any field data thus there has not been any study on the recharge potential of the chuakas in this study the objectives are to quantify the recharge potential of these shallow infiltration ponds in barren lands and to determine their impact on vegetation cover 2 study area rajasthan is a northern state in india also known as the desert state of india has an area of 342 239 km2 which is 10 4 of india s total geographical area it is the largest state in indian by area and ranked 7th in the population of the country the majority of rajasthan terrain is barren and lacks vegetation coverage which indicates little water present the soil types in rajasthan are mostly sandy loamy saline alkaline and chalky calcareous the majority 91 of the population s drinking water is groundwater and 66 of the aquifers in rajasthan are overexploited cgwb 2012 due to water shortage various rainwater harvesting structures were installed to harness rainwater in the lapodiya catchment fig 1 shows a map of the lapodiya catchment depicting the different water harvesting structures such as farm ponds talab ponds chauka system nadis small ponds and anicut check dams in this region rural villages with pastoral characteristics have a small population that practices mainly agricultural activities such as crop cultivation and animal husbandry as their means of survival a non governmental organization ngo gram vikas navuyak mandal lapodiya gvnml implemented a chauka and nadis system to take on water quantity and quality problems chaukas are infiltration ponds developed locally to support pastoral lands in the early dry season the ponds store catchment runoff while the check dams act as a barrier to reduce the amount of river water from flowing out of the catchment during the monsoon season the excess rainwater from chauka and ponds flows into the river this seasonal river meets a larger dam downstream that provides water to many districts in rajasthan this network of ponds check dams and chauka systems harness the rainwater during the monsoon season for future use at the same time they maintain the soil moisture at a satisfactory level for pasture growth gvnml proactively network with the residents to mobilise supervise and coordinate their effort better to manage the water resources with the pond system so that their agricultural activities can be sustainable rainwater harvesting using these traditional and modern structures has been considered helpful by local people in developing the pasturelands and enhancing groundwater recharge however such claims have not been proven scientifically in this region the climate in lapodiya catchment is typical of a semi arid region with hot summers commencing in march and continuing until june the mean maximum temperatures in this region reach as high as 480 c in june while the temperatures drop in january between 7 70 c and 210 c cgwb 2015 the state receives maximum rainfall 90 of the total rainfall in the monsoon season june september which is the primary source of groundwater recharge the average yearly rainfall and annual potential evapotranspiration in the jaipur district is 575 7 mm 1971 2014 and 1477 7 mm respectively cgwb 2017 the chaukas in the lapodiya catchment is a unique rwh system developed indigenously by a local community organisation gvnml the chauka forms an enclosure about 2000 m2 built across a gently sloping area by placing earthen dykes on the sides one chauka trench can contain up to 25 30 cm of water when it is filled fig 2 shows the chauka system s conditions during the monsoon season fig 2a and post monsoon season fig 2b of 2019 they are designed to hold little runoff water that slowly infiltrates in the soil and are built in series so that when one chauka gets filled it will overflow to the adjoining chaukas the excess water from the chaukas flows to the nearby nadi or talab practitioners consider that the main hydrological impact of chaukas is to increase and maintain soil moisture rather than recharging the aquifer themselves uncontrolled grazing in the study area has left the pastures completely denuded of perennial grass cover frequently replaced by annual unpalatable grasses and ultimately reduced to almost bare soil under such circumstances aristida sp locally known as lapla is the only vegetation that predominates gvnml 2007 community lands were the source of the people s basic livelihood especially the poor therefore pasture improvement and plantation strategies were followed to rejuvenate the lost pasturelands soil moisture conservation through rainwater harvesting in the chauka system provides essential water for plant growth in the semi arid region of lapodiya the development of the chauka system in the barren land of lapodiya was done with the aim to convert this wasteland into a pastoral land the regional lithology prepared by cgwb suggest that aquifers in this region comprise hard rocks of the bhilwara super group comprising granulitic gneisses quartz mica schist phyllite and granite pegmatite intrusive cgwb 2013 the presence of fine sand silt and clays and banded gneiss found at varying depths accompanied by weathered and fractured zones banded gneiss mainly consists of light and dark bands of quartz and feldspar and also contains biotite hornblende and garnets weathered gneiss in the study area is made up of clay minerals including potassium iron magnesium aluminum silicate hydroxide as well as sand particles in these aquifers groundwater movement is controlled by the pore size continuity and interconnectivity of weathered and fractured parts as the primary porosity is very poor secondary porosity in weathered and fractured parts is important groundwater in the lapodiya region occurs both in the weathered zone and bedrock in unconfined conditions similar geological profile with the depth of the lapodiya catchment is given in table 1 3 methodology 3 1 monitoring network development and data collection the lapodiya catchment was identified for conducting detailed studies of the chauka system from 2019 to 2020 the chauka system presented in fig 3 is located around 1 5 km northeast of the lapodiya village a local observatory was established in the catchment to collect the daily data for rainfall temperature and evaporation in addition an automatic rain gauge class a evaporation pan and thermometers were installed in lapodiya village which is around 1 5 km away from the chauka system although this is not as close to the chauka system as would be ideal it was in a secure compound so it could be regularly monitored to understand the hydrogeology one 12 7 cm or 5 inch diameter borehole bh1 as shown in fig 3 was drilled in the study area using a down the hole drill dth rig and sediment samples were collected at every one meter interval further the bh1 was also monitored weekly for depth to water level d w below ground level bgl d w was also observed on a weekly interval in bh1 between june 2019 to september 2020 in addition a gypsum block sensor in conjunction with a watermark soil moisture meter was used to measure the soil moisture tension in the chauka field during the monsoon period of 2019 and 2020 the sensors were installed at 30 cm and 60 cm depth in the center of a chauka which measures the soil water potential between 0 and 200 kpa 0 and 200 centibars further trial pits of 150 cm were dug to collect the soil samples at a depth of 30 and 60 cm which were used for soil texture classification 3 2 potential groundwater recharge estimation using hydrus 1d hydrus 1d model was used to simulate the water flow and root water uptake in the chauka system šimůneket al 2005 assuming that the soil is homogeneous and isotropic it is also assumed that the liquid flow process does not get affected by the air phase and the contribution of the thermal gradient is negligible in the water flow the water flow in the system is based on the 1d richards equation 1 θ t x k h x 1 s where h is the soil water pressure head cm θ is the volumetric water content cm3cm 3 t is the time d x is the spatial coordinate cm k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function cm d 1 and s is the sink term cm3 d 1 representing plant water uptake which can estimated in terms ofpotential uptake rate and a stress factor feddes et al 1978 2 s h α h s p where s p is the potential root water uptake rate cm3 cm 3 d 1 and α h is the dimensionless water stress response function 0 α 1 which simulates the impact of soil moisture stress on the root water uptake for α h we used the functional form introduced by feddes et al 1978 3 α h h h 4 h 3 h 4 h 4 h h 3 1 h 3 h h 2 h h 1 h 2 h 1 h 2 h h 1 0 h h 4 o r h h 1 where h 1 and h 4 are the anaerobiosis and the wilting point above and below which root water uptake is null respectively h 2 and h 3 are the pressure heads between which root water uptake keeps the maximum rate chauka system is covered with natural grass during the rainfall season and hence values for these parameters were taken from hydrus 1d database šimůnek et al 2005 the soil water retention and soil hydraulic conductivity functions can be approximated using the van genuchten mualem constitutive relationships mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 as 4 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 α h n 1 1 n h 0 θ s h 0 5 k h k s s e l 1 1 s e n n 1 1 1 n 2 where s e is effective saturation s e θ h θ r θ s θ r where θ r and θ s are the residual and saturated water content cm3 cm 3 respectively k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity cm d 1 the parameters α cm 1 n and l are empirical coefficients affecting the shape of the hydraulic functions the empirical parameter m is the van genuchten model parameter which is calculated as 1 1 n the chauka model had 201 nodes spaced at 0 005 m intervals to form a regular 1 m long grid and a surface area of 1 m2 the model was divided into two layers representing the upper 0 60 cm and the lower soil horizons 60 100 cm based on the soil sample analysis of the trial pit in the study site fig 4 hydrus does not calculate actual flow at the soil surface and assumes that the excess water difference between precipitation and infiltration is runoff the land use condition like bare soil surface is represented in the form of minimum root depth an atmospheric boundary condition with a surface layer was selected at the soil surface the surface layer condition permits water to build upon the surface which represents the chauka conditions the chauka s are like small infiltration trenches which are around 25 30 cm deep the height of the surface water layer representing the ponding in the chauka system increases due to runoff and reduces because of infiltration and evaporation in the chauka system trenches of 25 cm depth were excavated in around 10 area of the total chauka area since the soil moisture changes were monitored in the non trenched area the 25 cm depth was converted by dividing the 25 cm depth with the non trenched area of a chauka to an equivalent ponding depth of 0 65 0 005 cm over the remaining monitored area in this region the average annual rainfall for the last 34 years 1971 2014 is 575 7 mm in the year 2019 and 2020 the total rainfall was 700 and 760 mm respectively in the year 2019 the highest position of the water table was at 1 79 m below ground level however in 2020 it rose to 0 91 m below ground level but this was in mid september which is the last phase of monsoon in this region we selected free drainage boundary condition based on the historical evidence that the water table in this region remains well below 1 m during the monsoon season the hargreaves equation hargreaves and samani 1985 was applied to compute the evapotranspiration over a reference surface which uses the daily maximum minimum temperature and the extraterrestrial solar radiation information the value of global solar radiation s extinction coefficient was taken as 0 463 as suggested in the hydrus 1d manual šimůnek et al 2008 leaf area index values at various growth stages for the grass were obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa climate data record cdr for 2018 and 2019 vermote and noaa cdr program 2019 based on the observation taken in the field using a trial pit the value for the maximum root depth of grass in chauka was taken as 50 cm fig 4 3 3 soil hydraulic parameters estimation hydrus 1d requires the soil hydraulic parameters such as θ r θ s k s α n and l which can be determined using the physical properties of the soil soil texture is determined by the relative proportion of sand silt and clay soil samples both disturbed and undisturbed were collected from the catchment and chauka site to obtain the sand silt and clay fractions gee and or 2002 a sieve and particle size analyser were used to determine soil texture and the results were recorded as the percentage of sand silt and clay usda classification system was used to convert quantitative data to textural classification barman et al 2019 the soil samples collected from six locations within the catchment where the fractions of sand slit and clay varied between 29 and 57 26 59 and 4 9 respectively the obtained soil fractions for the chauka site were also found to be in the similar range table 2 the undisturbed soil samples were used to estimate the soil bulk and dry density using the oven dry method a pressure plate experiment was done to obtain the field capacity and wilting point of the soil which refers to moisture content corresponding to matrix suction value of 33 kpa and 1500 kpa respectively the obtained soil retention curve was fitted with the retc model van genuchten 1980 to obtain soil retention parameters as shown in table 3 the saturated hydraulic conductivity was estimated using rosetta model which uses a pedotransfer function that predicts hydraulic parameters using the soil texture data and other related information schaap et al 2001 considering the soil fractions of the chauka site are within the range of fractions observed in the catchment the derived parameters from the soil fractions were assumed to be representative for this small catchment 3 4 model calibration and validation soil parameter estimation based on field observations or laboratory analysis involves high uncertainty for most practical applications luo and sophocleous 2010 inverse modeling has been used to estimate the soil hydraulic parameters using the time series of measured soil water content and pressure head as objective functions for parameter optimization jacques et al 2002 simulation of chauka system using hydrus 1d with the rosetta based hydraulic parameter resulted into recharge estimates that werein poor agreement with the observed data therefore the inverse solution in hydrus 1d is accomplished using the levenberg marquardt nonlinear minimization method marquardt 1963 a standard approach for soil hydraulic parameters estimation the water flow and root water uptake processes were selected to optimize soil hydraulic parameters using an inverse solution approach the van genuchten model 1980 was selected for the soil hydraulic properties which requires calibration of some parameters such as θ r θ s k s α and n the observed soil moisture data from the chauka system between july and september 2019 was used for the calibration of model parameters to identify the parameters for calibration a sensitivity analysis was conducted it was observed that the estimated recharge is least sensitive to the parameters such as θ r θ s especially in the deeper layers 60 100 cm of the soil zone for a 10 variation in θ r and θ s the estimated recharge varies less than 1 at 60 100 cm depth however the estimated recharge was found to be more sensitive to other hydraulic parameters such as k s α and n since rosetta implements pedotransfer functions which predict water retention parameters and the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks based on soil data i e texture class texture distribution and bulk density and few water retention points as input may not represent the field conditions therefore most of the parameters were calibrated except the θ r and θ s of the lower soil layer 60 100 cm the error between observed and simulated pressure heads in the upper and lower soil layer was minimized during parameter optimization though the model uses automatic optimization for the parameters a trial and error approach was also used simultaneously to optimize the parameters systematically a trial and error approach was also used simultaneously to ensure that the program converges to the same global minimum in the objective function the efficacy of the calibration was checked using hydrus 1d model output model fit and convergence behaviour and visual inspection of model fitting to the field data pressure heads the soil moisture data of the year 2020 for the monsoon period july august was used to validate the calibrated soil hydraulic parameters during the validation process observed and simulated pressure heads were compared statistical indicators such as rmse and r2 were used to assess the agreement between observed and simulated values 3 5 vegetation changes in the ecosystems of semi arid regions surface processes productivity and sustainability depend significantly on the soil moisture conditions porporato et al 2002 mishra and singh 2010 legates et al 2011 jin et al 2011 soil moisture is an effective water source for plant growth in semi arid regions yang et al 2012 its response to the changes in land cover indicates the sustainability of vegetation restoration in the region normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was derived at annual scale for 1993 2019 to identify any changes in vegetation cover ndvi is a difference between reflectance in near infrared nir and red spectral bands normalized by their sum it varies between 1 and 1 wherein the higher values reflect vegetation and lower values indicate other classes such as bare ground and water the ndvi has been the most widely used vegetation index to monitor vegetation coverage health and phenology using remote sensing images at local and global scales cao et al 2018 patidar and keshari 2020 in this study a time series of landsat images including 418 images was used to derive the ndvi time series the time series data includes images from three different landsat sensors including 187 images of thematic mapper tm 153 images of enhanced tm plus etm and 78 images of operational land imager oli the time series analysis was performed in google earth engine gorelick et al 2017 4 results assessment of the chauka system of the lapodiya catchment is presented in this section for monsoon periods of 2019 june september and 2020 june september the calibration and validation results are presented for july september 2019 and july august 2020 respectively as the data of soil moisture variations was available for this period only 4 1 soil properties table 2 shows the soil textural fractions and the bulk density of the soil profile depths of 0 60 cm and 60 100 cm in the chauka system the physical analysis indicates that the soil profile varies in texture with depth changing from silt loam in the upper layer to sandy loam in the bottom layer the bulk density of the soil profiles is 1 78 g cm 3 and 1 89 g cm 3 for 0 60 cm and 60 100 cm depth respectively hunt and gilkes 1992 suggested that the bulk density at which the root growth could be restricted varies with soil type however bulk densities greater than 1 6 g cm 3 tend to restrict root growth mckenzie et al 2004 and indicates that soil porosity is low and soil is highly compacted it may also cause poor movement of air and water through the soil initial and optimized soil hydraulic parameters of the soil profiles are provided in table 3 the optimized k s value for 0 60 cm soil profile is higher 2 8 cm day 1 than the 60 100 cm profile 0 93 cm day 1 in line with the soil profiles bulk densities the computed ks values are aligned with kelishadi et al 2014 and kabir et al 2020 whose models found that the soil hydraulic conductivity in semi arid regions is less in pasturelands compared to the other cultivated soils which garcía gutiérrez et al 2018 attribute to high compactness due to intense animal grazing and low organic matter content various experimental studies have also established that if the sand is mixed with 50 silt content in a sand silt mixture the average saturated hydraulic conductivity will be four orders of magnitude smaller than that of the clean sand bandini and sathiskumar 2009 belkhatir et al 2013 4 2 rainfall variability and depth to water level d w this region is known for its erratic rainfall patterns rainfall intensity and its distribution plays a significant role in potential recharge estimation fig 5 shows the rainy days of different rainfall depth intervals for the monsoon periods of the year 2019 and 2020 according to the india meteorological department imd a rainy day has been defined as a day with 2 5 mm or more rainfall the recorded rainfall for the monsoon period of 2019 was 700 mm which was distributed within 32 rainy days between july and september with four rainfall events of over 70 mm in contrast total rainfall of 760 mm in the monsoon season of 2020 was distributed within 36 rainy days with three large 50 60 mm events in 2020 there were more days with rainfall between 10 and 50 mm fig 5 than in 2019 even though the total amount was lower in 2020 more days when the soil is saturated allow more infiltration to occur and reduce runoff the role of rainfall intensity and distribution was also evaluated by yadav et al under review which suggests that the annual recharge in semi arid regions can vary significantly due to the erratic rainfall behaviour despite high rainfall in 2019 or 2020 the recharge rate will be limited by the saturated hydraulic conductivity therefore the above average rainfall observed in 2019 and 2020 may not necessarily recharge aquifers in these semi arid regions due to physical limitation of aquifer parameters such as storativity and hydraulic conductivity however ponding in the chauka system results in decreased overland flow and provides more residence time for infiltration which will slow to a rate equal to the saturated hydraulic conductivity distributed rainfall events of long duration in the chauka system will lead to longer ponding times reduced overland flow and higher recharge as long as the water table does not intersect the land surface therefore in 2020 more rainfall events with low rainfall depth along with ponding over the chauka system results into more groundwater recharge however the impact of ponding on groundwater recharge will be limited if the heavy rains are occurring in the late monsoon season when the water table is at the ground surface high and overland flow will occur instead figs 6 and 7 show the daily rainfall potential evapotranspiration and corresponding change in depth to the groundwater level d w in the chauka system during the monsoon seasons of 2019 and 2020 the potential evapotranspiration varies within 2 4 5 mm day for both the monsoon season of 2019 and 2020 the measured d w throughout the monsoon season varies within 1 5 m in the 2019 monsoon season the d w decreased after the frequent rainfall events in july august and increased in late september due to pumping in the surrounding agricultural fields fig 6 the trend of dw in the 2020 monsoon season is presented in fig 7 which shows that the early rainfall events in june have no impact on the groundwater level due to low intensity rainfall high evapotranspiration and high soil moisture deficit in this period regular rainfall events with minimum dry spells in july and august provided substantial recharge and dw was reduced by 2 27 m bgl at the end of the monsoon season fig 7 4 3 model calibration and validation simulation of field conditions using hydrus 1d using the hydraulic parameters obtained from the retc and rosetta model were in poor agreement and mismatch with the field data therefore the model parameters calibration was done using the field based pressure head data in the objective function table 4 provides the goodness of fit measures for both calibration and validation stages the coefficient of determination r2 of pressure head variation in the calibration stage for both soil profiles were 0 87 and 0 81 further the root mean squared error rmse for pressure head data at the calibration stage was 35 66 and 26 74 cm for upper and lower soil profiles similarly the r2 values during the soil water content calibration stage were 0 89 and 0 87 while rmse was 0 005 and 0 004 for the upper and lower layers at the validation stage the r2 for pressure head data were 0 84 and 0 69 and rmse was 40 65 and 36 63 cm for upper and lower soil profiles respectively validation of soil water content in both the soil profiles was found acceptable as the r2 was 0 85 and 0 76 and rmse was 0 006 and 0 005 though the variability in the pressure head was higher in our case the calibration and validation performance was acceptable for most cases with the fitted parameterization hydrus 1d was then used to forecast the root zone soil moisture dynamics for pastureland during the monsoon season of 2019 and 2020 figs 8 and 9 show the variation in pressure head and soil water content for two depths 0 60 and 60 100 in the soil profile with the fitted parameters hydrus 1d at the calibration and validation stage respectively the above mentioned figures give a visual comparison of overall model performance during the calibration and validation stages the high r2values for both soil profile depths for pressure head show the agreement between the field measured and hydrus simulated results a similar trend was observed with rmse values for both the depths thus hydrus 1d performance for soil water content simulation was good for both calibration and validation stages however the modeling performance of the pressure head for the validation dataset shows moderate performance compared to the calibration dataset 4 4 water balance and groundwater recharge this chauka system is used as pastureland in the monsoon season and provides a significant opportunity for groundwater recharge the calibrated model of the chauka system was used to estimate the potential groundwater recharge during the monsoon period of the years 2019 and 2020 since the area is barren land excess runoff of the rainfall p was the only input component evaporation e runoff q r water uptake by the natural grassroots t drainage below the soil zone r e and soil water storage change dv in the root zone were considered as the output components excess water drained below the soil zone was considered as the potential groundwater recharge an approximate ponding depth of 6 5 mm was considered to estimate the potential recharge for the monsoon period of 2019 and 2020 the water balance obtained from the calibrated and validated hydrus 1d model of the chauka system 0 and 6 5 mm ponding for the monsoon period in 2019 and 2020 is presented in table 5 evapotranspiration evaporation and root water uptake for both years was 238 mm and 267 mm when 6 5 mm ponding was allowed in the chauka system evapotranspiration et increases with increasing seasonal water input which in this case includes excess runoff only the average evapotranspiration rate for the 2019 and 2020 monsoon periods was 1 95 mm day and 2 18 mm day respectively the water availability for et was higher in the monsoon period of 2020 resulting in higher et the et rate also increases with the decrease in depth to the groundwater level and therefore reduced depth to the water level in 2020 could have enhanced the average et rate fig 11 the evaporation is higher in case of ponding during 2020 however in 2019 the evaporation was equal between zero ponding and 6 5 mm ponding scenarios low evaporation during the 6 5 ponding case might result from skewed rainfall distribution which is concentrated within a few days with many dry spells also the higher runoff in the year 2019 resulted from high intensity rainfall events distributed in a short period it is evident from figs 6 and 7 that the high intensity rainfall is concentrated in a few days and there are many dry spells in the 2019 monsoon season but in 2020 rain is well distributed across july and august further such low evaporation in the year 2019 might be the hydrus atmospheric boundary condition which allows water to evaporate from the soil surface at the potential rate as long as the pressure head at the surface remains above a threshold value if the soil surface dries out such that the surface pressure head reaches the threshold value the boundary switches to a constant pressure head condition generally leading to a computed actual evaporation rate that is well below the potential rate in combination with high rainfall intensity and low evapotranspiration the bareness of the land and moderate slopes cause significant surface runoff in these areas as presented in table 5 in the monsoon period of 2019 approximately 37 of total rainfall is lost through runoff while it was 23 for the 2020 monsoon period the higher runoff in the year 2019 resulted from high intensity rainfall events distributed in a short period it is evident from figs 6 and 7 that the high intensity rainfall is concentrated in few days with many dry spells in the 2019 monsoon season however it is well distributed between the july and august months of 2020 in the monsoon season of 2019 the total potential groundwater recharge was 222 mm about 31 8 of the total rainfall of 700 mm table 5 potential groundwater recharge was also estimated for the monsoon season of 2020 which was 258 mm approximately 34 of the total rainfall of 760 mm in this period change in the soil water storage in this region can be attributed to recharge and evapotranspiration from groundwater in the monsoon period of 2019 the change in storage was negative table 5 due to a lack of rainfall and a high evapotranspiration rate in september however the change in soil water storage during the monsoon period of the year 2020 was positive as recharge is the dominating factor at this stage table 5 also presents the absolute error in the water balance for both the 2019 and 2020 monsoon periods which is less than 3 for both the years table 5 also presents the scenarios with zero ponding depth to highlight the importance of the chauka system in barren lands the depth of ponding on the chauka surface increases due to excess runoff and reduces because of infiltration and evaporation in 2019 6 5 mm of ponding increased the potential amount of recharge from 187 mm no ponding to 222 mm the impact of such an increase could also be seen in the reduction of runoff amount from 314 mm to 259 mm similarly in the 2020 monsoon period the estimated potential recharge increased from 177 mm in with no ponding case to 258 mm for 6 5 mm ponding reduction in the runoff from 240 mm to 180 mm was also observed when 6 5 mm ponding was allowed on the chauka system surface the comparative analysis of zero ponding and 6 5 mm of ponding on the chauka system indicates that the small storage rainwater harvesting structures like chauka have the potential to provide substantial groundwater recharge 4 5 water table response a borehole was installed and monitored weekly since june 2019 to monitor the water table response due to recharge from the chauka system bh1 groundwater is extracted from large diameter wells using diesel pumps operating extensively for irrigation during the winter resulting in the decline of the groundwater table as shown in fig 10 that the depth to water level was 4 85 m bgl in mid june 2019 16th june and rose up to 2 14 m bgl by the end of september 29th september the total rise in the depth to the water level in this period was 2 71 m with an average rate of 26 mm day the obtained cumulative bottom flux potential groundwater recharge from the developed model was also mapped with the depth to water level rise in bh1 fig 10 suggesting that the estimated potential recharge is acceptable the cumulative bottom flux of ponding and no ponding scenarios in fig 10 indicates that the ponding over the chauka surface provides additional groundwater recharge in the monsoon period of 2019 fig 11 shows the water table rises in bh1 during the monsoon season of the year 2020 along with the increase in cumulative bottom flux potential groundwater recharge for ponding and no ponding situations of the chauka system which follow a similar rising trend supporting the suitability of the approach adopted in this period the water table rose from 3 41 m bgl in early july 5th july to 0 91 m bgl at the end of september 20th september 2020 in this period the depth to water level rose up to 2 5 m with an average rate of 28 mm day the rate of rise in the water table in different years could be due to the variability in the amount and intensity of rainfall in the local area a further limitation is the possible impact of the river and other ponds on recharge in the area the river only flows for a short period after rains the other ponds are designed for storage and are constructed on impermeable soil types the borehole is within the chaukas so they will be having the biggest impact but it is hard to separate them groundwater occurrence in these low porosity hard rock areas is found in the weathered and fractured zones that primarily govern groundwater storage and transmission in these rocks a constant specific yield of 0 1 was used based on the studies conducted in similar lithological formations of rajasthan state comman 2005 glendenning and vervoort 2010 by taking the potential recharge value of 222 mm and a constant sy of 0 1 the water level in the 2019 monsoon period rose by up to 2 22 m re sy similarly in the monsoon period of 2020 the rise in the water table from the potential recharge of 258 44 mm was 2 58 m the specific yield based rise in the water table of 2 22 m is 18 less than the actual rise of 2 71 m in 2019 however in the monsoon period of 2020 it is 3 2 higher than the 2 5 m actual rise it is important to note here that the spatial variation in the specific yield can be very significant due to heterogeneity and anisotropy in aquifer properties that are characteristic of hard rock aquifers the specific yield of hard rock aquifer also varies with the depth due to change in fracture density and porosity with depth maréchal et al 2004 dewandel et al 2006 therefore a sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the optimum value of sy for the lapodiya sub catchment the sy values ranging from 0 01 to 0 15 were used to convert the estimated potential recharge into the water level rise in the aquifer the analysis suggests that a sy value of 0 1 produces minimum error between the estimated water level rise and observed water level rise in bh1 for the 2019 and 2020 monsoon periods 4 6 impact on vegetation the change in vegetation cover of this area can be seen in fig 12 which compares chauka and non chauka sites using the ndvi time series from 1993 to 2019 it is evident that the chauka area has better vegetation coverage health we hypothesize that the chaukas increase the soil moisture available to plants in a long term way that makes the plants resilient to withstand short term precipitation deficits high precipitation years including 1996 and 2010 12 reflect higher ndvis however the ndvi has increased every year despite significant fluctuations in precipitation despite various changes in precipitation the ndvi of the chauka area remains consistently higher than the non chauka area throughout the period from 1993 to 2019 very similar results were obtained in a recent study by everard and west 2021 between 2016 and 2019 using the modified mann kendall test hamed and rao 1998 hussain and mahmud 2019 it is demonstrated that ndvi values increase every year a significant positive trend with a p value of 0 008 on the contrary there is no correlation between nvdi values and precipitation and the trend in precipitation from 1993 to 2019 is found to be insignificant p value of 0 802 fig 13 the rise in ndvi values especially after 2009 could be attributed to the plantation in the year 1981 the area was completely barren the renovation and augmentation of water resources started in this area in the early 1980 s the people of nearby villages decided to conserve rainwater and soil moisture which led to the innovation of the chauka system unfortunately nvdi data is not available before 1993 which is a limitation of this analysis we also only have the gvnml s accounts that the chauka building has been the only activity and there have been no other land management interventions in the present conditions the chauka system serves lapodiya village s needs by providing assured pastureland in the early dry periods further investigations are suggested to understand the role of the chauka system in ecological sustainability and land cover improvements 4 7 sensitivity analysis the modeling approach used in this study has potential sources of uncertainty in parameters such as soil hydraulic parameters evapotranspiration rates crop parameters and root water uptake parameters this study has limited scope to consider the quantifying uncertainty in the crop parameters and root water uptake parameters however the uncertainly in the soil hydraulic parameters could be addressed based on the confidence intervals obtained from hydrus and rosetta models since the parameters obtained from rosetta models are just based on the soil properties the estimates are significantly broad in the range however a sensitivity analysis was performed to understand the impact of parametric uncertainty on the estimated potential recharge in this analysis the model parameters such as θ r θ s α n and k s were perturbated a fixed amount keeping all other parameters at a baseline value the parameters were varied separately for upper and lower soil layers parameter uncertainty was performed by perturbing each soil hydraulic parameter by 10 increment up to 40 from the optimized values table 3 fig 14 shows the parameter sensitivity analysis at the top 0 60 cm and bottom 60 100 cm soil depths that explains the relative importance of soil hydraulic parameters in quantifying recharge cm the sensitivity of soil hydraulic parameters is different in the top 0 60 cm and bottom 60 100 soil depths in the topsoil n is the most sensitive parameter followed by ks and θr while in the bottom soil zone ks is the most sensitive parameter to affect recharge followed by θs this shows that ks is the critical parameter that affects the recharge significantly for the two soil profiles 5 discussion the water balance in the chauka system for the monsoon season of 2019 and 2020 suggests that the chauka system s additional storage provides more water for potential groundwater recharge table 5 this is further confirmed by the comparative analysis of zero ponding and a 6 5 mm ponding scenario over the chauka surface which suggested that the additional ponded water on the chauka surface reduces runoff significantly in 2019 and 2020 monsoon seasons the average daily water table rise of bh1 in 2020 was higher 29 mm day than in 2019 as the larger number of rainy days permitted more recharge even though the total rainfall was less in 2020 fig 5 the recovery of well water level in the chauka system also reflected a similar pattern found in the cumulative potential recharge in both the 2019 and 2020 monsoon seasons figs 10 and 11 the groundwater level rise in bh1 due to the recharge was estimated using a constant specific yield data on aquifer parameters such as hydraulic conductivity and specific yield is scarce in india chinnasamy and agoramoorthy 2015 in this case a specific yield of 0 1 was used based on the studies conducted in similar lithological formations of rajasthan state comman 2005 glendenning and vervoort 2010 the difference between the observed groundwater level rise and estimated groundwater level rise based on the specific yield was 18 in 2019 and 3 2 in the 2020 monsoon periods specific yield affects the accuracy and confidence level of the recharge rate kim et al 2010 other potential sources of uncertainty include soil hydraulic parameters the daily reference evapotranspiration rate rainfall and root water uptake parameters jiménez martínez et al 2009 in the case of soil hydraulic parameters the calibration and validation results are presented with the correlation coefficients computed by hydrus 1d as part of the parameter optimization further the range of soil hydraulic parameters was obtained from the rosetta model using the soil texture and bulk density information spatial variability of the soil moisture in the catchment could also result in uncertain recharge estimations however it has been found in various studies that the spatial variability in the soil moisture was higher in dry periods as compared to the wet periods zucco et al 2014 dari et al 2019 therefore just one sensor based soil moisture monitoring may be sufficient to represent the catchment behavior in wet periods i e monsoon especially in the smaller catchments the key parameters which might have impacted the recharge estimates are ks and n while the other parameters will have little impact on results since the direct measurement of recharge flux was not available we used the observed groundwater head for calibration validation recharge is converted to groundwater head by dividing it with the specific yield recharge sp yield therefore the uncertainty in specific yield might have propagated to the estimated rise in groundwater head however when used in terms of bottom flux the recharge is free from the uncertainty in specific yield as it was not used in hydrus the average annual rainfall in the study area for the last 34 years is 575 7 mm with the average annual pan evaporation of 1744 7 mm cgwb 2017 the vegetation growth in the semi arid regions is generally restricted due to the low soil moisture availability such low soil moisture conditions are commonly observed in the semi arid regions where the low precipitation and high evaporation combination leaves insufficient soil moisture content yang et al 2012 landscape management such as micro topography reconstruction can effectively increase rainwater infiltration previati et al 2010 rejani and yadukumar 2010 the ndvi time series analysis in the lapodiya region from 1993 to 2019 indicates that the vegetation growth has increasded fig 12 however a detailed investigation of soil moisture dynamics and its relations to vegetation growth and sustainability in different seasons and the effects of landscape management on soil moisture dynamics is recommended for future research this study was performed on a small field site with soil moisture and water level recorded at a single location and hence it is limited to one dimensional analysis however the local impact of these small scale rainwater harvesting structures on the amount of recharge is clearly demonstrated in this study future studies could consider the spatial variability in the recharge potential of these systems using more detailed data at both spatial and temporal scales there have been various studies to estimate groundwater recharge in the northwest of india rangarajan and athavale 2000 used the tritium injection method in a rainfed grassland setting in 1972 1973 and 1994 1995 they reported the median recharge rates of 35 43 and 67 mm year representing 8 9 and 14 of rainfall 460 470 and 491 mm respectively scanlon et al 2010a 2010b studied the recharge potential of a rain fed irrigated cropland using the cl mass balance approach and nutrient availability method and found a similar recharge rate of 61 94 mm year 10 16 of precipitation 600 mm year for rain fed agriculture in a study area in jaipur both of these studies were in areas where no mar structures were present further such low recharge values may also result from variable rainfall intensity and uneven distribution yadav et al under review indicated that in semi arid regions a substantial amount of rainfall is required to reduce a high soil moisture deficit and increase the moisture content of the soil to its field capacity further rainfall variability in semi arid regions is also a significant factor in groundwater recharge conversely glendenning and vervoort 2010 made field observations in the arvari river catchment of rajasthan where check dams and ponds had been constructed to recharge groundwater they calculated the potential recharge in the range of 200 300 mm which is close to the results reported in this study the chauka system caused an additional 5 1 and 4 9 of the total rainfall to become groundwater recharge during the monsoon season of 2019 and 2020 respectively table 6 this is again similar to glendenning and vervoort 2010 who found that check dams and ponds contributed an additional 6 7 of recharge and also sharda et al 2006 and badiger et al 2002 who studied various mar structures and found that up to 10 of rainfall becomes potential recharge the significant contribution of these chauka systems in intercepting the runoff and allowing it to infiltrate into the ground surface provides a promising small scale solution for water scarcity in the semi arid regions the ability of chauka systems to intercept runoff and provide additional recharge is reflected in table 6 which indicates that the recharge in 2019 and 2020 increased by 19 and 46 respectively relative to the recharge when no ponding is allowed on the surface such high interception of runoff is extremely important for this region which has significant variability in the rainfall both at spatial and temporal scales this analysis also indicates that the groundwater recharge in this area is dependent on rainfall attributes intensity and distribution which determines the rate and pattern of the water balance components and hence the groundwater resources the evidence presented here suggests they effectively increase both recharge and vegetation and should be considered for implementation more widely furthermore this study suggests few geographical constraints to their application if there is slightly sloping barren land above an unconfined aquifer this approach could be tried this study also highlights the potential value in traditional rainwater harvesting systems to restore the depleted shallow groundwater aquifers it should be added to those documented elsewhere for example sharma et al 2018 traditional approaches are well adapted to local demand culture and hydro geography 6 conclusion small scale rainwater harvesting using both traditional and modern rainwater harvesting structures is being implemented in india to alleviate declining groundwater stores but there is a need for a better understanding of the impacts of many small rainwater harvesting structures and their broader role in water resources management field data was collected during this study in the monsoon periods of 2019 and 2020 there were many challenges working in a resource poor setting and the field data set is not fully comprehensive but nevertheless the study has highlighted the importance of these traditional structures in semi arid regions the chauka system transforms approximately 5 rainfall runoff to recharge in both the 2019 and 2020 monsoon seasons further the vegetation index derived from satellite data also highlights the contribution of the chauka system in altering the near soil surface moisture which helps develop pasturelands used in early dry periods although this conclusion comes with the caveat that the chaukas were constructed prior to the availability of satellite data credit authorship contribution statement basant yadav conceptualization

7916,study region qinghai lake qinghai tibet plateau china study focus water color has been recognized as an essential climate variable for lakes and oceans forel ule index fui as one representative water color quantization parameter is a useful indicator that shows water turbidity variations in lakes in this study the time series of fui images were constructed for qinghai lake the largest salt water lake in china from 1986 to 2020 based on landsat and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data the multi source satellite data were first evaluated and compared with regard to the derivation of fui then the spatial and temporal variations of water color in qinghai lake and its driving forces were analyzed new hydrological insights for the region the results revealed that the fui showed a significant decreasing trend in qinghai lake from 1986 to 2004 and a significant increasing trend from 2004 to 2020 which temporally coincided with the water level variations in qinghai lake the water level water temperature precipitation and runoff were strongly correlated with the changes of fui correlation coefficients of 0 65 0 78 the substantial increases in precipitation and water temperature after 2004 can be the major causes for the transitional increase of water color in qinghai lake this reflects one response mode of water quality in lakes to climate change graphical abstract ga1 keywords qinghai lake fui water color long term change climate change 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp and its surrounding areas are referred to as the third pole of the earth where a large number of lakes are widely and densely distributed sun et al 2018 due to the harsh environment on the tp lakes in the region are rarely affected by human activities and are known as the sentinels and indicators of climate change zhu et al 2019 the temperature of the tibetan plateau is increasing at a rate of 0 46 c decade in the past decades which is 1 5 fold higher than the global rate zhang et al 2013 the increase in temperature accelerates the melting of glaciers and permafrost degradation and shortens the ice cover periods of lakes together these factors also affect the water temperature of lakes kuang and jiao 2016 wan et al 2018 the precipitation over the tibetan plateau has increased over the decades which together with the glacial meltwater has resulted in more runoff as well as lakes expansion and rising water levels zhang et al 2020 as a result of the rapid climate change lakes on the tp are significantly evolving in terms of water volume water temperature and ice phenology qinghai lake is the largest lake on the tp it plays an important role in the surrounding semi arid ecosystem fan et al 2021 studies have shown that qinghai lake is experiencing rapid water environment change due to the global warming and the local wet dry hydrological transition during the last half century chang et al 2017 tang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 the water level of the lake has changed dramatically over the past 50 years in a seesaw pattern fan et al 2021 fang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 the freezing dates of qinghai lake have been delayed the ablation dates have been earlier in the past 40 years and the ice cover period has decreased by almost 21 days cai et al 2017 most of the studies have been conducted on the analyses and understanding of changes in traditional hydrological parameters but there is limited literature on the long term time series of water quality variations in qinghai lake the impact of climate change on water quality change in this lake during the last half century remains unclear along with water level and water temperature water color has been recognized by global climate observing system gcos as an essential climate variable for both lakes and oceans which can be used to track the long term variability of the aquatic system in response to climate change wang et al 2021 water color is the outcome of interactions between water constituents i e chlorophyll a chla colored dissolved organic matter cdom total suspended matter tsm and sunlight garaba et al 2015 wang et al 2015 wernand et al 2013 water color can indicate the water turbidity changes in lakes wang et al 2020 the variations of the lake s hydro meteorological factors would inevitably affect the material and energy dynamics of the lake and therefore influence its water color forel ule index fui which classifies water color into 21 classes from dark blue to yellowish brown is the most important water color quantization parameter and has been used by oceanographers and limnologists since the 19th century novoa et al 2013 the use of fui can characterize the water color and water quality changes in lakes and oceans wernand et al 2013 studies have shown that fui derived from satellite data have low uncertainty and can be theoretically transferred between different sensors van der woerd and wernand 2018 2015 wang et al 2018 fui has played an increasingly important role in recent years for large scale and long term water quality monitoring the transferability of fui between satellite sensors also provides an advantage in combining multi source satellite data for obtaining more reliable spatial and temporal variations of water quality in this study fui was derived using both moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and landsat tm oli data to track the long term water quality change in qinghai lake during the past 35 years for the first time the consistency between multi source satellite data in the derivation of time series of fui was evaluated the long term changing variations of fui in qinghai lake were identified and analyzed using the multi source data and the impact of climate change on the water color changes of qinghai lake was explored and discussed 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area located in the northeast of tp 36 32 37 15 n 99 37 100 47 e qinghai lake has an mean altitude of 3260 m covers an area of approximately 4265 km2 and is 104 km long e w 62 km wide n s zhang song et al 2019 and has an average water depth of 21 m ao et al 2014 li et al 2006 the average annual temperature of qinghai lake is between 0 9 and 1 4 and the average annual precipitation fluctuates between 260 and 572 mm qinghai lake is a closed basin lake with no outflow and is recharged mainly by direct precipitation and runoff from more than 50 intermittent rivers among which buha river is the main source the qinghai lake basin is one of the most sensitive areas to global climate change chang et al 2017 yuan et al 2012 fig 1 presents the location of the qinghai lake and the meteorological and hydrological stations near the lake meanwhile the in situ measurement stations random sampling points and subregion partition for qinghai lake are shown in the figure 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 landsat data landsat data managed by the united states geological survey usgs provide a 40 year record of space based land cover change observations irons et al 2012 including the capacity for water quality monitoring at a 30 m resolution barnes et al 2015 all landsat surface reflectance sr data l1tp covering qinghai lake are available on google earth engine gee https earthengine google com gorelick et al 2017 landsat sr data include atmospheric corrected surface reflectance and surface temperature obtained from the thematic mapper tm enhanced tm plus etm and operational land imager oli sensors respectively landsat 5 7 sr products were created using the landsat ecosystem disturbance adaptive processing system ledaps algorithm woerd and wernand 2015 landsat 8 sr products were created using the land surface reflectance code lasrc vermote et al 2016 the tm covers the period from january 1984 to may 2012 etm covers the period from may 1999 to april 2022 and oli covers the period from april 2013 to present as the etm slc failed on 31 may 2003 etm images were not used there is no image available in qinghai lake in 1984 and 1985 so only images from 1986 were collected 2 2 2 modis data modis data have daily coverage high sensitivity and cost free distribution but are limited to low spatial resolution of 500 m to 1 km and are only traceable after 2000 wu et al 2008 the modis product mod09a1 is an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance that provides bands 1 7 in the 8 day composite gridded l3 product in the sinusoidal projection including 500 m reflectance values and 1 km observation and geolocation statistics all mod09a1 data covering qinghai lake were collected from gee to derive fui images by the method of wang et al 2021 the daily product mod09ga was also used to pair with the in situ data and evaluate the consistency among landsat 5 landsat 8 and modis 2 2 3 hydro meteorological data qinghai lake hydrology and climate data 1956 2020 qlhc and the china meteorological forcing dataset 1979 2018 cmfd were downloaded from the national tibetan plateau third pole environment data center http data tpdc ac cn to analyze factors associated with fui variation qlhc includes annual water level water temperature runoff ice cover period precipitation and temperature these data were collected through gauge stations near qinghai lake gangcha xiashe and buha stations shown in fig 1 zhang 2021 cmfd was made through the fusion of remote sensing products a reanalysis dataset and in situ observational data from meteorological stations which is less accurate than the observed data kun and jie 2019 cmfd provides data for each month and the precipitation temperature and windspeed in cmfd were used for auxiliary analysis 2 2 4 in situ measurements spectral data for sampling stations fig 1 were measured by cruise surveys on 23 24 august 2014 and 15 17 july 2021 using a ger 1500 spectrometer wavelength range 350 1050 nm and asd fieldspec spectroradiometer wavelength range 350 2500 nm the above water method was used to measure water leaving reflectance rrs above the water surface mobley 1999 mueller et al 2003 tang et al 2004 after measuring the radiance of the water body l s w λ sky light l s k y λ and gray panel l p λ r rs λ were calculated as follows 1 r rs λ l w λ e d λ l sw λ r sky l sky λ π l p λ ρ p λ where λ is the wavelength l w λ is the water leaving radiance e d λ is the downlink irradiance r sky is the reflectance of sky light at the air water interface which can be derived from the lut mobley 1999 and ρ p λ is the standard panel reflectance along with the water surface spectrum collection water samples were collected in the cruise survey in 2021 the chla and tsm concentration and the absorption coefficient of cdom at 440 nm a codm 440 were determined in the lab following the methods described in relevant protocols mueller et al 2003 a summary of the timelines for the cruise surveys hydro meteorological data and landsat data are shown in fig 2 the modis data was not shown in the figure because the data is represented on a daily basis and there an insignificant difference in the number of images used among the years 3 methods 3 1 satellite data preprocessing 3 1 1 water leaving reflectance correction for modis and landsat data although the landsat and modis sr data perform well on land feng et al 2013 vuolo et al 2015 there is no accurate water leaving reflectance correction for water bodies vuolo et al 2015 a simple correction method for calculating water leaving reflectance from sr data was used in this study for both landsat and modis data to remove the residual noises in the sr data wang et al 2016 despite some limitations this method offers easy implementation and stable performance over lakes wang et al 2016 yin et al 2021 and can be calculated as follows 2 r rs λ r λ min r nir r swir π where r rs λ is water leaving reflectance r λ is the original reflectance of landsat and modis and min r nir r swir is the minimum positive reflectance value for the nir and swir bands 3 1 2 sun glint correction for landsat data sun glint is a serious interference factor for remote sensing of water properties especially for satellite data with high spatial resolution such as landsat and sentinel 2 data abascal zorrilla et al 2019 kay et al 2009 in some landsat images severe sun glint caused by specular reflection can result in unusually large brightness values in all the bands which can further bring in large uncertainties in the water color derivation overstreet and legleiter 2016 in this study a method proposed by abascal zorrilla et al 2019 to correct sun glint from landsat 8 images was used by establishing the linear relationship between swir2 and visible bands this method is based on the assumption that the amount of sun glint in the visible bands is linearly related to the brightness in the swir band by selecting pixels in the region where the sun glint is evident the following relationship is established 3 r i r i b i r swir 2 mi n swir 2 where r i is the corrected surface reflectance at band i r i is the original reflectance at band i r swir 2 is the reflectance in swir2 b i is the slope of the linear regression equation between r i and r swir 2 and mi n swir 2 is the minimum value of r swir 2 in all selected pixels through visual inspection for images with evident sun glint this method was used for sun glint correction and the results are shown in fig s1 3 1 3 water area extraction both landsat tm and oli data include a pixel quality attributes qa band generated by the cfmask algorithm foga et al 2017 which includes quality statistics from image data and mask information of cloud and cloud shadow for the scene the landsat sr data also contain a radiometric saturation band that indicates which pixels are saturated oversaturated pixels are often unreliable owing to cloud snow and sun glint over water bodies dwyer et al 2018 all cloud cloud shadow and oversaturated pixels were excluded using these two bands for the remaining pixels the european commission s joint research centre jrc monthly water history v1 3 was used to identify the water boundaries of qinghai lake which contains maps of the location and temporal distribution of surface waters from 1984 to 2020 and provides statistical data on the extent and variability of these water surfaces pekel et al 2016 for modis data after removing cloud cloud shadow and low quality pixels using the qa band of mod09a1 wang et al 2021 an automatic thresholding method was used to extract the water areas based on the swir band zhang et al 2018 finally for each modis and landsat image of the water area a 500 m inward buffer was applied to avoid the potential influence of optically shallow water and ensure the quality of the water pixels after pre processing the color of water body pixels was retrieved by calculating the fui value the process flowchart of data preprocessing and fui product production is illustrated in fig 3 3 2 fui retrieval from landsat and modis data the fui is built on the cie xyz standard color system proposed by the international commission on illumination cie in which the three stimulus x y and z was derived first cie 1932 wang et al 2015 for mod09a1 and landsat tm data where only red green and blue bands were included in the visible domain a rgb conversion method was used to derive cie x y z wang et al 2015 2018 the conversion relationship is given by eq 4 x 2 7689 r rs red 1 7517 r rs green 1 1302 r rs blue y 1 0000 r rs red 4 5907 r rs green 0 0601 r rs blue 4 z 0 0000 r rs red 0 0565 r rs green 5 5943 r rs blue where r rs red r rs green and r rs blue are the water leaving reflectance of red green and blue bands of mod09a1 and landsat 5 tm respectively for landsat 8 oli with four bands in the visible bands an interpolation formula was used van der woerd and wernand 2018 x 11 053 r rs 443 6 950 r rs 483 51 135 r rs 561 34 457 r rs 661 y 1 320 r rs 443 21 053 r rs 483 66 023 r rs 561 18 034 r rs 661 5 z 58 038 r rs 443 34 931 r rs 483 2 606 r rs 561 0 016 r rs 661 where r rs 443 r rs 483 r rs 561 and r rs 661 are the water leaving reflectance of coastal blue green and red bands of landsat 8 oli to make it easier to visualize the color cie specifies a two dimensional chromaticity diagram fig 4 where x and y coordinates are calculated from three stimulus values xyz using eq 6 6 x x x y z y y x y z then a new coordinate system x y can be established based on the white point 1 3 1 3 in the two dimensional chromaticity diagram 7 x x 1 3 y y 1 3 based on the new coordinate system x y hue angle α can be calculated following the hue angle α defined in wang et al 2018 8 α arctan 2 x y 180 π 180 however because of the specific band setting of each sensor there is some deviation between the real color sensed by humans and the color derived by the sensors van der woerd and wernand 2018 2015 a delta correction is proposed by van der woerd and wernand 2018 to eliminate the difference of the hue angle α derived from the hyperspectral and equivalent landsat bands respectively using the method of van der woerd and wernand 2018 and based on the hydrolight dataset ioccg 2006 wang et al 2018 has developed a modis based hue angle a delta correction formula in this study a landsat based delta correction was developed based on the same method and data fig 5 the correction formula is different with that provided in van der woerd and wernand 2018 because an alternative definition of the hue angle a developed in wang et al 2018 is being used with this delta correction model hue angle a and fui are transferable between sensors with different band settings eq 9 shows the hue angle a correction formula for tm and oli the corrected hue angle a can be directly used to derive fui with the 21 level fui lookup table lut proposed by novoa et al 2013 δ α tm 29 045 b 5 156 91 b 4 279 9 b 3 128 18 b 2 103 81 b 34 578 9 δ α oli 52 819 b 5 334 88 b 4 758 26 b 3 746 32 b 2 315 18 b 39 761 the above fui retrieval method was applied to mod09a1 and landsat sr data for the calculation and statistics of qinghai lake fui only images from may to october were selected to avoid the effect of the ice cover period of qinghai lake for landsat only images with more than 60 available pixels of qinghai lake were used to further reduce the interference of low quality pixels and ensure the statistical reliability of fui the temporal distribution of the used landsat sr images is shown in fig 2 b finally a monthly mean fui image is calculated using the fui images of each month and the mean fui value of the whole lake in the monthly image represents the monthly scale fui the average of all monthly fui for a period i e one year is used as the fui for that period to reduce the effect of too small or lacking number of images in individual months yin et al 2021 to illustrate the representativeness of the mean statistics the median and mean fui of the whole lake based on modis monthly fui results between 2000 and 2020 were compared fig s2 a as well as the annual median and mean values of fui for qinghai lake in fig s2 b both have high consistency 3 3 evaluation of modis and landsat tm oli data to evaluate the performance of modis derived rrs in situ rrs was converted to the modis terra equivalent r rs λ i using eq 10 10 r rs λ i λ min λ max r rs λ rs r i λ d λ λ min λ max rs r i λ d λ where rs r i λ is the spectral response function of the modis terra sensor and λ min and λ max are the wavelength ranges of spectral response functions for each band mod09ga images for field survey days were downloaded and rrs retrievals at the sampling points were captured the match up data pairs were constructed by selecting the modis data not containing features of clouds cloud shadows and high spatial heterogeneity the spatial heterogeneity was checked by having a coefficient of variation i e standard deviation mean of less than 0 2 for a 3 3 modis pixel window centered on the sampling point at last there were 17 match up data pairs of rrs used for modis evaluation landsat tm and oli imagery were not assessed by in situ rrs data because of lack of images for the cruise survey dates to evaluate the consistency among the multi source satellite data the rrs of red green and blue bands and hue angle a derived from mod09ga data was compared with that derived from concurrent tm and oli data separately by randomly selecting 70 sampling points from both images for the same day fig 1 the selected dates for tm and modis data were 2001 7 20 2006 6 16 2007 8 22 and 2008 7 23 the selected dates for oli and modis were 2014 6 6 2016 7 29 and 2017 7 16 the accuracy assessment parameters including the root mean square error rmse median relative error mdre and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse are defined as follows 11 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 12 mdre median y i y i y i 100 13 nse 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 where y i and y i are the estimated and measured values of the ith sample point respectively and y i is the mean value of y i 3 4 analysis of changing trend and driving forces the mann kendall m k trend test hamed and rao 1998 mann 1945 was applied to analyze the changing trend of fui in qinghai lake from 1986 to 2020 the m k test uses a standardized z statistic to determine the monotonic trend of the data where z 0 indicates that the data has an upward trend and vice versa the resulting trends were considered significant only when the significance level p value was less than 0 05 the pearson correlation analysis was used to determine the correlation between hydrometeorological data and fui the pearson correlation coefficient between each driver and fui was calculated and student t test was used to obtain the significance level finally a stepwise regression method with forward selection was applied to identify the major driving factors influencing the water color change in qinghai lake smith 2018 the forward selection stepwise regression model starts with no variables and constructs the best multiple linear regression model by adding and selecting variables that can reduce akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 and improve the model fit 4 results and discussion 4 1 validation of multi source satellite data through comparison with in situ rrs it showed that the water leaving reflectance correction method performed well for modis data in qinghai lake fig 6 the rmse and mdre were 0 0024 sr 1 and 24 respectively we also compared the hue angle a from the satellite rrs with that from in situ rrs and found a mdre of 10 4 this indicates that the uncertainty can be significantly reduced in the calculation of water color parameters which is consistent with that described in wang et al 2021 given the good performance of modis derived rrs in qinghai lake a cross validation among modis landsat 5 tm and landsat 8 oli was conducted to assess the consistency among the sensors following the method described in section 3 3 fig 7 shows that landsat 8 is reasonably consistent with modis in the rgb bands and the derived hue angle a also has high agreement for landsat 5 the reflectance was obviously higher in the red band than that in mod09ga then the higher values of reflectance in the red band result in a higher hue angle a leading to a higher fui this indicates that although sensor errors caused by sensor spectral response differences can be eliminated by the delta correction fig 5 in the calculation of hue angle a the sensor calibration accuracy differences and atmospheric correction residuals may still lead to differences in reflectance in landsat 5 and landsat 8 che et al 2021 mishra et al 2016 vermote et al 2016 if these differences are not further evaluated and corrected they may lead to large systematic errors in long time series analysis therefore before analyzing the long time series variation a correction was made for the hue angle a derived from landsat 5 and landsat 8 according to the comparison 14 α tm 0 985 α tm 15 993 α oli 0 989 α oli 3 9024 with the correction for landsat 5 and landsat 8 high consistency was achieved among the landsat tm landsat oli and modis derived hue angle a and fui to further validate the consistency time series of monthly fui in qinghai lake derived from landsat series data and modis data were compared owing to the 16 day temporal resolution of landsat and the effect of cloud cover pixels for individual months there was no image available a total of 131 fui results were obtained from landsat tm oli for 210 months may october 1986 2020 of which 86 months from 2000 to 2020 were available it was found that landsat and modis data showed a good agreement on a monthly scale fig 8 slope 0 98 r 0 82 p 0 01 and the monthly variation trend over time was generally consistent nse 0 65 4 2 temporal spatial variation of water color in qinghai lake 4 2 1 temporal fui variations during 1986 2020 long time series of fui data were respectively constructed based on modis and landsat between may and october during 2000 2020 and 1986 2020 where high consistency was found as shown in fig 8 the temporal variations of fui in qinghai lake during 2000 2020 and 1986 2020 were then analyzed using these two datasets the annual changes of modis derived fui i e average value during may october from 2000 to 2020 in qinghai lake are shown in fig 9 a the results showed an overall fluctuating upward trend from 2000 to 2020 z 0 p 0 01 but a minimum value was identified in 2004 the fui showed a downward and upward trend before and after 2004 respectively fig 9 b shows the monthly change of fui from may to october based on modis where the monthly fui increases in the early months and reaches its highest value around september then decrease in october the changing trend of fui in qinghai lake is further analyzed based on landsat data from 1986 to 2020 as shown fig 10 there are some missing data in the landsat derived monthly fui time series since the time interval for landsat data is 16 days and there may be cloud cover during the satellite passing time given that the modis derived fui reached its minimum value in 2004 and the changing trend turned in that year the changing trends of fui before and after 2004 were further analyzed using the landsat results moreover several studies also demonstrated that 2004 was the year when the hydrological elements of qinghai lake had a major turnaround as water level and water area gradually decreased to their lowest values in this year and recovered rapidly after that due to the effects of climate change fan et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 therefore based on the longer time series of fui constructed by landsat the trend of fui changes was further analyzed before and after 2004 from 1986 to 2020 through the mann kendall m k trend test it was found that the fui of qinghai lake showed an significant decreased trend from 1986 to 2004 z 0 p 0 01 fig 10 and then a significant increasing trend after 2004 z 0 p 0 01 which is consistent with the modis result fig 10 4 2 2 spatial fui variation in qinghai lake the climatological mean fui in 1986 2020 and 2000 2020 derived from mod09 and landsat sr data respectively is mapped in fig 11 a and fig 11 b fig 11 c shows the mean statistics of these two spatial distributions in qinghai lake qhl and the subregions partitioned in fig 1 c i e buha estuary region ber the near shore region nsr and the lake central area lcr it is observed that the fui in ber is the highest the fui in nsr is higher than that of the whole lake and the fui in lcr is the lowest as shown in fig 11 d the four regions have a high consistency in the trend of fui changes over the past 35 years the spatial patterns of fui found by landsat and modis have high agreement although the nearshore effect of modis derived fui image seems to be more pronounced due to the lower resolution of modis than landsat the modis and landsat derived fui images was further compared on a finer scale fig 12 shows the landsat oli image of qinghai lake on 13 september 2015 and the corresponding landsat derived fui and modis derived fui maps on the same day at the buha river estuary and the eastern nearshore region the landsat images with 30 m spatial resolution provide more detailed features than modis with 500 m and result in less nearshore effects 4 3 forces driving fui changes in qinghai lake 4 3 1 interannual analysis of influencing factors as shown by the qlhc dataset in fig 13 along with the increase of air temperature as from 1986 to 2020 the water temperature rose rapidly after 2004 and the ice cover period shortened revealing an indisputable warming trend of qinghai lake the precipitation runoff and water level of the lake generally showed transitional changes where the turning points were around 2004 studies have found that the increase of runoff can lead to the rise of water temperature in the tp and this is probably the reason for dramatic increase of water temperature in qinghai lake in the early 2000 s wan et al 2018 with a substantial increase in total water vapor transport from the western pacific to mainland china after 2004 the precipitation and runoff in the qinghai lake basin show a rapid increase further leading to an increase in the water level in qinghai lake fan et al 2021 additionally windspeed around qinghai lake have fluctuated and changed over the past 35 years without a significant trend overall the qinghai lake basin has turned to be warmer and more humid climate in the first two decades of this century correlation analysis was used to determine which factors were associated with the fui variations over the past 35 years notably for landsat derived fui we divided the study period into 3 year periods i e 1986 1988 1989 1991 2016 2018 to reduce the bias caused by missing data in an individual year leaving the last two years from 2019 to 2020 as the final period as shown in fig 14 the fui has significant positive correlations with water temperature water level runoff and precipitation for the period of 2000 2020 and 1986 2020 respectively ranged from 0 65 to 0 78 p 0 05 and the temperature have a significant positive correlation with fui during 2000 to 2020 r 0 54 p 0 05 nevertheless the ice cover period and windspeed had no significant effect on the annual variation of fui due to the presence of multicollinearity among these environmental factors the stepwise regression method was used to determine the major factors impacting the water color variations of the lake an optimal standardized multiple linear regression model with only two variables precipitation and water temperature were established using this method eq 15 15 fu i std 0 316 pre c std 0 557 w t std r 2 0 62 p 0 001 where fu i std pre c std and w t std are the standardized fui precipitation and water temperature this reveals that precipitation and water temperature are the major factors affecting water color in qinghai lake from the standardized estimates of 0 316 and 0 557 the relative contributions of precipitation and water temperature to the model were calculated to be 36 and 64 respectively to further illustrate the effect of the two factors on different regions of the lake we calculated the correlation coefficients between precipitation and water temperature with fui in the three regions respectively see table 1 the fui in all three regions maintains a high positive correlation with precipitation and water temperature after the determination of the major environmental factors influencing the fui changes we attempted to analyze which water constituents specifically dominate the water color changes in qinghai lake based on the in situ measurements of chla tsm concentration a codm 440 and rrs from the sampling stations in the cruise survey in 2021 correlation analyses were performed for the hue angle a calculated from the rrs and the chla tsm concentration a codm 440 as shown in fig 15 the tsm concentration maintained a significant positive correlation with the hue angle a r 0 65 p 0 01 while the other two water constituents did not have much impact on hue angle a this indicates that the water color change of qinghai lake is mainly dominated by the change of tsm concentration in addition the cladophora blooms occurred frequently in the warm months in qinghai lake but were generally distributed along the shore and near the river estuary with a total area less than 10 km2 duan et al 2022 hence the blooms supposedly have very limited effect on the water color of the whole qinghai lake which has an area larger than 4300 km2 through the above analysis we speculate and summarize the mechanism underlying the response of the qinghai lake water color to climate change as follows the transitional change of water color in qinghai lake during the past 35 years was tightly related to the dramatic change of water temperature and precipitation in qinghai lake where the water temperature showed a larger contribution the water color changes in qinghai lake were mainly dominated by the change of tsm concentration while it is easy to understand the mechanism underlying the effect of precipitation on suspended matter in water because precipitation causes runoff which can bring in more sediments to the lake from the basin li et al 2010 the effect of water temperature on the suspended matter in water might be explained that the water temperature increase may change the lake mixing regimes in qinghai lake which could further lead to an increase in suspended matter and water color woolway et al 2020 4 3 2 interseasonal analysis of influencing factors to better analyze the driving factors of the seasonal variation in water color in qinghai lake monthly modis derived fui variation was divided into four periods may june july august september october and october may of the following year the mean values of temperature and precipitation for the first three periods were obtained separately using monthly meteorological data from the cmfd the fui increased in july august fig 16 a probably due to the increase in tsm concentration caused by increased temperature and precipitation in september october temperature and precipitation decreased yet fui continued to increase as shown in landsat images i e fig 17 the water color was generally more turbid in september than in august and the water in the estuary and around the lake contained more suspended matter previous studies have shown a significant lag effect of runoff relative to precipitation in qinghai lake cui et al 2011 and so the increase in fui during this period may have been influenced by precipitation in the previous period from october to may of the following year qinghai lake underwent an ice cover period during which temperature and precipitation were low approximately 5 c and 5 mm respectively as such the fui in may fuim is generally lower than that of october in the previous year fuio however from 2014 to 2018 fuim was higher than fuio fig 18 a and the ice cover period was significantly shortened the pearson correlation coefficient between the difference between fuim and fuio and the length of the ice cover period exhibits a significant negative correlation r 0 72 p 0 01 fig 18 b suggesting that the duration of the ice cover period has a marked effect on the variation of fui during this period although it does not have a significant effect on the annual fui as the ice cover period is also an indicator of water temperature this implies that the warming trend also affected the interseasonal changes of water color in qinghai lake 4 4 multi source satellite data for deriving water color and quality parameters both modis and landsat were used to derive the water color parameters in this study the high temporal resolution of modis provides sufficient data to analyze the monthly and annually fui while the 30 m spatial resolution and 40 years of observation time of landsat not only enable the long term tracking of water color in qinghai lake but also help assess the finer spatial characteristics of water color the combined use of multi source satellite data i e modis and landsat can substantially improve the reliability of captured spatiotemporal variations in water color it is noteworthy that the cross validation among satellite sensors such as the landsat tm landsat oli and modis is a necessary step before the combined use of multi source data to reduce the difference of spectral band configurations and radiometric sensitivity che et al 2021 song et al 2017 therefore a further correction was proposed for the landsat data to improve the consistency of time series data derived through with the multi source data in this study additionally we note that a deeper fusion of multi source data may further support the derivation of longer time series of higher resolution water quality monitoring results and improve spatial and temporal continuity of observations gao et al 2017 yan et al 2018 which remains to be studied in the future water color parameters represented by fui have been widely used in large scale water quality monitoring due to their capability in indicating the bulk water quality and transferability among multi source satellite data van der woerd and wernand 2015 wang et al 2021 although the substances that dominate water color may vary for different water bodies the relationship between water turbidity and water color seems to be quite robust in lakes wang et al 2020 as supported by the in situ data analysis in this study however nor water color or turbidity cannot directly indicate the specific substance change in water as both are comprehensive indicators of water quality the specific changes of water constituents in lakes may be more conducive to the exploration of the interaction mechanism between lake environment and climate change hence a robust water constituent retrieval scheme still remains to be studied based on multi source satellite data the combination of multi source remote sensing data in this study and the mechanism analysis underlying the effects of climate change on water color can provide valuable references for other studies combining multi source data to analyze the response of lake environment to climate change in long time series 5 conclusions in this study fui as a proxy for water color in qinghai lake was derived using both landsat and modis data and the multi source satellite data in derivation of fui was evaluated and compared a correction was developed for the landsat data to achieved strong monthly level agreement between modis and landsat sensors which improves the consistency of long term time series of water color derived through satellites finally the spatial and temporal variations in the fui of qinghai lake from 1986 to 2020 were analyzed by combining the modis and landsat results taking 2004 as the turning point the fui had a significant decreasing trend in qinghai lake from 1986 to 2004 and then a significant increasing trend from 2004 to 2020 the increase of water temperature and precipitation were the major factors influencing the long term changes of water color while runoff water level and temperature were highly correlated with fui during the past 35 years the tsm concentration dominates the water color change in the qinghai lake water color of the qinghai lake also varies considerably between seasons where temperature precipitation and ice cover period all have considerable influences on the seasonal variations the water color variations in qinghai lake during the past 35 years reflect one response mode of water

7916,study region qinghai lake qinghai tibet plateau china study focus water color has been recognized as an essential climate variable for lakes and oceans forel ule index fui as one representative water color quantization parameter is a useful indicator that shows water turbidity variations in lakes in this study the time series of fui images were constructed for qinghai lake the largest salt water lake in china from 1986 to 2020 based on landsat and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data the multi source satellite data were first evaluated and compared with regard to the derivation of fui then the spatial and temporal variations of water color in qinghai lake and its driving forces were analyzed new hydrological insights for the region the results revealed that the fui showed a significant decreasing trend in qinghai lake from 1986 to 2004 and a significant increasing trend from 2004 to 2020 which temporally coincided with the water level variations in qinghai lake the water level water temperature precipitation and runoff were strongly correlated with the changes of fui correlation coefficients of 0 65 0 78 the substantial increases in precipitation and water temperature after 2004 can be the major causes for the transitional increase of water color in qinghai lake this reflects one response mode of water quality in lakes to climate change graphical abstract ga1 keywords qinghai lake fui water color long term change climate change 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp and its surrounding areas are referred to as the third pole of the earth where a large number of lakes are widely and densely distributed sun et al 2018 due to the harsh environment on the tp lakes in the region are rarely affected by human activities and are known as the sentinels and indicators of climate change zhu et al 2019 the temperature of the tibetan plateau is increasing at a rate of 0 46 c decade in the past decades which is 1 5 fold higher than the global rate zhang et al 2013 the increase in temperature accelerates the melting of glaciers and permafrost degradation and shortens the ice cover periods of lakes together these factors also affect the water temperature of lakes kuang and jiao 2016 wan et al 2018 the precipitation over the tibetan plateau has increased over the decades which together with the glacial meltwater has resulted in more runoff as well as lakes expansion and rising water levels zhang et al 2020 as a result of the rapid climate change lakes on the tp are significantly evolving in terms of water volume water temperature and ice phenology qinghai lake is the largest lake on the tp it plays an important role in the surrounding semi arid ecosystem fan et al 2021 studies have shown that qinghai lake is experiencing rapid water environment change due to the global warming and the local wet dry hydrological transition during the last half century chang et al 2017 tang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 the water level of the lake has changed dramatically over the past 50 years in a seesaw pattern fan et al 2021 fang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 the freezing dates of qinghai lake have been delayed the ablation dates have been earlier in the past 40 years and the ice cover period has decreased by almost 21 days cai et al 2017 most of the studies have been conducted on the analyses and understanding of changes in traditional hydrological parameters but there is limited literature on the long term time series of water quality variations in qinghai lake the impact of climate change on water quality change in this lake during the last half century remains unclear along with water level and water temperature water color has been recognized by global climate observing system gcos as an essential climate variable for both lakes and oceans which can be used to track the long term variability of the aquatic system in response to climate change wang et al 2021 water color is the outcome of interactions between water constituents i e chlorophyll a chla colored dissolved organic matter cdom total suspended matter tsm and sunlight garaba et al 2015 wang et al 2015 wernand et al 2013 water color can indicate the water turbidity changes in lakes wang et al 2020 the variations of the lake s hydro meteorological factors would inevitably affect the material and energy dynamics of the lake and therefore influence its water color forel ule index fui which classifies water color into 21 classes from dark blue to yellowish brown is the most important water color quantization parameter and has been used by oceanographers and limnologists since the 19th century novoa et al 2013 the use of fui can characterize the water color and water quality changes in lakes and oceans wernand et al 2013 studies have shown that fui derived from satellite data have low uncertainty and can be theoretically transferred between different sensors van der woerd and wernand 2018 2015 wang et al 2018 fui has played an increasingly important role in recent years for large scale and long term water quality monitoring the transferability of fui between satellite sensors also provides an advantage in combining multi source satellite data for obtaining more reliable spatial and temporal variations of water quality in this study fui was derived using both moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis and landsat tm oli data to track the long term water quality change in qinghai lake during the past 35 years for the first time the consistency between multi source satellite data in the derivation of time series of fui was evaluated the long term changing variations of fui in qinghai lake were identified and analyzed using the multi source data and the impact of climate change on the water color changes of qinghai lake was explored and discussed 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area located in the northeast of tp 36 32 37 15 n 99 37 100 47 e qinghai lake has an mean altitude of 3260 m covers an area of approximately 4265 km2 and is 104 km long e w 62 km wide n s zhang song et al 2019 and has an average water depth of 21 m ao et al 2014 li et al 2006 the average annual temperature of qinghai lake is between 0 9 and 1 4 and the average annual precipitation fluctuates between 260 and 572 mm qinghai lake is a closed basin lake with no outflow and is recharged mainly by direct precipitation and runoff from more than 50 intermittent rivers among which buha river is the main source the qinghai lake basin is one of the most sensitive areas to global climate change chang et al 2017 yuan et al 2012 fig 1 presents the location of the qinghai lake and the meteorological and hydrological stations near the lake meanwhile the in situ measurement stations random sampling points and subregion partition for qinghai lake are shown in the figure 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 landsat data landsat data managed by the united states geological survey usgs provide a 40 year record of space based land cover change observations irons et al 2012 including the capacity for water quality monitoring at a 30 m resolution barnes et al 2015 all landsat surface reflectance sr data l1tp covering qinghai lake are available on google earth engine gee https earthengine google com gorelick et al 2017 landsat sr data include atmospheric corrected surface reflectance and surface temperature obtained from the thematic mapper tm enhanced tm plus etm and operational land imager oli sensors respectively landsat 5 7 sr products were created using the landsat ecosystem disturbance adaptive processing system ledaps algorithm woerd and wernand 2015 landsat 8 sr products were created using the land surface reflectance code lasrc vermote et al 2016 the tm covers the period from january 1984 to may 2012 etm covers the period from may 1999 to april 2022 and oli covers the period from april 2013 to present as the etm slc failed on 31 may 2003 etm images were not used there is no image available in qinghai lake in 1984 and 1985 so only images from 1986 were collected 2 2 2 modis data modis data have daily coverage high sensitivity and cost free distribution but are limited to low spatial resolution of 500 m to 1 km and are only traceable after 2000 wu et al 2008 the modis product mod09a1 is an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance that provides bands 1 7 in the 8 day composite gridded l3 product in the sinusoidal projection including 500 m reflectance values and 1 km observation and geolocation statistics all mod09a1 data covering qinghai lake were collected from gee to derive fui images by the method of wang et al 2021 the daily product mod09ga was also used to pair with the in situ data and evaluate the consistency among landsat 5 landsat 8 and modis 2 2 3 hydro meteorological data qinghai lake hydrology and climate data 1956 2020 qlhc and the china meteorological forcing dataset 1979 2018 cmfd were downloaded from the national tibetan plateau third pole environment data center http data tpdc ac cn to analyze factors associated with fui variation qlhc includes annual water level water temperature runoff ice cover period precipitation and temperature these data were collected through gauge stations near qinghai lake gangcha xiashe and buha stations shown in fig 1 zhang 2021 cmfd was made through the fusion of remote sensing products a reanalysis dataset and in situ observational data from meteorological stations which is less accurate than the observed data kun and jie 2019 cmfd provides data for each month and the precipitation temperature and windspeed in cmfd were used for auxiliary analysis 2 2 4 in situ measurements spectral data for sampling stations fig 1 were measured by cruise surveys on 23 24 august 2014 and 15 17 july 2021 using a ger 1500 spectrometer wavelength range 350 1050 nm and asd fieldspec spectroradiometer wavelength range 350 2500 nm the above water method was used to measure water leaving reflectance rrs above the water surface mobley 1999 mueller et al 2003 tang et al 2004 after measuring the radiance of the water body l s w λ sky light l s k y λ and gray panel l p λ r rs λ were calculated as follows 1 r rs λ l w λ e d λ l sw λ r sky l sky λ π l p λ ρ p λ where λ is the wavelength l w λ is the water leaving radiance e d λ is the downlink irradiance r sky is the reflectance of sky light at the air water interface which can be derived from the lut mobley 1999 and ρ p λ is the standard panel reflectance along with the water surface spectrum collection water samples were collected in the cruise survey in 2021 the chla and tsm concentration and the absorption coefficient of cdom at 440 nm a codm 440 were determined in the lab following the methods described in relevant protocols mueller et al 2003 a summary of the timelines for the cruise surveys hydro meteorological data and landsat data are shown in fig 2 the modis data was not shown in the figure because the data is represented on a daily basis and there an insignificant difference in the number of images used among the years 3 methods 3 1 satellite data preprocessing 3 1 1 water leaving reflectance correction for modis and landsat data although the landsat and modis sr data perform well on land feng et al 2013 vuolo et al 2015 there is no accurate water leaving reflectance correction for water bodies vuolo et al 2015 a simple correction method for calculating water leaving reflectance from sr data was used in this study for both landsat and modis data to remove the residual noises in the sr data wang et al 2016 despite some limitations this method offers easy implementation and stable performance over lakes wang et al 2016 yin et al 2021 and can be calculated as follows 2 r rs λ r λ min r nir r swir π where r rs λ is water leaving reflectance r λ is the original reflectance of landsat and modis and min r nir r swir is the minimum positive reflectance value for the nir and swir bands 3 1 2 sun glint correction for landsat data sun glint is a serious interference factor for remote sensing of water properties especially for satellite data with high spatial resolution such as landsat and sentinel 2 data abascal zorrilla et al 2019 kay et al 2009 in some landsat images severe sun glint caused by specular reflection can result in unusually large brightness values in all the bands which can further bring in large uncertainties in the water color derivation overstreet and legleiter 2016 in this study a method proposed by abascal zorrilla et al 2019 to correct sun glint from landsat 8 images was used by establishing the linear relationship between swir2 and visible bands this method is based on the assumption that the amount of sun glint in the visible bands is linearly related to the brightness in the swir band by selecting pixels in the region where the sun glint is evident the following relationship is established 3 r i r i b i r swir 2 mi n swir 2 where r i is the corrected surface reflectance at band i r i is the original reflectance at band i r swir 2 is the reflectance in swir2 b i is the slope of the linear regression equation between r i and r swir 2 and mi n swir 2 is the minimum value of r swir 2 in all selected pixels through visual inspection for images with evident sun glint this method was used for sun glint correction and the results are shown in fig s1 3 1 3 water area extraction both landsat tm and oli data include a pixel quality attributes qa band generated by the cfmask algorithm foga et al 2017 which includes quality statistics from image data and mask information of cloud and cloud shadow for the scene the landsat sr data also contain a radiometric saturation band that indicates which pixels are saturated oversaturated pixels are often unreliable owing to cloud snow and sun glint over water bodies dwyer et al 2018 all cloud cloud shadow and oversaturated pixels were excluded using these two bands for the remaining pixels the european commission s joint research centre jrc monthly water history v1 3 was used to identify the water boundaries of qinghai lake which contains maps of the location and temporal distribution of surface waters from 1984 to 2020 and provides statistical data on the extent and variability of these water surfaces pekel et al 2016 for modis data after removing cloud cloud shadow and low quality pixels using the qa band of mod09a1 wang et al 2021 an automatic thresholding method was used to extract the water areas based on the swir band zhang et al 2018 finally for each modis and landsat image of the water area a 500 m inward buffer was applied to avoid the potential influence of optically shallow water and ensure the quality of the water pixels after pre processing the color of water body pixels was retrieved by calculating the fui value the process flowchart of data preprocessing and fui product production is illustrated in fig 3 3 2 fui retrieval from landsat and modis data the fui is built on the cie xyz standard color system proposed by the international commission on illumination cie in which the three stimulus x y and z was derived first cie 1932 wang et al 2015 for mod09a1 and landsat tm data where only red green and blue bands were included in the visible domain a rgb conversion method was used to derive cie x y z wang et al 2015 2018 the conversion relationship is given by eq 4 x 2 7689 r rs red 1 7517 r rs green 1 1302 r rs blue y 1 0000 r rs red 4 5907 r rs green 0 0601 r rs blue 4 z 0 0000 r rs red 0 0565 r rs green 5 5943 r rs blue where r rs red r rs green and r rs blue are the water leaving reflectance of red green and blue bands of mod09a1 and landsat 5 tm respectively for landsat 8 oli with four bands in the visible bands an interpolation formula was used van der woerd and wernand 2018 x 11 053 r rs 443 6 950 r rs 483 51 135 r rs 561 34 457 r rs 661 y 1 320 r rs 443 21 053 r rs 483 66 023 r rs 561

landsat 8 oli to make it easier to visualize the color cie specifies a two dimensional chromaticity diagram fig 4 where x and y coordinates are calculated from three stimulus values xyz using eq 6 6 x x x y z y y x y z then a new coordinate system x y can be established based on the white point 1 3 1 3 in the two dimensional chromaticity diagram 7 x x 1 3 y y 1 3 based on the new coordinate system x y hue angle α can be calculated following the hue angle α defined in wang et al 2018 8 α arctan 2 x y 180 π 180 however because of the specific band setting of each sensor there is some deviation between the real color sensed by humans and the color derived by the sensors van der woerd and wernand 2018 2015 a delta correction is proposed by van der woerd and wernand 2018 to eliminate the difference of the hue angle α derived from the hyperspectral and equivalent landsat bands respectively using the method of van der woerd and wernand 2018 and based on the hydrolight dataset ioccg 2006 wang et al 2018 has developed a modis based hue angle a delta correction formula in this study a landsat based delta correction was developed based on the same method and data fig 5 the correction formula is different with that provided in van der woerd and wernand 2018 because an alternative definition of the hue angle a developed in wang et al 2018 is being used with this delta correction model hue angle a and fui are transferable between sensors with different band settings eq 9 shows the hue angle a correction formula for tm and oli the corrected hue angle a can be directly used to derive fui with the 21 level fui lookup table lut proposed by novoa et al 2013 δ α tm 29 045 b 5 156 91 b 4 279 9 b 3 128 18 b 2 103 81 b 34 578 9 δ α oli 52 819 b 5 334 88 b 4 758 26 b 3 746 32 b 2 315 18 b 39 761 the above fui retrieval method was applied to mod09a1 and landsat sr data for the calculation and statistics of qinghai lake fui only images from may to october were selected to avoid the effect of the ice cover period of qinghai lake for landsat only images with more than 60 available pixels of qinghai lake were used to further reduce the interference of low quality pixels and ensure the statistical reliability of fui the temporal distribution of the used landsat sr images is shown in fig 2 b finally a monthly mean fui image is calculated using the fui images of each month and the mean fui value of the whole lake in the monthly image represents the monthly scale fui the average of all monthly fui for a period i e one year is used as the fui for that period to reduce the effect of too small or lacking number of images in individual months yin et al 2021 to illustrate the representativeness of the mean statistics the median and mean fui of the whole lake based on modis monthly fui results between 2000 and 2020 were compared fig s2 a as well as the annual median and mean values of fui for qinghai lake in fig s2 b both have high consistency 3 3 evaluation of modis and landsat tm oli data to evaluate the performance of modis derived rrs in situ rrs was converted to the modis terra equivalent r rs λ i using eq 10 10 r rs λ i λ min λ max r rs λ rs r i λ d λ λ min λ max rs r i λ d λ where rs r i λ is the spectral response function of the modis terra sensor and λ min and λ max are the wavelength ranges of spectral response functions for each band mod09ga images for field survey days were downloaded and rrs retrievals at the sampling points were captured the match up data pairs were constructed by selecting the modis data not containing features of clouds cloud shadows and high spatial heterogeneity the spatial heterogeneity was checked by having a coefficient of variation i e standard deviation mean of less than 0 2 for a 3 3 modis pixel window centered on the sampling point at last there were 17 match up data pairs of rrs used for modis evaluation landsat tm and oli imagery were not assessed by in situ rrs data because of lack of images for the cruise survey dates to evaluate the consistency among the multi source satellite data the rrs of red green and blue bands and hue angle a derived from mod09ga data was compared with that derived from concurrent tm and oli data separately by randomly selecting 70 sampling points from both images for the same day fig 1 the selected dates for tm and modis data were 2001 7 20 2006 6 16 2007 8 22 and 2008 7 23 the selected dates for oli and modis were 2014 6 6 2016 7 29 and 2017 7 16 the accuracy assessment parameters including the root mean square error rmse median relative error mdre and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse are defined as follows 11 rmse 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 12 mdre median y i y i y i 100 13 nse 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 where y i and y i are the estimated and measured values of the ith sample point respectively and y i is the mean value of y i 3 4 analysis of changing trend and driving forces the mann kendall m k trend test hamed and rao 1998 mann 1945 was applied to analyze the changing trend of fui in qinghai lake from 1986 to 2020 the m k test uses a standardized z statistic to determine the monotonic trend of the data where z 0 indicates that the data has an upward trend and vice versa the resulting trends were considered significant only when the significance level p value was less than 0 05 the pearson correlation analysis was used to determine the correlation between hydrometeorological data and fui the pearson correlation coefficient between each driver and fui was calculated and student t test was used to obtain the significance level finally a stepwise regression method with forward selection was applied to identify the major driving factors influencing the water color change in qinghai lake smith 2018 the forward selection stepwise regression model starts with no variables and constructs the best multiple linear regression model by adding and selecting variables that can reduce akaike information criterion aic akaike 1974 and improve the model fit 4 results and discussion 4 1 validation of multi source satellite data through comparison with in situ rrs it showed that the water leaving reflectance correction method performed well for modis data in qinghai lake fig 6 the rmse and mdre were 0 0024 sr 1 and 24 respectively we also compared the hue angle a from the satellite rrs with that from in situ rrs and found a mdre of 10 4 this indicates that the uncertainty can be significantly reduced in the calculation of water color parameters which is consistent with that described in wang et al 2021 given the good performance of modis derived rrs in qinghai lake a cross validation among modis landsat 5 tm and landsat 8 oli was conducted to assess the consistency among the sensors following the method described in section 3 3 fig 7 shows that landsat 8 is reasonably consistent with modis in the rgb bands and the derived hue angle a also has high agreement for landsat 5 the reflectance was obviously higher in the red band than that in mod09ga then the higher values of reflectance in the red band result in a higher hue angle a leading to a higher fui this indicates that although sensor errors caused by sensor spectral response differences can be eliminated by the delta correction fig 5 in the calculation of hue angle a the sensor calibration accuracy differences and atmospheric correction residuals may still lead to differences in reflectance in landsat 5 and landsat 8 che et al 2021 mishra et al 2016 vermote et al 2016 if these differences are not further evaluated and corrected they may lead to large systematic errors in long time series analysis therefore before analyzing the long time series variation a correction was made for the hue angle a derived from landsat 5 and landsat 8 according to the comparison 14 α tm 0 985 α tm 15 993 α oli 0 989 α oli 3 9024 with the correction for landsat 5 and landsat 8 high consistency was achieved among the landsat tm landsat oli and modis derived hue angle a and fui to further validate the consistency time series of monthly fui in qinghai lake derived from landsat series data and modis data were compared owing to the 16 day temporal resolution of landsat and the effect of cloud cover pixels for individual months there was no image available a total of 131 fui results were obtained from landsat tm oli for 210 months may october 1986 2020 of which 86 months from 2000 to 2020 were available it was found that landsat and modis data showed a good agreement on a monthly scale fig 8 slope 0 98 r 0 82 p 0 01 and the monthly variation trend over time was generally consistent nse 0 65 4 2 temporal spatial variation of water color in qinghai lake 4 2 1 temporal fui variations during 1986 2020 long time series of fui data were respectively constructed based on modis and landsat between may and october during 2000 2020 and 1986 2020 where high consistency was found as shown in fig 8 the temporal variations of fui in qinghai lake during 2000 2020 and 1986 2020 were then analyzed using these two datasets the annual changes of modis derived fui i e average value during may october from 2000 to 2020 in qinghai lake are shown in fig 9 a the results showed an overall fluctuating upward trend from 2000 to 2020 z 0 p 0 01 but a minimum value was identified in 2004 the fui showed a downward and upward trend before and after 2004 respectively fig 9 b shows the monthly change of fui from may to october based on modis where the monthly fui increases in the early months and reaches its highest value around september then decrease in october the changing trend of fui in qinghai lake is further analyzed based on landsat data from 1986 to 2020 as shown fig 10 there are some missing data in the landsat derived monthly fui time series since the time interval for landsat data is 16 days and there may be cloud cover during the satellite passing time given that the modis derived fui reached its minimum value in 2004 and the changing trend turned in that year the changing trends of fui before and after 2004 were further analyzed using the landsat results moreover several studies also demonstrated that 2004 was the year when the hydrological elements of qinghai lake had a major turnaround as water level and water area gradually decreased to their lowest values in this year and recovered rapidly after that due to the effects of climate change fan et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 therefore based on the longer time series of fui constructed by landsat the trend of fui changes was further analyzed before and after 2004 from 1986 to 2020 through the mann kendall m k trend test it was found that the fui of qinghai lake showed an significant decreased trend from 1986 to 2004 z 0 p 0 01 fig 10 and then a significant increasing trend after 2004 z 0 p 0 01 which is consistent with the modis result fig 10 4 2 2 spatial fui variation in qinghai lake the climatological mean fui in 1986 2020 and 2000 2020 derived from mod09 and landsat sr data respectively is mapped in fig 11 a and fig 11 b fig 11 c shows the mean statistics of these two spatial distributions in qinghai lake qhl and the subregions partitioned in fig 1 c i e buha estuary region ber the near shore region nsr and the lake central area lcr it is observed that the fui in ber is the highest the fui in nsr is higher than that of the whole lake and the fui in lcr is the lowest as shown in fig 11 d the four regions have a high consistency in the trend of fui changes over the past 35 years the spatial patterns of fui found by landsat and modis have high agreement although the nearshore effect of modis derived fui image seems to be more pronounced due to the lower resolution of modis than landsat the modis and landsat derived fui images was further compared on a finer scale fig 12 shows the landsat oli image of qinghai lake on 13 september 2015 and the corresponding landsat derived fui and modis derived fui maps on the same day at the buha river estuary and the eastern nearshore region the landsat images with 30 m spatial resolution provide more detailed features than modis with 500 m and result in less nearshore effects 4 3 forces driving fui changes in qinghai lake 4 3 1 interannual analysis of influencing factors as shown by the qlhc dataset in fig 13 along with the increase of air temperature as from 1986 to 2020 the water temperature rose rapidly after 2004 and the ice cover period shortened revealing an indisputable warming trend of qinghai lake the precipitation runoff and water level of the lake generally showed transitional changes where the turning points were around 2004 studies have found that the increase of runoff can lead to the rise of water temperature in the tp and this is probably the reason for dramatic increase of water temperature in qinghai lake in the early 2000 s wan et al 2018 with a substantial increase in total water vapor transport from the western pacific to mainland china after 2004 the precipitation and runoff in the qinghai lake basin show a rapid increase further leading to an increase in the water level in qinghai lake fan et al 2021 additionally windspeed around qinghai lake have fluctuated and changed over the past 35 years without a significant trend overall the qinghai lake basin has turned to be warmer and more humid climate in the first two decades of this century correlation analysis was used to determine which factors were associated with the fui variations over the past 35 years notably for landsat derived fui we divided the study period into 3 year periods i e 1986 1988 1989 1991 2016 2018 to reduce the bias caused by missing data in an individual year leaving the last two years from 2019 to 2020 as the final period as shown in fig 14 the fui has significant positive correlations with water temperature water level runoff and precipitation for the period of 2000 2020 and 1986 2020 respectively ranged from 0 65 to 0 78 p 0 05 and the temperature have a significant positive correlation with fui during 2000 to 2020 r 0 54 p 0 05 nevertheless the ice cover period and windspeed had no significant effect on the annual variation of fui due to the presence of multicollinearity among these environmental factors the stepwise regression method was used to determine the major factors impacting the water color variations of the lake an optimal standardized multiple linear regression model with only two variables precipitation and water temperature were established using this method eq 15 15 fu i std 0 316 pre c std 0 557 w t std r 2 0 62 p 0 001 where fu i std pre c std and w t std are the standardized fui precipitation and water temperature this reveals that precipitation and water temperature are the major factors affecting water color in qinghai lake from the standardized estimates of 0 316 and 0 557 the relative contributions of precipitation and water temperature to the model were calculated to be 36 and 64 respectively to further illustrate the effect of the two factors on different regions of the lake we calculated the correlation coefficients between precipitation and water temperature with fui in the three regions respectively see table 1 the fui in all three regions maintains a high positive correlation with precipitation and water temperature after the determination of the major environmental factors influencing the fui changes we attempted to analyze which water constituents specifically dominate the water color changes in qinghai lake based on the in situ measurements of chla tsm concentration a codm 440 and rrs from the sampling stations in the cruise survey in 2021 correlation analyses were performed for the hue angle a calculated from the rrs and the chla tsm concentration a codm 440 as shown in fig 15 the tsm concentration maintained a significant positive correlation with the hue angle a r 0 65 p 0 01 while the other two water constituents did not have much impact on hue angle a this indicates that the water color change of qinghai lake is mainly dominated by the change of tsm concentration in addition the cladophora blooms occurred frequently in the warm months in qinghai lake but were generally distributed along the shore and near the river estuary with a total area less than 10 km2 duan et al 2022 hence the blooms supposedly have very limited effect on the water color of the whole qinghai lake which has an area larger than 4300 km2 through the above analysis we speculate and summarize the mechanism underlying the response of the qinghai lake water color to climate change as follows the transitional change of water color in qinghai lake during the past 35 years was tightly related to the dramatic change of water temperature and precipitation in qinghai lake where the water temperature showed a larger contribution the water color changes in qinghai lake were mainly dominated by the change of tsm concentration while it is easy to understand the mechanism underlying the effect of precipitation on suspended matter in water because precipitation causes runoff which can bring in more sediments to the lake from the basin li et al 2010 the effect of water temperature on the suspended matter in water might be explained that the water temperature increase may change the lake mixing regimes in qinghai lake which could further lead to an increase in suspended matter and water color woolway et al 2020 4 3 2 interseasonal analysis of influencing factors to better analyze the driving factors of the seasonal variation in water color in qinghai lake monthly modis derived fui variation was divided into four periods may june july august september october and october may of the following year the mean values of temperature and precipitation for the first three periods were obtained separately using monthly meteorological data from the cmfd the fui increased in july august fig 16 a probably due to the increase in tsm concentration caused by increased temperature and precipitation in september october temperature and precipitation decreased yet fui continued to increase as shown in landsat images i e fig 17 the water color was generally more turbid in september than in august and the water in the estuary and around the lake contained more suspended matter previous studies have shown a significant lag effect of runoff relative to precipitation in qinghai lake cui et al 2011 and so the increase in fui during this period may have been influenced by precipitation in the previous period from october to may of the following year qinghai lake underwent an ice cover period during which temperature and precipitation were low approximately 5 c and 5 mm respectively as such the fui in may fuim is generally lower than that of october in the previous year fuio however from 2014 to 2018 fuim was higher than fuio fig 18 a and the ice cover period was significantly shortened the pearson correlation coefficient between the difference between fuim and fuio and the length of the ice cover period exhibits a significant negative correlation r 0 72 p 0 01 fig 18 b suggesting that the duration of the ice cover period has a marked effect on the variation of fui during this period although it does not have a significant effect on the annual fui as the ice cover period is also an indicator of water temperature this implies that the warming trend also affected the interseasonal changes of water color in qinghai lake 4 4 multi source satellite data for deriving water color and quality parameters both modis and landsat were used to derive the water color parameters in this study the high temporal resolution of modis provides sufficient data to analyze the monthly and annually fui while the 30 m spatial resolution and 40 years of observation time of landsat not only enable the long term tracking of water color in qinghai lake but also help assess the finer spatial characteristics of water color the combined use of multi source satellite data i e modis and landsat can substantially improve the reliability of captured spatiotemporal variations in water color it is noteworthy that the cross validation among satellite sensors such as the landsat tm landsat oli and modis is a necessary step before the combined use of multi source data to reduce the difference of spectral band configurations and radiometric sensitivity che et al 2021 song et al 2017 therefore a further correction was proposed for the landsat data to improve the consistency of time series data derived through with the multi source data in this study additionally we note that a deeper fusion of multi source data may further support the derivation of longer time series of higher resolution water quality monitoring results and improve spatial and temporal continuity of observations gao et al 2017 yan et al 2018 which remains to be studied in the future water color parameters represented by fui have been widely used in large scale water quality monitoring due to their capability in indicating the bulk water quality and transferability among multi source satellite data van der woerd and wernand 2015 wang et al 2021 although the substances that dominate water color may vary for different water bodies the relationship between water turbidity and water color seems to be quite robust in lakes wang et al 2020 as supported by the in situ data analysis in this study however nor water color or turbidity cannot directly indicate the specific substance change in water as both are comprehensive indicators of water quality the specific changes of water constituents in lakes may be more conducive to the exploration of the interaction mechanism between lake environment and climate change hence a robust water constituent retrieval scheme still remains to be studied based on multi source satellite data the combination of multi source remote sensing data in this study and the mechanism analysis underlying the effects of climate change on water color can provide valuable references for other studies combining multi source data to analyze the response of lake environment to climate change in long time series 5 conclusions in this study fui as a proxy for water color in qinghai lake was derived using both landsat and modis data and the multi source satellite data in derivation of fui was evaluated and compared a correction was developed for the landsat data to achieved strong monthly level agreement between modis and landsat sensors which improves the consistency of long term time series of water color derived through satellites finally the spatial and temporal variations in the fui of qinghai lake from 1986 to 2020 were analyzed by combining the modis and landsat results taking 2004 as the turning point the fui had a significant decreasing trend in qinghai lake from 1986 to 2004 and then a significant increasing trend from 2004 to 2020 the increase of water temperature and precipitation were the major factors influencing the long term changes of water color while runoff water level and temperature were highly correlated with fui during the past 35 years the tsm concentration dominates the water color change in the qinghai lake water color of the qinghai lake also varies considerably between seasons where temperature precipitation and ice cover period all have considerable influences on the seasonal variations the water color variations in qinghai lake during the past 35 years reflect one response mode of water

2021 however nutrient pollution is indeed a major contributor to river degradation eea 2018 carvalho et al 2019 while agricultural and urban land uses are associated to important diffuse sources of nutrients effluents of wwtps can also significantly contribute to nutrient loads in downstream reaches despite the extensive treatment of wastewater prior to discharge in receiving waters the impact of effluents from wwtps could be even more prominent during dry periods in semi arid and arid areas since most of the flow in the river channel is mainly composed of wwtp effluent dennehy et al 1998 passell et al 2005 carey and migliaccio 2009 maier et al 2009 lópez doval et al 2013 ladapo and aminu 2017 preisner et al 2020 recognizing the importance of freshwater conservation several programs and agreements such as the european water framework directive the u s clean water act the minamata convention the international commission for the protection of the rhine and the chinese grain for green program have been developed to protect river biodiversity and ecosystem functioning however more efforts are still required to implement such policies as many water bodies have not reached the acceptable water quality standards yet in europe for instance around 60 of surface water bodies failed to achieve the good ecological status in 2018 and it is predicted that achieving the desired

climate and land use in another study schmalz et al 2015 suggested that the species richness would be affected by deforestation in the changjiang river watershed china the results of a study conducted in turkey indicate that the richness and composition of macroinvertebrates in the kucuk menderes river vary as the river becomes polluted by flowing through residential industrial and agricultural areas arslan et al 2016 mesgaran karimi et al 2016 also showed that the effluents of two trout farms have significantly decreased the diversity of macroinvertebrates in the dohezar stream iran river ecological assessment has progressed significantly in the last few decades poikane et al 2021 in europe the water framework directive wfd 2000 60 ec is the main legislation for achieving good ecological status and the relationships between nutrients biological structure and ecological status in rivers are explored based on the concept behind the wfd kelly et al 2009 poikane et al 2020 most of the studies conducted on river biodiversity e g al shami et al 2011 arslan et al 2016 mesgaran karimi et al 2016 menció and boix 2018 are based on datasets resulting from river sampling campaigns in addition to the knowledge derived from these experimental studies watershed scale models have the capability to complement these studies by investigating the response of freshwater ecosystem to different environmental stressors at various places and times other than the sampled ones and also to strengthen our understanding by predicting the ecosystem response to different stressor scenarios thus the main objective of the present study is to evaluate the potential of an integrated modeling approach in predicting the water quality and the ecological response to different hydrological management scenarios in particular in the current work the swat soil and water assessment tool software is used to build an ecohydrological model of an agricultural catchment in spain and the evaluation of ecological conditions of stream network are evaluated by coupling outputs of the swat model and regressions between nutrients concentrations and macroinvertebrate based metrics the chosen approach allows to quantify model uncertainty which has been discussed as a crucial step for watershed modeling abbaspour et al 2015 2 materials and methods an ecohydrological modeling approach is developed in the present study to evaluate ecological status of the albaida valley streams for this purpose 1 a variety of information is collected to characterize the case study 2 the swat model arnold et al 1998 is used to simulate discharge and nutrient loads after calibration with swat cup swat calibration and uncertainty program abbaspour et al 2007 3 concentrations of the major nutrients affecting water quality are simulated with the calibrated model 4 regressions between nutrients concentrations and macroinvertebrate based metrics built from an independent dataset are coupled to swat generated concentrations and 5 the ecological response of streams to current water and wastewater management in the albaida valley is evaluated using simulated chemical and biological indicators fig 1 shows the overall methodology applied in the study 2 1 study area the albaida valley valencia province eastern iberian peninsula is a well defined southwest northeast syncline valley surrounded by the serra grossa and the agullent benicadell mountains reaching up to around 1100 m garcía atiénzar 2007 in the present work a shrubland and agricultural dominated part of the valley with an approximate area of 320 km2 is studied fig 2 the region is characterized by a semi arid mediterranean climate with mean annual temperature between 13 ºc and 17 ºc depending on the specific location mean annual precipitation between 400 mm and 800 mm and mean annual evapotranspiration between 700 mm and 900 mm and the summer drought period is also from june to august siga 2021 the valley consists of the clariano and albaida river watersheds the albaida river that is a tributary of the júcar river originates from benicadell mountain and the clariano river forming in bocairent is its main tributary with a length of 37 km the behavior of the albaida river differs at upstream and downstream of the confluence with the clariano river as it receives important contributions from the clariano river that is severely affected by the effluents of wwtps a few kilometers downstream of their confluence the albaida river flows into the bellús reservoir which is one of the most polluted reservoirs in the valencian community in fact high values of nutrients compounds from point and nonpoint sources have led to water quality degradation and the loss of biodiversity in the rivers and the reservoir

calibration and uncertainty the semi automated sufi 2 algorithm in the swat cup tool is used for calibration and uncertainty analysis as well as sensitivity analysis and validation abbaspour et al 2018 in sufi 2 the propagation of the uncertainty in parameters through applying ranges leads to the model prediction uncertainty which is quantified by the 95 prediction uncertainty the 95ppu in fact the 95ppu is the model output which is calculated from the 2 5 and 97 5 quantiles of cumulative distribution of output variables generated through latin hypercube sampling abbaspour 2015 to quantify the fit between simulation results the 95ppu and observed data values of p factor the percentage of observed data enveloped by the 95ppu and r factor the thickness of the 95ppu envelope quantifying the degree of uncertainty in the model prediction are used abbaspour et al 2007 2015 a p factor value of larger than 0 7 and a r factor value of less than 1 2 would be acceptable for discharge modeling while p factor values of larger than 0 55 0 45 and 0 4 and r factor values of less than 1 8 2 4 and 2 8 are recommended for simulating nitrate suspended solids and phosphorus respectively abbaspour 2020 in the present study the data of montaverner station fig 2 including river discharge and loads of suspended solids nitrate and total phosphorus júcar 2021 are used for model calibration and validation a 7 year period 2005 2011 and a 6 year period 2012 2017 are considered as calibration and validation periods respectively river discharge has been measured continuously while the loads of suspended solids nitrate and total phosphorus have been measured irregularly monthly to trimonthly during these periods although suspended solid is not considered as an indicator of water quality in this study we calibrate it because its calibration will help us in calibrating total phosphorus as phosphorus moves with sediments in the river 500 simulation iterations are applied to calibrate the model table s3 in the supplement provides an overview of swat parameters calibrated in this study 2 5 chemical indicators nitrate ammonium and phosphorus are used in the present study as chemical water quality indicators of the albaida valley time series of concentrations of these nutrients are first generated based on time series of discharge and nutrients loads simulated with the swat model

aspt average score per taxon ept ephemeroptera plecoptera tricoptera and nfam number of families are used in the present study according to national directive of spain royal decree 817 2015 these metrics are calculated from the abundance of macroinvertebrate families measured at six sampling sites s1 s3 s4 s7 s8 and s14 see fig 2 jiménez and pérez 2013 martínez 2013 by using the biomonitor package https github com alexology biomonitor tree main r as macroinvertebrates communities may be influenced by extreme events e g heavy rains the river flow rate in the six months before the samples collection was checked and no extreme events were found that may have affected these measurements in this study pearson s correlation analysis is first used to evaluate possible relationships between observed concentrations of nutrients and obtained macroinvertebrate based metrics table 2 as table 2 shows all macroinvertebrate based metrics are negatively correlated with nutrients concentrations but correlations with nitrate are stronger and more statistically significant thus nitrate is chosen as the best predictor for further analyses in addition ibmwp is selected among macroinvertebrate based metrics although all metrics are strongly correlated with nitrate because bmwp is commonly used as biological quality metric vitecek et al 2021 and recommended reference values of ibmwp are also available for different types of rivers of spain royal decree 817 2015 in the next step the regression equation is obtained from the linear regression analysis between observed concentrations of nitrate and observed values of ibmwp fig 3 because of the low number of sites in the albaida valley data of 117 sampling sites within the catalonia region table s5 aca 2021 are also analyzed to verify the obtained regression equation from the albaida valley database shown in fig 3 these sampling sites have the same ecological characteristics of clariano and albaida rivers i e eco type 9 low mediterranean mountain mineralized rivers moreover anthropic pressures for each sampling site are also specified impress 2020 and cluster analysis legendre and legendre 1998 is then used to determine the sites that are similar to those in the study area i e albaida valley in terms of pressures finally regression equations obtained from the data of selected sampling sites i e 18 sites with the same ecological characteristics and pressures of the albaida valley are compared with the ones resulted from the albaida valley database fig 3 the results from catalonia database support the reliability of the regression equation obtained from the albaida database because nitrate concentrations and ibmwp values are negatively correlated in both regions and the slopes of the equations for the two databases are also comparable differences in intercept values can be explained by different degrees of pressures in each river which indicates that the sensitivity of imbwp values to changes in nitrate concentration is similar for rivers in the catalonia and for the albaida valley rivers the regression equation obtained from the albaida database is hence used for the rest of the analysis this equation is coupled to nitrate concentrations generated with the swat model to produce time series of ibmwp values produced values of ibmwp are finally classified in different quality classes table s6 in the supplement according to national directive of spain royal decree 817 2015 2 7 ecological status in the present study the ecological status of the albaida valley rivers is evaluated by combining chemical and biological indicators based on predicted chemical and biological quality classes streams of the albaida valley are classified into five ecological status classes table s7 in the supplement 3 results and discussion 3 1 swat model performance it is pointed out from fig 4 that the model simulates discharge suspended solids nitrate and total phosphorus satisfactorily following the criteria suggested by abbaspour 2020 the developed model has a very good performance in daily streamflow simulation where p factor values are larger than 0 7 and r factor values are less than 1 2 in both calibration and validation periods p factor values of 0 89 and 0 81 mean that 89 and 81 of observation data fall within the simulation ensemble in calibration and validation periods respectively in addition r factor values of 0 61 and 0 2 indicate that the model uncertainty for discharge is reasonably low the model is found to be reliable also in estimating nitrate suspended solids and total phosphorus despite their limited available measured data as indicated by the r factor fig 4 the uncertainties for nitrate suspended solids and total phosphorus are larger than discharge because they are involved with more model input uncertainties abbaspour et al 2007 2015 overall model prediction uncertainty is reasonable and swat results are comparable with observed values and the residual differences between simulation values and measured data reflect both our incomplete knowledge of all catchment processes affecting water flow and nutrient transport as well as possible errors in the observed data nonetheless our modeling results underline the effectiveness and suitability of the swat model in describing hydrology sediment and nutrients reported in literature abbaspour et al 2007 narsimlu et al 2013 anand et al 2018 chotpantarat and boonkaewwan 2018 consequently the swat results are further used for evaluating the ecological status of streams in the albaida valley 3 2 chemical indicators evaluation observed ranges of nutrients concentrations at the six sampling sites fall within the ranges predicted by the model confirming the good performance of the model except for ammonium concentration at s4 however no values of ammonium concentration were employed during model calibration and higher errors are thus expected for this compound fig 5 as fig 5 indicates the concentrations of chemical indicators vary both in time and space chemical characteristics of water differ in the same location over time possibly due to changes in weather conditions flow regime and pollution loads in the catchment in the clariano river s1 s9 nitrate concentration increases at s3 due to the effluent of the ontinyent wwtp and it then mildly decreases until reaching the albaida river nitrate concentration is lower at upstream sites of the albaida river s10 s12 but it increases at the tributary junction s13 ammonium concentration in the clariano river also increases considerably downstream of ontinyent wwtp s3 and then strongly decreases although it remains above the threshold for a good quality status the albaida river behaves similarly ammonium concentration increases downstream of the albaida wwtp s11 followed by a decrease until s14 where it slightly worsens because of the effluent of the alfarrasi wwtp in the clariano river total phosphorus concentration increases significantly downstream of the ontinyent wwtp and then it is more or less stable total phosphorus in the albaida river also increases downstream of the albaida and alfarrasi wwtps the simulation results agree with the findings of several field studies reporting the increased concentrations downstream of wastewater treatment systems followed by a progressive reduction with increasing downstream distance from the sources of pollution camargo et al 2011 menció and boix 2018 camargo 2019 overall the chemical indicators status of the albaida valley rivers is often classified as bad table 3 except for upstream of streams i e s1 and s2 in the clariano river and s10 in the albaida river in fact chemical indicators status considerably changes downstream of wwtps implying the necessity of wwtps management 3 3 ibmwp evaluation fig 6 shows the values of ibmwp predicted for different sites within the streams of the albaida valley the predicted ranges of ibmwp agree very well with values observed at six sampling sites hence confirming the good performance of the model and the importance of considering probabilistic predictions of biological quality in the clariano river ibmwp decreases considerably at s3 where is affected by ontinyent wwtp ibmwp decreases mildly in the albaida river until the tributary junction s13 where there is an obvious worsening even considering the temporal variability and the model uncertainty ultimately no site exhibits good biological water quality which is classified as either poor or bad in most sites the present results are in line with finding of previous studies on the response of macroinvertebrate community to water quality changes camargo et al 2011 al shami et al 2011 mesgaran karimi et al 2016 menció and boix 2018 however these studies are based on measured field data which are limited to space and time our innovative approach overcomes this limitation and gives the opportunity to predict the biological responses of streams to several water quality stressors on different temporal and spatial dimensions other than the sampled one through generating time series of macroinvertebrate based metrics in particular this approach complements field studies performed in the albaida valley martínez mas et al 2004 jiménez and pérez 2013 martínez 2013 3 4 ecological status evaluation table 4 presents the ecological status of the albaida valley obtained from the model predictions these results are in agreement with the ecological classification of the clariano and albaida rivers as poor by martínez mas et al 2004 and by martínez 2013 the present study gives an emphasis to the evident need for mitigation and rehabilitation measures in the albaida valley suggesting that measures such as surface runoff reduction improvements in wwtps modifications of wastewater releases wetland restoration regulation of flows specially to avoid long period of low flow and management of agriculture could markedly improve environmental conditions of rivers nilsson and malm renöfält 2008 camargo 2019 it is worth noting that the establishment of realistic thresholds of nutrients is an important component of any nutrient management policy while some eu member states now employ excessively high nutrient thresholds poikane et al 2021 the approaches suggested for the identification of thresholds for nutrients to support ecological status phillips et al 2018 kelly et al 2022 could not be applied in this study because of the limited number of sites and samples programming sampling campaigns aimed at this purpose would advance our understanding of nutrient impact on river ecosystems 4 conclusions river ecosystems are extremely impacted by human induced environmental degradation watershed models are beneficial for guiding and evaluating management strategies in such rivers as they are capable of simulating nearly all processes taking place in watersheds in an efficient way the present study intended to model nitrate ammonium phosphorus and macroinvertebrates as aquatic ecosystem health indicators of the albaida valley this represents an innovative ecohydrological modeling approach that enables us to evaluate temporal and spatial patterns of the ecological status of rivers in the valley based on simulated chemical and biological indicators the ecological status of the valley is mostly classified as poor due to point and nonpoint sources of nutrients this study recognizes the need for mitigation and rehabilitation measures in the valley particularly for the management of wwtps and agriculture it is concluded that the approach proposed in this study could be used as a complementary technique to river sampling in assessing ecological conditions of rivers moreover the provided approach could be further used to investigate possible impacts of changes in climate land use and local management policies on availability and

freshwater ecosystems is undermining their ability to provide benefits to humans and other species naiman and turner 2000 carpenter et al 2011 excessive water withdrawal urbanization agriculture deforestation and global warming are important stressors that severely damage freshwater environments jackson et al 2001 carone et al 2009 luo et al 2018 wilkinson et al 2018 pham et al 2019 lin et al 2021 however nutrient pollution is indeed a major contributor to river degradation eea 2018 carvalho et al 2019 while agricultural and urban land uses are associated to important diffuse sources of nutrients effluents of wwtps can also significantly contribute to nutrient loads in downstream reaches despite the extensive treatment of wastewater prior to discharge in receiving waters the impact of effluents from wwtps could be even more prominent during dry periods in semi arid and arid areas since most of the flow in the river channel is mainly composed of wwtp effluent dennehy et al 1998 passell et al 2005 carey and migliaccio 2009 maier et al 2009 lópez doval et al 2013 ladapo and aminu 2017 preisner et al 2020 recognizing the importance of freshwater conservation several programs and agreements such as the european water framework directive the u s clean water act the minamata convention the international commission for the protection of the rhine and the chinese grain for green program have been developed to protect river biodiversity and ecosystem functioning however more efforts are still required to implement such policies as many water bodies have not reached the acceptable water quality standards yet in europe for instance around 60 of surface water bodies failed to achieve the good ecological status in 2018 and it is predicted that achieving the desired objectives of the wfd by 2027 would be a challenge in many countries european commission 2019 dedić et al 2020 watershed modeling can assist scientists and policymakers to determine and develop

climate and land use in another study schmalz et al 2015 suggested that the species richness would be affected by deforestation in the changjiang river watershed china the results of a study conducted in turkey indicate that the richness and composition of macroinvertebrates in the kucuk menderes river vary as the river becomes polluted by flowing through residential industrial and agricultural areas arslan et al 2016 mesgaran karimi et al 2016 also showed that the effluents of two trout farms have significantly decreased the diversity of macroinvertebrates in the dohezar stream iran river ecological assessment has progressed significantly in the last few decades poikane et al 2021 in europe the water framework directive wfd 2000 60 ec is the main legislation for achieving good ecological status and the relationships between nutrients biological structure and ecological status in rivers are explored based on the concept behind the wfd kelly et al 2009 poikane et al 2020 most of the studies conducted on river biodiversity e g al shami et al 2011 arslan et al 2016 mesgaran karimi et al 2016 menció and boix 2018 are based on datasets resulting from river sampling campaigns in addition to the knowledge derived from these experimental studies watershed scale models have the capability to complement these studies by investigating the response of freshwater ecosystem to different environmental stressors at various places and times other than the sampled ones and also to strengthen our understanding by predicting the ecosystem response to different stressor scenarios thus the main objective of the present study is to evaluate the potential of an integrated modeling approach in predicting the water quality and the ecological response to different hydrological management scenarios in particular in the current work the swat soil and water assessment tool software is used to build an ecohydrological model of an agricultural catchment in spain and the evaluation of ecological conditions of stream network are evaluated by coupling outputs of the swat model and regressions between nutrients concentrations and macroinvertebrate based metrics the chosen approach allows to quantify model uncertainty which has been discussed as a crucial step for watershed modeling abbaspour et al 2015 2 materials and methods an ecohydrological modeling approach is developed in the present study to evaluate ecological status of the albaida valley streams for this purpose 1 a variety of information is collected to characterize the case study 2 the swat model arnold et al 1998 is used to simulate discharge and nutrient loads after calibration with swat cup swat calibration and uncertainty program abbaspour et al 2007 3 concentrations of the major nutrients affecting water quality are simulated with the calibrated model 4 regressions between nutrients concentrations and macroinvertebrate based metrics built from an independent dataset are coupled to swat generated concentrations and 5 the ecological response of streams to current water and wastewater management in the albaida valley is evaluated using simulated chemical and biological indicators fig 1 shows the overall methodology applied in the study 2 1 study area the albaida valley valencia province eastern iberian peninsula is a well defined southwest northeast syncline valley surrounded by the serra grossa and the agullent benicadell mountains reaching up to around 1100 m garcía atiénzar 2007 in the present work a shrubland and agricultural dominated part of the valley with an approximate area of 320 km2 is studied fig 2 the region is characterized by a semi arid mediterranean climate with mean annual temperature between 13 ºc and 17 ºc depending on the specific location mean annual precipitation between 400 mm and 800 mm and mean annual evapotranspiration between 700 mm and 900 mm and the summer drought period is also from june to august siga 2021 the valley consists of the clariano and albaida river watersheds the albaida river that is a tributary of the júcar river originates from benicadell mountain and the clariano river forming in bocairent is its main tributary with a length of 37 km the behavior of the albaida river differs at upstream and downstream of the confluence with the clariano river as it receives important contributions from the clariano river that is severely affected by the effluents of wwtps a few kilometers downstream of their confluence the albaida river flows into the bellús reservoir which is one of the most polluted reservoirs in the valencian community in fact high values of nutrients compounds from point and nonpoint sources have led to water quality degradation and the loss of biodiversity in the rivers and the reservoir

the first three years 2002 2004 are used for warming up the model and are excluded from analyses the rest of simulations 2005 2017 are used for model calibration and validation 2 4 the swat model calibration and uncertainty the semi automated sufi 2 algorithm in the swat cup tool is used for calibration and uncertainty analysis as well as sensitivity analysis and validation abbaspour et al 2018 in sufi 2 the propagation of the uncertainty in parameters through applying ranges leads to the model prediction uncertainty which is quantified by the 95 prediction uncertainty the 95ppu in fact the 95ppu is the model output which is calculated from the 2 5 and 97 5 quantiles of cumulative distribution of output variables generated through latin hypercube sampling abbaspour 2015 to quantify the fit between simulation results the 95ppu and observed data values of p factor the percentage of observed data enveloped by the 95ppu and r factor the thickness of the 95ppu envelope quantifying the degree of uncertainty in the model prediction are used abbaspour et al 2007 2015 a p factor value of larger than 0 7 and a r factor value of less than 1 2 would be acceptable for discharge modeling while p factor values of larger than 0 55 0 45 and 0 4 and r factor values of less than 1 8 2 4 and 2 8 are recommended for simulating nitrate suspended solids and phosphorus respectively abbaspour 2020 in the present study the data of montaverner station fig 2 including river discharge and loads of suspended solids nitrate and total phosphorus júcar 2021 are used for model calibration and validation a 7 year period 2005 2011 and a 6 year period 2012 2017 are considered as calibration and validation periods respectively river discharge has been measured continuously while the loads of suspended solids nitrate and total phosphorus have been measured irregularly monthly to trimonthly during these periods although suspended solid is not considered as an indicator of water quality in this study we calibrate it because its calibration will help us in calibrating total phosphorus as phosphorus moves with sediments in the river 500 simulation iterations are applied to calibrate the model table s3 in the supplement provides an overview of swat parameters calibrated in this study 2 5 chemical indicators nitrate ammonium and phosphorus are used in the present study as chemical water quality indicators of the albaida valley time series of concentrations of these nutrients are first generated based on time series of discharge and nutrients loads simulated with the swat model afterwards generated concentrations are classified in different quality classes table s4 in the supplement according to national directive of spain royal decree 817 2015 2 6 biological indicators this work focuses on macroinvertebrates as biological indicators of stream health macroinvertebrates represent the most important biological indicators in freshwater biomonitoring due to their different sensitivity to changes in both water chemistry and habitat bo et al 2017 macroinvertebrate based metrics are widely used to detect clean or polluted water as they can provide useful information of local conditions camargo et al 2004 clews and ormerod 2009 gombeer et al 2011 nicacio and juen 2015 several macroinvertebrate based metrics including ibmwp iberian biological monitoring working party aspt average score per taxon ept ephemeroptera plecoptera tricoptera and nfam number of families are used in the present study according to national directive of spain royal decree 817 2015 these metrics are calculated from the abundance of macroinvertebrate families measured at six sampling sites s1 s3 s4 s7 s8 and s14 see fig 2 jiménez and pérez 2013 martínez 2013 by using the biomonitor package https github com alexology biomonitor tree main r as macroinvertebrates communities may be influenced by extreme events e g heavy rains the river flow rate in the six months before the samples collection was checked and no extreme events were found that may have affected these measurements in this study pearson s correlation analysis is first used to evaluate possible relationships between observed concentrations of nutrients and obtained macroinvertebrate based metrics table 2 as table 2 shows all macroinvertebrate based metrics are negatively correlated with nutrients concentrations but correlations with nitrate are stronger and more statistically significant thus nitrate is chosen as the best predictor for further analyses in addition ibmwp is selected among macroinvertebrate based metrics although all metrics are strongly correlated with nitrate because bmwp is commonly used as biological quality metric vitecek et al 2021 and recommended reference values of ibmwp are also available for different types of rivers of spain royal decree 817 2015 in the next step the regression equation is obtained from the linear regression analysis between observed concentrations of nitrate and observed values of ibmwp fig 3 because of the low number of sites in the albaida valley data of 117 sampling sites within the catalonia region table s5 aca 2021 are also analyzed to verify the obtained regression equation from the albaida valley database shown in fig 3 these sampling sites have the same ecological characteristics of clariano and albaida rivers i e eco type 9 low mediterranean mountain mineralized rivers moreover anthropic pressures for each sampling site are also specified impress 2020 and cluster analysis legendre and legendre 1998 is then used to determine the sites that are similar to those in the study area i e albaida valley in terms of pressures finally regression equations obtained from the data of selected sampling sites i e 18 sites with the same ecological characteristics and pressures of the albaida valley are compared with the ones resulted from the albaida valley database fig 3 the results from catalonia database support the reliability of the regression equation obtained from the albaida database because nitrate concentrations and ibmwp values are negatively correlated in both regions and the slopes of the equations for the two databases are also comparable differences in intercept values can be explained by different degrees of pressures in each river which indicates that the sensitivity of imbwp values to changes in nitrate concentration is similar for rivers in the catalonia and for the albaida valley rivers the regression equation obtained from the albaida database is hence used for the rest of the analysis this equation is coupled to nitrate concentrations generated with the swat model to produce time series of ibmwp values produced values of ibmwp are finally classified in different quality classes table s6 in the supplement according to national directive of spain royal decree 817 2015 2 7 ecological status in the present study the ecological status of the albaida valley rivers is evaluated by combining chemical and biological indicators based on predicted chemical and biological quality classes streams of the albaida valley are classified into five ecological status classes table s7 in the supplement 3 results and discussion 3 1 swat model performance it is pointed out from fig 4 that the model simulates discharge suspended solids nitrate and total phosphorus satisfactorily following the criteria suggested by abbaspour 2020 the developed model has a very good performance in daily streamflow simulation where p factor values are larger than 0 7 and r factor values are less than 1 2 in both calibration and validation periods p factor values of 0 89 and 0 81 mean that 89 and 81 of observation data fall within the simulation ensemble in calibration and validation periods respectively in addition r factor values of 0 61 and 0 2 indicate that the model uncertainty for discharge is reasonably low the model is found to be reliable also in estimating nitrate suspended solids and total phosphorus despite their limited available measured data as indicated by the r factor fig 4 the uncertainties for nitrate suspended solids and total phosphorus are larger than discharge because they are involved with more model input uncertainties abbaspour et al 2007 2015 overall model prediction uncertainty is reasonable and swat results are comparable with observed values and the residual differences between simulation values and measured data reflect both our incomplete knowledge of all catchment processes affecting water flow and nutrient transport as well as possible errors in the observed data nonetheless our modeling results underline the effectiveness and suitability of the swat model in describing hydrology sediment and nutrients reported in literature abbaspour et al 2007 narsimlu et al 2013 anand et al 2018 chotpantarat and boonkaewwan 2018 consequently the swat results are further used for evaluating the ecological status of streams in the albaida valley 3 2 chemical indicators evaluation observed ranges of nutrients concentrations at the six sampling sites fall within the ranges predicted by the model confirming the good performance of the model except for ammonium concentration at s4 however no values of ammonium concentration were employed during model calibration and higher errors are thus expected for this compound fig 5 as fig 5 indicates the concentrations of chemical indicators vary both in time and space chemical characteristics of water differ in the same location over time possibly due to changes in weather conditions flow regime and pollution loads in the catchment in the clariano river s1 s9 nitrate concentration increases at s3 due to the effluent of the ontinyent wwtp and it then mildly decreases until reaching the albaida river nitrate concentration is lower at upstream sites of the albaida river s10 s12 but it increases at the tributary junction s13 ammonium concentration in the clariano river also increases considerably downstream of ontinyent wwtp s3 and then strongly decreases although it remains above the threshold for a good quality status the albaida river behaves similarly ammonium concentration increases downstream of the albaida wwtp s11 followed by a decrease until s14 where it slightly worsens because of the effluent of the alfarrasi wwtp in the clariano river total phosphorus concentration increases significantly downstream of the ontinyent wwtp and then it is more or less stable total phosphorus in the albaida river also increases downstream of the albaida and alfarrasi wwtps the simulation results agree with the findings of several field studies reporting the increased concentrations downstream of wastewater treatment systems followed by a progressive reduction with increasing downstream distance from the sources of pollution camargo et al 2011 menció and boix 2018 camargo 2019 overall the chemical indicators status of the albaida valley rivers is often classified as bad table 3 except for upstream of streams i e s1 and s2 in the clariano river and s10 in the albaida river in fact chemical indicators status considerably changes downstream of wwtps implying the necessity of wwtps management 3 3 ibmwp evaluation fig 6 shows the values of ibmwp predicted for different sites within the streams of the albaida valley the predicted ranges of ibmwp agree very well with values observed at six sampling sites hence confirming the good performance of the model and the importance of considering probabilistic predictions of biological quality in the clariano river ibmwp decreases considerably at s3 where is affected by ontinyent wwtp ibmwp decreases mildly in the albaida river until the tributary junction s13 where there is an obvious worsening even considering the temporal variability and the model uncertainty ultimately no site exhibits good biological water quality which is classified as either poor or bad in most sites the present results are in line with finding of previous studies on the response of macroinvertebrate community to water quality changes camargo et al 2011 al shami et al 2011 mesgaran karimi et al 2016 menció and boix 2018 however these studies are based on measured field data which are limited to space and time our innovative approach overcomes this limitation and gives the opportunity to predict the biological responses of streams to several water quality stressors on different temporal and spatial dimensions other than the sampled one through generating time series of macroinvertebrate based metrics in particular this approach complements field studies performed in the albaida valley martínez mas et al 2004 jiménez and pérez 2013 martínez 2013 3 4 ecological status evaluation table 4 presents the ecological status of the albaida valley obtained from the model predictions these results are in agreement with the ecological classification of the clariano and albaida rivers as poor by martínez mas et al 2004 and by martínez 2013 the present study gives an emphasis to the evident need for mitigation and rehabilitation measures in the albaida valley suggesting that measures such as surface runoff reduction improvements in wwtps modifications of wastewater releases wetland restoration regulation of flows specially to avoid long period of low flow and management of agriculture could markedly improve environmental conditions of rivers nilsson and malm renöfält 2008 camargo 2019 it is worth noting that the establishment of realistic thresholds of nutrients is an important component of any nutrient management policy while some eu member states now employ excessively high nutrient thresholds poikane et al 2021 the approaches suggested for the identification of thresholds for nutrients to support ecological status phillips et al 2018 kelly et al 2022 could not be applied in this study because of the limited number of sites and samples programming sampling campaigns aimed at this purpose would advance our understanding of nutrient impact on river ecosystems 4 conclusions river ecosystems are extremely impacted by human induced environmental degradation watershed models are beneficial for guiding and evaluating management strategies in such rivers as they are capable of simulating nearly all processes taking place in watersheds in an efficient way the present study intended to model nitrate ammonium phosphorus and macroinvertebrates as aquatic ecosystem health indicators of the albaida valley this represents an innovative ecohydrological modeling approach that enables us to evaluate temporal and spatial patterns of the ecological status of rivers in the valley based on simulated chemical and biological indicators the ecological status of the valley is mostly classified as poor due to point and nonpoint sources of nutrients this study recognizes the need for mitigation and rehabilitation measures in the valley particularly for the management of wwtps and agriculture it is concluded that the approach proposed in this study could be used as a complementary technique to river sampling in assessing ecological conditions of rivers moreover the provided approach could be further used to investigate possible impacts of changes in climate land use and local management policies on availability and

7918,study region arid and semi arid regions of northwest china study focus precipitable water vapor pw is the medium for energy and water exchange and supplies moisture for precipitation based on meteorological data and pw data from observation and six reanalysis products the climate shift in the arid and semi arid regions of northwest china asrnc during 1980 2018 have been explored by applying the reference pw scaling and conversion efficiency of precipitation new hydrological insights for the region the pw of reanalysis data sets was overestimated in spring while was underestimated in summer autumn and winter however the spatial distribution of simulated pw was more consistent with the topography of the asrnc from 1980 2018 in the context of overall regional warming the pw was more likely to present significant increasing trends over the regions with high and increasing pw scaling in general the pw increased from 1980 to 2000 the fluctuating upward trend intensified thereafter meanwhile the increasing rates of simulated pw were remarkably underestimated during 2000 2018 the precipitation in the asrnc was greatly influenced by the precipitation conversion efficiency especially in spring and autumn generally the wet tendency was identified in the western and central regions because of the increase in pw and precipitation conversion efficiency from 1980 to 2018 graphical abstract ga1 keywords arid and semi arid regions of china precipitable water vapor pw scaling precipitation conversion efficiency climatic shift 1 introduction in recent years greenhouse gas emissions have caused a dramatic and sustained increase in mean surface temperatures especially in china wu et al 2020 the anthropogenic global warming progresses would increase the frequency of droughts and expand the area of extremely dry land dai et al 2004 hou et al 2020 water vapor is the single most plentiful greenhouse gas in the atmosphere held and soden 2000 dai et al 2011 zhang and zhao 2018 water vapor increases in a warmer world will amplify the climatic influences on the other greenhouse gases held and soden 2000 therefore as climate warming because of the increase in co2 and other greenhouse gases atmospheric water vapor is expected to increase this highly enhances the warming in turn zhao et al 2012 several papers have discovered an increasing trend in precipitable water vapor pw over many places around the globe zhao et al 2012 disclosed that the pw increased in most regions of china from 1970 to 2008 especially in north china under the framework of phase 5 of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 numerous papers zhang and zhao 2018 zhang et al 2019a 2019b discovered that the pw of china has increased since 1970 due to the anthropogenic forcing based on the papers about atmospheric water resources liu et al 2018 found that the pw over the arid and semi arid areas of east asia has presented sharply upward trends since the mid 1980s especially in summer wang et al 2016 revealed that the pw had a global increasing trend during 1995 2011 by using the newly homogenized radiosonde data global positioning system pw data and microwave satellite dataset pw is the medium for earth s energy and water exchange and transport and could provide water resources for the formation of precipitation dai et al 2011 wang et al 2016 generally pw was one of the major influencing factors driving the trend of humidification zhang et al 2017 and was positively correlated with precipitation zhao et al 2010 therefore the increase in pw as global warming might ease the water shortage in china the arid and semi arid regions of northwest china asrnc which are situated deeply inland with scarce precipitation and intensive evapotranspiration chang et al 2018 suffer from the increasingly serious mismatch between water resources and the spatial distribution of productivity chen et al 2015 overall the internal water cycle of the asrnc is quite inactive cheng and wang 2006 cold and drought are common impressions there however due to the weakening of the siberian high and the rising of the greenhouse emission the temperature over northwest china had a great increasing trend which is higher than that in china li et al 2012 a warming climate could accelerate the water cycle there douville et al 2002 chen et al 2015 2016 gu et al 2015 ma 2007 discovered a persistent process of climate change in the central part of north china during 1951 2005 gu et al 2015 disclosed that temperature precipitation and the frequency of floods increased persistently after the mid 1980s shi et al 2002 pointed out that a series of signals from the warm dry climate to the warm humid climate have been found in xinjiang since 1987 yang et al 2021 found that eastern northwest china has experienced a dry to wet climate transition since the late 1990s due to the synergistic enhancement of the east asian summer monsoon and westerly circulation zhang et al 2022 also disclosed that a humidification trend was found in northwest china at the beginning of the 21st century the increase in pw was one of the possible reasons for the climate shift over northwest china shi et al 2003 a fluctuating upward trend of pw was found in the asrnc with the intensification of global warming liu and zhang 2011 liu et al 2018 however the influences of temperature rise on the hydrological cycle of meltwater water based regions in northwest china are complicated guo and wang 2014 therefore the variation of pw in the asrnc is controversial yao et al 2018 disclosed that the pw and precipitation of the arid region of northwest china increased dramatically in the late 1980s but decreased obviously after 2000 chen et al 2019 revealed that the pw over the arid region of northwest china experienced a significant increase trend during 1970 2002 while the obvious increase was replaced by a slight decrease from 2003 to 2013 in any case the increase in temperature brought new opportunities to the asrnc the understanding of the climatic shift as well as its evolution mechanisms in the arid and semi arid regions of china has been limited so far although numerous papers have explored the changes of pw in the arid regions of northwest china only a few papers comprehensively investigate the climate shift based on pw temperature and precipitation fewer studies researched the relationship between the pw changes and temperature precipitation variations in the asrnc overall the warming and wetting trend in the 21st century is still inexplicit thus the main aims of this paper were 1 to explore the latest variation of pw in the arid and semi arid regions of china 2 to probe whether the pw change could indicate further warming and humidification of climate the results of this paper could help understand the climate transformation in the arid and semi arid regions of central asia 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area and data the asrnc are located in the north of the great wall and kunlun mountains including the whole of xinjiang inner mongolia northern ningxia western gansu and the qaidam basin in qinghai and covering around one third of china s territory qu 1986 hua et al 2016 to preserve the integrity of the region xinjiang gansu inner mongolia ningxia and qinghai were selected as the study area chang et al 2018 fig 1 this region is affected by the interactions among the summer monsoon the westerlies and the plateau monsoon zhang et al 2019a 2019b and is controlled by arid and semi arid climates the main terrains there are plateaus basins and mountains including the tibetan plateau the inner mongolia plateau the tarim river basin the qaidam basin and the qilian mountains wei et al 2014 zhang et al 2019a 2019b the mountains such as tianshan mountains would block the routine of pw zhang et al 2012a 2012b therefore the spatio temporal climate variations in the asrnc are complex in this paper the homogenized twice daily radiosonde humidity records over the asrnc were updated to 2018 applying the homogenized approach developed by dai et al 2011 to ensure the reliability the homogenized sounding data from 31 radiosonde stations of this region with more than 85 valid records during 1980 2018 were selected in this paper fig 1 these homogenized humidity records performed well in exhibiting spatially coherent long term trends zhang and zhao 2018 the observed pw was calculated by integrating the specific humidity from radiosonde observations from the surface to 300 hpa and reflected the total water vapor content for the entire tropospheric column zhao et al 2015 zhang and zhao 2018 to facilitate the comparisons and research the monthly mean from the stations was regridded onto a common 1 1 grid using the cressman interpolation technique cressman 1959 the observed precipitation and temperature data used in this paper were the monthly gridded precipitation and temperature products from the national meteorological science data center during 1980 2018 with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 http data cma cn the monthly simulated pw data were obtained from six reanalysis products directly thereinto the era interim reanalysis has been upgraded to the era5 reanalysis except for the jra 55 and merra2 the other four reanalysis data sets used in this paper were all available from 1979 when the satellite was put into use zhao and zhou 2020 the details of the six reanalysis data sets were provided in table 1 for consistency the time period of all data used in this paper was all from 1980 to 2018 2 2 methodology the centered root mean square difference rmsd and correlation coefficient cc were used in this paper to quantitatively evaluate the skill of reanalysis products over the asrnc to compute spatial rmsd and cc the data of all gridded pw data sets were interpolated to precipitation and temperature fine resolution by using the inverse distance weighted idw method then the spatial correlation and rmsd were computed at the 0 5 grid scale as for the assessment of reanalysis data in representing the temporal variation of pw raw gridded data were used the centered rmsd is defined by cheng 2016 1 rmsd 1 n n 1 n x n x x obsn x obs 2 where x obs and x are the mean values of gridded observation and reanalysis data sets respectively the cc between gridded observation and reanalysis data sets is defined as 2 cc 1 n n 1 n x n x x obsn x obs σ re σ obs where σ re and σ obs are the standard deviations of reanalysis data and gridded observation the pw scaling and conversion efficiency of precipitation were used in this paper to explore the relationship between pw and temperature and the connection between pw and precipitation the reference pw scaling at each grid was obtained by applying the percentage variations of 0 5 regridded pw scaled by raw atmosphere temperature changes at the corresponding grid liang and zhang 2021 the variations were calculated as the differences between the periods of 1980 2018 and 1980 1999 the conversion efficiency of precipitation was calculated by using total annual precipitation divided by the corresponding 0 5 regridded annual pw from 1980 to 2018 zhao et al 2010 3 results 3 1 pw is still increasing in the 21st century over the asrnc in this paper the grid values of six reanalysis data sets have been interpolated to various stations using the idw method to evaluate the performance of simulated pw fig 2 compared with the pw of point observation all reanalysis overestimated the pw in northern gansu eastern xinjiang and the north of western inner mongolia to facilitate further research the regridded observation was adopted in this paper therefore the simulated pw data sets at the grid scale were also evaluated based on gridded observed pw fig s1 in supplementary material it could be seen that except for qinghai all reanalysis data products underestimated the pw in the regions with high altitudes however the spatial distribution of simulated pw was more consistent with the terrain and topography characteristics in the asrnc because the radiosonde stations there were scarce fig 1 and fig s1 in supplementary material based on the gridded observation the centered rmsd of era interim 1 61 mm and jra 55 1 55 mm were lower and the spatial correlation of the two reanalysis sets ccera interim 0 7780 ccjra 55 0 7550 were higher therefore in terms of spatial simulation era interim and jra 55 performed the best over the asrnc meanwhile the cfsr performed the worst in representing the spatial pattern of pw due to the highest centered rmsd 2 23 mm and the lowest spatial cc 0 6505 it was worth noting that the upgraded era products did not show an advantage in the asrnc compared with the era interim the era5 had higher centered rmsd 2 13 mm and lower cc 0 6799 in general over the study region the observation decreased from northwest and southeast 12 mm to the center 6 mm while the simulated pw decreased from east and northwest 12 mm to southwest 6 mm changing trends of pw in the asrnc during 1980 2018 at the point and grid scales were analyzed as well overall the variation of point pw was highly consistent with that of the gridded pw however the decreasing trends of gridded observation were more significant in xinjiang qinghai northern gansu and inner mongolia fig 3a and fig s2a in supplementary material generally the observed pw increased significantly over the asrnc except for parts of xinjiang southern qinghai gansu and eastern inner mongolia as for the cfsr era interim and ear5 the prominent increasing trends in pw during 1980 2018 were concentrated in the south fig 3b d e and fig s2b d e in supplementary material the pw of cra jra 55 and merra2 even presented significantly upward trends throughout almost the entire study region fig 3c f g and fig s2c f g in supplementary material in general except for parts of xinjiang and eastern inner mongolia the pw increased from 1980 to 2018 in the asrnc over the asrnc the warming and wetting trends were still inexplicit in the 21st century therefore the inter annual progression of seasonal annual mean pw and inter decadal variations of pw derived from two observations and six reanalysis data sets were analyzed as was shown in fig 4 and fig s3 in supplementary material the seasonal and annual mean pw fluctuations of point and gridded observations along with the ranges of various decadal changes between the two sets of observations were quite similar however from 1980 to 2000 the gridded pw in summer and autumn were mildly lower than the pw of stations resulting in a slightly lower annual gridded pw fig 4b c e generally the pw in the asrnc was concentrated in summer the pw in autumn was slightly higher than that in spring while the pw in winter was the lowest all reanalysis products caught the changing trends of observed pw well during 1980 2018 over the asrnc however the reanalysis data products overestimated the pw in spring especially for cfsr during 1980 1989 and 2006 2011 fig 4a in summer autumn and winter the pw from all reanalysis data products was underestimated especially for cra and jra 55 fig 4b d generally cra and jra 55 distinctly underestimated the pw while cfsr slightly overestimated the pw in the 1980s during 1997 2005 all the modeled annual pw performed relatively well due to the good performance in summer all six reanalysis sets sharply underestimated the pw after 2011 in all seasons therefore the increasing rates of pw simulated by reanalysis data sets were greatly underestimated in the 21st century over the asrnc in fact the annual observed pw increased gradually before 2000 slope 0 0325 the upward trend intensified thereafter slope 0 0672 fig 4e the same phenomenon was found in spring summer and autumn fig 4a c in winter the observed pw increased gradually before 2000 slope 0 0180 while the changing trend turned into reduction trends during 2000 2018 slope 0 0227 fig 4d in general the pw of two observed data sets cra jra 55 and merra2 exhibited a continually inter decadal increase from 1980 to 2018 while the continually pw increasing trend was not distinct in cfsr era interim and era5 fig s3 in supplementary material the temporal correlation and rmsd of six reanalysis products based on gridded observation were presented in table 2 it could be seen that the temporal cc values of reanalysis data products were all more than 0 5651 in the asrnc thereinto cra owned the lowest centered rmsd 0 25 mm and the highest similarity with gridded observation 0 8778 hence cra performed the best among six reanalysis data sets over the asrnc on the contrary era5 had the highest centered rmsd 0 44 mm and the lowest temporal correlation 0 5651 therefore era5 performed the worst in representing the temporal variation of pw over the study region it also meant that the upgraded era products did not show an advantage in representing the temporal changes as well 3 2 the response of pw to continual warming over the asrnc a mechanistic understanding of pw changes is necessary thus the spatial distribution and changing trends of annual mean temperature over the asrnc were analyzed in fig 5a b to explore the response of pw to temperature in the asrnc the atmosphere temperature was negatively correlated with the altitude fig 5a the lowest temperature 4 occurred in the tibetan plateau on the southwest edge of the study region while the temperature in the tarim river basin was the highest 10 combined with the spatial distribution of simulated pw fig s1b g in supplementary material it could be found that the region with higher temperature had higher pw as was presented in fig 5b except for parts of xinjiang and northern inner mongolia presenting slight warming trends the atmosphere temperature increased significantly over entire asrnc from 1980 to 2018 the scaling of pw change with temperature was investigated to further explore the response of pw to continual warming in the asrnc as was shown in fig s2 in supplementary material and fig 6 in the context of regional warming the changing trends of pw were quite similar to the spatial distribution of pw scaling generally in the regions where the response of pw to warming was scaled to be below 3 k the pw usually presented a reduction trend the pw was relatively stable in the areas where the pw scaling ranged from 3 k to 0 k in the regions where the pw scaling was greater than 5 k the pw tended to increase significantly from 1980 to 2018 the changing trends of scaling of pw with temperature in the asrnc from 1980 to 2018 were investigated in fig 7 it could be seen that except for parts of xinjiang eastern inner mongolia and southern regions the response of pw to warming increased in most areas of the study region based on observation cfsr cra jra 55 and merra2 fig 7a c f g as for era interim and era5 the increase of pw scaling was concentrated in the center of the asrnc fig 7d e overall except for era interim and era5 the pw was more likely to present significant increasing trends in the areas with pw scaling increasing from 1980 to 2018 fig s2a c f g in supplementary material and fig 7a c f g 3 3 will more pw bring more precipitation over the asrnc this paper further explored whether the increase of pw would bring more precipitation over the asrnc fig s4 in supplementary material illustrated that precipitation was positively correlated with pw in most regions of the asrnc on the contrary in a few areas of xinjiang eastern inner mongolia and southern region the precipitation was negatively correlated with pw however sufficient pw is only one of the conditions for the formation of precipitation more pw did not always bring more precipitation therefore in some regions the correlations of the pw and precipitation were not significant generally the highest precipitation 600 mm occurred in the south of the study region while the lowest precipitation 100 mm was concentrated in the tarim river basin with high pw and temperature fig s1 in supplementary material and fig 5a c except for parts of xinjiang eastern inner mongolia and the southeastern edge the precipitation increased in almost entire arid and semi arid regions fig 5d areas with increasing pw were more likely to present an increasing trend in precipitation fig s2 in supplementary material and fig 5d therefore in the asrnc high pw did not mean high precipitation but there was a certain consistency between the changes of pw and precipitation the conversion efficiency of annual mean precipitation was applied to further investigate the relationship between precipitation and pw in the asrnc as was presented in fig 8 the spatial patterns of simulated conversion efficiency were highly similar to those of observed ones the highest precipitation conversion efficiency 20 was concentrated in the regions with high altitudes 4500 m while the lowest conversion efficiency of precipitation 2 occurred in the tarim river basin overall the distribution of conversion efficiency was generally consistent with that of precipitation figs 5c and 8 therefore it could be considered that the amount of precipitation depended on the conversion efficiency of precipitation over the asrnc in the tarim river basin the pw was high while the precipitation conversion efficiency was low so the precipitation there was quite low in the east of inner mongolia the precipitation was relatively high due to the high pw and conversion efficiency as for the south of northwest china the reasons for the high precipitation in southern qinghai and southern gansu were different in the south of qinghai although the pw was low the conversion efficiency was very high so the precipitation there was still high in contrast extremely high pw and low precipitation conversion efficiency together brought comparatively high precipitation in the south of gansu as was shown in fig 9 the changing trends of precipitation conversion efficiency from observation and six reanalysis data sets were generally the same over the asrnc during 1980 2018 overall the changing trend of conversion efficiency of annual mean precipitation was consistent with that of precipitation figs 5d and 9 the reduction of conversion efficiency was concentrated in xinjiang eastern inner mongolia and the southern part meanwhile the increase in precipitation conversion efficiency was mainly located in the western and central regions it could be seen that in the regions with conversion efficiency decreasing and no changing trends the correlations between pw and precipitation were more likely to be insignificant fig s4 in supplementary material and fig 9 generally the decrease in pw and precipitation conversion efficiency resulted in a decrease in precipitation in some regions of xinjiang and eastern inner mongolia fig s2 in supplementary material fig 5d and fig 9 in the south of the study region although the pw increased significantly the precipitation remained constant due to the reduction of conversion efficiency from 1980 to 2018 over most regions of western and central areas the precipitation increased with the increase of pw and precipitation conversion efficiency overall whether the increment of pw would bring more precipitation was largely determined by the conversion efficiency of annual mean precipitation the inter annual progressions of seasonal and annual mean precipitation and precipitation conversion efficiency were analyzed as well fig 10 in general the precipitation in spring and autumn decreased from 1980 to 2000 and presented upward trends thereafter oppositely in winter the precipitation increased before 2000 while decreased after 2000 in summer the precipitation increased during 1980 2000 slope 0 2576 then the upward trend intensified dramatically during 2000 2018 slope 1 7514 in the asrnc the precipitation was concentrated in summer while the precipitation in winter was negligible therefore the annual precipitation there presented an increasing trend during 1980 2000 slope 0 1779 the upward trend greatly intensified after that slope 3 1090 all reanalysis data sets could reproduce the seasonal and annual precipitation conversion efficiency fluctuations of observation well however compared with the precipitation conversion efficiency of gridded observation the six reanalysis products slightly underestimated the precipitation conversion efficiency in spring fig 10a in contrast the simulated conversion efficiency of precipitation was overestimated in autumn and winter fig 10c d therefore generally the annual precipitation conversion efficiency was mildly overestimated fig 10e it could be seen that the seasonal and annual fluctuations of precipitation conversion efficiency were quite similar to that of precipitation as was shown in fig 10a c in spring summer and autumn the conversion efficiency of precipitation decreased before 2000 while presenting upward trends thereafter in winter the precipitation conversion efficiency increased gradually before 2000 slope 0 0211 then the increasing trend greatly intensified slope 0 0760 the changing trends of annual precipitation conversion efficiency were consistent with those of spring summer and autumn in general over the asrnc the fluctuations of precipitation were affected by pw and precipitation conversion efficiency together figs 4 and 10 in spring and autumn the pw continually increased and the changes in precipitation were mainly affected by the precipitation conversion efficiency as for summer and winter the changes in precipitation varied with the changes in pw 4 discussions because of the unique location and inactive internal water cycle cheng and wang 2006 wei et al 2014 chang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a 2019b the asrnc suffer from serious water distribution problems chen et al 2015 however strong signals of the climatic shift from dry to humid have been found in this region shi et al 2002 gu et al 2015 yang et al 2021 pw is one of the possible reasons for the climate transformation in northwest china shi et al 2003 therefore the climate shift in the asrnc during 1980 2018 have been explored in this paper based on meteorological data and pw data from observation and six reanalysis products however the outputs of models are always different from the observations due to the different realizations of internal climate variabilities wang et al 2016 wu et al 2017 compared with the observed pw the reanalysis data sets overestimated the pw in the north of the central region while underestimated the pw over the high altitude area in xinjiang however the spatial distribution of simulated pw was more consistent with the topography characteristics of the study region due to the scarce radiosonde stations located in the asrnc zhao and zhou 2020 indicated that most reanalysis products could reproduce the annual mean pw well in the tibetan plateau as well generally the reanalysis products overestimated the pw in spring especially for cfsr while underestimated the pw in summer autumn and winter especially for cra and jra 55 this phenomenon was consistent with the conclusion of zhao et al 2015 and matsuyama et al 2020 the large biases in reanalysis products resulted mainly from the spurious changes in the assimilated raw humidity data from radiosondes and the varying role of satellite observations in each reanalysis zhao et al 2015 overall era interim and jra 55 reproduced the spatial distribution of pw much better while cra performed the best in terms of temporal simulation almost entire northwest china has continuously warmed since the second half of the 20th century due to the weakening of siberian high and the increase in greenhouse emissions li et al 2012 yang et al 2021 meanwhile because global warming could enhance the northward transport of moisture from the tropical indian ocean shi et al 2007 the pw was expected to increase with climate warming held and soden 2000 zhao et al 2012 in fact we did discover that the spatial distribution of pw was similar to that of temperature however the influences of temperature rise on the pw were more complicated in the asrnc guo and wang 2014 in the context of regional warming the regions where the pw increased significantly were concentrated in the areas with high 5 k and increasing pw scaling in contrast in the regions where the response of pw to warming was scaled to be below 3 k the pw usually presented a reduction trend generally over the asrnc all pw products presented a continued fluctuating upward trend from 1980 to 2000 and the increasing trend intensified after 2000 the increasing rates of simulated pw were dramatically underestimated during 2000 2018 due to the great underestimation of pw from six reanalysis products after 2011 this situation was consistent with previous studies emphasizing that the pw increased from the 1980s with the intensification of global warming liu and zhang 2011 liu et al 2018 however the increase of pw in the 21st century was contrary to some studies due to the differences in time scale and data sets for example wang et al 2018 indicated that the pw decreased from the late 1990s to the early 21st century based on the ecmwf and ncep ncar reanalysis of the climate data the decreasing trend during this period was found in this paper as well meanwhile zhang et al 2018 declared that the pw decreased slightly during 2003 2013 using the high altitude and ground meteorological data which was contrary to our study this might be due to the l band remodeling of the chinese sonde in 2002 zhang et al 2018 the pw in the asrnc is mainly transported by the westerly winds wang et al 2005 and the increase in water vapor transport caused by the intensified westerly wind circulation would bring more precipitation to northwest china zhang et al 2017 except for a few parts of xinjiang eastern inner mongolia and the southern edge the precipitation there was positively correlated with the pw however sufficient pw is only one of the conditions for the formation of precipitation meanwhile because of the interception of mountains only parts of the pw could reach the inland of northwest china cheng and wang 2006 zhang et al 2012a 2012b among them some airflow becomes downdraft and is not easy to form clouds to produce precipitation cheng and wang 2006 therefore influenced by the conversion efficiency of precipitation zhang et al 2017 high pw did not always mean high precipitation for example the rare rainfall in the tarim river basin was mainly caused by low conversion efficiency similarly although the pw in the south of the study region increased significantly the precipitation there remained stable because of the reduction of precipitation conversion efficiency generally the seasonal and annual fluctuations of precipitation conversion efficiency were quite similar to that of precipitation the changes in precipitation were mainly affected by the conversion efficiency of precipitation in spring and autumn while the changes in precipitation varied with the changes of pw in summer and winter northwest china straddles the northern edge of the east asian summer monsoon and the northern edge of the summer monsoon divides the asrnc into the west and the east zhang et al 2022 the west region is primarily influenced by westerly circulation while the east region is mainly affected by monsoon circulation zhang et al 2019a 2019b therefore there are huge differences in the trends of precipitation between the west and the east in general the increase in precipitation was concentrated in western and central areas due to the increase in both pw and precipitation conversion efficiency which was similar to the study of zhang et al 2022 overall the precipitation increased in most areas of the asrnc during 1980 2018 which was consistent with previous studies revealing that northwest china has become wet since the 1980 s shi et al 2002 zhang et al 2012a 2022 2012b gu et al 2015 wang et al 2018a 2018b yang et al 2021 the findings of this paper could help understand the climate transformation in the arid and semi arid regions of china and central asia 5 conclusions in this paper based on six pw reanalysis data sets and observed pw temperature precipitation data sets the climate shift in the asrnc during 1980 2018 have been investigated by applying the reference pw scaling and conversion efficiency of precipitation the major results were summarized below 1 the reanalysis products overestimated the pw in spring while underestimated the pw in summer autumn and winter however compared with the observation the spatial distribution of simulated pw was more consistent with the topography characteristics of the asrnc overall era interim and jra 55 reproduced the spatial distribution of pw better while cra performed the best in terms of temporal simulation meanwhile cfsr performed the worst in spatial simulation and era5 performed the worst in representing the temporal variation 2 from 1980 2018 the temperature increased significantly over almost entire asrnc in the context of regional warming the pw was more likely to present significant upward trends over the regions with high and increasing pw scaling in general the pw of the arid and semi arid regions increased slightly before 2000 the continual fluctuating increasing trend intensified thereafter the increasing rates of pw from six reanalysis products were dramatically underestimated in the 21st century 3 in the asrnc the spatial distribution and variations of precipitation were influenced by the precipitation conversion efficiency especially in spring and autumn generally due to the increase in both pw and precipitation conversion efficiency the wet tendency was identified in most of the west and center of the arid and semi arid regions from 1980 to 2018 the conclusions of this paper could help understand the latest variation of pw and climate in arid and semi arid regions of other countries funding

7918,study region arid and semi arid regions of northwest china study focus precipitable water vapor pw is the medium for energy and water exchange and supplies moisture for precipitation based on meteorological data and pw data from observation and six reanalysis products the climate shift in the arid and semi arid regions of northwest china asrnc during 1980 2018 have been explored by applying the reference pw scaling and conversion efficiency of precipitation new hydrological insights for the region the pw of reanalysis data sets was overestimated in spring while was underestimated in summer autumn and winter however the spatial distribution of simulated pw was more consistent with the topography of the asrnc from 1980 2018 in the context of overall regional warming the pw was more likely to present significant increasing trends over the regions with high and increasing pw scaling in general the pw increased from 1980 to 2000 the fluctuating upward trend intensified thereafter meanwhile the increasing rates of simulated pw were remarkably underestimated during 2000 2018 the precipitation in the asrnc was greatly influenced by the precipitation conversion efficiency especially in spring and autumn generally the wet tendency was identified in the western and central regions because of the increase in pw and precipitation conversion efficiency from 1980 to 2018 graphical abstract ga1 keywords arid and semi arid regions of china precipitable water vapor pw scaling precipitation conversion efficiency climatic shift 1 introduction in recent years greenhouse gas emissions have caused a dramatic and sustained increase in mean surface temperatures especially in china wu et al 2020 the anthropogenic global warming progresses would increase the frequency of droughts and expand the area of extremely dry land dai et al 2004 hou et al 2020 water vapor is the single most plentiful greenhouse gas in the atmosphere held and soden 2000 dai et al 2011 zhang and zhao 2018 water vapor increases in a warmer world will amplify the climatic influences on the other greenhouse gases held and soden 2000 therefore as climate warming because of the increase in co2 and other greenhouse gases atmospheric water vapor is expected to increase this highly enhances the warming in turn zhao et al 2012 several papers have discovered an increasing trend in precipitable water vapor pw over many places around the globe zhao et al 2012 disclosed that the pw increased in most regions of china from 1970 to 2008 especially in north china under the framework of phase 5 of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 numerous papers zhang and zhao 2018 zhang et al 2019a 2019b discovered that the pw of china has increased since 1970 due to the anthropogenic forcing based on the papers about atmospheric water resources liu et al 2018 found that the pw over the arid and semi arid areas of east asia has presented sharply upward trends since the mid 1980s especially in summer wang et al 2016 revealed that the pw had a global increasing trend during 1995 2011 by using the newly homogenized radiosonde data global positioning system pw data and microwave satellite dataset pw is the medium for earth s energy and water exchange and transport and could provide water resources for the formation of precipitation dai et al 2011 wang et al 2016 generally pw was one of the major influencing factors driving the trend of humidification zhang et al 2017 and was positively correlated with precipitation zhao et al 2010 therefore the increase in pw as global warming might ease the water shortage in china the arid and semi arid regions of northwest china asrnc which are situated deeply inland with scarce precipitation and intensive evapotranspiration chang et al 2018 suffer from the increasingly serious mismatch between water resources and the spatial distribution of productivity chen et al 2015 overall the internal water cycle of the asrnc is quite inactive cheng and wang 2006 cold and drought are common impressions there however due to the weakening of the siberian high and the rising of the greenhouse emission the temperature over northwest china had a great increasing trend which is higher than that in china li et al 2012 a warming climate could accelerate the water cycle there douville et al 2002 chen et al 2015 2016 gu et al 2015 ma 2007 discovered a persistent process of climate change in the central part of north china during 1951 2005 gu et al 2015 disclosed that temperature precipitation and the frequency of floods increased persistently after the mid 1980s shi et al 2002 pointed out that a series of signals from the warm dry climate to the warm humid climate have been found in xinjiang since 1987 yang et al 2021 found that eastern northwest china has experienced a dry to wet climate transition since the late 1990s due to the synergistic enhancement of the east asian summer monsoon and westerly circulation zhang et al 2022 also disclosed that a humidification trend was found in northwest china at the beginning of the 21st century the increase in pw was one of the possible reasons for the climate shift over northwest china shi et al 2003 a fluctuating upward trend of pw was found in the asrnc with the intensification of global warming liu and zhang 2011 liu et al 2018 however the influences of temperature rise on the hydrological cycle of meltwater water based regions in northwest china are complicated guo and wang 2014 therefore the variation of pw in the asrnc is controversial yao et al 2018 disclosed that the pw and precipitation of the arid region of northwest china increased dramatically in the late 1980s but decreased obviously after 2000 chen et al 2019 revealed that the pw over the arid region of northwest china experienced a significant increase trend during 1970 2002 while the obvious increase was replaced by a slight decrease from 2003 to 2013 in any case the increase in temperature brought new opportunities to the asrnc the understanding of the climatic shift as well as its evolution mechanisms in the arid and semi arid regions of china has been limited so far although numerous papers have explored the changes of pw in the arid regions of northwest china only a few papers comprehensively investigate the climate shift based on pw temperature and precipitation fewer studies researched the relationship between the pw changes and temperature precipitation variations in the asrnc overall the warming and wetting trend in the 21st century is still inexplicit thus the main aims of this paper were 1 to explore the latest variation of pw in the arid and semi arid regions of china 2 to probe whether the pw change could indicate further warming and humidification of climate the results of this paper could help understand the climate transformation in the arid and semi arid regions of central asia 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area and data the asrnc are located in the north of the great wall and kunlun mountains including the whole of xinjiang inner mongolia northern ningxia western gansu and the qaidam basin in qinghai and covering around one third of china s territory qu 1986 hua et al 2016 to preserve the integrity of the region xinjiang gansu inner mongolia ningxia and qinghai were selected as the study area chang et al 2018 fig 1 this region is affected by the interactions among the summer monsoon the westerlies and the plateau monsoon zhang et al 2019a 2019b and is controlled by arid and semi arid climates the main terrains there are plateaus basins and mountains including the tibetan plateau the inner mongolia plateau the tarim river basin the qaidam basin and the qilian mountains wei et al 2014 zhang et al 2019a 2019b the mountains such as tianshan mountains would block the routine of pw zhang et al 2012a 2012b therefore the spatio temporal climate variations in the asrnc are complex in this paper the homogenized twice daily radiosonde humidity records over the asrnc were updated to 2018 applying the homogenized approach developed by dai et al 2011 to ensure the reliability the homogenized sounding data from 31 radiosonde stations of this region with more than 85 valid records during 1980 2018 were selected in this paper fig 1 these homogenized humidity records performed well in exhibiting spatially coherent long term trends zhang and zhao 2018 the observed pw was calculated by integrating the specific humidity from radiosonde observations from the surface to 300 hpa and reflected the total water vapor content for the entire tropospheric column zhao et al 2015 zhang and zhao 2018 to facilitate the comparisons and research the monthly mean from the stations was regridded onto a common 1 1 grid using the cressman interpolation technique cressman 1959 the observed precipitation and temperature data used in this paper were the monthly gridded precipitation and temperature products from the national meteorological science data center during 1980 2018 with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 http data cma cn the monthly simulated pw data were obtained from six reanalysis products directly thereinto the era interim reanalysis has been upgraded to the era5 reanalysis except for the jra 55 and merra2 the other four reanalysis data sets used in this paper were all available from 1979 when the satellite was put into use zhao and zhou 2020 the details of the six reanalysis data sets were provided in table 1 for consistency the time period of all data used in this paper was all from 1980 to 2018 2 2 methodology the centered root mean square difference rmsd and correlation coefficient cc were used in this paper to quantitatively evaluate the skill of reanalysis products over the asrnc to compute spatial rmsd and cc the data of all gridded pw data sets were interpolated to precipitation and temperature fine resolution by using the inverse distance weighted idw method then the spatial correlation and rmsd were computed at the 0 5 grid scale as for the assessment of reanalysis data in representing the temporal variation of pw raw gridded data were used the centered rmsd is defined by cheng 2016 1 rmsd 1 n n 1 n x n x x obsn x obs 2 where x obs and x are the mean values of gridded observation and reanalysis data sets respectively the cc between gridded observation and reanalysis data sets is defined as 2 cc 1 n n 1 n x n x x obsn x obs σ re σ obs where σ re and σ obs are the standard deviations of reanalysis data and gridded observation the pw scaling and conversion efficiency of precipitation were used in this paper to explore the relationship between pw and temperature and the connection between pw and precipitation the reference pw scaling at each grid was obtained by applying the percentage variations of 0 5 regridded pw scaled by raw atmosphere temperature changes at the corresponding grid liang and zhang 2021 the variations were calculated as the differences between the periods of 1980 2018 and 1980 1999 the conversion efficiency of precipitation was calculated by using total annual precipitation divided by the corresponding 0 5 regridded annual pw from 1980 to 2018 zhao et al 2010 3 results 3 1 pw is still increasing in the 21st century over the asrnc in this paper the grid values of six reanalysis data sets have been interpolated to various stations using the idw method to evaluate the performance of simulated pw fig 2 compared with the pw of point observation all reanalysis overestimated the pw in northern gansu eastern xinjiang and the north of western inner mongolia to facilitate further research the regridded observation was adopted in this paper therefore the simulated pw data sets at the grid scale were also evaluated based on gridded observed pw fig s1 in supplementary material it could be seen that except for qinghai all reanalysis data products underestimated the pw in the regions with high altitudes however the spatial distribution of simulated pw was more consistent with the terrain and topography characteristics in the asrnc because the radiosonde stations there were scarce fig 1 and fig s1 in supplementary material based on the gridded observation the centered rmsd of era interim 1 61 mm and jra 55 1 55 mm were lower and the spatial correlation of the two reanalysis sets ccera interim 0 7780 ccjra 55 0 7550 were higher therefore in terms of spatial simulation era interim and jra 55 performed the best over the asrnc meanwhile the cfsr performed the worst in representing the spatial pattern of pw due to the highest centered rmsd 2 23 mm and the lowest spatial cc 0 6505 it was worth noting that the upgraded era products did not show an advantage in the asrnc compared with the era interim the era5 had higher centered rmsd 2 13 mm and lower cc 0 6799 in general over the study region the observation decreased from northwest and southeast 12 mm to the center 6 mm while the simulated pw decreased from east and northwest 12 mm to southwest 6 mm changing trends of pw in the asrnc during 1980 2018 at the point and grid scales were analyzed as well overall the variation of point pw was highly consistent with that of the gridded pw however the decreasing trends of gridded observation were more significant in xinjiang qinghai northern gansu and inner mongolia fig 3a and fig s2a in supplementary material generally the observed pw increased significantly over the asrnc except for parts of xinjiang southern qinghai gansu and eastern inner mongolia as for the cfsr era interim and ear5 the prominent increasing trends in pw during 1980 2018 were concentrated in the south fig 3b d e and fig s2b d e in supplementary material the pw of cra jra 55 and merra2 even presented significantly upward trends throughout almost the entire study region fig 3c f g and fig s2c f g in supplementary material in general except for parts of xinjiang and eastern inner mongolia the pw increased from 1980 to 2018 in the asrnc over the asrnc the warming and wetting trends were still inexplicit in the 21st century therefore the inter annual progression of seasonal annual mean pw and inter decadal variations of pw derived from two observations and six reanalysis data sets were analyzed as was shown in fig 4 and fig s3 in supplementary material the seasonal and annual mean pw fluctuations of point and gridded observations along with the ranges of various decadal changes between the two sets of observations were quite similar however from 1980 to 2000 the gridded pw in summer and autumn were mildly lower than the pw of stations resulting in a slightly lower annual gridded pw fig 4b c e generally the pw in the asrnc was concentrated in summer the pw in autumn was slightly higher than that in spring while the pw in winter was the lowest all reanalysis products caught the changing trends of observed pw well during 1980 2018 over the asrnc however the reanalysis data products overestimated the pw in spring especially for cfsr during 1980 1989 and 2006 2011 fig 4a in summer autumn and winter the pw from all reanalysis data products was underestimated especially for cra and jra 55 fig 4b d generally cra and jra 55 distinctly underestimated the pw while cfsr slightly overestimated the pw in the 1980s during 1997 2005 all the modeled annual pw performed relatively well due to the good performance in summer all six reanalysis sets sharply underestimated the pw after 2011 in all seasons therefore the increasing rates of pw simulated by reanalysis data sets were greatly underestimated in the 21st century over the asrnc in fact the annual observed pw increased gradually before 2000 slope 0 0325 the upward trend intensified thereafter slope 0 0672 fig 4e the same phenomenon was found in spring summer and autumn fig 4a c in winter the observed pw increased gradually before 2000 slope 0 0180 while the changing trend turned into reduction trends during 2000 2018 slope 0 0227 fig 4d in general the pw of two observed data sets cra jra 55 and merra2 exhibited a continually inter decadal increase from 1980 to 2018 while the continually pw increasing trend was not distinct in cfsr era interim and era5 fig s3 in supplementary material the temporal correlation and rmsd of six reanalysis products based on gridded observation were presented in table 2 it could be seen that the temporal cc values of reanalysis data products were all more than 0 5651 in the asrnc thereinto cra owned the lowest centered rmsd 0 25 mm and the highest similarity with gridded observation 0 8778 hence cra performed the best among six reanalysis data sets over the asrnc on the contrary era5 had the highest centered rmsd 0 44 mm and the lowest temporal correlation 0 5651 therefore era5 performed the worst in representing the temporal variation of pw over the study region it also meant that the upgraded era products did not show an advantage in representing the temporal changes as well 3 2 the response of pw to continual warming over the asrnc a mechanistic understanding of pw changes is necessary thus the spatial distribution and changing trends of annual mean temperature over the asrnc were analyzed in fig 5a b to explore the response of pw to temperature in the asrnc the atmosphere temperature was negatively correlated with the altitude fig 5a the lowest temperature 4 occurred in the tibetan plateau on the southwest edge of the study region while the temperature in the tarim river basin was the highest 10 combined with the spatial distribution of simulated pw fig s1b g in supplementary material it could be found that the region with higher temperature had higher pw as was presented in fig 5b except for parts of xinjiang and northern inner mongolia presenting slight warming trends the atmosphere temperature increased significantly over entire asrnc from 1980 to 2018 the scaling of pw change with temperature was investigated to further explore the response of pw to continual warming in the asrnc as was shown in fig s2 in supplementary material and fig 6 in the context of regional warming the changing trends of pw were quite similar to the spatial distribution of pw scaling generally in the regions where the response of pw to warming was scaled to be below 3 k the pw usually presented a reduction trend the pw was relatively stable in the areas where the pw scaling ranged from 3 k to 0 k in the regions where the pw scaling was greater than 5 k the pw tended to increase significantly from 1980 to 2018 the changing trends of scaling of pw with temperature in the asrnc from 1980 to 2018 were investigated in fig 7 it could be seen that except for parts of xinjiang eastern inner mongolia and southern regions the response of pw to warming increased in most areas of the study region based on observation cfsr cra jra 55 and merra2 fig 7a c f g as for era interim and era5 the increase of pw scaling was concentrated in the center of the asrnc fig 7d e overall except for era interim and era5 the pw was more likely to present significant increasing trends in the areas with pw scaling increasing from 1980 to 2018 fig s2a c f g in supplementary material and fig 7a c f g 3 3 will more pw bring more precipitation over the asrnc this paper further explored whether the increase of pw would bring more precipitation over the asrnc fig s4 in supplementary material illustrated that precipitation was positively correlated with pw in most regions of the asrnc on the contrary in a few areas of xinjiang eastern inner mongolia and southern region the precipitation was negatively correlated with pw however sufficient pw is only one of the conditions for the formation of precipitation more pw did not always bring more precipitation therefore in some regions the correlations of the pw and precipitation were not significant generally the highest precipitation 600 mm occurred in the south of the study region while the lowest precipitation 100 mm was concentrated in the tarim river basin with high pw and temperature fig s1 in supplementary material and fig 5a c except for parts of xinjiang eastern inner mongolia and the southeastern edge the precipitation increased in almost entire arid and semi arid regions fig 5d areas with increasing pw were more likely to present an increasing trend in precipitation fig s2 in supplementary material and fig 5d therefore in the asrnc high pw did not mean high precipitation but there was a certain consistency between the changes of pw and precipitation the conversion efficiency of annual mean precipitation was applied to further investigate the relationship between precipitation and pw in the asrnc as was presented in fig 8 the spatial patterns of simulated conversion efficiency were highly similar to those of observed ones the highest precipitation conversion efficiency 20 was concentrated in the regions with high altitudes 4500 m while the lowest conversion efficiency of precipitation 2 occurred in the tarim river basin overall the distribution of conversion efficiency was generally consistent with that of precipitation figs 5c and 8 therefore it could be considered that the amount of precipitation depended on the conversion efficiency of precipitation over the asrnc in the tarim river basin the pw was high while the precipitation conversion efficiency was low so the precipitation there was quite low in the east of inner mongolia the precipitation was relatively high due to the high pw and conversion efficiency as for the south of northwest china the reasons for the high precipitation in southern qinghai and southern gansu were different in the south of qinghai although the pw was low the conversion efficiency was very high so the precipitation there was still high in contrast extremely high pw and low precipitation conversion efficiency together brought comparatively high precipitation in the south of gansu as was shown in fig 9 the changing trends of precipitation conversion efficiency from observation and six reanalysis data sets were generally the same over the asrnc during 1980 2018 overall the changing trend of conversion efficiency of annual mean precipitation was consistent with that of precipitation figs 5d and 9 the reduction of conversion efficiency was concentrated in xinjiang eastern inner mongolia and the southern part meanwhile the increase in precipitation conversion efficiency was mainly located in the western and central regions it could be seen that in the regions with conversion efficiency decreasing and no changing trends the correlations between pw and precipitation were more likely to be insignificant fig s4 in supplementary material and fig 9 generally the decrease in pw and precipitation conversion efficiency resulted in a decrease in precipitation in some regions of xinjiang and eastern inner mongolia fig s2 in supplementary material fig 5d and fig 9 in the south of the study region although the pw increased significantly the precipitation remained constant due to the reduction of conversion efficiency from 1980 to 2018 over most regions of western and central areas the precipitation increased with the increase of pw and precipitation conversion efficiency overall whether the increment of pw would bring more precipitation was largely determined by the conversion efficiency of annual mean precipitation the inter annual progressions of seasonal and annual mean precipitation and precipitation conversion efficiency were analyzed as well fig 10 in general the precipitation in spring and autumn decreased from 1980 to 2000 and presented upward trends thereafter oppositely in winter the precipitation increased before 2000 while decreased after 2000 in summer the precipitation increased during 1980 2000 slope 0 2576 then the upward trend intensified dramatically during 2000 2018 slope 1 7514 in the asrnc the precipitation was concentrated in summer while the precipitation in winter was negligible therefore the annual precipitation there presented an increasing trend during 1980 2000 slope 0 1779 the upward trend greatly intensified after that slope 3 1090 all reanalysis data sets could reproduce the seasonal and annual precipitation conversion efficiency fluctuations of observation well however compared with the precipitation conversion efficiency of gridded observation the six reanalysis products slightly underestimated the precipitation conversion efficiency in spring fig 10a in contrast the simulated conversion efficiency of precipitation was overestimated in autumn and winter fig 10c d therefore generally the annual precipitation conversion efficiency was mildly overestimated fig 10e it could be seen that the seasonal and annual fluctuations of precipitation conversion efficiency were quite similar to that of precipitation as was shown in fig 10a c in spring summer and autumn the conversion efficiency of precipitation decreased before 2000 while presenting upward trends thereafter in winter the precipitation conversion efficiency increased gradually before 2000 slope 0 0211 then the increasing trend greatly intensified slope 0 0760 the changing trends of annual precipitation conversion efficiency were consistent with those of spring summer and autumn in general over the asrnc the fluctuations of precipitation were affected by pw and precipitation conversion efficiency together figs 4 and 10 in spring and autumn the pw continually increased and the changes in precipitation were mainly affected by the precipitation conversion efficiency as for summer and winter the changes in precipitation varied with the changes in pw 4 discussions because of the unique location and inactive internal water cycle cheng and wang 2006 wei et al 2014 chang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a 2019b the asrnc suffer from serious water distribution problems chen et al 2015 however strong signals of the climatic shift from dry to humid have been found in this region shi et al 2002 gu et al 2015 yang et al 2021 pw is one of the possible reasons for the climate transformation in northwest china shi et al 2003 therefore the climate shift in the asrnc during 1980 2018 have been explored in this paper based on meteorological data and pw data from observation and six reanalysis products however the outputs of models are always different from the observations due to the different realizations of internal climate variabilities wang et al 2016 wu et al 2017 compared with the observed pw the reanalysis data sets overestimated the pw in the north of the central region while underestimated the pw over the high altitude area in xinjiang however the spatial distribution of simulated pw was more consistent with the topography characteristics of the study region due to the scarce radiosonde stations located in the asrnc zhao and zhou 2020 indicated that most reanalysis products could reproduce the annual mean pw well in the tibetan plateau as well generally the reanalysis products overestimated the pw in spring especially for cfsr while underestimated the pw in summer autumn and winter especially for cra and jra 55 this phenomenon was consistent with the conclusion of zhao et al 2015 and matsuyama et al 2020 the large biases in reanalysis products resulted mainly from the spurious changes in the assimilated raw humidity data from radiosondes and the varying role of satellite observations in each reanalysis zhao et al 2015 overall era interim and jra 55 reproduced the spatial distribution of pw much better while cra performed the best in terms of temporal simulation almost entire northwest china has continuously warmed since the second half of the 20th century due to the weakening of siberian high and the increase in greenhouse emissions li et al 2012 yang et al 2021 meanwhile because global warming could enhance the northward transport of moisture from the tropical indian ocean shi et al 2007 the pw was expected to increase with climate warming held and soden 2000 zhao et al 2012 in fact we did discover that the spatial distribution of pw was similar to that of temperature however the influences of temperature rise on the pw were more complicated in the asrnc guo and wang 2014 in the context of regional warming the regions where the pw increased significantly were concentrated in the areas with high 5 k and increasing pw scaling in contrast in the regions where the response of pw to warming was scaled to be below 3 k the pw usually presented a reduction trend generally over the asrnc all pw products presented a continued fluctuating upward trend from 1980 to 2000 and the increasing trend intensified after 2000 the increasing rates of simulated pw were dramatically underestimated during 2000 2018 due to the great underestimation of pw from six reanalysis products after 2011 this situation was consistent with previous studies emphasizing that the pw increased from the 1980s with the intensification of global warming liu and zhang 2011 liu et al 2018 however the increase of pw in the 21st century was contrary to some studies due to the differences in time scale and data sets for example wang et al 2018 indicated that the pw decreased from the late 1990s to the early 21st century based on the ecmwf and ncep ncar reanalysis of the climate data the decreasing trend during this period was found in this paper as well meanwhile zhang et al 2018 declared that the pw decreased slightly during 2003 2013 using the high altitude and ground meteorological data which was contrary to our study this might be due to the l band remodeling of the chinese sonde in 2002 zhang et al 2018 the pw in the asrnc is mainly transported by the westerly winds wang et al 2005 and the increase in water vapor transport caused by the intensified westerly wind circulation would bring more precipitation to northwest china zhang et al 2017 except for a few parts of xinjiang eastern inner mongolia and the southern edge the precipitation there was positively correlated with the pw however sufficient pw is only one of the conditions for the formation of precipitation meanwhile because of the interception of mountains only parts of the pw could reach the inland of northwest china cheng and wang 2006 zhang et al 2012a 2012b among them some airflow becomes downdraft and is not easy to form clouds to produce precipitation cheng and wang 2006 therefore influenced by the conversion efficiency of precipitation zhang et al 2017 high pw did not always mean high precipitation for example the rare rainfall in the tarim river basin was mainly caused by low conversion efficiency similarly although the pw in the south of the study region increased significantly the precipitation there remained stable because of the reduction of precipitation conversion efficiency generally the seasonal and annual fluctuations of precipitation conversion efficiency were quite similar to that of precipitation the changes in precipitation were mainly affected by the conversion efficiency of precipitation in spring and autumn while the changes in precipitation varied with the changes of pw in summer and winter northwest china straddles the northern edge of the east asian summer monsoon and the northern edge of the summer monsoon divides the asrnc into the west and the east zhang et al 2022 the west region is primarily influenced by westerly circulation while the east region is mainly affected by monsoon circulation zhang et al 2019a 2019b therefore there are huge differences in the trends of precipitation between the west and the east in general the increase in precipitation was concentrated in western and central areas due to the increase in both pw and precipitation conversion efficiency which was similar to the study of zhang et al 2022 overall the precipitation increased in most areas of the asrnc during 1980 2018 which was consistent with previous studies revealing that northwest china has become wet since the 1980 s shi et al 2002 zhang et al 2012a 2022 2012b gu et al 2015 wang et al 2018a 2018b yang et al 2021 the findings of this paper could help understand the climate transformation in the arid and semi arid regions of china and central asia 5 conclusions in this paper based on six pw reanalysis data sets and observed pw temperature precipitation data sets the climate shift in the asrnc during 1980 2018 have been investigated by applying the reference pw scaling and conversion efficiency of precipitation the major results were summarized below 1 the reanalysis products overestimated the pw in spring while underestimated the pw in summer autumn and winter however compared with the observation the spatial distribution of simulated pw was more consistent with the topography characteristics of the asrnc overall era interim and jra 55 reproduced the spatial distribution of pw better while cra performed the best in terms of temporal simulation meanwhile cfsr performed the worst in spatial simulation and era5 performed the worst in representing the temporal variation 2 from 1980 2018 the temperature increased significantly over almost entire asrnc in the context of regional warming the pw was more likely to present significant upward trends over the regions with high and increasing pw scaling in general the pw of the arid and semi arid regions increased slightly before 2000 the continual fluctuating increasing trend intensified thereafter the increasing rates of pw from six reanalysis products were dramatically underestimated in the 21st century 3 in the asrnc the spatial distribution and variations of precipitation were influenced by the precipitation conversion efficiency especially in spring and autumn generally due to the increase in both pw and precipitation conversion efficiency the wet tendency was identified in most of the west and center of the arid and semi arid regions from 1980 to 2018 the conclusions of this paper could help understand the latest variation of pw and climate in arid and semi arid regions of other countries funding

7919,study region the qilian mountains northwest china study focus trends in flood frequency and their driving factors must be analyzed to enable the effective management of water resources in the inland rivers originating in the qilian mountains qms based on hydrological station datasets from 12 typical rivers with annual maximum peak discharge and peaks over threshold pot flood series for the period 1970 2019 the spatial and temporal variations of flooding in 12 rivers were detected using a linear regression estimator and mann kendall trend tests new hydrological insights the results indicate that the frequency of pot floods in 12 rivers during 1970 2019 showed an increasing trend at the 90 significance level with an increasing trend for small floods and decreasing trends for medium and large floods flood levels varied from east to west across the region with an overall decreasing trend in the east an increase in small floods in the central rivers and significant increases in both small and medium floods in the west both temperature and precipitation increased after 1987 and summer precipitation was a significantly increased as a result pot floods in most rivers increased after the 1980 s and trends in flood frequency showed decreases in spring and autumn and an increase in summer the main causes of the changes in flood frequency were found to be heavy rainfall abnormal warming and accelerated glacial melting keywords trends flood frequency peaks over threshold climate change qilian mountains data availability statement meteorological data are collected by the national climate center of the china meteorological administration and available on http data cma cn under request flood data are collected by bureau of hydrology and water resources of gansu province china and available under request 1 introduction climate change dominated by global warming ipcc 2021 has become one of the most important environmental issues in the world today betts 2011 global climate change has led to temperature increases extreme weather frequent climatic events and induces accelerated hydrological cycles at global and continental scales zhang et al 2013 ziegler et al 2003 as such the effects of climate change have aroused great concern and substantial interest from governments and researchers worldwide murray and ebi 2012 river floods are one of the most destructive types of natural disasters catastrophic flooding of different types i e fluvial pluvial and coastal flooding has gained public awareness and caused increasingly severe events over the past few decades with an estimated average annual global cost of us 104 billion desai et al 2015 extreme flooding events are projected to increase with ongoing climate change urbanization and economic growth hallegatte et al 2013 hirabayashi et al 2013 there are growing concerns over river floods due to changes in the magnitude frequency and trends of flooding events at catchment continental or global scales recent studies have indicated that climate change has both increased in northwestern europe and decreased in medium and large catchments in southern europe the frequency of river flooding events bloeschl et al 2019 bloschl et al 2017 anthropogenic climate change was expected to increase flood risk through more frequent intense precipitation increased catchment wetness and sea level rise wilby and keenan 2012 studies have highlighted increasing changes in extreme flood events and future flood projections in the context of climate change indicating that their frequency of occurrence is likely to increase in the future archfield et al 2014 chen et al 2021 murray and ebi 2012 zadeh et al 2020 magnitude and frequency of floods across china has been projected to increase by varying degrees under 54 different warming scenarios gu et al 2021 kundzewicz et al 2019a liang et al 2019 and flood risk increased in several areas between 1961 and 2017 kundzewicz et al 2019b yang et al 2019 presented a characterization of flood hazards across china and indicated there has been a decrease in flood hazards in recent decades xiong et al 2020 proposed that the magnitude of the annual maximum peak discharge in the yangtze river has shown a decreasing trend since 1998 accompanied by periodic fluctuations in summer precipitation anomalies mao et al 2012 found there is a link between extreme flooding and climate change that has occurred in arid and semi arid regions of northwest china over the past 50 years such as in typical watersheds in the tianshan mountains and that extreme flooding events are increasing in different regions in xinjiang with southern xinjiang showing a significant increase zhang et al 2016 studied flooding in the tarim river basin particularly in high latitude rivers where they found that floods are mainly attributable to intense precipitation and glacial melting with rainstorm and temperature induced floods being dominant the impact of climate change on river floods remains an important area of research because of the complexities surrounding changes in precipitation underlying surface conditions and the hydrological cycle the qilian mountains qms are the source and runoff formation area of inland rivers in the hexi corridor which is a typical arid semi arid region in northwest china zhang et al 2015 the inland rivers that originate in the qms flow through the hexi corridor and disappear into the oases in the north nevertheless mountainous areas located at high altitudes of qms have special and typical flood generation mechanisms where heavy rainfall and melting ice and snow water due to temperature increase are the main factors generating floods understanding the trends in the frequency changes of floods in the context of climate change is important for understanding the patterns of water resources changes sustainable water resources management and environmental protection in northwest china chen et al 2021 although numerous studies have been conducted on hydrological factors in arid inland river basins in northwest china these studies have focused mainly on the impact of climate change on runoff li et al 2020 ma et al 2008 wang and qin 2017 and few studies have focused on the correlation between climate change and flood risk factors zhang et al 2016 most studies on flood risk factors under the influence of climate change have not been sufficiently comprehensive moreover the limited geographical source environmental complexity and length and quality of collated historical hydrological data for arid and semi arid inland river basins have greatly limited our understanding of the impacts of climate change on flooding as the temperature and precipitation in northwest china showed an increase after 1987 chen et al 2015 the effects of such changes on river floods in the region remains unknown in this study we comprehensively assessed the impact of the changing climate on flood frequency in the qms using hydrological data and meteorological records for the period 1970 2019 the main objectives of our study were 1 to evaluate the spatial and temporal distributions of peaks over threshold pot flood series 2 to ascertain the trends of different levels and types of pot flood series at different temporal and regional scales and 3 to explore the driving factors of changes in flood frequency including the relationship between meteorological factors and flood characteristics 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the qms are located in the geographical boundary of about 93 4 103 4 e and 35 8 40 0 n across the northeast qinghai tibetan plateau and northwest china and extend 800 km from northwest to southeast and 200 km from south to north wang et al 2019b the hexi corridor inland region 92 4 104 2 e 37 3 42 3 n is located in the north of the qm region with a total area of 2 15 105 km2 the qm region is composed of several parallel mountain belts and wide valleys orient northwest to southeast the elevation of the region ranges from 3000 to 5000 m with most peaks exceeding 4000 m wang et al 2019b snow cover is typically present all year round on the mountains above 4000 m and glaciers are more abundant in the west than in the east cao et al 2014 gao et al 2011 tian et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 the climate shows substantial variation with altitude and most precipitation events in high mountain areas are influenced by three main sources of water vapor i e westerly flow the east asian monsoon and the tibetan plateau monsoon zhang et al 2008 the qms are the runoff formation area and source of several major rivers and the region has a mean annual rainfall of 301 9 mm wang et al 2019a in this study we selected 12 rivers fig 1 that originate from the qms and terminate in the northern oasis of the hexi corridor the rivers are distributed across three main basins from east to west i e the shiyang river basin syrb the hei river basin hrb and the shule river basin slrb respectively the characteristics of these rivers are listed in table 1 2 2 data twelve rivers originating from the qms were selected for analysis of trends in flood frequency fig 1 table 1 these rivers were pristine and almost free from human influence the dataset used in this paper was compiled from climate data and historical flood discharge data climate data were obtained from the national meteorological centre of the china meteorological administration and flood discharge data were collected from the bureau of hydrology and water resources of gansu province general flood information is shown in table 1 and information on the meteorological stations in the qms is given in table 2 our analysis was based on a series of observations of annual maximum peak discharge and pot flood series from 12 hydrological stations with continuous records over the period 1970 2019 i e three stations in the syrb six stations in the hrb and three stations in the slrb there are considerable variations in the spatial scales of the representative river basins with a large percentage 78 of the stations representing small and medium sized river basins drainage areas 5000 km2 table 1 the data have been subject to strict quality control procedures to ensure data consistency and accuracy by following the procedure for hydrological data compilation of china sl247 2012 and published in the previous hydrological yearbook due to the complex topography high altitude and inaccessibility of the qilian mountains only five national meteorological stations are located in the high altitude mountainous areas while the rest of the meteorological stations are located in the pre mountain and oasis plain areas data from five meteorological stations in the qms were selected for this study daily precipitation and temperature data for the period 1970 2019 were used to calculate trends of changes 2 3 methods 2 3 1 standardization to completely explore the effects of meteorological variables on flood frequency 12 temperature and precipitation indices were defined table 3 meteorological variables were standardised as follows to capture changes in temperature and precipitation 1 m i m i m e a n m i s d m i where mi is the meteorological indices for the year mean mi is the mean value of the meteorological indices and sd mi denotes the standard deviation of the meteorological indices mi 0 means that the meteorological indices are higher than the mean value and show an increasing trend and vice versa 2 3 2 test methods for trend analysis tests to detect significant trends in hydro meteorological time series are based on parametric or non parametric methods the linear regression estimator lr estimator is the most frequently applied method for trend analysis li et al 2008 the mann kendall m k trend test kendall 1975 mann 1945 is also recommended by the world meteorological organization and is extensively adopted to identify trends in hydrometeorological variables gocic and trajkovic 2013 hamed 2008 sang et al 2014 yang et al 2022 in this study we employed the lr estimator and m k trend test to explore trends in flooding and climate variables the m k trend test is calculated as follows 2 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i with 3 sgn x j x i 1 i f x j x i 0 0 i f x j x i 0 1 i f x j x i 0 a positive negative value of s represents an increasing decreasing trend when n 8 the statistic s is almost distributed normally and its mean e s and variance var s are determined as follows 4 e s 0 5 v ar s 1 18 n n 1 2 n 5 i 1 m t i t i 1 2 t i 5 where n is the number of data points m is the number of tied groups and t i is the number of data in the tied group the standardised normal test statistic z is computed as follows 6 z s 1 v a r s i f s 0 0 i f s 0 s 1 v a r s i f s 0 the null hypothesis i e no significant trend in hydrometeorological time series is rejected if the absolute value of z is greater than the theoretical value z 1 α 2 where α is the statistical significance level all trend results in this study were evaluated at significance levels of 90 95 and 99 2 3 3 calculation of flood return period the common methods for flood return period calculation include generalized extreme value gev distribution smith et al 2018 yang et al 2019 pearson type iii distribution milly et al 2002 yin et al 2015 and log logistic distribution shao et al 2004 etc the pot flood series in the arid and semi arid regions of northwest china under climate change are non stationary in the past decades based on theoretical and practical considerations the gev distribution is applicable and accurate for the calculation of hydrological extremes so after the goodness of fit test for the flood extremes series the gev distribution is chosen to calculate the flood return period 2 3 4 frequency analysis of pot flood series the flood samples of the pot model obey generalized pareto distribution durocher et al 2018 katz et al 2002 in order to make the assumption of independence of the extracted flood peaks acceptable the de clustering method proposed by lang et al 1999 was used while considering the pot sampling method that has been applied in arid and semi arid regions of northwest china jiang et al 2021 zhang et al 2016 in this study all extracted peaks respect the following two conditions in terms of the interarrival time d and the intermediate discharge q min 7 d 5 log a q min 3 4 min q 1 q 2 where d denotes the flood duration between two successive peaks a denotes the catchment area in km2 and q min denotes the minimum discharge between two successive peaks q 1 and q 2 in m3 s respectively according to the chinese hydrological information and forecasting specification gb t 22482 2008 flood levels are classified as follows small flood return period 5 years medium flood return period 5 20 years and large flood return period 20 years however for inland rivers in arid and semi arid regions the number of floods per year was less and the magnitude of floods was much smaller compared to those occurring in large rivers in humid regions in this study in order to comprehensively detect frequency trends for different flood levels in 12 rivers originating in qms under climate change floods with return periods 1 years were selected as pot floods to investigate flood frequency correlation analysis of linear trend was also conducted to estimate the regional trends for the 12 studied rivers 3 results 3 1 the threshold value for pot sampling method floods with return periods 1 years were identified as pot floods and the gev distribution was used to calculate the return periods of the pot flood series for 12 rivers the threshold determination of the pot sampling method will vary with the selection of different flood return periods in the case of the xiying river in the east the hei river in the central and the shule river in the west for example the flood peak discharge for a return period of 1 years were 60 8 m3 s 105 5 m3 s and 118 4 m3 s and the flood peak discharge increased as the return period increased e g the flood peak discharge corresponding to a return period of 20 years were 268 1 m3 s 487 5 m3 s and 625 8 m3 s however the pot floods events decreased and the temporal variation of the flood frequency series are shown in fig 2 according to the same evaluation method the threshold values of pot floods for the corresponding hydrological stations of the 12 rivers are shown in table 4 3 2 frequency trends for different flood levels the results of temporal trend analysis of the different pot number of events frequency series using the lr estimator and m k trend test are presented in fig 3 significant increasing and decreasing trends in the frequency of pot flood series were found to have occurred in the study period with 90 95 and 99 significance levels specifically an increase occurred in the frequency of total floods with a significance level of 90 this comprised an increase in the frequency of small floods and a decrease in the frequency of medium floods at the 95 significance level whereas an insignificant change in the frequency of large floods three main phases can be identified in the trends of total floods since 1970 from 1970 to 1987 there was a slight increase in flood frequency from 1988 to 2009 there was a decrease in flood frequency and after 2010 there was an increase in flood frequency the trends for small and medium floods are similar to those for all flood classifications combined whereas the trend for large floods is slightly different with a decrease in flood frequency from 5 0 times 10 years during 1970 1987 3 75 times 10 years during 1988 2019 3 3 frequency trends for different flood types the results of the flood type trend analysis and the percentage of each flood type are shown in fig 4 for the 12 studied rivers spring summer and autumn floods account for 15 4 79 7 and 4 9 of the total floods respectively spring and autumn floods showed decreasing frequency trends with significance levels of 99 and 95 whereas summer floods exhibited an increasing frequency trend with a significance level of 99 spring floods showed an increasing frequency trend from 1970 a decreasing frequency trend after 1990 an increasing trend after 2000 followed by another decreasing frequency trend after 2010 summer floods exhibited a continuously fluctuating increasing frequency trend from 1970 to 2019 in contrast autumn floods showed a decreasing frequency trend from 1970 to 1985 and increasing frequency trend until approximately 1995 and then a fluctuating decreasing frequency trend until 2019 3 4 decadal trends in flood levels and types fig 5 shows that the flood contains flood abundant normal and dry years in terms of flood size small floods showed the least variation with an increasing decreasing increasing trend from the 1970 s to the 2010 s the medium floods showed a decreasing trend from the 1970 s to the 2000 s and an increasing trend after 2010 the large floods exhibited a decreasing trend from the 1970 s to the 1980 s an increasing trend from the 1990 s to the 2000 s and a further decreasing trend after 2010 the large floods showed the greatest variability with a rate of variation of 90 in the 1970 s and about 50 in the 1980 s and 2010 s in terms of proportional analysis of flood types spring floods increased from the 1970 s to the 1980 s and decreased from the 1990 s to the 2010 s summer floods showed the least variation with a general increase overall from the 1970 s to the 2010 s autumn floods exhibited the greatest variation decreasing from the 1970 s to the 2010 s with a rate of variation of 120 in the 1970 s and 80 in the 2010 s 3 5 regional trends in frequencies of various flood levels and types the frequency trends for flood levels for the three main basins and a comparative analysis of regional variations in different flood levels are shown in fig 6 the changing climate led to both increasing and decreasing frequency trends in flood levels in the qm region from 1970 to 2019 in the syrb the frequency trends for small and large floods were nonsignificant whereas medium floods exhibited a decreasing frequency trend with a significance level of 99 in the hrb small floods exhibited an increasing frequency trend with a significance level of 95 but no significant frequency trends in medium or large floods were observed in contrast to the syrb and hrb small and medium floods in the slrb showed an increasing frequency trend with significance levels of 95 and 99 respectively no significant frequency trend was observed for large floods although various increasing and decreasing frequency trends were observed for small and medium floods in the three main basins no significant frequency trends were observed for large floods comparing the frequency of large floods before and after 1987 the frequency of large floods per decade was slightly increased in slrb while slightly decreased in syrb and hrb the trends in flood frequency for the various flood types in the three studied basins are shown in fig 7 variations were observed in the frequency of spring summer and autumn floods in the syrb hrb and slrb from 1970 to 2019 there were overall decreasing frequency trends for spring and autumn floods with significance levels of 90 and 95 for the syrb 99 and 95 for the hrb and overall decreasing frequency trends for both spring and autumn floods for the slrb with significance levels of 90 summer floods showed some variation with a nonsignificant frequency trend in the syrb and increasing frequency trends in the hrb and slrb both at a significance level of 99 4 discussion 4 1 possible attribution of flood frequency trends the observed changes in flood frequency indicate that flooding showed significant variation from east to west in the qms over the study period as shown in figs 3 7 changes in flood discharge since 1970 have been shown to be related to climate change in arid and semi arid areas of northwest china mao et al 2012 wang and qin 2017 the climate is changing from warm dry to warm wet in this region shi et al 2003 and a warmer climate may lead to high temperatures and heavy rainfall and glacial melting may cause changes in flooding cao et al 2014 gao et al 2011 tian et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 chen et al 2015 also found an increasing trend of temperature and precipitation in the arid northwest in the last 50 years with precipitation at a relatively stable stage from 1960 to 1986 while it began to increase sharply after 1987 and it is noteworthy that the increasing trend slowed down from 2000 to 2015 to better understand the meteorological factors affecting changes in flood frequency temperature and precipitation data from five meteorological stations were analysed by defining 12 temperature and precipitation indices figs 8 and 9 the results of the analysis of data from the five stations indicate an increasing trend in temperature and precipitation from 1970 to 2019 figs 8 and 9 generally the generation of floods is influenced by factors such as temperature precipitation and topography but in the high altitude areas of the qms precipitation is the dominant factor as the main cause of flood variability under the influence of temperature and precipitation evolution from 1970 to 2019 variations in increasing or decreasing flood frequency trends were observed for the various flood levels and types in the syrb hrb and slrb figs 3 7 according to fig 10 ap p1 and p5 were counted for five weather stations in three sub basins and the results showed that ap was increasing trend in the whole region and the increasing trend was more significant in the central and western than in the eastern region p1 and p5 also showed a slight decrease in the eastern wsl my meteorological stations and an increasing trend in the central ql yng meteorological stations and western tl meteorological station comparing the trends of flood frequency and precipitation ap p1 and p5 for the whole region and the three sub basins figs 3 7 10 the trends of small and medium floods are generally consistent with the trends of precipitation during the study period however large floods are theoretically generated by extreme precipitation but no obvious correspondence is found in the study area mainly because the available data from meteorological stations are too few to precisely quantify the process of precipitation and large flood generation similar results have been obtained for high latitude rivers in the tianshan mountains and the tarim river basin mao et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 notwithstanding the spatial heterogeneity of the observational records the changes in flood characteristics identified in our study are broadly consistent with the changing climate studies conducted in europe and north america have shown similar results such as a changing climate both increasing and decreasing the frequency of european river floods and warmer temperatures leading to earlier spring snowmelt floods bloeschl et al 2019 however studies conducted in canada have indicated that there is an increasing trend in flood frequency with the timescale varying across regions zadeh et al 2020 studies have indicated that increased precipitation has resulted in increased flooding in some areas while decreased precipitation and increased evaporation have led to decreased flooding in other areas bloeschl et al 2019 hodgkins et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 nevertheless changes in flood discharge in the context of climate change should be confirmed by a further study based on simulation in high altitude mountainous regions of the qms because no coherent large scale gauging dataset has been available due to the limited spatial coverage and number of meteorological and hydrological stations 4 2 differences in trends of different types of floods differences were observed between the trends in the frequency of the various flood series of the syrb hrb and slrb over different time periods with an important observation being that spring and autumn floods showed decreasing frequency trends and summer floods exhibited increasing frequency trends long term changes in flood frequency highlight the necessity of a better understanding of flood generation mechanisms in the qm region which may be obtained through testing the distributions of pot flood series flood are classified into seasonable types i e spring summer and autumn floods but these usually occur in high latitude alpine river areas spring floods are induced by snowmelt and occur in late april and may the april peak in flood frequency in northern china can be attributed to localized storms associated with mid latitude weather systems in northwest china or to snowmelt in high altitude regions gao et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 summer floods are caused by heavy rainfall and glacial meltwater table 5 and observed mainly in june july and august this rainfall frequently causes annual flood peaks and is the result of the influence of frontal systems or early onset of the east asian summer monsoon ding and chan 2005 autumn floods are triggered by snow and ice melt and rainstorms and generally occur in september chen et al 2015 found that temperature showed an accelerated increase at a rate of 0 517 c 10 year during 1960 2015 in northwest china and precipitation was relatively stable from 1960 to 1987 and increased significantly after 1987 moreover in the qms wang et al 2019a found that spring and autumn precipitation showed a weak increasing trend of 1 85 mm 10 year in 1960 2016 but summer precipitation was significantly increasing at 5 20 mm 10 year and summer precipitation was the main contributor to the increase in annual precipitation river floods originating in the qms can be influenced by many factors such as altitude topography and glacier size but increased summer precipitation and glacial meltwater due to anomalous warming in the context of climate change are the main reasons for increased summer flooding while weak changes in precipitation and lower soil moisture due to higher temperatures in spring and autumn are the probable reasons for reduced spring and autumn flooding figs 4 and 7 4 3 differences in trends of different regional floods the spatial distributions of the flood frequency series also differed with an increasing frequency trend and greater values in the western slrb and a decreasing frequency trend and smaller values for floods in the syrb and hrb as shown in figs 3 7 the syrb in the east is mainly influenced by the east asian monsoon the slrb in the west is mainly influenced by the westerly circulation while the hrb in the center is the confluence zone mainly influenced by the tibetan plateau monsoon and the above two together and the enhanced westerly circulation and increased water vapor are the main factors of the increased rainfall in qms chen et al 2018 wang et al 2019a the different climate types lead to different regional rainfall which affects the difference of flooding trends between east and west regions mountainous areas with greater precipitation and extensive glacier and snow cover have larger floods than plain areas that have lower precipitation and sparser vegetation jia et al 2014 zhao et al 2021 zhu and wang 1996 from 2005 2010 2684 glaciers were present in the qm region covering an area of 1597 81 70 30 km2 with a total ice volume of 84 48 km3 glaciers in the east of the region are retreating rapidly whereas those in central and western areas are retreating more slowly wang et al 2011 due to differences between the amounts of snow and number of glaciers and glacier area for the 12 rivers in the three main basins in the region the glacial meltwater runoff recharge rate is 10 in the syrb in the east 5 15 in the hrb in the central region and 30 in the slrb in the west table 5 gao et al 2011 liu et al 2021 sun et al 2018 significant temperature increases have caused glacial melting and significantly increased precipitation at the ql yng and tl meteorological stations figs 8 and 9 resulting in an increase in flood frequency figs 3 7 and hence the occurrence of extreme floods especially in the slrb in contrast in syrb and hrb the combination of increased temperature and precipitation fluctuations influenced by the westerly circulation the tibetan plateau monsoon and the east asian monsoon and the relatively small proportion of glacial meltwater table 5 leads to an increasing and decreasing trend in flood frequency nevertheless temperatures and precipitation have increased at different rates in the syrb hrb and slrb over the past 50 years figs 8 and 9 which is the main reasons for the differences in different levels and types of floods among the eastern and western regions of the qms figs 6 and 7 5 conclusions the trends in frequency of different flood levels and flood types under the influence of climate change in the qm region of northwest china were investigated using a linear regression estimator and m k trend tests the gev distribution method was adopted to estimate the flood quantiles for different return periods during the historical period and pot flood series were determined for each river the timings of floods from 1970 to 2019 were investigated to evaluate trends in flood seasonality under a warming climate the main conclusions are summarised as follows 1 pot flood events originating in the qm have complex causes and are affected by various factors as the temperature and precipitation in arid and semi arid areas of northwest china showed an increase after 1987 the main factors generating flooding in the qms are heavy rainfall abnormal warming and accelerated glacial melting 2 trend analysis for the pot flood series for the 12 studied rivers over the period 1970 2019 identified an increase in the frequency of total floods at the 90 significance level however there were differences between the frequency of various flood levels with an increasing frequency trend for small floods and a decreasing frequency trend for medium and large floods the spatial distribution of the pot flood series also varied the overall flood frequency in the syrb in the east of the region showed a decreasing trend flood frequency in the hrb in the central part of the region exhibited a significantly increasing trend for small floods but no significant trends for medium or large floods and flood frequency in the slrb in the west of the region showed significantly increasing trends for small and medium floods but a nonsignificant trend for large floods 3 the 12 rivers analysed in this study all originate from glaciers in the qm region and their upstream areas are pristine and unaffected by human activities according to our data analysis spring and autumn floods showed decreasing frequency trends and summer floods exhibited increasing frequency trends in the syrb hrb and slrb in the future research on the formation mechanism of extreme flood events should be strengthened especially to identify the impact of climate change and human activities the findings can propose more targeted adaptation to climate change recommendations and countermeasures credit

7919,study region the qilian mountains northwest china study focus trends in flood frequency and their driving factors must be analyzed to enable the effective management of water resources in the inland rivers originating in the qilian mountains qms based on hydrological station datasets from 12 typical rivers with annual maximum peak discharge and peaks over threshold pot flood series for the period 1970 2019 the spatial and temporal variations of flooding in 12 rivers were detected using a linear regression estimator and mann kendall trend tests new hydrological insights the results indicate that the frequency of pot floods in 12 rivers during 1970 2019 showed an increasing trend at the 90 significance level with an increasing trend for small floods and decreasing trends for medium and large floods flood levels varied from east to west across the region with an overall decreasing trend in the east an increase in small floods in the central rivers and significant increases in both small and medium floods in the west both temperature and precipitation increased after 1987 and summer precipitation was a significantly increased as a result pot floods in most rivers increased after the 1980 s and trends in flood frequency showed decreases in spring and autumn and an increase in summer the main causes of the changes in flood frequency were found to be heavy rainfall abnormal warming and accelerated glacial melting keywords trends flood frequency peaks over threshold climate change qilian mountains data availability statement meteorological data are collected by the national climate center of the china meteorological administration and available on http data cma cn under request flood data are collected by bureau of hydrology and water resources of gansu province china and available under request 1 introduction climate change dominated by global warming ipcc 2021 has become one of the most important environmental issues in the world today betts 2011 global climate change has led to temperature increases extreme weather frequent climatic events and induces accelerated hydrological cycles at global and continental scales zhang et al 2013 ziegler et al 2003 as such the effects of climate change have aroused great concern and substantial interest from governments and researchers worldwide murray and ebi 2012 river floods are one of the most destructive types of natural disasters catastrophic flooding of different types i e fluvial pluvial and coastal flooding has gained public awareness and caused increasingly severe events over the past few decades with an estimated average annual global cost of us 104 billion desai et al 2015 extreme flooding events are projected to increase with ongoing climate change urbanization and economic growth hallegatte et al 2013 hirabayashi et al 2013 there are growing concerns over river floods due to changes in the magnitude frequency and trends of flooding events at catchment continental or global scales recent studies have indicated that climate change has both increased in northwestern europe and decreased in medium and large catchments in southern europe the frequency of river flooding events bloeschl et al 2019 bloschl et al 2017 anthropogenic climate change was expected to increase flood risk through more frequent intense precipitation increased catchment wetness and sea level rise wilby and keenan 2012 studies have highlighted increasing changes in extreme flood events and future flood projections in the context of climate change indicating that their frequency of occurrence is likely to increase in the future archfield et al 2014 chen et al 2021 murray and ebi 2012 zadeh et al 2020 magnitude and frequency of floods across china has been projected to increase by varying degrees under 54 different warming scenarios gu et al 2021 kundzewicz et al 2019a liang et al 2019 and flood risk increased in several areas between 1961 and 2017 kundzewicz et al 2019b yang et al 2019 presented a characterization of flood hazards across china and indicated there has been a decrease in flood hazards in recent decades xiong et al 2020 proposed that the magnitude of the annual maximum peak discharge in the yangtze river has shown a decreasing trend since 1998 accompanied by periodic fluctuations in summer precipitation anomalies mao et al 2012 found there is a link between extreme flooding and climate change that has occurred in arid and semi arid regions of northwest china over the past 50 years such as in typical watersheds in the tianshan mountains and that extreme flooding events are increasing in different regions in xinjiang with southern xinjiang showing a significant increase zhang et al 2016 studied flooding in the tarim river basin particularly in high latitude rivers where they found that floods are mainly attributable to intense precipitation and glacial melting with rainstorm and temperature induced floods being dominant the impact of climate change on river floods remains an important area of research because of the complexities surrounding changes in precipitation underlying surface conditions and the hydrological cycle the qilian mountains qms are the source and runoff formation area of inland rivers in the hexi corridor which is a typical arid semi arid region in northwest china zhang et al 2015 the inland rivers that originate in the qms flow through the hexi corridor and disappear into the oases in the north nevertheless mountainous areas located at high altitudes of qms have special and typical flood generation mechanisms where heavy rainfall and melting ice and snow water due to temperature increase are the main factors generating floods understanding the trends in the frequency changes of floods in the context of climate change is important for understanding the patterns of water resources changes sustainable water resources management and environmental protection in northwest china chen et al 2021 although numerous studies have been conducted on hydrological factors in arid inland river basins in northwest china these studies have focused mainly on the impact of climate change on runoff li et al 2020 ma et al 2008 wang and qin 2017 and few studies have focused on the correlation between climate change and flood risk factors zhang et al 2016 most studies on flood risk factors under the influence of climate change have not been sufficiently comprehensive moreover the limited geographical source environmental complexity and length and quality of collated historical hydrological data for arid and semi arid inland river basins have greatly limited our understanding of the impacts of climate change on flooding as the temperature and precipitation in northwest china showed an increase after 1987 chen et al 2015 the effects of such changes on river floods in the region remains unknown in this study we comprehensively assessed the impact of the changing climate on flood frequency in the qms using hydrological data and meteorological records for the period 1970 2019 the main objectives of our study were 1 to evaluate the spatial and temporal distributions of peaks over threshold pot flood series 2 to ascertain the trends of different levels and types of pot flood series at different temporal and regional scales and 3 to explore the driving factors of changes in flood frequency including the relationship between meteorological factors and flood characteristics 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the qms are located in the geographical boundary of about 93 4 103 4 e and 35 8 40 0 n across the northeast qinghai tibetan plateau and northwest china and extend 800 km from northwest to southeast and 200 km from south to north wang et al 2019b the hexi corridor inland region 92 4 104 2 e 37 3 42 3 n is located in the north of the qm region with a total area of 2 15 105 km2 the qm region is composed of several parallel mountain belts and wide valleys orient northwest to southeast the elevation of the region ranges from 3000 to 5000 m with most peaks exceeding 4000 m wang et al 2019b snow cover is typically present all year round on the mountains above 4000 m and glaciers are more abundant in the west than in the east cao et al 2014 gao et al 2011 tian et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 the climate shows substantial variation with altitude and most precipitation events in high mountain areas are influenced by three main sources of water vapor i e westerly flow the east asian monsoon and the tibetan plateau monsoon zhang et al 2008 the qms are the runoff formation area and source of several major rivers and the region has a mean annual rainfall of 301 9 mm wang et al 2019a in this study we selected 12 rivers fig 1 that originate from the qms and terminate in the northern oasis of the hexi corridor the rivers are distributed across three main basins from east to west i e the shiyang river basin syrb the hei river basin hrb and the shule river basin slrb respectively the characteristics of these rivers are listed in table 1 2 2 data twelve rivers originating from the qms were selected for analysis of trends in flood frequency fig 1 table 1 these rivers were pristine and almost free from human influence the dataset used in this paper was compiled from climate data and historical flood discharge data climate data were obtained from the national meteorological centre of the china meteorological administration and flood discharge data were collected from the bureau of hydrology and water resources of gansu province general flood information is shown in table 1 and information on the meteorological stations in the qms is given in table 2 our analysis was based on a series of observations of annual maximum peak discharge and pot flood series from 12 hydrological stations with continuous records over the period 1970 2019 i e three stations in the syrb six stations in the hrb and three stations in the slrb there are considerable variations in the spatial scales of the representative river basins with a large percentage 78 of the stations representing small and medium sized river basins drainage areas 5000 km2 table 1 the data have been subject to strict quality control procedures to ensure data consistency and accuracy by following the procedure for hydrological data compilation of china sl247 2012 and published in the previous hydrological yearbook due to the complex topography high altitude and inaccessibility of the qilian mountains only five national meteorological stations are located in the high altitude mountainous areas while the rest of the meteorological stations are located in the pre mountain and oasis plain areas data from five meteorological stations in the qms were selected for this study daily precipitation and temperature data for the period 1970 2019 were used to calculate trends of changes 2 3 methods 2 3 1 standardization to completely explore the effects of meteorological variables on flood frequency 12 temperature and precipitation indices were defined table 3 meteorological variables were standardised as follows to capture changes in temperature and precipitation 1 m i m i m e a n m i s d m i where mi is the meteorological indices for the year mean mi is the mean value of the meteorological indices and sd mi denotes the standard deviation of the meteorological indices mi 0 means that the meteorological indices are higher than the mean value and show an increasing trend and vice versa 2 3 2 test methods for trend analysis tests to detect significant trends in hydro meteorological time series are based on parametric or non parametric methods the linear regression estimator lr estimator is the most frequently applied method for trend analysis li et al 2008 the mann kendall m k trend test kendall 1975 mann 1945 is also recommended by the world meteorological organization and is extensively adopted to identify trends in hydrometeorological variables gocic and trajkovic 2013 hamed 2008 sang et al 2014 yang et al 2022 in this study we employed the lr estimator and m k trend test to explore trends in flooding and climate variables the m k trend test is calculated as follows 2 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n sgn x j x i with 3 sgn x j x i 1 i f x j x i 0 0 i f x j x i 0 1 i f x j x i 0 a positive negative value of s represents an increasing decreasing trend when n 8 the statistic s is almost distributed normally and its mean e s and variance var s are determined as follows 4 e s 0 5 v ar s 1 18 n n 1 2 n 5 i 1 m t i t i 1 2 t i 5 where n is the number of data points m is the number of tied groups and t i is the number of data in the tied group the standardised normal test statistic z is computed as follows 6 z s 1 v a r s i f s 0 0 i f s 0 s 1 v a r s i f s 0 the null hypothesis i e no significant trend in hydrometeorological time series is rejected if the absolute value of z is greater than the theoretical value z 1 α 2 where α is the statistical significance level all trend results in this study were evaluated at significance levels of 90 95 and 99 2 3 3 calculation of flood return period the common methods for flood return period calculation include generalized extreme value gev distribution smith et al 2018 yang et al 2019 pearson type iii distribution milly et al 2002 yin et al 2015 and log logistic distribution shao et al 2004 etc the pot flood series in the arid and semi arid regions of northwest china under climate change are non stationary in the past decades based on theoretical and practical considerations the gev distribution is applicable and accurate for the calculation of hydrological extremes so after the goodness of fit test for the flood extremes series the gev distribution is chosen to calculate the flood return period 2 3 4 frequency analysis of pot flood series the flood samples of the pot model obey generalized pareto distribution durocher et al 2018 katz et al 2002 in order to make the assumption of independence of the extracted flood peaks acceptable the de clustering method proposed by lang et al 1999 was used while considering the pot sampling method that has been applied in arid and semi arid regions of northwest china jiang et al 2021 zhang et al 2016 in this study all extracted peaks respect the following two conditions in terms of the interarrival time d and the intermediate discharge q min 7 d 5 log a q min 3 4 min q 1 q 2 where d denotes the flood duration between two successive peaks a denotes the catchment area in km2 and q min denotes the minimum discharge between two successive peaks q 1 and q 2 in m3 s respectively according to the chinese hydrological information and forecasting specification gb t 22482 2008 flood levels are classified as follows small flood return period 5 years medium flood return period 5 20 years and large flood return period 20 years however for inland rivers in arid and semi arid regions the number of floods per year was less and the magnitude of floods was much smaller compared to those occurring in large rivers in humid regions in this study in order to comprehensively detect frequency trends for different flood levels in 12 rivers originating in qms under climate change floods with return periods 1 years were selected as pot floods to investigate flood frequency correlation analysis of linear trend was also conducted to estimate the regional trends for the 12 studied rivers 3 results 3 1 the threshold value for pot sampling method floods with return periods 1 years were identified as pot floods and the gev distribution was used to calculate the return periods of the pot flood series for 12 rivers the threshold determination of the pot sampling method will vary with the selection of different flood return periods in the case of the xiying river in the east the hei river in the central and the shule river in the west for example the flood peak discharge for a return period of 1 years were 60 8 m3 s 105 5 m3 s and 118 4 m3 s and the flood peak discharge increased as the return period increased e g the flood peak discharge corresponding to a return period of 20 years were 268 1 m3 s 487 5 m3 s and 625 8 m3 s however the pot floods events decreased and the temporal variation of the flood frequency series are shown in fig 2 according to the same evaluation method the threshold values of pot floods for the corresponding hydrological stations of the 12 rivers are shown in table 4 3 2 frequency trends for different flood levels the results of temporal trend analysis of the different pot number of events frequency series using the lr estimator and m k trend test are presented in fig 3 significant increasing and decreasing trends in the frequency of pot flood series were found to have occurred in the study period with 90 95 and 99 significance levels specifically an increase occurred in the frequency of total floods with a significance level of 90 this comprised an increase in the frequency of small floods and a decrease in the frequency of medium floods at the 95 significance level whereas an insignificant change in the frequency of large floods three main phases can be identified in the trends of total floods since 1970 from 1970 to 1987 there was a slight increase in flood frequency from 1988 to 2009 there was a decrease in flood frequency and after 2010 there was an increase in flood frequency the trends for small and medium floods are similar to those for all flood classifications combined whereas the trend for large floods is slightly different with a decrease in flood frequency from 5 0 times 10 years during 1970 1987 3 75 times 10 years during 1988 2019 3 3 frequency trends for different flood types the results of the flood type trend analysis and the percentage of each flood type are shown in fig 4 for the 12 studied rivers spring summer and autumn floods account for 15 4 79 7 and 4 9 of the total floods respectively spring and autumn floods showed decreasing frequency trends with significance levels of 99 and 95 whereas summer floods exhibited an increasing frequency trend with a significance level of 99 spring floods showed an increasing frequency trend from 1970 a decreasing frequency trend after 1990 an increasing trend after 2000 followed by another decreasing frequency trend after 2010 summer floods exhibited a continuously fluctuating increasing frequency trend from 1970 to 2019 in contrast autumn floods showed a decreasing frequency trend from 1970 to 1985 and increasing frequency trend until approximately 1995 and then a fluctuating decreasing frequency trend until 2019 3 4 decadal trends in flood levels and types fig 5 shows that the flood contains flood abundant normal and dry years in terms of flood size small floods showed the least variation with an increasing decreasing increasing trend from the 1970 s to the 2010 s the medium floods showed a decreasing trend from the 1970 s to the 2000 s and an increasing trend after 2010 the large floods exhibited a decreasing trend from the 1970 s to the 1980 s an increasing trend from the 1990 s to the 2000 s and a further decreasing trend after 2010 the large floods showed the greatest variability with a rate of variation of 90 in the 1970 s and about 50 in the 1980 s and 2010 s in terms of proportional analysis of flood types spring floods increased from the 1970 s to the 1980 s and decreased from the 1990 s to the 2010 s summer floods showed the least variation with a general increase overall from the 1970 s to the 2010 s autumn floods exhibited the greatest variation decreasing from the 1970 s to the 2010 s with a rate of variation of 120 in the 1970 s and 80 in the 2010 s 3 5 regional trends in frequencies of various flood levels and types the frequency trends for flood levels for the three main basins and a comparative analysis of regional variations in different flood levels are shown in fig 6 the changing climate led to both increasing and decreasing frequency trends in flood levels in the qm region from 1970 to 2019 in the syrb the frequency trends for small and large floods were nonsignificant whereas medium floods exhibited a decreasing frequency trend with a significance level of 99 in the hrb small floods exhibited an increasing frequency trend with a significance level of 95 but no significant frequency trends in medium or large floods were observed in contrast to the syrb and hrb small and medium floods in the slrb showed an increasing frequency trend with significance levels of 95 and 99 respectively no significant frequency trend was observed for large floods although various increasing and decreasing frequency trends were observed for small and medium floods in the three main basins no significant frequency trends were observed for large floods comparing the frequency of large floods before and after 1987 the frequency of large floods per decade was slightly increased in slrb while slightly decreased in syrb and hrb the trends in flood frequency for the various flood types in the three studied basins are shown in fig 7 variations were observed in the frequency of spring summer and autumn floods in the syrb hrb and slrb from 1970 to 2019 there were overall decreasing frequency trends for spring and autumn floods with significance levels of 90 and 95 for the syrb 99 and 95 for the hrb and overall decreasing frequency trends for both spring and autumn floods for the slrb with significance levels of 90 summer floods showed some variation with a nonsignificant frequency trend in the syrb and increasing frequency trends in the hrb and slrb both at a significance level of 99 4 discussion 4 1 possible attribution of flood frequency trends the observed changes in flood frequency indicate that flooding showed significant variation from east to west in the qms over the study period as shown in figs 3 7 changes in flood discharge since 1970 have been shown to be related to climate change in arid and semi arid areas of northwest china mao et al 2012 wang and qin 2017 the climate is changing from warm dry to warm wet in this region shi et al 2003 and a warmer climate may lead to high temperatures and heavy rainfall and glacial melting may cause changes in flooding cao et al 2014 gao et al 2011 tian et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 chen et al 2015 also found an increasing trend of temperature and precipitation in the arid northwest in the last 50 years with precipitation at a relatively stable stage from 1960 to 1986 while it began to increase sharply after 1987 and it is noteworthy that the increasing trend slowed down from 2000 to 2015 to better understand the meteorological factors affecting changes in flood frequency temperature and precipitation data from five meteorological stations were analysed by defining 12 temperature and precipitation indices figs 8 and 9 the results of the analysis of data from the five stations indicate an increasing trend in temperature and precipitation from 1970 to 2019 figs 8 and 9 generally the generation of floods is influenced by factors such as temperature precipitation and topography but in the high altitude areas of the qms precipitation is the dominant factor as the main cause of flood variability under the influence of temperature and precipitation evolution from 1970 to 2019 variations in increasing or decreasing flood frequency trends were observed for the various flood levels and types in the syrb hrb and slrb figs 3 7 according to fig 10 ap p1 and p5 were counted for five weather stations in three sub basins and the results showed that ap was increasing trend in the whole region and the increasing trend was more significant in the central and western than in the eastern region p1 and p5 also showed a slight decrease in the eastern wsl my meteorological stations and an increasing trend in the central ql yng meteorological stations and western tl meteorological station comparing the trends of flood frequency and precipitation ap p1 and p5 for the whole region and the three sub basins figs 3 7 10 the trends of small and medium floods are generally consistent with the trends of precipitation during the study period however large floods are theoretically generated by extreme precipitation but no obvious correspondence is found in the study area mainly because the available data from meteorological stations are too few to precisely quantify the process of precipitation and large flood generation similar results have been obtained for high latitude rivers in the tianshan mountains and the tarim river basin mao et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 notwithstanding the spatial heterogeneity of the observational records the changes in flood characteristics identified in our study are broadly consistent with the changing climate studies conducted in europe and north america have shown similar results such as a changing climate both increasing and decreasing the frequency of european river floods and warmer temperatures leading to earlier spring snowmelt floods bloeschl et al 2019 however studies conducted in canada have indicated that there is an increasing trend in flood frequency with the timescale varying across regions zadeh et al 2020 studies have indicated that increased precipitation has resulted in increased flooding in some areas while decreased precipitation and increased evaporation have led to decreased flooding in other areas bloeschl et al 2019 hodgkins et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 nevertheless changes in flood discharge in the context of climate change should be confirmed by a further study based on simulation in high altitude mountainous regions of the qms because no coherent large scale gauging dataset has been available due to the limited spatial coverage and number of meteorological and hydrological stations 4 2 differences in trends of different types of floods differences were observed between the trends in the frequency of the various flood series of the syrb hrb and slrb over different time periods with an important observation being that spring and autumn floods showed decreasing frequency trends and summer floods exhibited increasing frequency trends long term changes in flood frequency highlight the necessity of a better understanding of flood generation mechanisms in the qm region which may be obtained through testing the distributions of pot flood series flood are classified into seasonable types i e spring summer and autumn floods but these usually occur in high latitude alpine river areas spring floods are induced by snowmelt and occur in late april and may the april peak in flood frequency in northern china can be attributed to localized storms associated with mid latitude weather systems in northwest china or to snowmelt in high altitude regions gao et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 summer floods are caused by heavy rainfall and glacial meltwater table 5 and observed mainly in june july and august this rainfall frequently causes annual flood peaks and is the result of the influence of frontal systems or early onset of the east asian summer monsoon ding and chan 2005 autumn floods are triggered by snow and ice melt and rainstorms and generally occur in september chen et al 2015 found that temperature showed an accelerated increase at a rate of 0 517 c 10 year during 1960 2015 in northwest china and precipitation was relatively stable from 1960 to 1987 and increased significantly after 1987 moreover in the qms wang et al 2019a found that spring and autumn precipitation showed a weak increasing trend of 1 85 mm 10 year in 1960 2016 but summer precipitation was significantly increasing at 5 20 mm 10 year and summer precipitation was the main contributor to the increase in annual precipitation river floods originating in the qms can be influenced by many factors such as altitude topography and glacier size but increased summer precipitation and glacial meltwater due to anomalous warming in the context of climate change are the main reasons for increased summer flooding while weak changes in precipitation and lower soil moisture due to higher temperatures in spring and autumn are the probable reasons for reduced spring and autumn flooding figs 4 and 7 4 3 differences in trends of different regional floods the spatial distributions of the flood frequency series also differed with an increasing frequency trend and greater values in the western slrb and a decreasing frequency trend and smaller values for floods in the syrb and hrb as shown in figs 3 7 the syrb in the east is mainly influenced by the east asian monsoon the slrb in the west is mainly influenced by the westerly circulation while the hrb in the center is the confluence zone mainly influenced by the tibetan plateau monsoon and the above two together and the enhanced westerly circulation and increased water vapor are the main factors of the increased rainfall in qms chen et al 2018 wang et al 2019a the different climate types lead to different regional rainfall which affects the difference of flooding trends between east and west regions mountainous areas with greater precipitation and extensive glacier and snow cover have larger floods than plain areas that have lower precipitation and sparser vegetation jia et al 2014 zhao et al 2021 zhu and wang 1996 from 2005 2010 2684 glaciers were present in the qm region covering an area of 1597 81 70 30 km2 with a total ice volume of 84 48 km3 glaciers in the east of the region are retreating rapidly whereas those in central and western areas are retreating more slowly wang et al 2011 due to differences between the amounts of snow and number of glaciers and glacier area for the 12 rivers in the three main basins in the region the glacial meltwater runoff recharge rate is 10 in the syrb in the east 5 15 in the hrb in the central region and 30 in the slrb in the west table 5 gao et al 2011 liu et al 2021 sun et al 2018 significant temperature increases have caused glacial melting and significantly increased precipitation at the ql yng and tl meteorological stations figs 8 and 9 resulting in an increase in flood frequency figs 3 7 and hence the occurrence of extreme floods especially in the slrb in contrast in syrb and hrb the combination of increased temperature and precipitation fluctuations influenced by the westerly circulation the tibetan plateau monsoon and the east asian monsoon and the relatively small proportion of glacial meltwater table 5 leads to an increasing and decreasing trend in flood frequency nevertheless temperatures and precipitation have increased at different rates in the syrb hrb and slrb over the past 50 years figs 8 and 9 which is the main reasons for the differences in different levels and types of floods among the eastern and western regions of the qms figs 6 and 7 5 conclusions the trends in frequency of different flood levels and flood types under the influence of climate change in the qm region of northwest china were investigated using a linear regression estimator and m k trend tests the gev distribution method was adopted to estimate the flood quantiles for different return periods during the historical period and pot flood series were determined for each river the timings of floods from 1970 to 2019 were investigated to evaluate trends in flood seasonality under a warming climate the main conclusions are summarised as follows 1 pot flood events originating in the qm have complex causes and are affected by various factors as the temperature and precipitation in arid and semi arid areas of northwest china showed an increase after 1987 the main factors generating flooding in the qms are heavy rainfall abnormal warming and accelerated glacial melting 2 trend analysis for the pot flood series for the 12 studied rivers over the period 1970 2019 identified an increase in the frequency of total floods at the 90 significance level however there were differences between the frequency of various flood levels with an increasing frequency trend for small floods and a decreasing frequency trend for medium and large floods the spatial distribution of the pot flood series also varied the overall flood frequency in the syrb in the east of the region showed a decreasing trend flood frequency in the hrb in the central part of the region exhibited a significantly increasing trend for small floods but no significant trends for medium or large floods and flood frequency in the slrb in the west of the region showed significantly increasing trends for small and medium floods but a nonsignificant trend for large floods 3 the 12 rivers analysed in this study all originate from glaciers in the qm region and their upstream areas are pristine and unaffected by human activities according to our data analysis spring and autumn floods showed decreasing frequency trends and summer floods exhibited increasing frequency trends in the syrb hrb and slrb in the future research on the formation mechanism of extreme flood events should be strengthened especially to identify the impact of climate change and human activities the findings can propose more targeted adaptation to climate change recommendations and countermeasures credit
