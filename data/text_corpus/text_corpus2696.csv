results showed that the nutrient removal efficiency remained stable even though do was extremely low nevertheless phosphorus removal performance was found to deteriorate as side stream ratio increased to 1 3 at do 0 2 mg l 1 suggesting that extracting a higher ratio of supernatant was not favorable for phosphorus removal in the mainstream process at ultra low do the stoichiometric ratios of prelease hacuptake during anaerobic phase which decreased from 0 125 to 0 020 p mol c mol as do decreased with increasing side stream ratio were lower than that of typical pao metabolism it was very likely that the metabolic mode of paos changed due to long term deprivation of phosphate consequently the mainstream ebpr system failed to remove phosphorus efficiently it was also observed that phosphorus recovery efficiency was considerable at do 0 6 mg l 1 coupled with high side stream ratio therefore it was feasible and energy saving to extract appropriate ratio of anaerobic supernatant

phosphorus is one of the essential elements in life 1 2 nowadays people s daily use of detergents food additives semiconductor materials fertilizers and other necessities are involved in phosphorus with the increasing demand for phosphorus the reserves of phosphate ore are greatly reduced 3 4 it was estimated that phosphate ore on earth would be depleted in 100 years at the current mining rate without phosphorus recycling 5 8 in addition in the natural cycle of phosphorus phosphate resources are transferred from land to ocean in one direction statistically about 1 5 of the phosphorus in phosphate ore ends up in wastewater as a result approximately 10 20 of the total global phosphorus demand could be satisfied if the phosphorus was recovered from municipal wastewater 9 on the other

it is difficult to ensure the effluent quality meeting the discharge standard side stream phosphorus recovery technology is to extract supernatant from an ebpr system by a certain proportion at the end of the anaerobic phase and make it undergo a chemical precipitation by adding some agents finally the soluble phosphate crystals generated is discharged from the system in the form of pure chemical sludge 16 18 in this process both relatively efficient phosphorus recovery from point source pollution and the ratio of cod to p c p of the mainstream system increase are acquired to some

municipal wastewater according to the study of mayer et al intermittent extraction of phosphate rich supernatant or continuous extraction within 2 5 sludge retention time srt had the advantage of obtaining larger amount and higher purity of phosphorus recovery product moreover both efficient phosphorus recovery and stable phosphorus removal could be achieved 19 furthermore dissolved oxygen do concentration is an important factor influencing the operation of activated sludge process 21 23 in ebpr system aeration is the largest energy consuming unit it costs for more than 50 of the total operating expenditure of municipal wastewater treatment plant however excessive aeration commonly exists in wastewater treatment plants resulting in energy waste and system failure 24 in the light of the result from liu wang energy consumption could be reduced by approximately 10 as wastewater treatment plant was operated stably under low do 25 previous study also showed that polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos still displayed an excellent phosphorus releasing and uptaking capacity under low do conditions 26 therefore both environmental and economic benefits could be achieved if do controlled at a low level and phosphorus resource recovered simultaneously so far however few studies have reported the impact of long term low do coupled with side stream extraction on the performance of the mainstream process in view of the above reasons a low consumption ebpr system with anaerobic side stream phosphorus recovery strategy was developed to explore the effect of dissolved oxygen and anaerobic supernatant extracting ratio on biological nutrient removal performance and phosphorus recovery efficiency of the system in this study various effluent indicators of mainstream ebpr and the corresponding phosphorus recovery rates of side stream system under different low dissolved oxygen do 1 0 0 6 0 2 mg l 1 and extracting ratio m 0 1 4 1 3 1 2 were evaluated also the feasibility of long term phosphorus recovery combined with high efficiency ebpr under low do consumption was investigated for the purpose of providing theoretical basis and technical support for the implementation of side stream phosphorus recovery in practical municipal wastewater treatment plants and realizing economic and the environmental benefits 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor set up and operation all the experiments were conducted in an alternating anaerobic oxic an o sequencing batch reactor sbr performing enhancing biological phosphorus removal the sbr with working volume of 5 4 l was operated with a cycle of 8 h at temperature 16 0 5 each cycle consisted of 2 h anaerobic phase and 5 h aerobic phase followed by 50 min settling and 10 min decanting phase nearly the end of anaerobic phase sludge was settled down for 15 min after anaerobic phosphorus release then the phosphate rich supernatant was extracted by the peristaltic pump from the sbr to chemical precipitation tank by a certain ratio m 0 1 4 1 3 1 2 of the influent for phosphorus recovery in the side stream chemical precipitation tank mgcl2 6h2o was added as magnesium source for chemical precipitation to produce magnesium ammonium phosphate mgnh4po4 6h2o struvite considering the adequacy of the crystallized ions the actual molar ratio of mg2 and po4 3 in this study was 1 2 1 which was larger than the theoretical value 1 1 the ph of side stream tank was adjusted to 8 5 9 5 with 1 0 mol l 1 naoh to promote the formation of phosphorus recovery products after chemical precipitation the supernatant was discharged directly during aerobic period air was delivered intermittently using an on off control system to keep the do level at 1 0 0 6 and 0 2 mg l 1 respectively after settling period clarified supernatant was discharged and1 8 l synthetic wastewater was pumped into the reactor at the beginning of next cycle resulting in a hydraulic retention time hrt of 24 h the schematic diagram of the process was shown in fig 1 the sludge retention time srt was maintained at approximately 10 days by withdrawing a small portion of mixed liquor from the reactor at the end of the aerobic phase the experimental approach of the reactor was shown in table 1 2 2 sludge and wastewater the sbr was seeded with sludge from anning qilihe municipal wastewater treatment plant lanzhou china which showed a stable nitrogen and phosphorus removal performance with anaerobic anoxic oxic a2 o process the synthetic wastewater was prepared to have chemical oxygen demand cod nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations of 400 mg cod l 513 mg ch3coona 40 mg nh4 n l 153 mg nh4cl and 8 mg po4 3 p l 35 mg kh2po4 respectively concentrate 1 l was composed of 80 g mgcl2 6h2o 45 g mgso4 7h2o 21 g

1 ml trace element solution were added to 1 l of synthetic wastewater 2 3 sampling and analytical methods the effluent and the activated sludge from the sbr were sampled for chemical analysis and concentration measurement when the sbr operation reached a steady state a track analysis of an entire cycle was carried out the mixture liquor of samples 8 ml was withdrawn from the reactor during the operating cycle at some special points such as the beginning and the end of the feeding the end of anaerobic or aerobic phase and the beginning of effluent discharge once the sample was withdrawn from the reactor it was immediately centrifuged at 3000 r min for 2 min and filtered through a 0 45 μm filter paper the concentrations of soluble inorganic phosphate cod ammonia nh4 n nitrite no2 n nitrate no3 n total nitrogen tn mixed liquid suspended solids mlss and volatile suspended solids vss were analyzed according to the standard methods of apha 27 acetate was regularly monitored by a shimadzu high performance liquid chromatography kyoto japan equipped with an alltech previal organic acid column temperature do and ph were monitored using on line probes wtw multi 3420 germany respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 nutrient removal performance of the mainstream ebpr under different operating conditions in this study the side stream precipitation reaction and the mainstream phosphorus removal were two independent and interrelated processes in the matter of reaction itself chemical precipitation and biological reaction occurred in different system and were independent of each other however side stream extraction deprived phosphorus from the mainstream system thus the phosphate level in supernatant as well as the subsequent phosphorus recovery efficiency depended on the anaerobic phosphorus releasing performance of the mainstream ebpr as a result interaction occurred between side stream extraction and phosphorus removal performance in the mainstream system from fig 2 it was shown that cod could be removed steadily in the mainstream ebpr system throughout this experiment the average removal rates of cod were all higher than 92 in each run the extraction of anaerobic supernatant for phosphate recovery and long term low do had little effect on the removal of cod which was similar to the results of lv yuan 17 and ma et al 28 the reason why cod removal efficiency remained high was that organic substances were mainly removed during anaerobic phase in which influent volatile fatty acids vfas was uptaken by paos and synthesized in the form of polyhydroxyalkanoates phas thus subsequent side stream phosphorus recovery operation had little impact on the utilization of organic matter by microorganisms in the mainstream ebpr system do concentration hardly influenced on cod removal according to dong et al 29 similarly even if anaerobic supernatant under the ultra low do concentration condition do 0 2 mg l 1 was extracted cod removal performance of the mainstream ebpr system in this study remained a high level it could also be seen from fig 2 that total nitrogen tn removal efficiency slightly decreased continuously with the increase of side stream ratio in the same run under the same side stream ratio however lower do was more conducive to remove tn therefore tn removal gradually improved with the decrease of do and the average removal rate rose from 70 9 in run 1 to 77 8 in run 3 besides nh4 n removal performance in fig 2 showed that the average concentrations of effluent nh4 n in the three runs were 0 8 3 5 and 3 3 mg l 1 respectively even though the experimental temperature was kept at about 16 the removal of nh4 n decreased slightly with the decrease of do and the increase of side stream extraction frequency however effluent nh4 n stably met the requirement of level a class i in the national discharge standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plant gb18918 2002 china all the time this result was different from the observation of barat van loosdrecht that effluent nh4 n increased significantly when the side stream ratio reached a certain value about 40 30 meanwhile effluent no3 n concentrations declined with the decrease of do and the mean effluent no3 n in run 1 run 2 and run 3 were 10 9 7 9 and 5 2 mg l 1 respectively effluent no3 n was composed of two parts i e the residual of denitrification during anaerobic phase and the amount generated from nitrification during aerobic phase during anaerobic phase excessive carbon source was employed for denitrifying the residual no3 n in previous cycle since phosphorus release capacity by paos weakened and less cod was needed with do decreasing similar to the results of luo et al 31 the amount of phosphate available by paos in the subsequent aerobic phase reduced due to phosphorus recovery operation resulting in more carbon source consumed by denitrifying bacteria instead of paos in the next anaerobic phase in this way denitrifying bacteria gradually was enriched and denitrification was enhanced moreover extremely low do provided an ideal environment for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd during aerobic phase according to the findings of gogina gulshin 32 optimal environment for snd process was provided when do content was lower than 0 5 mg l 1 therefore tn removal performance of the mainstream system was further improved in this study it was also found that the removal performance of tn decreased with the increase of side stream ratio under the same do condition however side stream extraction had a less impact on tn removal compared with do phosphorus removal performance of the mainstream ebpr was also displayed in fig 2 phosphorus removal rates in run 1 and run 2 only fluctuated at the beginning days after changing side stream ratio and then restored gradually both average phosphorus removal rates in run 1 and run 2 were above 90 phosphorus was almost completely removed previous study suggested phosphorus recovery from anaerobic supernatant was beneficial and stimulated the removal of phosphorus to a certain degree 33 nevertheless the most remarkable deterioration of phosphorus removal was found in stage ⅲ3 and ⅳ3 of run 3 the lowest phosphorus removal rate was 59 8 and no recovery was observed during the following experimental period implying that the combination of ultra low do do 0 2 mg l 1 and high side stream ratio m 1 3 1 2 had a certain effect on the performance of phosphorus removal in the mainstream ebpr system 3 2 phosphorus release and uptake capability of ebpr system under different operation conditions to further understand the influence of do and side stream ratio on the phosphorus removal performance of the mainstream ebpr system phosphate release and uptake performance under different operation conditions were evaluated the results were shown in fig 3 from fig 3 phosphate released and uptaken decreased gradually with the increase of side stream ratio under the same do condition the average phosphate released amounts at each side stream ratio of run 1 were 32 8 26 0 22 1 and 18 7 mg l 1 respectively similarly the average amounts were 31 0 24 6 17 9 and 16 0 mg l 1 respectively in run 2 and were 26 5 20 9 15 5 and 6 47 mg l 1 respectively in run 3 the typical profiles of do and po4 3 concentrations during the operating cycles could be seen in fig s1 anaerobic phosphate release rate was an effective indicator of ebpr 34 phosphate released gradually decreased with decreasing do at the same side stream ratio and phosphate uptake time required during aerobic phase was gradually extended especially in stage ⅳ3 phosphate released was as low as 6 47 mg l 1 while residual phosphate was detected at the end of aerobic phase and phosphate uptake rate was lower than that reported in the study of lópez vázquez et al 35 this result was consistent with phosphorus removal effect in fig 2 it was shown that phosphate release activity of paos gradually decreased with the increase of side stream ratio in the case of ultra low do thus side stream phosphorus recovery strategy under ultra low do was not advised to be implemented due to weak biological phosphorus removal performance in the mainstream system under do 0 2 mg l 1 this was different from the results reported by chen et al that better phosphate release and uptake capability could be achieved at lower do levels 24 this difference could be attributed to the decrease of microbial activity caused by long term side stream deprivation of phosphorus under ultra low do in this study compared to the lower do condition do 0 5 mg l 1 in the study of chen et al still phosphate could be almost completely removed in the three runs except for stage iii3 and ⅳ3 in this study the capacity of phosphate release and uptake decreased with the increase of side stream ratio demonstrating that side stream chemical phosphorus recovery had an inhibitory effect on phosphorus removal performance in the mainstream system on one hand do of the ebpr system was maintained at a low level for a long time resulting in a relatively slow microbial metabolism in the system 36 on the other hand extracting anaerobic phosphate rich supernatant was a kind of phosphorus deprivation for the mainstream system if phosphorus in the activated sludge system was introduced into the side stream for chemical phosphorus precipitation insufficient phosphorus was available in the biological phosphorus removal system 37 consequently phosphate uptake by the sludge was affected during aerobic phase resulting in reducing poly p content in the biomass thus phosphorus removal function of the system weakened based on the previous study 38 excessive extraction of phosphorus might lead to the depletion of poly p in biomass which was an important energy source for paos and an indicator of the performance of ebpr system while poly p depletion could result in the proliferation of glycogen accumulating organisms gaos and competition for carbon source with paos which caused failure of the ebpr system 34 39 41 so as to further investigate the reasons for the deterioration of phosphorus removal in the mainstream ebpr system during stage ⅲ3 and ⅳ3 from the aspect of microorganisms metabolism stoichiometric ratios of phosphate release amount to hac uptake amount prelease hacuptake during anaerobic phase in typical cycles under different operating conditions were analyzed in fig 4 the ratio of prelease hacuptake was applied to indicate the activities of paos and gaos in mixed pao gao cultures at a given ph 34 42 43 fig 4 showed that prelease hacuptake decreased not only with the increase of side stream ratio but with the decrease of do which was similar to the observations by lv et al 44 and acevedo et al 45 it could be explained by the result of acevedo et al that a shift from pao metabolism to gao metabolism occurred with the low level of poly p storage 46 afterwards welles et al investigated the ability of the biomass highly enriched with specific pao clades candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis clade i and ii to adopt a gao metabolism and verified that variation of prelease hacuptake ratio during anaerobic phase was caused by the transformation of pao metabolism in further it was found that both pao i and ii gradually changed their metabolism to gao metabolism when poly p content decreased 42 in this study the stoichiometric ratios of prelease hacuptake of paos during anaerobic phase changed from 0 125 to 0 020 p mol c mol under different operating conditions which were lower than that 0 64 p mol c mol of the typical pao metabolism 42 according to previous studies prelease hacuptake ratio below 0 22 p mol c mol might indicate a mixed pao gao metabolism 42 47 in terms of the discussion above and the phosphorus removal performance of the process the decrease of prelease hacuptake ratio at stages ⅲ3 and ⅳ3 in this study could be due to the shift from pao metabolism to gao metabolism it could also be attributed to the lower do favoring the proliferation of denitrifying bacteria which competed hac with paos during anaerobic phase 48 3 3 interaction of biological phosphorus removal and phosphorus recovery in ebpr system under different side stream ratios in this study the process was characterized as mainstream biological phosphorus removal providing phosphorus source for side stream chemical phosphorus recovery as a matter of fact however side stream phosphorus recovery promoted phosphorus removal in the mainstream system so that effluent phosphorus could meet the discharge standard in most cases this situation could be explained by the result of kim chung that the residual phosphorus loading was reduced due to the partial stripping of phosphorus during anaerobic phase causing rapid assimilation by activated sludge in the subsequent aerobic stage thus chemical precipitation improved the phosphorus removal performance remarkably in the reactor 37 in order to achieve an efficient phosphorus recovery and stable phosphorus removal performance of the process proposed in this study the relationship and interaction between side stream phosphorus recovery and mainstream phosphorus removal was explored fig 5 presented the calculated phosphate uptake efficiency at different side stream ratio and do based on the phosphorus mass balance of the process the calculated phosphate uptake efficiency could be described by eq 1 1 c a l c u l a t e d p u p t a k e e f f i c i e n c y 100 1 p e f f l u e n t p r e l e a s e d m p r e c o v e r e d where peffluent preleased precovered were concentrations of effluent released and recovered phosphorus respectively mg l 1 m was side stream ratio from the perspective of phosphorus removal it could be seen that high phosphate uptake efficiency could be achieved more easily under the condition of relatively higher do or lower side stream ratio for instance at do greater than 0 6 mg l 1 or side stream ratio less than 1 3 phosphate uptake efficiencies were all above 95 if do content lower than 0 6 mg l 1 and side stream ratio larger than 1 3 the system showed a dim phosphorus removal performance with phosphate uptake efficiency decreased significantly indicating that phosphate uptake via paos was inhibited by the combined effect of phosphorus stripping and ultra low do this was consistent with the result of lv et al that the rates of anaerobic phosphorus release and aerobic phosphorus uptake decreased during the side stream period due to the suppression of phosphorus uptake activity 44 in this study mass percentages of effluent recovered and removed phosphorus in the system under different operating conditions as well as phosphorus content in activated sludge were shown in fig 6 it could be seen from fig 6 that there was little difference in the composition of various phosphorus mass percentage at same side stream ratio in run 1 do 1 mg l 1 and run 2 do 0 6 mg l 1 moreover the percentage of phosphorus recovery improved with the increase of side stream extraction ratio under the same do conditions in stage ⅲ1 phosphorus recovered accounted for 26 5 meaning that 79 6 of phosphorus was recovered from 1 3 side stream supernatant thus the highest phosphorus recovered percentage 95 was obtained in stage ⅳ1 almost all the phosphorus from anaerobic supernatant of side stream extraction was recovered in run 3 do 0 2 mg l 1 however phosphorus recovery and removal efficiencies were decreasing drastically with higher side stream ratio phosphorus content in activated sludge was considered as an important factor related to phosphorus recovery many researchers had found that there was a negative correlation between phosphorus recovery rate and phosphorus content in activated sludge 44 45 49 which was consistent with the result of stable operation of the mainstream ebpr system in this study on account of increasing side stream extracting ration nevertheless similar law was not shown at side stream ratio of 1 3 and 1 2 under do 0 2 mg l 1 on account of the uncompleted phosphate uptake under ultra low do environment do 0 2 mg l 1 and subsequent poor phosphate release by paos phosphorus recovery efficiency was not high even though phosphorus content in activated sludge was as low as 0 003 mg p mgvss at side stream ratio of 1 2 statistics of effluent tp and tn in mainstream ebpr system was shown in fig 7 it could be seen that the compliance rates of effluent tn satisfying the requirement of level a class i in the national discharge standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plant gb18918 2002 china in each run were 86 7 83 6 and 98 6 respectively correspondingly effluent tp compliance rates were 82 7 79 1 and 57 5 respectively this was consistent with the removal performance of tn and phosphorus in the system in fig 2 remarkably 60 of effluent tp which didn t meet the requirement was contributed by stage iv3 tp compliance rate could reach 78 6 if the statistics result of stage iv3 was not counted indicating that the metabolic balance in paos was destroyed resulting from excessive deprivation of nutrient under ultra low do conditions as a result the phosphorus removal performance of mainstream system declined it could be seen from table s1 that do concentration and side stream ratio had a more significant impact on phosphorus removal and recovery than on tn and cod removal which was consistent to figs 2 and 6 t test was also performed with the assumption that significance level was 0 05 α 0 05 to analyze the differences of nutrient removal and phosphorus recovery efficiencies under different do concentrations and side stream ratios in table s2 the results showed that do concentration and side stream ratio had more significant effects on phosphorus recovery efficiency compared with nutrient removal efficiency the differences of cod removal efficiency under different do concentrations and side stream ratios were insignificant however lower do concentrations or higher side stream ratios had more significant influence on tn and tp removal efficiencies combined with the results of figs 5 and 6 efficient phosphorus recovery and removal of the process in this study could be achieved at any side stream ratio under do 0 6 mg l 1 to acquire higher phosphorus recovery rate higher anaerobic supernatant extracting ratio was advised in stage iv1 the highest phosphorus recovery rate was observed though effluent tp concentrations fluctuated much more than those in stage iii1 considering the reliable operation of the process and the stability of the effluent quality side stream ratio of 1 3 under do concentration of 1 0 mg l 1 was selected as the optimal condition however phosphorus removal performance of the system did not show irreversible deterioration and could be recovered in the next stage at side stream ratio of 1 2 in run1 and run2 therefore whether extracting anaerobic supernatant for side stream phosphorus recovery under low do condition was more favorable for stable operation of ebpr system needs further study 4 conclusions feasibility and reliability of a process combined anaerobic side stream phosphorus recovery with the mainstream ebpr subjected to low do was assessed through investigating the nutrient removal and phosphorus recovery performance at different side stream extracting ratio under long term low do conditions it was found that do do 1 0 0 6 0 2 mg l 1 as well as side stream ratio m 0 1 4 1 3 1 2 had little impact on the removal of cod and nh4 n the removal performance of tn however increased with the decrease of do due to enhanced simultaneous nitrification and denitrification capability during aerobic phase under low do although phosphate release capability decreased gradually with the decrease of do phosphorus removal performances of run 1 and run 2 were stable and efficient phosphate was nearly completely removed even under do 0 2 mg l 1 except for at side stream ratio of 1 2 in addition high efficiency of both phosphorus recovery and phosphorus removal of the process could be obtained at higher side stream ratio under do 0 6 mg l 1 considering the reliable operation of the process and the stability of the effluent quality side stream ratio of 1 3 under do concentration of 1 0 mg l 1 was chosen as the optimal condition it was proven that extracting reasonable proportion of anaerobic supernatant for recovering phosphorus from the mainstream ebpr subjected to microaerobic environment was feasible and energy saving declaration of competing interest the authors do not

concentration measurement when the sbr operation reached a steady state a track analysis of an entire cycle was carried out the mixture liquor of samples 8 ml was withdrawn from the reactor during the operating cycle at some special points such as the beginning and the end of the feeding the end of anaerobic or aerobic phase and the beginning of effluent discharge once the sample was withdrawn from

results and discussion 3 1 nutrient removal performance of the mainstream ebpr under different operating conditions in this study the side stream precipitation reaction and the mainstream phosphorus removal were two independent and interrelated processes in the matter of reaction itself chemical precipitation and biological reaction occurred in different system and were independent of each other however side stream extraction deprived phosphorus from the mainstream system thus the phosphate level in supernatant as well as the subsequent phosphorus recovery efficiency depended on the anaerobic phosphorus releasing performance of the mainstream ebpr as a result interaction occurred between side stream extraction and phosphorus removal performance in the mainstream system from fig 2 it was shown that cod could be removed steadily in the mainstream ebpr system throughout this experiment the average removal rates of cod were all higher than 92 in each run the extraction of anaerobic supernatant for phosphate recovery and long term low do had little effect on the removal of cod which was similar to the results of lv yuan 17 and ma et al 28 the reason why cod removal efficiency remained high was that organic substances were mainly removed during anaerobic phase in which influent volatile fatty acids vfas was uptaken by paos and synthesized in the form of polyhydroxyalkanoates phas thus subsequent side stream phosphorus recovery operation had little impact on the utilization of organic matter by microorganisms in the mainstream ebpr system do concentration hardly influenced on cod removal according to dong et al 29 similarly even if anaerobic supernatant under the ultra low do concentration condition do 0 2 mg l 1 was extracted cod removal performance of the mainstream ebpr system in this study remained a high level it could also be seen from fig 2 that total nitrogen tn removal efficiency slightly decreased continuously with the increase of side stream ratio in the same run under the same side stream ratio however lower do was more conducive to remove tn therefore tn removal gradually improved with the decrease of do and the average removal rate rose from 70 9 in run 1 to 77 8 in run 3 besides nh4 n removal performance in fig 2 showed that the average concentrations of effluent nh4 n in the three runs were 0 8 3 5 and 3 3 mg l 1 respectively even though the experimental temperature was kept at about 16 the removal of nh4 n decreased slightly with the decrease of do and the increase of side stream extraction frequency however effluent nh4 n stably met the requirement of level a class i in the national discharge standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plant gb18918 2002 china all the time this result was different from the observation of barat van loosdrecht that effluent nh4 n increased significantly when the side stream ratio reached a certain value about 40 30 meanwhile effluent no3 n concentrations declined with the decrease of do and the mean effluent no3 n in run 1 run 2 and run 3 were 10 9 7 9 and 5 2 mg l 1 respectively effluent no3 n was composed of two parts i e the residual of denitrification during anaerobic phase and the amount generated from nitrification during aerobic phase during anaerobic phase excessive carbon source was employed for denitrifying the residual no3 n in previous cycle since phosphorus release capacity by paos weakened and less cod was needed with do decreasing similar to the results of luo et al 31 the amount of phosphate available by paos in the subsequent aerobic phase reduced due to phosphorus recovery operation resulting in more carbon source consumed by denitrifying bacteria instead of paos in the next anaerobic phase in this way denitrifying bacteria gradually was enriched and denitrification was enhanced moreover extremely low do provided an ideal environment for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd during aerobic phase according to the findings of gogina gulshin 32 optimal environment for snd process was provided when do content was lower than 0 5 mg l 1 therefore tn removal performance of the mainstream system was further improved in this study it was also found that the removal performance of tn decreased with the increase of side stream ratio under the same do condition however side stream extraction had a less impact on tn removal compared with do phosphorus removal performance of the mainstream ebpr was also displayed in fig 2 phosphorus removal rates in run 1 and run 2 only fluctuated at the beginning days after changing side stream ratio and then restored gradually both average phosphorus removal rates in run 1 and run 2 were above 90 phosphorus was almost completely removed previous study suggested phosphorus recovery from anaerobic supernatant was beneficial and stimulated the removal of phosphorus to a certain degree 33 nevertheless the most remarkable deterioration of phosphorus removal was found in stage ⅲ3 and ⅳ3 of run 3 the lowest phosphorus removal rate was 59 8 and no recovery was observed during the following experimental period implying that the combination of ultra low do do 0 2 mg l 1 and high side stream ratio m 1 3 1 2 had a certain effect on the performance of phosphorus removal in the mainstream ebpr system 3 2 phosphorus release and uptake capability of ebpr system under different operation conditions to further understand the influence of do and side stream ratio on the phosphorus removal performance of the mainstream ebpr system phosphate release and uptake performance under different operation conditions were evaluated the results were shown in fig 3 from fig 3 phosphate released and uptaken decreased gradually with the increase of side stream ratio under the same do condition the average phosphate released amounts at each side stream ratio of run 1 were 32 8 26 0 22 1 and 18 7 mg l 1 respectively similarly the average amounts were 31 0 24 6 17 9 and 16 0 mg l 1 respectively in run 2 and were 26 5 20 9 15 5 and 6 47 mg l 1 respectively in run 3 the typical profiles of do and po4 3 concentrations during the operating cycles could be seen in fig s1 anaerobic phosphate release rate was an effective indicator of ebpr 34 phosphate released gradually decreased with decreasing do at the same side stream ratio and phosphate uptake time required during aerobic phase was gradually extended especially in stage ⅳ3 phosphate released was as low as 6 47 mg l 1 while residual phosphate was detected at the end of aerobic phase and phosphate uptake rate was lower than that reported in the study of lópez vázquez et al 35 this result was consistent with phosphorus removal effect in fig 2 it was shown that phosphate release activity of paos gradually decreased with the increase of side stream ratio in the case of ultra low do thus side stream phosphorus recovery strategy under ultra low do was not advised to be implemented due to weak biological phosphorus removal performance in the mainstream system under do 0 2 mg l 1 this was different from the results reported by chen et al that better phosphate release and uptake capability could be achieved at lower do levels 24 this difference could be attributed to the decrease of microbial activity caused by long term side stream deprivation of phosphorus under ultra low do in this study compared to the lower do condition do 0 5 mg l 1 in the study of chen et al still phosphate could be almost completely removed in the three runs except for stage iii3 and ⅳ3 in this study the capacity of phosphate release and uptake decreased with the increase of side stream ratio demonstrating that side stream chemical phosphorus recovery had an inhibitory effect on phosphorus removal performance in the mainstream system on one hand do of the ebpr system was maintained at a low level for a long time resulting in a relatively slow microbial metabolism in the system 36 on the other hand extracting anaerobic phosphate rich supernatant was a kind of phosphorus deprivation for the mainstream system if phosphorus in the activated sludge system was introduced into the side stream for chemical phosphorus precipitation insufficient phosphorus was available in the biological phosphorus removal system 37 consequently phosphate uptake by the sludge was affected during aerobic phase resulting in reducing poly p content in the biomass thus phosphorus removal function of the system weakened based on the previous study 38 excessive extraction of phosphorus might lead to the depletion of poly p in biomass which was an important energy source for paos and an indicator of the performance of ebpr system while poly p depletion could result in the proliferation of glycogen accumulating organisms gaos and competition for carbon source with paos which caused failure of the ebpr system 34 39 41 so as to further investigate the reasons for the deterioration of phosphorus removal in the mainstream ebpr system during stage ⅲ3 and ⅳ3 from the aspect of microorganisms metabolism stoichiometric ratios of phosphate release amount to hac uptake amount prelease hacuptake during anaerobic phase in typical cycles under different operating conditions were analyzed in fig 4 the ratio of prelease hacuptake was applied to indicate the activities of paos and gaos in mixed pao gao cultures at a given ph 34 42 43 fig 4 showed that prelease hacuptake decreased not only with the increase of side stream ratio but with the decrease of do which was similar to the observations by lv et al 44 and acevedo et al 45 it could be explained by the result of acevedo et al that a shift from pao metabolism to gao metabolism occurred with the low level of poly p storage 46 afterwards welles et al investigated the ability of the biomass highly enriched with specific pao clades candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis clade i and ii to adopt a gao metabolism and verified that variation of prelease hacuptake ratio during anaerobic phase was caused by the transformation of pao metabolism in further it was found that both pao i and ii gradually changed their metabolism to gao metabolism when poly p content decreased 42 in this study the stoichiometric ratios of prelease hacuptake of paos during anaerobic phase changed from 0 125 to 0 020 p mol c mol under different operating conditions which were lower than that 0 64 p mol c mol of the typical pao metabolism 42 according to previous studies prelease hacuptake ratio below 0 22 p mol c mol might indicate a mixed pao gao metabolism 42 47 in terms of the discussion above and the phosphorus removal performance of the process the decrease of prelease hacuptake ratio at stages ⅲ3 and ⅳ3 in this study could be due to the shift from pao metabolism to gao metabolism it could also be attributed to the lower do favoring the proliferation of denitrifying bacteria which competed hac with paos during anaerobic phase 48 3 3 interaction of biological phosphorus removal and phosphorus recovery in ebpr system under different side stream ratios in this study the process was characterized as mainstream biological phosphorus removal providing phosphorus source for side stream chemical phosphorus recovery as a matter of fact however side stream phosphorus recovery promoted phosphorus removal in the mainstream system so that effluent phosphorus could meet the discharge standard in most cases this situation could be explained by the result of kim chung that the residual phosphorus loading was reduced due to the partial stripping of phosphorus during anaerobic phase causing rapid assimilation by activated sludge in the subsequent aerobic stage thus chemical precipitation improved the phosphorus removal performance remarkably in the reactor 37 in order to achieve an efficient phosphorus recovery and stable phosphorus removal performance of the process proposed in this study the relationship and interaction between side stream phosphorus recovery and mainstream phosphorus removal was explored fig 5 presented the calculated phosphate uptake efficiency at different side stream ratio and do based on the phosphorus mass balance of the process the calculated phosphate uptake efficiency could be described by eq 1 1 c a l c u l a t e d p u p t a k e e f f i c i e n c y 100 1 p e f f l u e n t p r e l e a s e d m p r e c o v e r e d where peffluent preleased precovered were concentrations of effluent released and recovered phosphorus respectively mg l 1 m was side stream ratio from the perspective of phosphorus removal it could be seen that high phosphate uptake efficiency could be achieved more easily under the condition of relatively higher do or lower side stream ratio for instance at do greater than 0 6 mg l 1 or side stream ratio less than 1 3 phosphate uptake efficiencies were all above 95 if do content lower than 0 6 mg l 1 and side stream ratio larger than 1 3 the system showed a dim phosphorus removal performance with phosphate uptake efficiency decreased significantly indicating that phosphate uptake via paos was inhibited by the combined effect of phosphorus stripping and ultra low do this was consistent with the result of lv et al that the rates of anaerobic phosphorus release and aerobic phosphorus uptake decreased during the side stream period due to the suppression of phosphorus uptake activity 44 in this study mass percentages of effluent recovered and removed phosphorus in the system under different operating conditions as well as phosphorus content in activated sludge were shown in fig 6 it could be seen from fig 6 that there was little difference in the composition of various phosphorus mass percentage at same side stream ratio in run 1 do 1 mg l 1 and run 2 do 0 6 mg l 1 moreover the percentage of phosphorus recovery improved with the increase of side stream extraction ratio under the same do conditions in stage ⅲ1 phosphorus recovered accounted for 26 5 meaning that 79 6 of phosphorus was recovered from 1 3 side stream supernatant thus the highest phosphorus recovered percentage 95 was obtained in stage ⅳ1 almost all the phosphorus from anaerobic supernatant of side stream extraction was recovered in run 3 do 0 2 mg l 1 however phosphorus recovery and removal efficiencies were decreasing drastically with higher side stream ratio phosphorus content in activated sludge was considered as an important factor related to phosphorus recovery many researchers had found that there was a negative correlation between phosphorus recovery rate and phosphorus content in activated sludge 44 45 49 which was consistent with the result of stable operation of the mainstream ebpr system in this study on account of increasing side stream extracting ration nevertheless similar law was not shown at side stream ratio of 1 3 and 1 2 under do 0 2 mg l 1 on account of the uncompleted phosphate uptake under ultra low do environment do 0 2 mg l 1 and subsequent poor phosphate release by paos phosphorus recovery efficiency was not high even though phosphorus content in activated sludge was as low as 0 003 mg p mgvss at side stream ratio of 1 2 statistics of effluent tp and tn in mainstream ebpr system was shown in fig 7 it could be seen that the compliance rates of effluent tn satisfying the requirement of level a class i in the national discharge standard of pollutants for municipal wastewater treatment plant gb18918 2002 china in each run were 86 7 83 6 and 98 6 respectively correspondingly effluent tp compliance rates were 82 7 79 1 and 57 5 respectively this was consistent with the removal performance of tn and phosphorus in the system in fig 2 remarkably 60 of effluent tp which didn t meet the requirement was contributed by stage iv3 tp compliance rate could reach 78 6 if the statistics result of stage iv3 was not counted indicating that the metabolic balance in paos was destroyed resulting from excessive deprivation of nutrient under ultra low do conditions as a result the phosphorus removal performance of mainstream system declined it could be seen from table s1 that do concentration and side stream ratio had a more significant impact on phosphorus removal and recovery than on tn and cod removal which was consistent to figs 2 and 6 t test was also performed with the assumption that significance level was 0 05 α 0 05 to analyze the differences of nutrient removal and phosphorus recovery efficiencies under different do concentrations and side stream ratios in table s2 the results showed that do concentration and side stream ratio had more significant effects on phosphorus recovery efficiency compared with nutrient removal efficiency the differences of cod removal efficiency under different do concentrations and side stream ratios were insignificant however lower do concentrations or higher side stream ratios had more significant influence on tn and tp removal efficiencies combined with the results of figs 5 and 6 efficient phosphorus recovery and removal of the process in this study could be achieved at any side stream ratio under do 0 6 mg l 1 to acquire higher phosphorus recovery rate higher anaerobic supernatant extracting ratio was advised in stage iv1 the highest phosphorus recovery rate was observed though effluent tp concentrations fluctuated much more than those in stage iii1 considering the reliable operation of the process and the stability of the effluent quality side stream ratio of 1 3 under do concentration of 1 0 mg l 1 was selected as the optimal condition however phosphorus removal performance of the system did not show irreversible deterioration and could be recovered in the next stage at side stream ratio of 1 2 in run1 and run2 therefore whether extracting anaerobic supernatant for side stream phosphorus recovery under low do condition was more favorable for stable operation of ebpr system needs further study 4 conclusions feasibility and reliability of a process combined anaerobic side stream phosphorus recovery with the mainstream ebpr subjected to low do was assessed through investigating the nutrient removal and phosphorus recovery performance at different side stream extracting ratio under long term low do conditions it was found that do do 1 0 0 6 0 2 mg l 1 as well as side stream ratio m 0 1 4 1 3 1 2 had little impact on the removal of cod and nh4 n the removal performance of tn however increased with the decrease of do due to enhanced simultaneous nitrification and denitrification capability during aerobic phase under low do although phosphate release capability decreased gradually with the decrease of do phosphorus removal performances of run 1 and run 2 were stable and efficient phosphate was nearly completely removed even under do 0 2 mg l 1 except for at side stream ratio of 1 2 in addition high efficiency of both phosphorus recovery and phosphorus removal of the process could be obtained at higher side stream ratio under do 0 6 mg l 1 considering the reliable operation of the process and the stability of the effluent quality side stream ratio of 1 3 under do concentration of 1 0 mg l 1 was chosen as the optimal condition it was proven that extracting reasonable proportion of anaerobic supernatant for recovering phosphorus from the mainstream ebpr subjected to microaerobic environment was feasible and energy saving declaration of competing interest the authors do not

13481,this study intended to assess the performance of a sulfidogenic activated carbon bed bioreactor sacb receiving high concentrations of hexavalent chromium cr6 sacb was tested for 126 days at moderate temperature 20 c with a synthetic feed carrying ethanol as carbon source while employing a hydraulic retention time of 24 h excellent sulfidogenic performance was obtained during both noncr6 added and 100 mg l 1 cr6 added periods sulfate reduction and carbon oxidation performances initially were 99 and 93 respectively and introduction of 100 mg l 1 cr6 to the feed at ph 4 0 resulted in only 3 reduction for both performances during initial testing period alkalinity generation was 99 of the theoretically expected value and effluent ph increased up to 8 2 from ph 6 7 during the cr6 fed period average alkalinity concentration was 2316 mgcaco3 l 1 while ph increased to 8 2 from ph 4 0 with additional acidity consumption during cr6 reduction by the biologically generated sulfide effluent cr6 concentration remained below 0 5 mg l 1 with an average of 0 13 mg l 1 whereas average total chromium concentration in the effluent remained 0 2 mg l 1 batch studies were carried out to better understand stoichiometry and kinetics of cr6 reduction with biogenic sulfide graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords hexavalent chromium reduction chromium removal sulfate reduction sulfate reducing bacteria activated carbon bed bioreactor moderate temperature 1 introduction hexavalent chromium cr6 is a highly toxic heavy metal encountered especially in industrial discharges from chromium plating and leather processing activities being water soluble in a wide ph range cr6 can be transported over aquatic systems spreading far from its originating site 1 the reduced form cr3 on the other hand is less soluble hence less bioavailable and it is less toxic 2 traditional cr6 reduction by means of chemical electrochemical and biological methods were reviewed by barrera díaz et al 3 typical electrochemical approaches for chromium removal can be given as electrodeionization electrodialysis electrochemical reduction and electrocoagulation 4 chemical treatment of cr6 includes chemical reduction via reducing agents such as ferrous sulfate and sodium metabisulfide followed by hydroxide precipitation at elevated phs 5 6 they concluded that chemical and electrochemical processes effectively precipitated chromium and iron as hydroxides however less sludge production is possible via the electrochemical process and that biological aerobic and or anaerobic treatment of cr6 produces even smaller amount of waste with less added chemicals organics and nutrients however it requires isolation identification and proliferation of proper microbial species bacteria fungi from their native environments numerous bacteria and fungi have been reported to be chromium resistant and or tolerant via employing different mechanisms as presented in reviews provided by ahemad 7 and ramirez diaz et al 8 the bacterial resistance mechanisms include membrane transport to enable efflux of cr6 ions via sulfate and iron transport systems and chromate transporters chra that serve as efflux pumps counter action against oxidative stress and dna damage via up regulation of oxidative stress response genes for synthesis of radical scavenging enzymes and sos response enzymes 9 11 bacterial reduction of cr6 is possible under anaerobic conditions via reduction by various organics amino acids nucleotides vitamins etc in the cell serving as electron donors under aerobic anaerobic conditions via production of soluble extracellular reductases and membrane associated reductases which may require an external electron donor such as glucose ahemad 7 also reports fungal resistance to cr6 toxicity is a result of decreased uptake and presence of vacuoles and acid phosphatase enzymes together with reducing mechanisms chromate resistant filamentous fungi isolated from cr6 contaminated soil have been reported to grow in the presence of up to 200 mg l 1 cr6 yeasts c albicans and s cerevisiae up to 50 mg l 1 12 vankova et al 13 studied the toxicity of cr6 on activated sludge and found the ec50 1 h to be in the range of 40 90 mg l 1 whereas vaiopoulu and gikas 9 reported 80 mg l 1 of cr6 as the lethal dose detoxification of cr6 bearing effluents via biogenically generated hydrogen sulfide was shown to be a successful and cost effective treatment alternative to chemical treatment 14 sulfate reducing bacteria srb produce hydrogen sulfide and alkalinity in the presence of organic

s 10 h 4h 2 o 8cr oh 3 s 3so 4 2 however cr6 can have inhibitory effects on biological sulfate reduction 20 and treatment of cr6 bearing streams in sulfidogenic bioprocesses should be carefully designed using efficient bioreactors qian et al 19 observed that after dosing 50 mg l 1 cr6 in batch reactors ph 6 9 biogenic sulfate reduction rate was inhibited by up to 47 song et al 21 reported 130 mg l 1 cr6 caused only a 15 inhibition on srb activity sulfate reducing bacterial biofilms offer advantages such as increased tolerance to higher concentrations of organic and or heavy metal pollutants affecting their sorption transportation and or decomposition in aqueous media 20 22 effective chromium removal after reduction of cr6 to cr3 is possible via formation of stable solid cr3 precipitates as opposed to soluble or colloidal 0 2 μm forms of cr3 which will escape to the effluent streams 23 sahinkaya et al 14 reported excellent cr3 retention in anaerobic baffled reactor where ph could be kept over 7 5 in previous studies efficient sulfate and sulfur reduction together with reductive cr6 removal was reported at mesophilic temperature ranges such as at 32 35 c 10 18 however there is growing interest in achieving energy self sufficient and or energy positive treatment processes to attain sustainability in wastewater management as mentioned by recent studies such as bashar et al 24 who conducted a comprehensive analysis of full scale application to assess the energy requirement reduction potential indicating temperature as one of the dominant parameters controlling energy consumption therefore it is important to eliminate the energy requirement in the sulfidogenic bioprocesses to offer a sustainable treatment solution since unlike methanogenesis sulfate reduction cannot produce energy to be used for heating the bioreactor it was shown that sulfate reduction at low temperatures i e 8 c may be limited by acetate oxidation 25 hence operating a bioreactor at low temperature without limiting acetate oxidation especially when ethanol is used as an external carbon source is important for obtaining high performance with minimal energy consumption for heating the bioreactor a study by sahinkaya et al 18 tested sulfidogenic performance at 22 c in a sulfur reducing packed bed bioreactor and reported significant reduction in sulfide generation and chemical oxygen demand cod oxidation when temperature was decreased these earlier findings may have limited investigation of low temperature sulfidogenic process however recently we have illustrated that efficient sulfate reduction is also possible at a moderate temperature of 23 c in a fluidized bed membrane bioreactor 22 and hypothesized that a satisfactory sulfidogenic performance could be achieved via good biofilm growth of srb on a packed medium at room temperature that could be sustained under acidic high concentration heavy metal loading hence this study aims at evaluating the performance of a sulfidogenic activated carbon bed upflow column bioreactor sacb at moderate temperature 20 1 6 c for detoxification and neutralization of acidic industrial streams containing high concentrations of cr6 the use of activated carbon as a packing media is offered to support both biofilm growth of srb and perform as an additional removal mechanism via adsorption if necessary to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to test the ability of a sulfidogenic culture to treat a cr6 rich wastewater at a temperature below the mesophilic range 2 materials and methods 2 1 sulfidogenic activated carbon bed upflow column bioreactor sacb a laboratory scale up flow anaerobic column bioreactor made of glass with a total volume of 1 7 l h 50 cm d 6 6 cm and water volume of 750 ml was set up for the study fig 1 an active volume of 500 ml was formed with a bed of granular activated carbon with a particle size of 1 1 5 mm diameter in order to remove impurities and eliminate alkalinity interference from gac the gac column was washed with acidic water ph 2 followed by washing with pure water many times until debris free ph neutral effluent was observed synthetic feed solution of desired compositions was fed to the sacb with a peristaltic pump from the bottom of the reactor and the treated effluents were collected into an effluent tank from the upper port hydraulic retention time hrt was adjusted by setting the feed pump flowrate 2 2 operational conditions and synthetic feed compositions sacb was operated for 126 days including start up and enrichment the seed was obtained from a lab scale sulfate reducing fluidized bed membrane bioreactor 22 a 150 ml volume of sludge was mixed with the washed activated carbon as seed before it was placed in the bioreactor hrt was kept 24 h throughout the study by adjusting the feed pump flow at 0 35 ml min 1 the sludge retention time was kept infinite by employing no sludge wastage except for sampling sacb was operated at moderate temperature 20 1 6 c throughout the experimental study a synthetic feed previously used by oztemur et al 22 with ethanol as the carbon source was prepared targeting an influent organics concentration of 2000 mg cod l 1 and influent sulfate concentration of 2000 mg l 1 hence the cod sulfate mg mg 1 ratio was kept around 1 0 which is greater than the theoretical ratio of 0 67 assuming complete oxidation of organic matter to co2 tap water was used during synthetic feed preparations the ph and alkalinity of the cr6 free feed used during the start up and enrichment phase was kept at 6 7 0 3 and 101 mg caco3 l 1 respectively ph of the cr6 containing feed was adjusted to 4 0 0 04 by adding concentrated hcl to simulate the acidic nature of a potential cr6 containing industrial wastewater the influent cr6 concentration tested was 100 mg l 1 2 3 sampling and analytical methods sulfate reduction performance of the sacb was assessed by monitoring the influent and effluent concentrations of cod sulfate sulfide and alkalinity as well as the ph samples from the synthetic feed were taken at each batch preparation every 3 4 days samples from the bioreactor were collected from the sampling port fig 1 at least 3 times per week if not collected daily samples were analyzed for sulfate cod sulfide right after collection and being filtered through 0 45 mm polyethersulfone membrane syringe filters ph and alkalinity were determined with nonfiltered samples cod measurement was carried out according to the closed reflux method 26 after adjusting ph to around 2 0 with concentrated h2so4 with additional 5 min purging for the removal of h2s to prevent sulfide interference sulfate concentration was measured by using bacl2 precipitation via turbidimetric method sulfide concentration was determined via spectrophotometer hach dr 5000 27 alkalinity and liquid ph were determined according to standard methods 26 2 4 estimation of sulfidogenic performance sulfate reduction performance can be assessed by calculating the share of electron flow from the electron donor to sulfate reduction 25 28 which can be calculated based on the

icap 6300 duo usa for the calculation of t cr removal influent cr6 concentration was assumed to be equal to t cr 2 6 batch experiments abiotic batch experiments were designed to investigate the cr6 reduction and cr removal mechanisms in the sulfidogenic bioreactor a final cr6 concentration of 130 mg l 1 was prepared in 100 ml feed solutions adjusted to a final ph of 4 0 to be filled in 150 ml glass bottles the bottles were sealed with rubber septa different volumes of effluents collected from a lactate fed sulfidogenic reactor hs concentration 550 mg l 1 were immediately filtered through 0

prepared to contain only the feed solution and cr6 the batch reactors were placed in shaking incubator at 30 c and 175 rpm for 24 h samples were withdrawn at 1 h 18 h and at the end of 24 h to measure ph sulfide sulfate and cr6 concentrations a single abiotic batch test 100 ml was conducted with initial concentrations of 110 mg l 1 cr6 2110 mg l 1 sulfate and 1 g gac at ph 6 1 and 30 c for 48 h to investigate adsorptive or abiotic reductive removal of cr6 3 results and discussion 3 1 sulfidogenic performance of the sacb sacb was initially tested for a period of 64 days period i for system stability and sulfidogenic performance evaluation with an influent sulfate and cod concentrations of around 2000 mg l 1 in the absence of cr6 hence the cod sulfate ratio was selected as 1 0 for better sulfate reduction performance considering our previous findings 22 excellent sulfate reduction performance 99 was achieved within 12 days after start up and continued through the rest of the period days 13 35 indicating a desired level of srb enrichment via biofilm growth on granular activated carbon limiting the washout of slow growing srb from sacb sacb operation after the enrichment phase days 36 64 yielded very stable results in terms of sulfate reduction carbon oxidation and sulfide and alkalinity generations average sulfide concentration as hs in the bioreactor effluent was 695 50 mg l 1 in this period which corresponded to 99 7 of the theoretically calculated value sulfate reduction and carbon oxidation efficiencies were 99 and 93 respectively resulting in effluent sulfate and cod concentrations of 26 25 mg l 1 and 144 111 mg l 1 respectively the sulfate and sulfide concentration profiles are shown in fig 2 and cod concentration profiles are shown in fig 3 the theoretical hs concentrations fig 2 were calculated assuming that the reduction of cr6 followed the stoichiometry shown in reaction iii at day 65 100 mg l 1 cr6 98 3 mg l 1 was added to the synthetic feed and ph of the feed was decreased to around 4 0 with addition of hcl to simulate acidic medium of metal bearing industrial effluents and the system was operated for another 63 days period ii it was observed that the introduction of 100 mg l 1 cr6 did not cause a dramatic change in the sulfate reduction and or carbon oxidation performance of the sacb only a 3 reduction was observed for both performances in period ii influent sulfate concentration of 2000 mg l 1 2001 200 mg l 1 and cod concentration of 2000 mg l 1 1854 192 mg l 1 were decreased to an average of 81 69 mg l 1 and 188 102 mg l 1 in the bioreactor effluent corresponding to 96 and 90 removal efficiencies respectively a decreased level of effluent sulfide concentration was observed in this period with an average value of 630 76 mg l 1 due to use of hs for cr6 reduction which will be discussed in detail in section 3 3 the sulfate and sulfide concentration profiles after cr6 addition are shown in fig 2 average e flow from organic matter to sulfate reduction in the absence of cr6 was calculated as 74 which was similar to the values reported in the literature between 62 and 79 for sulfidogenic bioreactors utilizing ethanol as carbon source 17 22 25 30 average e flow from organic matter to sulfate reduction after cr6 addition was calculated as 78 which is very close to the value obtained in the absence of cr6 evaluation of alkalinity and ph profiles indicated a high level of alkalinity generation and ph neutralization performance of the sacb the alkalinity and ph profiles days 36 126 excluding start up are shown in fig 4 in the first period average alkalinity produced in sacb was 2126 151 mg caco3 l 1 which corresponded to 99 of the theoretical value the initial ph of 6 7 was increased to an average of 8 2 in the reactor effluent the presence of 100 mg l 1 cr6 in the feed did not adversely affect the alkalinity generation in sacb as the ph of the influent ph 4 increased to 8 2 due to increased alkalinity to a level of 2316 128 mg caco3 l 1 in the effluent in the cr6 fed period measured alkalinity in the bioreactor was slightly higher than the theoretical alkalinity generation 2022 mg caco3 l 1 which was calculated also considering the acid consumption during the cr6 reduction process according to reaction iii shown in section 3 2 ethanol oxidation in the sulfidogenic process occurs as a two stage oxidation reaction i and ii where alkalinity generation is achieved via acetate oxidation in the second stage hence it is important to adjust ethanol feed to the system to prevent build up of acetate 25 the alkalinity generated in the bioreactor and lack of acetate accumulation effluent cod 280 mg l 1 indicated successful enrichment of acetate utilizing srb in the bioreactor although the bioreactor was operated at moderate temperature i e 20 c quite high sulfate reduction together with complete cod oxidation was observed even in the presence of high cr6 concentration most of the studies on sulfidogenic metal precipitation were conducted at temperatures in the range of 30 37 c 31 37 and it is well known that acetate oxidation by srb is the rate limiting step at low temperatures 8 9 c when ethanol or lactate is supplied as carbon source 25 38 39 low acetate oxidation under sulfidogenic conditions results in low sulfide and alkalinity generation together with cod accumulation in the effluent 25 in the study of sahinkaya et al 18 a decrease of temperature from 28 c to 22 c significantly decreased sulfide generation and cod oxidation in an elemental sulfur reducing packed bed bioreactor hence the selection of both organic carbon source and the operating temperature are important for observing high sulfate reduction performance in this study high sulfate reduction and cod oxidation rates close to 2 0 g l 1 d 1 were achieved at moderate temperature of 20 c even in the presence of high cr6 concentration of 100 mg l 1 similar results were also observed in our previous study conducted with fluidized bed mbr at 23 c in the absence of metal feed 22 3 2 hexavalent chromium cr6 reduction and cr oh 3 precipitation experimental data from period ii clearly showed that introduction of 100 mg l 1 of cr6 to sacb resulted in no significant inhibition on the sulfidogenic process and excellent cr6 reduction and removal efficiencies were attained throughout this testing period fig 5 shows the influent and effluent concentrations of cr species cr6 and total cr average cr6 reduction and t cr removal efficiencies both were 99 9 in the cr6 fed period where the effluent cr6 and t cr concentrations were measured as 0 13 0 13 mg l 1 and 0 2 mg l 1 respectively excellent cr removal performance was achieved due to effective sulfidogenic process generating hs for cr6 reduction together with successful ph neutralization enhancing the cr oh 3 precipitation for which minimum solubility is attained at ph 7 10 40 the amount of hs required for the reduction of 1 g of cr6 is calculated as 0 95 g and 0 24 g for reactions iii and iv respectively considering that high hs concentration is attained throughout the operation it was assumed that reaction iii will be more favorable than reaction iv which would require a two step oxidation including further oxidation of elemental s0 to so4 2 assuming that reaction iii is followed average hs concentration in the effluent is estimated as 562 24 mg l 1 whereas the actual hs concentration in the bioreactor effluent in this period was determined as 630 76 mg l 1 although the white plate like formations observed in the reactor were attributed to elemental s0 being formed in the process supporting occurrence of reaction iii the actual hs concentrations measured in the effluent being a little higher 11 than the estimated values based on reaction iii stoichiometry may indicate the occurrence of both reactions in the bioreactor as the chemistry involved in the sulfidogenic process with cr6 is complex and as the elemental s0 could not be measured in the bioreactor no definite conclusions could be drawn as to which stoichiometry is followed for cr6 reduction in sacb other studies in the literature have also reported cr6 reduction and removal efficiencies via sulfidogenic processes sahinkaya et al 18 operated an elemental sulfur reducing packed bed bioreactor 28 30 c with influent cr6 concentrations up to 50 mg l 1 and reported over 97 cr6 reduction and over 85 total chromium removal efficiencies chang and kim 17 operated a two stage packed bed reactor system at 30 c employing an initial neutralization stage followed by a settler and a sulfidogenic bioreactor to treat up to 352 mg l 1 cr6 3 3 abiotic adsorption and biosorption of cr6 abiotic cr6 adsorption onto activated carbon ac was neglected in view of our batch test which showed that the initially present 11 6 mg of cr6 prepared in 100 ml at ph 6 1 in a 150 ml flask with 1 g gac was decreased to 9 mg after 18 h 2 6 mgcr6 ggac 1 and no further reduction was observed until the end of testing period 48 h in this study ph of the medium phave 8 2 is significantly higher than the effective ph range determined for adsorption of cr6 on activated carbon which was stated to be lower than ph 6 with an optimum frequently stated around ph 3 and the adsorption capacity decreased 17 folds with ph increasing ph to 10 from ph 6 41 42 khezami and capart 43 reported maximum adsorptive capacity as 17 5 mgcr6 gac 1 in ph 6 9 range whereas others reported adsorptive capacity to be lower than 5 mgcr6 gac 1 at ph 7 0 44 45 it was also assumed that organic and other inorganic compounds in the feed solution also competed for the available adsorption sites further limiting cr6 adsorption onto ac on the other hand excellent sulfate reduction performance achieved with sacb during the enrichment phase indicated good biofilm growth which clearly requires consideration of the biosorption mechanism lameiras et al 46 worked with continuous flow reactors filled with gac covered with bacterial biofilm of arthrobacter viscosus to remove cr6 initial concentration 70 mg l 1 at a ph range of 4 5 5 5 at 26 c and reported that the adsorption capacity is slightly lower than 2 mgcr6 ggac 1 a similar assumption in our system would indicate that biosorption could be an effective cr6 removal mechanism only for around 12 days whereas the sacb was operated for 62 days which was long enough to eliminate biosorption as an effective mechanism for cr6 removal in sacb 3 4 batch studies batch tests were conducted for the investigation of reduction and removal kinetics of cr6 by biogenic hydrogen sulfide with the addition of varying amounts of hs that correspond to 0 4 0 8 and 1 5 times the stoichiometric amounts reaction iii at ph 4 and ph 8 5 the control test with no hs showed no change in cr6 and so4 2 concentrations the cr6 concentration profiles obtained in the batch tests are shown in fig 6 it was observed that 96 of cr6 reduction could be reached within 1 h when 1 5 times the stoichiometric amount of hs was present in the solution at ph 4 similarly chang and kim 17 found that complete cr6 removal could be achieved when electrons from sulfide oxidation to elemental sulfur was at least 1 3 times higher than electrons required for cr6 reduction to cr3 at ph 6 2 sahinkaya et al 18 found that adsorption on and or reduction by elemental sulfur can be neglected and cr6 reduction followed the stoichiometry of reaction iii hs consumption and change in ph is shown in fig 7 an increase in ph was observed in all batch tests after biogenic sulfide supplementation due to alkalinity coming from the biogenic sulfide solution the ph was increased to ph 8 5 from an initial value of ph 4 0 where all cr6 could be successfully reduced a certain fraction of cr6 could also be reduced by the organics or inorganics present in the solutions added to provide biogenic hs for the batch tests as reported by sahinkaya et al 18 to be about 10 of the initially present cr6 this also explains the further reduction of cr6 after all hs is consumed in the medium 4 conclusions the present study illustrated the high performance of sulfate reducing and ethanol oxidizing packed bed bioreactor for reductive cr6 removal almost complete sulfate reduction and cod oxidation were attained together with high sulfide and alkalinity generation even at a moderate temperature of 20 c complete organic matter oxidation without acetate accumulation verified by cod measurement resulted in high alkalinity generation which increased the feed ph from 4 0 to neutral values in the effluent almost complete reductive chromium removal was observed when its concentration in the feed was as high as 100 mg l 1 hence simultaneous removal of sulfate and chromium together with increasing ph was achieved in a high rate bioreactor at a moderate temperature of 20 c which illustrated that the process deserves further testing first

13481,this study intended to assess the performance of a sulfidogenic activated carbon bed bioreactor sacb receiving high concentrations of hexavalent chromium cr6 sacb was tested for 126 days at moderate temperature 20 c with a synthetic feed carrying ethanol as carbon source while employing a hydraulic retention time of 24 h excellent sulfidogenic performance was obtained during both noncr6 added and 100 mg l 1 cr6 added periods sulfate reduction and carbon oxidation performances initially were 99 and 93 respectively and introduction of 100 mg l 1 cr6 to the feed at ph 4 0 resulted in only 3 reduction for both performances during initial testing period alkalinity generation was 99 of the theoretically expected value and effluent ph increased up to 8 2 from ph 6 7 during the cr6 fed period average alkalinity concentration was 2316 mgcaco3 l 1 while ph increased to 8 2 from ph 4 0 with additional acidity consumption during cr6 reduction by the biologically generated sulfide effluent cr6 concentration remained below 0 5 mg l 1 with an average of 0 13 mg l 1 whereas average total chromium concentration in the effluent remained 0 2 mg l 1 batch studies were carried out to better understand stoichiometry and kinetics of cr6 reduction with biogenic sulfide graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords hexavalent chromium reduction chromium removal sulfate reduction sulfate reducing bacteria activated carbon bed bioreactor moderate temperature 1 introduction hexavalent chromium cr6 is a highly toxic heavy metal encountered especially in industrial discharges from chromium plating and leather processing activities being water soluble in a wide ph range cr6 can be transported over aquatic systems spreading far from its originating site 1 the reduced form cr3 on the other hand is less soluble hence less bioavailable and it is less toxic 2 traditional cr6 reduction by means of chemical electrochemical and biological methods were reviewed by barrera díaz et al 3 typical electrochemical approaches for chromium removal can be given as electrodeionization electrodialysis electrochemical reduction and electrocoagulation 4 chemical treatment of cr6 includes chemical reduction via reducing agents such as ferrous sulfate and sodium metabisulfide followed by hydroxide precipitation at elevated phs 5 6 they concluded that chemical and electrochemical processes effectively precipitated chromium and iron as hydroxides however less sludge production is possible via the electrochemical process and that biological aerobic and or anaerobic treatment of cr6 produces even smaller amount of waste with less added chemicals organics and nutrients however it requires isolation identification and proliferation of proper microbial species bacteria fungi from their native environments numerous bacteria and fungi have been reported to be chromium resistant and or tolerant via employing different mechanisms as presented in reviews provided by ahemad 7 and ramirez diaz et al 8 the bacterial resistance mechanisms include membrane transport to enable efflux of cr6 ions via sulfate and iron transport systems and chromate transporters chra that serve as efflux pumps counter action against oxidative stress and dna damage via up regulation of oxidative stress response genes for synthesis of radical scavenging enzymes and sos response enzymes 9 11 bacterial reduction of cr6 is possible under anaerobic conditions via reduction by various organics amino acids nucleotides vitamins etc in the cell serving as electron donors under aerobic anaerobic conditions via production of soluble extracellular reductases and membrane associated reductases which may require an external electron donor such as glucose ahemad 7 also reports fungal resistance to cr6 toxicity is a result of decreased uptake and presence of vacuoles and acid phosphatase enzymes together with reducing mechanisms chromate resistant filamentous fungi isolated from cr6 contaminated soil have been reported to grow in the presence of up to 200 mg l 1 cr6 yeasts c albicans and s cerevisiae up to 50 mg l 1 12 vankova et al 13 studied the toxicity of cr6 on activated sludge and found the ec50 1 h to be in the range of 40 90 mg l 1 whereas vaiopoulu and gikas 9 reported 80 mg l 1 of cr6 as the lethal dose detoxification of cr6 bearing effluents via biogenically generated hydrogen sulfide was shown to be a successful and cost effective treatment alternative to chemical treatment 14 sulfate reducing bacteria srb produce hydrogen sulfide and alkalinity in the presence of organic

s 10 h 4h 2 o 8cr oh 3 s 3so 4 2 however cr6 can have inhibitory effects on biological sulfate reduction 20 and treatment of cr6 bearing streams in sulfidogenic bioprocesses should be carefully designed using efficient bioreactors qian et al 19 observed that after dosing 50 mg l 1 cr6 in batch reactors ph 6 9 biogenic sulfate reduction rate was inhibited by up to 47 song et al 21 reported 130 mg l 1 cr6 caused only a 15 inhibition on srb activity sulfate reducing bacterial biofilms offer advantages such as increased tolerance to higher concentrations of organic and or heavy metal pollutants affecting their sorption transportation and or decomposition in aqueous media 20 22 effective chromium removal after reduction of cr6 to cr3 is possible via formation of stable solid cr3 precipitates as opposed to soluble or colloidal 0 2 μm forms of cr3 which will escape to the effluent streams 23 sahinkaya et al 14 reported excellent cr3 retention in anaerobic baffled reactor where ph could be kept over 7 5 in previous studies efficient sulfate and sulfur reduction together with reductive cr6 removal was reported at mesophilic temperature ranges such as at 32 35 c 10 18 however there is growing interest in achieving energy self sufficient and or energy positive treatment processes to attain sustainability in wastewater management as mentioned by recent studies such as bashar et al 24 who conducted a comprehensive analysis of full scale application to assess the energy requirement reduction potential indicating temperature as one of the dominant parameters controlling energy consumption therefore it is important to eliminate the energy requirement in the sulfidogenic bioprocesses to offer a sustainable treatment solution since unlike methanogenesis sulfate reduction cannot produce energy to be used for heating the bioreactor it was shown that sulfate reduction at low temperatures i e 8 c may be limited by acetate oxidation 25 hence operating a bioreactor at low temperature without limiting acetate oxidation especially when ethanol is used as an external carbon source is important for obtaining high performance with minimal energy consumption for heating the bioreactor a study by sahinkaya et al 18 tested sulfidogenic performance at 22 c in a sulfur reducing packed bed bioreactor and reported significant reduction in sulfide generation and chemical oxygen demand cod oxidation when temperature was decreased these earlier findings may have limited investigation of low temperature sulfidogenic process however recently we have illustrated that efficient sulfate reduction is also possible at a moderate temperature of 23 c in a fluidized bed membrane bioreactor 22 and hypothesized that a satisfactory sulfidogenic performance could be achieved via good biofilm growth of srb on a packed medium at room temperature that could be sustained under acidic high concentration heavy metal loading hence this study aims at evaluating the performance of a sulfidogenic activated carbon bed upflow column bioreactor sacb at moderate temperature 20 1 6 c for detoxification and neutralization of acidic industrial streams containing high concentrations of cr6 the use of activated carbon as a packing media is offered to support both biofilm growth of srb and perform as an additional removal mechanism via adsorption if necessary to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to test the ability of a sulfidogenic culture to treat a cr6 rich wastewater at a temperature below the mesophilic range 2 materials and methods 2 1 sulfidogenic activated carbon bed upflow column bioreactor sacb a laboratory scale up flow anaerobic column bioreactor made of glass with a total volume of 1 7 l h 50 cm d 6 6 cm and water volume of 750 ml was set up for the study fig 1 an active volume of 500 ml was formed with a bed of granular activated carbon with a particle size of 1 1 5 mm diameter in order to remove impurities and eliminate alkalinity interference from gac the gac column was washed with acidic water ph 2 followed by washing with pure water many times until debris free ph neutral effluent was observed synthetic feed solution of desired compositions was fed to the sacb with a peristaltic pump from the bottom of the reactor and the treated effluents were collected into an effluent tank from the upper port hydraulic retention time hrt was adjusted by setting the feed pump flowrate 2 2 operational conditions and synthetic feed compositions sacb was operated for 126 days including start up and enrichment the seed was obtained from a lab scale sulfate reducing fluidized bed membrane bioreactor 22 a 150 ml volume of sludge was mixed with the washed activated carbon as seed before it was placed in the bioreactor hrt was kept 24 h throughout the study by adjusting the feed pump flow at 0 35 ml min 1 the sludge retention time was kept infinite by employing no sludge wastage except for sampling sacb was operated at moderate temperature 20 1 6 c throughout the experimental study a synthetic feed previously used by oztemur et al 22 with ethanol as the carbon source was prepared targeting an influent organics concentration of 2000 mg cod l 1 and influent sulfate concentration of 2000 mg l 1 hence the cod sulfate mg mg 1 ratio was kept around 1 0 which is greater than the theoretical ratio of 0 67 assuming complete oxidation of organic matter to co2 tap water was used during synthetic feed preparations the ph and alkalinity of the cr6 free feed used during the start up and enrichment phase was kept at 6 7 0 3 and 101 mg caco3 l 1 respectively ph of the cr6 containing feed was adjusted to 4 0 0 04 by adding concentrated hcl to simulate the acidic nature of a potential cr6 containing industrial wastewater the influent cr6 concentration tested was 100 mg l 1 2 3 sampling and analytical methods sulfate reduction performance of the sacb was assessed by monitoring the influent and effluent concentrations of cod sulfate sulfide and alkalinity as well as the ph samples from the synthetic feed were taken at each batch preparation every 3 4 days samples from the bioreactor were collected from the sampling port fig 1 at least 3 times per week if not collected daily samples were analyzed for sulfate cod sulfide right after collection and being filtered through 0 45 mm polyethersulfone membrane syringe filters ph and alkalinity were determined with nonfiltered samples cod measurement was carried out according to the closed reflux method 26 after adjusting ph to around 2 0 with concentrated h2so4 with additional 5 min purging for the removal of h2s to prevent sulfide interference sulfate concentration was measured by using bacl2 precipitation via turbidimetric method sulfide concentration was determined via spectrophotometer hach dr 5000 27 alkalinity and liquid ph were determined according to standard methods 26 2 4 estimation of sulfidogenic performance sulfate reduction performance can be assessed by calculating the share of electron flow from the electron donor to sulfate reduction 25 28 which can be calculated based on the

icap 6300 duo usa for the calculation of t cr removal influent cr6 concentration was assumed to be equal to t cr 2 6 batch experiments abiotic batch experiments were designed to investigate the cr6 reduction and cr removal mechanisms in the sulfidogenic bioreactor a final cr6 concentration of 130 mg l 1 was prepared in 100 ml feed solutions adjusted to a final ph of 4 0 to be filled in 150 ml glass bottles the bottles were sealed with rubber septa different volumes of effluents collected from a lactate fed sulfidogenic reactor hs concentration 550 mg l 1 were immediately filtered through 0 45 μm syringe filters and injected to each bottle to supply 0 4 0 8 1 and 1 5 times of the stoichiometric hs requirement 0 95 mg hs mg cr6 1 to reduce 130 mg l 1 of cr6 a control bottle was also prepared to contain only the feed solution and cr6 the batch reactors were placed in shaking incubator at 30 c and 175 rpm for 24 h samples were withdrawn at 1 h 18 h and at the end of 24 h to measure ph sulfide sulfate and cr6 concentrations a single abiotic batch test 100 ml was conducted with initial concentrations of 110 mg l 1 cr6 2110 mg l 1 sulfate and 1 g gac at ph 6 1 and 30 c for 48 h to investigate adsorptive or abiotic reductive removal of cr6 3 results and discussion 3 1 sulfidogenic performance of the sacb sacb was initially tested for a period of 64 days period i for system stability and sulfidogenic performance evaluation with an influent sulfate and cod concentrations of around 2000 mg l 1 in the absence of cr6 hence the cod sulfate ratio was selected as 1 0 for better sulfate reduction performance considering our previous findings 22 excellent sulfate reduction performance 99 was achieved within 12 days after start up and continued through the rest of the period days 13 35 indicating a desired level of srb enrichment via biofilm growth on granular activated carbon limiting the washout of slow growing srb from sacb sacb operation after the enrichment phase days 36 64 yielded very stable results in terms of sulfate reduction carbon oxidation and sulfide and alkalinity generations average sulfide concentration as hs in the bioreactor effluent was 695 50 mg l 1 in this period which corresponded to 99 7 of the theoretically calculated value sulfate reduction and carbon oxidation efficiencies were 99 and 93 respectively resulting in effluent sulfate and cod concentrations of 26 25 mg l 1 and 144 111 mg l 1 respectively the sulfate and sulfide concentration profiles are shown in fig 2 and cod concentration profiles are shown in fig 3 the theoretical hs concentrations fig 2 were calculated assuming that the reduction of cr6 followed the stoichiometry shown in reaction iii at day 65 100 mg l 1 cr6 98 3 mg l 1 was added to the synthetic feed and ph of the feed was decreased to around 4 0 with addition of hcl to simulate acidic medium of metal bearing industrial effluents and the system was operated for another 63 days period ii it was observed that the introduction of 100 mg l 1 cr6 did not cause a dramatic change in the sulfate reduction and or carbon oxidation performance of the sacb only a 3 reduction was observed for both performances in period ii influent sulfate concentration of 2000 mg l 1 2001 200 mg l 1 and cod concentration of 2000 mg l 1 1854 192 mg l 1 were decreased to an average of 81 69 mg l 1 and 188 102 mg l 1 in the bioreactor effluent corresponding to 96 and 90 removal efficiencies respectively a decreased level of effluent sulfide concentration was observed in this period with an average value of 630 76 mg l 1 due to use of hs for cr6 reduction which will be discussed in detail in section 3 3 the sulfate and sulfide concentration profiles after cr6 addition are shown in fig 2 average e flow from organic matter to sulfate reduction in the absence of cr6 was calculated as 74 which was similar to the values reported in the literature between 62 and 79 for sulfidogenic bioreactors utilizing ethanol as carbon source 17 22 25 30 average e flow from organic matter to sulfate reduction after cr6 addition was calculated as 78 which is very close to the value obtained in the absence of cr6 evaluation of alkalinity and ph profiles indicated a high level of alkalinity generation and ph neutralization performance of the sacb the alkalinity and ph profiles days 36 126 excluding start up are shown in fig 4 in the first period average alkalinity produced in sacb was 2126 151 mg caco3 l 1 which corresponded to 99 of the theoretical value the initial ph of 6 7 was increased to an average of 8 2 in the reactor effluent the presence of 100 mg l 1 cr6 in the feed did not adversely affect the alkalinity generation in sacb as the ph of the influent ph 4 increased to 8 2 due to increased alkalinity to a level of 2316 128 mg caco3 l 1 in the effluent in the cr6 fed period measured alkalinity in the bioreactor was slightly higher than the theoretical alkalinity generation 2022 mg caco3 l 1 which was calculated also considering the acid consumption during the cr6 reduction process according to reaction iii shown in section 3 2 ethanol oxidation in the sulfidogenic process occurs as a two stage oxidation reaction i and ii where alkalinity generation is achieved via acetate oxidation in the second stage hence it is important to adjust ethanol feed to the system to prevent build up of acetate 25 the alkalinity generated in the bioreactor and lack of acetate accumulation effluent cod 280 mg l 1 indicated successful enrichment of acetate utilizing srb in the bioreactor although the bioreactor was operated at moderate temperature i e 20 c quite high sulfate reduction together with complete cod oxidation was observed even in the presence of high cr6 concentration most of the studies on sulfidogenic metal precipitation were conducted at temperatures in the range of 30 37 c 31 37 and it is well known that acetate oxidation by srb is the rate limiting step at low temperatures 8 9 c when ethanol or lactate is supplied as carbon source 25 38 39 low acetate oxidation under sulfidogenic conditions results in low sulfide and alkalinity generation together with cod accumulation in the effluent 25 in the study of sahinkaya et al 18 a decrease of temperature from 28 c to 22 c significantly decreased sulfide generation and cod oxidation in an elemental sulfur reducing packed bed bioreactor hence the selection of both organic carbon source and the operating temperature are important for observing high sulfate reduction performance in this study high sulfate reduction and cod oxidation rates close to 2 0 g l 1 d 1 were achieved at moderate temperature of 20 c even in the presence of high cr6 concentration of 100 mg l 1 similar results were also observed in our previous study conducted with fluidized bed mbr at 23 c in the absence of metal feed 22 3 2 hexavalent chromium cr6 reduction and cr oh 3 precipitation experimental data from period ii clearly showed that introduction of 100 mg l 1 of cr6 to sacb resulted in no significant inhibition on the sulfidogenic process and excellent cr6 reduction and removal efficiencies were attained throughout this testing period fig 5 shows the influent and effluent concentrations of cr species cr6 and total cr average cr6 reduction and t cr removal efficiencies both were 99 9 in the cr6 fed period where the effluent cr6 and t cr concentrations were measured as 0 13 0 13 mg l 1 and 0 2 mg l 1 respectively excellent cr removal performance was achieved due to effective sulfidogenic process generating hs for cr6 reduction together with successful ph neutralization enhancing the cr oh 3 precipitation for which minimum solubility is attained at ph 7 10 40 the amount of hs required for the reduction of 1 g of cr6 is calculated as 0 95 g and 0 24 g for reactions iii and iv respectively considering that high hs concentration is attained throughout the operation it was assumed that reaction iii will be more favorable than reaction iv which would require a two step oxidation including further oxidation of elemental s0 to so4 2 assuming that reaction iii is followed average hs concentration in the effluent is estimated as 562 24 mg l 1 whereas the actual hs concentration in the bioreactor effluent in this period was determined as 630 76 mg l 1 although the white plate like formations observed in the reactor were attributed to elemental s0 being formed in the process supporting occurrence of reaction iii the actual hs concentrations measured in the effluent being a little higher 11 than the

the elemental s0 could not be measured in the bioreactor no definite conclusions could be drawn as to which stoichiometry is followed for cr6 reduction in sacb other studies in the literature have also reported cr6 reduction and removal efficiencies via sulfidogenic processes sahinkaya et al 18 operated an elemental sulfur reducing packed bed bioreactor 28 30 c with influent cr6 concentrations up to 50 mg l 1 and reported over 97 cr6 reduction and over 85 total chromium removal efficiencies chang and kim 17 operated a two stage packed bed reactor system at 30 c employing an initial neutralization stage followed by a settler and a sulfidogenic bioreactor to treat up to 352 mg l 1 cr6 3 3 abiotic adsorption and biosorption of cr6 abiotic cr6 adsorption onto activated carbon ac was neglected in view of our batch test which showed that the initially present 11 6 mg of cr6 prepared in 100 ml at ph 6 1 in a 150 ml flask with 1 g gac was decreased to 9 mg after 18 h 2 6 mgcr6 ggac 1 and no further reduction was observed until the end of testing period 48 h in this study ph of the medium phave 8 2 is significantly higher than the effective ph range determined for adsorption of cr6 on activated carbon which was stated to be lower than ph 6 with an optimum frequently stated around ph 3 and the adsorption capacity decreased 17 folds with ph increasing ph to 10 from ph 6 41 42 khezami and capart 43 reported maximum adsorptive capacity as 17 5 mgcr6 gac 1 in ph 6 9 range whereas others reported adsorptive capacity to be lower than 5 mgcr6 gac 1 at ph 7 0 44 45 it was also assumed that organic and other inorganic compounds in the feed solution also competed for the available adsorption sites further limiting cr6 adsorption onto ac on the other hand excellent sulfate reduction performance achieved with sacb during the enrichment phase indicated good biofilm growth which clearly requires consideration of the biosorption mechanism lameiras et al 46 worked with continuous flow reactors filled with gac covered with bacterial biofilm of arthrobacter viscosus to remove cr6 initial concentration 70 mg l 1 at a ph range of 4 5 5 5 at 26 c and reported that the adsorption capacity is slightly lower than 2 mgcr6 ggac 1 a similar assumption in our system would indicate that biosorption could be an effective cr6 removal mechanism only for around 12 days whereas the sacb was operated for 62 days which was long enough to eliminate biosorption as an effective mechanism for cr6 removal in sacb 3 4 batch studies batch tests were conducted for the investigation of reduction and removal kinetics of cr6 by biogenic hydrogen sulfide with the addition of varying amounts of hs that correspond to 0 4 0 8 and 1 5 times the stoichiometric amounts reaction iii at ph 4 and ph 8 5 the control test with no hs showed no change in cr6 and so4 2 concentrations the cr6 concentration profiles obtained in the batch tests are shown in fig 6 it was observed that 96 of cr6 reduction could be reached within 1 h when 1 5 times the stoichiometric amount of hs was present in the solution at ph 4 similarly chang and kim 17 found that complete cr6 removal could be achieved when electrons from sulfide oxidation to elemental sulfur was at least 1 3 times higher than electrons required for cr6 reduction to cr3 at ph 6 2 sahinkaya et al 18 found that adsorption on and or reduction by elemental sulfur can be neglected and cr6 reduction followed the stoichiometry of reaction iii hs consumption and change in ph is shown in fig 7 an increase in ph was observed in all batch tests after biogenic sulfide supplementation due to alkalinity coming from the biogenic sulfide solution the ph was increased to ph 8 5 from an initial value of ph 4 0 where all cr6 could be successfully reduced a certain fraction of cr6 could also be reduced by the organics or inorganics present in the solutions added to provide biogenic hs for the batch tests as reported by sahinkaya et al 18 to be about 10 of the initially present cr6 this also explains the further reduction of cr6 after all hs is consumed in the medium 4 conclusions the present study illustrated the high performance of sulfate reducing and ethanol oxidizing packed bed bioreactor for reductive cr6 removal almost complete sulfate reduction and cod oxidation were attained together with high sulfide and alkalinity generation even at a moderate temperature of 20 c complete organic matter oxidation without acetate accumulation verified by cod measurement resulted in high alkalinity generation which increased the feed ph from 4 0 to neutral values in the effluent almost complete reductive chromium removal was observed when its concentration in the feed was as high as 100 mg l 1 hence simultaneous removal of sulfate and chromium together with increasing ph was achieved in a high rate bioreactor at a moderate temperature of 20 c which illustrated that the process deserves further testing first in a pilot and then full scale applications for the treatment of metal containing industrial effluents such as electroplating wastewaters declaration of competing interest the authors declare the

38 proposed a spiral reactor designed for biodiesel production under supercritical conditions the spiral reactor turned triglyceride and ethanol into fattyacid ethyl ester and glycerol through

found that after indole reacts in supercritical water the gas phase product does not contain nitrogen containing substances and the nitrogen in the residual liquid is in the form of ammonia nitrogen chen 41 paid attention to the carbon distribution of sewage sludge in supercritical water under different conditions in previous studies most attempts to dispose udmh wastewater are attached with various obstacles such as secondary pollution and limit to experimental stage in this paper study on gasification of methylhydrazine mmh in supercritical water was implemented in spiral continuous system to enhance heat and mass transfer mmh was used as model compound on account of similarity of their structure and udmh s commercial unavailability the effect of several parameters including temperature 450 550 c feeding flow rate 10 75 g min feeding concentration 5 30 and catalyst type on gasification were systematically investigated in addition the migration of carbon and nitrogen was also conducted 2 experiment 2 1 apparatus and methods the kinetic parameters of mmh degraded in supercritical water were obtained using a quartz tube reactor to eliminate the potential possibility of catalytic effect imposed by metal wall the detailed procedure could be refer to the reference 42 a spiral tube reaction system suitable for udmh was designed according to the gasification characteristics of it mmh was used as model compound due to udmh s commercial unavailability the schematic diagram of the system is shown in fig 1 the reactor was designed for temperature up to 650 c and pressure up to 30 mpa and was made of 316 stainless steel i d 7 mm o d 14 mm length 12000 mm the temperature of fluid was measured by armored thermocouple and the pressure of the system was regulated by a back pressure valve with a deviation of 0 5 mpa the specific operation steps of the system is as follow after the feedstock and water are mixed in a certain proportion they are added into the feedstock storage tank start the system when the pressure is stable turn on the preheater and heat up the system when the temperature of the system reaches the experimental requirements water and feedstock are driven into the reactor in this way the feedstock driven into the reactor can reach the target temperature as soon as possible and reduce the side reaction the feedstock is first gasified in the gasification section of the reactor after part of heat is transferred to the preheater through the heat exchanger the gas is separated in the high pressure gas liquid separator and sampled for testing the remaining liquid continues to enter the ammonia nitrogen removal section after that the residual liquid passes the back pressure valve to release the pressure to atmospheric pressure and then the final liquid is sampled from the low pressure gas liquid separator and tested we have conducted a large number of experiments and found that in this experimental system the gas production and the content of organic components in residual liquid can reach a stable level after 10 min of feeding therefore in order to improve the experimental efficiency and accuracy online

residual liquid was determined by elementar vario toc the quantitative analysis of mmh was measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc equipped with an ultraviolet detector waters2695 2996 3 results and discussion 3 1 measurement and comparison of reaction kinetic parameters the determination of chemical reaction kinetic parameters together with thermodynamic characteristics plays a vital role in designing of the reactor according to thermodynamic calculations the reaction of mmh in supercritical water is an endothermic reaction so the fluid should be continuously supplied with heat to maintain the reaction temperature in order to eliminate the influence of reaction products on the determination of reaction order the initial rate method was employed quartz tube provides non catalytic condition for the reaction of mmh in supercritical water which makes the results reflect the essence of the reaction different concentrations 5 wt 10 wt 20 wt of mmh were reacted under 450 c 23 mpa to determine the order of the reaction based on that fit the corresponding reaction rate constants at different temperatures and then determine the activation energy and pre exponential factor through arrhenius formula we use the slope between the concentration of raw material and that of mmh after one minute s reaction to approximate its initial degradation rate in supercritical water as shown in fig 2 a a few points should be noted during the experiment and calculation reactants added become homogeneous phase in supercritical water filled with quartz tube so the volume of the quartz tube acts as reaction volume when calculating the reactant concentration the amount of water added must ensure that the reactants are in supercritical state before or after the reaction the pressure calculation is obtained through one to one correspondence between water density and pressure under different conditions the reaction rate equation of mmh in supercritical water can be expressed as 4 ν d c m m h d t k m m h n a w a t e r n b where k is reaction rate constant x is concentration of different reactants nx is the reaction order of different reactants n na nb is the total reaction order because water is always in excess during the reaction so eq 4 could be re expressed as 5 ν d c m m h d t k m m h n a where k k w a t e r n b therefore the calculated reaction order and activation energy are both apparent values based on the above analysis and the data obtained as shown in fig 2 we obtained the reaction order and kinetic parameters through the following steps first the reaction order is obtained by the initial rate method through fitting under the condition of 450 c then calculate the reaction constants at different temperatures and obtain the activation energy and pre exponential factor through arrhenius formula table 2 gives the kinetic parameters of mmh degraded in supercritical water the reaction order is generally an integer so the reaction is determined to be apparent first order the activation energy can reflect the degree of difficulty of chemical reactions under certain conditions by comparison with other different reactants as shown in table 2 the activation energy for mmh is much lower than others meaning that mmh is easily degradable in supercritical water according to the above analysis of thermodynamics and kinetics four temperatures of 450 c 480 c 520 c and 550 c were selected for the experiment in the spiral tube continuous reactor the experimental conditions were as follow 23 mpa the ratio of water inlet flow to feedstock flow was 90 to 30 3 2 effect of temperature the influence of temperature on gasification of mmh in supercritical water is shown in fig 3 the main gaseous products are h2 co ch4 c2h6 and n2 among which h2 ch4 and n2 account for the main part it can be seen from the figure that temperature has the most obvious effect on ce from 62 at 450 c to 82 at 550 c increasing by 32 the gas production shown in fig 3 c is the gas production per 20 min in the case of steady gas production it also increases from 25 l to 37 l showing a steady growth trend it is worth noting that the gas yield of h2 increased from 4 0 mol kg at 450 c to 12 5 mol kg at 550 c increasing by 212 2 while the h2 gasification efficiency increased from 46 8 at 450 c to 72 9 at 550 c increasing by 55 8 indicating that more water may be involved in the reaction at high temperature temperature also has a certain effect on the gas fraction as temperature increases the gas fraction of n2 and ch4 has a decline tendency while that of h2 increases observably in addition elementary reactions with different activation energies have different sensitivity to temperature 49 so the directional control of the product can be achieved by changing the temperature once entered into the reactor mmh could undergo pyrolysis or steam reforming which are both endothermic reactions as a result the increase of temperature could enhance the degradation of mmh and thus produce more gaseous products water gas shift reaction and methanation are regarded as two main reactions among gaseous products in scwg the reaction equations and their thermodynamic data are shown in supplementary equations 1 3 and table 2 the elevated temperature will cause the equilibrium to move to the left and the equilibrium constant to decrease but the reduction levels are different obviously the increase in temperature makes the equilibrium constant of methanation change more therefore methane has a tendency to decrease and hydrogen tends to increase in terms of gas fraction on the other hand the increased temperature could also promote the degradation of mmh and further improve the hydrogen production as for the increase of methane production it could be explained by the abundance of hydrogen radical with the increase of temperature ch4 is possibly mainly formed by free radical reactions 50 through capture of the methyl attached to nitrogen in brief the increase of temperature could promote the gas production and change the gas composition through its impact on different reactions and the increase rate of hydrogen is higher than methane ce and nitrogen production also have a increase tendency whose distribution rule will be discussed in later sections still the gasification performance has a room for improvement so other parameters such as feeding flow rate feedstock concentration and the effect of catalyst need optimizing 3 3 effect of feeding flow rate the residence time of the reactants in the reactor is different along with the difference of the feeding flow rate if the feeding flow rate is too low the efficiency of processing the material per unit time will be reduced and energy will also be wasted if the feeding flow rate is too high the residence time of the feedstock in the reactor will be insufficient thus the feedstock will be discharged from the reactor without complete reaction this will not only fail to make full use of the chemical energy in the feedstock but also cause the organic compounds in the residual liquid to exceed the emission standard and cause pollution to the environment therefore it is necessary to explore a suitable feeding flow rate to maximize the benefits of the reactor the experimental conditions were 500 c 23 mpa feedstock concentration of 10 the operation process is roughly the same as the previous one the only difference is that during the 30 min of water flow there is no need to change the system temperature just adjust the flow rate of the feed pump to the required rate the influence of feeding flow rate on gasification of mmh in supercritical water is shown in fig 4 as it can be seen although the gas production increases from 19 l at 10 g min to 55 l at 75 g min all three indicators decreases with the increase of the feeding flow rate carbon gasification efficiency decreases from 86 8 at 10 g min to 57 6 at 75 g min and the gas yield of h2 and ch4 decreases from 8 6 mol kg 18 2 mol kg to 2 6 mol kg 11 8 mol kg respectively the feeding flow rate also has a certain influence on the gas fraction the gas fraction of h2 and n2 decreases while that of ch4 increases from 27 0 to 43 1 in comparison the feeding flow rate of 30 g min was selected for the next experiment in consideration of the ce and the gas fraction of h2 and ch4 3 4 effect of feedstock concentration the feedstock concentration will affect the efficiency of the experiment and the degree of gasification low feedstock concentration will result in inefficiency of the experiment meaning that the processing cost per unit of feedstock will increase high feedstock concentration will lead to incomplete gasification as well as fail to maximize the realization of resource utilization in addition there are reports 14 that the feedstock concentration will affect the product distribution therefore it is necessary to investigate the suitable feedstock concentration the experimental conditions were 500 c 23 mpa feeding flow rate of 30 g min the influence of feedstock concentration on gasification of mmh in supercritical water is shown in fig 5 all three indicators ce h2 and ch4 yield tends to decrease as increasing the concentration of feedstock from 77 3 10 4 mol kg 16 3 mol kg to 67 4 6 4 mol kg 13 9 mol kg respectively indicating that the concentration of feedstock is also an important parameter affecting gasification effect generally speaking the chemical reaction rate is mainly controlled by physical process such as heat and mass transfer and chemical process in which temperature and reactant concentration are the two most important factors the heat and mass transfer could be enhanced by using the spiral reactor 38 and under certain temperature the concentration of feedstock is the only important variable parameter from the micro perspective the difference in concentration means the water wrapped around the reactants is dissimilar therefore effective collision probability is higher between them and then promote their reactions the gas fraction of ch4 increases from 33 6 to 40 6 and h2 decreases from 21 3 to 18 6 illustrating that the existing hydrogen radical in supercritical water is preferentially to attack the methyl forming methane the existing of co at higher concentration is probably due to the reverse reaction of the methanation reaction it is reported 51 52 that the addition of basic catalyst could enhance the water gas shift reaction and conducive to the removal of ammonia nitrogen so it is very necessary to explore the effect of different basic catalysts before deamination and catalytic gasification we need to select the suitable feedstock concentration based on the results obtained feedstock concentration of 10 was selected for the next experiment considering the relatively high ce and gas yield in addition excessive concentration of mmh is not suitable for experiments due to its toxicity 3 5 effect of catalyst in this section we used four basic catalysts koh naoh k2co3 and na2co3 supercritical water is an effective medium for base catalyzed reactions of organic compounds 31 the experimental conditions were 500 c the feeding flow rate was 30 g min and the feedstock concentration was 10 the mass ratio of catalyst to mmh was 1 5 the advantage of homogeneous catalyst is that it can eliminate the resistance of the physical transfer process e g diffusion process the influence of catalyst on gasification of mmh in supercritical water is shown in fig 6 different gasification indicators vary with the type of catalyst ce increases with the addition of koh and naoh while the addition of k2co3 and na2co3 results in a decrease in it it is worth noting that the addition of koh can make ce nearly 100 by comparison it is found that oh can promote ce more than co3 2 and the effect of k is better than that of na the addition of all four catalysts can promote the increase of h2 yield wherein koh has the best effect the yield of h2 can be increased from 8 7 mol kg to 21 6 mol kg increasing by 148 3 ch4 yield increases with the addition of koh and naoh and the addition of k2co3 and na2co3 results in a decrease in it catalyst also has a certain influence on the gas fraction and the common feature of adding different catalysts is that co and c2h6 are not present in the gas production compared with the case without catalyst gas fraction of h2 could be increased and that of ch4 could be decreased with the addition of four catalysts gas production also could be increased with the addition of catalyst among which koh has the optimal effect by comparing the gasification effect of four catalysts on mmh in supercritical water koh can achieve the best effect in terms of ce gas yield and gas production it has been generally accepted that water gas shift reaction can be accelerated by alkali metal 14 41 49 51 which can explain the decline of co and the increase of h2 3 6 migration of carbon and nitrogen element in the experiment we collected both gas products and residual liquid for analysis since carbon and nitrogen are the two most important elements in the study their migration attaches great importance for further research carbon migration of mmh gasification in supercritical water is shown in table 3 all carbon equilibria can be over 96 as can be seen from the table with the increase of temperature carbon in the residual liquid becomes less with the decrease of the total carbon in the residual liquid organic and inorganic carbon show a certain rule with the increase of temperature the percentage of organic carbon in the total carbon gradually decreased while that of inorganic carbon gradually increased this suggests that higher temperatures have a greater effect on organic carbon which can be converted into gas or inorganic carbon at the same time it can be found that the higher the ce the lower the proportion of organic carbon in the total carbon in the residual liquid likewise similar laws can be found in experiments with different feeding flow rate and feedstock concentration the influence of catalyst on carbon migration of mmh gasification in supercritical water is shown in table 4 as can be seen from the table the type of catalyst has a great influence on the proportion of the gasified carbon as for the total carbon remaining in the liquid they have little influence on the migration of organic carbon and inorganic carbon both accounting for about 50 the migration of nitrogen in the gasification of mmh in supercritical water is shown in table 5 in our previous article 42 it has been proved that in the supercritical water environment there are no nitrate ions or nitrite ions in the reaction residue nitrogen is in the form of nitrogen in the gas and in the form of organic nitrogen and ammonia in the liquid this idea is also supported in literature 6 although the total nitrogen remaining in the liquid and organic nitrogen in the table are calculated by difference subtraction certain rules can be obtained from the table similar to the carbon migration the percentage of organic nitrogen in the residual liquid decreases with the increase of temperature this means that as the temperature increases more organic nitrogen will transform to gas or remain in the residual liquid as ammonia nitrogen similar laws can be found in experiments with different feeding flow rate and feedstock concentration the influence of catalyst on nitrogen migration of mmh gasification in supercritical water is shown in table 6 as can be seen from the table different types of catalysts lead to different contents of gasified nitrogen and total nitrogen remaining in the liquid type of catalyst has a great influence on the migration of organic nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen in the residual liquid among them koh naoh and k2co3 can make the ammonia nitrogen content in residual liquid reach more than 90 and only contain a small amount of organic nitrogen the residual liquid using n2co3 contains about half of organic nitrogen and half of ammonia nitrogen 4 conclusion in this paper gasification of mmh in supercritical water is conducted in a spiral continuous reactor non catalytic gasification catalytic gasification and deamination were systematically studied in the range of 450 c 550 c with multiple feeding flow rates feedstock concentrations catalysts and oxidant concentrations the migration of carbon and nitrogen was also investigated under these conditions here are the main conclusions 1 temperature is the most important factor affecting mmh gasification effect in supercritical water h2 co ch4 c2h6 and n2 are the main gaseous products the gas yield and gas fraction of h2 can reach 12 5 mol kg and 25 respectively at 550 c 23 mpa feeding flow rate of 30 g min feedstock concentration of 10 2 ce could reach 100 with the addition of koh mass ratio of koh to mmh was 1 5 under the condition of 500 c 23 mpa feeding flow rate of 30 g min feedstock concentration of 10 where the gas yield and gas fraction of h2 can reach 21 6 mol kg and 31 5 respectively the addition of koh can achieve the best effect in terms of ce gas yield and gas production 3 99 7 wt nitrogen could be gasified at 500 c 23 mpa feeding flow rate of 30 g min feedstock concentration of 5 4 carbon remained in the residual liquid tends to decrease with the increase of temperature meanwhile the proportion of organic carbon in total carbon also has a decrease tendency the addition of koh naoh and k2co3 can make the ammonia nitrogen content in residual liquid reach more than 90 and only contain a small amount of organic nitrogen declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

38 proposed a spiral reactor designed for biodiesel production under supercritical conditions the spiral reactor turned triglyceride and ethanol into fattyacid ethyl ester and glycerol through transesterification the migration of carbon and nitrogen in supercritical water has been studied by many researchers liu 40 has done a lot of work in studying the mechanism of nitrogen migration they found that after indole reacts in supercritical water the gas phase product does not contain nitrogen containing substances and the nitrogen in the residual liquid is in the form of ammonia nitrogen chen 41 paid attention to the carbon distribution of sewage sludge in supercritical water under different conditions in previous studies most attempts to dispose udmh wastewater are attached with various obstacles such as secondary pollution and limit to experimental stage in this paper study on gasification of methylhydrazine mmh in supercritical water was implemented in spiral continuous system to enhance heat and mass transfer mmh was used as model compound on account of similarity of their structure and udmh s commercial unavailability the effect of several parameters including temperature 450 550 c feeding flow rate 10 75 g min feeding concentration 5 30 and catalyst type on gasification were systematically investigated in addition the migration of carbon and nitrogen was also conducted 2 experiment 2 1 apparatus and methods the kinetic parameters of mmh degraded in supercritical water were obtained using a quartz tube reactor to eliminate the potential possibility of catalytic effect imposed by metal wall the detailed procedure could be refer to the reference 42 a spiral tube reaction system suitable for udmh was designed according to the gasification characteristics of it mmh was used as model compound due to udmh s commercial unavailability the schematic diagram of the system is shown in fig 1 the reactor was designed for temperature up to 650 c and pressure up to 30 mpa and was made of 316 stainless steel i d 7 mm o d 14 mm length 12000 mm the temperature of fluid was measured by armored thermocouple and the pressure of the system was regulated by a back pressure valve with a deviation of 0 5 mpa the specific operation steps of the system is as follow after the feedstock and water are mixed in a certain proportion they are added into the feedstock storage tank start the system when the pressure is stable turn on the preheater and heat up the system when the temperature of the system reaches the experimental requirements water and feedstock are driven into the reactor in this way the feedstock driven into the reactor can reach the target temperature as soon as possible and reduce the side reaction the feedstock is first gasified in the gasification section of the reactor after part of heat is transferred to the preheater through the heat exchanger the gas is separated in the high pressure gas liquid separator and sampled for testing the remaining liquid continues to enter the ammonia nitrogen removal section after that the residual liquid passes the back pressure valve to release the pressure to atmospheric pressure and then the final liquid is sampled from the low pressure gas liquid separator and tested we have conducted a large number of experiments and found that in this experimental system the gas production and the content of organic components in residual liquid can reach a stable level after 10 min of feeding therefore in order to improve the experimental efficiency and accuracy online changing variables method were employed in this paper the following expressions are used to evaluate the gasification results 1 c e t h e m a s s o f c a r b o n i n g a s e o u s p r o d u c t s t h

composition was detected by agilent 7890a gas chromatograph gc equipped with a thermal conductivity detector tcd and capillary column c 2000 purchased from lanzhou institute of chemical physics in china the carrier gas is argon 99 999 with a flow rate of 5 ml min a standard gas mixture of h2 co co2 ch4 c2h4 and c2h6 was used for calibration the quantitative analysis of nitrogen was measured by

ammonia nitrogen concentration was detected with rb 103a ammonia nitrogen analyzer nitrate and nitrite concentration were measured by metrohm 930 compact ic flex the total organic carbon toc of the residual liquid was determined by elementar vario toc the quantitative analysis of mmh was measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc equipped with an ultraviolet detector waters2695 2996 3 results and discussion 3 1 measurement and comparison of reaction kinetic parameters the determination of chemical reaction kinetic parameters together with thermodynamic characteristics plays a vital role in designing of the reactor according to thermodynamic calculations the reaction of mmh in supercritical water is an endothermic reaction so the fluid should be continuously supplied with heat to maintain the reaction temperature in order to eliminate the influence of reaction products on the determination of reaction order the initial rate method was employed quartz tube provides non catalytic condition for the reaction of mmh in supercritical water which makes the results reflect the essence of the reaction different concentrations 5 wt 10 wt 20 wt of mmh were reacted under 450 c 23 mpa to determine the order of the reaction based on that fit the corresponding reaction rate constants at different temperatures and then determine the activation energy and pre exponential factor through arrhenius formula we use the slope between the concentration of raw material and that of mmh after one minute s reaction to approximate its initial degradation rate in supercritical water as shown in fig 2 a a few points should be noted during the experiment and calculation reactants added become homogeneous phase in supercritical water filled with quartz tube so the volume of the quartz tube acts as reaction volume when calculating the reactant concentration the amount of water added must ensure that the reactants are in supercritical state before or after the reaction the pressure calculation is obtained through one to one correspondence between water density and pressure under different conditions the reaction rate equation of mmh in supercritical water can be expressed as 4 ν d c m m h d t k m m h n a w a t e r n b where k is reaction rate constant x is concentration of different reactants nx is the reaction order of different reactants n na nb is the total reaction order because water is always in excess during the reaction so eq 4 could be re expressed as 5 ν d c m m h d t k m m h n a where k k w a t e r n b therefore the calculated reaction order and activation energy are both apparent values based on the above analysis and the data obtained as shown in fig 2 we obtained the reaction order and kinetic parameters through the following steps first the reaction order is obtained by the initial rate method through fitting under the condition of 450 c then calculate the reaction constants at different temperatures and obtain the activation energy and pre exponential factor through arrhenius formula table 2 gives the kinetic parameters of mmh degraded in supercritical water the reaction order is generally an integer so the reaction is determined to be apparent first order the activation energy can reflect the degree of difficulty of chemical reactions under certain conditions by comparison with other different reactants as shown in table 2 the activation energy for mmh is much lower than others meaning that mmh is easily degradable in supercritical water according to the above analysis of thermodynamics and kinetics four temperatures of 450 c 480 c 520 c and 550 c were selected for the experiment in the spiral tube continuous reactor the experimental conditions were as follow 23 mpa the ratio of water inlet flow to feedstock flow was 90 to 30 3 2 effect of temperature the influence of temperature on gasification of mmh in supercritical water is shown in fig 3 the main gaseous products are h2 co ch4 c2h6 and n2 among which h2 ch4 and n2 account for the main part it can be seen from the figure that temperature has the most obvious effect on ce from 62 at 450 c to 82 at 550 c increasing by 32 the gas production shown in fig 3 c is the gas production per 20 min in the case of steady gas production it also increases from 25 l to 37 l showing a steady growth trend it is worth noting that the gas yield of h2 increased from 4 0 mol kg at 450 c to 12 5 mol kg at 550 c increasing by 212 2 while the h2 gasification efficiency increased from 46 8 at 450 c to 72 9 at 550 c increasing by 55 8 indicating that more water may be involved in the reaction at high temperature temperature also has a certain effect on the gas fraction as temperature increases the gas fraction of n2 and ch4 has a decline tendency while that of h2 increases observably in addition elementary reactions with different activation energies have different sensitivity to temperature 49 so the directional control of the product can be achieved by changing the temperature once entered into the reactor mmh could undergo pyrolysis or steam reforming which are both endothermic reactions as a result the increase of temperature could enhance the degradation of mmh and thus produce more gaseous products water gas shift reaction and methanation are regarded as two main reactions among gaseous products in scwg the reaction equations and their thermodynamic data are shown in supplementary equations 1 3 and table 2 the elevated temperature will cause the equilibrium to move to the left and the equilibrium constant to decrease but the reduction levels are different obviously the increase in temperature makes the equilibrium constant of methanation change more therefore methane has a tendency to decrease and hydrogen tends to increase in terms of gas fraction on the other hand the increased temperature could also promote the degradation of mmh and further improve the hydrogen production as for the increase of methane production it could be explained by the abundance of hydrogen radical with the increase of temperature ch4 is possibly mainly formed by free radical reactions 50 through capture of the methyl attached to nitrogen in brief the increase of temperature could promote the gas production and change the gas composition through its impact on different reactions and the increase rate of hydrogen is higher than methane ce and nitrogen production also have a increase tendency whose distribution rule will be discussed in later sections still the gasification performance has a room for improvement so other parameters such as feeding flow rate feedstock concentration and the effect of catalyst need optimizing 3 3 effect of feeding flow rate the residence time of the reactants in the reactor is different along with the difference of the feeding flow rate if the feeding flow rate is too low the efficiency of processing the material per unit time will be reduced and energy will also be wasted if the feeding flow rate is too high the residence time of the feedstock in the reactor will be insufficient thus the feedstock will be discharged from the reactor without complete reaction this will not only fail to make full use of the chemical energy in the feedstock but also cause the organic compounds in the residual liquid to exceed the emission standard and cause pollution to the environment therefore it is necessary to explore a suitable feeding flow rate to maximize the benefits of the reactor the experimental conditions were 500 c 23 mpa feedstock concentration of 10 the operation process is roughly the same as the previous one the only difference is that during the 30 min of water flow there is no need to change the system temperature just adjust the flow rate of the feed pump to the required rate the influence of feeding flow rate on gasification of mmh in supercritical water is shown in fig 4 as it can be seen although the gas production increases from 19 l at 10 g min to 55 l at 75 g min all three indicators decreases with the increase of the feeding flow rate carbon gasification efficiency decreases from 86 8 at 10 g min to 57 6 at 75 g min and the gas yield of h2 and ch4 decreases from 8 6 mol kg 18 2 mol kg to 2 6 mol kg 11 8 mol kg respectively the feeding flow rate also has a certain influence on the gas fraction the gas fraction of h2 and n2 decreases while that of ch4 increases from 27 0 to 43 1 in comparison the feeding flow rate of 30 g min was selected for the next experiment in consideration of the ce and the gas fraction of h2 and ch4 3 4 effect of feedstock concentration the feedstock concentration will affect the efficiency of the experiment and the degree of gasification low feedstock concentration will result in inefficiency of the experiment meaning that the processing cost per unit of feedstock will increase high feedstock concentration will lead to incomplete gasification as well as fail to maximize the realization of resource utilization in addition there are reports 14 that the feedstock concentration will affect the product distribution therefore it is necessary to investigate the suitable feedstock concentration the experimental conditions were 500 c 23 mpa feeding flow rate of 30 g min the influence of feedstock concentration on gasification of mmh in supercritical water is shown in fig 5 all three indicators ce h2 and ch4 yield tends to decrease as increasing the concentration of feedstock from 77 3 10 4 mol kg 16 3 mol kg to 67 4 6 4 mol kg 13 9 mol kg respectively indicating that the concentration of feedstock is also an important parameter affecting gasification effect generally speaking the chemical reaction rate is mainly controlled by physical process such as heat and mass transfer and chemical process in which temperature and reactant concentration are the two most important factors the heat and mass transfer could be enhanced by using the spiral reactor 38 and under certain temperature the concentration of feedstock is the only important variable parameter from the micro perspective the difference in concentration means the water wrapped around the reactants is dissimilar therefore effective collision probability is higher between them and then promote their reactions the gas fraction of ch4 increases from 33 6 to 40 6 and h2 decreases from 21 3 to 18 6 illustrating that the existing hydrogen radical in supercritical water is preferentially to attack the methyl forming methane the existing of co at higher concentration is probably due to the reverse reaction of the methanation reaction it is reported 51 52 that the addition of basic catalyst could enhance the water gas shift reaction and conducive to the removal of ammonia nitrogen so it is very necessary to explore the effect of different basic catalysts before deamination and catalytic gasification we need to select the suitable feedstock concentration based on the results obtained feedstock concentration of 10 was selected for the next experiment considering the relatively high ce and gas yield in addition excessive concentration of mmh is not suitable for experiments due to its toxicity 3 5 effect of catalyst in this section we used four basic catalysts koh naoh k2co3 and na2co3 supercritical water is an effective medium for base catalyzed reactions of organic compounds 31 the experimental conditions were 500 c the feeding flow rate was 30 g min and the feedstock concentration was 10 the mass ratio of catalyst to mmh was 1 5 the advantage of homogeneous catalyst is that it can eliminate the resistance of the physical transfer process e g diffusion process the influence of catalyst on gasification of mmh in supercritical water is shown in fig 6 different gasification indicators vary with the type of catalyst ce increases with the addition of koh and naoh while the addition of k2co3 and na2co3 results in a decrease in it it is worth noting that the addition of koh can make ce nearly 100 by comparison it is found that oh can promote ce more than co3 2 and the effect of k is better than that of na the addition of all four catalysts can promote the increase of h2 yield wherein koh has the best effect the yield of h2 can be increased from 8 7 mol kg to 21 6 mol kg increasing by 148 3 ch4 yield increases with the addition of koh and naoh and the addition of k2co3 and na2co3 results in a decrease in it catalyst also has a certain influence on the gas fraction and the common feature of adding different catalysts is that co and c2h6 are not present in the gas production compared with the case without catalyst gas fraction of h2 could be increased and that of ch4 could be decreased with the addition of four catalysts gas production also could be increased with the addition of catalyst among which koh has the optimal effect by comparing the gasification effect of four catalysts on mmh in supercritical water koh can achieve the best effect in terms of ce gas yield and gas production it has been generally accepted that water gas shift reaction can be accelerated by alkali metal 14 41 49 51 which can explain the decline of co and the increase of h2 3 6 migration of carbon and nitrogen element in the experiment we collected both gas products and residual liquid for analysis since carbon and nitrogen are the two most important elements in the study their migration attaches great importance for further research carbon migration of mmh gasification in supercritical water is shown in table 3 all carbon equilibria can be over 96 as can be seen from the table with the increase of temperature carbon in the residual liquid becomes less with the decrease of the total carbon in the residual liquid organic and inorganic carbon show a certain rule with the increase of temperature the percentage of organic carbon in the total carbon gradually decreased while that of inorganic carbon gradually increased this suggests that higher temperatures have a greater effect on organic carbon which can be converted into gas or inorganic carbon at the same time it can be found that the higher the ce the lower the proportion of organic carbon in the total carbon in the residual liquid likewise similar laws can be found in experiments with different feeding flow rate and feedstock concentration the influence of catalyst on carbon migration of mmh gasification in supercritical water is shown in table 4 as can be seen from the table the type of catalyst has a great influence on the proportion of the gasified carbon as for the total carbon remaining in the liquid they have little influence on the migration of organic carbon and inorganic carbon both accounting for about 50 the migration of nitrogen in the gasification of mmh in supercritical water is shown in table 5 in our previous article 42 it has been proved that in the supercritical water environment there are no nitrate ions or nitrite ions in the reaction residue nitrogen is in the form of nitrogen in the gas and in the form of organic nitrogen and ammonia in the liquid this idea is also supported in literature 6 although the total nitrogen remaining in the liquid and organic nitrogen in the table are calculated by difference subtraction certain rules can be obtained from the table similar to the carbon migration the percentage of organic nitrogen in the residual liquid decreases with the increase of temperature this means that as the temperature increases more organic nitrogen will transform to gas or remain in the residual liquid as ammonia nitrogen similar laws can be found in experiments with different feeding flow rate and feedstock concentration the influence of catalyst on nitrogen migration of mmh gasification in supercritical water is shown in table 6 as can be seen from the table different types of catalysts lead to different contents of gasified nitrogen and total nitrogen remaining in the liquid type of catalyst has a great influence on the migration of organic nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen in the residual liquid among them koh naoh and k2co3 can make the ammonia nitrogen content in residual liquid reach more than 90 and only contain a small amount of organic nitrogen the residual liquid using n2co3 contains about half of organic nitrogen and half of ammonia nitrogen 4 conclusion in this paper gasification of mmh in supercritical water is conducted in a spiral continuous reactor non catalytic gasification catalytic gasification and deamination were systematically studied in the range of 450 c 550 c with multiple feeding flow rates feedstock concentrations catalysts and oxidant concentrations the migration of carbon and nitrogen was also investigated under these conditions here are the main conclusions 1 temperature is the most important factor affecting mmh gasification effect in supercritical water h2 co ch4 c2h6 and n2 are the main gaseous products the gas yield and gas fraction of h2 can reach 12 5 mol kg and 25 respectively at 550 c 23 mpa feeding flow rate of 30 g min feedstock concentration of 10 2 ce could reach 100 with the addition of koh mass ratio of koh to mmh was 1 5 under the condition of 500 c 23 mpa feeding flow rate of 30 g min feedstock concentration of 10 where the gas yield and gas fraction of h2 can reach 21 6 mol kg and 31 5 respectively the addition of koh can achieve the best effect in terms of ce gas yield and gas production 3 99 7 wt nitrogen could be gasified at 500 c 23 mpa feeding flow rate of 30 g min feedstock concentration of 5 4 carbon remained in the residual liquid tends to decrease with the increase of temperature meanwhile the proportion of organic carbon in total carbon also has a decrease tendency the addition of koh naoh and k2co3 can make the ammonia nitrogen content in residual liquid reach more than 90 and only contain a small amount of organic nitrogen declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

13483,ags technology has been studied for decades and many successful experimental research approaches and full scale processes have been proposed however a precise comprehensive understanding of the granulation mechanism remains lacking in this study sequencing batch reactors were partially inoculated with s1 or without ags s2 to explore aerobic granulation performance in simulative low strength wastewater the cod nh4 n removal efficiency and snd rate were 91 61 92 47 and 84 respectively in s1 and higher in this reactor than in s2 86 76 85 21 and 75 respectively indicating the superiority of partial inoculation with ags the ratios of p release naac uptake both increased to nearly 0 250 revealing the robust capacity for phosphorus enrichment moreover the increment of eps content in s2 31 73 mg g mlss was 47 higher than that in s1 21 54 mg g mlss and was contributed mainly by ps which increased to 30 17 mg g mlss s2 these findings indicated active sludge for granulation was more sensitive to the ambient conditions and secrete greater ps ftir and 3d eem revealed that numerous hydroxyl groups were assembled within eps upon granulation and humic acid like substances first increased and then decreased over the operation implying robust cohesion and positive microbial activities microbial community analysis demonstrated that paracoccus and unclassified cytophagales

microbial metabolism cellular processes and signaling pathways such as methanol oxidation methylotrophy and nitrite denitrification pathways keywords ags removal efficiency eps microbial community metabolic pathways 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge ags a promising wastewater treatment technology has been investigated for several decades and possesses the advantages of a high settling velocity tolerance to high toxicity and simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal 1 to date a few aerobic granular projects from nereda have been developed with high pollutant removal performance and low capital input 2 3 researchers have suggested that the application of ags instead of conventional activated sludge in wastewater treatment plants could reduce the energy consumed by 68 2 studies have confirmed the potential and value of this technology for future wastewater treatment unfortunately to apply this promising technology to real wastewater treatment it is crucial to shorten the sludge granulation time which remains an intractable problem 4 some methods to reduce the granulation time have been proposed including seeding with partially granular sludge 5 7 pijuan et al 8 added crushed granules to systems achieving a shortest granulation time of 18 days which is shorter than the typical granulation time of approximately 70 days 4 additionally the addition of granular sludge has been found to greatly increase the number of functional genes and nutrient removal efficiency over those achieved with active sludge during the start up operation 9 by splitting partially granular sludge into smaller granules and dispersing them throughout the reactor the physical attachment of flocs to granules within the system can be enhanced avoiding aggressive biomass loss and thereby maintaining a superior biological nitrogen removal efficiency of 82 93 during the granulation process 7 thus pending detailed investigation of the underlying mechanism this method should be optimized and applied the granulation achieved by ags inoculation is influenced by an array of external factors including dissolved oxygen do do has distinct effects on pollutant removal and microbial assemblages within granules researchers have typically aerated the reactor at a high rate to facilitate granulation 10 11 this aeration could lead to a high do concentration around the granular sludge and thereby affect the growth of functional organisms and the construction of the granule backbone 6 a high do concentration may not only affect the spatial distribution of ammonium and nitrite oxidizing bacteria but also favor the start up of nitration with ags 12 moreover high do can ensure thorough organic carbon removal and it results in a heterotrophic metabolism advantage over ammonification nitrification 13 increasing do from 4 to 6 mg l can double the phosphorus content of biomass 14 interestingly previous studies have shown notable benefits of operation under high do however the systematic exploration of the combination of partly granular sludge inoculation and high do concentration for aerobic granulation was a knowledge gap in this study inoculation with active sludge or partially granular sludge was implemented with high do in laboratory scale sequencing batch reactors sbrs we aimed to investigate the differences between inoculation with and without partial ags during granulation in i the variations of sludge properties and relative contents and the composition of extracellular polymers ii nutrient removal efficiency in full performance and dynamic degradation and iii the evolution of microbial community structure and we analyzed the metabolic pathways involved in the above macroscopic phenomena 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor configurations and operation strategies two aerobic granular sbrs designated s1 inoculated with active sludge and ags at approximately a quarter volume and s2 normal cultivation inoculated with active sludge were each configured with an inner diameter of 100 mm and a height of 600 mm creating a working volume of 4 0 l fig s1 a synthetic wastewater was pumped into each reactor with an exchange ratio of 50 2 l a mechanical stirrer was operated at a constant speed of 300 rpm in the feeding and anaerobic phases but was stopped in the settling and discharge periods air was introduced from the bottom of the reactor with a blast blower through an aerator meter at a constant aeration rate of 0 16 m3 h equivalent to a surface velocity of 0 6 cm s producing a do of approximately 8 mg l during aeration fig s1b each sbr was operated in anaerobic aerobic mode for simultaneous nitrification denitrification and phosphorus removal each cycle spanned 4 h and included 5 min of feeding 60 min of anaerobic phase 155 min of oxic phase 5 min of settling and 5 min of discharge 2 2 feeding in this study the granulation of conventional activated sludge was performed in the sbrs to investigate chemical oxygen demand cod nitrogen and phosphorus removal from low strength wastewater with an organic load rate of 1 0 1 4 kg cod m3 day the reactors were inoculated with 2 4 mixed liquor suspended solid mlss g l

the large variation of real wastewater 15 the composition of the wastewater is presented in table s1 the ph of the influent wastewater was adjusted to 7 5 using hydrochloric acid hcl or sodium hydroxide naoh solution 2 3 analytical procedures the parameters of the influent and effluent water were monitored including the cod nitrogen and phosphorus removal which were all determined according to standard methods set by china s state environmental protection administration sepa 16 state environmental protection administration of china sepa 2002 nh4 n nitrite no2 n and nitrate no3 n were summed as total inorganic nitrogen tin an sj 3f ph meter and an sx816 do meter were used to detect ph and do the attributes of sludge including the settling volume index at 5 min svi5min mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss and specific oxygen uptake rate sour were determined according to the methods of 17 the morphology of the sludge was observed through a digital camera and sem particle size was determined by using a mastersizer 3000 instrument water samples collected from the reactor were all pretreated with a 0 45 μm filter membrane and then used for detection simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd efficiency was calculated using eq 1 18 1 snd nh 4 n inf no x n acc nh 4 n inf where nh4 ninf is the influent ammonia at the beginning of the aerobic phase and nox nacc is the sum of no2 n and no3 n at the end of the aerobic phase 2 4 extracellular polymeric substance eps extraction and analysis eps was extracted from the granular sludge with a heat method 5 and the only difference was heating at 80 c for 60 min after filtration with 0 45 μm water filter membrane the supernatant was collected for protein pn and polysaccharide ps analysis and three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem analysis was used to characterize the composition of the extracted eps pn was determined by the bradford method and ps was determined with a sulfuric acid anthrone colorimetric method eps was regarded as the sum of pn and ps 2 5 microorganism community analysis to identify the microbial community dynamics at different stages granular sludge samples were

operational taxonomic unit otu cluster analysis and taxonomic analysis were subsequently performed the raw sequencing data were uploaded to the ncbi database under accession number prjna706168 3 results 3 1 ags formation and properties considering the performances of the reactors the granulation process was divided into three phases accommodation formation and stabilization the characteristics of aerobic granules were determined every 5 days and the data are shown in table s2 the average mlss values of s1 and s2 were 838 504 and 1174 623 mg l respectively in the accommodation period and increased to 1079 16 and 1911 27 7 mg l respectively in the stabilization period sv5min and svi5min appeared more stable in s1 than in s2 with sv5min remaining at 18 svi5min approached 166 20 ml g in s1 but was lower in s2 reaching 94 10 3 ml g sour represents the aerobic metabolism ability of microorganisms it maintained a level of approximately 31 96 mg o2 g mlss h

sludge particle size and indicates that the two reactors exhibited similar sizes of preliminary cultivated particles fig 1 shows a microscopic view of the sludge the sludge on day 50 exhibited granulation and flattening caused by dehydration filamentous bacteria proliferated in the initial phase and were densely amassed 3 2 overall performance in c n and p removal fig 2 depicts the removal performances of both anoxic oxic a o systems during the aerobic granulation process based on the data from day 70 over the entire process the average influent cod nh4 n and tp concentrations were 426

stabilization period the performance of s1 was superior to that of s2 during the accommodation and formation periods in s2 the pollutant removal efficiencies strongly fluctuated but when s1 and s2 entered the stabilization period after granulation s2 showed a greater improvement than s1 in pollutant removal the cod and nh4 n concentrations of the final effluent from the two reactors were lower than 30 and 1 mg l respectively while the average effluent tp values in s1 and s2 were 0 78 and 0 12 mg l respectively 3 3 dynamic performance in c n and p removal over different phases in a typical cycle fig 3 presents the cycle performances during the different phases which were analyzed to investigate the mechanisms of cod nitrogen and phosphorus removal the degradation rate and time to equilibrium of cod and nh4 n gradually improved throughout the process but the final equilibrium time point of degradation was mostly concentrated at 120 min and s1 possessed better metabolism than s2 with respect to cod and nh4 n nitrite underwent similar accumulation processes in the two reactors yet s2 exhibited higher accumulation with a concentration of 8 57 mg l regarding the variation in nitrate accumulation compared with s2 s1 showed a lower effluent concentration and higher nitrogen removal on day 70 and the nitrate content of the effluent in both reactors was less than 6 mg l table 1 presents the detailed pollution removal parameters for each of the anaerobic and aerobic phases throughout the anaerobic phase the released phosphorus gradually increased the specific po4 p release rate of s1 reached 8 54 0 11 mg p g 1 ss h 1 and was much higher than that of s2 3 17 0 09 mg p g 1 ss1 ss h 1 indicating higher efficiency of the former the ratio of p release naac uptake increased from 0 013 to 0 250 in s1 and from 0 010 to 0 262 in s2 over the formation period however after the granulation of the sludge was complete this ratio increased to 0 274 in s2 and was higher than 0 24 in s1 in the aerobic phase nitrogen variation and phosphorus uptake were the main aspects reflecting relative bioactivity s1 seemed to have advantages over s2 in terms of n removal during the accommodation period the n removal of s1 reached 7 89 0 96 mg l and was higher and more stable than that of s2 3 46 0 2 27 mg l this finding was supported by the denitrification rates of s1 and s2 which were 2 87 0 35 and 1 26 0 76 mg n l 1 h 1 respectively however the nitrification rate remained at a similar level so snd efficiency appears to be a significant parameter for estimating nitrogen removal capacity under aerobic conditions the snd efficiency of s1 increased from 54 to 84 and was greater than that of s2 which increased from 34 to 75 however phosphorus uptake reached 9 72 4 12 and 9 08 0 94 mg l in s1 and s2 respectively and s1 exhibited slightly superior but unstable performance to s2 during the stabilization phase 3 4 characterization of epss in different phases the composition and content of ps and pn in different operation periods are presented fig 4b the amount of eps in both reactors markedly increased between day 30 and day 70 from 36 37 to 57 91 mg g mlss s1 and from 22 63 to 54 34 mg g mlss s2 in particular ps greatly increased from 27 91 to 41 91 mg g mlss in s1 and from 12 54 to 43 01 mg g mlss in s2 in addition a sticky excretion which might have been ps covered the surface of the granules to form a barrier which was confirmed by sem additionally the increase in pn content was more obvious in s1 than s2 with pn increasing from 8 46 to 15 93 mg g mlss in s1 and from 2 43 to 7 21 mg l mlss in s2 overall ps was higher than pn and exhibited a rapid increase in both reactors which directly contributed to the considerable variation in ps pn to reveal the variation in eps eps was characterized by 3d eem at the end of each of the three phases the results are presented in fig 4a the compositions of the fluorescence spectra varied among the different operational periods according to 19 divided 3d eem spectra can provide information regarding four major types of eps i aromatic pn region a ex em 200 250 280 380 ii fulvic acid like region b ex em 200 250 380 440 iii tryptophan and pn like region c ex em 310 340 350 450 and iv humic acid like substances region d ex em 350 365 450 455 the results indicated that aromatic pns fulvic acid like compounds tryptophan and pn like compounds existed throughout the phases and exhibited slight variations in concentration which seemed stronger in s1 than in s2 the humic acid like substances in the reactors presented similar trends with the corresponding fluorescence intensity first increasing in the formation phase and then decreasing in the stabilization period which might signal an intermediate stage of granulation ftir spectra were obtained to examine the transformation of the groups attached to eps and evaluate the differences in a high do environment fig 4c the positions and numbers of ftir peaks for the eps samples at different phases were fully assembled indicating similar chemical ingredients in the eps however the intensity of the respective peaks was observed to strengthen the peak at approximately 3440 cm 1 was ascribed to oh stretching hydrogen bonded 20 and strengthened over time especially in s2 weak absorption at 2925 2974 cm 1 was largely maintained throughout the process and was attributed to the asymmetrical ch stretching vibration of the aliphatic ch2 group 21 which is responsible for the eem characteristics of aromatic pns and fulvic acid like compounds however the bands near 1100 1455 and 1650 cm 1 were related to synthesis of the ch2 group of aliphatic chains nh groups in the presence of pns and co stretching vibrations from carbohydrates and aromatics respectively 22 all of the bands exhibited obvious reinforcement on day 70 especially in region c furthermore compared with s1 s2 exhibited more obvious changes in all functional groups however guibaud et al 23 identified bands at 600 900 cm 1 reflecting the existence of unsaturated bonds which were susceptible to oxidation and response to the rare peak occurrence 3 5 microbial community 3 5 1 bacterial richness and diversity the taxon richness and diversity of the microbial community in different operational phases and under high do concentrations were estimated table s3 fig 5a indicated that the data achieved sufficient sequencing depth fig 5b suggests that microbes occurred in distinct screenings and that different functional bacteria were enriched a venn diagram fig 5c of the full operation based on otus indicated that the majority of microbes were common to both reactors after day 50 and that the systemic microbial structure presented a low transformation rate the sequence tags of the reactors were 34 245 s1 and 51 353 s2 on day 70 and distributed among 403 and 446 otus defined by a 3 distance threshold the ace chao shannon and simpson indices were used to represent bacterial richness and diversity the ace and chao results indicated a reduction in community richness interestingly the indices tended to maintain stable levels suggesting that the bacterial community structure tended to remain approximately uniform across the different processes 3 5 2 bacterial community structure the evolution of bacterial community structure was investigated to explore microbial dynamics samples from s1 and s2 were acquired on days 0 30 50 and 70 during the cultivation process and examined at the phylum class and genus levels a total of 12 phyla were identified fig s3 common wastewater treatment microorganisms include proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria chloroflexi and firmicutes 24 the two most dominant phyla after granulation were proteobacteria and bacteroidetes which accounted for 43 25 and 41 85 respectively s1 and 68 87 and 17 75 respectively s2 of the total phyla however proteobacteria was enriched over the process accounting for 67 43 s1 of phyla on day 70 whereas bacteroidetes declined to 20 08 s1 the dominant microbes in s2 showed subtle changes in abundance with the relative percentage of bacteroidetes increasing to 28 01 nevertheless there were no obvious differences in the sequencing results from day 70 between the different processes class level analysis was performed to deeply investigate the full course from inoculation to granulation fig s4 alphaproteobacteria accumulated over the entire operation increasing from 11 88 to 53 02 s1 and from 18 29 to 50 50 s2 gammaproteobacteria presented different proportions between the two processes accounting for 41 39 s1 and 5 71 s2 of the community at inoculation and ultimately reaching 11 98 s1 and 12 39 s2 gammaproteobacteria abundance appreciably decreased in s1 and increased in s2 moreover cytophagia was enriched during the process representing 15 61 and 23 10 of the community in s1 and s2 respectively at the end of the operation planctomycetia and sphingobacteria presented slight variations over the cultivation process and accounted for low proportions of the total community with relative percentages of 2 59 s1 and 1 74 s2 for planctomycetia and 0 28 s1 and 0 58 s2 for sphingobacteria sequencing analysis was also performed at the genus level to illustrate the evolution of the microbial community at a more detailed level fig 5d a heat map was constructed showing the changes in abundance of the top 45 genera paracoccus unclassified cytophagales unclassified gammaproteobacteria and unclassified bacteroidetes were common and the dominant bacteria on day 70 with percentages of 29 74 10 86 6 08 and 3 12 respectively s1 and 26 61 18 54 10 66 and 4 10 s2 respectively unclassified cytophagales belonging to class cytophagia were enriched in the intermediate stages of both processes and declined thereafter however thiothrix roseibacillus and unclassified rhodocyclaceae seemed to be interim microbes in both processes thiothrix was enriched during the accommodation phase with percentages ranging from 4 48 to 42 46 s1 and from 0 51 to 4 09 s2 from days 0 to 50 as the granules gradually formed the abundance of thiothrix decreased to 4 07 s1 and 0 52 s2 roseibacillus and unclassified rhodocyclaceae had percentages of 1 02 and 2 43 respectively in s1 and 2 29 and 3 52 respectively in s2 at the end of the full operation their highest percentages were 4 49 and 6 97 respectively s1 and 7 03 and 15 61 respectively s2 3 5 3 functional microbes the functional genera are summarized in table 2 and included denitrifying phosphate accumulating organisms dnpaos denitrifying bacteria dnb glycogen accumulating organisms gaos nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and eps producers these genera were studied to further reveal the transformation of the physiological mechanism throughout the operation the different types of inoculation caused obvious differences in the initial abundance of dnb the abundance of dnb in s1 48 51 was higher than that in s2 7 96 although similar abundances were reached after granulation s1 31 02 s2 28 52 the abundance of nob decreased in both reactors and the percentages of dnpaos and gaos increased eps producers had a relative abundance of 29 52 in s2 which was much higher than that in s1 15 49 3 5 4 metabolic pathway analysis with kegg and cog functional differences in metabolic pathways were mapped based on kegg fig s5 and cog fig s6 secondary classification and prediction from gene sequences to elaborate how granule formation affected microbial survival strategies the kegg results were divided into four functional categories namely information storage and processing f h s metabolism b c d g i j p r cellular processes and signaling a e k l m q and poorly characterized n o the functional prediction of metabolism and cellular processes and signaling highlighted advantages suggesting great metabolic activities within the bacteria the cog results readily matched the nutrient metabolic performance twelve main functions including methanol oxidation methylotrophy nitrate denitrification nitrite denitrification nitrous oxide denitrification dark hydrogen oxidation nitrite respiration aerobic chemoheterotrophy nitrate respiration nitrate reduction and photoheterotrophy were considerably improved over the entire operation methanol oxidation and methylotrophy reinforcement were responsible for the influent with sodium acetate alone the prediction of nitrate denitrification nitrite denitrification and nitrous oxide denitrification suggested an improvement in nitric compound removal after granulation which was consistent with the dynamic degradation process however some functions such as aerobic ammonia oxidation aerobic nitrite oxidation and nitrification were reduced in some cases nearly disappearing and then gradually increased after granulation in both reactors although they remained lower than they were in the original samples one engaging phenomenon was that the variations in dark oxidation of sulfur compounds and dark sulfide oxidation detected based on the number of matched genes strongly coincided with the transformation in abundance of thiothrix 4 discussion 4 1 sludge and nutrient transformation over granulation based on the experimental results it can be concluded that the low biomass was due to the short fixed settling time which divided the operation into three phases this settling pattern resulted in rapid loss in biomass in both reactors however such settling can help achieve better setting properties 25 27 svi5min was higher than that reported in other studies 24 11 whereas sv5min gradually decreased over the operation suggesting that excellent settling was achieved the biomass growth in s2 was higher than that in s1 this difference might have been caused by the different inoculations the filamentous bacteria contributed to sludge granulation and their performance was consistent with microbial sequencing results regarding nutrient removal during the operation in the accommodation phase biomass was seriously lost and the activities of various microorganisms were affected by the new environment thus the removal of pollutants decreased with fluctuation in the formation phase the removal of all pollutants steadily and gradually increased verawaty et al 7 noted that after the production of granular sludge the removal rate of nutrients increased and the granulated sludge contributed to the nutrient removal in the stabilization phase removal steadily increased and the removal of all nutrients especially nitrogen and phosphorus appeared to be overtly enhanced over the entire operation the inoculated granular sludge in s1 showed better adaptability than the sludge in s2 the variations in compound concentrations over the different phases of degradation revealed favorable self regulation in both systems the efficiencies of cod and nh4 n removal were enhanced as evidenced by the enhancement of the degradation rate from the formation phase to the stabilization phase especially when nh4 n increased from 0 18 to 0 22 mg min in both reactors the results confirmed that the granular material contributed to nutrient removal 28 the degradation of nitrite and nitrate was probably caused by the inoculation with the partly aerobic granular material which likely provided conditions favorable for bacterial resistance against high do 29 in addition the snd rate illustrated the superiority of inoculation with partially granular sludge the improvement in the ratio of p release naac uptake indicated that phosphorus accumulation was substantially enhanced over the morphological transformation from floc to granular sludge semerci and hasilci 18 found that the fastest rate of p release hac uptake was 0 14 in anaerobic aerobic anoxic modes which is far below our result under high do after granulation the strength of phosphorus release was gradually enhanced in response to accumulating accumulibacter and the rate of p release naac uptake exhibited slight variation which also revealed increased glycogen accumulation li et al 9 suggested that granular sludge with rapid settling features was not readily washed out from the reactor and comprised more complex biotic communities than traditional active sludge which might be attributed to s1 s apparent advantage over s2 in phosphorus release in the initial phase considering the results together it can be concluded that the utilization of partially granular sludge as seed sludge is feasible for the initial operation 4 2 eps variation during granulation eps can improve hydrophobicity and polymeric interactions as well as create bridges between the cells and cages to entrap cells the secretion of eps slightly increased under the high do concentrations in contrast to a previous finding 19 which reinforced the granulation process in granular sludge the secretion of pss as gel forming polymers responsible for the stability of granules was found to increase to maintain the stability of the microbial consortium under high do this capacity is similar to that of pn which has been demonstrated able to react with positively charged ions such as cu ii and fe ii iii 30 31 to protect microorganisms against harsh environments however the large difference in polymers between the reactors might stem from the difference in seed sludge with granular sludge having preferable self protected structural integrity than normal active sludge nevertheless the 3d eem results implied that humic acid like substances may promote aerobic granular formation via functions such as facilitating the proliferation of certain bacteria or the disintegration of organic macromolecules 32 wang et al 11 found that humic acid like substances varied greatly under different cod n ratios and high do concentrations such variation also appeared in this study in chemical groups of eps variation in oh might be a response to increases in components such as humic acid like compounds due to high ambient do since hydroxyl and amino groups can resist a strong oxidizing environment and prevent cell damage which can explain the increase in ps pn furthermore the sludge granulation caused extreme enrichment of the ch ch2 and co groups and inoculation with active sludge could result in the secretion of more chemical compounds however no peaks occurred inside the bands before morphological change under the high do environment they arose only after granulation 4 3 the evolution of microorganisms and the functional prediction results the results in table s2 indicate that s1 presented lower bacterial richness and diversity than s2 the higher simpson index value in s1 was a response to the presence of granular material in the seed sludge cultivated by a sole carbon source as a result of the strong selection pressure from the sedimentary mode and carbon source a majority of the parallel microbial species were conserved leading to an increasingly concentrated microbial distribution regarding the studied phyla proteobacteria can remove some pollutants such as aromatic compounds 33 bacteroidetes is widely regarded as one of the most abundant heterotrophic microbial taxa with the capacity to secrete extracellular polymers and effectively degrade organic matter 34 the large enrichment revealed that proteobacteria was more competitive than bacteroidetes under high do concentrations consistent with the results of 29 regarding the studied classes alphaproteobacteria possesses a strong ability of biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal 35 luo et al 36 suggested that alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria dominated at the beginning of the ags cultivation process to retain effluent quality and were subsequently outnumbered by betaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria is currently the most abundant microbe at the class level 37 however in this study alphaproteobacteria became the dominant taxon this result might have been due to the special environment available to alphaproteobacteria a genus with the ability to secrete abundant extracellular polymers especially at high do concentrations planctomycetia and sphingobacteria can assist ps disintegration heterotrophic metabolism and biological nitrogen removal processes 38 10 and these taxa improved pollutant degradation with respect to the studied genera paracoccus has been identified as a denitrifying phosphorus accumulating bacterium that plays a significant role in low c n wastewater 39 41 and its enrichment over the operation could explain the systematic simultaneous phosphorus nitrogen removal unclassified cytophagales has been identified as group of fermentative bacteria with the capacity to hydrolyze organic compounds to organic acids and co2 under anaerobic conditions 42 43 the variation in the abundance of this genus was similar to that in humic acid like substances which might explain the variation in microbial excretion through microbiology cytophagia also appeared in 11 28 in a high do environment accounting for a considerable percentage of the microbes present unclassified gammaproteobacteria and unclassified bacteroidetes were ascribed to the classes gammaproteobacteria and bacteroidetes and considered to have a uniform function thiothrix is an obligate aerobic mixotroph that frequently appears in enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr systems with good performance 42 and it has been identified as a denitrifying bacterium that enhances nitrogen removal 43 14 thiothrix favored granular formation and structural stabilization and enhanced nutrient removal efficiency in s1 roseibacillus and unclassified rhodocyclaceae are considered denitrifying organisms 44 and exhibited similar abundance changes as thiothrix from the analyses at the phylum class and genus levels it can be concluded that the addition of granular sludge can enhance granulation and pollutant degradation especially in the accommodation period when the sludge was granular in shape it was difficult for the microbial community structure to evolve regarding the functional microbes the abundance of dnbs directly contributed to the initial distinction in nitrogen removal capacity their changing abundance suggested that the external selection pressure was key in determining the final microbial composition the decrease in nobs might have led to weaker nitrate reduction efficiency and therefore nitrite accumulation in the preliminary phase the increase in dnpaos and the existence of gaos followed the enhancement of tp removal and substantial organic metabolism in the anaerobic period as depicted by 18 11 the enrichment of eps producers suggests microbial adaptation to different states such as a high do environment 45 the high richness of eps producers in s2 might be attributable to the susceptibility of the active sludge to the environment functional prediction analysis can provide great insight into the behavior of microorganisms in wastewater treatment processes and is significant for exploring the behavior of microorganisms based on the pns associated with cellular processes and signaling the capacity for nitrogen compound degradation implied that the bacteria were susceptible to environmental variation this phenomenon could explain the low abundance of nobs whereas great nitrite oxidation was achieved suggesting that microbial metabolomics could be applied to determine nitrogen transformation over the granulation process a similar finding was reported by 24 and the present results support his conclusion that the organisms had high bioactivity the kegg and cog analyses indicated that some mechanistic pathways were reinforced which revealed the crucial cellular behaviors expressed to adapt to the new environment methanol oxidation methylotrophy and nitrogen compound metabolism were all intensified in response to the environmental variation however the particular behavior of sulfide metabolism and the proliferation of thiothrix difficultly deduced from the analyses of influent composition and nutrient degradation were coincident in the functional prediction 5 conclusion this research demonstrated that inoculation with ags provided advantages over the use of active sludge for pollutant removal under preliminary operation and that humic pn like substances and oh stretching hydrogen bonded play transitional roles during granulation microbial analysis revealed that paracoccus and unclassified cytophagales were enriched and cellular processes and signaling were strengthened from flocs to granules declaration of competing interest the

13483,ags technology has been studied for decades and many successful experimental research approaches and full scale processes have been proposed however a precise comprehensive understanding of the granulation mechanism remains lacking in this study sequencing batch reactors were partially inoculated with s1 or without ags s2 to explore aerobic granulation performance in simulative low strength wastewater the cod nh4 n removal efficiency and snd rate were 91 61 92 47 and 84 respectively in s1 and higher in this reactor than in s2 86 76 85 21 and 75 respectively indicating the superiority of partial inoculation with ags the ratios of p release naac uptake both increased to nearly 0 250 revealing the robust capacity for phosphorus enrichment moreover the increment of eps content in s2 31 73 mg g mlss was 47 higher than that in s1 21 54 mg g mlss and was contributed mainly by ps which increased to 30 17 mg g mlss s2 these findings indicated active sludge for granulation was more sensitive to the ambient conditions and secrete greater ps ftir and 3d eem revealed that numerous hydroxyl groups were assembled within eps upon granulation and humic acid like substances first increased and then decreased over the operation implying robust cohesion and positive microbial activities microbial community analysis demonstrated that paracoccus and unclassified cytophagales dominated in both reactors accounting for 29 42 and 10 87 respectively of the community in s1 and 26 62 and 18 54 respectively of the community in s2 metabolic pathway analysis revealed enhancement of microbial metabolism cellular processes and signaling pathways such as methanol oxidation methylotrophy and nitrite denitrification pathways keywords ags removal efficiency eps microbial community metabolic pathways 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge ags a promising wastewater treatment technology has been investigated for several decades and possesses the advantages of a high settling velocity tolerance to high toxicity and simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal 1 to date a few aerobic granular projects from nereda have been developed with high pollutant removal performance and low capital input 2 3 researchers have suggested that the application of ags instead of conventional activated sludge in wastewater treatment plants could reduce the energy consumed by 68 2 studies have confirmed the potential and value of this technology for future wastewater treatment unfortunately to apply this promising technology to real wastewater treatment it is crucial to shorten the sludge granulation time which remains an intractable problem 4 some methods to reduce the granulation time have been proposed including seeding with partially granular sludge 5 7 pijuan et al 8 added crushed granules to systems achieving a shortest granulation time of 18 days which is shorter than the typical granulation time of approximately 70 days 4 additionally the addition of granular sludge has been found to greatly increase the number of functional genes and nutrient removal efficiency over those achieved with active sludge during the start up operation 9 by splitting partially granular sludge into smaller granules and dispersing them throughout the reactor the physical attachment of flocs to granules within the system can be enhanced avoiding aggressive biomass loss and thereby maintaining a superior biological nitrogen removal efficiency of 82 93 during the granulation process 7 thus pending detailed investigation of the underlying mechanism this method should be optimized and applied the granulation achieved by ags inoculation is influenced by an array of external factors including dissolved oxygen do do has distinct effects on pollutant removal and microbial assemblages within granules researchers have typically aerated the reactor at a high rate to facilitate granulation 10 11 this aeration could lead to a high do concentration around the granular sludge and thereby affect the growth of functional organisms and the construction of the granule backbone 6 a high do concentration may not only affect the spatial distribution of ammonium and nitrite oxidizing bacteria but also favor the start up of nitration with ags 12 moreover high do can ensure thorough organic carbon removal and it results in a heterotrophic metabolism advantage over ammonification nitrification 13 increasing do from 4 to 6 mg l can double the phosphorus content of biomass 14 interestingly previous studies have shown notable benefits of operation under high do however the systematic exploration of the combination of partly granular sludge inoculation and high do concentration for aerobic granulation was a knowledge gap in this study inoculation with active sludge or partially granular sludge was implemented with high do in laboratory scale sequencing batch reactors sbrs we aimed to investigate the differences between inoculation with and without partial ags during granulation in i the variations of sludge properties and relative contents and the composition of extracellular polymers ii nutrient removal efficiency in full performance and dynamic degradation and iii the evolution of microbial community structure and we analyzed the metabolic pathways involved in the above macroscopic phenomena 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor configurations and operation strategies two aerobic granular sbrs designated s1 inoculated with active sludge and ags at approximately a quarter volume and s2 normal cultivation inoculated with active sludge were each configured with an inner diameter of 100 mm and a height of 600 mm creating a working volume of 4 0 l fig s1 a synthetic wastewater was pumped into each reactor with an exchange ratio of 50 2 l a mechanical stirrer was operated at a constant speed of 300 rpm in the feeding and anaerobic phases but was stopped in the settling and discharge periods air was introduced from the bottom of the reactor with a blast blower through an aerator meter at a constant aeration rate of 0 16 m3 h equivalent to a surface velocity of 0 6 cm s producing a do of approximately 8 mg l during aeration fig s1b each sbr was operated in anaerobic aerobic mode for simultaneous nitrification denitrification and phosphorus removal each cycle spanned 4 h and included 5 min of feeding 60 min of anaerobic phase 155 min of oxic phase 5 min of settling and 5 min of discharge 2 2 feeding in this study the granulation of conventional activated sludge was performed in the sbrs to investigate chemical oxygen

the large variation of real wastewater 15 the composition of the wastewater is presented in table s1 the ph of the influent wastewater was adjusted to 7 5 using hydrochloric acid hcl or sodium hydroxide naoh solution 2 3 analytical procedures the parameters of the influent and effluent water were monitored including the cod nitrogen and phosphorus removal which were all determined according to standard methods set by china s state environmental protection administration sepa 16 state environmental protection administration of china sepa 2002 nh4 n nitrite no2 n and nitrate no3 n were summed as total inorganic nitrogen tin an sj 3f ph meter and an sx816 do meter were used to detect ph and do the attributes of sludge including the settling volume index at 5 min svi5min mlss mixed

particle size was determined by using a mastersizer 3000 instrument water samples collected from the reactor were all pretreated with a 0 45 μm filter membrane and then used for detection simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd efficiency was calculated using eq 1 18 1 snd nh 4 n inf no x n acc nh 4 n inf where nh4 ninf is the influent ammonia at the beginning of the aerobic phase and nox nacc is the sum of no2 n and no3 n at the end of the aerobic phase 2 4 extracellular polymeric substance eps extraction and analysis eps was extracted from the granular sludge with a heat method 5 and the only difference was heating at 80 c for 60 min after filtration with 0 45 μm water filter membrane the supernatant was collected for protein pn and polysaccharide ps analysis and three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem analysis was used to characterize the composition of the extracted eps pn was determined by the bradford method and ps was determined with a sulfuric acid anthrone colorimetric method eps was regarded as the sum of pn and ps 2 5 microorganism community analysis to identify the microbial community dynamics at different stages granular sludge samples were collected from reactors s1 and s2 on days 0 30 50 and 70 denoted s1 a s2 a s1 b s2 b s1 d s2 d and s1 e s2 e respectively dna extraction pcr amplification and pyrosequencing were conducted

operational taxonomic unit otu cluster analysis and taxonomic analysis were subsequently performed the raw sequencing data were uploaded to the ncbi database under accession number prjna706168 3 results 3 1 ags formation and properties considering the performances of the reactors the granulation process was divided into three phases accommodation formation and stabilization the characteristics of aerobic granules were determined every 5 days and the data are shown in table s2 the average mlss values of s1 and s2 were 838 504 and 1174 623 mg l respectively in the accommodation period and increased to 1079 16 and 1911 27 7 mg l respectively in the stabilization period sv5min and svi5min appeared more stable in s1 than in s2 with sv5min remaining at 18 svi5min approached 166 20 ml g in s1 but was lower in s2 reaching 94 10 3 ml g sour represents the aerobic metabolism ability of microorganisms it maintained a level of approximately 31 96 mg o2 g mlss h however in the stabilization phase s1 exhibited slightly better performance than s2 achieving 49 42 2 78 mg o2 g mlss h vs the level of 46 88 1 85 mg o2 g mlss h in s2 fig s2 shows the variation in sludge particle size and indicates that the two reactors exhibited similar sizes of preliminary cultivated particles fig 1 shows a microscopic view of the sludge the sludge on day 50 exhibited granulation and flattening caused by dehydration filamentous bacteria proliferated in the initial phase and were densely amassed 3 2 overall performance in c n and p removal fig 2 depicts the removal performances of both anoxic oxic a o systems during the aerobic granulation process based on the data from day 70 over the entire process the average influent cod nh4 n and tp concentrations were 426 31 and 4 mg l respectively accommodation period 363 28 and 4 2 mg l respectively formation period and 322 28 and 4 4 mg l respectively stabilization period in s1 the average cod nh4 n and tp removal rates were 91 61 92 47 and 43 87 respectively accommodation period 94 38 99 12 and 62 36 respectively formation period and 94 14 99 01 and 87 85 respectively stabilization period however in s2 the average cod nh4 n and tp removal rates were 86 76 85 21 and 39 03 respectively accommodation period 93 43 98 56 and 49 28 respectively formation period and 95 26 98 56 and 97 28 respectively stabilization period the performance of s1 was superior to that of s2 during the accommodation and formation periods in s2 the pollutant removal efficiencies strongly fluctuated but when s1 and s2 entered the stabilization period after granulation s2 showed a greater improvement than s1 in pollutant removal the cod and nh4 n concentrations of the final effluent from the two reactors were lower than 30 and 1 mg l respectively while the average effluent tp values in s1 and s2 were 0 78 and 0 12 mg l respectively 3 3 dynamic performance in c n and p removal over different phases in a typical cycle fig 3 presents the cycle performances during the different phases which were analyzed to investigate the mechanisms of cod nitrogen and phosphorus removal the degradation rate and time to equilibrium of cod and nh4 n gradually improved throughout the process but the final equilibrium time point of degradation was mostly concentrated at 120 min and s1 possessed better metabolism than s2 with respect to cod and nh4 n nitrite underwent similar accumulation processes in the two reactors yet s2 exhibited higher accumulation with a concentration of 8 57 mg l regarding the variation in nitrate accumulation compared with s2 s1 showed a lower effluent concentration and higher nitrogen removal on day 70 and the nitrate content of the effluent in both reactors was less than 6 mg l table 1 presents the detailed pollution removal parameters for each of the anaerobic and aerobic phases throughout the anaerobic phase the released phosphorus gradually increased the specific po4 p release rate of s1 reached 8 54 0 11 mg p g 1 ss h 1 and was much higher than that of s2 3 17 0 09 mg p g 1 ss1 ss h 1 indicating higher efficiency of the former the ratio of p release naac uptake increased from 0 013 to 0 250 in s1 and from 0 010 to 0 262 in s2 over the formation period however after the granulation of the sludge was complete this ratio increased to 0 274 in s2 and was higher than 0 24 in s1 in the aerobic phase nitrogen variation and phosphorus uptake were the main aspects reflecting relative bioactivity s1 seemed to have advantages over s2 in terms of n removal during the accommodation period the n removal of s1 reached 7 89 0 96 mg l and was higher and more stable than that of s2 3 46 0 2 27 mg l this finding was supported by the denitrification rates of s1 and s2 which were 2 87 0 35 and 1 26 0 76 mg n l 1 h 1 respectively however the nitrification rate remained at a similar level so snd efficiency appears to be a significant parameter for estimating nitrogen removal capacity under aerobic conditions the snd efficiency of s1 increased from 54 to 84 and was greater than that of s2 which increased from 34 to 75 however phosphorus uptake reached 9 72 4 12 and 9 08 0 94 mg l in s1 and s2 respectively and s1 exhibited slightly superior but unstable performance to s2 during the stabilization phase 3 4 characterization of epss in different phases the composition and content of ps and pn in different operation periods are presented fig 4b the amount of eps in both reactors markedly increased between day 30 and day 70 from 36 37 to 57 91 mg g mlss s1 and from 22 63 to 54 34 mg g mlss s2 in particular ps greatly increased from 27 91 to 41 91 mg g mlss in s1 and from 12 54 to 43 01 mg g mlss in s2 in addition a sticky excretion which might have been ps covered the surface of the granules to form a barrier which was confirmed by sem additionally the increase in pn content was more obvious in s1 than s2 with pn increasing from 8 46 to 15 93 mg g mlss in s1 and from 2 43 to 7 21 mg l mlss in s2 overall ps was higher than pn and exhibited a rapid increase in both reactors which directly contributed to the considerable variation in ps pn to reveal the variation in eps eps was characterized by 3d eem at the end of each of the three phases the results are presented in fig 4a the compositions of the fluorescence spectra varied among the different operational periods according to 19 divided 3d eem spectra can provide information regarding four major types of eps i aromatic pn region a ex em 200 250 280 380 ii fulvic acid like region b ex em 200 250 380 440 iii tryptophan and pn like region c ex em 310 340 350 450 and iv humic acid like substances region d ex em 350 365 450 455 the results indicated that aromatic pns fulvic acid like compounds tryptophan and pn like compounds existed throughout the phases and exhibited slight variations in concentration which seemed stronger in s1 than in s2 the humic acid like substances in the reactors presented similar trends with the corresponding fluorescence intensity first increasing in the formation phase and then decreasing in the stabilization period which might signal an intermediate stage of granulation ftir spectra were obtained to examine the transformation of the groups attached to eps and evaluate the differences in a high do environment fig 4c the positions and numbers of ftir peaks for the eps samples at different phases were fully assembled indicating similar chemical ingredients in the eps however the intensity of the respective peaks was observed to strengthen the peak at approximately 3440 cm 1 was ascribed to oh stretching hydrogen bonded 20 and strengthened over time especially in s2 weak absorption at 2925 2974 cm 1 was largely maintained throughout the process and was attributed to the asymmetrical ch stretching vibration of the aliphatic ch2 group 21 which is responsible for the eem characteristics of aromatic pns and fulvic acid like compounds however the bands near 1100 1455 and 1650 cm 1 were related to synthesis of the ch2 group of aliphatic chains nh groups in the presence of pns and co stretching vibrations from carbohydrates and aromatics respectively 22 all of the bands exhibited obvious reinforcement on day 70 especially in region c furthermore compared with s1 s2 exhibited more obvious changes in all functional groups however guibaud et al 23 identified bands at 600 900 cm 1 reflecting the existence of unsaturated bonds which were susceptible to oxidation and response to the rare peak occurrence 3 5 microbial community 3 5 1 bacterial richness and diversity the taxon richness and diversity of the microbial community in different operational phases and under high do concentrations were estimated table s3 fig 5a indicated that the data achieved sufficient sequencing depth fig 5b suggests that microbes occurred in distinct screenings and that different functional bacteria were enriched a venn diagram fig 5c of the full operation based on otus indicated that the majority of microbes were common to both reactors after day 50 and that the systemic microbial structure presented a low transformation rate the sequence tags of the reactors were 34 245 s1 and 51 353 s2 on day 70 and distributed among 403 and 446 otus defined by a 3 distance threshold the ace chao shannon and simpson indices were used to represent bacterial richness and diversity the ace and chao results indicated a reduction in community richness interestingly the indices tended to maintain stable levels suggesting that the bacterial community structure tended to remain approximately uniform across the different processes 3 5 2 bacterial community structure the evolution of bacterial community structure was investigated to explore microbial dynamics samples from s1 and s2 were acquired on days 0 30 50 and 70 during the cultivation process and examined at the phylum class and genus levels a total of 12 phyla were identified fig s3 common wastewater treatment microorganisms include proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria chloroflexi and firmicutes 24 the two most dominant phyla after granulation were proteobacteria and bacteroidetes which accounted for 43 25 and 41 85 respectively s1 and 68 87 and 17 75 respectively s2 of the total phyla however proteobacteria was enriched over the process accounting for 67 43 s1 of phyla on day 70 whereas bacteroidetes declined to 20 08 s1 the dominant microbes in s2 showed subtle changes in abundance with the relative percentage of bacteroidetes increasing to 28 01 nevertheless there were no obvious differences in the sequencing results from day 70 between the different processes class level analysis was performed to deeply investigate the full course from inoculation to granulation fig s4 alphaproteobacteria accumulated over the entire operation increasing from 11 88 to 53 02 s1 and from 18 29 to 50 50 s2 gammaproteobacteria presented different proportions between the two processes accounting for 41 39 s1 and 5 71 s2 of the community at inoculation and ultimately reaching 11 98 s1 and 12 39 s2 gammaproteobacteria abundance appreciably decreased in s1 and increased in s2 moreover cytophagia was enriched during the process representing 15 61 and 23 10 of the community in s1 and s2 respectively at the end of the operation planctomycetia and sphingobacteria presented slight variations over the cultivation process and accounted for low proportions of the total community with relative percentages of 2 59 s1 and 1 74 s2 for planctomycetia and 0 28 s1 and 0 58 s2 for sphingobacteria sequencing analysis was also performed at the genus level to illustrate the evolution of the microbial community at a more detailed level fig 5d a heat map was constructed showing the changes in abundance of the top 45 genera paracoccus unclassified cytophagales unclassified gammaproteobacteria and unclassified bacteroidetes were common and the dominant bacteria on day 70 with percentages of 29 74 10 86 6 08 and 3 12 respectively s1 and 26 61 18 54 10 66 and 4 10 s2 respectively unclassified cytophagales belonging to class cytophagia were enriched in the intermediate stages of both processes and declined thereafter however thiothrix roseibacillus and unclassified rhodocyclaceae seemed to be interim microbes in both processes thiothrix was enriched during the accommodation phase with percentages ranging from 4 48 to 42 46 s1 and from 0 51 to 4 09 s2 from days 0 to 50 as the granules gradually formed the abundance of thiothrix decreased to 4 07 s1 and 0 52 s2 roseibacillus and unclassified rhodocyclaceae had percentages of 1 02 and 2 43 respectively in s1 and 2 29 and 3 52 respectively in s2 at the end of the full operation their highest percentages were 4 49 and 6 97 respectively s1 and 7 03 and 15 61 respectively s2 3 5 3 functional microbes the functional genera are summarized in table 2 and included denitrifying phosphate accumulating organisms dnpaos denitrifying bacteria dnb glycogen accumulating organisms gaos nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob and eps producers these genera were studied to further reveal the transformation of the physiological mechanism throughout the operation the different types of inoculation caused obvious differences in the initial abundance of dnb the abundance of dnb in s1 48 51 was higher than that in s2 7 96 although similar abundances were reached after granulation s1 31 02 s2 28 52 the abundance of nob decreased in both reactors and the percentages of dnpaos and gaos increased eps producers had a relative abundance of 29 52 in s2 which was much higher than that in s1 15 49 3 5 4 metabolic pathway analysis with kegg and cog functional differences in metabolic pathways were mapped based on kegg fig s5 and cog fig s6 secondary classification and prediction from gene sequences to elaborate how granule formation affected microbial survival strategies the kegg results were divided into four functional categories namely information storage and processing f h s metabolism b c d g i j p r cellular processes and signaling a e k l m q and poorly characterized n o the functional prediction of metabolism and cellular processes and signaling highlighted advantages suggesting great metabolic activities within the bacteria the cog results readily matched the nutrient metabolic performance twelve main functions including methanol oxidation methylotrophy nitrate denitrification nitrite denitrification nitrous oxide denitrification dark hydrogen oxidation nitrite respiration aerobic chemoheterotrophy nitrate respiration nitrate reduction and photoheterotrophy were considerably improved over the entire operation methanol oxidation and methylotrophy reinforcement were responsible for the influent with sodium acetate alone the prediction of nitrate denitrification nitrite denitrification and nitrous oxide denitrification suggested an improvement in nitric compound removal after granulation which was consistent with the dynamic degradation process however some functions such as aerobic ammonia oxidation aerobic nitrite oxidation and nitrification were reduced in some cases nearly disappearing and then gradually increased after granulation in both reactors although they remained lower than they were in the original samples one engaging phenomenon was that the variations in dark oxidation of sulfur compounds and dark sulfide oxidation detected based on the number of matched genes strongly coincided with the transformation in abundance of thiothrix 4 discussion 4 1 sludge and nutrient transformation over granulation based on the experimental results it can be concluded that the low biomass was due to the short fixed settling time which divided the operation into three phases this settling pattern resulted in rapid loss in biomass in both reactors however such settling can help achieve better setting properties 25 27 svi5min was higher than that reported in other studies 24 11 whereas sv5min gradually decreased over the operation suggesting that excellent settling was achieved the biomass growth in s2 was higher than that in s1 this difference might have been caused by the different inoculations the filamentous bacteria contributed to sludge granulation and their performance was consistent with microbial sequencing results regarding nutrient removal during the operation in the accommodation phase biomass was seriously lost and the activities of various microorganisms were affected by the new environment thus the removal of pollutants decreased with fluctuation in the formation phase the removal of all pollutants steadily and gradually increased verawaty et al 7 noted that after the production of granular sludge the removal rate of nutrients increased and the granulated sludge contributed to the nutrient removal in the stabilization phase removal steadily increased and the removal of all nutrients especially nitrogen and phosphorus appeared to be overtly enhanced over the entire operation the inoculated granular sludge in s1 showed better adaptability than the sludge in s2 the variations in compound concentrations over the different phases of degradation revealed favorable self regulation in both systems the efficiencies of cod and nh4 n removal were enhanced as evidenced by the enhancement of the degradation rate from the formation phase to the stabilization phase especially when nh4 n increased from 0 18 to 0 22 mg min in both reactors the results confirmed that the granular material contributed to nutrient removal 28 the degradation of nitrite and nitrate was probably caused by the inoculation with the partly aerobic granular material which likely provided conditions favorable for bacterial resistance against high do 29 in addition the snd rate illustrated the superiority of inoculation with partially granular sludge the improvement in the ratio of p release naac uptake indicated that phosphorus accumulation was substantially enhanced over the morphological transformation from floc to granular sludge semerci and hasilci 18 found that the fastest rate of p release hac uptake was 0 14 in anaerobic aerobic anoxic modes which is far below our result under high do after granulation the strength of phosphorus release was gradually enhanced in response to accumulating accumulibacter and the rate of p release naac uptake exhibited slight variation which also revealed increased glycogen accumulation li et al 9 suggested that granular sludge with rapid settling features was not readily washed out from the reactor and comprised more complex biotic communities than traditional active sludge which might be attributed to s1 s apparent advantage over s2 in phosphorus release in the initial phase considering the results together it can be concluded that the utilization of partially granular sludge as seed sludge is feasible for the initial operation 4 2 eps variation during granulation eps can improve hydrophobicity and polymeric interactions as well as create bridges between the cells and cages to entrap cells the secretion of eps slightly increased under the high do concentrations in contrast to a previous finding 19 which reinforced the granulation process in granular sludge the secretion of pss as gel forming polymers responsible for the stability of granules was found to increase to maintain the stability of the microbial consortium under high do this capacity is similar to that of pn which has been demonstrated able to react with positively charged ions such as cu ii and fe ii iii 30 31 to protect microorganisms against harsh environments however the large difference in polymers between the reactors might stem from the difference in seed sludge with granular sludge having preferable self protected structural integrity than normal active sludge nevertheless the 3d eem results implied that humic acid like substances may promote aerobic granular formation via functions such as facilitating the proliferation of certain bacteria or the disintegration of organic macromolecules 32 wang et al 11 found that humic acid like substances varied greatly under different cod n ratios and high do concentrations such variation also appeared in this study in chemical groups of eps variation in oh might be a response to increases in components such as humic acid like compounds due to high ambient do since hydroxyl and amino groups can resist a strong oxidizing environment and prevent cell damage which can explain the increase in ps pn furthermore the sludge granulation caused extreme enrichment of the ch ch2 and co groups and inoculation with active sludge could result in the secretion of more chemical compounds however no peaks occurred inside the bands before morphological change under the high do environment they arose only after granulation 4 3 the evolution of microorganisms and the functional prediction results the results in table s2 indicate that s1 presented lower bacterial richness and diversity than s2 the higher simpson index value in s1 was a response to the presence of granular material in the seed sludge cultivated by a sole carbon source as a result of the strong selection pressure from the sedimentary mode and carbon source a majority of the parallel microbial species were conserved leading to an increasingly concentrated microbial distribution regarding the studied phyla proteobacteria can remove some pollutants such as aromatic compounds 33 bacteroidetes is widely regarded as one of the most abundant heterotrophic microbial taxa with the capacity to secrete extracellular polymers and effectively degrade organic matter 34 the large enrichment revealed that proteobacteria was more competitive than bacteroidetes under high do concentrations consistent with the results of 29 regarding the studied classes alphaproteobacteria possesses a strong ability of biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal 35 luo et al 36 suggested that alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria dominated at the beginning of the ags cultivation process to retain effluent quality and were subsequently outnumbered by betaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria is currently the most abundant microbe at the class level 37 however in this study alphaproteobacteria became the dominant taxon this result might have been due to the special environment available to alphaproteobacteria a genus with the ability to secrete abundant extracellular polymers especially at high do concentrations planctomycetia and sphingobacteria can assist ps disintegration heterotrophic metabolism and biological nitrogen removal processes 38 10 and these taxa improved pollutant degradation with respect to the studied genera paracoccus has been identified as a denitrifying phosphorus accumulating bacterium that plays a significant role in low c n wastewater 39 41 and its enrichment over the operation could explain the systematic simultaneous phosphorus nitrogen removal unclassified cytophagales has been identified as group of fermentative bacteria with the capacity to hydrolyze organic compounds to organic acids and co2 under anaerobic conditions 42 43 the variation in the abundance of this genus was similar to that in humic acid like substances which might explain the variation in microbial excretion through microbiology cytophagia also appeared in 11 28 in a high do environment accounting for a considerable percentage of the microbes present unclassified gammaproteobacteria and unclassified bacteroidetes were ascribed to the classes gammaproteobacteria and bacteroidetes and considered to have a uniform function thiothrix is an obligate aerobic mixotroph that frequently appears in enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr systems with good performance 42 and it has been identified as a denitrifying bacterium that enhances nitrogen removal 43 14 thiothrix favored granular formation and structural stabilization and enhanced nutrient removal efficiency in s1 roseibacillus and unclassified rhodocyclaceae are considered denitrifying organisms 44 and exhibited similar abundance changes as thiothrix from the analyses at the phylum class and genus levels it can be concluded that the addition of granular sludge can enhance granulation and pollutant degradation especially in the accommodation period when the sludge was granular in shape it was difficult for the microbial community structure to evolve regarding the functional microbes the abundance of dnbs directly contributed to the initial distinction in nitrogen removal capacity their changing abundance suggested that the external selection pressure was key in determining the final microbial composition the decrease in nobs might have led to weaker nitrate reduction efficiency and therefore nitrite accumulation in the preliminary phase the increase in dnpaos and the existence of gaos followed the enhancement of tp removal and substantial organic metabolism in the anaerobic period as depicted by 18 11 the enrichment of eps producers suggests microbial adaptation to different states such as a high do environment 45 the high richness of eps producers in s2 might be attributable to the susceptibility of the active sludge to the environment functional prediction analysis can provide great insight into the behavior of microorganisms in wastewater treatment processes and is significant for exploring the behavior of microorganisms based on the pns associated with cellular processes and signaling the capacity for nitrogen compound degradation implied that the bacteria were susceptible to environmental variation this phenomenon could explain the low abundance of nobs whereas great nitrite oxidation was achieved suggesting that microbial metabolomics could be applied to determine nitrogen transformation over the granulation process a similar finding was reported by 24 and the present results support his conclusion that the organisms had high bioactivity the kegg and cog analyses indicated that some mechanistic pathways were reinforced which revealed the crucial cellular behaviors expressed to adapt to the new environment methanol oxidation methylotrophy and nitrogen compound metabolism were all intensified in response to the environmental variation however the particular behavior of sulfide metabolism and the proliferation of thiothrix difficultly deduced from the analyses of influent composition and nutrient degradation were coincident in the functional prediction 5 conclusion this research demonstrated that inoculation with ags provided advantages over the use of active sludge for pollutant removal under preliminary operation and that humic pn like substances and oh stretching hydrogen bonded play transitional roles during granulation microbial analysis revealed that paracoccus and unclassified cytophagales were enriched and cellular processes and signaling were strengthened from flocs to granules declaration of competing interest the

13484,the preparation of novel iron oxide flax seeds based hybrid nanocomposite referred to as magnetic flax seeds and its application for water treatment has been reported herein a simple co precipitation method was followed and the detailed mechanism of the preparation has been discussed the prepared magnetic flax seeds powder was characterized by employing several spectroscopic and microscopic techniques the characterization results showed that the magnetic nanocomposite possessed massive functional groups of flax seeds and hydroxyl groups of iron oxide the nanocomposite has a porous structure with particles size distributions in the range 1 14 32 nm the magnetic composite was investigated for adsorption utility in water treatment technology by picking malachite green dye under the effect of various process parameters such as ph contact time temperature concentration and amount of adsorbent the equilibrium adsorption capacity of the magnetic nanocomposite dosage 1 0 g l 1 for malachite green concentration 10 mg l 1 was found to be approximately 10 mg g 1 at 30 c 7 ph and 60 min contact time with maximum adsorption capacity qmax 52 910 mg g 1 the sorption process was proved feasible and endothermic at all the tested temperatures 30 50 c and concentrations 10 60 mg l 1 the adsorption data followed freundlich isotherm kf value 20 893 mg g 1 which suggested the multilayer physisorption process the kinetic investigation suggested a pseudo second order sorption process k2 0 050 g mg 1 min 1 and governed through particle diffusion the ease in preparation low cost magnetic characteristic and high adsorption capacity will make the water treatment technique more efficient with the magnetic flax seeds keywords water pollution malachite green adsorption composite magnetic flax seed 1 introduction the contamination of water with addition of dyes is most concerning subject for environmental agencies because large numbers of diseases are associated with the consumption of toxic dyes through water 1 moreover these dyes are highly visible and impart intense colour to the water on dissolution and hence can hamper the sunlight entry into water thus affect the aquatic life adversely 2 the toxic dyes even at low concentration adversely affect aquatic environment and can easily aggregate in the human body through food chain causing a variety of diseases and disorders 3 many dyes are found to be carcinogenic affect liver urinary bladder and intestines 4 among various dyes malachite green mg is most noxious carcinogenic and highly poisonous to the living cells 5 mg has a complex and rigid structure and acts as a tumor enhancing agent for the liver 6 therefore its removal from industrial effluents is mandatory before discharging into water sources however its removal from water is not easy therefore an effective method has to be developed for the same adsorption is one such method that is effective for dyes removal and involves low cost environmentally safe material synthesized with minimal waste disposal 7 also one can enhance the adsorption property of the materials by its modification through many ways to meet the desired need 8 several low cost adsorbents have been prepared and utilized for the removal of toxic colorants 9 nanoscience is a highly emerging area of science that involves the application of materials having size in the range 1 100 nm the term nano brought special shape size and alternative composition with unique physicochemical and biological properties in comparison to materials from which it is prepared 10 nanoparticles can be synthesized via various methods like co precipitation chemical reduction thermal reduction sol gel hydrothermal microemulsion ion scattering and sputtering laser ablation and sonochemical method 11 16 furthermore nanotechnology is a multidisciplinary technology and serves as a bridge between various disciplines of chemistry physics biology material science and medical science it changes the overall properties and improve structural thermal mechanical catalytic electrochemical chemical and physical properties in comparison to the bulk material it profoundly shows the application in degradation of organic pollutants antibiotics electrochemical hydrogen storage solid phase extraction drug delivery food processing agriculture production animal feed and in the biomedical sector 10 17 20 magnetically activated carbons have been reported as potential adsorbents for almost all kinds of colour imparting water pollutants 21 they can be effective for several adsorption desorption cycles with high regeneration power however activated carbon preparation needs high energy consumption and chemical activation which enhances the overall cost of the adsorption process 21 22 the recent target of research is to achieve low cost eco friendly and effective alternatives of magnetic activated carbons natural plant based magnetic materials such as seeds 22 leaves 23 etc have been proved more effective than magnetic activated carbon and fulfill the demand in every aspect 24 25 the insoluble cell walls of the plant s materials are made up of cellulose and hemicelluloses lignin tannins and structural proteins and or other phytochemicals that provide plenty of functional oxygen nitrogen containing groups which act as binding sites for metal ions mn during the preparation of composite materials 22 the preparation of several plant based such as seeds leaves sprouts gum mucilage and cellulose derived from plants composite materials have been reported 22 in all these composites the plant materials act as carbon frameworks on which nanoparticles have been grown for instance podder and majumder 26 used neem leaves as a common framework for several studies viz neem leaves mnfe2o4 composite biosorbent bacteria immobilization on neem leaves mnfe2o4 composite surface 27 bacillus arsenicus biofilms supported on a neem leaves mnfe2o4 composite 28 and corynebacterium glutamicum mtcc2745 biofilm supported on neem leaves mnfe2o4 composite 29 yuvaraja et al 2020a b 24 25 have reported the preparation of magnetic arachis hypogaea leaves and magnetic momordica charantia leaves respectively the black cumin seeds based mno2 30 mnfe2o4 31 fe2o3 zro2 32 and fe2o3 sno2 33 composites have been reported for dye removal abdulla et al 2019 and 2021 23 34 have reported the preparation of guava leaves based γ fe2o3 and ag ag2o zro2 gl composites for the water cleansing respectively similarly sawdust of syzygium cumini jamun tree in hindi has been utilized as a common framework for preparation of several composites viz sawdust mnfe2o4 composite 35 bacterial cells immobilized on sawdust mnfe2o4 composite 36 bacterial biofilm supported on sawdust mnfe2o4 composite 37 bacillus arsenicus mtcc 4380 biofilm supported on sawdust mnfe2o4 composite 38 and corynebacterium glutamicum mtcc 2745 immobilized on sawdust mnfe2o4 composite 39 all these composites had been utilized for the removal of pollutants from water hence the present study involving the preparation and application of magnetic flax seeds mfs is an extension of the previous researche carried out flax seeds fs have omega 3 fatty acids and are known as a super food that contains antioxidant substances like lignin and promotes hormonal balance improves digestion cardiovascular health and controls cholesterol moreover fs is a great source of dietary fiber minerals like manganese thiamine and magnesium and plant based protein 40 the utility of fs as a biosorbent has also been reported by other workers 41 42 and their use can make the water treatment process safe hygienic and effective in terms of cost adsorption efficiency and bulk generation of material therefore this work focuses the synthesis of mfs for the adsorptive removal of mg dye from water the batch adsorption experiments were performed to optimize reaction parameters to determine isotherm kinetic and thermodynamic parameters which are required to propose mechanism of the sorption process there is no study available in the literature on the preparation of magnetic flax seeds hence this is the first reported novel work 2 experimental the experimental procedure adopted for the preparation characterization and application of magnetic flax seeds for adsorption are given below in details 2 1 materials and chemicals reagents the materials and chemicals required for this study are discussed in the supplementary information file esi 2 2 synthesis of magnetic flax seeds the cleaned flax seeds fs powder was prepared following procedure as discussed in the literature 43 and then used to prepare its composite scheme 1 for preparation of mfs 1 0 g of fs powder was firstly dispersed in 100 ml of double distilled water ddw then 100 ml each of 0 5 m fe no3 3 9h2o and 0 25 m feso4 7h2o solutions were added slowly to the above beaker under continuous stirring at 500 rpm 44 45 after 30 min of further continued stirring the temperature of the aqueous mixture was raised to 50 5 c then drop wise alkali solution 4 0 m naoh was added to maintain the alkaline ph 10 to 10 5 at alkaline ph a black precipitate was obtained in the form of magnetic material fig 1 24 25 the precipitate was then magnetically separated washed with ddw several times and dried at 90 5 c for 24 h and referred as magnetic flax seed mfs the synthesized composite was characterized for physiochemical properties and then used for the adsorption application the magnetic character of the prepared sample can be seen from fig 2 2 3 instrumentation and characterization the physiochemical properties of the prepared magnetic sample were analyzed with the help of various characterization tools and techniques as discussed in the supplementary information file esi 2 4 mg adsorption experiments the adsorption performance of mfs was investigated in batch mode for laboratory prepared aqueous solution of malachite green mg dye the stock solution of mg was prepared by dissolving certain quantity in ddw and diluted as per requirement adsorption experiments were performed as discussed in the supplementary information file esi briefly 10 0 ml of mg dye solutions were taken in a series of 50 ml erlenmeyer flasks and after adding mfs subjected to adsorption experiments under the effect of variable parameters and then optimum conditions as discussed in the concerned result section the flasks were agitated mechanically on water bath shaker at 180 rpm the agitated aqueous solutions from each experimental set were centrifugated to remove mfs particles solid each solution was then subjected to the spectrophotometric analysis as discussed in the supplementary information file esi to determine the remained concentration of dye in the solution after sorption the adsorption performance of mfs for mg was determined by substituting data into the mathematical equations eqs s2 and s3 given in the supplementary information file esi 3 result and discussion the results of physiochemical analysis and adsorption experiments are given below 3 1 mechanism of preparation of mfs this study was conducted for achieving low cost material required for water treatment with easy preparation and good biocompatibility for this purpose a previously reported method was adopted with some modifications 27 it is well known that constituents in the plants extract react with the metal ions and ultimately form metal oxide nanoparticles in a single step process 46 the formation of nanoparticles in the presence of plant extract makes preparation of organic inorganic hybrid nanocomposites an easy and one step process recently various modifications have been made in the methods involved for the biological synthesis of nanoparticles and the bio precipitation step can be accelerated by adding naoh for instance prasad et al 2016 47 have produced iron iii oxide nanocrystals with leaf extract of garlic vine and used 1 0 m naoh solution to accelerate the bio precipitation of iron oxide similarly rao et al 2013 48 have reported the preparation of iron oxide nanoparticles using iron salts fe3 fe2 and the leaf extract of pomegranate and for accelerating the yield of iron oxide they have added 1 0 n naoh makarov et al 2014 49 have also reported the synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles using aqueous extract of hordeum vulgare and rumex acetosa and they also revealed the role of ph in the stability of iron nanoparticles therefore the present study also reports the preparation of iron oxide in the presence of naoh which led to high precipitation of iron salts it has also been reported that co precipitation using naoh gives small particles 50 51 the preparation of fe3o4 under the same conditions as followed in the present study has also been reported by the yew et al 2016 67 who have used both kappaphycus alvarezii extract as well as naoh for the synthesis of kappaphycus alvarezii fe3o4 nps firstly a solution of fe3 and fe2 with a 2 1 m ratio was added into the seaweed extract to obtain a yellowish colloidal solution then the freshly prepared 1 0 m of naoh solution was added drop wise under continuous stirring to adjust ph 11 the solution was then stirred for 1 h to homogenize the solution and also for the completion of the reaction after that the as synthesized fe3o4 nps were separated by using a permanent magnet the fe3o4 nps were washed several times with deionized water the nanoparticles were dried in an oven at around 70 c for 24 h the scheme of preparation of fe3o4 has been explained as given below extract fe 2 aq fe 3 aq extract fe 3 fe 2 extract fe 3 fe 2 oh aq extract fe 3 o 4 s therefore for enhancing the yield of the product and to get small size nanoparticles to be incorporated in the carbon framework the naoh solution was added during the present synthesis naoh might had helped during the co precipitation of iron salts present on the surface of flax seeds the seed powder was not decanted from the reaction mixture during the preparation to achieve the low cost material with an easy one step preparation the reaction mechanism of the preparation of material can be justified as follows initially the presence of plenty of functional groups on the surface of flax seeds fs oh fs cooh might have provided the attractive sites to the metal ions fe2 and fe3 and adsorbed on its surface thereafter co precipitation reaction might have occurred and initialized with the formation of hydroxides of the metal ions the high concentration of naoh used during the reaction might have contributed large number of oh ions in the solution which might have been attracted by the metals ions fe2 and fe3 adsorbed on the fs powder substrate and formed the metal hydroxides m oh x afterwards the nucleation of m oh x might have proceeded on fs surface and ultimately formed their respective oxides scheme 1 the high concentration of oh ions might have been responsible for the fast nucleation and resulting into the generation of tiny nuclei thus low crystallite size production occurred 51 during the process the extract of the plant leaves might have also worked as capping agent by reacting with the iron ions giving small sized nanoparticles as the major feature of the plant extract is to prevent the agglomeration of nanoparticles 46 the biosynthesis of nanoparticles with plant extract and use of naoh has also been reported for the zinc oxide nanoparticles where 15 ml of leaf extract of calotropis and 2 m naoh was used 52 several studies can also be seen similar to the present study such as neem leaves mnfe2o4 27 magnetic arachis hypogaea leaves 24 and magnetic momordica charantia leaves 25 where leaves were not filtered and hence remained in the extract and then in situ incorporation of nanoparticles in the leaves were reported the similar method has been used for the preparation of magnetic soya bean sprouts fe3o4 sbs in almost the same temperature and ph conditions 44 therefore the literature validates the present preparation of magnetic nanocomposite 3 2 characterization the prepared composite was characterized by employing several spectroscopic and microscopic techniques as discussed below 3 2 1 ft ir analysis it is very common that organic frameworks have large numbers of functional groups such as hydroxyl carbonyl amide and carboxylic acid due to the presence of various phytochemical constituents these functional groups provide attractive sites for metal ions to interact with the surface of the carbon framework thus the formation of composite occurs due to the presence of large numbers of functional sites in principle the ft ir spectrum gives information about the functional groups present in the material based on the constituents for the present study the ft ir spectrum of mfs was compared with the ft ir spectrum obtained for fs seed powder fig 3 and table 1 the ft ir spectrum of fs powder fig 3a revealed the presence of numerous functional groups such as oh c o and nh etc in the carbon framework of seeds 53 these functional groups are majorly due to the cellulosic and protein constituents of the structure of seeds 24 25 the shifting in the ft ir bands accounted for the fs powder along with the appearance of new bands can be seen in the magnetic sample of fs powder table 1 new bands appeared at 616 to 466 cm 1 which was accounted for the stretching vibration of m o bonds some peaks also disappeared in the ft ir spectrum of mfs fig 3b hence the ft ir spectrum of mfs exhibited the frequencies accounted for fs with some shifting and disappearance and magnetic metal oxide feo particles fe2o3 or fe3o4 suggesting the strong interactions electrostatic and or non electrostatic between the magnetic nanoparticles and fs powder 54 therefore the ft ir spectrum studies of mfs suggested the growth of magnetic particles in the carbon framework of fs powder the ft ir spectrum of mg loaded mfs also have been shown in fig 3c the shifting in the ft ir bands assigned for mfs after the mg adsorption suggest the interaction between surface of mfs and mg and through electrostatic and or non electrostatic forces such as h bonding table 1 3 2 2 xrd analysis in general the peaks position in xrd pattern simply represent the fingerprint of the material regardless of the size the peak position in xrd pattern depends on the lattice parameters which are presented as angle and determined using bragg s law this issue is different in the different materials but similar for the similar materials the xrd spectrum of a powder should also be the same either that is in the bulk or nanomaterials as the chemical composition and bonding are the same regardless of the size of the particle grown some difference in the peak position can be seen only due to the internal stresses in materials this is very common physio chemistry of xrd analysis for this study the powder x ray diffraction pattern of fs powder was accounted for the carbon structure of seeds fig 4a the obtained xrd pattern for fs powder was almost similar to the xrd pattern of other organic contents reported by several research groups 55 57 all the reported diffraction peaks have been indexed to the structure of cellulose in natural plant materials the observed peaks could be assigned to the reflections from the 002 planes in the order of ascending 2θ values although the change in the intensities in xrd is attributed to the conditions of materials heat treatment light exposure and so on the p xrd pattern of mfs fig 4b revealed the characteristics peaks of iron oxide magnetite and or maghemite particles iop in the magnetic composite sample the similar pattern of p xrd has also been reported by other researchers 23 58 59 however the actual phase of iop was confirmed from the characteristic peaks of io found at the 311 plane for this xrd pattern the 2θ value corresponding to 311 plane appeared at 35 56 which is closure to the standard 2θ value of the magnetite fe3o4 at 35 423 the standard 2θ values of magnetite or maghemite is the basic features of these structures evaluated by xrd pattern 60 therefore the present xrd study showed the presence of fe3o4 in the mfs sample jcpds 39 1346 the average crystallite size of mfs was evaluated at approximately 17 015 nm using debye scherer equation eq s1 esi 3 2 3 sem edx and tem analysis sem is used for imaging the surface of the nanomaterial in a submicroscopic scale which gives the information of topography of the materials shape or structures for this study the sem images fig 5a showed and confirmed growth of iop onto the entire surface of seeds however the shape of iop were found to be irregular quasi spherical with various sizes the agglomeration of the particles can also be seen which might be attributed to the irregularities in the shape and size of the composite particles the sem images confirmed the porous structure of mfs composite the energy dispersive x ray edx analysis is a standard method for identifying and quantifying the elemental composition in a sample of material the elemental composition of mfs fig 5b was analyzed and found that the composite had 53 59 wt of fe 37 55 wt of o 7 85 wt of c and 1 01 wt of n the presence of oxygen o nitrogen n and carbon c in the sample might be due to the seeds and fe comes from the metal oxide grown in the seeds framework the tem is the best technique for analyzing the internal structure and size of the materials in nanometer scale the tem image for mfs fig 6a showed the growth of nps on the carbon framework of fs with quasi spherical shape agglomeration of particles can also be seen in tem image and these results suggested the well growth of metal oxide nps in the carbon framework of fs the tem histogram revealed the mean sizes of mfs nps as 7 9 nm with standard deviation of 2 5 nm and the size distribution of mfs nps ranges from 1 to 14 3 nm fig 6b 61 3 3 effect of experimental parameters on mg adsorption the four variables adsorbent dosage contact time ph and initial concentration of dye of the experiment were studied using one variable at a time ovat optimization method and the results have been concluded on the basis of adsorption capacity i e amount of mg adsorbed in milligram onto per gram of mfs an increase in the dosage of mfs 0 5 to 2 0 g l 1 in the mg solution of 10 mg l 1 concentration decreased the adsorption capacity of mfs by 5 0 mg g from 18 22 mg g 1 after 60 min contact time at 30 1 c and ph 7 0 fig 7 from the eq s2 it can be seen that the adsorption capacity of an adsorbent is inversely proportional to its amount therefore present trend was obtained on composite dosage variation for fixed concentration of mg in solution for further study 1 0 g l 1 dosage of mfs was used the effect of initial mg concentrations on the adsorption capacity of 1 0 g l 1 dosage of mfs was also analyzed for 60 min contact time the initial concentration of mg was varied from 10 to 60 mg l 1 and the corresponding results suggested the higher adsorption capacity of mfs at the higher mg concentrations fig 7 from the eq s2 it can be further seen that the adsorption capacity of an adsorbent is directly proportional to adsorbate concentration in the solution therefore the present trend was obtained for mg concentration variation in the aqueous solution for fixed amount of mfs it has been reported that the higher driving force of adsorbates at higher concentration is responsible for higher adsorption capacity of an adsorbent 60 it can also be clearly stated that the adsorption capacity of mfs for mg was higher at higher temperatures fig 8 and this trend was found for each concentration levels the higher adsorption capacity of mfs at higher temperatures suggested the endothermic nature of the sorption of mg onto the mfs surface it is well understood that the dye sorption is a temperature dependent process temperature alters the diffusion rate and at higher temperature the dye diffusion rate is higher which leads to the fast diffusion across the boundary external layer of the surface thus higher adsorption the similar result was obtained for the present mg sorption the higher probability of collision of mg to mfs surface and lower thickness of boundary layer of mfs at higher temperature might also be responsible for higher mg sorption at higher temperature 3 4 thermodynamics of mg adsorption to summarize the influence of temperature 30 50 c on mg sorption at different concentration levels 10 60 mg l 1 and corresponding mechanism the thermodynamic parameters such as gibbs free energy change δg enthalpy change δh and entropy change δs have been calculated using eqs s4 s7 esi table 2 at all the concentration levels the δh values was found to be positive which indicated the endothermic nature of the mg adsorption onto mfs the endothermicity of the sorption process might be due to the displacement of water molecules by mg during their sorption which suggested that the heat might have evolved during the sorption process the positive δs values were obtained which suggested the increase in the randomness at the interface of mfs solid surface and mg ion in the solution the higher values of δs suggested the higher extent of randomness at low concentration range moreover the δg values inferred that the reaction was feasible at every tested temperature range fig 9 the higher negative values of δg at higher temperature further suggested the favorability of adsorption process at higher temperature however at fixed temperature the δg value decreased on increasing concentration which indicated the higher extent of favorability of absorption process at lower concentration this result might be due to ease of availability of sorption sites at lower concentration for mg ions the above thermodynamic results can be justified from the published literature 62 63 3 5 isotherm studies of mg adsorption the equilibrium isotherm langmuir eq s8 and freundlich eq s9 parameters were estimated at three temperature levels of 30 40 and 50 c at ph 7 and given in table 3 the simulation plots were drawn for examining the best fitting isotherms model which indicated the well agreement of experimental adsorption capacity to freundlich adsorption capacity associated with the lower value of are error function as compared to langmuir adsorption capacity fig 10 this suggests the well establishment of freundlich isotherm model for mg adsorption onto mfs referred the physical adsorption of mg onto the heterogeneous surface of mfs accordingly the increasing order of k f values obtained from the freundlich model inferred the higher affinity between mfs and mg at higher temperature the obtained n values 2 8 4 0 further revealed the favorability of mg adsorption onto mfs surface the computed langmuir constant b and rl values eq s10 0 rl 1 supported the noticeable adsorption affinity and favorability of mg sorption onto mfs at all the tested temperatures 64 3 6 effect of contact time and adsorption kinetics as the contact time was increased from 15 to 120 min at interval of 15 min the adsorption capacity of mg onto mfs increased up to 60 min after that the plot became asymptotic with time axis fig 11 it happened because at the initial stage numerous active sites were available for mg ions to adsorb onto the mfs surface as the contact time was increased the availability of active sites on the surface of mfs decreased and the equilibrium reached at 60 min i e no more solute could be adsorbed onto the surface of the mfs the kinetics parameter can be evaluated using various kinetics models pfo eq s11 pso eq s12 elovich eq s13 weber morris eq s14 and boyd eq s15 the kinetics of mg 10 mg l 1 adsorption onto mfs 1 0 g l 1 was evaluated experimentally at 15 min time intervals of contact time ranging from 15 to 120 min at 30 c and ph 7 the acceptance of the selected kinetic models was evaluated from the values of r2 and other parameters table 4 as shown in table 4 the r2 value for pseudo second order plot was almost unity fig 12a which revealed the best fit of the experimental data for the adsorption of mg dye onto mfs with a good agreement between the maximum experimental and estimated adsorption capacity 64 thus the mg dye was expected to be bonded to mfs through weak electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding the interaction between the mg and adsorbent can be justified from the ftir spectrum of mg loaded mfs fig 3c as from elovich model fig 12b the much higher value of α 3 83 105 mg g 1 min 1 than the value of β 1 82 mg g 1 suggested that the rate of adsorption was much higher than the rate of desorption at equilibrium for mg adsorption onto the mfs 32 here in this study three straight lines can be seen in the weber morris wm plots fig 12c which accounted for the multistep three stage adsorption process table 5 the first step green line was achieved at the contact time range of 0 15 min which was accompanied with the fast adsorption process around 90 mg adsorption in 15 min due to the external mass transfer involving migration of mg from solution phase to the solid boundary of the adsorbent the second 30 to 60 min and third 75 to 120 min lines in the weber morris plot with c intercept values approximately 9 130 and 9 560 respectively which accounted to the slow stages of film diffusion and particle diffusion respectively the higher c value for third blue line suggested the slowest step of mg adsorption since the c value indicated the thickness of the boundary layer hence the higher value of c suggested the thick boundary layer therefore mg took more time to cross the boundary layer to reach to the adsorbent surface thus the particle diffusion step was a rate determining slow step for mg adsorption the boyd plot fig 12d also proved the particle diffusion as a slow step for mg adsorption onto the mfs surface 65 3 7 effect of solution ph the performance of mfs 1 0 g l 1 for mg 10 mg l 1 removal experimentally was also analyzed under the various ph environments acidic to alkaline and results are as shown in fig 13 the adsorption efficiency of mfs varied with change in ph of the mg solution the maximum performance of mfs was observed at alkaline ph in range 8 10 fig 13 the performance of mfs as a function of ph of mg solution can be justified by considering the pka value of mg dye and the charge on the surface of mfs the malachite green dye is available usually as chloride salt c6h5c c6h4n ch3 2 2 cl and in solution is dominantly positively charged which has pka value of 10 3 at lower ph the oxygenous functional groups on the mfs surface became protonated as proposed oh2 and cooh2 hence at lower ph the positive charge density enormously increased on mfs and also on mg consequently large electrostatic repulsion might have occurred between mfs and mg besides the large number of h ions might also have shown the competition with mg ions at lower phs leading to the lowered adsorption performance of mfs for mg on the contrary at higher ph the negative charge density on the mfs surface enhances due to deprotonation of oxygenous functional groups of mfs which might have favored due to electrostatic interactions the adsorption performance of mfs for mg dye therefore the removal of mg consequently increased with an increase of ph of solution 66 the maximum adsorption capacity of mfs for mg dye has been reported in the range ph 7 to 10 3 8 comparative analysis table 6 shows the comparison between the adsorption capacity of the prepared composite and other reported bioadsorbents under the influence of various parameters the comparison of q m and q e of the prepared composite with the other adsorbents and the magnetic character of the present adsorbent suggested that mfs is an effective adsorbent for mg removal from aqueous solution 4 conclusion and future prospects the preparation of magnetic flax seeds was carried out by following a simple co precipitation method the prepared composite was characterized by ft ir xrd sem edx and tem techniques the magnetic composite was porous with large numbers of functional sites the average crystallite size of the magnetic composite from xrd analysis was approximately 17 nm which was in good agreement with size obtained from tem analysis which depicted the size distribution in the range 1 14 3 nm the prepared composite was found suitable for malachite green removal from its aqueous solution the experimental investigation revealed that the composite has excellent removal efficiency for malachite green 1 0 g l 1 amount of the composite could remove approximately 90 of malachite green from its solution having 10 0 mg l 1 concentration within 15 min of reaction time at 30 c and 7 ph the equilibrium adsorption capacity of the tested composite for malachite green dye was found to be approximately 10 0 mg g 1 with qmax 52 910 mg g 1 the rate determining step of mg adsorption onto mfs was intraparticle diffusion possibly the weak electrostatic and h bonding interactions might be responsible for the malachite green adsorption onto the surface of magnetic composite mfs the results of this study revealed that a magnetic flax seed is efficient material for water treatment through adsorption technology however desorption and regeneration study of the present adsorbent should be addressed in future further in near future the pilot scale adsorption evaluation would be required with real industrial wastewater the effect of presence of microbes and other pollutants on the adsorption capacity of the present material should be addressed the anti microbial activity of the adsorbent should also be investigated so that the technique could be effective for biofilm

13484,the preparation of novel iron oxide flax seeds based hybrid nanocomposite referred to as magnetic flax seeds and its application for water treatment has been reported herein a simple co precipitation method was followed and the detailed mechanism of the preparation has been discussed the prepared magnetic flax seeds powder was characterized by employing several spectroscopic and microscopic techniques the characterization results showed that the magnetic nanocomposite possessed massive functional groups of flax seeds and hydroxyl groups of iron oxide the nanocomposite has a porous structure with particles size distributions in the range 1 14 32 nm the magnetic composite was investigated for adsorption utility in water treatment technology by picking malachite green dye under the effect of various process parameters such as ph contact time temperature concentration and amount of adsorbent the equilibrium adsorption capacity of the magnetic nanocomposite dosage 1 0 g

was proved feasible and endothermic at all the tested temperatures 30 50 c and concentrations 10 60 mg l 1 the adsorption data followed freundlich isotherm kf value 20 893 mg g 1 which suggested the multilayer physisorption process the kinetic investigation suggested a pseudo second order sorption process k2 0 050 g mg 1 min 1 and governed through particle diffusion the ease in preparation low cost magnetic characteristic and high adsorption capacity will make the water treatment technique more efficient with the magnetic flax seeds keywords water pollution malachite green adsorption composite magnetic flax seed 1 introduction the contamination of water with addition of dyes is most concerning subject for environmental agencies because large numbers of diseases are associated with the consumption of toxic dyes through water 1 moreover these dyes are highly visible and impart intense colour to the water on dissolution and hence can hamper the sunlight entry into water thus affect the aquatic life adversely 2 the toxic dyes even at low concentration adversely affect aquatic environment and can easily aggregate in the human body through food chain causing a variety of diseases and disorders 3 many dyes are found to be carcinogenic affect liver urinary bladder and intestines 4 among various dyes malachite green mg is most noxious carcinogenic and highly poisonous to the living cells 5 mg has a complex and rigid structure and acts as a tumor enhancing agent for the liver 6 therefore its removal from industrial effluents is mandatory before discharging into water sources however its removal from water is not easy therefore an effective method has to be developed for the same adsorption is one such method that is effective for dyes removal and involves low cost environmentally safe material synthesized with minimal waste disposal 7 also one can enhance the adsorption property of the materials by its modification through many ways to meet the desired need 8 several low cost adsorbents have been prepared and utilized for the removal of toxic colorants 9 nanoscience is a highly emerging area of science that involves the application of materials having size in the range 1 100 nm the term nano brought special shape size and alternative composition with unique physicochemical and biological properties in comparison to materials from which it is prepared 10 nanoparticles can be synthesized via various methods like co precipitation chemical reduction thermal reduction sol gel hydrothermal microemulsion ion scattering and sputtering laser ablation and sonochemical method 11 16 furthermore nanotechnology is a multidisciplinary technology and serves as a bridge between various disciplines of chemistry physics biology material science and medical science it changes the overall properties and improve structural thermal mechanical catalytic electrochemical chemical and physical properties in comparison to the bulk material it profoundly shows the application in degradation of organic pollutants antibiotics electrochemical hydrogen storage solid phase extraction drug delivery food processing agriculture production animal feed and in the biomedical sector 10 17 20 magnetically activated carbons have been reported as potential adsorbents for almost all kinds of colour imparting water pollutants 21 they can be effective for several adsorption desorption cycles with high regeneration power however activated carbon preparation needs high energy consumption and chemical activation which enhances the overall cost of the adsorption process 21 22 the recent target of research is to achieve low cost eco friendly and effective alternatives of magnetic activated carbons natural plant based magnetic materials such as seeds 22 leaves 23 etc have been proved more effective than magnetic activated carbon and fulfill the demand in every aspect 24 25 the insoluble cell walls of the plant s materials are made up of cellulose and hemicelluloses lignin tannins and structural proteins and or other phytochemicals that provide plenty of functional oxygen nitrogen containing groups which act as binding sites for metal ions mn during the preparation of composite materials 22 the preparation of several plant based such as seeds leaves sprouts gum mucilage and cellulose derived from plants composite materials have been reported 22 in all these composites the plant materials act as carbon frameworks on which nanoparticles have been grown for instance podder and majumder 26 used neem leaves as a common framework for several studies viz neem leaves mnfe2o4 composite biosorbent bacteria immobilization on neem leaves mnfe2o4 composite surface 27 bacillus arsenicus biofilms supported on a neem leaves mnfe2o4 composite 28 and corynebacterium glutamicum mtcc2745 biofilm supported on neem leaves mnfe2o4 composite 29 yuvaraja et al 2020a b 24 25 have reported the preparation of magnetic arachis hypogaea leaves and magnetic momordica charantia leaves respectively the black cumin seeds based mno2 30 mnfe2o4 31 fe2o3 zro2 32 and fe2o3 sno2 33 composites have been reported for dye removal abdulla et al 2019 and 2021 23 34 have reported the preparation of guava leaves based γ fe2o3 and ag ag2o zro2 gl composites for the water cleansing respectively similarly sawdust of syzygium cumini jamun tree in hindi has been utilized as a common framework for preparation of several composites viz sawdust mnfe2o4 composite 35 bacterial cells immobilized on sawdust mnfe2o4 composite 36 bacterial biofilm supported on sawdust mnfe2o4 composite 37 bacillus arsenicus mtcc 4380 biofilm supported on sawdust mnfe2o4 composite 38 and corynebacterium glutamicum mtcc 2745 immobilized on sawdust mnfe2o4 composite 39 all these composites had been utilized for the removal of pollutants from water hence the present study involving the preparation and application of magnetic flax seeds mfs is an extension of the previous researche carried out flax seeds fs have omega 3 fatty acids and are known as a super food that contains antioxidant substances like lignin and promotes hormonal balance improves digestion cardiovascular health and controls cholesterol moreover fs is a great source of dietary fiber minerals like manganese thiamine and magnesium and plant based protein 40 the utility of fs as a biosorbent has also been reported by other workers 41 42 and their use can make the water treatment process safe hygienic and effective in terms of cost adsorption efficiency and bulk generation of material therefore this work focuses the synthesis of mfs for the adsorptive removal of mg dye from water the batch adsorption experiments were performed to optimize reaction parameters to determine isotherm kinetic and thermodynamic parameters which are required to propose mechanism of the sorption process there is no study available in the literature on the preparation of magnetic flax seeds hence this is the first reported novel work 2 experimental the experimental procedure adopted for the preparation characterization and application of magnetic flax seeds for adsorption are given below in details 2 1 materials and chemicals reagents the materials and chemicals required for this study are discussed in the supplementary information file esi 2 2 synthesis of magnetic flax seeds the cleaned flax seeds fs powder was prepared following procedure as discussed in the literature 43 and then used to prepare its composite scheme 1 for preparation of mfs 1 0 g of fs powder was firstly dispersed in 100 ml of double distilled water ddw then 100 ml each of 0 5 m fe no3 3 9h2o and 0 25 m feso4 7h2o solutions were added slowly to the above beaker under continuous stirring at 500 rpm 44 45 after 30 min of further continued stirring the temperature of the aqueous mixture was raised to 50 5 c then drop wise alkali solution 4 0 m naoh was added to maintain the alkaline ph 10 to 10 5 at alkaline ph a black precipitate was obtained in the form of magnetic material fig 1 24 25 the precipitate was then magnetically separated washed with ddw several times and dried at 90 5 c for 24 h and referred as magnetic flax seed mfs the synthesized composite was characterized for physiochemical properties and then used for the adsorption application the magnetic character of the prepared sample can be seen from fig 2 2 3 instrumentation and characterization the physiochemical properties of the prepared magnetic sample were analyzed with the help of various characterization tools and techniques as discussed in the supplementary information file esi 2 4 mg adsorption experiments the adsorption performance of mfs was investigated in batch mode for laboratory prepared aqueous solution of malachite green mg dye the stock solution of mg was prepared by dissolving certain quantity in ddw and diluted as per requirement adsorption experiments were performed as discussed in the supplementary information file esi briefly 10 0 ml of mg dye solutions were taken in a series of 50 ml erlenmeyer flasks and after adding mfs subjected to adsorption experiments under the effect of variable parameters and then optimum conditions as discussed in the concerned result section the flasks were agitated mechanically on water bath shaker at 180 rpm the agitated aqueous solutions from each experimental set were centrifugated to remove mfs particles solid each solution was then subjected to the spectrophotometric analysis as discussed in the supplementary information file esi to determine the remained concentration of dye in the solution after sorption the adsorption performance of mfs for mg was determined by substituting data into the mathematical equations eqs s2 and s3 given in the supplementary information file esi 3 result and discussion the results of physiochemical analysis and adsorption experiments are given below 3 1 mechanism of preparation of mfs this study was conducted for achieving low cost material required for water treatment with easy preparation and good biocompatibility for this purpose a previously reported method was adopted with some modifications 27 it is well known that constituents in the plants extract react with the metal ions and ultimately form metal oxide nanoparticles in a single step process 46 the formation of nanoparticles in the presence of plant extract makes preparation of organic inorganic hybrid nanocomposites an easy and one step process recently various modifications have been made in the methods involved for the biological synthesis of nanoparticles and the bio precipitation step can be accelerated by adding naoh for instance prasad et al 2016 47 have produced iron iii oxide nanocrystals with leaf extract of garlic vine and used 1 0 m naoh solution to accelerate the bio precipitation of iron oxide similarly rao et al 2013 48 have reported the preparation of iron oxide nanoparticles using iron salts fe3 fe2 and the leaf extract of pomegranate and for accelerating the yield of iron oxide they have added 1 0 n naoh makarov et al 2014 49 have also reported the synthesis of iron oxide nanoparticles using aqueous extract of hordeum vulgare and rumex acetosa and they also revealed the role of ph in the stability of iron nanoparticles therefore the present study also reports the preparation of iron oxide in the presence of naoh which led to high precipitation of iron salts it has also been reported that co precipitation using naoh gives small particles 50 51 the preparation of fe3o4 under the same conditions as followed in the present study has also been reported by the yew et al 2016 67 who have used both kappaphycus alvarezii extract as well as naoh for the synthesis of kappaphycus alvarezii fe3o4 nps firstly a solution of fe3 and fe2 with a 2 1 m ratio was added into the seaweed extract to obtain a yellowish colloidal solution then the freshly prepared 1 0 m of naoh solution was added drop wise under continuous stirring to adjust ph 11 the solution was then stirred for 1 h to homogenize the solution and also for the completion of the reaction after that the as synthesized fe3o4 nps were separated by using a permanent magnet the fe3o4 nps were washed several times with deionized water the nanoparticles were dried in an oven at around 70 c for 24 h the scheme of preparation of fe3o4 has been explained as given below extract fe 2 aq fe 3 aq extract fe 3 fe 2 extract fe 3 fe 2 oh aq extract fe 3 o 4 s therefore for enhancing the yield of the product and to get small size nanoparticles to be incorporated in the carbon framework the naoh solution was added during the present synthesis naoh might had helped during the co precipitation of iron salts present on the surface of flax seeds the seed powder was not decanted from the reaction mixture during the preparation to achieve the low cost material with an easy one step preparation the reaction mechanism of the preparation of material can be justified as follows initially the presence of plenty of functional groups on the surface of flax seeds fs oh fs cooh might have provided the attractive sites to the metal ions fe2 and fe3 and adsorbed on its surface thereafter co precipitation reaction might have occurred and initialized with the formation of hydroxides of the metal ions the high concentration of naoh used during the reaction might have contributed large number of oh ions in the solution which might have been attracted by the metals ions fe2 and fe3 adsorbed on the fs powder substrate and formed the metal hydroxides m oh x afterwards the nucleation of m oh x might have proceeded on fs surface and ultimately formed their respective oxides scheme 1 the high concentration of oh ions might have been responsible for the fast nucleation and resulting into the generation of tiny nuclei thus low crystallite size production occurred 51 during the process the extract of the plant leaves might have also worked as capping agent by reacting with the iron ions giving small sized nanoparticles as the major feature of the plant extract is to prevent the agglomeration of nanoparticles 46 the biosynthesis of nanoparticles with plant extract and use of naoh has also been reported for the zinc oxide nanoparticles where 15 ml of leaf extract of calotropis and 2 m naoh was used 52 several studies can also be seen similar to the present study such as neem leaves mnfe2o4 27 magnetic arachis hypogaea leaves 24 and magnetic momordica charantia leaves 25 where leaves were not filtered and hence remained in the extract and then in situ incorporation of nanoparticles in the leaves were reported the similar method has been used for the preparation of magnetic soya bean sprouts fe3o4 sbs in almost the same temperature and ph conditions 44 therefore the literature validates the present preparation of magnetic nanocomposite 3 2 characterization the prepared composite was characterized by employing several spectroscopic and microscopic techniques as discussed below 3 2 1 ft ir analysis it is very common that organic frameworks have large numbers of functional groups such as hydroxyl carbonyl amide and carboxylic acid due to the presence of various phytochemical constituents these functional groups provide attractive sites for metal ions to interact with the surface of the carbon framework thus the formation of composite occurs due to the presence of large numbers of functional sites in principle the ft ir spectrum gives information about the functional groups present in the material based on the constituents for the present study the ft ir spectrum of mfs was compared with the ft ir spectrum obtained for fs seed powder fig 3 and table 1 the ft ir spectrum of fs powder fig 3a revealed the presence of numerous functional groups such as oh c o and nh etc in the carbon framework of seeds 53 these functional groups are majorly due to the cellulosic and protein constituents of the structure of seeds 24 25 the shifting in the ft ir bands accounted for the fs powder along with the appearance of new bands can be seen in the magnetic sample of fs powder table 1 new bands appeared at 616 to 466 cm 1 which was accounted for the stretching vibration of m o bonds some peaks also disappeared in the ft ir spectrum of mfs fig 3b hence the ft ir spectrum of mfs exhibited the frequencies accounted for fs with some shifting and disappearance and magnetic metal oxide feo particles fe2o3 or fe3o4 suggesting the strong interactions electrostatic and or non electrostatic between the magnetic nanoparticles and fs powder 54 therefore the ft ir spectrum studies of mfs suggested the growth of magnetic particles in the carbon framework of fs powder the ft ir spectrum of mg loaded mfs also have been shown in fig 3c the shifting in the ft ir bands assigned for mfs after the mg adsorption suggest the interaction between surface of mfs and mg and through electrostatic and or non electrostatic forces such as h bonding table 1 3 2 2 xrd analysis in general the peaks position in xrd pattern simply represent the fingerprint of the material regardless of the size the peak position in xrd pattern depends on the lattice parameters which are presented as angle and determined using bragg s law this issue is different in the different materials but similar for the similar materials the xrd spectrum of a powder should also be the same either that is in the bulk or nanomaterials as the chemical composition and bonding are the same regardless of the size of the particle grown some difference in the peak position can be seen only due to the internal stresses in materials this is very common physio chemistry of xrd analysis for this study the powder x ray diffraction pattern of fs powder was accounted for the carbon structure of seeds fig 4a the obtained xrd pattern for fs powder was almost similar to the xrd pattern of other organic contents reported by several research groups 55 57 all the reported diffraction peaks have been indexed to the structure of cellulose in natural plant materials the observed peaks could be assigned to the reflections from the 002 planes in the order of ascending 2θ values although the change in the intensities in xrd is attributed to the conditions of materials heat treatment light exposure and so on the p xrd pattern of mfs fig 4b revealed the characteristics peaks of iron oxide magnetite and or maghemite particles iop in the magnetic composite sample the similar pattern of p xrd has also been reported by other researchers 23 58 59 however the actual phase of iop was confirmed from the characteristic peaks of io found at the 311 plane for this xrd pattern the 2θ value corresponding to 311 plane appeared at 35 56 which is closure to the standard 2θ value of the magnetite fe3o4 at 35 423 the standard 2θ values of magnetite or maghemite is the basic features of these structures evaluated by xrd pattern 60 therefore the present xrd study showed the presence of fe3o4 in the mfs sample jcpds 39 1346 the average crystallite size of mfs was evaluated at approximately 17 015 nm using debye scherer equation eq s1 esi 3 2 3 sem edx and tem analysis sem is used for imaging the surface of the nanomaterial in a submicroscopic scale which gives the information of topography of the materials shape or structures for this study the sem images fig 5a showed and confirmed growth of iop onto the entire surface of seeds however the shape of iop were found to be irregular quasi spherical with various sizes the agglomeration of the particles can also be seen which might be attributed to the irregularities in the shape and size of the composite particles the sem images confirmed the porous structure of mfs composite the energy dispersive x ray edx analysis is a standard method for identifying and quantifying the elemental composition in a sample of material the elemental composition of mfs fig 5b was analyzed and found that the composite had 53 59 wt of fe 37 55 wt of o 7 85 wt of c and 1 01 wt of n the presence of oxygen o nitrogen n and carbon c in the sample might be due to the seeds and fe comes from the metal oxide grown in the seeds framework the tem is the best technique for analyzing the internal structure and size of the materials in nanometer scale the tem image for mfs fig 6a showed the growth of nps on the carbon framework of fs with quasi spherical shape agglomeration of particles can also be seen in tem image and these results suggested the well growth of metal oxide nps in the carbon framework of fs the tem histogram revealed the mean sizes of mfs nps as 7 9 nm with standard deviation of 2 5 nm and the size distribution of mfs nps ranges from 1 to 14 3 nm fig 6b 61 3 3 effect of experimental parameters on mg adsorption the four variables adsorbent dosage contact time ph and initial concentration of dye of the experiment were studied using one variable at a time ovat optimization method and the results have been concluded on the basis of adsorption capacity i e amount of mg adsorbed in milligram onto per gram of mfs an increase in the dosage of mfs 0 5 to 2 0 g l 1 in the mg solution of 10 mg l 1 concentration decreased the adsorption capacity of mfs by 5 0 mg g from 18 22 mg g 1 after 60 min contact time at 30 1 c and ph 7 0 fig 7 from the eq s2 it can be seen that the adsorption capacity of an adsorbent is inversely proportional to its amount therefore present trend was obtained on composite dosage variation for fixed concentration of mg in solution for further study 1 0 g l 1 dosage of mfs was used the effect of initial mg concentrations on the adsorption capacity of 1 0 g l 1 dosage of mfs was also analyzed for 60 min contact time the initial concentration of mg was varied from 10 to 60 mg l 1 and the corresponding results suggested the higher adsorption capacity of mfs at the higher mg concentrations fig 7 from the eq s2 it can be further seen that the adsorption capacity of an adsorbent is directly proportional to adsorbate concentration in the solution therefore the present trend was obtained for mg concentration variation in the aqueous solution for fixed amount of mfs it has been reported that the higher driving force of adsorbates at higher concentration is responsible for higher adsorption capacity of an adsorbent 60 it can also be clearly stated that the adsorption capacity of mfs for mg was higher at higher temperatures fig 8 and this trend was found for each concentration levels the higher adsorption capacity of mfs at higher temperatures suggested the endothermic nature of the sorption of mg onto the mfs surface it is well understood that the dye sorption is a temperature dependent process temperature alters the diffusion rate and at higher temperature the dye diffusion rate is higher which leads to the fast diffusion across the boundary external layer of the surface thus higher adsorption the similar result was obtained for the present mg sorption the higher probability of collision of mg to mfs surface and lower thickness of boundary layer of mfs at higher temperature might also be responsible for higher mg sorption at higher temperature 3 4 thermodynamics of mg adsorption to summarize the influence of temperature 30 50 c on mg sorption at different concentration levels 10 60 mg l 1 and corresponding mechanism the thermodynamic parameters such as gibbs free energy change δg enthalpy change δh and entropy change δs have been calculated using eqs s4 s7 esi table 2 at all the concentration levels the δh values was found to be positive which indicated the endothermic nature of the mg adsorption onto mfs the endothermicity of the sorption process might be due to the displacement of water molecules by mg during their sorption which suggested that the heat might have evolved during the sorption process the positive δs values were obtained which suggested the increase in the randomness at the interface of mfs solid surface and mg ion in the solution the higher values of δs suggested the higher extent of randomness at low concentration range moreover the δg values inferred that the reaction was feasible at every tested temperature range fig 9 the higher negative values of δg at higher temperature further suggested the favorability of adsorption process at higher temperature however at fixed temperature the δg value decreased on increasing concentration which indicated the higher extent of favorability of absorption process at lower concentration this result might be due to ease of availability of sorption sites at lower concentration for mg ions the above thermodynamic results can be justified from the published literature 62 63 3 5 isotherm studies of mg adsorption the equilibrium isotherm langmuir eq s8 and freundlich eq s9 parameters were estimated at three temperature levels of 30 40 and 50 c at ph 7 and given in table 3 the simulation plots were drawn for examining the best fitting isotherms model which indicated the well agreement of experimental adsorption capacity to freundlich adsorption capacity associated with the lower value of are error function as compared to langmuir adsorption capacity fig 10 this suggests the well establishment of freundlich isotherm model for mg adsorption onto mfs referred the physical adsorption of mg onto the heterogeneous surface of mfs accordingly the increasing order of k f values obtained from the freundlich model inferred the higher affinity between mfs and mg at higher temperature the obtained n values 2 8 4 0 further revealed the favorability of mg adsorption onto mfs surface the computed langmuir constant b and rl values eq s10 0 rl 1 supported the noticeable adsorption affinity and favorability of mg sorption onto mfs at all the tested temperatures 64 3 6 effect of contact time and adsorption kinetics as the contact time was increased from 15 to 120 min at interval of 15 min the adsorption capacity of mg onto mfs increased up to 60 min after that the plot became asymptotic with time axis fig 11 it happened because at the initial stage numerous active sites were available for mg ions to adsorb onto the mfs surface as the contact time was increased the availability of active sites on the surface of mfs decreased and the equilibrium reached at 60 min i e no more solute could be adsorbed onto the surface of the mfs the kinetics parameter can be evaluated using various kinetics models pfo eq s11 pso eq s12 elovich eq s13 weber morris eq s14 and boyd eq s15 the kinetics of mg 10 mg l 1 adsorption onto mfs 1 0 g l 1 was evaluated experimentally at 15 min time intervals of contact time ranging from 15 to 120 min at 30 c and ph 7 the acceptance of the selected kinetic models was evaluated from the values of r2 and other parameters table 4 as shown in table 4 the r2 value for pseudo second order plot was almost unity fig 12a which revealed the best fit of the experimental data for the adsorption of mg dye onto mfs with a good agreement between the maximum experimental and estimated adsorption capacity 64 thus the mg dye was expected to be bonded to mfs through weak electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding the interaction between the mg and adsorbent can be justified from the ftir spectrum of mg loaded mfs fig 3c as from elovich model fig 12b the much higher value of α 3 83 105 mg g 1 min 1 than the value of β 1 82 mg g 1 suggested that the rate of adsorption was much higher than the rate of desorption at equilibrium for mg adsorption onto the mfs 32 here in this study three straight lines can be seen in the weber morris wm plots fig 12c which accounted for the multistep three stage adsorption process table 5 the first step green line was achieved at the contact time range of 0 15 min which was accompanied with the fast adsorption process around 90 mg adsorption in 15 min due to the external mass transfer involving migration of mg from solution phase to the solid boundary of the adsorbent the second 30 to 60 min and third 75 to 120 min lines in the weber morris plot with c intercept values approximately 9 130 and 9 560 respectively which accounted to the slow stages of film diffusion and particle diffusion respectively the higher c value for third blue line suggested the slowest step of mg adsorption since the c value indicated the thickness of the boundary layer hence the higher value of c suggested the thick boundary layer therefore mg took more time to cross the boundary layer to reach to the adsorbent surface thus the particle diffusion step was a rate determining slow step for mg adsorption the boyd plot fig 12d also proved the particle diffusion as a slow step for mg adsorption onto the mfs surface 65 3 7 effect of solution ph the performance of mfs 1 0 g l 1 for mg 10 mg l 1 removal experimentally was also analyzed under the various ph environments acidic to alkaline and results are as shown in fig 13 the adsorption efficiency of mfs varied with change in ph of the mg solution the maximum performance of mfs was observed at alkaline ph in range 8 10 fig 13 the performance of mfs as a function of ph of mg solution can be justified by considering the pka value of mg dye and the charge on the surface of mfs the malachite green dye is available usually as chloride salt c6h5c c6h4n ch3 2 2 cl and in solution is dominantly positively charged which has pka value of 10 3 at lower ph the oxygenous functional groups on the mfs surface became protonated as proposed oh2 and cooh2 hence at lower ph the positive charge density enormously increased on mfs and also on mg consequently large electrostatic repulsion might have occurred between mfs and mg besides the large number of h ions might also have shown the competition with mg ions at lower phs leading to the lowered adsorption performance of mfs for mg on the contrary at higher ph the negative charge density on the mfs surface enhances due to deprotonation of oxygenous functional groups of mfs which might have favored due to electrostatic interactions the adsorption performance of mfs for mg dye therefore the removal of mg consequently increased with an increase of ph of solution 66 the maximum adsorption capacity of mfs for mg dye has been reported in the range ph 7 to 10 3 8 comparative analysis table 6 shows the comparison between the adsorption capacity of the prepared composite and other reported bioadsorbents under the influence of various parameters the comparison of q m and q e of the prepared composite with the other adsorbents and the magnetic character of the present adsorbent suggested that mfs is an effective adsorbent for mg removal from aqueous solution 4 conclusion and future prospects the preparation of magnetic flax seeds was carried out by following a simple co precipitation method the prepared composite was characterized by ft ir xrd sem edx and tem techniques the magnetic composite was porous with large numbers of functional sites the average crystallite size of the magnetic composite from xrd analysis was approximately 17 nm which was in good agreement with size obtained from tem analysis which depicted the size distribution in the range 1 14 3 nm the prepared composite was found suitable for malachite green removal from its aqueous solution the experimental investigation revealed that the composite has excellent removal efficiency for malachite green 1 0 g l 1 amount of the composite could remove approximately 90 of malachite green from its solution having 10 0 mg l 1 concentration within 15 min of reaction time at 30 c and 7 ph the equilibrium adsorption capacity of the tested composite for malachite green dye was found to be approximately 10 0 mg g 1 with qmax 52 910 mg g 1 the rate determining step of mg adsorption onto mfs was intraparticle diffusion possibly the weak electrostatic and h bonding interactions might be responsible for the malachite green adsorption onto the surface of magnetic composite mfs the results of this study revealed that a magnetic flax seed is efficient material for water treatment through adsorption technology however desorption and regeneration study of the present adsorbent should be addressed in future further in near future the pilot scale adsorption evaluation would be required with real industrial wastewater the effect of presence of microbes and other pollutants on the adsorption capacity of the present material should be addressed the anti microbial activity of the adsorbent should also be investigated so that the technique could be effective for biofilm
