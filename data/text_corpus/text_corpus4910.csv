24550,close to 40 of earth s land area is used for agriculture to provide humankind with plant and animal based food fibers or bioenergy future trends in agricultural land use livestock husbandry and associated environmental pressures are determined by developments in the food sector agricultural productivity technology and many other influencing factors scenario analysis helps to understand their complex interaction and obtain quantitative insight we here present an in depth description of the agricultural land use model biobam ghg 2 0 biobam designed for evaluating large numbers of agricultural and livestock production scenarios assembled on the basis of exogenous assumptions on food systems crop yields and other factors biobam determines the feasibility of specific parameter combinations and the corresponding greenhouse gas ghg emissions from agricultural activities livestock husbandry land use change and other activities we provide a description of the software environment the model s data structures input and output variables and model algorithms to illustrate the model s capabilities and the scope of model applications we describe two exemplary studies performed with biobam we assess implications of agro ecological innovations and the feasibility of their widespread application in order to illustrate their implications in terms of agricultural self sufficiency and ghg emissions this first case study aligns a small number of individual scenarios with qualitative storylines we also showcase a biophysical option space approach which represents a comprehensive sensitivity analysis regarding the multidimensional uncertainties inherent to main influencing parameters i e projections for diets and yields assumptions on cropland use for bioenergy and regarding grassland intensification the global potential of forest regeneration for climate change mitigation serves as an example for this second approach the option space comprises 90 scenarios and encompasses the full range of literature estimates on ghg mitigation from afforestation in 2050 0 5 7 gt co2 yr it further shows that the potential is zero under certain diet yield combinations assuming zero energy crop cultivation and global convergence to a healthy reference diet the sequestration potential of afforestation rises to 10 gt co2 yr in 2050 these exemplary applications illustrate how option spaces developed with biobam can complement scenario based assessments that usually focus on small numbers of individual scenarios option spaces shift attention to a wider scope of conceivable futures and thus support a comprehensive view on systemic relations and dependencies whereas analyses with few scenarios allow apprehension of much more detailed scenario narratives and qualifications keywords agriculture land use modelling food system integrated assessment model climate change afforestation 1 introduction 1 1 purpose and scope of agricultural land use modelling over the last 300 years global agricultural land has expanded fivefold ramankutty et al 2018 and today accounts for close to 40 of earth s land area fao 2021 agriculture has been the main cause for deforestation garcia et al 2020 kissinger et al 2012 williams 2006 and has also become a major contributor to environmental degradation springmann et al 2018 steinfeld et al 2006 tilman 1999 willett et al 2019 and climate change causing about one fifth of today s annual anthropogenic greenhouse gas ghg emissions arneth et al 2019 vermeulen et al 2012 wri 2021 in scientific research on the prospective development and impacts of agriculture scenario analysis has emerged as the major method to understand complex interactions between food systems agricultural production and environmental pressures at various scales see e g audsley et al 2006 fao 2018 poux and aubert 2018 st√ºrck et al 2018 wolf et al 2015 different modelling techniques are used for deriving scenarios including empirical statistical process or agent based approaches lambin et al 2000 economic optimization and equilibrium models are most widely applied in the scientific literature prominent examples for economic models include the gaps model global agriculture perspectives system kavallari et al 2016 used for deriving the scenarios of the food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao 2018 and the capri model common agricultural policy regionalised impact analysis model britz and witzke 2014 developed for assessing domestic and global effects of the european union s common agricultural policy e g britz and hertel 2011 pelikan et al 2015 wolf et al 2015 other important models include image rose et al 2011 stehfest et al 2009 globiom havlik et al 2018 2013 valin et al 2013 and magpie dietrich et al 2020 lotze campen et al 2010 which are parts of larger modelling frameworks called integrated assessment models iams and the impact model of the international food policy research institute robinson et al 2015 fig 1 illustrates the scope and purpose of the agricultural land use models as understood in the present context based on exogenous drivers like dietary changes population or economic development the demand for agricultural commodities comprising crops and agricultural products like meat or vegetable oil is determined demand side future developments of the relevant drivers are often adopted from authoritative studies or diverse pathways reflecting different expectations or world views are contrasted against each other as in the case of the shared socio economic pathways ssps see o neill et al 2017 roe et al 2019 the production side on the other hand is modelled on the basis of parameters like land cover crop yields agricultural practices e g conventional organic farming etc established models like globiom and magpie feature spatially explicit representations of land and are capable of modelling land use change based on economic considerations a core characteristic of such agricultural land use models is how a balance between demand and supply is established in economic partial equilibrium models like the abovementioned this is achieved through endogenous adjustments in market prices that ultimately lead to equality between supply and demand for each product havlik et al 2018 economic parameters like regionally diverse production costs and demand elasticity s influence the quantities and location of agricultural production and consumption usually assessing the impacts of agricultural production e g greenhouse gas ghg emissions land use change or derived parameters such as water consumption for irrigation represent the core aims of scenario development further scenario specific implications such as trade patterns changes in regional self sufficiencies are a direct outcome of the demand supply balancing algorithms biobam abbreviated for biomass balance model was designed as a biophysical accounting model that calculates the balance between biomass supply and biomass demand erb et al 2009a it follows a diagnostic approach erb et al 2016 based on exogenous trajectories for demand i e fixed demand as opposed to price elastic demand usually implemented in economic models and scenario specific restrictions on or limitations to land use change such restrictions include regulatory aspects e g protected areas and biophysical framework conditions e g suitability of grazing areas for crop production and can further reflect specific research questions e g which projections for diets are feasible in a world without further expansion of cropland areas the original focus of biobam was on determining the feasibility of various dietary projections with future land use and production patterns according to scenarios from authoritative institutions especially the food and agriculture organization of the united nations see fao 2018 the feasibility was determined by a mass balance approach 1 2 development history and design principles of biobam the original version of biobam biobam 1 0 erb et al 2009 was based on three consistent and spatially explicit databases for the year 2000 on land use erb et al 2007 biomass flows from harvest to use krausmann et al 2008 and human appropriation of net primary production haberl et al 2007a it was used amongst others to assess global biomass potentials for bioenergy erb et al 2012 haberl et al 2011 2010 and future option spaces for food and agriculture erb et al 2016 by combining various projections for crop variants yields livestock efficiencies human diets etc under different limitations for cropland expansion and grazing intensity it was used to calculate global biomass supply demand balances for 500 scenarios of the global agro food system in 2050 erb et al 2016 the results were combined to a biophysical option space of feasible futures in which demand for cropland products matches supply by at least 95 considering a 5 uncertainty range and grazing intensities on grassland the ratio of grazed or mowed biomass to actually prevailing net primary productivity stay below ecological thresholds biobam 1 0 was entirely implemented in microsoft excel had rigid data structures comprising for example 11 world regions and 14 biomass demand categories see e g erb et al 2016 and accounted for a limited number of environmental pressures such as land use intensity and total biomass appropriation but not for key pressures and impacts such as ghg emissions biobam 1 0 produced snapshot i e single year scenarios and was designed to explore a broad range of conceivable futures regardless of what is considered likely or desirable from the present perspective agricultural land was not allowed to encroach into forests zero deforestation assumption and trade quantities between world regions was computed solely on the basis of biophysical parameters and resulting supply and demand relations in biobam 1 0 trade was not influenced by historical trade patterns a core difference to economic models with similar scope as well as the sustainability and organic livestock model solm m√ºller et al 2020 that has been maintained to the current version of biobam biobam was subsequently expanded to include greenhouse gas ghg emissions from agricultural production livestock husbandry and land use change luc building on the option space developed in erb et al 2016 the extended model biobam ghg is suitable for feasibility assessments of global food system scenarios complemented with ghg balances a study performed with biobam ghg theurl et al 2020b shows that human and livestock diets are the main determinant of ghg emissions with highest ghg emissions found for scenarios including high meat demand especially if focused on ruminant meat and milk whereas gains in crop yields are of minor significance another application of biobam ghg is presented in kalt et al 2020 an assessment of global agricultural bioenergy potentials based on latest crop yield and diet scenarios issued by fao 2018 by applying biobam ghg systemic ghg effects of providing agricultural biomass for energy which are often overlooked in bioenergy potential assessments haberl 2013 are quantified we here report on further developments towards biobam ghg 2 0 these were motivated by three core aims first to provide flexibility in terms of geographical resolution i e being able to develop scenarios on various scales ranging from world regional to sub national level timeframes and milestone years i e calculating scenario results for intermediate years not just one specific target year as in biobam 1 0 and data structures such as the number and aggregates of considered crops and agricultural products and their conversion processes e g feed conversion rates of agricultural animal products fcrs second to support variations in model algorithms reflecting different rationales of scenario development or addressing specific research questions e g unimpeded global trade vs self sufficiency ambitions in specific regions maintaining current regional production patterns of animal products vs re distribution based on for example biophysical potentials for ruminant grazing and third to implement the model in an adequate and efficient software environment that enables the calculation of large numbers of scenarios with high regional resolution while maintaining easy to use input data handling and scenario management via standardized ms excel worksheets biobam ghg 2 0 represents the successful implementation of these aims this paper provides a description of the software environment its data structures input and output variables and model algorithms methods section to illustrate the scope of possible research questions we further describe two exemplary model applications discuss technical aspects of the respective approaches and present selected scenario results results section a discussion and conclusions section concludes the main article comprehensive descriptions of input and output parameters as well as mathematical model descriptions are provided in the supplementary information si to this article 2 methods 2 1 concepts of scenario development for illustrating the basic concepts of scenario development supported by biobam we assume various exogenous data for 3 input parameters a b and c fig 2 the input data are generally differentiated by region and are time dependant i e represented by individual time series for each region for example parameter a may represent population development b diets and c projections for crop yields three variants are assumed for each input parameter in fig 2 the most common scenario approach in scientific literature is to develop a small number of individual scenarios case a where only certain combinations of parameter settings are considered in contrast the option space approach biobam is designed for case b is characterized by combining all available parameter settings leading to large numbers of scenarios because every particular combination of assumptions on all input parameters defines one scenario the analysis of an option space can focus on the feasibility of the various scenarios as in erb et al 2016 or certain quantitative results such as total or disaggregated greenhouse gas emissions as dependent on variations of specific input parameters as in theurl et al 2020 whereas the interpretation of single scenarios is usually not in focus of such studies for some parameters only certain combinations of parameter settings are possible for example changes in livestock systems may imply different feed compositions as well as changes in manure management in such situations changes in feed composition and manure management parameters e g emission factors need to be coupled resulting in a reduced option space where only certain parameter combinations of b and c are considered see case c in fig 2 in this sense case a which is characterized by few individual scenarios with certain parameter combinations can be understood as a special case of an option space where only coupled parameter settings occur although biobam is designed for large numbers of scenarios up to several hundred scenarios being calculated in parallel it supports parameter coupling for all dynamic input data and can also be applied for calculating individual scenarios see section 3 2 2 software environment and data handling the version of biobam presented here biobam ghg 2 0 was implemented in mathworks matlab version r2018a format with data export from and import to ms excel realized with vba macros input data see fig 3 include model run settings structural settings regional units commodity definitions and their characteristics etc biophysical data like areas and crop yields and various parameters for calculating impacts primarily ghg emissions the matlab code is structured into three phases 1 initialization including data import data validity and completeness checks interpolation etc 2 main model algorithm calculating scenario results and 3 post processing preparation of export tables export to csv files exported data tables are arranged in a way suitable for pivot tables in order to allow efficient and flexible data handling in ms excel fig 3 provides further information on the respective sub routines complete lists of input and results variables are provided in the si 2 3 data structures 2 3 1 space biobam supports three layers of geographical units layer 1 3 in the present default dataset these layers are sub national administrative divisions nuts1 2 regions in the eu layer 3 countries and world regions for non eu countries currently no sub national level data are available thus the sub national and the country layer layer 2 are identical the main model algorithms are performed on the highest geographic detail level units on this level are referred to as regions regardless of whether they correspond to sub national divisions as is the case for the eu or countries all non eu countries and the structure of geographic layers as region structure the main advantage of geographic layers is simplified input and output data handling most input data can be specified on either layer in order to be inherited to the respective sub units in the course of data pre processing for example human diets are usually provided on country level or data on manure management systems on world regional level layer 1 due to the absence of more detailed information if needed however the model is capable of implementing specific data on layer 2 or 3 certain input data such as agricultural areas or population must be provided on regional level since they are defining characteristics of each region see si for a full list of input parameters and their characteristics similarly model results can be displayed for each element at all layers further regional groupings that are entirely independent from the layered region structure are trade clusters and groups of regions for results evaluation trade clusters are groups of regions that maintain intensive trade relations e g all nuts2 regions within the eu the definition of trade clusters which is flexible and can be amended in concordance with particular research questions influences production patterns and in effect regional trade balances for crops and agricultural products see section 2 4 depending on the research question and scenario design trade clusters may be identical to layers but can basically be defined as any aggregate of layer 3 units trade within clusters is prioritized over imports from or exports to regions outside of the respective cluster to emulate trade relationships at different levels two layers of trade clusters may be defined e g all sub national regions of country as first layer and international free trade areas as second layer model results sometimes need to be interpreted for regional groupings that do not correspond to the regional layers e g country groups representing northern southern eastern and western europe as in r√∂√∂s et al 2020 to make results readily available for any such groupings in the results sheets especially ratio values or indicators that cannot be simply aggregated like self sufficiency or land use intensity it is possible to designate regional groupings for results evaluation 2 3 2 time all calculations in biobam are performed on annual level the timeframe is defined in the model settings by specifying a base year a final year and optional intermediate years for example in the first application presented in section 3 1 we considered one intermediate year 2030 between the base year 2012 and the final year 2050 final and intermediate years are referred to as scenario years all considered years as milestone years all model outputs are calculated for each milestone year all exogenous input data must be provided for the base year for the sake of convenience in input data handling data input for intermediate years and the final year is optional and missing values are filled during the initialization routine based on inter extrapolation rules if no scenario data are provided for a certain input parameter base year data are assumed to remain constant if input data are provided for at least two milestone years the missing data are obtained through interpolation 2 3 3 commodities with regard to crops biobam differentiates between crop types and crop groups for example crop types are cultivar species like wheat and maize which are grouped to the crop group cereals parameters like yields nitrogen contents or residue to crop ratios are defined on the level of crop types for diets feed conversion rates fcrs etc crop groups are used this allows for flexibility in diets fcrs depending on which crop types are available within the region or as imports the composition of crop groups used as food or feed may vary this approach aligns well with the level of detail used in typical reference diets in literature reference diets are usually composed of categories like cereals or roots and do not specify crop species despite differences in nutrient contents between crops types in such broad groups the full list of crop types and crop groups implemented in the most recent version of the model is provided in the si besides crops agricultural commodities represented in biobam include grass crop residues straw stover etc and agricultural products grass is produced on permanent and temporary grassland grazing areas and on temporary cropland i e fodder leys and is just like crop residues an optional component of livestock diets primarily of ruminants crop residues are characterized by crop specific parameters residue to crop ratios nitrogen contents and suitability as animal feed agricultural products are secondary commodities like meat and milk they primarily include animal products but other commodities like liquid biofuels may also be modelled as agricultural products a common feature of all agricultural products is that they are produced from primary commodities crops residues and or grass and thus characterized by exogenously defined primary commodity to product conversion factors livestock production is thus modelled as processes converting feed to specific products cf bouwman et al 2005 herrero et al 2013 wirsenius 2003 the conversion factors are in this context referred to as feed conversion ratios fcrs and correspond to exogenous defined livestock diets 2 4 model algorithms the following sections explain the algorithms for matching crop supply with demand section 2 4 1 for modelling land use change 2 4 2 and for determining regional production patterns of agricultural products like meat or milk 2 4 3 the calculation of ghg emissions is largely based on ipcc default methods and thus not explained in detail here see si for mathematical descriptions and specific data sources n2o emissions are addressed briefly in connection with the methods regarding nitrogen cycles section 2 4 4 the demand for agricultural commodities is determined by parameters such as population diets and fcrs which are dynamic and region specific exogenous input data due to regional variations in production side parameters e g yields fcrs the regional distribution of production has an influence on total land requirements and resulting parameters like land conversion the model algorithms for determining the regional distribution of agricultural production are thus central to all model outcomes they are explained in the subsequent sub sections 2 4 1 matching crop supply with demand in biobam the algorithms for determining production quantities and their regional distribution are exclusively based on biophysical parameters such as agricultural areas yields fcrs area expansion allowances etc these are external input data obtained from statistical databases spatial explicit information projections from authoritative studies or self derived scenario specific assumptions see table s1 in the si 1 1 this is a major difference to partial equilibrium models where crop supply and demand are brought into equilibrium by mimicking market mechanisms the regional distribution of crop production in such models is determined by economic parameters i e production costs linked to site specific conditions such as crop yields and labor costs optimization algorithms ensure that supply meets demand at the lowest possible overall costs while respecting model and or scenario specific constraints e g maximum or minimum allowed area shares for each crop type boundaries to self sufficiencies maximum change rates see dietrich et al 2020 havlik et al 2018 with crop demand being determined by exogenous data and run settings distribution approaches crop production is adjusted to demand situations by straightforward calculation steps based on regional production potentials i e available cropland and regionally diverse yields to be able to replicate future production patterns according to scenarios from authoritative institutions e g fao 2018 biobam supports the definition of initial ex ante production patterns implemented as exogenous cropland areas per region and crop ex ante cropland allocation serves as initial situation for adjusting production to demand in scenario years fig 4 shows a schematic illustration of the interrelations between exogenous input data and parameters calculated within the model the calculations are performed for each region individually supply side calculations left part of fig 4 are performed on the level of crop types and aggregated to crop groups demand side calculations right part are entirely on crop group level as diets and fcrs are defined on the basis of crop groups the ex ante crop group balance the difference between ex ante supply and demand relevant on regional and global level is a main parameter for the subsequent supply demand matching algorithm ex ante cropland allocation may be omitted altogether it depends on the scenario design and the underlying narratives whether ex ante allocation is indicated for example for a business as usual scenario where significant changes in production and trade patterns are considered unlikely choosing constant ex ante crop shares in each region makes sense in contrast a research question that depends on considering reduced international trade flows and more regional self sufficiency can better be addressed without ex ante allocation as this results in stronger influence of regional demand on production patterns see scenarios in section 3 1 having determined the ex ante crop group balance for each layer 3 region the supply demand matching algorithm is executed it attempts to bring supply and demand into equilibrium by simply adjusting crop production quantities within the limits of biophysical feasibility and cropland expansion allowances exogenous data the individual steps of the algorithm that is performed for each milestone year and each scenario in parallel using multi dimensional matrices are explained in table 1 model run settings determine whether individual steps of the balancing algorithms are executed or not thereby influencing crop production patterns for example preference for supply from within the region or within trade clusters can be deactivated resulting in the steps 2 or 3 and 4 respectively to be skipped the program then proceeds directly to the next higher spatial level at each spatial level crop deficits are reduced as far as possible by allocating area to the production of crops that are in deficit this allocation is performed in a way that does not prioritize certain crop groups over others if insufficient cropland is available to cover the deficits of all crop groups at a certain spatial level the allocation algorithm ensures that all deficits are reduced in equal shares finally step 6 the allocation of crop groups to cropland in each region is definite if crop deficits remain the scenario is found to be infeasible 2 4 2 land use land use change and carbon stocks the following land use categories are represented in the model cultivated cropland fallow cropland grazing land broken down by grassland classes of different productivity and grazing suitability see erb et al 2016 and regenerated vegetation forest shrub land etc and unproductive areas settlements infrastructure on areas formerly used as agricultural land the representation of land in the base year is limited to cropland and grazing land as deforestation for agricultural land expansion has so far been disregarded in model applications zero deforestation assumption see erb et al 2016 land use in the base year is exogenous and based on statistical databases and maps e g erb et al 2007 eurostat 2021 fao 2021 2018 land use change in scenario years is determined by agricultural demand land characteristics e g suitability of grazing land as cropland and scenario specific assumptions such as maximum allowed cropland expansion table 2 summarizes the relevant types of land use change and their effects on carbon c stocks the calculation of c stock is based on the components biomass litter and soil and largely consistent with ipcc methods and default parameters e g soil and litter c stocks are assumed to require 20 years until they are in a new equilibrium state annual amount of co2 emissions or removals resulting from this c stock change extending over a twenty year period is in accordance with ipcc tier 1 principles assumed constant the currently implemented regional parameters are based on ipcc climate zones ecosystem zones and soil maps see ipcc 2006 batjes 2010 fao 2012 and thus reflect regional variation in temperature precipitation and soil types see si for a detailed explanation unproductive areas are only considered to reflect loss of agricultural land to built up area infrastructure etc vegetation regrowth is basically assumed to occur naturally if agricultural land is permanently left idle on cropland vegetation regrowth usually corresponds to forest regrowth due to the climatic conditions on most of the world s cropland areas but may also represent conversion to shrub land or other vegetation types with relatively low c stock the regionally specific c accumulation curves are supplied to the model as exogenous time series on annual level see si in comparison to the comprehensive statistics on global cropland use and productivity data on grassland productivity and utilization are sparse even for regions with good agricultural statistics such as the eu in biobam roughage supply potentials from grassland are calculated from regional specific net primary productivity npp data and maximum sustainable grazing intensities defined as the ratio of grazing harvest to actual productivity see erb et al 2016 fetzel et al 2017 kalt et al 2020 petz et al 2014 grazing intensities gi characterize the intensity of grassland use and vary from zero to the maximum sustainable value gimax to account for different grassland qualities i e variability in npp and maximum grazing intensities within regions grassland is split into quality classes each class is characterized by its area and regional specific npp and gimax values differences in nutritional values of grass grass qualities cf van hal et al 2019 are accounted for by converting dry matter quantities to equivalents of high quality grass grassland use in the base year is defined by data from livestock statistics and empirical data on fcrs i e by calculating the grass intake of livestock under consideration of feed intake from cropland sources grazing intensities are thus derived from consumption quantities and the available grazing land we assume that grass supply from the different classes is proportional to their respective production potentials taking palatability and accessibility constraints into account fetzel et al 2017 haberl et al 2007a for scenario years the default assumption is that the grazing intensity continues to be determined by the demand changes in grazing intensities over time cause c stock changes two optional algorithms have been implemented to develop different scenarios regarding grassland use a to simulate grassland abandonment in case of decreasing demand it can be assumed that gi may not decrease below the base year value if this were to happen parts of the grassland area are abandoned see table 2 b the optional setting universal grazing intensification results in grass supply being concentrated to the most productive areas thereby freeing up less productive grassland for vegetation regrowth usually forest regeneration see section 3 2 technically this is achieved by setting the gi of all grassland classes to gimax and reducing the area to the minimum extent required to supply the grass demand areas of low productivity grassland classes are reduced first highly productive grazing areas last depending on exogenous scenario assumptions on diets fcrs loss of agricultural land etc as well as the regional distribution approach applied for animal products see next section the gi required to supply the demand in a certain region may exceed the maximum sustainable threshold gimax by default it is assumed that grass is not traded between regions in this case the result is a regional grazing infeasibility the occurrence of regional grazing infeasibilities indicates that the mass balances in this scenario are not closed however this does not necessarily mean that the scenario or model run is useless as long as this partial inconsistency between supply and demand is taken into account in the interpretation regional infeasibilities sometimes provide valuable insight e g for determining regions where it is impossible to maintain current livestock production quantities if the use of concentrate feed is phased out see theurl et al 2020a 2 4 3 agricultural product distribution regional production patterns of animal production and other secondary commodities are not necessarily linked to regional resource availability naylor et al 2005 livestock husbandry particularly in intensive systems is often largely based on concentrate feeds from other regions countries and continents social economic and other influencing parameters on regional production patterns see e g robinson et al 2014 steinfeld et al 2006 are beyond the scope of the model thus we developed different approaches for deriving regional production patterns for agricultural products that are suitable for different contexts or research questions table 3 provides an overview and brief explanations for these approaches the respective algorithms distribute the global demand corresponding to the global target production amongst all geographic regions they are thus referred to as distribution approaches 2 4 4 nitrogen cycle and n2o emissions nitrogen cycles are a relatively complex aspect of the model that have a considerable impact on ghg emissions via various mechanisms a simplified illustration of the related calculation routines which are performed for each region individually is provided in fig 5 calculations related to nitrogen cycles on cropland are located in the left part of the figure those related to the livestock sector in the right part nitrogen removals from cropland comprise harvested crops and crop residues permanently removed from the field mainly residues used as feed straw used for livestock bedding is assumed to be returned to the field nitrogen inflows include livestock manure available for field application atmospheric deposition biological nitrogen fixation and synthetic fertilizer application for the base year synthetic fertilizer use is available from fao statistics together with the other inflows and removals calculated within the model this exogenous data is used to derive regionally specific nitrogen use efficiencies nues cf eu nitrogen expert panel 2016 lassaletta et al 2014 nues are by default assumed to remain constant in each region hence for scenario years nues are known parameters and can be used for deriving future synthetic fertilizer requirements assumptions on future nue developments can also be implemented via regionally specific exogenous change factors it is thus assumed that synthetic fertilizer is applied for balancing the gap between the required amount of nitrogen and organic nitrogen sources this practice however is only feasible in conventional agriculture whereas in organic farming the use of synthetic fertilizer is prohibited dabbert et al 2004 ma and joachim 2006 sanders 2013 to be able to consider this limitation and investigate its relevance in scenarios with high shares of organic farming see section 3 2 a separate nitrogen balance is calculated for areas under organic farming biological fixation of catch crops and under sown crops is considered as additional nitrogen source on organic farming areas the model determines whether a closed nitrogen balance is possible and calculates the size of an eventual nitrogen deficit for each region nitrogen inputs to cropland in the form of synthetic fertilizers residues and manure determine soil n2o emissions the corresponding algorithms and default emission factors are derived from ipcc guidelines ipcc 2019 mathematical descriptions for nitrogen related algorithms and emissions are provided in the si 2 4 5 further model features and validation of base year results apart from the abovementioned co2 emissions from carbon stock changes and n2o emissions from manure management and managed soils the following ghg sources are considered in biobam methane emissions from enteric fermentation in livestock manure management and rice cultivation nitrous oxide emissions from residue burning and ghg emissions from field operations and synthetic fertilizer production upstream emissions further model outputs that are useful for characterizing scenario developments include self sufficiency indicators calculated for all geographic entities of interest layers 1 3 and further regional groupings defined for this specific purpose apart from self sufficiencies with individual crops and agricultural products total crops and total harvested biomass potential self sufficiencies are provided for each milestone year calculated as the ratio of available agricultural area to the area required for supplying the intra regional demand it gives insight into the attainable degree of self sufficiency irrespective of the specific production patterns emerging in the considered scenario as a simplified indicator for human appropriation of net primary productivity hanpp see erb et al 2009 haberl et al 2013 2007b biobam further calculates the ratio of total biomass harvest in each spatial entity relative to the total potential net primary productivity on the used agricultural area exogenous data this indicator is suitable as a proxy for assessing trends in biodiversity pressures see haberl et al 2005 mayer et al 2021a vaƒçk√°≈ô et al 2016 a comparison of ghg emission results from biobam for the base year 2012 with datasets in literature e g crippa et al 2019 fao 2020 herrero et al 2013 performed as a means of model validation yields the following insight differences amongst literature data are often considerable mainly due to different methods and sometimes inconsistent data bases mainly in the global south on world regional level biobam results for the most relevant ghg emission categories enteric fermentation and manure management are mostly within the ranges of literature data for regions with high data quality such as europe or north america the different calculations methods applied in biobam based on livestock feed intake see si and faostat based on livestock heads see tubiello et al 2015 produce very similar results larger differences are found for regions like sub saharan africa or south eastern asia where data uncertainties are generally higher and different methods exacerbate data inconsistencies a comprehensive comparison of biobam results with literature data on world region level is provided in the si section 3 1 3 exemplary model applications we present two exemplary model applications to demonstrate how biobam is used to investigate concrete research questions the first application is an individual scenario approach with one business as usual scenario and four scenarios characterized by an expansion of agro ecological practices in the eu the second one an option space approach investigating global potentials for forest regeneration as climate mitigation measure under different food system pathways the following sections provide brief descriptions of these exemplary model applications the complete scenario results are available from zenodo data repositories kalt et al 2021 mayer et al 2021b 3 1 scenarios for agro ecological practices in the eu in the research project uniseco schwarz 2020 biobam is applied for developing quantitative scenarios to storylines about expansion of agro ecological farming practices the storylines developed as part of a co creation process with stakeholders primarily differ with regard to two dimensions 1 the level of implementation of agro ecological practices and 2 the localisation of the food system i e the evolution of international trade within the eu and globally the full storylines their rationale and the process of developing them are described in r√∂√∂s et al 2020 and the purpose to bring them into this paper is purely to illustrate how biobam can be used to model biophysical results of such narratives thus this section gives only a brief overview of the storylines and how they have been implemented in the model this includes variations in model algorithms e g agricultural product distribution approaches trade cluster settings as well as in input data table 4 although the scope of the performed model runs is global the focus of this scenario analysis is on the eu and thus selected results are presented for the eu broken down by countries the business as usual bau storyline describes a future in which globalization of the eu food system and the specialization of farming systems and regions continues this is implemented by projecting base year characteristics into the future ex ante crop shares as well as the production distribution of agricultural product in 2050 correspond to those in 2012 the eu is defined as one trade cluster within a global food system diets are not substantially changed but follow current trends bau scenario according to fao 2018 and there are no changes in fcrs the second storyline titled agro ecology for exports aeexp assumes a future where humanity counts on technological progress to achieve sustainable development agro ecological practices are a means to produce high value foods for trade between eu member states but also for exports to newly affluent foreign economies the technical implementation is similar to the previous one and includes a fixed distribution of animal products production amongst world regions in contrast to the implementation of bau production patterns within the eu are allowed to shift regionally this is necessary to facilitate a second characteristic of the storyline implementation agro ecological ruminant husbandry is achieved through substituting concentrate feed with grass thus production is required to shift towards regions with high grassland potentials further characteristics include improved fcrs of monogastrics and corresponding to the narrative of the aeexp storyline higher cropland expansion allowance up to 70 in nuts2 regions with sufficient suitable land available for conversion to cropland high cropland expansion allowance is also a feature of the third storyline called localization for protectionism lfp set in a future with increasing rivalry between nations nationalism and regional conflicts it is characterized by individual countries aiming for reduced dependence on imports current regional patterns are thus broken up and agricultural production is primarily determined by national demand core aspects of the technical implementation are an omitted ex ante allocation of cropland i e crop production is first of all determined by national demand and demand based production of animal production within each individual country these settings reflecting societies that favour local national production over imports are also applied for the last two storylines called localization for sustainability lfs and local agro ecological food system laesyst however in these scenarios the driving force behind local food systems is the ambitious pursuit of sustainability goals this is further reflected in more sustainable diets and reduced food wastes laesyst features a high 50 share of organic or ae farming another characteristic of laesyst is that pressure on cropland is reduced by substituting ruminant for monogastric animal products and a shift to largely grass based ruminant diets selected scenario results are presented on country level in fig 6 in the bau scenario the production of crops and animal products in the eu increase significantly in practically all countries facilitated by crop yield improvements and cropland expansion this is a consequence from rising global demand caused by population dynamics as well as changes in diets the self sufficiency with crops as well as agricultural greenhouse gas emissions rise in most countries in eleven countries by more than 50 2 2 note that the shares of manure management systems are assumed to remain constant and technical measures for reducing ghg emissions in livestock systems are disregarded the aeexp scenario shows comparatively moderate changes in crop production quantities mainly due to a shift from concentrate feed to grass hence the demand for feed crops within europe declines significantly but is compensated partly by additional production for direct human nutrition to facilitate largely grass based ruminant livestock systems livestock breeding is transferred to regions with large underused grazing potentials such as spain portugal or the baltics fig 6b changes in crop self sufficiencies are similar to those in bau the total ghg emissions in the eu dominated by ch4 emissions from enteric fermentation show only minor changes as compared to 2012 due to major changes in the distribution of livestock production ghg emissions in spain portugal greece austria and croatia rise significantly by a factor of two to three whereas other countries like belgium netherlands france germany denmark and sweden experience considerable reductions by 48 to 95 in the three local production scenarios lfp lfs laesyst imports and exports are cut significantly especially those of animal products if human diets follow a business as usual trajectory lfp re orientation on local food systems implies a slight reduction in the total production of animal products crop production and ghg emissions from livestock production and agricultural activities remain relatively constant in most countries however a reduction in ruminant livestock and efficiency gains in fcrs result in large grassland areas being abandoned the resulting vegetation regrowth creates a considerable carbon sink that offsets much of the agricultural emissions total ghg emissions including carbon stock effects thus decline to 23 of the level in 2012 the agriculture and land sector can even become a strong net carbon sink if europeans cut food wastes by 50 and switch to healthy diets with significantly less consumption of animal products as assumed in lfs and laesyst in these local production scenarios the livestock sector shrinks by 70 leading to a considerable decrease in feed crop demand downsizing crop production is thus possible without reducing the crop self sufficiency within the eu in laesyst crop demand is further reduced by favouring ruminant products from grassland based livestock systems over cropland based animal products this reduces pressure on cropland and opens additional space for agro ecological practices but also results in higher ghg emissions than in lfs 3 2 forest regeneration for climate change mitigation forest regeneration on agricultural areas or afforestation has recently raised considerable attention as a natural climate solution in scientific literature bastin et al 2019 doelman et al 2019 fuss et al 2018 griscom et al 2017 humpen√∂der et al 2014 kreidenweis et al 2016 lenton 2014 although results on its global ghg mitigation potential differ widely from 0 5 to 7 gt co2 yr in 2050 fuss et al 2018 lenton 2014 forest regeneration is widely regarded as a promising long term option for sequestering co2 from the atmosphere however previous assessments did not investigate the relevance of main influencing parameters on the size of areas available for afforestation e g human diets crop yields in a systematic way moreover the latest yield and diet projections according to fao 2018 have so far not been considered in such assessments we here present an option space application of biobam which is based on these fao projections allowing to assess the influence of these influencing factors on future afforestation potentials further option space dimensions include the demand for energy crops which is expected to grow considerably and thus create a significant additional demand for cropland in many climate stabilization scenarios see roe et al 2019 and grassland intensification three variants of energy crop demand development are assumed zero demand medium demand 283 million hectare mha cropland in 2050 is based on the ssp2 scenario and high demand 724 mha in 2050 on the ssp5 scenario according to rogelj et al 2018 besides diet projections from fao 2018 we consider scenarios with global convergence to the healthy and sustainable eat lancet reference diet willett et al 2019 and to a healthy vegan diet according to usda and hhs 2010 the grassland variants are no intensification default assumption see section 2 4 2 and universal intensification where grazing intensities are increased to the maximum sustainable value to make land available for afforestation all scenarios are based on a medium projection for population development according to ssp2 see fricko et al 2017 3 3 various projections for population development according to ssp1 2 and 5 were considered for the option space but finally omitted due to their minor influence in comparison to other parameters while fuss et al 2018 quantify mitigation potentials in literature with annual values referring to 2050 we here focus on cumulative amounts from 2012 to 2050 the corresponding annual values are provided in the si fig 7 a shows cumulative co2 sequestration due to afforestation for all 90 scenarios and panel b the total cumulative luc emissions sequestration the co2 sequestration due to afforestation ranges from 0 in scenarios based on the stratified societies scenario sss fao 2018 and high energy crop demand to about 650 gt co2 equivalent gt co2e in a scenario with vegan diets crop yields according to the towards sustainability scenario tss universal grassland intensification and zero energy crop demand in scenarios with fao based diets up to 334 gt co2e are sequestered until 2050 if grassland use is intensified globally without intensification on grassland the upper limit is reduced to 101 gt co2e hence grassland intensification represents a key lever for unlocking the carbon mitigation potential of afforestation in scenarios with high energy crop demand the afforestation potential is reduced significantly to a maximum of 16 gt co2e without and 130 gt co2e with grassland intensification assuming fao based diets this result highlights the trade off between afforestation and large scale bioenergy deployment fig 7b shows the total cumulative co2 emissions sequestration from luc besides c stock changes from afforestation they also include the effects of grassland conversion to cropland changes in grazing intensities and shifts in cultivated crops e g towards perennial tree crops like fruits and nuts see table 2 in most fao diet scenarios without grassland intensification the co2 benefits from afforestation are more than compensated by these other land use changes however under the condition of universal grassland intensification the land sector becomes a net c sink in most scenarios although grassland intensification also results in c stock losses on grassland its net effect is clearly favourable in fao diet scenarios with medium energy crop demand the cumulative co2 emissions until 2050 amounts to 77 203 gt co2e the option space further illustrates that global convergence to healthy or vegan diets would increase the afforestation potential significantly under these assumptions the land sector could supply a high energy crop demand and still become a net carbon sink during 2012 2050 4 discussion and conclusions many of the most difficult and pressing global sustainability challenges cf o neill et al 2018 rockstr√∂m et al 2009 are strongly related to agriculture √∂born et al 2013 ensuring food security and healthy nutrition for a rising world population and tackling environmental degradation deforestation loss of biodiversity and other environmental problems while adapting to and mitigating climate change are highly complex endeavors humankind relies on the insight obtained through scientific approaches for devising adequate countermeasures and ensuring high quality of life for future generations scenario development is one of the main scientific approaches applied to gain understanding of the manifold interrelations characterizing global agro food and land use systems and their contribution to climate change scenario studies usually comprise small numbers of individual scenarios that are based on specific storylines or socioeconomic framework conditions for example the shared socio economic pathways ssps o neill et al 2017 provide narratives for five qualitative descriptions of future changes in demographics economy policies lifestyle etc that serve the climate research community as a common reference for deriving individual scenarios although specific interpretations and model implementations vary see e g popp et al 2017 storyline based scenario development is characterized by modelers designing specific sets of parameter settings and exogenous framework conditions that are considered as consistent plausible and suitable for deriving a quantitative representation of a specific storyline or narrative although the purpose of scenario development is inherently different from forecasting or predicting storyline based scenarios could be argued to imply some degree of prognosis or at least tend to reflect expectations and world views of scenario developers cf gambhir et al 2019 schneider 1997 trutnevyte et al 2016 they are based on the assumption that certain developments are more or less likely under specific settings or framework conditions it is on the basis of this presumption that model developers derive storyline specific sets of input data e g linking globally converging diets to moderate population increases in ssp2 titled middle of the road and unhealthy meat rich diets to high population increases in ssp3 regional rivalry see o neill et al 2017 popp et al 2017 this approach is assumed to result in scenarios that are not only internally consistent but also plausible and representative for the underlying storylines while acknowledging that it is impossible to know beforehand how future trajectories of many important parameters will unfold apart from ssp based scenarios developed with integrated assessment models riahi et al 2017 rogelj et al 2018 the fao s alternative pathways to 2050 fao 2018 are a typical example for such storyline based scenario studies such storyline based scenarios are well suited for certain research questions and purposes and the influence of expert judgement on plausibility and likelihood of certain developments should certainly never be disregarded in scenario development and interpretation still it appears justified that scholars have argued for scenario developers to embrace a wide range of uncertainties morgan and keith 2008 trutnevyte et al 2016 and to expect the unexpected cf bennett et al 2003 p√©rez soba and maas 2015 although biobam is also suitable for storyline based scenario development see section 3 1 it is designed for a different yet complementary approach to exploring complex interrelations and the implications of specific development paths instead of deriving small numbers of scenarios that each represent a particular worldview and maybe complementing them with sensitivity analyses regarding selected parameters the option space approach does not single out specific pathways it acknowledges the inherent unknowability of future long term developments of crucial influencing factors shifts attention to a wider scope of conceivable futures and thus supports a comprehensive view on systemic relations and dependencies irrespective of what is considered as plausible or realistic it furthermore allows to put specific parameter combinations i e one individual scenario in context to assess the weight of individual parameters i e whether diets or yields have a larger impact on e g ghg emissions and to generally embrace the large uncertainty of the future development of the global agri food system while biobam is not designed for assessing economic effects or determining optimal pathways it emphasizes the basic idea of scenario analysis to approach research questions involving complex systems from a what if perspective aiming for a deeper understanding of systemic interaction an exceptional feature of the biobam algorithms is that they are entirely based on biophysical parameters while many socio economic regulatory and legislative issues are deliberately disregarded this implies that biobam is suitable for other research questions than agro economic models and should thus not be seen as competing but rather complementary to other established modelling approaches the diagnostic approach and specific algorithms of biobam imply limitations that must be considered in study designs as well as scenario interpretation in accordance with its aims biobam calculates neither economic equilibria nor cost optimal development paths scenarios obtained with biobam are internally consistent in terms of biomass production and consumption or otherwise labelled as infeasible but may appear as improbable or even outlandish under current economic framework conditions the ex post evaluation of biobam scenarios is a viable option to gain insight into possible economic implications respectively the likelihood of scenarios under economic criteria see r√∂√∂s et al 2020 it should also be noted that core model parameters such as crop yields are defined exogenously while they could be significantly influenced by feedback mechanisms not reflected in the model for example shortage of cropland may lead to rising land prices and thus create stronger incentives for breeding high yielding crops than in a situation with lower demand for cropland while it is technically feasible to implement such feedback mechanisms their implementation in biobam would imply considerable changes in the model architecture this may represent a significant limitation for certain research questions the diagnostic nature of biobam scenarios and option spaces implies challenges for communicating results as most researchers and stakeholders are used to different modelling philosophies and objectives such as identifying likely or cost optimal pathways another challenge for communicating the results is associated with the model s capacity to derive global scenarios with multiple layers of geographic units this feature should not seduce users to interpret results for individual regions without considering the wider spatial context and underlying assumptions the model applications presented in this paper serve as examples for the types of studies biobam is designed for they concern biophysical possibilities and limitations at various spatial scales investigate relationships between agricultural demand and environmental pressures and explore pathways in food and agricultural systems beyond the conventional the explorative approach to scenario analysis supported by biobam is thus also particularly useful in connection with participatory processes where it can assist stakeholders in thinking out of the box and considering unconventional scenarios and their possible implications the presented scenarios on the expansion of agro ecological innovations in the eu are an illustrative example providing insight into how the ghg emissions and other environmental pressures of the eu agriculture and land sector could be reduced significantly through afforestation the land sector could even become a strong net carbon sink if europeans cut food wastes by 50 and switch to healthy diets with significantly less consumption of animal products as assumed in the scenarios lfs and laesyst in these local production scenarios the livestock sector shrinks by 70 and total crop production can be reduced substantially without adverse effects on self sufficiency the results from the second exemplary application section 3 2 on global afforestation potentials for climate mitigation illustrate the basic idea of an option space approach albeit with a relatively small option space i e a small number of scenarios in comparison to previous studies e g erb et al 2016 theurl et al 2020b we find a range for annual co2 sequestration from afforestation that compares well with ranges from previous studies considering fao based diets and zero to medium energy crop demand the carbon sink in 2050 accounts for 0 5 4 4 gt co2 yr without and 3 3 8 6 gt co2 yr with grassland intensification see si results from previous studies range from 0 5 to 7 gt co2 yr fuss et al 2018 lenton 2014 the option space further illustrates that the different crop yield projections according to fao 2018 have relatively small influence on afforestation potentials whereas the area used for energy crop cultivation based on ranges found in literature human diets and intensity of grassland use are major influencing factors while it is often difficult to identify the reasons for broad ranges in literature the option space approach it suitable for putting them into perspective and discloses sensitivities to multidimensional uncertainties credit authorship contribution statement gerald kalt conceptualization methodology software

24550,close to 40 of earth s land area is used for agriculture to provide humankind with plant and animal based food fibers or bioenergy future trends in agricultural land use livestock husbandry and associated environmental pressures are determined by developments in the food sector agricultural productivity technology and many other influencing factors scenario analysis helps to understand their complex interaction and obtain quantitative insight we here present an in depth description of the agricultural land use model biobam ghg 2 0 biobam designed for evaluating large numbers of agricultural and livestock production scenarios assembled on the basis of exogenous assumptions on food systems crop yields and other factors biobam determines the feasibility of specific parameter combinations and the corresponding greenhouse gas ghg emissions from agricultural activities livestock husbandry land use change and other activities we provide a description of the software environment the model s data structures input and output variables and model algorithms to illustrate the model s capabilities and the scope of model applications we describe two exemplary studies performed with biobam we assess implications of agro ecological innovations and the feasibility of their widespread application in order to illustrate their implications in terms of agricultural self sufficiency and ghg emissions this first case study aligns a small number of individual scenarios with qualitative storylines we also showcase a biophysical option space approach which represents a comprehensive sensitivity analysis regarding the multidimensional uncertainties inherent to main influencing parameters i e projections for diets and yields assumptions on cropland use for bioenergy and regarding grassland intensification the global potential of forest regeneration for climate change mitigation serves as an example for this second approach the option space comprises 90 scenarios and encompasses the full range of literature estimates on ghg mitigation from afforestation in 2050 0 5 7 gt co2 yr it further shows that the potential is zero under certain diet yield combinations assuming zero energy crop cultivation and global convergence to a healthy reference diet the sequestration potential of afforestation rises to 10 gt co2 yr in 2050 these exemplary applications illustrate how option spaces developed with biobam can complement scenario based assessments that usually focus on small numbers of individual scenarios option spaces shift attention to a wider scope of conceivable futures and thus support a comprehensive view on systemic relations and dependencies whereas analyses with few scenarios allow apprehension of much more detailed scenario narratives and qualifications keywords agriculture land use modelling food system integrated assessment model climate change afforestation 1 introduction 1 1 purpose and scope of agricultural land use modelling over the last 300 years global agricultural land has expanded fivefold ramankutty et al 2018 and today accounts for close to 40 of earth s land area fao 2021 agriculture has been the main cause for deforestation garcia et al 2020 kissinger et al 2012 williams 2006 and has also become a major contributor to environmental degradation springmann et al 2018 steinfeld et al 2006 tilman 1999 willett et al 2019 and climate change causing about one fifth of today s annual anthropogenic greenhouse gas ghg emissions arneth et al 2019 vermeulen et al 2012 wri 2021 in scientific research on the prospective development and impacts of agriculture scenario analysis has emerged as the major method to understand complex interactions between food systems agricultural production and environmental pressures at various scales see e g audsley et al 2006 fao 2018 poux and aubert 2018 st√ºrck et al 2018 wolf et al 2015 different modelling techniques are used for deriving scenarios including empirical statistical process or agent based approaches lambin et al 2000 economic optimization and equilibrium models are most widely applied in the scientific literature prominent examples for economic models include the gaps model global agriculture perspectives system kavallari et al 2016 used for deriving the scenarios of the food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao 2018 and the capri model common agricultural policy regionalised impact analysis model britz and witzke 2014 developed for assessing domestic and global effects of the european union s common agricultural policy e g britz and hertel 2011 pelikan et al 2015 wolf et al 2015 other important models include image rose et al 2011 stehfest et al 2009 globiom havlik et al 2018 2013 valin et al 2013 and magpie dietrich et al 2020 lotze campen et al 2010 which are parts of larger modelling frameworks called integrated assessment models iams and the impact model of the international food policy research institute robinson et al 2015 fig 1 illustrates the scope and purpose of the agricultural land use models as understood in the present context based on exogenous drivers like dietary changes population or economic development the demand for agricultural commodities comprising crops and agricultural products like meat or vegetable oil is determined demand side future developments of the relevant drivers are often adopted from authoritative studies or diverse pathways reflecting different expectations or world views are contrasted against each other as in the case of the shared socio economic pathways ssps see o neill et al 2017 roe et al 2019 the production side on the other hand is modelled on the basis of parameters like land cover crop yields agricultural practices e g conventional organic farming etc established models like globiom and magpie feature spatially explicit representations of land and are capable of modelling land use change based on economic considerations a core characteristic of such agricultural land use models is how a balance between demand and supply is established in economic partial equilibrium models like the abovementioned this is achieved through endogenous adjustments in market prices that ultimately lead to equality between supply and demand for each product havlik et al 2018 economic parameters like regionally diverse production costs and demand elasticity s influence the quantities and location of agricultural production and consumption usually assessing the impacts of agricultural production e g greenhouse gas ghg emissions land use change or derived parameters such as water consumption for irrigation represent the core aims of scenario development further scenario specific implications such as trade patterns changes in regional self sufficiencies are a direct outcome of the demand supply balancing algorithms biobam abbreviated for biomass balance model was designed as a biophysical accounting model that calculates the balance between biomass supply and biomass demand erb et al 2009a it follows a diagnostic approach erb et al 2016 based on exogenous trajectories for demand i e fixed demand as opposed to price elastic demand usually implemented in economic models and scenario specific restrictions on or limitations to land use change such restrictions include regulatory aspects e g protected areas and biophysical framework conditions e g suitability of grazing areas for crop production and can further reflect specific research questions e g which projections for diets are feasible in a world without further expansion of cropland areas the original focus of biobam was on determining the feasibility of various dietary projections with future land use and production patterns according to scenarios from authoritative institutions especially the food and agriculture organization of the united nations see fao 2018 the feasibility was determined by a mass balance approach 1 2 development history and design principles of biobam the original version of biobam biobam 1 0 erb et al 2009 was based on three consistent and spatially explicit databases for the year 2000 on land use erb et al 2007 biomass flows from harvest to use krausmann et al 2008 and human appropriation of net primary production haberl et al 2007a it was used amongst others to assess global biomass potentials for bioenergy erb et al 2012 haberl et al 2011 2010 and future option spaces for food and agriculture erb et al 2016 by combining various projections for crop variants yields livestock efficiencies human diets etc under different limitations for cropland expansion and grazing intensity it was used to calculate global biomass supply demand balances for 500 scenarios of the global agro food system in 2050 erb et al 2016 the results were combined to a biophysical option space of feasible futures in which demand for cropland products matches supply by at least 95 considering a 5 uncertainty range and grazing intensities on grassland the ratio of grazed or mowed biomass to actually prevailing net primary productivity stay below ecological thresholds biobam 1 0 was entirely implemented in microsoft excel had rigid data structures comprising for example 11 world regions and 14 biomass demand categories see e g erb et al 2016 and accounted for a limited number of environmental pressures such as land use intensity and total biomass appropriation but not for key pressures and impacts such as ghg emissions biobam 1 0 produced snapshot i e single year scenarios and was designed to explore a broad range of conceivable futures regardless of what is considered likely or desirable from the present perspective agricultural land was not allowed to encroach into forests zero deforestation assumption and trade quantities between world regions was computed solely on the basis of biophysical parameters and resulting supply and demand relations in biobam 1 0 trade was not influenced by historical trade patterns a core difference to economic models with similar scope as well as the sustainability and organic livestock model solm m√ºller et al 2020 that has been maintained to the current version of biobam biobam was subsequently expanded to include greenhouse gas ghg emissions from agricultural production livestock husbandry and land use change luc building on the option space developed in erb et al 2016 the extended model biobam ghg is suitable for feasibility assessments of global food system scenarios complemented with ghg balances a study performed with biobam ghg theurl et al 2020b shows that human and livestock diets are the main determinant of ghg emissions with highest ghg emissions found for scenarios including high meat demand especially if focused on ruminant meat and milk whereas gains in crop yields are of minor significance another application of biobam ghg is presented in kalt et al 2020 an assessment of global agricultural bioenergy potentials based on latest crop yield and diet scenarios issued by fao 2018 by applying biobam ghg systemic ghg effects of providing agricultural biomass for energy which are often overlooked in bioenergy potential assessments haberl 2013 are quantified we here report on further developments towards biobam ghg 2 0 these were motivated by three core aims first to provide flexibility in terms of geographical resolution i e being able to develop scenarios on various scales ranging from world regional to sub national level timeframes and milestone years i e calculating scenario results for intermediate years not just one specific target year as in biobam 1 0 and data structures such as the number and aggregates of considered crops and agricultural products and their conversion processes e g feed conversion rates of agricultural animal products fcrs second to support variations in model algorithms reflecting different rationales of scenario development or addressing specific research questions e g unimpeded global trade vs self sufficiency ambitions in specific regions maintaining current regional production patterns of animal products vs re distribution based on for example biophysical potentials for ruminant grazing and third to implement the model in an adequate and efficient software environment that enables the calculation of large numbers of scenarios with high regional resolution while maintaining easy to use input data handling and scenario management via standardized ms excel worksheets biobam ghg 2 0 represents the successful implementation of these aims this paper provides a description of the software environment its data structures input and output variables and model algorithms methods section to illustrate the scope of possible research questions we further describe two exemplary model applications discuss technical aspects of the respective approaches and present selected scenario results results section a discussion and conclusions section concludes the main article comprehensive descriptions of input and output parameters as well as mathematical model descriptions are provided in the supplementary information si to this article 2 methods 2 1 concepts of scenario development for illustrating the basic concepts of scenario development supported by biobam we assume various exogenous data for 3 input parameters a b and c fig 2 the input data are generally differentiated by region and are time dependant i e represented by individual time series for each region for example parameter a may represent population development b diets and c projections for crop yields three variants are assumed for each input parameter in fig 2 the most common scenario approach in scientific literature is to develop a small number of individual scenarios case a where only certain combinations of parameter settings are considered in contrast the option space approach biobam is designed for case b is characterized by combining all available parameter settings leading to large numbers of scenarios because every particular combination of assumptions on all input parameters defines one scenario the analysis of an option space can focus on the feasibility of the various scenarios as in erb et al 2016 or certain quantitative results such as total or disaggregated greenhouse gas emissions as dependent on variations of specific input parameters as in theurl et al 2020 whereas the interpretation of single scenarios is usually not in focus of such studies for some parameters only certain combinations of parameter settings are possible for example changes in livestock systems may imply different feed compositions as well as changes in manure management in such situations changes in feed composition and manure management parameters e g emission factors need to be coupled resulting in a reduced option space where only certain parameter combinations of b and c are considered see case c in fig 2 in this sense case a which is characterized by few individual scenarios with certain parameter combinations can be understood as a special case of an option space where only coupled parameter settings occur although biobam is designed for large numbers of scenarios up to several hundred scenarios being calculated in parallel it supports parameter coupling for all dynamic input data and can also be applied for calculating individual scenarios see section 3 2 2 software environment and data handling the version of biobam presented here biobam ghg 2 0 was implemented in mathworks matlab version r2018a format with data export from and import to ms excel realized with vba macros input data see fig 3 include model run settings structural settings regional units commodity definitions and their characteristics etc biophysical data like areas and crop yields and various parameters for calculating impacts primarily ghg emissions the matlab code is structured into three phases 1 initialization including data import data validity and completeness checks interpolation etc 2 main model algorithm calculating scenario results and 3 post processing preparation of export tables export to csv files exported data tables are arranged in a way suitable for pivot tables in order to allow efficient and flexible data handling in ms excel fig 3 provides further information on the respective sub routines complete lists of input and results variables are provided in the si 2 3 data structures 2 3 1 space biobam supports three layers of geographical units layer 1 3 in the present default dataset these layers are sub national administrative divisions nuts1 2 regions in the eu layer 3 countries and world regions for non eu countries currently no sub national level data are available thus the sub national and the country layer layer 2 are identical the main model algorithms are performed on the highest geographic detail level units on this level are referred to as regions regardless of whether they correspond to sub national divisions as is the case for the eu or countries all non eu countries and the structure of geographic layers as region structure the main advantage of geographic layers is simplified input and output data handling most input data can be specified on either layer in order to be inherited to the respective sub units in the course of data pre processing for example human diets are usually provided on country level or data on manure management systems on world regional level layer 1 due to the absence of more detailed information if needed however the model is capable of implementing specific data on layer 2 or 3 certain input data such as agricultural areas or population must be provided on regional level since they are defining characteristics of each region see si for a full list of input parameters and their characteristics similarly model results can be displayed for each element at all layers further regional groupings that are entirely independent from the layered region structure are trade clusters and groups of regions for results evaluation trade clusters are groups of regions that maintain intensive trade relations e g all nuts2 regions within the eu the definition of trade clusters which is flexible and can be amended in concordance with particular research questions influences production patterns and in effect regional trade balances for crops and agricultural products see section 2 4 depending on the research question and scenario design trade clusters may be identical to layers but can basically be defined as any aggregate of layer 3 units trade within clusters is prioritized over imports from or exports to regions outside of the respective cluster to emulate trade relationships at different levels two layers of trade clusters may be defined e g all sub national regions of country as first layer and international free trade areas as second layer model results sometimes need to be interpreted for regional groupings that do not correspond to the regional layers e g country groups representing northern southern eastern and western europe as in r√∂√∂s et al 2020 to make results readily available for any such groupings in the results sheets especially ratio values or indicators that cannot be simply aggregated like self sufficiency or land use intensity it is possible to designate regional groupings for results evaluation 2 3 2 time all calculations in biobam are performed on annual level the timeframe is defined in the model settings by specifying a base year a final year and optional intermediate years for example in the first application presented in section 3 1 we considered one intermediate year 2030 between the base year 2012 and the final year 2050 final and intermediate years are referred to as scenario years all considered years as milestone years all model outputs are calculated for each milestone year all exogenous input data must be provided for the base year for the sake of convenience in input data handling data input for intermediate years and the final year is optional and missing values are filled during the initialization routine based on inter extrapolation rules if no scenario data are provided for a certain input parameter base year data are assumed to remain constant if input data are provided for at least two milestone years the missing data are obtained through interpolation 2 3 3 commodities with regard to crops biobam differentiates between crop types and crop groups for example crop types are cultivar species like wheat and maize which are grouped to the crop group cereals parameters like yields nitrogen contents or residue to crop ratios are defined on the level of crop types for diets feed conversion rates fcrs etc crop groups are used this allows for flexibility in diets fcrs depending on which crop types are available within the region or as imports the composition of crop groups used as food or feed may vary this approach aligns well with the level of detail used in typical reference diets in literature reference diets are usually composed of categories like cereals or roots and do not specify crop species despite differences in nutrient contents between crops types in such broad groups the full list of crop types and crop groups implemented in the most recent version of the model is provided in the si besides crops agricultural commodities represented in biobam include grass crop residues straw stover etc and agricultural products grass is produced on permanent and temporary grassland grazing areas and on temporary cropland i e fodder leys and is just like crop residues an optional component of livestock diets primarily of ruminants crop residues are characterized by crop specific parameters residue to crop ratios nitrogen contents and suitability as animal feed agricultural products are secondary commodities like meat and milk they primarily include animal products but other commodities like liquid biofuels may also be modelled as agricultural products a common feature of all agricultural products is that they are produced from primary commodities crops residues and or grass and thus characterized by exogenously defined primary commodity to product conversion factors livestock production is thus modelled as processes converting feed to specific products cf bouwman et al 2005 herrero et al 2013 wirsenius 2003 the conversion factors are in this context referred to as feed conversion ratios fcrs and correspond to exogenous defined livestock diets 2 4 model algorithms the following sections explain the algorithms for matching crop supply with demand section 2 4 1 for modelling land use change 2 4 2 and for determining regional production patterns of agricultural products like meat or milk 2 4 3 the calculation of ghg emissions is largely based on ipcc default methods and thus not explained in detail here see si for mathematical descriptions and specific data sources n2o emissions are addressed briefly in connection with the methods regarding nitrogen cycles section 2 4 4 the demand for agricultural commodities is determined by parameters such as population diets and fcrs which are dynamic and region specific exogenous input data due to regional variations in production side parameters e g yields fcrs the regional distribution of production has an influence on total land requirements and resulting parameters like land conversion the model algorithms for determining the regional distribution of agricultural production are thus central to all model outcomes they are explained in the subsequent sub sections 2 4 1 matching crop supply with demand in biobam the algorithms for determining production quantities and their regional distribution are exclusively based on biophysical parameters such as agricultural areas yields fcrs area expansion allowances etc these are external input data obtained from statistical databases spatial explicit information projections from authoritative studies or self derived scenario specific assumptions see table s1 in the si 1 1 this is a major difference to partial equilibrium models where crop supply and demand are brought into equilibrium by mimicking market mechanisms the regional distribution of crop production in such models is determined by economic parameters i e production costs linked to site specific conditions such as crop yields and labor costs optimization algorithms ensure that supply meets demand at the lowest possible overall costs while respecting model and or scenario specific constraints e g maximum or minimum allowed area shares for each crop type boundaries to self sufficiencies maximum change rates see dietrich et al 2020 havlik et al 2018 with crop demand being determined by exogenous data and run settings distribution approaches crop production is adjusted to demand situations by straightforward calculation steps based on regional production potentials i e available cropland and regionally diverse yields to be able to replicate future production patterns according to scenarios from authoritative institutions e g fao 2018 biobam supports the definition of initial ex ante production patterns implemented as exogenous cropland areas per region and crop ex ante cropland allocation serves as initial situation for adjusting production to demand in scenario years fig 4 shows a schematic illustration of the interrelations between exogenous input data and parameters calculated within the model the calculations are performed for each region individually supply side calculations left part of fig 4 are performed on the level of crop types and aggregated to crop groups demand side calculations right part are entirely on crop group level as diets and fcrs are defined on the basis of crop groups the ex ante crop group balance the difference between ex ante supply and demand relevant on regional and global level is a main parameter for the subsequent supply demand matching algorithm ex ante cropland allocation may be omitted altogether it depends on the scenario design and the underlying narratives whether ex ante allocation is indicated for example for a business as usual scenario where significant changes in production and trade patterns are considered unlikely choosing constant ex ante crop shares in each region makes sense in contrast a research question that depends on considering reduced international trade flows and more regional self sufficiency can better be addressed without ex ante allocation as this results in stronger influence of regional demand on production patterns see scenarios in section 3 1 having determined the ex ante crop group balance for each layer 3 region the supply demand matching algorithm is executed it attempts to bring supply and demand into equilibrium by simply adjusting crop production quantities within the limits of biophysical feasibility and cropland expansion allowances exogenous data the individual steps of the algorithm that is performed for each milestone year and each scenario in parallel using multi dimensional matrices are explained in table 1 model run settings determine whether individual steps of the balancing algorithms are executed or not thereby influencing crop production patterns for example preference for supply from within the region or within trade clusters can be deactivated resulting in the steps 2 or 3 and 4 respectively to be skipped the program then proceeds directly to the next higher spatial level at each spatial level crop deficits are reduced as far as possible by allocating area to the production of crops that are in deficit this allocation is performed in a way that does not prioritize certain crop groups over others if insufficient cropland is available to cover the deficits of all crop groups at a certain spatial level the allocation algorithm ensures that all deficits are reduced in equal shares finally step 6 the allocation of crop groups to cropland in each region is definite if crop deficits remain the scenario is found to be infeasible 2 4 2 land use land use change and carbon stocks the following land use categories are represented in the model cultivated cropland fallow cropland grazing land broken down by grassland classes of different productivity and grazing suitability see erb et al 2016 and regenerated vegetation forest shrub land etc and unproductive areas settlements infrastructure on areas formerly used as agricultural land the representation of land in the base year is limited to cropland and grazing land as deforestation for agricultural land expansion has so far been disregarded in model applications zero deforestation assumption see erb et al 2016 land use in the base year is exogenous and based on statistical databases and maps e g erb et al 2007 eurostat 2021 fao 2021 2018 land use change in scenario years is determined by agricultural demand land characteristics e g suitability of grazing land as cropland and scenario specific assumptions such as maximum allowed cropland expansion table 2 summarizes the relevant types of land use change and their effects on carbon c stocks the calculation of c stock is based on the components biomass litter and soil and largely consistent with ipcc methods and default parameters e g soil and litter c stocks are assumed to require 20 years until they are in a new equilibrium state annual amount of co2 emissions or removals resulting from this c stock change extending over a twenty year period is in accordance with ipcc tier 1 principles assumed constant the currently implemented regional parameters are based on ipcc climate zones ecosystem zones and soil maps see ipcc 2006 batjes 2010 fao 2012 and thus reflect regional variation in temperature precipitation and soil types see si for a detailed explanation unproductive areas are only considered to reflect loss of agricultural land to built up area infrastructure etc vegetation regrowth is basically assumed to occur naturally if agricultural land is permanently left idle on cropland vegetation regrowth usually corresponds to forest regrowth due to the climatic conditions on most of the world s cropland areas but may also represent conversion to shrub land or other vegetation types with relatively low c stock the regionally specific c accumulation curves are supplied to the model as exogenous time series on annual level see si in comparison to the comprehensive statistics on global cropland use and productivity data on grassland productivity and utilization are sparse even for regions with good agricultural statistics such as the eu in biobam roughage supply potentials from grassland are calculated from regional specific net primary productivity npp data and maximum sustainable grazing intensities defined as the ratio of grazing harvest to actual productivity see erb et al 2016 fetzel et al 2017 kalt et al 2020 petz et al 2014 grazing intensities gi characterize the intensity of grassland use and vary from zero to the maximum sustainable value gimax to account for different grassland qualities i e variability in npp and maximum grazing intensities within regions grassland is split into quality classes each class is characterized by its area and regional specific npp and gimax values differences in nutritional values of grass grass qualities cf van hal et al 2019 are accounted for by converting dry matter quantities to equivalents of high quality grass grassland use in the base year is defined by data from livestock statistics and empirical data on fcrs i e by calculating the grass intake of livestock under consideration of feed intake from cropland sources grazing intensities are thus derived from consumption quantities and the available grazing land we assume that grass supply from the different classes is proportional to their respective production potentials taking palatability and accessibility constraints into account fetzel et al 2017 haberl et al 2007a for scenario years the default assumption is that the grazing intensity continues to be determined by the demand changes in grazing intensities over time cause c stock changes two optional algorithms have been implemented to develop different scenarios regarding grassland use a to simulate grassland abandonment in case of decreasing demand it can be assumed that gi may not decrease below the base year value if this were to happen parts of the grassland area are abandoned see table 2 b the optional setting universal grazing intensification results in grass supply being concentrated to the most productive areas thereby freeing up less productive grassland for vegetation regrowth usually forest regeneration see section 3 2 technically this is achieved by setting the gi of all grassland classes to gimax and reducing the area to the minimum extent required to supply the grass demand areas of low productivity grassland classes are reduced first highly productive grazing areas last depending on exogenous scenario assumptions on diets fcrs loss of agricultural land etc as well as the regional distribution approach applied for animal products see next section the gi required to supply the demand in a certain region may exceed the maximum sustainable threshold gimax by default it is assumed that grass is not traded between regions in this case the result is a regional grazing infeasibility the occurrence of regional grazing infeasibilities indicates that the mass balances in this scenario are not closed however this does not necessarily mean that the scenario or model run is useless as long as this partial inconsistency between supply and demand is taken into account in the interpretation regional infeasibilities sometimes provide valuable insight e g for determining regions where it is impossible to maintain current livestock production quantities if the use of concentrate feed is phased out see theurl et al 2020a 2 4 3 agricultural product distribution regional production patterns of animal production and other secondary commodities are not necessarily linked to regional resource availability naylor et al 2005 livestock husbandry particularly in intensive systems is often largely based on concentrate feeds from other regions countries and continents social economic and other influencing parameters on regional production patterns see e g robinson et al 2014 steinfeld et al 2006 are beyond the scope of the model thus we developed different approaches for deriving regional production patterns for agricultural products that are suitable for different contexts or research questions table 3 provides an overview and brief explanations for these approaches the respective algorithms distribute the global demand corresponding to the global target production amongst all geographic regions they are thus referred to as distribution approaches 2 4 4 nitrogen cycle and n2o emissions nitrogen cycles are a relatively complex aspect of the model that have a considerable impact on ghg emissions via various mechanisms a simplified illustration of the related calculation routines which are performed for each region individually is provided in fig 5 calculations related to nitrogen cycles on cropland are located in the left part of the figure those related to the livestock sector in the right part nitrogen removals from cropland comprise harvested crops and crop residues permanently removed from the field mainly residues used as feed straw used for livestock bedding is assumed to be returned to the field nitrogen inflows include livestock manure available for field application atmospheric deposition biological nitrogen fixation and synthetic fertilizer application for the base year synthetic fertilizer use is available from fao statistics together with the other inflows and removals calculated within the model this exogenous data is used to derive regionally specific nitrogen use efficiencies nues cf eu nitrogen expert panel 2016 lassaletta et al 2014 nues are by default assumed to remain constant in each region hence for scenario years nues are known parameters and can be used for deriving future synthetic fertilizer requirements assumptions on future nue developments can also be implemented via regionally specific exogenous change factors it is thus assumed that synthetic fertilizer is applied for balancing the gap between the required amount of nitrogen and organic nitrogen sources this practice however is only feasible in conventional agriculture whereas in organic farming the use of synthetic fertilizer is prohibited dabbert et al 2004 ma and joachim 2006 sanders 2013 to be able to consider this limitation and investigate its relevance in scenarios with high shares of organic farming see section 3 2 a separate nitrogen balance is calculated for areas under organic farming biological fixation of catch crops and under sown crops is considered as additional nitrogen source on organic farming areas the model determines whether a closed nitrogen balance is possible and calculates the size of an eventual nitrogen deficit for each region nitrogen inputs to cropland in the form of synthetic fertilizers residues and manure determine soil n2o emissions the corresponding algorithms and default emission factors are derived from ipcc guidelines ipcc 2019 mathematical descriptions for nitrogen related algorithms and emissions are provided in the si 2 4 5 further model features and validation of base year results apart from the abovementioned co2 emissions from carbon stock changes and n2o emissions from manure management and managed soils the following ghg sources are considered in biobam methane emissions from enteric fermentation in livestock manure management and rice cultivation nitrous oxide emissions from residue burning and ghg emissions from field operations and synthetic fertilizer production upstream emissions further model outputs that are useful for characterizing scenario developments include self sufficiency indicators calculated for all geographic entities of interest layers 1 3 and further regional groupings defined for this specific purpose apart from self sufficiencies with individual crops and agricultural products total crops and total harvested biomass potential self sufficiencies are provided for each milestone year calculated as the ratio of available agricultural area to the area required for supplying the intra regional demand it gives insight into the attainable degree of self sufficiency irrespective of the specific production patterns emerging in the considered scenario as a simplified indicator for human appropriation of net primary productivity hanpp see erb et al 2009 haberl et al 2013 2007b biobam further calculates the ratio of total biomass harvest in each spatial entity relative to the total potential net primary productivity on the used agricultural area exogenous data this indicator is suitable as a proxy for assessing trends in biodiversity pressures see haberl et al 2005 mayer et al 2021a vaƒçk√°≈ô et al 2016 a comparison of ghg emission results from biobam for the base year 2012 with datasets in literature e g crippa et al 2019 fao 2020 herrero et al 2013 performed as a means of model validation yields the following insight differences amongst literature data are often considerable mainly due to different methods and sometimes inconsistent data bases mainly in the global south on world regional level biobam results for the most relevant ghg emission categories enteric fermentation and manure management are mostly within the ranges of literature data for regions with high data quality such as europe or north america the different calculations methods applied in biobam based on livestock feed intake see si and faostat based on livestock heads see tubiello et al 2015 produce very similar results larger differences are found for regions like sub saharan africa or south eastern asia where data uncertainties are generally higher and different methods exacerbate data inconsistencies a comprehensive comparison of biobam results with literature data on world region level is provided in the si section 3 1 3 exemplary model applications we present two exemplary model applications to demonstrate how biobam is used to investigate concrete research questions the first application is an individual scenario approach with one business as usual scenario and four scenarios characterized by an expansion of agro ecological practices in the eu the second one an option space approach investigating global potentials for forest regeneration as climate mitigation measure under different food system pathways the following sections provide brief descriptions of these exemplary model applications the complete scenario results are available from zenodo data repositories kalt et al 2021 mayer et al 2021b 3 1 scenarios for agro ecological practices in the eu in the research project uniseco schwarz 2020 biobam is applied for developing quantitative scenarios to storylines about expansion of agro ecological farming practices the storylines developed as part of a co creation process with stakeholders primarily differ with regard to two dimensions 1 the level of implementation of agro ecological practices and 2 the localisation of the food system i e the evolution of international trade within the eu and globally the full storylines their rationale and the process of developing them are described in r√∂√∂s et al 2020 and the purpose to bring them into this paper is purely to illustrate how biobam can be used to model biophysical results of such narratives thus this section gives only a brief overview of the storylines and how they have been implemented in the model this includes variations in model algorithms e g agricultural product distribution approaches trade cluster settings as well as in input data table 4 although the scope of the performed model runs is global the focus of this scenario analysis is on the eu and thus selected results are presented for the eu broken down by countries the business as usual bau storyline describes a future in which globalization of the eu food system and the specialization of farming systems and regions continues this is implemented by projecting base year characteristics into the future ex ante crop shares as well as the production distribution of agricultural product in 2050 correspond to those in 2012 the eu is defined as one trade cluster within a global food system diets are not substantially changed but follow current trends bau scenario according to fao 2018 and there are no changes in fcrs the second storyline titled agro ecology for exports aeexp assumes a future where humanity counts on technological progress to achieve sustainable development agro ecological practices are a means to produce high value foods for trade between eu member states but also for exports to newly affluent foreign economies the technical implementation is similar to the previous one and includes a fixed distribution of animal products production amongst world regions in contrast to the implementation of bau production patterns within the eu are allowed to shift regionally this is necessary to facilitate a second characteristic of the storyline implementation agro ecological ruminant husbandry is achieved through substituting concentrate feed with grass thus production is required to shift towards regions with high grassland potentials further characteristics include improved fcrs of monogastrics and corresponding to the narrative of the aeexp storyline higher cropland expansion allowance up to 70 in nuts2 regions with sufficient suitable land available for conversion to cropland high cropland expansion allowance is also a feature of the third storyline called localization for protectionism lfp set in a future with increasing rivalry between nations nationalism and regional conflicts it is characterized by individual countries aiming for reduced dependence on imports current regional patterns are thus broken up and agricultural production is primarily determined by national demand core aspects of the technical implementation are an omitted ex ante allocation of cropland i e crop production is first of all determined by national demand and demand based production of animal production within each individual country these settings reflecting societies that favour local national production over imports are also applied for the last two storylines called localization for sustainability lfs and local agro ecological food system laesyst however in these scenarios the driving force behind local food systems is the ambitious pursuit of sustainability goals this is further reflected in more sustainable diets and reduced food wastes laesyst features a high 50 share of organic or ae farming another characteristic of laesyst is that pressure on cropland is reduced by substituting ruminant for monogastric animal products and a shift to largely grass based ruminant diets selected scenario results are presented on country level in fig 6 in the bau scenario the production of crops and animal products in the eu increase significantly in practically all countries facilitated by crop yield improvements and cropland expansion this is a consequence from rising global demand caused by population dynamics as well as changes in diets the self sufficiency with crops as well as agricultural greenhouse gas emissions rise in most countries in eleven countries by more than 50 2 2 note that the shares of manure management systems are assumed to remain constant and technical measures for reducing ghg emissions in livestock systems are disregarded the aeexp scenario shows comparatively moderate changes in crop production quantities mainly due to a shift from concentrate feed to grass hence the demand for feed crops within europe declines significantly but is compensated partly by additional production for direct human nutrition to facilitate largely grass based ruminant livestock systems livestock breeding is transferred to regions with large underused grazing potentials such as spain portugal or the baltics fig 6b changes in crop self sufficiencies are similar to those in bau the total ghg emissions in the eu dominated by ch4 emissions from enteric fermentation show only minor changes as compared to 2012 due to major changes in the distribution of livestock production ghg emissions in spain portugal greece austria and croatia rise significantly by a factor of two to three whereas other countries like belgium netherlands france germany denmark and sweden experience considerable reductions by 48 to 95 in the three local production scenarios lfp lfs laesyst imports and exports are cut significantly especially those of animal products if human diets follow a business as usual trajectory lfp re orientation on local food systems implies a slight reduction in the total production of animal products crop production and ghg emissions from livestock production and agricultural activities remain relatively constant in most countries however a reduction in ruminant livestock and efficiency gains in fcrs result in large grassland areas being abandoned the resulting vegetation regrowth creates a considerable carbon sink that offsets much of the agricultural emissions total ghg emissions including carbon stock effects thus decline to 23 of the level in 2012 the agriculture and land sector can even become a strong net carbon sink if europeans cut food wastes by 50 and switch to healthy diets with significantly less consumption of animal products as assumed in lfs and laesyst in these local production scenarios the livestock sector shrinks by 70 leading to a considerable decrease in feed crop demand downsizing crop production is thus possible without reducing the crop self sufficiency within the eu in laesyst crop demand is further reduced by favouring ruminant products from grassland based livestock systems over cropland based animal products this reduces pressure on cropland and opens additional space for agro ecological practices but also results in higher ghg emissions than in lfs 3 2 forest regeneration for climate change mitigation forest regeneration on agricultural areas or afforestation has recently raised considerable attention as a natural climate solution in scientific literature bastin et al 2019 doelman et al 2019 fuss et al 2018 griscom et al 2017 humpen√∂der et al 2014 kreidenweis et al 2016 lenton 2014 although results on its global ghg mitigation potential differ widely from 0 5 to 7 gt co2 yr in 2050 fuss et al 2018 lenton 2014 forest regeneration is widely regarded as a promising long term option for sequestering co2 from the atmosphere however previous assessments did not investigate the relevance of main influencing parameters on the size of areas available for afforestation e g human diets crop yields in a systematic way moreover the latest yield and diet projections according to fao 2018 have so far not been considered in such assessments we here present an option space application of biobam which is based on these fao projections allowing to assess the influence of these influencing factors on future afforestation potentials further option space dimensions include the demand for energy crops which is expected to grow considerably and thus create a significant additional demand for cropland in many climate stabilization scenarios see roe et al 2019 and grassland intensification three variants of energy crop demand development are assumed zero demand medium demand 283 million hectare mha cropland in 2050 is based on the ssp2 scenario and high demand 724 mha in 2050 on the ssp5 scenario according to rogelj et al 2018 besides diet projections from fao 2018 we consider scenarios with global convergence to the healthy and sustainable eat lancet reference diet willett et al 2019 and to a healthy vegan diet according to usda and hhs 2010 the grassland variants are no intensification default assumption see section 2 4 2 and universal intensification where grazing intensities are increased to the maximum sustainable value to make land available for afforestation all scenarios are based on a medium projection for population development according to ssp2 see fricko et al 2017 3 3 various projections for population development according to ssp1 2 and 5 were considered for the option space but finally omitted due to their minor influence in comparison to other parameters while fuss et al 2018 quantify mitigation potentials in literature with annual values referring to 2050 we here focus on cumulative amounts from 2012 to 2050 the corresponding annual values are provided in the si fig 7 a shows cumulative co2 sequestration due to afforestation for all 90 scenarios and panel b the total cumulative luc emissions sequestration the co2 sequestration due to afforestation ranges from 0 in scenarios based on the stratified societies scenario sss fao 2018 and high energy crop demand to about 650 gt co2 equivalent gt co2e in a scenario with vegan diets crop yields according to the towards sustainability scenario tss universal grassland intensification and zero energy crop demand in scenarios with fao based diets up to 334 gt co2e are sequestered until 2050 if grassland use is intensified globally without intensification on grassland the upper limit is reduced to 101 gt co2e hence grassland intensification represents a key lever for unlocking the carbon mitigation potential of afforestation in scenarios with high energy crop demand the afforestation potential is reduced significantly to a maximum of 16 gt co2e without and 130 gt co2e with grassland intensification assuming fao based diets this result highlights the trade off between afforestation and large scale bioenergy deployment fig 7b shows the total cumulative co2 emissions sequestration from luc besides c stock changes from afforestation they also include the effects of grassland conversion to cropland changes in grazing intensities and shifts in cultivated crops e g towards perennial tree crops like fruits and nuts see table 2 in most fao diet scenarios without grassland intensification the co2 benefits from afforestation are more than compensated by these other land use changes however under the condition of universal grassland intensification the land sector becomes a net c sink in most scenarios although grassland intensification also results in c stock losses on grassland its net effect is clearly favourable in fao diet scenarios with medium energy crop demand the cumulative co2 emissions until 2050 amounts to 77 203 gt co2e the option space further illustrates that global convergence to healthy or vegan diets would increase the afforestation potential significantly under these assumptions the land sector could supply a high energy crop demand and still become a net carbon sink during 2012 2050 4 discussion and conclusions many of the most difficult and pressing global sustainability challenges cf o neill et al 2018 rockstr√∂m et al 2009 are strongly related to agriculture √∂born et al 2013 ensuring food security and healthy nutrition for a rising world population and tackling environmental degradation deforestation loss of biodiversity and other environmental problems while adapting to and mitigating climate change are highly complex endeavors humankind relies on the insight obtained through scientific approaches for devising adequate countermeasures and ensuring high quality of life for future generations scenario development is one of the main scientific approaches applied to gain understanding of the manifold interrelations characterizing global agro food and land use systems and their contribution to climate change scenario studies usually comprise small numbers of individual scenarios that are based on specific storylines or socioeconomic framework conditions for example the shared socio economic pathways ssps o neill et al 2017 provide narratives for five qualitative descriptions of future changes in demographics economy policies lifestyle etc that serve the climate research community as a common reference for deriving individual scenarios although specific interpretations and model implementations vary see e g popp et al 2017 storyline based scenario development is characterized by modelers designing specific sets of parameter settings and exogenous framework conditions that are considered as consistent plausible and suitable for deriving a quantitative representation of a specific storyline or narrative although the purpose of scenario development is inherently different from forecasting or predicting storyline based scenarios could be argued to imply some degree of prognosis or at least tend to reflect expectations and world views of scenario developers cf gambhir et al 2019 schneider 1997 trutnevyte et al 2016 they are based on the assumption that certain developments are more or less likely under specific settings or framework conditions it is on the basis of this presumption that model developers derive storyline specific sets of input data e g linking globally converging diets to moderate population increases in ssp2 titled middle of the road and unhealthy meat rich diets to high population increases in ssp3 regional rivalry see o neill et al 2017 popp et al 2017 this approach is assumed to result in scenarios that are not only internally consistent but also plausible and representative for the underlying storylines while acknowledging that it is impossible to know beforehand how future trajectories of many important parameters will unfold apart from ssp based scenarios developed with integrated assessment models riahi et al 2017 rogelj et al 2018 the fao s alternative pathways to 2050 fao 2018 are a typical example for such storyline based scenario studies such storyline based scenarios are well suited for certain research questions and purposes and the influence of expert judgement on plausibility and likelihood of certain developments should certainly never be disregarded in scenario development and interpretation still it appears justified that scholars have argued for scenario developers to embrace a wide range of uncertainties morgan and keith 2008 trutnevyte et al 2016 and to expect the unexpected cf bennett et al 2003 p√©rez soba and maas 2015 although biobam is also suitable for storyline based scenario development see section 3 1 it is designed for a different yet complementary approach to exploring complex interrelations and the implications of specific development paths instead of deriving small numbers of scenarios that each represent a particular worldview and maybe complementing them with sensitivity analyses regarding selected parameters the option space approach does not single out specific pathways it acknowledges the inherent unknowability of future long term developments of crucial influencing factors shifts attention to a wider scope of conceivable futures and thus supports a comprehensive view on systemic relations and dependencies irrespective of what is considered as plausible or realistic it furthermore allows to put specific parameter combinations i e one individual scenario in context to assess the weight of individual parameters i e whether diets or yields have a larger impact on e g ghg emissions and to generally embrace the large uncertainty of the future development of the global agri food system while biobam is not designed for assessing economic effects or determining optimal pathways it emphasizes the basic idea of scenario analysis to approach research questions involving complex systems from a what if perspective aiming for a deeper understanding of systemic interaction an exceptional feature of the biobam algorithms is that they are entirely based on biophysical parameters while many socio economic regulatory and legislative issues are deliberately disregarded this implies that biobam is suitable for other research questions than agro economic models and should thus not be seen as competing but rather complementary to other established modelling approaches the diagnostic approach and specific algorithms of biobam imply limitations that must be considered in study designs as well as scenario interpretation in accordance with its aims biobam calculates neither economic equilibria nor cost optimal development paths scenarios obtained with biobam are internally consistent in terms of biomass production and consumption or otherwise labelled as infeasible but may appear as improbable or even outlandish under current economic framework conditions the ex post evaluation of biobam scenarios is a viable option to gain insight into possible economic implications respectively the likelihood of scenarios under economic criteria see r√∂√∂s et al 2020 it should also be noted that core model parameters such as crop yields are defined exogenously while they could be significantly influenced by feedback mechanisms not reflected in the model for example shortage of cropland may lead to rising land prices and thus create stronger incentives for breeding high yielding crops than in a situation with lower demand for cropland while it is technically feasible to implement such feedback mechanisms their implementation in biobam would imply considerable changes in the model architecture this may represent a significant limitation for certain research questions the diagnostic nature of biobam scenarios and option spaces implies challenges for communicating results as most researchers and stakeholders are used to different modelling philosophies and objectives such as identifying likely or cost optimal pathways another challenge for communicating the results is associated with the model s capacity to derive global scenarios with multiple layers of geographic units this feature should not seduce users to interpret results for individual regions without considering the wider spatial context and underlying assumptions the model applications presented in this paper serve as examples for the types of studies biobam is designed for they concern biophysical possibilities and limitations at various spatial scales investigate relationships between agricultural demand and environmental pressures and explore pathways in food and agricultural systems beyond the conventional the explorative approach to scenario analysis supported by biobam is thus also particularly useful in connection with participatory processes where it can assist stakeholders in thinking out of the box and considering unconventional scenarios and their possible implications the presented scenarios on the expansion of agro ecological innovations in the eu are an illustrative example providing insight into how the ghg emissions and other environmental pressures of the eu agriculture and land sector could be reduced significantly through afforestation the land sector could even become a strong net carbon sink if europeans cut food wastes by 50 and switch to healthy diets with significantly less consumption of animal products as assumed in the scenarios lfs and laesyst in these local production scenarios the livestock sector shrinks by 70 and total crop production can be reduced substantially without adverse effects on self sufficiency the results from the second exemplary application section 3 2 on global afforestation potentials for climate mitigation illustrate the basic idea of an option space approach albeit with a relatively small option space i e a small number of scenarios in comparison to previous studies e g erb et al 2016 theurl et al 2020b we find a range for annual co2 sequestration from afforestation that compares well with ranges from previous studies considering fao based diets and zero to medium energy crop demand the carbon sink in 2050 accounts for 0 5 4 4 gt co2 yr without and 3 3 8 6 gt co2 yr with grassland intensification see si results from previous studies range from 0 5 to 7 gt co2 yr fuss et al 2018 lenton 2014 the option space further illustrates that the different crop yield projections according to fao 2018 have relatively small influence on afforestation potentials whereas the area used for energy crop cultivation based on ranges found in literature human diets and intensity of grassland use are major influencing factors while it is often difficult to identify the reasons for broad ranges in literature the option space approach it suitable for putting them into perspective and discloses sensitivities to multidimensional uncertainties credit authorship contribution statement gerald kalt conceptualization methodology software

24551,process based ecosystem carbon cycle models typically incorporate vegetation growth vegetation mortality and soil respiration as well as the biotic and environmental drivers that influence these variables however few spatially explicit process models can efficiently incorporate the influence of land cover change and carbon lateral movement at regional scales or high spatial resolution this study uses the land use and carbon scenario simulator lucas to demonstrate the development of a fast ecosystem model that not only considers the basic carbon cycle but also incorporates the impact of land cover change soil erosion and soil deposition as input to the lucas modeling framework we used the integrated biosphere simulator ibis to simulate a non spatial reference carbon cycling scenario without considering land cover change for the nisqually river watershed in the northwestern united states we then used the land change monitoring assessment and projection lcmap remotely sensed 30 m sequential land cover data to generate annual land change history for the nisqually river area from 1985 to 2017 and used the unit stream powered erosion and deposition model usped to estimate annual soil carbon lateral movement finally we combined the annual carbon outputs from ibis the land change history from lcmap and the soil erosion and deposition from usped within the lucas simulation framework results showed that from 1985 to 2017 along with the dynamic land cover changes total ecosystem biomass carbon increased from 11 4 to 18 6 tgc mainly due to forest growth total ecosystem soil carbon declined from 31 7 to 29 7 tgc but the overall loss in soil carbon was not uniform across land cover types forestland forest sector and grassland lost carbon while wetland developed land

often use a combination of remote sensing and process model approaches remote sensing can provide detectable land cover change and ecosystem disturbance information while process models can simulate ecosystem responses to both land cover and environmental changes however the difficulties in efficiently linking land change information with process models results in large uncertainties in estimates of ecosystem c stocks and fluxes houghton et al 1999 hurtt et al 2002 liu et al 2004 land use and land cover changes lucc exert a strong influence on ecosystem c budget calculations ipcc 2000 but quantifying the dynamic nature of lucc over large areas remains challenging loveland et al 2002 some previous lucc oriented c studies used reconstructed lucc history data houghton et al 1999 hurtt et al 2002 vemap members 1995 liu et al 2008 2011 at coarse spatial resolution or generated by interpolation from limited temporal coverage in recent years high spatial and temporal resolution lucc datasets have become available such as the sequential annual 30 m land change monitoring assessment and projection lcmap products produced by usgs lcmap provides high resolution 30 m land change information spanning large geographic extents conus the conterminous u s over extended periods 1985 2017 and at a higher frequency annual and sub annual than in the past rover et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 brown et al 2020 the lcmap dataset thus provides an opportunity to better quantify the lucc impact on ecosystem carbon cycle process based ecosystem models such as the integrated biosphere simulator ibis foley et al 1996 community land model clm duarte et al 2017 lpj sitch et al 2003 and daycent parton et al 1998 follow mass and energy balance and so can respond to environmental changes such as temperature and precipitation atmospheric co2 concentration and nitrogen deposition however current process models focus more on ecosystem growth and natural succession than complex human induced lucc although detailed management scale lucc information is now becoming available and technically can be used by process models process models still struggle with running high resolution simulations many process models simulate plant physiology process at daily sub daily or hourly time steps which means they have much longer run times than non process simulation models process models are therefore more commonly used to perform coarse spatial resolution 10 km simulations at national continental and global scales those spatial resolutions are much larger than the human operational land management scale e g 30 250 m and cannot confidently reflect land change impacts on carbon cycling with more land management scale lucc data becoming available upgraded process models that can use those data are emerging for example the parallel ibis liu et al 2020 model was applied for the conterminous u s at 1 km spatial resolution that specifically deals with the lucc information process based c models also have difficulty simulating lateral carbon transport across landscapes and from terrestrial to aquatic systems because these processes require incorporating spatial routing and neighbor cell interactions which increases computation time the land aquatic carbon transfer is among the areas of carbon cycle science with the most uncertainty global studies suggest that more than half of the carbon absorbed by land may be transferred to aquatic systems but adequate data and proper models to evaluate this process are lacking biddanda 2017 in this study we used the land use and carbon scenario simulator lucas to simulate c dynamics in the nisqually river watershed from 1985 to 2017 the lucas model is a relatively new carbon research tool framework developed by syncrosim and usgs scientists sleeter et al 2018 lucas provides a mechanism and platform to combine carbon modeling land cover change modeling and carbon redistribution at high spatial resolution with 10 000 times faster simulation speed than process based models the purpose of this modeling experiment is to demonstrate the construction of a rapid carbon model that adopts the basic carbon process of a complex biogeochemical model handles high resolution land change and its impacts on carbon stock and flux and also incorporates land cover change related lateral soil carbon erosion and deposition ed we mainly focused on the impacts of land cover change and soil erosion on c dynamics climate change effect is not analyzed 2 methods 2 1 the nisqually river watershed and key model input data the nisqually river watershed including a small portion of the adjacent costal region is on the central west coast of the state of washington fig 1 drains to puget sound and encompasses about 2415 km2 elevation ranges from 0 to 4375 m extending from sea level coastal wetland to high mountain glaciers mt rainier with upland vegetated ecosystems and developed urban areas in between temperature is favorable for vegetation growth but with very large ranges due to elevation differences annual mean precipitation ranges from 900 to 2500 mm average live biomass c density of a 100 year old forest stands can reach more than 20 kgc m2 soil oranic carbon soc is also very rich and averages more than 10 kgc m2 agricultural land and developed land are located at lower flat regions mountainous areas are mostly covered by forest and grassland the reference carbon flow lucc and ed are the three major input data of this lucas modeling study reference carbon flow data defines carbon cycle processes of an undisturbed ecosystem from age 1 to 100 years based on summarized ibis model carbon stock and carbon flow outputs which are converted to a series of age carbon lookup tables the lucc data are the 30 m lcmap products that are derived from the u s landsat analysis ready data ard we converted the lcmap annual primary land cover maps to annual land cover change maps by comparing land cover types between two adjecent years altogether 18 detectable land cover changes land transitions were included in our study the soil ed data calculated from the usped model are annual 30 m maps and used as spatial multipliers in lucas 2 2 overall land transitions the 1985 2017 annual lcmap data were used to initialize and track land cover change lcmap includes eight land cover types 1 developed 2 agriculture 3 shrubgrass 4 forest 5 openwater 6 wetland 7 snowice and 8 barren we focused on eighteen major land changes fig 2 excluding changes to barren and snow ice land cover types in this study due to minimal variation the eighteen land transitions are ecosystem disturbance events which usually bring drastic changes in carbon stock and flux as compared to natural ecosystem succession process in this study we didn t include disturbances like wildland fire and forest thinning because they are not necessarily associated with land cover type transitions 2 3 overall carbon cycle framework the carbon data were adapted from the ibis model s annual outputs and simplified to contain four pools and nine fluxes fig 3 the 4 pool 9 flux framework applies to forest agriculture grassland wetland and developed land new growth indicates photosynthesis product or net primary productivity npp which is an age dependent value derived from the ibis output a value extremely simplified from the ibis eco physiological calculations of npp removal includes disturbance related c loss such as forest clearing and agricultural harvest lit to co2 and soil to co2 are ecosystem heterotrophic respirations from litter and soil respectively soil to aquatic is initially a soil carbon leaching term from the ibis model but we also added the usped soil carbon erosion and deposition onto this flux to account for carbon movement due to surface runoff more details are described in the soil erosion model section for non forest ecosystems biomass has no allocation to wood mortality therefore deadwood and its related fluxes are zeros developed area was assumed to have a total of 20 of vegetation cover including tree shrub and grass therefore all the c pools and fluxes exist in developed areas this c flow diagram has no feedback loops that exist in ibis all model parameters mostly age dependent and non spatial were derived from ibis regional summaries the size or total number of parameters expands with increasing simulation years number of ecosystem types and number of sub regions carbon trend of an individual land pixel is a fixed curve unless land cover change modifies the curve differences between land pixels were reflected by initial land cover type initial age biomass litter soil carbon and annual land change and soil erosion 2 4 ibis carbon model equations four pools and nine fluxes ibis foley and others 1996 is a physically consistent process modeling system that has many liner and non liner equations and many fixed and dynamic parameters after we generalized the model s carbon cycle to a 4 pool 9 flux structure fig 3 the year end values of those pools and fluxes are used to calculate the lucas carbon look up tables for the carbon pools of ibis model macro equations are 1 1

decomposition of litter emission from litter and emission from soc respectively these equations represent processes in fig 3 in lucas new carbon pools were calculated from carbon fluxes each year the starting flux npp is an external absolute value determined by age and cover type other carbon fluxes depend on existing carbon pools and a set of carbon flow multipliers these multipliers were calculated offline as relative ratios from the originally ibis carbon pools and fluxes 1 5 m p n p p n p p 1 6 m p lit litf all bi o old npp 1 7 m p rem rem bi o old npp 1 8 m p mort mort bi o old npp

relevant flux parameters multipliers from the attribute table after that flux multipliers and existing carbon pools were used to calculate new fluxes and the new fluxes were used to calculate new pools base on eq 1 1 1 4 2 5 usped model equations soil c redistribution across landscape has become a major topic in c cycle science yang et al 2020 chappell et al 2016 traditional soil erosion model like the universal soil loss equation usle and the revised universal soil loss equation rusle may have overestimated soil erosion without considerations of deposition for example trimble and crosson 2000 reported that observed agricultural land sediment yields efflux were usually on the order of 0 5 to 2 0 mg ha 1yr 1 sediment delivered to streams from about a 3 km2 drainage area in the 1970s was only about 8 of the amount estimated by the usle model the usped is a 2 dimensional 2d annual soil erosion and deposition model originally developed by mitasova et al 1996 dem is used as terrain aspect slope and flow accumulation calculation the net erosion deposition is computed as a divergence of sediment flow i e change in a 2d field representing sediment flow in the direction of elevation surface gradient https ncsu geoforall lab github io erosion modeling tutorial erdep theory html in the model soil erosion and deposition mainly depended on the sediment transport capacity of the surface runoff 2 1 t k t q m sin b n where t is the sediment transport capacity kt is a transportability coefficient determined by soil type and vegetation cover q is a combined rainfall term that indicates the total amount of run off water from the upslope area that goes through a land pixel b is terrain slope and m and n are empirical exponents in usped kt is derived from three parameters used by the traditional rusle model 2 2 k t k c p where k is a soil erodibility factor 0 1 c is a land cover factor 0 1 and p is a land use support practice factor 0 1 the p factor describes the effect of man made architecture in controlling erosion usually given a value of 1 0 when neglected in our study we set p to 1 0 the q m term is further expressed as 2 3 q m r a w m where r factor is the rainfall intensity which is calculated from annual precipitation and ranges 90 160 for the study area and a w is the weighted upslope contributing area represented by weighted flow accumulation the a w term considers the land cover effects on surface runoff when land cover type changes a w will also change the weight values for different land cover type is listed in table 1 the final usped sediment transport capacity calculation for a given land pixel is 2 4 t r k c p a w m sin b n the actual annual soil erosion deposition is a divergence of the t 2 5 e d d t cos a d x d t sin a d y where a is the aspect of terrain surface and dx dy is the grid resolution next when we estimated carbon erosion deposition and the land cover change impacts we further applied two new ratios to the ed value 2 6 e d s o c r b c e d where edsoc is the soil carbon erosion deposition r is a scalar related to spatial resolution 1 0 for 10 m grid 1 1 for 30 m grid 1 5 for 240 m grid bc is soil carbon content 2 processes related to the creation and fate of dissolved organic carbon doc were not modeled in usped we only attached the soil carbon content bc to the amount of soil erosion as the overall c export a sensitivity test for bc was performed the soil k factor value 0 1 indicates the ease of soil detachment when raindrops hit the soil surface which is only dependent on soil type and is available in the u s soil database the c factor value 0 1 indicates the soil export reduction effect of a given land cover type for example forest has very limited carbon export but grassland could allow 43 times higher carbon export than forest the weight value 0 1 indicates the surface water flow reduction effect of specific land cover type for example forest is assumed to allow 50 potential runoff water to export as compared to grassland that allows 90 runoff water to export according to cooper 2011 the rainfall factor r can be calculated as 2 7 r 0 27 p 1 26 where p is the annual rainfall amount in unit of inch 1 inch 25 4 mm in this study we used the average annual rainfall derived from the 1971 2015 4 km monthly prism precipitation data daly 2008 the dem c factor r factor and k factor are displayed in fig 4 2 6 lucas model equations mathematically the lucas model performs look up table retrieval addition deduction and multiplication operations all those operations can be spatially referenced non spatial and spatially explicit the multiplication operation uses spatial and or non spatial multipliers which can be positive or negative values for biomass litterfall and wood mortality calculations lucas uses pre calculated ratios as non spatial multipliers 3 1 lit m p lit biom 3 2 dw m p mort biom where biom is the biomass of each individual land cell spatial explicit m p l i t m p m o r t are non spatial age dependent litterfall leaf root ratio multiplier and wood mortality ratio multiplier respectively values of m p l i t range from 0 161 to 0 024 for forest about 0 27 for agricultural land and around 0 5 for grassland and wetland values of m p m o r t applying only to forest ranged from 0 004 to 0 013 altogether about 4000 non spatial age dependent 1 100 years multipliers were applied for the carbon flows as described in fig 3 for soil carbon redistribution on the landscape usped calculated soil ed values need to be converted to soil carbon values we use the following equation 3 3 so c new so c old ed m p e m p s 3 4 m p e 2 47 10 c t s 0 005 whereas ed is the soil mass erosion deposition calculated from usped ton acre mpe is a non spatial lucas erosion flow multiplier which is a unit conversion factor with a value of 0 005 based on the assumption that erosion soil has 2 organic carbon content cts and erosion unit is converted from ton acre to kgc m2 the mps is a spatial scaling factor value 1 1 due to the change from 10 m resolution to 30 m resolution this mp s usage is because coarse spatial resolution will smooth fine scale terrain and therefore loses fine scale ed simple usped tests on a fixed watershed running at different spatial resolution proved this effect the ed are annual maps generated from usped and function as spatial multipliers lucas another set of spatial multipliers in lucas are the sequential land change maps from lcmap in this study there were18 land change events defined among the 8 land cover types see fig 2 altogether 576 lucc maps were used in lucas for the 1986 2017 simulation 2 7 model calibration and uncertainty each model we used had uncertainty to be evaluated or discussed lucas can do ensemble lucc simulations if given the land cover transition rates and variability and therefore can report uncertainty range however we actually used a set of fixed lcmap land cover which is deterministic in this study therefore we are only aware of the accuracy of lcamp dataset which is 82 5 pengra et al 2020 currently we are unable to convert this land cover uncertainty to c simulation uncertainty for the carbon model we performed non spatial ibis model calibrations on some carbon variables observed data included forest live biomass dead biomass agricultural yield harvest grassland npp wetland npp and soil carbon only the county level regional average numbers were used forest inventory derived c data cole www ncasi2 org gcole gcole shtml indicated that forest live biomass and dead wood at 100 year of age for the study region were 21 6 and 3 6 kgc m2 respectively therefore we used those numbers as our target forest output when we perform ibis 100 year forest calibration simulations to evaluate ibis biomass deadwood uncertainty we compared simulated biomass deadwood with fia cole data for each age class 5 100 instead of only the ending age class but we did not have observed carbon variables like soil c nbp to evaluate the model agricultural yield is extremely diversified by crop types ranging from 500 to 2500 g biomass m2 usda nass 2019 since wheat has the biggest planting acreage in the region we chose the wheat as the representative crop type which has a production rate of 400 g biomass m2 yr i e 200 gc m2 yr ibis grassland npp was compared with modis npp zhao et al 2005 which is 400 g c m2 yr wetland was assumed to have grassy biomass only in this study a recent coastal wetland synthesis for louisiana rivera monroy et al 2019 indicated that wetlands have a wide productivity npp range of 1500 to 3000 g m2 yr although our study is in the northwestern u s we adopted a generic value of 2000 g m2 i e 1000 gc m2 yr as the target npp since we treated those systems as annual non woody vegetations and only one npp number was used as available observation we couldn t evaluate the c uncertainty of those ecosystems as for usped soil erosion and deposition due to lack of data our results were only compared with some similar studies e g trimble and crosson 2000 and curran et al 2016 the later is a 24 year nisqually river watershed long term sediment transport monitoring study which is directly compared with our erosion results the usdafs carbon online estimator cole www ncasi2 org gcole gcole shtml data were used to calibrate our model s live biomass and deadwood to represent the general forest growth from age 1 to 100 years the 100 year forest growth data we used were the county level average of all tree species fig 5 because this average tree growth was more representative for local region we believe the models gave robust results when apply at region scales 3 results 3 1 land cover change in the nisqually river watershed the total land area simulated and analysed is 2307 km2 which include agricultural land 6 2 developed land 18 8 forest land 58 7 grassland 11 7 and wetland 4 5 in 2017 the changing area of each land cover type during 1985 2017 are shown in fig 6 where we can see that developed area had been continously increasing while forest and grassland areas both had up and down during the study period the net land area changes between year 1985 and year 2017 are listed in table 2 which indicate overall decreases in forest grassland and wetland areas but increases in agricultural land and developed land areas however actual land changes were bigger than the one time difference of the beginning year and end year because some land cells experienced mutiple land changes during the study period 3 2 soil erosion and soil carbon lateral redistribution calculated ed values for individual cells within the nisqually river watershed in 2017 range from 74 to 74 ton acre 183 to 183 ton ha 1 ha 2 47 acre with a mean value of 0 108 ton acre 0 27 ton ha negative ed values indicate soil loss erosion and positive values indicate soil gain deposition ed values 5 0 or 5 0 are seen as extreme values which are mostly along stream river cells and high slope cells such land cells account for 4 1 of total land area slightly higher than the sum of open water and snow ice area of the study region 3 3 therefore ed values greater than 5 0 are set to 5 0 and ed values less than 5 0 are set to 5 0 based on this treatment the mean annual soil ed is around 0 098 ton acre equal to 0 24 ton ha or 24 ton km2 the total ed for the study region 2396 km2 is about 57 8 gg per year indicating the overall soil loss of the watershed modelled net soil carbon ed in 2017 ranged from 0 0375 to 0 0375 kgc m2 with a mean of 0 0007 kgc m2 total 1 61 gg the erosion only locations 1550 km2 have a mean carbon ed of 0 0048 kgc m2 total 7 51 gg the deposition only locations 727 km2 have a mean carbon ed of 0 0081 kgc m2 total 5 91 gg carbon ed trends from 1985 to 2017 and carbon ed spatial distribution in 2017 are summarized in fig 7 the spatial distribution of soil carbon ed follows the hydrology pattern i e higher flow accumulation locations have higher erosion and deposition amounts high slope regions such as most of the mountainous forestland and grassland had significant erosion changes in soil carbon ed were driven by land cover type change annual precipitation variation and existing carbon content of local land cell and upslope contributing area the temporal trends of soil carbon erosion fig 8 indicated that developed land forest land and grassland were losing soil c due to erosion around 0 13 0 75 and 0 85 gg per year respectively wetland gained lateral c input with a magnitude of 0 22 gg per year including both upland freshwater wetland and coastal wetland agricultural land was c erosion neutral over the study period forest grassland and developed land had a cumulative carbon erosion of 36 5 14 0 and 4 8 gg respectively while wetland had a cumulative 7 1 gg of c deposition 3 3 carbon trends of the nisqually river watershed npp outputs indicated that from 1986 to 2017 total forest ecosystem npp increased from 865 to 1153 gg c per year although forest area decreased in the first 10 15 years fig 9 npp increase was mostly due to mean forest age increase but also linked with co2 fertilization during 1985 2017 which was accounted for in the process ibis model developed land sector had continuous increasing npp from 7 2 to 38 0 gg c meanly because its area was increasing grassland also had increasing npp in the first 10 15 years but decreased npp in the later years which matched with grassland area change npp of agricultural land increased and wetlands were stable due to their relative very low land area changes for total live biomass lucas results indicated there was 11 433 gg of living biomass c stored in the terrestrial ecosystems in 1985 and 18 606 gg c in 2017 forest occupied nearly 98 1 of total biomass c on nearly 60 of total land area as for soil c lucas indicated that forest soil c decreased from 18 330 gg to 16 606 gg in the first 15 years then became stable grassland soil c increased in the first 10 years then had decreased soil c developed land had a continuous increase of soil c most soil c changes were related to land area changes and lateral soil redistribution although forest age might also have some effects 3 4 model bias and uncertainty on biomass and erosion with limited observation data we only report uncertainty of several c variables for forest of age 10 80 years the living biomass c simulated by ibis have a bias of 1 37 kg c m2 the root mean square error rmse is 1 46 kg c m2 similarly the deadwood bias is 0 2 kg c m2 rmse is 0 3 kg c m2 fig 10 simulated annual soil erosion was compared with observed sediment loads fig 11 the average and median sediment load from observation was 94 and 63 gg per year respectively the difference is mainly due to an extreme sediment load value in 1996 the average and median of simulated usped soil erosion was 58 and 56 gg respectively bias between simulation and observation median value is 20 mg per year the rmse is 61 mg simulated soil c erosion was 30 lower than the long term gage monitoring data for the period 1980 2014 annual based analysis show that usped didn t reproduce the interannual sediment load variability and had a rmse of 20 ton yr 4 discussion and conclusion continuous land cover map series with appropriate spatial resolution e g 10 to 250 m can capture detailed land change information especially human land use change activities continuous large regional 30 m land cover products have recently become available e g the lcmap data and innovative new data such as earth monitoring analysis and projection earthmap jenny et al 2017 are underway some higher resolution remote sensing products for small regional coverage such as lidar products are also frequently produced however most current large scale carbon models lack the ability to incorporate this lucc information and therefore seldom able to report detailed human impacts on the carbon cycle also when projecting future ecosystem carbon status for large regions the size of land change scenarios interacts with climate scenarios which makes it more difficult for those models to effectively evaluate potential human impacts the lucas approach is an effective solution to the problem at the regional scale although super computing new remote sensing technology atmospheric model inversions and artificial intelligence applications may also help to tackle the problem our modeling exercise serves as a proof of concept that large scale spatially explicit fast realistic and low cost carbon models can be built to reflect land management scale human impacts in our modeling exercise abstracting a process model to a look up table format makes the model s parameters static despite the potential to shift with environmental change it also eliminates many feedbacks within the process model therefore such a model cannot easily or directly explore plant physiological responses to changes in atmospheric co2 shifting of temperature and precipitation and soil n availability although it is a very powerful approach to analyze lucc effects that said there have been some attempts recently to add ecosystem responses to non lucc environmental changes in lucas such as using dynamic npp to reflect climate change and co2 fertilization effects and using dynamic q10 to model soil response to warming sleeter et al 2019 since the lucas framework can perform map addition and multiplication there is a great potential that ecosystem feedbacks can be partly represented in future modeling applications through extensive use of multipliers a multiplier is a simplification of model equation s using more multipliers potentially makes the model more process based determining the complexity of a lucas model needs to balance between available data and carbon process details the usped model has been widely validated against field observations in small watersheds e g liu et al 2007 and warren et al 2019 in general the model successfully estimates soil ed and is more realistic than the traditional rusle model because it accounts for soil deposition for large scale applications such as the three national level large river basins in china yang et al 2020 usped also yielded good correlation between gage monitoring and model output for our study region the overall annual soil erosion rate of 0 24 mg ha 1 for all land covers is comparable to but lower than the global general agricultural land soil erosion synthesis from trimble and crosson 2000 0 5 2 0 ton ha since usped uses empirical parameters m n and was initially developed using a 10 m dem we will be able to further refine the optimum parameter values for a specific study region as long as observation data are available the usped model s spatial resolution for large regional applications is an obvious uncertain area using a scaler for spatial resolution change in usped e g the mps parameter in this study is one approach to tackle the problem as for soil c erosion amount it was assumed to be attached with the sediment load it also assumed that eroded soils had a c content of around 2 which is arbitrary and can be improved in this study we demonstrated the integration of a soil erosion model and a carbon cycle process model in lucas in addition to the many process models existing today empirical carbon models and raw observations from forest inventory data or flux tower measurements can also be incorporated into lucas this flexibility is because lucas simply needs a summarized carbon trend temporal table of an ecosystem either from models or measurements therefore the lucas modeling approach is highly extensible to include multiple and diversified models and thus is an ideal candidate of carbon model inter comparison tools author contributions jinxun liu performed the ibis usped and lucas model simulations benjamin sleeter jiaojiao diao and paul selmants

24551,process based ecosystem carbon cycle models typically incorporate vegetation growth vegetation mortality and soil respiration as well as the biotic and environmental drivers that influence these variables however few spatially explicit process models can efficiently incorporate the influence of land cover change and carbon lateral movement at regional scales or high spatial resolution this study uses the land use and carbon scenario simulator lucas to demonstrate the development of a fast ecosystem model that not only considers the basic carbon cycle but also incorporates the impact of land cover change soil erosion and soil deposition as input to the lucas modeling framework we used the integrated biosphere simulator ibis to simulate a non spatial reference carbon cycling scenario without considering land cover change for the nisqually river watershed in the northwestern united states we then used the land change monitoring assessment and projection lcmap remotely sensed 30 m sequential land cover data to generate annual land change history for the nisqually river area from 1985 to 2017 and used the unit stream powered erosion and deposition model usped to estimate annual soil carbon lateral movement finally we combined the annual carbon outputs from ibis the land change history from lcmap and the soil erosion and deposition from usped within the lucas simulation framework results showed that from 1985 to 2017 along with the dynamic land cover changes total ecosystem biomass carbon increased from 11 4 to 18 6 tgc mainly due to forest growth total ecosystem soil carbon declined from 31 7 to 29 7 tgc but the overall loss in soil carbon was not uniform across land cover types forestland forest sector and grassland lost carbon while wetland developed land

information spanning large geographic extents conus the conterminous u s over extended periods 1985 2017 and at a higher frequency annual and sub annual than in the past rover et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 brown et al 2020 the lcmap dataset thus provides an opportunity to better quantify the lucc impact on ecosystem carbon cycle process based ecosystem models such as the integrated biosphere simulator ibis foley et al 1996 community land model clm duarte et al 2017 lpj sitch et al 2003 and daycent parton et al 1998 follow mass and energy balance and so can respond to environmental changes such as temperature and precipitation atmospheric co2 concentration and nitrogen deposition however current process models focus more on ecosystem growth and natural succession than complex human induced lucc although detailed management scale lucc information is now becoming available and technically can be used by process models process models still struggle with running high resolution simulations many process models simulate plant physiology process at daily sub daily or hourly time steps which means they have much longer run times than non process simulation models process models are therefore more commonly used to perform coarse spatial resolution 10 km simulations at national continental and global scales those spatial resolutions are much larger than the human operational land management scale e g 30 250 m and cannot confidently reflect land change impacts on carbon cycling with more land management scale lucc data becoming available upgraded process models that can use those data are emerging for example the parallel ibis liu et al 2020 model was applied for the conterminous u s at 1 km spatial resolution that specifically deals with the lucc information process based c models also have difficulty simulating lateral carbon transport across landscapes and from terrestrial to aquatic systems because these processes require incorporating spatial routing and neighbor cell interactions which increases computation time the land aquatic carbon transfer is among the areas of carbon cycle science with the most uncertainty global studies suggest that more than half of the carbon absorbed by land may be transferred to aquatic systems but adequate data and proper models to evaluate this process are lacking biddanda 2017 in this study we used the land use and carbon scenario simulator lucas to simulate c dynamics in the nisqually river watershed from 1985 to 2017 the lucas model is a relatively new carbon research tool framework developed by syncrosim and usgs scientists sleeter et al 2018 lucas provides a mechanism and platform to combine carbon modeling land cover change modeling and carbon redistribution at high spatial resolution with 10 000 times faster simulation speed than process based models the purpose of this modeling experiment is to demonstrate the construction of a rapid carbon model that adopts the basic carbon process of a complex biogeochemical model handles high resolution land change and its impacts on carbon stock and flux and also incorporates land cover change related lateral soil carbon erosion and deposition ed we mainly focused on the impacts of land cover change and soil erosion on c dynamics climate change effect is not analyzed 2 methods 2 1 the nisqually river watershed and key model input data the nisqually river watershed including a small portion of the adjacent costal region is on the central west coast of the state of washington fig 1 drains to puget sound and encompasses about 2415 km2 elevation ranges from 0 to 4375 m extending from sea level coastal wetland to high mountain glaciers mt rainier with upland vegetated ecosystems and developed urban areas in between temperature is favorable for vegetation growth but with very large ranges due to elevation differences annual mean precipitation ranges from 900 to 2500 mm average live biomass c density of a 100 year old forest stands can reach more than 20 kgc m2 soil oranic carbon soc is also very rich and averages more than 10 kgc m2 agricultural land and developed land are located at lower flat regions mountainous areas are mostly covered by forest and grassland the reference carbon flow lucc and ed are the three major input data of this lucas modeling study reference carbon flow data defines carbon cycle processes of an undisturbed ecosystem from age 1 to 100 years based on summarized ibis model carbon stock and carbon flow outputs which are converted to a series of age carbon lookup tables the lucc data are the 30 m lcmap products that are derived from the u s landsat analysis ready data ard we converted the lcmap annual primary land cover maps to annual land cover change maps by comparing land cover types between two adjecent years altogether 18 detectable land cover changes land transitions were included in our study the soil ed data calculated from the usped model are annual 30 m maps and used as spatial multipliers in lucas 2 2 overall land transitions the 1985 2017 annual lcmap data were used to initialize and track land cover change lcmap includes eight land cover types 1 developed 2 agriculture 3 shrubgrass 4 forest 5 openwater 6 wetland 7 snowice and 8 barren we focused on eighteen major land changes fig 2 excluding changes to barren and snow ice land cover types in this study due to minimal variation the eighteen land transitions are ecosystem disturbance events which usually bring drastic changes in carbon stock and flux as compared to natural ecosystem succession process in this study we didn t include disturbances like wildland fire and forest thinning because they are not necessarily associated with land cover type transitions 2 3 overall carbon cycle framework the carbon data were adapted from the ibis model s annual outputs and simplified to contain four pools and nine fluxes fig 3 the 4 pool 9 flux framework applies to forest agriculture grassland wetland and developed land new growth indicates photosynthesis product or net primary productivity npp which is an age dependent value derived from the ibis output a value extremely simplified from the ibis eco physiological calculations of npp removal includes disturbance related c loss such as forest clearing and agricultural harvest lit to co2 and soil to co2 are ecosystem heterotrophic respirations from litter and soil respectively soil to aquatic is initially a soil carbon leaching term from the ibis model but we also added the usped soil carbon erosion and deposition onto this flux to account for carbon movement due to surface runoff more details are described in the soil erosion model section for non forest ecosystems biomass has no allocation to wood mortality therefore deadwood and its related fluxes are zeros developed area was assumed to have a total of 20 of vegetation cover including tree shrub and grass therefore all the c pools and fluxes exist in developed areas this c flow diagram has no feedback loops that exist in ibis all model parameters mostly age dependent and non spatial were derived from ibis regional summaries the size or total number of parameters expands with increasing simulation years number of ecosystem types and number of sub regions carbon trend of an individual land pixel is a fixed curve unless land cover change modifies the curve differences between land pixels were reflected by initial land cover type initial age biomass litter soil carbon and annual land change and soil erosion 2 4 ibis carbon model equations four pools and nine fluxes ibis foley and others 1996 is a physically consistent process modeling system that has many liner and non liner equations and many fixed and dynamic parameters after we generalized the model s carbon cycle to a 4 pool 9 flux structure fig 3 the year end values of those pools and fluxes are used to calculate the lucas carbon look up tables for the carbon pools of ibis model macro equations are 1 1

decomposition of litter emission from litter and emission from soc respectively these equations represent processes in fig 3 in lucas new carbon pools were calculated from carbon fluxes each year the starting flux npp is an external absolute value determined by age and cover type other carbon fluxes depend on existing carbon pools and a set of carbon flow multipliers these multipliers were calculated offline as relative ratios from the originally ibis carbon pools and fluxes 1 5 m p n p p n p p 1 6 m p lit litf all bi o old npp 1 7 m p rem rem bi o old npp 1 8 m p mort mort bi o old npp

relevant flux parameters multipliers from the attribute table after that flux multipliers and existing carbon pools were used to calculate new fluxes and the new fluxes were used to calculate new pools base on eq 1 1 1 4 2 5 usped model equations soil c redistribution across landscape has become a major topic in c cycle science yang et al 2020 chappell et al 2016 traditional soil erosion model like the universal soil loss equation usle and the revised universal soil loss equation rusle may have overestimated soil erosion without considerations of deposition for example trimble and crosson 2000 reported that observed agricultural land sediment yields efflux were usually on the order of 0 5 to 2 0 mg ha 1yr 1 sediment delivered to streams from about a 3 km2 drainage area in the 1970s was only about 8 of the amount estimated by the usle model the usped is a 2 dimensional 2d annual soil erosion and deposition model originally developed by mitasova et al 1996 dem is used as terrain aspect slope and flow accumulation calculation the net erosion deposition is computed as a divergence of sediment flow i e change in a 2d field representing sediment flow in the direction of elevation surface gradient https ncsu geoforall lab github io erosion modeling tutorial erdep theory html in the model soil erosion and deposition mainly depended on the sediment transport capacity of the surface runoff 2 1 t k t q m sin b n where t is the sediment transport capacity kt is a transportability coefficient determined by soil type and vegetation cover q is a combined rainfall term that indicates the total amount of run off water from the upslope area that goes through a land pixel b is terrain slope and m and n are empirical exponents in usped kt is derived from three parameters used by the traditional rusle model 2 2 k t k c p where k is a soil erodibility factor 0 1 c is a land cover factor 0 1 and p is a land use support practice factor 0 1 the p factor describes the effect of man made architecture in controlling erosion usually given a value of 1 0 when neglected in our study we set p to 1 0 the q m term is further expressed as 2 3 q m r a w m where r factor is the rainfall intensity which is calculated from annual precipitation and ranges 90 160 for the study area and a w is the weighted upslope contributing area represented by weighted flow accumulation the a w term considers the land cover effects on surface runoff when land cover type changes a w will also change the weight values for different land cover type is listed in table 1 the final usped sediment transport capacity calculation for a given land pixel is 2 4 t r k c p a w m sin b n the actual annual soil erosion deposition is a divergence of the t 2 5 e d d t cos a d x d t sin a d y where a is the aspect of terrain surface and dx dy is the grid resolution next when we estimated carbon erosion deposition and the land cover change impacts we further applied two new ratios to the ed value 2 6 e d s o c r b c e d where edsoc is the soil carbon erosion deposition r is a scalar related to spatial resolution 1 0 for 10 m grid 1 1 for 30 m grid 1 5 for 240 m grid bc is soil carbon content 2 processes related to the creation and fate of dissolved organic carbon doc were not modeled in usped we only attached the soil carbon content bc to the amount of soil erosion as the overall c export a sensitivity test for bc was performed the soil k factor value 0 1 indicates the ease of soil detachment when raindrops hit the soil surface which is only dependent on soil type and is available in the u s soil database the c factor value 0 1 indicates the soil export reduction effect of a given land cover type for example forest has very limited carbon export but grassland could allow 43 times higher carbon export than forest the weight value 0 1 indicates the surface water flow reduction effect of specific land cover type for example forest is assumed to allow 50 potential runoff water to export as compared to grassland that allows 90 runoff water to export according to cooper 2011 the rainfall factor r can be calculated as 2 7 r 0 27 p 1 26 where p is the annual rainfall amount in unit of inch 1 inch 25 4 mm in this study we used the average annual rainfall derived from the 1971 2015 4 km monthly prism precipitation data daly 2008 the dem c factor r factor and k factor are displayed in fig 4 2 6 lucas model equations mathematically the lucas model performs look up table retrieval addition deduction and multiplication operations all those operations can be spatially referenced non spatial and spatially explicit the multiplication operation uses spatial and or non spatial multipliers which can be positive or negative values for biomass litterfall and wood mortality calculations lucas uses pre calculated ratios as non spatial multipliers 3 1 lit m p lit biom 3 2 dw m p mort biom where biom is the biomass of each individual land cell spatial explicit m p l i t m p m o r t are non spatial age dependent litterfall leaf root ratio multiplier and wood mortality ratio multiplier respectively values of m p l i t range from 0 161 to 0 024 for forest about 0 27 for agricultural land and around 0 5 for grassland and wetland values of m p m o r t applying only to forest ranged from 0 004 to 0 013 altogether about 4000 non spatial age dependent 1 100 years multipliers were applied for the carbon flows as described in fig 3 for soil carbon redistribution on the landscape usped calculated soil ed values need to be converted to soil carbon values we use the following equation 3 3 so c new so c old ed m p e m p s 3 4 m p e 2 47 10 c t s 0 005 whereas ed is the soil mass erosion deposition calculated from usped ton acre mpe is a non spatial lucas erosion flow multiplier which is a unit conversion factor with a value of 0 005 based on the assumption that erosion soil has 2 organic carbon content cts and erosion unit is converted from ton acre to kgc m2 the mps is a spatial scaling factor value 1 1 due to the change from 10 m resolution to 30 m resolution this mp s usage is because coarse spatial resolution will smooth fine scale terrain and therefore loses fine scale ed simple usped tests on a fixed watershed running at different spatial resolution proved this effect the ed are annual maps generated from usped and function as spatial multipliers lucas another set of spatial multipliers in lucas are the sequential land change maps from lcmap in this study there were18 land change events defined among the 8 land cover types see fig 2 altogether 576 lucc maps were used in lucas for the 1986 2017 simulation 2 7 model calibration and uncertainty each model we used had uncertainty to be evaluated or discussed lucas can do ensemble lucc simulations if given the land cover transition rates and variability and therefore can report uncertainty range however we actually used a set of fixed lcmap land cover which is deterministic in this study therefore we are only aware of the accuracy of lcamp dataset which is 82 5 pengra et al 2020 currently we are unable to convert this land cover uncertainty to c simulation uncertainty for the carbon model we performed non spatial ibis model calibrations on some carbon variables observed data included forest live biomass dead biomass agricultural yield harvest grassland npp wetland npp and soil carbon only the county level regional average numbers were used forest inventory derived c data cole www ncasi2 org gcole gcole shtml indicated that forest live biomass and dead wood at 100 year of age for the study region were 21 6 and 3 6 kgc m2 respectively therefore we used those numbers as our target forest output when we perform ibis 100 year forest calibration simulations to evaluate ibis biomass deadwood uncertainty we compared simulated biomass deadwood with fia cole data for each age class 5 100 instead of only the ending age class but we did not have observed carbon variables like soil c nbp to evaluate the model agricultural yield is extremely diversified by crop types ranging from 500 to 2500 g biomass m2 usda nass 2019 since wheat has the biggest planting acreage in the region we chose the wheat as the representative crop type which has a production rate of 400 g biomass m2 yr i e 200 gc m2 yr ibis grassland npp was compared with modis npp zhao et al 2005 which is 400 g c m2 yr wetland was assumed to have grassy biomass only in this study a recent coastal wetland synthesis for louisiana rivera monroy et al 2019 indicated that wetlands have a wide productivity npp range of 1500 to 3000 g m2 yr although our study is in the northwestern u s we adopted a generic value of 2000 g m2 i e 1000 gc m2 yr as the target npp since we treated those systems as annual non woody vegetations and only one npp number was used as available observation we couldn t evaluate the c uncertainty of those ecosystems as for usped soil erosion and deposition due to lack of data our results were only compared with some similar studies e g trimble and crosson 2000 and curran et al 2016 the later is a 24 year nisqually river watershed long term sediment transport monitoring study which is directly compared with our erosion results the usdafs carbon online estimator cole www ncasi2 org gcole gcole shtml data were used to calibrate our model s live biomass and deadwood to represent the general forest growth from age 1 to 100 years the 100 year forest growth data we used were the county level average of all tree species fig 5 because this average tree growth was more representative for local region we believe the models gave robust results when apply at region scales 3 results 3 1 land cover change in the nisqually river watershed the total land area simulated and analysed is 2307 km2 which include agricultural land 6 2 developed land 18 8 forest land 58 7 grassland 11 7 and wetland 4 5 in 2017 the changing area of each land cover type during 1985 2017 are shown in fig 6 where we can see that developed area had been continously increasing while forest and grassland areas both had up and down during the study period the net land area changes between year 1985 and year 2017 are listed in table 2 which indicate overall decreases in forest grassland and wetland areas but increases in agricultural land and developed land areas however actual land changes were bigger than the one time difference of the beginning year and end year because some land cells experienced mutiple land changes during the study period 3 2 soil erosion and soil carbon lateral redistribution calculated ed values for individual cells within the nisqually river watershed in 2017 range from 74 to 74 ton acre 183 to 183 ton ha 1 ha 2 47 acre with a mean value of 0 108 ton acre 0 27 ton ha negative ed values indicate soil loss erosion and positive values indicate soil gain deposition ed values 5 0 or 5 0 are seen as extreme values which are mostly along stream river cells and high slope cells such land cells account for 4 1 of total land area slightly higher than the sum of open water and snow ice area of the study region 3 3 therefore ed values greater than 5 0 are set to 5 0 and ed values less than 5 0 are set to 5 0 based on this treatment the mean annual soil ed is around 0 098 ton acre equal to 0 24 ton ha or 24 ton km2 the total ed for the study region 2396 km2 is about 57 8 gg per year indicating the overall soil loss of the watershed modelled net soil carbon ed in 2017 ranged from 0 0375 to 0 0375 kgc m2 with a mean of 0 0007 kgc m2 total 1 61 gg the erosion only locations 1550 km2 have a mean carbon ed of 0 0048 kgc m2 total 7 51 gg the deposition only locations 727 km2 have a mean carbon ed of 0 0081 kgc m2 total 5 91 gg carbon ed trends from 1985 to 2017 and carbon ed spatial distribution in 2017 are summarized in fig 7 the spatial distribution of soil carbon ed follows the hydrology pattern i e higher flow accumulation locations have higher erosion and deposition amounts high slope regions such as most of the mountainous forestland and grassland had significant erosion changes in soil carbon ed were driven by land cover type change annual precipitation variation and existing carbon content of local land cell and upslope contributing area the temporal trends of soil carbon erosion fig 8 indicated that developed land forest land and grassland were losing soil c due to erosion around 0 13 0 75 and 0 85 gg per year respectively wetland gained lateral c input with a magnitude of 0 22 gg per year including both upland freshwater wetland and coastal wetland agricultural land was c erosion neutral over the study period forest grassland and developed land had a cumulative carbon erosion of 36 5 14 0 and 4 8 gg respectively while wetland had a cumulative 7 1 gg of c deposition 3 3 carbon trends of the nisqually river watershed npp outputs indicated that from 1986 to 2017 total forest ecosystem npp increased from 865 to 1153 gg c per year although forest area decreased in the first 10 15 years fig 9 npp increase was mostly due to mean forest age increase but also linked with co2 fertilization during 1985 2017 which was accounted for in the process ibis model developed land sector had continuous increasing npp from 7 2 to 38 0 gg c meanly because its area was increasing grassland also had increasing npp in the first 10 15 years but decreased npp in the later years which matched with grassland area change npp of agricultural land increased and wetlands were stable due to their relative very low land area changes for total live biomass lucas results indicated there was 11 433 gg of living biomass c stored in the terrestrial ecosystems in 1985 and 18 606 gg c in 2017 forest occupied nearly 98 1 of total biomass c on nearly 60 of total land area as for soil c lucas indicated that forest soil c decreased from 18 330 gg to 16 606 gg in the first 15 years then became stable grassland soil c increased in the first 10 years then had decreased soil c developed land had a continuous increase of soil c most soil c changes were related to land area changes and lateral soil redistribution although forest age might also have some effects 3 4 model bias and uncertainty on biomass and erosion with limited observation data we only report uncertainty of several c variables for forest of age 10 80 years the living biomass c simulated by ibis have a bias of 1 37 kg c m2 the root mean square error rmse is 1 46 kg c m2 similarly the deadwood bias is 0 2 kg c m2 rmse is 0 3 kg c m2 fig 10 simulated annual soil erosion was compared with observed sediment loads fig 11 the average and median sediment load from observation was 94 and 63 gg per year respectively the difference is mainly due to an extreme sediment load value in 1996 the average and median of simulated usped soil erosion was 58 and 56 gg respectively bias between simulation and observation median value is 20 mg per year the rmse is 61 mg simulated soil c erosion was 30 lower than the long term gage monitoring data for the period 1980 2014 annual based analysis show that usped didn t reproduce the interannual sediment load variability and had a rmse of 20 ton yr 4 discussion and conclusion continuous land cover map series with appropriate spatial resolution e g 10 to 250 m can capture detailed land change information especially human land use change activities continuous large regional 30 m land cover products have recently become available e g the lcmap data and innovative new data such as earth monitoring analysis and projection earthmap jenny et al 2017 are underway some higher resolution remote sensing products for small regional coverage such as lidar products are also frequently produced however most current large scale carbon models lack the ability to incorporate this lucc information and therefore seldom able to report detailed human impacts on the carbon cycle also when projecting future ecosystem carbon status for large regions the size of land change scenarios interacts with climate scenarios which makes it more difficult for those models to effectively evaluate potential human impacts the lucas approach is an effective solution to the problem at the regional scale although super computing new remote sensing technology atmospheric model inversions and artificial intelligence applications may also help to tackle the problem our modeling exercise serves as a proof of concept that large scale spatially explicit fast realistic and low cost carbon models can be built to reflect land management scale human impacts in our modeling exercise abstracting a process model to a look up table format makes the model s parameters static despite the potential to shift with environmental change it also eliminates many feedbacks within the process model therefore such a model cannot easily or directly explore plant physiological responses to changes in atmospheric co2 shifting of temperature and precipitation and soil n availability although it is a very powerful approach to analyze lucc effects that said there have been some attempts recently to add ecosystem responses to non lucc environmental changes in lucas such as using dynamic npp to reflect climate change and co2 fertilization effects and using dynamic q10 to model soil response to warming sleeter et al 2019 since the lucas framework can perform map addition and multiplication there is a great potential that ecosystem feedbacks can be partly represented in future modeling applications through extensive use of multipliers a multiplier is a simplification of model equation s using more multipliers potentially makes the model more process based determining the complexity of a lucas model needs to balance between available data and carbon process details the usped model has been widely validated against field observations in small watersheds e g liu et al 2007 and warren et al 2019 in general the model successfully estimates soil ed and is more realistic than the traditional rusle model because it accounts for soil deposition for large scale applications such as the three national level large river basins in china yang et al 2020 usped also yielded good correlation between gage monitoring and model output for our study region the overall annual soil erosion rate of 0 24 mg ha 1 for all land covers is comparable to but lower than the global general agricultural land soil erosion synthesis from trimble and crosson 2000 0 5 2 0 ton ha since usped uses empirical parameters m n and was initially developed using a 10 m dem we will be able to further refine the optimum parameter values for a specific study region as long as observation data are available the usped model s spatial resolution for large regional applications is an obvious uncertain area using a scaler for spatial resolution change in usped e g the mps parameter in this study is one approach to tackle the problem as for soil c erosion amount it was assumed to be attached with the sediment load it also assumed that eroded soils had a c content of around 2 which is arbitrary and can be improved in this study we demonstrated the integration of a soil erosion model and a carbon cycle process model in lucas in addition to the many process models existing today empirical carbon models and raw observations from forest inventory data or flux tower measurements can also be incorporated into lucas this flexibility is because lucas simply needs a summarized carbon trend temporal table of an ecosystem either from models or measurements therefore the lucas modeling approach is highly extensible to include multiple and diversified models and thus is an ideal candidate of carbon model inter comparison tools author contributions jinxun liu performed the ibis usped and lucas model simulations benjamin sleeter jiaojiao diao and paul selmants

24552,the state of the art of epidemic modelling in terrestrial ecosystems is the compartmental sir model and its extensions from the now classical work of kermack mackendrick in contrast epidemic modelling of marine ecosystems is a bit behind and compartmental models have been introduced only recently one of the reasons is that many epidemic processes in terrestrial ecosystems can be described through a contact process while modelling marine epidemics is more subtle in many cases here we present a model describing disease outbreaks caused by parasites in bivalve populations the sirp model is a multicompartmental model with four compartments three of which describe the different states of the host susceptible i e healthy s infected i and removed dead r and one compartment for the parasite in the marine medium p written as a 4 dimensional dynamical system even if this is the simplest model one can write to describe this system it is still too complicated for both direct analytical manipulation and direct comparison with experimental observations as it depends on four parameters to be fitted we show that it is possible to simplify the model including a reduction to the standard sir model if the parameters fulfil certain conditions the model is validated with available data for the recent mass mortality event of the noble pen shell pinna nobilis a disease caused by the parasite haplosporidium pinnae showing that the reduced sir model is able to fit the data so we show that a model in which the species that suffers the epidemics host cannot move and contagion occurs through parasites can be reduced to the standard sir model that represents epidemic transmission between mobile hosts the fit indicates that the assumptions made to simplify the model are reasonable in practice although it leads to an indeterminacy in three of the original parameters this opens the possibility of performing direct experiments to be able to solve this question graphical abstract keywords epidemics mathematical model compartmental model bivalve diseases pinna nobilis haplosporidium pinnae 1 introduction marine organisms like their terrestrial counterparts can serve as hosts for a diversity of parasites and pathogens present in the ecosystem which are directly responsible for disease outbreaks disease induced mortality affects not only the host population but can cascade through the whole ecosystem altering its structure and functioning ward and lafferty 2004 furthermore climate change can increase the spread range and impact of parasites and pathogens burge et al 2014 in fact marine infectious diseases are recently increasing due to climate change and other anthropogenic pressures like pollution and overfishing lafferty et al 2004 this in turn threatens many valuable ecologically habitats and can also result in substantial economic losses in e g aquaculture lafferty et al 2015 analysing the impact of these events at appropriate scales spatial and temporal and biological organisation levels species populations and communities is crucial to accurately anticipate future changes in marine ecosystems and propose adapted management and conservation plans pairaud et al 2014 thus there is a strong need to address the mechanism of disease propagation in marine organisms however the state of the art of epidemiological studies in marine ecosystems lags behind that of terrestrial ecosystems harvell et al 2004 contact and vector borne based infectious diseases of terrestrial vertebrates and their epidemiology are typically studied using variations of the classical formulation of kermack and mckendrick kermack and mckendrick 1927 1932 1933 the sir model among other things this formalism allows to understand why epizootics spread and stop as the propagation of a disease is a threshold phenomenon anderson 1991 regulated by the now commonplace r 0 dimensionless number within this framework the initiation of epidemic transmission occurs when an infected individual is in close contact with a susceptible host or through a transmission vector as typically pathogens can only survive for a very limited time outside the host in an aerial environment on the other hand as air is typically a much harsher medium for pathogens than water the sea is expected to host a large number of pathogens viruses bacteria and parasites for a relatively long time the longer life span of pathogens in a water medium together with the increased buoyancy arising from the different physical properties of seawater and air coupled to the existence of marine currents that can transmit pathogens for long distances away allows diseases to spread faster and reach further distances in marine environments compared to epidemics in terrestrial systems cantrell et al 2020 as a result the possible long term transmission of parasites by currents in marine environments make them more prone to suffer from persistent zoonotics compared to terrestrial ecosystems where for an epidemic outbreak to occur the presence of an initial infected host or vector is necessary within a susceptible population until quite recently marine zoonotics were mostly studied using different models compared to terrestrial diseases and it was not even clear whether the same tools could be applied mccallum et al 2004 the abundance of pathogens in marine ecosystems is one of the reasons why proliferation models that do not focus on transmission and assume a widespread occurrence of the pathogen and a rapid transmission problem have been most popular in the field powell and hofmann 2015 in fact compartmental models are starting to be used only recently in the study of marine epizootics bidegain et al 2016b an important subset of marine organisms are sessile e g bivalves which means that they cannot move in the case of sessile terrestrial organisms disease transmission occurs mostly through vectors insects that transmit the pathogens causing the disease instead in marine ecosystems disease transmission is most often waterborne in particular in passive water filtering feeders as is the case of bivalves recently some compartmental models considering the pathogen population have been recently proposed to study particular bivalve epidemics bidegain et al 2016a b 2017 in the present work we analyse a model that is aimed to describe disease transmission from an infected immobile host to a susceptible one of the same species through waterborne parasites that are explicitly described the model is closely related to the sip model introduced in bidegain et al 2016b in this first study we analyse in detail the properties of the mean field version of the model that aims to describe spatially homogeneous i e well mixed populations the well mixed approximation will be valid whenever the mean distance among hosts is smaller than the mixing length of the parasites before they get inactivated or absorbed the model is written such that waterborne transmission is the only mechanism by which one infected immobile host can infect a healthy one and thus does not describe infection through direct contact it is also assumed that the infected hosts as invertebrates do not have immune memory and that the probability that an infected individual recovers is small and can be neglected thus the model is not adequate to study infection of highly aggregated molluscs like some mussels or other passive filters like corals as for these hosts one should also include the possibility of infection through direct contact a very timely case study of such emerging epidemics is the noble fan mussel or pen shell pinna nobilis this fan mussel is the largest endemic bivalve in the mediterranean sea and is under a serious extinction risk due to a mass mortality event mme that has occurred throughout the whole mediterranean basin very recently garc√≠a march et al 2020 zotou et al 2020 v√°zquez luis et al 2017 right before this mme it was distributed across a wide type of habitats including coastal and paralic ecosystems at depths between 0 5 to 60 m butler et al 1993 prado et al 2020 in open coastal waters the distribution of the species is mainly associated with seagrass meadows typically of posidonia oceanica which has been indicated as its optimal habitat hendriks et al 2011 its lifespan is up to 50 years in favourable conditions and its size can get up to 1 2 m placing it among the largest bivalves of the world cabanellas reboredo et al 2019 these fan mussels play a crucial ecological role in their habitat as p nobilis individuals filter water thus retaining a large amount of organic matter from suspended detritus contributing to water clarity trigos et al 2014 furthermore it is a habitat forming species because its shell provides a hard surface within a soft bottom ecosystem which can be colonised by different benthic species augmenting biodiversity cabanellas reboredo et al 2019 in addition at very dense populations the species can function as an ecosystem engineer creating biogenic reefs katsanevakis 2016 despite p nobilis populations have greatly declined due to anthropogenic activities in the 20 th century v√°zquez luis et al 2017 the ongoing mme is the most worrying and widespread threat to p nobilis throughout the mediterranean sea as a consequence the species has been declared as critically endangered iucn 2019 although different aetiological agents have been proposed including mycobacteria and other bacteria carella et al 2019 ≈°ariƒá et al 2020 scarpa et al 2020 there is evidence that the main cause of this mortality is the protozoan haplosporidium pinnae darriba 2017 catanese et al 2018 box et al 2020 a new species that belongs to the genus haplosporidium one of the four genera of the protist order haplosporida where it has been found that other haplosporidian parasites are behind the extensive mortality of several oyster species burreson and ford 2004 arzul and carnegie 2015 life stages include uninucleate and binucleate cells plasmodia and spores a group of experts following up the event predicted a high risk that the disease would be spread by marine currents through the mediterranean basin which could cause the extinction of the species cabanellas reboredo et al 2019 as it is endemic this has helped to better understand the spread of the disease and identified surface currents as the main factor influencing local dispersion whereas environmental factors influence the disease expression which seems to be favoured by temperatures above 13 5 c and a salinity range between 36 5 and 39 7 psu in summary we introduce and study in detail the properties of the mean field version of a general compartmental model to study marine epidemics for bivalve populations namely passive filtering sessile invertebrate hosts infected through waterborne parasites there are two main hypotheses the first one that a population level description i e without the consideration of spatial effects is able to describe well the dynamics of the epidemic when the typical distance between the hosts is smaller than the mixing length of parasites a second assumption is that the host becomes infected with some probability but that there is not a critical parasite load in the infection process after presenting the full sirp model then three different reductions are discussed one exact an approximate reduction of the former and a third reduction based on a timescale approximation the study is closed with a validation with the available experimental data for the infection process of pinna nobilis kept in tanks we wish to point out that being a highly endangered and protected species the reported data correspond to an unintended experiment that cannot be repeated and maybe these data represent the only opportunity to estimate the fundamental parameters of the model in addition the setup in which the pinna nobilis were kept in tanks represent themselves the ideal implementation of the conditions under which the mean field model sirp is valid we believe that the model can be most useful in the rapid characterisation of emergent marine epidemics if the right data from a well mixed system are available 2 the sirp model 2 1 model structure and initial considerations in this work we analyse the sirp model a deterministic multi compartmental mean field model continuous in time and unstructured in spatial or age terms to study infection in bivalve populations in particular we stress that the model as it is written describes spatially homogeneous populations compartmental models are the most frequently used class of models in terrestrial epidemiology diekmann et al 2013 and originated in the classic study of sir models by kermack and mckendrick 1927 the use of compartmental models in the study of infectious processes in marine systems is quite rare until very recently harvell et al 2004 as already advanced in section 1 there are relevant features in the description of epidemic processes in marine ecosystems that are different with respect to the case of terrestrial ecosystems mccallum et al 2004 and their study in marine environments is dominated so far by proliferation models powell and hofmann 2015 which do not address the transmission of the pathogen see bidegain et al 2016b for a discussion of several compartment models for the study of marine epizootics compartmental models of diseases in terrestrial ecosystems caused by microparasites i e viruses bacteria and protozoans do not consider a compartment to describe the dynamics of the parasite may and anderson 1979 describing just the different stages of the host infection typically occurs in 2 ways i as a contact process in which the microparasite is transmitted directly from a an infected host i by contact or through air in close proximity to a susceptible host s ii through a vector that has acquired the microparasite by biting an infected host i and passes the microparasite to a susceptible host s in the first case one can describe the infection process through some probability that the individuals come close while in the second it is very relevant to describe the vector mobility and at least 2 compartments susceptible and infected vector are typically needed once the microparasite enters the host it proliferates inside it so the infection process can be described by using compartments for susceptible individuals s infected individuals i and possible exposed individuals e in particular transmission in terrestrial sessile organisms e g plants is generically vector borne in the case of marine ecosystems infection typically occurs through water borne parasites in particular in filter feeders sessile organisms while vector transmitted diseases are much less frequent parasites may be transported by diffusion sea currents or even active motion i e if they have flagella in any case infection between sessile hosts is not through direct contact but instead through the production and excretion of parasites by infected individuals and the assimilation by filtering of parasites by a healthy susceptible host so parasites are produced and excreted to the marine medium in which they stay infective until they become deactivated i e die or are absorbed by hosts in a way in parasite transmitted marine diseases parasites have a dual role they are not only agents that induce infection but also act as vectors that transmit disease from an immobile infected host to a susceptible one the sirp model is a general mean field compartmental model to describe epidemic transmission through water borne parasites that we think is specially adequate to describe epidemic transmission in passive filter feeders like many bivalves we exclude the case of colonies in which individuals are in close proximity e g mussels corals etc in which direct contact could be relevant and should be included in the model in the sirp model hosts are described through 3 different compartments as in the sir model that represent different evolution stages of the disease a susceptible class of healthy individuals that may contract the disease s an infected class of individuals that may pass the disease through excretion of the parasite i and a class of removed namely dead individuals r that cannot be infected any more and that cannot transmit the disease plus an extra compartment p for the parasite population in the medium it is important to note that invertebrates do not develop long term immunity in the mammalian sense powell and hofmann 2015 and so no compartment of individuals recovered with immunity is considered however bivalves have a first line of defense with hemocytes being able to fight parasites and reduce their internal population nevertheless available evidence indicates that the number of individuals that can achieve a full recovery is usually small and can be neglected instead the population s long term response to disease when it occurs is through natural selection for genotypes characterised by increased resistance to or tolerance for the pathogen as already advanced the sirp model includes a fourth compartment that represents the parasite population in the water medium whose population needs to be described explicitly an explicit compartment allows to model the situation in which the population of parasites may evolve dynamically in time although in section 2 3 3 we will consider the case in which the parasite population accommodates almost instantaneously to the infected host population and the description of the parasite can be simplified infection occurs when the host enters in contact with the parasite in the marine medium it involves a process of filtration of water by the bivalve and although a detailed representation has been discussed in the literature bidegain et al 2016a in the current sirp model it is represented in an effective way infection is modelled through a nonlinear term typical in compartmental models but that now depends on the parasite population and not on the population of the infected compartment i in terrestrial epidemiology there are two alternative ways to represent infection martcheva 2015 i mass action incidence in which infection grows as the population gets larger Œ≤ s i ii standard incidence in which the infection is bounded as the population grows Œ≤ s i n where n is the total host population one must look at these two choices as limit cases with the possibility that in reality the system is best described by an intermediate form closer to one of the limit cases for example the modified sir model in brauer 1990 in which the infection term has s i in the denominator instead of the total population n because the r compartment is removed modelling infection with an explicit representation of the parasite population encounters the same basic dilemma about whether the incidence grows as the host population increases or is bounded we will model infection as Œ≤ s p where the two possibilities are equivalent to the two different incidences just mentioned i Œ≤ Œ≤ ii Œ≤ Œ≤ n where Œ≤ the disease transmission rate is a constant that can depend at most on external parameters like temperature and salinity but not on the variables defining the model populations of host compartments or parasites the model is valid considering both types of incidence and in the case study we will see which incidence seems more adequate in this case 2 2 general sirp model in this section we will write a mean field compartmental model to describe epidemics of immobile sessile hosts in a marine medium through infection by a water borne parasite being a mean field model implies that the model is compartmental and does not include an explicit space dependence and so describes a well mixed system the mean field model describes a spatially homogeneous system but we hope that it will be the basis for spatially inhomogeneous situations by adding suitable terms accounting for the mobility of the parasite it is also assumed that hosts become infected with some probability when exposed to a parasite i e that there is not a critical parasite load needed for infection the model is defined according to the following reaction processes 1 s p Œ≤ i i Œ≥ r i Œª i p p Œº which is graphically summarised in fig 1 according to the scheme in fig 1 we consider the host in 3 possible states susceptible s infected by the parasite i and removed dead r then we introduce the parasite population in the medium water p in the model the disease transmission rate parameter Œ≤ regulates the infection rate of susceptible hosts and accounts among other mechanisms for the parasite intake rate Œ≥ is the mortality of infected hosts being the inverse of the typical mean time for an infected host to die Œª the production rate of parasites from infected hosts and Œº the inverse of the typical life time of the parasite Œº can be related to several processes like biological deactivation or survival time or other general losses like dilution due to renewal of water in a closed experiment natural losses in open ecosystems or absorption by other filter feeders we are not considering the possibility of spontaneous parasite gain i e immigration in this version of the model a summary of the model parameters can be found in table 1 we do not consider vital dynamics for the hosts and this implies that the sum of the 3 host subpopulations is constant n s i r as the time scale of the disease evolution is much faster than the typical life cycle of fan mussels the model is similar to the sip presented in bidegain et al 2016b except for an extra term in p Œ≤ p s accounting for the fact that when a parasite infects a host it is absorbed by the host the conditions under which the sirp model can be simplified to the sip model are discussed in section 3 5 in order to build the deterministic model we consider that the population is large enough to neglect fluctuations and that it is well mixed so that spatial effects can be neglected in this situation we consider the infection process to be proportional to the number of parasites in the medium so that the average number of contacts between susceptible fan mussels and the average parasite population is given by p s and thus the change in the number of susceptible fan mussels takes the form s Œ≤ p s where the dot over a variable indicates a differentiation with respect to time s d s d t following this argumentation the scheme in eq 1 and fig 1 one can write the evolution equations of the sirp model 2 s Œ≤ p s i Œ≤ p s Œ≥ i r Œ≥ i p Œª i Œ≤ p s Œº p model eq 2 lives in the 4 dimensional s i r p phase space representing the variables the populations of individuals in the susceptible infected and removed host compartments and of parasites respectively these variables could be redefined so that s i and r represent proportions of hosts in each compartment and p the population of parasites per host the fixed points of eq 2 are determined by the conditions 1 1 we do not consider the trivial fixed point s i r p 0 that would imply n 0 and p 0 at all time i p 0 to be fulfilled simultaneously we will study the stability of the fixed point defined by s 0 i 0 p 0 0 and r 0 n s 0 a linear stability analysis of this fixed point reveals that it has two null eigenvalues that stem from the condition n s i r and the conserved quantity of appendix a the first condition s i r n implies that it is enough to consider two of the host populations e g s and i as the third one can be obtained from the other two the implications of the conserved quantity reported in appendix a are more subtle as it implies that fixed points are not isolated as it happens in ordinary dissipative dynamical systems and there is an infinite number a line of fixed points for the final state of the epidemic depending on the initial conditions this also implies that the phase space is foliated by the conserved quantity c of eq a 5 and every initial condition s 0 with a different value of c leads to a different asymptotic condition s just as shown in murray 2002 for the sir model cf fig 10 1 in op cit the third eigenvalue that is the largest of the two non zero eigenvalues can be positive if Œ≤ s 0 Œª Œ≥ Œ≤ s 0 Œº and negative if the inequality is reversed defining the conditional stability of the fixed point the fourth eigenvalue is always negative and all the eigenvalues are always real cf appendix b the instability of the fixed point along the third eigenvalue drives the beginning of the epidemic an extremely important result in epidemiology is the so called basic reproduction number r 0 a dimensionless number which represents the number of secondary infections produced by a primary infection in a fully susceptible population r 0 1 defines the threshold for epidemic propagation an epidemic will occur when r 0 1 and the number of infected individuals will grow at an exponential rate in the early phases of the epidemic castro et al 2020 while if r 0 1 the infection will wane naturally this quantity can be formally obtained making use of the next generation matrix ngm method van den driessche and watmough 2008 diekmann et al 2010 applying this formal method to our system of ordinary differential equations ode s one obtains the following relation for the basic reproduction number cf appendix c 3 r 0 Œª Œ≥ 1 Œº Œ≤ s 0 the threshold condition provided by r 0 eq 3 is equivalent to the linear stability condition for the third eigenvalue of the initial pre epidemic fixed point as Œ≤ s 0 Œª Œ≥ Œ≤ s 0 Œº implies that this eigenvalue is positive and the disease free equilibrium state unstable being this equivalent to r 0 1 cf appendix b thus if r 0 1 the fixed point is unstable and an epidemic will ensure if infected hosts i or parasites p appear in the system an epidemic will propagate until the system reaches an stable fixed point that signals the end of the epidemic cf appendix b 2 3 model reduction the sirp model lives in a 4 dimensional phase space and depends on 4 parameters what makes difficult to confront it with experimental data thus we will discuss here three alternative ways of reducing the model the first involves an exact reduction of the model based on the conserved quantity derived in appendix a the second reduction consists of an approximation to the previous exact reduction that turns out to be equivalent to an exact reduction of a slightly simplified model without the Œ≤ s p term in the equation of p the third one is based on an approximation valid if the system parameters fulfil certain conditions 2 3 1 exact reduction of the sirp model from the conserved quantity derived in appendix a it is possible to write the parasite population in the sirp model as a function of the host states as follows 4 p s i Œª Œ≥ s i Œº Œ≤ ln s s c 0 where c 0 p 0 Œª Œ≥ s 0 i 0 Œº Œ≤ ln s 0 s 0 substituting eq 4 into the general sirp model of eq 2 we obtain the following nonstandard sir model 5 s Œª Œ≤ Œ≥ s s i Œº s ln s Œ≤ s 2 s Œ≤ c 0 i Œª Œ≤ Œ≥ s s i Œº s ln s Œ≤ s 2 s Œ≤ c 0 Œ≥ i r Œ≥ i although using the conserved quantity yields an exact reduction from a 4d dynamical system to a 3d one the number of independent parameters and initial conditions remain unchanged i e they still depend on 4 parameters and 3 independent initial conditions thus although useful 5 is not ideal when trying to fit experimental data and this is the reason for trying a further approximation to eq 5 to be discussed next 2 3 2 further approximation to the exact reduction a further approximation to section 2 3 1 that is less restrictive and expected to be valid in a broader parameter range than the time scale approximation presented in section 2 3 3 is possible this approximation reduces the number of free parameters by one what is useful in fitting available data the approximation consists of neglecting the s term in eq 4 what is possible if Œª Œ≥ 1 and also Œº ln n Œ≤ n 1 as s t decreases monotonically with time and is at most n at the initial time interestingly this approximation is equivalent to the simplification of the equation for p in 2 so that the Œ≤ s p is skipped what yields exactly the sip model of ref bidegain et al 2016b this reduced model has an exact conserved quantity c that differs from that of the sirp model in the linear s term cf appendix a using this approximation one can write 6 s Œª Œ≥ s s i Œº s ln s s c 0 i Œª Œ≥ s s i Œº s ln s s c 0 Œ≥ i r Œ≥ i where Œª Œª Œ≤ and c 0 Œ≤ p 0 Œª Œ≥ s 0 i 0 Œº Œ≤ ln s 0 Œ≤ c 0 is a redefinition of the conserved quantity of the sip model eq a 9 c 0 a constant such that it absorbs Œ≤ and all initial conditions of the model the result is that eq 6 depends on 3 parameters and 1 constant compared to eq 5 that depends on 4 parameters facilitating thus the use of the model to fit experimental data 2 3 3 model reduction through fast slow separation the third reduction of the 4 d dynamical model eq 2 makes the assumption that the time scale of the parasite population dynamics is faster than that of the hosts this means that pathogen deactivation in the medium must be faster than host mortality in terms of the rates associated to each of these processes this means Œº Œ≥ taking Œº as common factor in p one can write 7 Œµ p Œª i Œº Œ≤ s p Œº p where Œµ 1 Œº is small as Œº is large if furthermore Œº Œ≤ n and Œª Œ≤ p one arrives to 8 p Œª Œº i under this approximation the slow subsystem can be written 9 s Œ≤ i s i Œ≤ s Œ≥ i r Œ≥ i that is equivalent to the classical sir model with Œ≤ Œ≤ Œª Œº instead of the infection rate Œ≤ the reduced 3 d model eq 9 from the original 4 d sirp model eq 2 depends on 2 parameters instead of 4 as the original model had and 1 initial condition e g i 0 n s 0 if r 0 0 and is much more amenable to be applied to the analysis of experimental data as shown in section 4 furthermore Œ≥ could be eliminated through a time rescaling t t Œ≥ t with a redefinition of Œ≤ Œ≤ Œ≤ Œ≥ Œ≤ Œª Œº Œ≥ leaving the model as a function of a single effective parameter however we will keep both Œ≤ and Œ≥ for convenience when fitting the model to experimental data in section 4 as we would need to know anyhow Œ≥ in order to analyse the experimental data the validity of this approximation is checked numerically in section 3 3 numerical analysis of the model the sirp model cannot be solved analytically so in the present section we perform a numerical characterisation of the model 2 2 all numerical simulations of the dynamical system eq 2 have been carried out using a runge kutta 4 th order method with a temporal step Œ¥ t 0 001 numerically stable results are obtain with Œ¥ t 0 01 moreover we show the validity range of the performed approximations to reduce the sirp model to an effective sir model we start our numerical analysis by investigating the relative influence of the model parameters on some epidemiological quantities of interest the basic reproduction number r 0 related to the existence of an epidemic outbreak continuing with the final state of the epidemic given by the final number of dead individuals r and the maximum of infected individuals i max together with the time at which it occurs t max in order to identify the most influential parameters of our model a sensitivity analysis sa will be performed sa can be divided into two classes local sensitivity analysis lsa and global sensitivity analysis gsa lsa represents the assessment of the local impact of input factors variation on model response by concentrating on the sensitivity in the vicinity of a set of factor values such sensitivity is often evaluated through gradients or partial derivatives of the output functions at these factor values such that other input factors are kept constant since epidemic models exhibit a threshold behaviour controlled by the dimensionless quantity r 0 it is relevant to study its robustness with respect to small perturbations by means of the lsa explained above as its analytical expression is known on the other hand gsa will be applied to study the influence of the parameters in the final state of the epidemic and the epidemic peak by exploring a large domain of the parameter space in turn gsa is the process of apportioning the uncertainty in outputs to the uncertainty in each input factor over their entire range of interest a sensitivity analysis is considered to be global when all the input factors are varied simultaneously and the sensitivity is evaluated over the entire range of each input factor in clear contrast to lsa within gsa first order indices are a measure of the contribution to the output variance given by the variation of the parameter alone averaged over variations in other input parameters while second order indices take into account first order interactions between parameters while lsa is carried out analytically if exact expressions are available gsa is a purely numerical approach further mathematical details on sensitivity analysis can be found in appendix d for all the sensitivity analysis performed in the following sections and in order to avoid ambiguities associated to the definition of Œ≤ as a function of n we assume n 1 so that both possible incidences yield Œ≤ Œ≤ and the numerical results are equivalent 3 1 the basic reproduction number r 0 to study the relevance of parameters involved in an epidemic outbreak a lsa was performed we analyse the local sensitivity of r 0 through the normalised sensitivity index so that the function f p of eq d 1 is substituted by the analytical expression of r 0 eq 3 fig 2 a shows the sensitivity index for r 0 for specific baseline parameters where Œª Œ≤ and s 0 contribute to increase the basic reproduction number while Œ± Œ≥ and Œº contribute to decrease it as expected moreover we can see that Œª and Œ≥ are the most influential parameters while Œº Œ≤ and s 0 depend on each other these dependencies cause varying influences on r 0 which are fully depicted in panels fig 2 b d it can be seen that the influence of Œ≤ increases with the increase of Œº and the decrease of s 0 similarly the importance of s 0 increases with Œº and decreases with Œ≤ on the other hand the impact of Œº increases with the decrease of both s 0 or Œ≤ 3 2 final state of the epidemic another important quantity in epidemiology is the final state of the epidemic which can be characterised by the final number of dead individuals r within our general sirp model it is not possible to find an analytical expression of r t so that we need to tackle the problem numerically to this end we perform gsa for the final number of dead individuals in order to determine the most influential parameters for this quantity in particular we apply the sobol method discussed in appendix d the confidence interval ci obtained in our study is less than 1 of the index value indicating a very high accuracy therefore it is not shown in the figures the results of the explained procedure are shown in fig 3 where the total order black first order white and second order grey sensitivity indices for each of the model parameters are detailed it can be observed that Œº has a slightly greater influence than the other parameters with respect to the final number of dead individuals note that the second order indices are larger than the first order ones for all the parameters which indicates a high influence of the nonlinearities in our model at least for the particular quantity under study 3 3 maximum of infected individuals a gsa of the maximum number of infected individuals i max and the time it occurs t max is performed to study the influence of the model parameters regarding these quantities in this case fig 4 Œ≥ has greater influence in the epidemic peak than any of the other parameters while for the time at which the peak takes place all the parameters have basically the same influence again the second order indices the first order interactions between parameters account for most of parameter sensitivity in particular in the time of the epidemic peak indicating the high degree of nonlinearity of this effect 3 4 numerical verification of the fast slow approximation the parasite concentration approximation based on a timescale separation discussed in section 2 3 3 is now verified by computational means the verification was performed using both mass action and standard incidence but for the sake of simplicity we show only the results for the standard incidence case worth is to say that mathematically changing from standard incidence to mass action involves only a rescaling of the Œ≤ parameter so that the numerical results are invariant fig 5 contains a comparison for 3 different values of the parasite deactivation rate Œº it can be seen that the approximation is poor when Œº Œ≥ Œ≤ n fig 5 a as it could be expected on the other hand the approximation is quite good when Œº is one order of magnitude larger than Œ≥ and Œ≤ n fig 5 b while it is extremely accurate when Œº is two orders of magnitude larger than Œ≥ Œ≤ n fig 5 c the figure also shows the numerical value of p pink dashdot and it can be checked how it becomes smaller as Œº increases compared to Œ≥ Œ≤ n justifying the timescale separation of section 2 3 3 finally fig 5 a c also shows dashed red line the analytical value for p s i derived in eq a 7 that as expected matches perfectly the result of the numerical integration of eq 2 3 5 numerical verification of the model approximation from the exact reduction the numerical verification was performed for both mass action and standard incidence but for the sake of simplicity in fig 6 we show only the results for the standard incidence case first and as it should be because it is an exact result the exact reduction of the sirp model discussed in section 2 3 1 matches perfectly the numerical results obtained from the full model for all possible parameter values fig 6 a c regarding the approximation to the exact reduction one can see how the approximation converges to the exact solution as the parameters fulfil the conditions indicated in section 2 3 2 namely that both Œ≥ Œª 1 and Œº log n Œ≤ n 1 becoming very accurate if these ratios are larger than 1 by two orders of magnitude or more cf fig 6 c we recall that in this case the sirp model converges to the sip model of bidegain et al 2016b conversely the approximation is poor when any of these two ratios is of order 1 cf fig 6 a while fig 6 b presents the result in an intermediate case in which the approximation is fair 4 model validation with data of the pinna nobilis mass mortality event in this section the general sirp model is validated against collected data from the pinna nobilis mass mortality event as explained in section 1 the disease is caused by the parasite haplosporidium pinnae and the hosts p nobilis are sessile bivalves endemic of the mediterranean sea thus this epidemic is a perfect candidate to be described by the sirp model in the model parasite production occurs only inside infected hosts and parasites are released to the medium either through their respiratory or digestive system the simultaneous occurrence of the different possible stages of the parasite uni and bi nucleate cells multinucleate plasmodia sporocysts and uninucleate spores in the same host individual is not common among haplosporidans and makes h pinnae different from previously known haplosporidan species catanese et al 2018 the occurrence of uni and binucleate stages suggest possible direct transmission from infected to healthy fan mussels as observed in b ostreae and b exitiosa hine 1996 culloty and mulcahy 2007 audemard et al 2014 additionally the presence of spores a dormant resistant stage could allow long persistence in the environment and the hypothetical involvement of an intermediate host as suggested for h nelsoni and h costale andrews 1984 haskin and andrews 1988 powell et al 1999 while uninucleate cells are always detected in infected fan mussels sporulation has been only detected sporadically catanese et al 2018 thus we assume that infection occurs mostly through uninucleate or binucleate cells by direct transmission as the experimental observations in captivity point out see garc√≠a march et al 2020 we do not consider disease transmission through other stages we do not consider spores given the infrequent observation of spores and the current lack of experimental information about spore transmission that could involve another intermediate host species regarding plasmodia and sporocyst stages these stages are too large to be released through the epithelium the distinction between uninucleate and binucleate cells seems unnecessary at this level of representation as these phases only participate in parasite proliferation inside infected hosts a process that we consider in an effective way finally the evidence of the time course of the disease compared to the long life cycle of p nobilis suggests host vital dynamics i e recruitment reproduction and natural death can be neglected after an epidemic outbreak that took place in portlligat in the north east of catalonia 215 pinna nobilis individuals were extracted from their natural medium in order to be preserved as a genetic reserve in several controlled water tanks of different institutions in spain garc√≠a march et al 2020 the institutions that participated in this preservation effort were ifapa ieo irta imedmar ucv and oceanogr√†fic of valencia the original idea was to rescue the individuals before infection however the subsequent evolution of the rescued pinna nobilis populations indicates that some individuals were already infected at the time of extraction and or in contact with some amount of the parasite transferred from sea water this allowed the opportunity to use the data of the time evolution of the epidemic in the controlled water tanks reported in garc√≠a march et al 2020 to evaluate the described sirp model 3 3 data used in this work with the purpose of validating and fitting parameters for the sirp model have been taken from the supplementary information of garc√≠a march et al 2020 the empirical data consists of the proportion of survivors as a function of time in the controlled water tanks with a temporal resolution of one month although the temperature of water tanks was controlled it was sharply lowered in most of them when mortality started to appear within the population this was a last effort to keep the rest of the population safe and alive since keeping the temperature below approximately 13 5 c is a known strategy to preserve pinna nobilis individuals as disease expression is minimal cabanellas reboredo et al 2019 fortunately two of the tanks kept its temperature approximately constant during the full recorded time this is the case of the tanks in ifapa in huelva and the oceanogr√†fic of valencia oce both spanish institutes these water tanks have been selected to validate our model maintaining constant temperatures of 14 c and 17 c respectively first we will fit the exact reduction of the sirp model assuming Œº log n Œ≤ n and Œª Œ≥ 1 as discussed in section 2 3 2 namely eq 6 this reduced model depends on three parameters Œª Œº Œ≥ and one constant c 0 cf section 2 3 2 that is related to the initial conditions of the model the order of magnitude of the mortality rate can be deduced from data with an estimate value of Œ≥ 1 month 1 we fix this parameter in order to give some biological information to our model prior to the computational fit we focus on the r compartment as it can be retrieved directly from data in garc√≠a march et al 2020 4 4 the number of dead individuals can be obtained as r n s where s is the population of survivors and n is the total number of individuals in the tanks 50 ifapa and 5 oceanogr√†fic respectively we use a box constrained variant 5 5 we constrain the optimisation because the unconstrained optimisation to the full range of the parameters i e from 0 to is not practical of the well known bfgs optimisation algorithm fletcher 2013 with a common l 2 loss function also known as residual sum of squares rss 6 6 the algorithm is implemented within the julia high level programming language bezanson et al 2017 using the differentialequations jl package rackauckas and nie 2017 by running this algorithm one observes that the optimal parameters tend to be the ones in the boundary of the box constrained parameter space furthermore if the box size is increased or decreased the optimal parameters continue to be in the boundary of the box constrained parameter space this indicates that there exist several parameter combinations that optimally fit the data and the combination parameters found by the optimisation algorithm are only marginally optimal with respect to other parameter values the locus actually a valley of marginal optimal parameters can be seen in the right hand side panels of fig 7 where the cost function value of the optimisation algorithm is plotted as heat map now we reach the point regarding the dilemma between mass action and standard incidence discussed in section 2 1 if one does not correct the Œ≤ parameter with the size of the host population n that is equivalent to assuming the mass action incidence Œ≤ Œ≤ the values that one would obtain for Œ≤ Œ≤ Œª Œº Œª Œº for both populations take disparate values in both tanks Œ≤ 0 046 for the ifapa data set and Œ≤ 0 87 for the oceanogr√†fic oce data set a factor of 19 between them while their temperatures differ only by 3 c these numbers indicate that the standard incidence is more reasonable what amounts to choosing Œ≤ Œ≤ n where the final values of the reported parameter Œ≤ should be multiplied by n 50 for the ifapa tank and n 5 for the oce tank the final result is then Œ≤ 2 28 and Œ≤ 4 36 for ifapa and oce tanks that are the values reported in fig 7 implying that an almost twofold increase of the Œ≤ parameter corresponds to an increase of 3 c this relation is in good agreement with the typical changes in rates of a wide range of organisms with a 3 c change in temperature while a 19 fold change in the rate would imply at least a 30 c change in temperature cf appendix e the fact that there is an infinite number of combinations of the parameters that optimally fit the data suggests that as two parameters are slaved one to each other that the model admits a further reduction this reduction corresponds exactly to the approximate sir model derived in eq 9 with the relationship Œ≤ Œª Œº as anticipated so this gives further corroboration to the use of the sir model eq 9 to fit Œ≤ as the free parameter fixing the value of Œ≥ and with i 0 as the initial condition determined by the fit for consistency with the previous fitting we expect to obtain Œ≤ 2 28 and 4 36 as the optimal parameters for the ifapa and oce water tanks respectively and this is the case interestingly as reduced model eq 9 has fewer parameters to fit we can relax our initial assumption of Œ≥ 1 month 1 and check how the fit improves or worsens when varying Œ≥ in fig 8 a fit of the reduced sir model eq 9 is shown for the ifapa top and oceanogr√†fic bottom controlled water tanks 7 7 the n correction corresponding to standard incidence has already been applied to these values fig 8 c d shows the r s s error as Œ≥ is varied it can be seen that for the ifapa water tanks Œ≥ 1 5 month 1 yields more accurate results while for the oceanogr√†fic water tanks Œ≥ 1 month 1 remains optimum this shows a decrease in the mean removal time 1 Œ≥ for lower water temperatures with the finite size errors inherent to the oce tank as n 5 in the left panels the simulated curve of dead individuals r compartment as a function of time for the optimal fitted parameters is confronted to the experimental data showing a remarkable agreement with the optimum values of Œ≥ in the ifapa tank now with Œ≥ 1 5 month 1 a new value of Œ≤ 3 05 is obtained implying a probably more reasonable ratio of 1 43 for Œ≤ in both tanks it was 1 91 in the original fit from the optimal parameters we obtain the basic reproduction number since r 0 Œ≤ Œ≥ we have that r 0 ifapa 2 and r 0 oce 4 clearly above the epidemic threshold summarising the sirp model is able to fit two sets of experimental data agreeing with a standard incidence according to which the infection rate depends on the amount of parasites per pen shell individual pinna nobilis individuals in the ifapa experiment were actually distributed in 4 tanks and the standard incidence is compatible with this experimental aspect the temperature dependence of the fitted parameters in this range 14 17 c appears to be compatible although experiments at different temperatures would be needed with an arrhenius dependence of the infection parameters also known as boltzmann arrhenius brown et al 2004 moln√°r et al 2017 that can be extended to account for the expect unimodal dependence on temperature with a maximum infectivity at a characteristic temperature for the parasite moln√°r et al 2017 therefore we can assume that global change or temperature shifts is expected to have complex effects on infectious diseases causing some to increase others to decrease and many to shift their distributions rohr and cohen 2020 in the particular case of pen shell mortality our model results suggest the proposed mechanism of lower disease expression at lower temperatures this might have direct consequences for the development of the mortality event and offers a bleak perspective for the future and specifically in the eastern mediterranean basin where the mortality was observed later due to current patterns but average temperatures tend to be higher than in the western part of the mediterranean 5 conclusions in this work we have analysed a compartmental model to study marine epizootics for sessile hosts assuming infection by direct transmission through waterborne parasites moreover we have used data from the recent mass mortality event of pinna nobilis in the mediterranean sea as a case study to validate our model compartmental models are routinely used in the study of disease infection and propagation in terrestrial ecosystems including the study of the current covid 19 pandemic see e g castro et al 2020 however these models are starting to be used only recently in the study of marine epizootics bidegain et al 2016b while proliferation models have been the most popular in the field powell and hofmann 2015 a reason for the low popularity of compartment models in the study of marine epizootics is that there are some aspects in its modelling that differ from the now standard application to terrestrial ecosystems mccallum et al 2004 an important difference is that in principle micro parasites need to be modelled explicitly in marine ecosystems while often they are not included in the description in terrestrial ecosystems may and anderson 1979 the sirp model has 4 compartments and depends on 4 parameters so that it is not quite amenable to theoretical analysis at the same time due to the large number of parameters of the model using it to analyse experimental observations can be cumbersome in practice if the parameter values are unknown nevertheless we have shown three reductions of the model one exact and two approximate ones that can be useful to overcome these limitations that are typically present at the first stages of emergent epidemics indeed the timescale approximation is able to fit the collected data of our case study for some optimal parameters as shown in section 4 this approximation is particularly useful as it only depends on 2 parameters the death rate of infected hosts Œ≥ and an effective infection rate Œ≤ although this approximation simplifies the fitting procedure there is a price to be paid in this analysis the infection parameter Œ≤ and the parameters regulating proliferation Œª and deactivation dilution of the parasite Œº become entrained into a single effective parameter Œ≤ thus the full understanding of the different effects at play in the system requires further work furthermore we have shown that an epidemic model for immobile hosts can be reduced to the standard sir model which assumes direct contact among the hosts i e that the hosts are mobile this reduction is only valid when the time scale of the parasites is much faster than that of the hosts i e Œº Œ≤ n Œ≥ thus our work provides a ground to apply the sir model in marine epidemics of sessile hosts that fulfil the required conditions in a world with many possible new epizootics we believe that our reduced model can be specifically useful to understand key features of those emerging diseases characterised by the spreading of waterborne parasites in a relatively fast way provided that the temporal evolution of the disease can be determined for at least some set of individuals thus some of the key parameters can be fitted to the available experimental data as shown in section 4 still the fitted relevant parameters may need to be supplemented with further information or targeted experiments we hope that this approach can be useful in understanding emerging diseases in shellfish species of economic not only ecological value and also with suitable modifications in aquaculture it is noteworthy that our case study is a haplosporidan waterborne parasite in fact waterborne haplosporidans have been responsible for some of the most significant and consequential marine disease epizootics on record and are considered the major pathogens of concern for aquatic animal health shellfish industries around the world arzul and carnegie 2015 the sirp model is the simplest model that one could think of having in mind its practical application but could be extended to incorporate further effects that are so far described in an effective way credit authorship contribution statement √†lex gim√©nez romero conceptualization methodology formal analysis software writing original draft writing review editing amalia grau

eq a 1 one obtains a 4 p Œª Œ≥ s i s Œº Œ≤ s s as s s d ln s d t all terms in the previous equation are exact differentials with respect to time and the equation can be integrated yielding a 5 p Œª Œ≥

section 2 3 3 where Œº Œ≥ Œ≤ and taking into account the expression for r 0 eq 3 that Œª Œº is most plausible to keep r 0 above the epidemic threshold r 0 1 appendix b stability analysis of the fixed points of the sirp model here we will assume the initial fixed point of our sirp model with i 0 p 0 0 right before the introduction of the infection either through i or p we will assume that r 0 0 so that s 0 n to study the linear stability of the model we need to write the jacobian that takes the form b 1 j Œ≤ p 0 0 Œ≤ s Œ≤ p Œ≥ 0 Œ≤ s 0 Œ≥ 0 0 Œ≤ p Œª 0 Œ≤ s Œº and obtain the eigenvalues for both fixed points where we have already used the standard incidence Œ≤ Œ≤ n from the evidence of the validation with experiments for the pre epidemic fixed point the jacobian becomes b 2 0 0 0 Œ≤ s 0

Œ≤ s 0 from which one can determine that the fixed point is unstable whenever b 4 Œª Œ≤ s 0 Œ≥ Œº Œ≤ s 0 and stable if the inequality is reversed it can be easily shown that eq b 4 is equivalent to r

i p 0 eq b 5 has two roots where s represents the smallest one appendix c calculation of r 0 using the next generation matrix method the so called next generation method ngm is a method to obtain r 0 the basic epidemiological quantity that measures the number of secondary cases produced by a typical infected individual during its entire period of infectiousness in a completely susceptible population it was discussed in appendix b that r 0 is related to the largest non zero eigenvalue say Œª of the fixed point corresponding to the infection free equilibrium an outbreak occurs when Œª 0 or equivalently when r 0 1 and the ngm is an ingenious method to obtain r 0 directly in a reduced linear system in more concrete terms within the ngm method r 0 is the dominant eigenvalue of a suitably defined linear operator a linear matrix in a suitable basis this operator is obtained from a decomposition of the jacobian j of the infected infecting compartments i e excluding susceptible and removed compartments in the form j t œÉ where t is the transmission part that describes the production of new infections and œÉ the transition part that describes changes of state including death then it can be proved diekmann et al 2010 that the basic reproduction number r 0 is given by the spectral radius i e the largest eigenvalue of the next generation matrix k t œÉ 1 in the case of the sirp model the decomposition is applied to the 2 2 jacobian corresponding to the dynamical evolution of the i p infectious compartments being the decomposition j Œ≥ Œ≤ s 0 Œª Œ≤ s 0 Œº t 0 Œ≤ s 0 0 0 œÉ Œ≥ 0 Œª Œ≤ s 0 Œº where the Œ≤ p s term in i is the only one that contributes to the transmission matrix as it is the only process involving infection while all the other terms in the dynamical equations of i and p imply transitions to another compartment like i r or birth and death of p then the next generation matrix is given by k t œÉ 1 Œª Œ≤ s 0 Œ≥ Œ≤ s 0 Œº Œ≤ s 0 Œ≤ s 0 Œº 0 0 r 0 Œª Œ≤ s 0 Œ≥ Œ≤ s 0 Œº this result coincides with the expectation that r 0 should correspond to the number of hosts infected in a single generation by the appearance of an infected host in a completely susceptible population this can be obtained from the number of parasites produced by an infected host Œª times the time in which the infected host is alive producing parasites 1 Œ≥ multiplied by the number of infected hosts produced per parasite Œ≤ s 0 times the time the parasite is alive available to infect 1 Œº Œ≤ s 0 taking into account that parasites are inactivated at a rate Œº and also die when infecting at a rate Œ≤ s 0 where this result assumes that the susceptible population does not change from its initial value s 0 appendix d sensitivity analysis one particular way to analyse the local sensitivity lsa of a given model function f p for each of the parameters that conform it p i is through the normalised sensitivity indexes cariboni et al 2007 d 1 œâ p i f f p i p i f p i p 0 where the partial derivatives in eq d 1 are determined analytically in our case gsa works by studying the influence of a large domain of parameter space in the final state of the epidemic and in the epidemic peak in our case this will be achieved by means of a variance based analysis known as sobol method sobol 2001 this particular method provides information no only on how a particular parameter alone influences the model outputs as happens with lsa but also on the influence of its interactions with other parameters this information is organised in what are known as sobol indices that have been implemented within the julia high level programming language bezanson et al 2017 using the differentialequations jl package rackauckas and nie 2017 and in particular through its subpackage diffeqsensitivity jl this implementation allows the user to sample the parameter space using quasimontecarlo methods and thus obtain confidence intervals ci for the sensitivity indices which are directly related to the committed statistical error the total order indices are a measure of the total variance of the output quantity caused by variations of the input parameter and its interactions first order or main effect indices are a measure of the contribution to the output variance given by the variation of the parameter alone but averaged over variations in other input parameters second order indices take into account first order interactions between parameters further indices can be obtained describing the influence of higher order interactions between parameters but these are not going to be considered more detailed information about sensitivity analysis can be found in saltelli et al 2004 appendix e general rate change with temperature in gillooly et al 2001 the metabolic rate of a wide variety of organisms was studied showing that the change in the metabolic rate with temperature was similar among them in particular the natural logarithm of the metabolic rate linearly depends on the inverse of absolute temperature e 1 log r t a 100 t b and for all the analysed organisms they found that a lies between 5 and 10 and b between 14 and 30 from their analysis we can compute the change in the rate for a given increase of temperature e 2 r t Œ¥ t r t exp a 100 t Œ¥ t b exp a 100 t b exp a 1000 t Œ¥ t Œ¥ t t substituting t 287 k and Œ¥ t 3 k that correspond to our available data cf section 4 in eq e 2 using both the upper and lower limit of a we obtain that the expected increase in the effective transmission rate is between 1 2 to 1 4 this is far from the 19 fold increase that we obtained with the mass action hypothesis in section 4 while it is in good agreement with either the 1 92 ratio we obtained for Œ≤ with the reduction of section 2 3 2 or the 1 43 ratio obtained with the fast slow approximation of section 2 3 3 both obtained using the standard incidence choice fig e 9 a shows the change in the rate with an increase of 3 c for different base temperatures and for all the organisms analysed in gillooly et al 2001 and using their fit note that for all temperatures between 0 c and 30 c the rate change lies between 1 2 and 1 45 fig e 9 b shows the change in the rate for different temperature increases with a base temperature of t 287 k note that in order to obtain a 19 fold increase the temperature change should be at least of 30 c 8 8 a temperature change of 30 c could fall outside the range in which the study of gillooly et al 2001 is valid we just stress that a 19 fold rate change is unlikely for the case of a 3 c that correspond to the 2 data sets that we compare in this section the temperature dependence of metabolic rates has been reported in the context of epidemic parameters coelho and bezerra 2006 shapiro et al 2017 the behaviour of the metabolic rates re analysed here has been also found experimentally in epidemic contexts such as coelho and bezerra 2006 and shapiro et al 2017 i e the increase of the rates with temperature fulfil the ranges shown here 
24552,the state of the art of epidemic modelling in terrestrial ecosystems is the compartmental sir model and its extensions from the now classical work of kermack mackendrick in contrast epidemic modelling of marine ecosystems is a bit behind and compartmental models have been introduced only recently one of the reasons is that many epidemic processes in terrestrial ecosystems can be described through a contact process while modelling marine epidemics is more subtle in many cases here we present a model describing disease outbreaks caused by parasites in bivalve populations the sirp model is a multicompartmental model with four compartments three of which describe the different states of the host susceptible i e healthy s infected i and removed dead r and one compartment for the parasite in the marine medium p written as a 4 dimensional dynamical system even if this is the simplest model one can write to describe this system it is still too complicated for both direct analytical manipulation and direct comparison with experimental observations as it depends on four parameters to be fitted we show that it is possible to simplify the model including a reduction to the standard sir model if the parameters fulfil certain conditions the model is validated with available data for the recent mass mortality event of the noble pen shell pinna nobilis a disease caused by the parasite haplosporidium pinnae showing that the reduced sir model is able to fit the data so we show that a model in which the species that suffers the epidemics host cannot move and contagion occurs through parasites can be reduced to the standard sir model that represents epidemic transmission between mobile hosts the fit indicates that the assumptions made to simplify the model are reasonable in practice although it leads to an indeterminacy in three of the original parameters this opens the possibility of performing direct experiments to be able to solve this question graphical abstract keywords epidemics mathematical model compartmental model bivalve diseases pinna nobilis haplosporidium pinnae 1 introduction marine organisms like their terrestrial counterparts can serve as hosts for a diversity of parasites and pathogens present in the ecosystem which are directly responsible for disease outbreaks disease induced mortality affects not only the host population but can cascade through the whole ecosystem altering its structure and functioning ward and lafferty 2004 furthermore climate change can increase the spread range and impact of parasites and pathogens burge et al 2014 in fact marine infectious diseases are recently increasing due to climate change and other anthropogenic pressures like pollution and overfishing lafferty et al 2004 this in turn threatens many valuable ecologically habitats and can also result in substantial economic losses in e g aquaculture lafferty et al 2015 analysing the impact of these events at appropriate scales spatial and temporal and biological organisation levels species populations and communities is crucial to accurately anticipate future changes in marine ecosystems and propose adapted management and conservation plans pairaud et al 2014 thus there is a strong need to address the mechanism of disease propagation in marine organisms however the state of the art of epidemiological studies in marine ecosystems lags behind that of terrestrial ecosystems harvell et al 2004 contact and vector borne based infectious diseases of terrestrial vertebrates and their epidemiology are typically studied using variations of the classical formulation of kermack and mckendrick kermack and mckendrick 1927 1932 1933 the sir model among other things this formalism allows to understand why epizootics spread and stop as the propagation of a disease is a threshold phenomenon anderson 1991 regulated by the now commonplace r 0 dimensionless number within this framework the initiation of epidemic transmission occurs when an infected individual is in close contact with a susceptible host or through a transmission vector as typically pathogens can only survive for a very limited time outside the host in an aerial environment on the other hand as air is typically a much harsher medium for pathogens than water the sea is expected to host a large number of pathogens viruses bacteria and parasites for a relatively long time the longer life span of pathogens in a water medium together with the increased buoyancy arising from the different physical properties of seawater and air coupled to the existence of marine currents that can transmit pathogens for long distances away allows diseases to spread faster and reach further distances in marine environments compared to epidemics in terrestrial systems cantrell et al 2020 as a result the possible long term transmission of parasites by currents in marine environments make them more prone to suffer from persistent zoonotics compared to terrestrial ecosystems where for an epidemic outbreak to occur the presence of an initial infected host or vector is necessary within a susceptible population until quite recently marine zoonotics were mostly studied using different models compared to terrestrial diseases and it was not even clear whether the same tools could be applied mccallum et al 2004 the abundance of pathogens in marine ecosystems is one of the reasons why proliferation models that do not focus on transmission and assume a widespread occurrence of the pathogen and a rapid transmission problem have been most popular in the field powell and hofmann 2015 in fact compartmental models are starting to be used only recently in the study of marine epizootics bidegain et al 2016b an important subset of marine organisms are sessile e g bivalves which means that they cannot move in the case of sessile terrestrial organisms disease transmission occurs mostly through vectors insects that transmit the pathogens causing the disease instead in marine ecosystems disease transmission is most often waterborne in particular in passive water filtering feeders as is the case of bivalves recently some compartmental models considering the pathogen population have been recently proposed to study particular bivalve epidemics bidegain et al 2016a b 2017 in the present work we analyse a model that is aimed to describe disease transmission from an infected immobile host to a susceptible one of the same species through waterborne parasites that are explicitly described the model is closely related to the sip model introduced in bidegain et al 2016b in this first study we analyse in detail the properties of the mean field version of the model that aims to describe spatially homogeneous i e well mixed populations the well mixed approximation will be valid whenever the mean distance among hosts is smaller than the mixing length of the parasites before they get inactivated or absorbed the model is written such that waterborne transmission is the only mechanism by which one infected immobile host can infect a healthy one and thus does not describe infection through direct contact it is also assumed that the infected hosts as invertebrates do not have immune memory and that the probability that an infected individual recovers is small and can be neglected thus the model is not adequate to study infection of highly aggregated molluscs like some mussels or other passive filters like corals as for these hosts one should also include the possibility of infection through direct contact a very timely case study of such emerging epidemics is the noble fan mussel or pen shell pinna nobilis this fan mussel is the largest endemic bivalve in the mediterranean sea and is under a serious extinction risk due to a mass mortality event mme that has occurred throughout the whole mediterranean basin very recently garc√≠a march et al 2020 zotou et al 2020 v√°zquez luis et al 2017 right before this mme it was distributed across a wide type of habitats including coastal and paralic ecosystems at depths between 0 5 to 60 m butler et al 1993 prado et al 2020 in open coastal waters the distribution of the species is mainly associated with seagrass meadows typically of posidonia oceanica which has been indicated as its optimal habitat hendriks et al 2011 its lifespan is up to 50 years in favourable conditions and its size can get up to 1 2 m placing it among the largest bivalves of the world cabanellas reboredo et al 2019 these fan mussels play a crucial ecological role in their habitat as p nobilis individuals filter water thus retaining a large amount of organic matter from suspended detritus contributing to water clarity trigos et al 2014 furthermore it is a habitat forming species because its shell provides a hard surface within a soft bottom ecosystem which can be colonised by different benthic species augmenting biodiversity cabanellas reboredo et al 2019 in addition at very dense populations the species can function as an ecosystem engineer creating biogenic reefs katsanevakis 2016 despite p nobilis populations have greatly declined due to anthropogenic activities in the 20 th century v√°zquez luis et al 2017 the ongoing mme is the most worrying and widespread threat to p nobilis throughout the mediterranean sea as a consequence the species has been declared as critically endangered iucn 2019 although different aetiological agents have been proposed including mycobacteria and other bacteria carella et al 2019 ≈°ariƒá et al 2020 scarpa et al 2020 there is evidence that the main cause of this mortality is the protozoan haplosporidium pinnae darriba 2017 catanese et al 2018 box et al 2020 a new species that belongs to the genus haplosporidium one of the four genera of the protist order haplosporida where it has been found that other haplosporidian parasites are behind the extensive mortality of several oyster species burreson and ford 2004 arzul and carnegie 2015 life stages include uninucleate and binucleate cells plasmodia and spores a group of experts following up the event predicted a high risk that the disease would be spread by marine currents through the mediterranean basin which could cause the extinction of the species cabanellas reboredo et al 2019 as it is endemic this has helped to better understand the spread of the disease and identified surface currents as the main factor influencing local dispersion whereas environmental factors influence the disease expression which seems to be favoured by temperatures above 13 5 c and a salinity range between 36 5 and 39 7 psu in summary we introduce and study in detail the properties of the mean field version of a general compartmental model to study marine epidemics for bivalve populations namely passive filtering sessile invertebrate hosts infected through waterborne parasites there are two main hypotheses the first one that a population level description i e without the consideration of spatial effects is able to describe well the dynamics of the epidemic when the typical distance between the hosts is smaller than the mixing length of parasites a second assumption is that the host becomes infected with some probability but that there is not a critical parasite load in the infection process after presenting the full sirp model then three different reductions are discussed one exact an approximate reduction of the former and a third reduction based on a timescale approximation the study is closed with a validation with the available experimental data for the infection process of pinna nobilis kept in tanks we wish to point out that being a highly endangered and protected species the reported data correspond to an unintended experiment that cannot be repeated and maybe these data represent the only opportunity to estimate the fundamental parameters of the model in addition the setup in which the pinna nobilis were kept in tanks represent themselves the ideal implementation of the conditions under which the mean field model sirp is valid we believe that the model can be most useful in the rapid characterisation of emergent marine epidemics if the right data from a well mixed system are available 2 the sirp model 2 1 model structure and initial considerations in this work we analyse the sirp model a deterministic multi compartmental mean field model continuous in time and unstructured in spatial or age terms to study infection in bivalve populations in particular we stress that the model as it is written describes spatially homogeneous populations compartmental models are the most frequently used class of models in terrestrial epidemiology diekmann et al 2013 and originated in the classic study of sir models by kermack and mckendrick 1927 the use of compartmental models in the study of infectious processes in marine systems is quite rare until very recently harvell et al 2004 as already advanced in section 1 there are relevant features in the description of epidemic processes in marine ecosystems that are different with respect to the case of terrestrial ecosystems mccallum et al 2004 and their study in marine environments is dominated so far by proliferation models powell and hofmann 2015 which do not address the transmission of the pathogen see bidegain et al 2016b for a discussion of several compartment models for the study of marine epizootics compartmental models of diseases in terrestrial ecosystems caused by microparasites i e viruses bacteria and protozoans do not consider a compartment to describe the dynamics of the parasite may and anderson 1979 describing just the different stages of the host infection typically occurs in 2 ways i as a contact process in which the microparasite is transmitted directly from a an infected host i by contact or through air in close proximity to a susceptible host s ii through a vector that has acquired the microparasite by biting an infected host i and passes the microparasite to a susceptible host s in the first case one can describe the infection process through some probability that the individuals come close while in the second it is very relevant to describe the vector mobility and at least 2 compartments susceptible and infected vector are typically needed once the microparasite enters the host it proliferates inside it so the infection process can be described by using compartments for susceptible individuals s infected individuals i and possible exposed individuals e in particular transmission in terrestrial sessile organisms e g plants is generically vector borne in the case of marine ecosystems infection typically occurs through water borne parasites in particular in filter feeders sessile organisms while vector transmitted diseases are much less frequent parasites may be transported by diffusion sea currents or even active motion i e if they have flagella in any case infection between sessile hosts is not through direct contact but instead through the production and excretion of parasites by infected individuals and the assimilation by filtering of parasites by a healthy susceptible host so parasites are produced and excreted to the marine medium in which they stay infective until they become deactivated i e die or are absorbed by hosts in a way in parasite transmitted marine diseases parasites have a dual role they are not only agents that induce infection but also act as vectors that transmit disease from an immobile infected host to a susceptible one the sirp model is a general mean field compartmental model to describe epidemic transmission through water borne parasites that we think is specially adequate to describe epidemic transmission in passive filter feeders like many bivalves we exclude the case of colonies in which individuals are in close proximity e g mussels corals etc in which direct contact could be relevant and should be included in the model in the sirp model hosts are described through 3 different compartments as in the sir model that represent different evolution stages of the disease a susceptible class of healthy individuals that may contract the disease s an infected class of individuals that may pass the disease through excretion of the parasite i and a class of removed namely dead individuals r that cannot be infected any more and that cannot transmit the disease plus an extra compartment p for the parasite population in the medium it is important to note that invertebrates do not develop long term immunity in the mammalian sense powell and hofmann 2015 and so no compartment of individuals recovered with immunity is considered however bivalves have a first line of defense with hemocytes being able to fight parasites and reduce their internal population nevertheless available evidence indicates that the number of individuals that can achieve a full recovery is usually small and can be neglected instead the population s long term response to disease when it occurs is through natural selection for genotypes characterised by increased resistance to or tolerance for the pathogen as already advanced the sirp model includes a fourth compartment that represents the parasite population in the water medium whose population needs to be described explicitly an explicit compartment allows to model the situation in which the population of parasites may evolve dynamically in time although in section 2 3 3 we will consider the case in which the parasite population accommodates almost instantaneously to the infected host population and the description of the parasite can be simplified infection occurs when the host enters in contact with the parasite in the marine medium it involves a process of filtration of water by the bivalve and although a detailed representation has been discussed in the literature bidegain et al 2016a in the current sirp model it is represented in an effective way infection is modelled through a nonlinear term typical in compartmental models but that now depends on the parasite population and not on the population of the infected compartment i in terrestrial epidemiology there are two alternative ways to represent infection martcheva 2015 i mass action incidence in which infection grows as the population gets larger Œ≤ s i ii standard incidence in which the infection is bounded as the population grows Œ≤ s i n where n is the total host population one must look at these two choices as limit cases with the possibility that in reality the system is best described by an intermediate form closer to one of the limit cases for example the modified sir model in brauer 1990 in which the infection term has s i in the denominator instead of the total population n because the r compartment is removed modelling infection with an explicit representation of the parasite population encounters the same basic dilemma about whether the incidence grows as the host population increases or is bounded we will model infection as Œ≤ s p where the two possibilities are equivalent to the two different incidences just mentioned i Œ≤ Œ≤ ii Œ≤ Œ≤ n where Œ≤ the disease transmission rate is a constant that can depend at most on external parameters like temperature and salinity but not on the variables defining the model populations of host compartments or parasites the model is valid considering both types of incidence and in the case study we will see which incidence seems more adequate in this case 2 2 general sirp model in this section we will write a mean field compartmental model to describe epidemics of immobile sessile hosts in a marine medium through infection by a water borne parasite being a mean field model implies that the model is compartmental and does not include an explicit space dependence and so describes a well mixed system the mean field model describes a spatially homogeneous system but we hope that it will be the basis for spatially inhomogeneous situations by adding suitable terms accounting for the mobility of the parasite it is also assumed that hosts become infected with some probability when exposed to a parasite i e that there is not a critical parasite load needed for infection the model is defined according to the following reaction processes 1 s p Œ≤ i i Œ≥ r i Œª i p p Œº which is graphically summarised in fig 1 according to the scheme in fig 1 we consider the host in 3 possible states susceptible s infected by the parasite i and removed dead r then we introduce the parasite population in the medium water p in the model the disease transmission rate parameter Œ≤ regulates the infection rate of susceptible hosts and accounts among other mechanisms for the parasite intake rate Œ≥ is the mortality of infected hosts being the inverse of the typical mean time for an infected host to die Œª the production rate of parasites from infected hosts and Œº the inverse of the typical life time of the parasite Œº can be related to several processes like biological deactivation or survival time or other general losses like dilution due to renewal of water in a closed experiment natural losses in open ecosystems or absorption by other filter feeders we are not considering the possibility of spontaneous parasite gain i e immigration in this version of the model a summary of the model parameters can be found in table 1 we do not consider vital dynamics for the hosts and this implies that the sum of the 3 host subpopulations is constant n s i r as the time scale of the disease evolution is much faster than the typical life cycle of fan mussels the model is similar to the sip presented in bidegain et al 2016b except for an extra term in p Œ≤ p s accounting for the fact that when a parasite infects a host it is absorbed by the host the conditions under which the sirp model can be simplified to the sip model are discussed in section 3 5 in order to build the deterministic model we consider that the population is large enough to neglect fluctuations and that it is well mixed so that spatial effects can be neglected in this situation we consider the infection process to be proportional to the number of parasites in the medium so that the average number of contacts between susceptible fan mussels and the average parasite population is given by p s and thus the change in the number of susceptible fan mussels takes the form s Œ≤ p s where the dot over a variable indicates a differentiation with respect to time s d s d t following this argumentation the scheme in eq 1 and fig 1 one can write the evolution equations of the sirp model 2 s Œ≤ p s i Œ≤ p s Œ≥ i r Œ≥ i p Œª i Œ≤ p s Œº p model eq 2 lives in the 4 dimensional s i r p phase space representing the variables the populations of individuals in the susceptible infected and removed host compartments and of parasites respectively these variables could be redefined so that s i and r represent proportions of hosts in each compartment and p the population of parasites per host the fixed points of eq 2 are determined by the conditions 1 1 we do not consider the trivial fixed point s i r p 0 that would imply n 0 and p 0 at all time i p 0 to be fulfilled simultaneously we will study the stability of the fixed point defined by s 0 i 0 p 0 0 and r 0 n s 0 a linear stability analysis of this fixed point reveals that it has two null eigenvalues that stem from the condition n s i r and the conserved quantity of appendix a the first condition s i r n implies that it is enough to consider two of the host populations e g s and i as the third one can be obtained from the other two the implications of the conserved quantity reported in appendix a are more subtle as it implies that fixed points are not isolated as it happens in ordinary dissipative dynamical systems and there is an infinite number a line of fixed points for the final state of the epidemic depending on the initial conditions this also implies that the phase space is foliated by the conserved quantity c of eq a 5 and every initial condition s 0 with a different value of c leads to a different asymptotic condition s just as shown in murray 2002 for the sir model cf fig 10 1 in op cit the third eigenvalue that is the largest of the two non zero eigenvalues can be positive if Œ≤ s 0 Œª Œ≥ Œ≤ s 0 Œº and negative if the inequality is reversed defining the conditional stability of the fixed point the fourth eigenvalue is always negative and all the eigenvalues are always real cf appendix b the instability of the fixed point along the third eigenvalue drives the beginning of the epidemic an extremely important result in epidemiology is the so called basic reproduction number r 0 a dimensionless number which represents the number of secondary infections produced by a primary infection in a fully susceptible population r 0 1 defines the threshold for epidemic propagation an epidemic will occur when r 0 1 and the number of infected individuals will grow at an exponential rate in the early phases of the epidemic castro et al 2020 while if r 0 1 the infection will wane naturally this quantity can be formally obtained making use of the next generation matrix ngm method van den driessche and watmough 2008 diekmann et al 2010 applying this formal method to our system of ordinary differential equations ode s one obtains the following relation for the basic reproduction number cf appendix c 3 r 0 Œª Œ≥ 1 Œº Œ≤ s 0 the threshold condition provided by r 0 eq 3 is equivalent to the linear stability condition for the third eigenvalue of the initial pre epidemic fixed point as Œ≤ s 0 Œª Œ≥ Œ≤ s 0 Œº implies that this eigenvalue is positive and the disease free equilibrium state unstable being this equivalent to r 0 1 cf appendix b thus if r 0 1 the fixed point is unstable and an epidemic will ensure if infected hosts i or parasites p appear in the system an epidemic will propagate until the system reaches an stable fixed point that signals the end of the epidemic cf appendix b 2 3 model reduction the sirp model lives in a 4 dimensional phase space and depends on 4 parameters what makes difficult to confront it with experimental data thus we will discuss here three alternative ways of reducing the model the first involves an exact reduction of the model based on the conserved quantity derived in appendix a the second reduction consists of an approximation to the previous exact reduction that turns out to be equivalent to an exact reduction of a slightly simplified model without the Œ≤ s p term in the equation of p the third one is based on an approximation valid if the system parameters fulfil certain conditions 2 3 1 exact reduction of the sirp model from the conserved quantity derived in appendix a it is possible to write the parasite population in the sirp model as a function of the host states as follows 4 p s i Œª Œ≥ s i Œº Œ≤ ln s s c 0 where c 0 p 0 Œª Œ≥ s 0 i 0 Œº Œ≤ ln s 0 s 0 substituting eq 4 into the general sirp model of eq 2 we obtain the following nonstandard sir model 5 s Œª Œ≤ Œ≥ s s i Œº s ln s Œ≤ s 2 s Œ≤ c 0 i Œª Œ≤ Œ≥ s s i Œº s ln s Œ≤ s 2 s Œ≤ c 0 Œ≥ i r Œ≥ i although using the conserved quantity yields an exact reduction from a 4d dynamical system to a 3d one the number of independent parameters and initial conditions remain unchanged i e they still depend on 4 parameters and 3 independent initial conditions thus although useful 5 is not ideal when trying to fit experimental data and this is the reason for trying a further approximation to eq 5 to be discussed next 2 3 2 further approximation to the exact reduction a further approximation to section 2 3 1 that is less restrictive and expected to be valid in a broader parameter range than the time scale approximation presented in section 2 3 3 is possible this approximation reduces the number of free parameters by one what is useful in fitting available data the approximation consists of neglecting the s term in eq 4 what is possible if Œª Œ≥ 1 and also Œº ln n Œ≤ n 1 as s t decreases monotonically with time and is at most n at the initial time interestingly this approximation is equivalent to the simplification of the equation for p in 2 so that the Œ≤ s p is skipped what yields exactly the sip model of ref bidegain et al 2016b this reduced model has an exact conserved quantity c that differs from that of the sirp model in the linear s term cf appendix a using this approximation one can write 6 s Œª Œ≥ s s i Œº s ln s s c 0 i Œª Œ≥ s s i Œº s ln s s c 0 Œ≥ i r Œ≥ i where Œª Œª Œ≤ and c 0 Œ≤ p 0 Œª Œ≥ s 0 i 0 Œº Œ≤ ln s 0 Œ≤ c 0 is a redefinition of the conserved quantity of the sip model eq a 9 c 0 a constant such that it absorbs Œ≤ and all initial conditions of the model the result is that eq 6 depends on 3 parameters and 1 constant compared to eq 5 that depends on 4 parameters facilitating thus the use of the model to fit experimental data 2 3 3 model reduction through fast slow separation the third reduction of the 4 d dynamical model eq 2 makes the assumption that the time scale of the parasite population dynamics is faster than that of the hosts this means that pathogen deactivation in the medium must be faster than host mortality in terms of the rates associated to each of these processes this means Œº Œ≥ taking Œº as common factor in p one can write 7 Œµ p Œª i Œº Œ≤ s p Œº p where Œµ 1 Œº is small as Œº is large if furthermore Œº Œ≤ n and Œª Œ≤ p one arrives to 8 p Œª Œº i under this approximation the slow subsystem can be written 9 s Œ≤ i s i Œ≤ s Œ≥ i r Œ≥ i that is equivalent to the classical sir model with Œ≤ Œ≤ Œª Œº instead of the infection rate Œ≤ the reduced 3 d model eq 9 from the original 4 d sirp model eq 2 depends on 2 parameters instead of 4 as the original model had and 1 initial condition e g i 0 n s 0 if r 0 0 and is much more amenable to be applied to the analysis of experimental data as shown in section 4 furthermore Œ≥ could be eliminated through a time rescaling t t Œ≥ t with a redefinition of Œ≤ Œ≤ Œ≤ Œ≥ Œ≤ Œª Œº Œ≥ leaving the model as a function of a single effective parameter however we will keep both Œ≤ and Œ≥ for convenience when fitting the model to experimental data in section 4 as we would need to know anyhow Œ≥ in order to analyse the experimental data the validity of this approximation is checked numerically in section 3 3 numerical analysis of the model the sirp model cannot be solved analytically so in the present section we perform a numerical characterisation of the model 2 2 all numerical simulations of the dynamical system eq 2 have been carried out using a runge kutta 4 th order method with a temporal step Œ¥ t 0 001 numerically stable results are obtain with Œ¥ t 0 01 moreover we show the validity range of the performed approximations to reduce the sirp model to an effective sir model we start our numerical analysis by investigating the relative influence of the model parameters on some epidemiological quantities of interest the basic reproduction number r 0 related to the existence of an epidemic outbreak continuing with the final state of the epidemic given by the final number of dead individuals r and the maximum of infected individuals i max together with the time at which it occurs t max in order to identify the most influential parameters of our model a sensitivity analysis sa will be performed sa can be divided into two classes local sensitivity analysis lsa and global sensitivity analysis gsa lsa represents the assessment of the local impact of input factors variation on model response by concentrating on the sensitivity in the vicinity of a set of factor values such sensitivity is often evaluated through gradients or partial derivatives of the output functions at these factor values such that other input factors are kept constant since epidemic models exhibit a threshold behaviour controlled by the dimensionless quantity r 0 it is relevant to study its robustness with respect to small perturbations by means of the lsa explained above as its analytical expression is known on the other hand gsa will be applied to study the influence of the parameters in the final state of the epidemic and the epidemic peak by exploring a large domain of the parameter space in turn gsa is the process of apportioning the uncertainty in outputs to the uncertainty in each input factor over their entire range of interest a sensitivity analysis is considered to be global when all the input factors are varied simultaneously and the sensitivity is evaluated over the entire range of each input factor in clear contrast to lsa within gsa first order indices are a measure of the contribution to the output variance given by the variation of the parameter alone averaged over variations in other input parameters while second order indices take into account first order interactions between parameters while lsa is carried out analytically if exact expressions are available gsa is a purely numerical approach further mathematical details on sensitivity analysis can be found in appendix d for all the sensitivity analysis performed in the following sections and in order to avoid ambiguities associated to the definition of Œ≤ as a function of n we assume n 1 so that both possible incidences yield Œ≤ Œ≤ and the numerical results are equivalent 3 1 the basic reproduction number r 0 to study the relevance of parameters involved in an epidemic outbreak a lsa was performed we analyse the local sensitivity of r 0 through the normalised sensitivity index so that the function f p of eq d 1 is substituted by the analytical expression of r 0 eq 3 fig 2 a shows the sensitivity index for r 0 for specific baseline parameters where Œª Œ≤ and s 0 contribute to increase the basic reproduction number while Œ± Œ≥ and Œº contribute to decrease it as expected moreover we can see that Œª and Œ≥ are the most influential parameters while Œº Œ≤ and s 0 depend on each other these dependencies cause varying influences on r 0 which are fully depicted in panels fig 2 b d it can be seen that the influence of Œ≤ increases with the increase of Œº and the decrease of s 0 similarly the importance of s 0 increases with Œº and decreases with Œ≤ on the other hand the impact of Œº increases with the decrease of both s 0 or Œ≤ 3 2 final state of the epidemic another important quantity in epidemiology is the final state of the epidemic which can be characterised by the final number of dead individuals r within our general sirp model it is not possible to find an analytical expression of r t so that we need to tackle the problem numerically to this end we perform gsa for the final number of dead individuals in order to determine the most influential parameters for this quantity in particular we apply the sobol method discussed in appendix d the confidence interval ci obtained in our study is less than 1 of the index value indicating a very high accuracy therefore it is not shown in the figures the results of the explained procedure are shown in fig 3 where the total order black first order white and second order grey sensitivity indices for each of the model parameters are detailed it can be observed that Œº has a slightly greater influence than the other parameters with respect to the final number of dead individuals note that the second order indices are larger than the first order ones for all the parameters which indicates a high influence of the nonlinearities in our model at least for the particular quantity under study 3 3 maximum of infected individuals a gsa of the maximum number of infected individuals i max and the time it occurs t max is performed to study the influence of the model parameters regarding these quantities in this case fig 4 Œ≥ has greater influence in the epidemic peak than any of the other parameters while for the time at which the peak takes place all the parameters have basically the same influence again the second order indices the first order interactions between parameters account for most of parameter sensitivity in particular in the time of the epidemic peak indicating the high degree of nonlinearity of this effect 3 4 numerical verification of the fast slow approximation the parasite concentration approximation based on a timescale separation discussed in section 2 3 3 is now verified by computational means the verification was performed using both mass action and standard incidence but for the sake of simplicity we show only the results for the standard incidence case worth is to say that mathematically changing from standard incidence to mass action involves only a rescaling of the Œ≤ parameter so that the numerical results are invariant fig 5 contains a comparison for 3 different values of the parasite deactivation rate Œº it can be seen that the approximation is poor when Œº Œ≥ Œ≤ n fig 5 a as it could be expected on the other hand the approximation is quite good when Œº is one order of magnitude larger than Œ≥ and Œ≤ n fig 5 b while it is extremely accurate when Œº is two orders of magnitude larger than Œ≥ Œ≤ n fig 5 c the figure also shows the numerical value of p pink dashdot and it can be checked how it becomes smaller as Œº increases compared to Œ≥ Œ≤ n justifying the timescale separation of section 2 3 3 finally fig 5 a c also shows dashed red line the analytical value for p s i derived in eq a 7 that as expected matches perfectly the result of the numerical integration of eq 2 3 5 numerical verification of the model approximation from the exact reduction the numerical verification was performed for both mass action and standard incidence but for the sake of simplicity in fig 6 we show only the results for the standard incidence case first and as it should be because it is an exact result the exact reduction of the sirp model discussed in section 2 3 1 matches perfectly the numerical results obtained from the full model for all possible parameter values fig 6 a c regarding the approximation to the exact reduction one can see how the approximation converges to the exact solution as the parameters fulfil the conditions indicated in section 2 3 2 namely that both Œ≥ Œª 1 and Œº log n Œ≤ n 1 becoming very accurate if these ratios are larger than 1 by two orders of magnitude or more cf fig 6 c we recall that in this case the sirp model converges to the sip model of bidegain et al 2016b conversely the approximation is poor when any of these two ratios is of order 1 cf fig 6 a while fig 6 b presents the result in an intermediate case in which the approximation is fair 4 model validation with data of the pinna nobilis mass mortality event in this section the general sirp model is validated against collected data from the pinna nobilis mass mortality event as explained in section 1 the disease is caused by the parasite haplosporidium pinnae and the hosts p nobilis are sessile bivalves endemic of the mediterranean sea thus this epidemic is a perfect candidate to be described by the sirp model in the model parasite production occurs only inside infected hosts and parasites are released to the medium either through their respiratory or digestive system the simultaneous occurrence of the different possible stages of the parasite uni and bi nucleate cells multinucleate plasmodia sporocysts and uninucleate spores in the same host individual is not common among haplosporidans and makes h pinnae different from previously known haplosporidan species catanese et al 2018 the occurrence of uni and binucleate stages suggest possible direct transmission from infected to healthy fan mussels as observed in b ostreae and b exitiosa hine 1996 culloty and mulcahy 2007 audemard et al 2014 additionally the presence of spores a dormant resistant stage could allow long persistence in the environment and the hypothetical involvement of an intermediate host as suggested for h nelsoni and h costale andrews 1984 haskin and andrews 1988 powell et al 1999 while uninucleate cells are always detected in infected fan mussels sporulation has been only detected sporadically catanese et al 2018 thus we assume that infection occurs mostly through uninucleate or binucleate cells by direct transmission as the experimental observations in captivity point out see garc√≠a march et al 2020 we do not consider disease transmission through other stages we do not consider spores given the infrequent observation of spores and the current lack of experimental information about spore transmission that could involve another intermediate host species regarding plasmodia and sporocyst stages these stages are too large to be released through the epithelium the distinction between uninucleate and binucleate cells seems unnecessary at this level of representation as these phases only participate in parasite proliferation inside infected hosts a process that we consider in an effective way finally the evidence of the time course of the disease compared to the long life cycle of p nobilis suggests host vital dynamics i e recruitment reproduction and natural death can be neglected after an epidemic outbreak that took place in portlligat in the north east of catalonia 215 pinna nobilis individuals were extracted from their natural medium in order to be preserved as a genetic reserve in several controlled water tanks of different institutions in spain garc√≠a march et al 2020 the institutions that participated in this preservation effort were ifapa ieo irta imedmar ucv and oceanogr√†fic of valencia the original idea was to rescue the individuals before infection however the subsequent evolution of the rescued pinna nobilis populations indicates that some individuals were already infected at the time of extraction and or in contact with some amount of the parasite transferred from sea water this allowed the opportunity to use the data of the time evolution of the epidemic in the controlled water tanks reported in garc√≠a march et al 2020 to evaluate the described sirp model 3 3 data used in this work with the purpose of validating and fitting parameters for the sirp model have been taken from the supplementary information of garc√≠a march et al 2020 the empirical data consists of the proportion of survivors as a function of time in the controlled water tanks with a temporal resolution of one month although the temperature of water tanks was controlled it was sharply lowered in most of them when mortality started to appear within the population this was a last effort to keep the rest of the population safe and alive since keeping the temperature below approximately 13 5 c is a known strategy to preserve pinna nobilis individuals as disease expression is minimal cabanellas reboredo et al 2019 fortunately two of the tanks kept its temperature approximately constant during the full recorded time this is the case of the tanks in ifapa in huelva and the oceanogr√†fic of valencia oce both spanish institutes these water tanks have been selected to validate our model maintaining constant temperatures of 14 c and 17 c respectively first we will fit the exact reduction of the sirp model assuming Œº log n Œ≤ n and Œª Œ≥ 1 as discussed in section 2 3 2 namely eq 6 this reduced model depends on three parameters Œª Œº Œ≥ and one constant c 0 cf section 2 3 2 that is related to the initial conditions of the model the order of magnitude of the mortality rate can be deduced from data with an estimate value of Œ≥ 1 month 1 we fix this parameter in order to give some biological information to our model prior to the computational fit we focus on the r compartment as it can be retrieved directly from data in garc√≠a march et al 2020 4 4 the number of dead individuals can be obtained as r n s where s is the population of survivors and n is the total number of individuals in the tanks 50 ifapa and 5 oceanogr√†fic respectively we use a box constrained variant 5 5 we constrain the optimisation because the unconstrained optimisation to the full range of the parameters i e from 0 to is not practical of the well known bfgs optimisation algorithm fletcher 2013 with a common l 2 loss function also known as residual sum of squares rss 6 6 the algorithm is implemented within the julia high level programming language bezanson et al 2017 using the differentialequations jl package rackauckas and nie 2017 by running this algorithm one observes that the optimal parameters tend to be the ones in the boundary of the box constrained parameter space furthermore if the box size is increased or decreased the optimal parameters continue to be in the boundary of the box constrained parameter space this indicates that there exist several parameter combinations that optimally fit the data and the combination parameters found by the optimisation algorithm are only marginally optimal with respect to other parameter values the locus actually a valley of marginal optimal parameters can be seen in the right hand side panels of fig 7 where the cost function value of the optimisation algorithm is plotted as heat map now we reach the point regarding the dilemma between mass action and standard incidence discussed in section 2 1 if one does not correct the Œ≤ parameter with the size of the host population n that is equivalent to assuming the mass action incidence Œ≤ Œ≤ the values that one would obtain for Œ≤ Œ≤ Œª Œº Œª Œº for both populations take disparate values in both tanks Œ≤ 0 046 for the ifapa data set and Œ≤ 0 87 for the oceanogr√†fic oce data set a factor of 19 between them while their temperatures differ only by 3 c these numbers indicate that the standard incidence is more reasonable what amounts to choosing Œ≤ Œ≤ n where the final values of the reported parameter Œ≤ should be multiplied by n 50 for the ifapa tank and n 5 for the oce tank the final result is then Œ≤ 2 28 and Œ≤ 4 36 for ifapa and oce tanks that are the values reported in fig 7 implying that an almost twofold increase of the Œ≤ parameter corresponds to an increase of 3 c this relation is in good agreement with the typical changes in rates of a wide range of organisms with a 3 c change in temperature while a 19 fold change in the rate would imply at least a 30 c change in temperature cf appendix e the fact that there is an infinite number of combinations of the parameters that optimally fit the data suggests that as two parameters are slaved one to each other that the model admits a further reduction this reduction corresponds exactly to the approximate sir model derived in eq 9 with the relationship Œ≤ Œª Œº as anticipated so this gives further corroboration to the use of the sir model eq 9 to fit Œ≤ as the free parameter fixing the value of Œ≥ and with i 0 as the initial condition determined by the fit for consistency with the previous fitting we expect to obtain Œ≤ 2 28 and 4 36 as the optimal parameters for the ifapa and oce water tanks respectively and this is the case interestingly as reduced model eq 9 has fewer parameters to fit we can relax our initial assumption of Œ≥ 1 month 1 and check how the fit improves or worsens when varying Œ≥ in fig 8 a fit of the reduced sir model eq 9 is shown for the ifapa top and oceanogr√†fic bottom controlled water tanks 7 7 the n correction corresponding to standard incidence has already been applied to these values fig 8 c d shows the r s s error as Œ≥ is varied it can be seen that for the ifapa water tanks Œ≥ 1 5 month 1 yields more accurate results while for the oceanogr√†fic water tanks Œ≥ 1 month 1 remains optimum this shows a decrease in the mean removal time 1 Œ≥ for lower water temperatures with the finite size errors inherent to the oce tank as n 5 in the left panels the simulated curve of dead individuals r compartment as a function of time for the optimal fitted parameters is confronted to the experimental data showing a remarkable agreement with the optimum values of Œ≥ in the ifapa tank now with Œ≥ 1 5 month 1 a new value of Œ≤ 3 05 is obtained implying a probably more reasonable ratio of 1 43 for Œ≤ in both tanks it was 1 91 in the original fit from the optimal parameters we obtain the basic reproduction number since r 0 Œ≤ Œ≥ we have that r 0 ifapa 2 and r 0 oce 4 clearly above the epidemic threshold summarising the sirp model is able to fit two sets of experimental data agreeing with a standard incidence according to which the infection rate depends on the amount of parasites per pen shell individual pinna nobilis individuals in the ifapa experiment were actually distributed in 4 tanks and the standard incidence is compatible with this experimental aspect the temperature dependence of the fitted parameters in this range 14 17 c appears to be compatible although experiments at different temperatures would be needed with an arrhenius dependence of the infection parameters also known as boltzmann arrhenius brown et al 2004 moln√°r et al 2017 that can be extended to account for the expect unimodal dependence on temperature with a maximum infectivity at a characteristic temperature for the parasite moln√°r et al 2017 therefore we can assume that global change or temperature shifts is expected to have complex effects on infectious diseases causing some to increase others to decrease and many to shift their distributions rohr and cohen 2020 in the particular case of pen shell mortality our model results suggest the proposed mechanism of lower disease expression at lower temperatures this might have direct consequences for the development of the mortality event and offers a bleak perspective for the future and specifically in the eastern mediterranean basin where the mortality was observed later due to current patterns but average temperatures tend to be higher than in the western part of the mediterranean 5 conclusions in this work we have analysed a compartmental model to study marine epizootics for sessile hosts assuming infection by direct transmission through waterborne parasites moreover we have used data from the recent mass mortality event of pinna nobilis in the mediterranean sea as a case study to validate our model compartmental models are routinely used in the study of disease infection and propagation in terrestrial ecosystems including the study of the current covid 19 pandemic see e g castro et al 2020 however these models are starting to be used only recently in the study of marine epizootics bidegain et al 2016b while proliferation models have been the most popular in the field powell and hofmann 2015 a reason for the low popularity of compartment models in the study of marine epizootics is that there are some aspects in its modelling that differ from the now standard application to terrestrial ecosystems mccallum et al 2004 an important difference is that in principle micro parasites need to be modelled explicitly in marine ecosystems while often they are not included in the description in terrestrial ecosystems may and anderson 1979 the sirp model has 4 compartments and depends on 4 parameters so that it is not quite amenable to theoretical analysis at the same time due to the large number of parameters of the model using it to analyse experimental observations can be cumbersome in practice if the parameter values are unknown nevertheless we have shown three reductions of the model one exact and two approximate ones that can be useful to overcome these limitations that are typically present at the first stages of emergent epidemics indeed the timescale approximation is able to fit the collected data of our case study for some optimal parameters as shown in section 4 this approximation is particularly useful as it only depends on 2 parameters the death rate of infected hosts Œ≥ and an effective infection rate Œ≤ although this approximation simplifies the fitting procedure there is a price to be paid in this analysis the infection parameter Œ≤ and the parameters regulating proliferation Œª and deactivation dilution of the parasite Œº become entrained into a single effective parameter Œ≤ thus the full understanding of the different effects at play in the system requires further work furthermore we have shown that an epidemic model for immobile hosts can be reduced to the standard sir model which assumes direct contact among the hosts i e that the hosts are mobile this reduction is only valid when the time scale of the parasites is much faster than that of the hosts i e Œº Œ≤ n Œ≥ thus our work provides a ground to apply the sir model in marine epidemics of sessile hosts that fulfil the required conditions in a world with many possible new epizootics we believe that our reduced model can be specifically useful to understand key features of those emerging diseases characterised by the spreading of waterborne parasites in a relatively fast way provided that the temporal evolution of the disease can be determined for at least some set of individuals thus some of the key parameters can be fitted to the available experimental data as shown in section 4 still the fitted relevant parameters may need to be supplemented with further information or targeted experiments we hope that this approach can be useful in understanding emerging diseases in shellfish species of economic not only ecological value and also with suitable modifications in aquaculture it is noteworthy that our case study is a haplosporidan waterborne parasite in fact waterborne haplosporidans have been responsible for some of the most significant and consequential marine disease epizootics on record and are considered the major pathogens of concern for aquatic animal health shellfish industries around the world arzul and carnegie 2015 the sirp model is the simplest model that one could think of having in mind its practical application but could be extended to incorporate further effects that are so far described in an effective way credit authorship contribution statement √†lex gim√©nez romero conceptualization methodology formal analysis software writing original draft writing review editing amalia grau

eq a 1 one obtains a 4 p Œª Œ≥ s i s Œº Œ≤ s s as s s d ln s d t all terms in the previous equation are exact differentials with respect to time and the equation can be integrated yielding a 5 p Œª Œ≥ s i s Œº Œ≤ ln s c with the integration constant c that is a conserved quantity i e it takes the same value at one time of the dynamical evolution of the system c is related to the initial conditions by a 6 c p 0 Œª Œ≥ s 0 i 0 Œº Œ≤ ln s 0 s 0 p 0 Œª Œ≥ n r 0 Œº Œ≤ ln s 0 s 0 it is possible to use eqs a 5 a 6 to express one of variables as a function of the others for example the parasite

alternative form a 11 Œ≥ Œª p 1 Œ≥ Œª s i Œº Œ≥ Œª Œ≤ ln s c it can be seen that if Œª Œ≥ eq a 11 reduces to eq a 10 remembering that in eq 9 Œ≤ Œª Œ≤ Œº the assumptions used to arrive to eq a 10 in section 2 3 3 where Œº Œ≥ Œ≤ and taking into account the expression for r 0 eq 3 that Œª Œº is most plausible to keep r 0 above the epidemic threshold r 0 1 appendix b stability analysis of the fixed points of the sirp model here we will assume the initial fixed point of our sirp model with i 0 p 0 0 right before the introduction of the infection either through i or p we will assume that r 0 0 so that s 0 n to study the linear stability of the model we need to write the jacobian that takes the form b 1 j Œ≤ p 0 0 Œ≤ s Œ≤ p Œ≥ 0 Œ≤ s 0 Œ≥ 0 0 Œ≤ p Œª 0 Œ≤ s Œº and obtain the eigenvalues for both fixed points where we have already used the standard incidence Œ≤ Œ≤ n from the evidence of the validation with experiments for the pre epidemic fixed point the jacobian becomes b 2 0 0 0 Œ≤ s 0 0 Œ≥ 0 Œ≤ s 0 0 Œ≥ 0 0 0 Œª 0 Œ≤ s 0 Œº matrix eq b 2 has two null 0 eigenvalues and a pair of eigenvalues given by b 3 Œª 1 2 1 2 Œ≥ Œº Œ≤ s 0 Œ≥ 2 Œº 2 Œ≤ s 0 2 2 Œº Œ≤ s 0 2 Œ≥ Œº 2 Œ≥ Œ≤ s 0 4 Œª Œ≤ s 0 from which one can determine that the fixed point is unstable whenever b 4 Œª Œ≤ s 0 Œ≥ Œº Œ≤ s 0 and stable if the inequality is reversed it can be easily shown that eq b 4 is equivalent to r 0 1 with r 0 given by eq 3 the final point of the epidemic s can be found by solving the transcendental equation b 5 Œª Œ≥ 1 s Œº Œ≤ ln s c where c is determined from the initial conditions eq a 6 and i p 0 eq b 5 has two roots where s represents the smallest one appendix c calculation of r 0 using the next generation matrix method the so called next generation method ngm is a method to obtain r 0 the basic epidemiological quantity that measures the number of secondary cases produced by a typical infected individual during its entire period of infectiousness in a completely susceptible population it was discussed in appendix b that r 0 is related to the largest non zero eigenvalue say Œª of the fixed point corresponding to the infection free equilibrium an outbreak occurs when Œª 0 or equivalently when r 0 1 and the ngm is an ingenious method to obtain r 0 directly in a reduced linear system in more concrete terms within the ngm method r 0 is the dominant eigenvalue of a suitably defined linear operator a linear matrix in a suitable basis this operator is obtained from a decomposition of the jacobian j of the infected infecting compartments i e excluding susceptible and removed compartments in the form j t œÉ where t is the transmission part that describes the production of new infections and œÉ the transition part that describes changes of state including death then it can be proved diekmann et al 2010 that the basic reproduction number r 0 is given by the spectral radius i e the largest eigenvalue of the next generation matrix k t œÉ 1 in the case of the sirp model the decomposition is applied to the 2 2 jacobian corresponding to the dynamical evolution of the i p infectious compartments being the decomposition j Œ≥ Œ≤ s 0 Œª Œ≤ s 0 Œº t 0 Œ≤ s 0 0 0 œÉ Œ≥ 0 Œª Œ≤ s 0 Œº where the Œ≤ p s term in i is the only one that contributes to the transmission matrix as it is the only process involving infection while all the other terms in the dynamical equations of i and p imply transitions to another compartment like i r or birth and death of p then the next generation matrix is given by k t œÉ 1 Œª Œ≤ s 0 Œ≥ Œ≤ s 0 Œº Œ≤ s 0 Œ≤ s 0 Œº 0 0 r 0 Œª Œ≤ s 0 Œ≥ Œ≤ s 0 Œº this result coincides with the expectation that r 0 should correspond to the number of hosts infected in a single generation by the appearance of an infected host in a completely susceptible population this can be obtained from the number of parasites produced by an infected host Œª times the time in which the infected host is alive producing parasites 1 Œ≥ multiplied by the number of infected hosts produced per parasite Œ≤ s 0 times the time the parasite is alive available to infect 1 Œº Œ≤ s 0 taking into account that parasites are inactivated at a rate Œº and also die when infecting at a rate Œ≤ s 0 where this result assumes that the susceptible population does not change from its initial value s 0 appendix d sensitivity analysis one particular way to analyse the local sensitivity lsa of a given model function f p for each of the parameters that conform it p i is through the normalised sensitivity indexes cariboni et al 2007 d 1 œâ p i f f p i p i f p i p 0 where the partial derivatives in eq d 1 are determined analytically in our case gsa works by studying the influence of a large domain of parameter space in the final state of the epidemic and in the epidemic peak in our case this will be achieved by means of a variance based analysis known as sobol method sobol 2001 this particular method provides information no only on how a particular parameter alone influences the model outputs as happens with lsa but also on the influence of its interactions with other parameters this information is organised in what are known as sobol indices that have been implemented within the julia high level programming language bezanson et al 2017 using the differentialequations jl package rackauckas and nie 2017 and in particular through its subpackage diffeqsensitivity jl this implementation allows the user to sample the parameter space using quasimontecarlo methods and thus obtain confidence intervals ci for the sensitivity indices which are directly related to the committed statistical error the total order indices are a measure of the total variance of the output quantity caused by variations of the input parameter and its interactions first order or main effect indices are a measure of the contribution to the output variance given by the variation of the parameter alone but averaged over variations in other input parameters second order indices take into account first order interactions between parameters further indices can be obtained describing the influence of higher order interactions between parameters but these are not going to be considered more detailed information about sensitivity analysis can be found in saltelli et al 2004 appendix e general rate change with temperature in gillooly et al 2001 the metabolic rate of a wide variety of organisms was studied showing that the change in the metabolic rate with temperature was similar among them in particular the natural logarithm of the metabolic rate linearly depends on the inverse of absolute temperature e 1 log r t a 100 t b and for all the analysed organisms they found that a lies between 5 and 10 and b between 14 and 30 from their analysis we can compute the change in the rate for a given increase of temperature e 2 r t Œ¥ t r t exp a 100 t Œ¥ t b exp a 100 t b exp a 1000 t Œ¥ t Œ¥ t t substituting t 287 k and Œ¥ t 3 k that correspond to our available data cf section 4 in eq e 2 using both the upper and lower limit of a we obtain that the expected increase in the effective transmission rate is between 1 2 to 1 4 this is far from the 19 fold increase that we obtained with the mass action hypothesis in section 4 while it is in good agreement with either the 1 92 ratio we obtained for Œ≤ with the reduction of section 2 3 2 or the 1 43 ratio obtained with the fast slow approximation of section 2 3 3 both obtained using the standard incidence choice fig e 9 a shows the change in the rate with an increase of 3 c for different base temperatures and for all the organisms analysed in gillooly et al 2001 and using their fit note that for all temperatures between 0 c and 30 c the rate change lies between 1 2 and 1 45 fig e 9 b shows the change in the rate for different temperature increases with a base temperature of t 287 k note that in order to obtain a 19 fold increase the temperature change should be at least of 30 c 8 8 a temperature change of 30 c could fall outside the range in which the study of gillooly et al 2001 is valid we just stress that a 19 fold rate change is unlikely for the case of a 3 c that correspond to the 2 data sets that we compare in this section the temperature dependence of metabolic rates has been reported in the context of epidemic parameters coelho and bezerra 2006 shapiro et al 2017 the behaviour of the metabolic rates re analysed here has been also found experimentally in epidemic contexts such as coelho and bezerra 2006 and shapiro et al 2017 i e the increase of the rates with temperature fulfil the ranges shown here 
24553,in a prequel to this paper we used non spatial temporal modelling to investigate the impact of non native ecosystem engineers on a small scale intertidal rocky shore in saldanha bay on the west coast of south africa where invasive species have changed the physical environment between 1980 and 2015 however we considered this approach incomplete without the direct inclusion of spatial modelling and zonation to address this we compared multiple layered simulations employing the food web approach of ecospace the spatial temporal module of ecopath with ecosim ewe our simulations included a control a simulation that restricted drivers to depth and habitat preferences two simulations to account for structural complexity as a function of the biomass of alien ecosystem engineers the first indirectly via mediation and the second via a novel plug in ecoengineer and lastly the inclusion of wave action to replicate its effects only the simulation that included the ecoengineer routine matched empirical observations of species diversity indices and the exclusion of the native mussel choromytilus meridionalis by the arriving alien mytilus galloprovincialis inclusion of mediation did not differ from the model simulation that used only habitat preference and depth to drive the model and the addition of wave action did not improve model fits our results emphasise that when analysing intertidal ecosystems they should be modelled with an explicit representation of structural habitat complexity over time and space and we consider that the application of our ecoengineer plug in is an effective and novel way of accomplishing this graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ecopath with ecosim ecospace ecoengineer ecosystem engineer intertidal invasive 1 introduction between 1980 and 2012 the intertidal rocky shore community on marcus island was subject to multiple successful invasions by the mediterranean mussel mytilus galloprovincialis the bisexual mussel semimytilus algosus and the pacific barnacle balanus glandula sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 as demonstrated in sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 2018 invasions by m galloprovincialis and to a lesser degree b glandula and s algosus were responsible for extensive ecosystem engineering effects particularly in the mid to low shore fig 1 and appendix a robinson et al 2007 sadchatheeswaran et al 2018 the formations these non native species created on the rocky shore affected structural complexity appendix a which is known to affect the access of native species to shelter feeding grounds and protection from predators jones et al 1994 sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 2019b when m galloprovincialis arrived on marcus island prior to 2001 it increased and homogenized complexity across most of the shore fig 1 and appendix a resulting in an increase in abundance and diversity of native species in the high shore and a decrease in both in the mid low shore by 2012 m galloprovincialis had declined and b glandula had replaced it in zones 3a and 3b as a result physical complexity in these zones decreased accompanied by a decline in both the abundance and diversity of native species at the same time s algosus invaded the low shore but its impacts on complexity were relatively small compared to those of m galloprovincialis in addition to changes in structural complexity by these non native ecosystem engineers marcus island also exhibits vertical zonation created by the gradient of physical factors between the extremes of tidal limits stephenson and stephenson 1949 vertical zonation is a consistent feature of intertidal rocky shores and exhibits repeatable patterns over large scales within biogeographic regions primarily related to shore height chappius et al 2014 understanding the role of space limitation and provision at various scales needs to be considered in order to realistically model rocky shore ecosystems crowe et al 2011 via ecosystem engineering the arrival of the three non native species mentioned above has changed the community compositions across the shore of not just marcus island but at multiple sites on the west and south coasts of south africa bownes and mcquaid 2006 laird and griffiths 2008 mead et al 2013 however marcus island is the only site with historical biomass data pre dating these invasions appendix a sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 2020 thus this study site provides us with the only possibility to learn how to best model the impact of non native ecosystem engineers to date few studies have used dynamic modelling to address the implications of ecosystem engineering for natural environments although one exception is the spatiotemporal model of otter re introduction to kelp forests off the coast of british columbia canada espinosa romero et al 2011 a previous paper by our team sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 written as a prequel to this study focused on temporal dynamics of a rocky intertidal ecosystem on marcus island on the west coast of south africa from 1980 pre invasion and 2015 post invasion in the present paper the spatial temporal modelling routine ecospace of ewe v6 5 walters et al 1999 christensen and walters 2004 was used to create a unique approach to spatiotemporal dynamic modelling of an intertidal rocky shore the objective was to compare model capabilities between the existing mediation modelling routine used to introduce structural complexity into a spatial model and a specially designed model plug in ecoengineer for ecospace steenbeek and sadchatheeswaran 2021 to do this required 1 creation of depth and habitat map layers that provided information about spatial preferences of functional groups 2 inclusion of dispersal behaviour of members of the intertidal community largely composed of sessile or slow moving groups and 3 incorporation of wave induced mortality on the low shore 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and trophic model of marcus island in 1980 marcus island 33 02 59 s 17 58 26 e on the west coast of south africa is a moderately exposed intertidal rocky shore on which the benthic community is dominated by filter feeders with low abundances of benthic predators as is the case other comparable shores in the region mcquaid and branch 1985 the community is protected from fishing and harvesting by virtue of being in the west coast national park and experiences wave forces averaging 11 3 x103 n m2 1 8 se n 10 steffani and branch 2003 the study area and model site were limited to the same 425 m2 a 25 m stretch extending between low spring tide and the upper limit of wave splash with a maximum water depth at high tide of 2 42 m sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 to create a spatially explicit ecospace model of marcus island spanning 1980 2015 the 1980 trophic model forced non native and relative native time series functional group biomasses 1980 2015 as described in detail in sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 were used in a layered approach to obtain the objectives outlined in the introduction of the present paper the same 30 functional groups including predators filter feeders grazers and zooplankton primary producers and detritus and their parameters b p b q b and ee were considered in our current study see table a2 and table a3 in sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 as well as the same dietary compositions of consumers in 1980 table a5 in sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 as such detritus import of primary producer detritus was required and net migration was estimated to balance the ecopath model table a6 in sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 a wave action fishing fleet was also included for low shore groups as described in our previous study section 2 4 4 of sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 2 2 temporal model of ecosim 1980 2015 after the ecopath model had been constructed an ecosim temporal model walters et al 1997 christensen and walters 2004 of marcus island was executed from 1980 pre invasion 2015 post invasion as described in the prequel paper sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 as with the ecopath model the ecosim model utilized time series see table a7 of sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 in which the biomasses of alien ecosystem engineers the mussels m galloprovincialis and s algosus and the barnacle b glandula were forced at every annual time step as advocated by langseth et al 2012 to help drive the model the model was fitted to the relative biomasses of the native functional groups which in turn changed the vulnerabilities of the prey of these groups by altering the ease with which a predator can find and capture its prey or the ease with which a prey species can find shelter from its predators mediation which is when one functional group mediates the predator prey relationship of two other groups can affect the vulnerability of prey by changing the trophic flow rate appendix a and see section 2 4 3 of sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 mediation can be introduced into ecosim as a way to allow ecosystem engineers to impact substrate shelter and feeding grounds and is thus an indirect method of introducing spatial complexity appendix a 2 3 spatial temporal model of ecospace the ecospace modelling routine works by replicating the dynamics of ecosim but over a grid of cells of equal predetermined size walters et al 1999 this grid is essentially a map of the study area in which the model ecosystem occurs and each cell is defined by the modeller as preferred or not preferred by each of the different functional groups christensen and walters 2004 initially biomass is spread evenly across all cells but the biomass of each functional group can move to the adjacent four cells around it based on preferences although biomass cannot move diagonally these preferences included depth or zone habitat type predation risk and availability of prey the rate of change in biomass per cell at any given time for any group is determined by the following equation walters et al 2010 d b i k d t e i q i k z i k b i k k m i k k b i k k m i k k b i k where b i k is the biomass of functional group i in spatial cell k e is the conversion efficiency of food intake into net production q is consumption z is the total mortality rate m i k k is the instantaneous movement of group i from spatial cell k into the adjacent cell k and m i k k is the same movement but in the opposite direction walters et al 2010 the rate of biomass movement amongst cells was also initially equal across all cells but can be altered based on whether the modeller introduces any of the following 1 advection by currents that can move biomass in a specific direction 2 habitat foraging capacity or a preference for different habitats that is linked to the movements feeding rates and survival of functional groups 3 dispersal rates of functional groups linked to their relative vulnerability and feeding rates in cells they prefer to avoid and 4 movement rates linked to functional group fitness walters et al 2010 christensen et al 2014 in this paper only habitat foraging capacity and dispersal rates were used to dictate the behaviour of functional groups appendix b as we had access to this information via expert opinion gm branch and tb robinson pers comm and our observations in field demonstrated that these factors could be linked to structural complexity 2 3 1 ecospace maps three map layers were created to represent the intertidal study area of marcus island 1 a base map 2 a depth layer table b1 and 3 a habitat foraging capacity layer table b2 the base map dictated the number of rows 44 and columns 50 in the grid of cells the physical location of the map with top left latitude 11 21 m and top left longitude 24 87 m values and the size of each cell which in this case was 0 5 m x 0 5 m the dimensions of this map matched the study area on marcus island i e an area of 425 m2 with a maximum shore width of 25 m between low spring tide and the upper limit of wave splash as most of the functional groups have a limit on how far up the shore they can survive i e how much exposure to air they can tolerate a depth layer was created as an environmental driver to moderate their movements within the grid marcus island has a relatively shallow slope with a maximum water depth at the bottom of the shore of 2 54 m at high tide but this slope was enough to create wide stripes of zonation sadchatheeswaran et al 2018 the method used to derive the depth map fig a1 b for this study is described in detail in appendix b three foraging responses to depth were generated to indicate functional group preferences for high mid or low elevation fig 2 table 1 two of these functions were sigmoidal and used four parameters ewe version 6 6 offers these options under the sigmoid legacy function type zero y zero and maximum y end unitless values for the foraging response a unitless scaling parameter y base and a unitless parameter steep that determined the steepness of the slope harvey 2014 these two functions decided whether a functional group had a maximum foraging response at the highest elevation or at the lowest elevation on the map a beta function was then used to determine whether a functional group had a maximum foraging response at mid elevation fig 2 table 1 the beta function used three parameters alpha and beta are shape parameters unitless and y scalar is a multiplication factor most of the groups were assigned preferences for living and feeding at a specific depth equating to shore height as demonstrated by data collected on marcus island every three months between 2012 and 2015 appendix a sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 2018 these preferences were used in ecospace to help drive movement of functional groups to certain areas of the map based on the depth layer table 2 functional groups that could survive at any depth in the intertidal included both plankton groups and both detritus groups the oystercatcher haematopus moquini hunts for prey all over the shore on marcus island hockey and underhill 1984 and so was also not given a preference for depth habitats were created to mirror the seven zones zones 1 2 3a 3b 4 5 and 6 observed on marcus island sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 fig 1 and fig 3 the widths of all zones were measured for a previous study along five transects between 2014 and 2016 over 11 biomonitoring trips sadchatheeswaran et al 2018 average widths derived from these surveys were calculated to create a habitat layer fig 3 in ecospace the divisions between adjacent zones were made less sharp to allow for more realistic transitions than depicted in fig 3 habitat or zone preference for each functional group was established based on community composition data from sadchatheeswaran et al 2018 table a2 in that paper when ecospace was first run all functional group biomasses were spread equally over the entire map so that if functional groups found themselves in a habitat they did not prefer they would move with a bias toward their preferred habitat to aid this movement base dispersal rate relative dispersal rate vulnerability to predators and feeding rate in bad cells for all groups were established from expert opinion table b2 and b3 gm branch and tb robinson pers comm ecospace sets the default dispersal rate of all functional groups at 300 km year 1 and in bad habitats the dispersal rate increases by five times the default relative vulnerability is doubled and relative feeding rate decreases to half the default rate however almost all the intertidal groups on marcus island excluding the birds are sedentary slow moving or sessile species and so their dispersal parameterizations were changed to reflect this in general base dispersal rate of slow moving species was decreased to 1 50 km year 1 while the base dispersal rate of sessile species was decreased to between 0 001 and 0 0001 km years 1 equating to little or no movement relative dispersal in unfavourable cells therefore also changed with sessile species unable to escape bad habitats whereas slow moving species like limpets could escape to better habitats only at triple their base dispersal rate the relative vulnerability of these species in bad habitats increased to five times their vulnerability in preferred habitats to reflect the harshness and overall sessile nature of intertidal community living the relative feeding rates of all the species in bad habitats were decreased to a quarter of their feeding rates in preferred habitats 2 3 2 structural complexity mediation mediation which is when one functional group mediates the predator prey relationship of two other groups can be used to model changes in the vulnerability of prey by changing the trophic flow rate appendix a christensen and walters 2004 in sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 structural complexity created by alien ecosystem engineers was introduced into the model in the ecosim routine by way of mediation changes in ecological services associated with increased structural complexity influenced amounts of substrate shelter and feeding grounds six mediation functions were created for the three ecosystem engineers the mediators which are described in detailed in sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 see section 2 4 3 fig 2 and table a8 in that paper as the biomass of the mediator increased these functions either increased prey vulnerability by increasing predator search rate via an increase in feeding grounds or decreased prey vulnerability by increasing substrate and shelter for each functional group personal observations expert input and results from previous related studies sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 2018 helped to determine which mediation function affected each group see table a9 in sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 for example when m galloprovincialis was observed covering all but zone 1 of the study site by 2001 it had increased the substrate and shelter available to most functional groups by making physically complex multi layered secondary substrate with lots of irregular gaps sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 when b glandula invaded zones 3a and 3b by 2012 that complexity was erased by a single layer of sharp barnacle beds which in turn exposed large scutellastra granularis to its predators an exception in the mediation functions was made for the mussel c meridionalis for which the mediation function that was used to increase predator search rate was also used to increase this native mussel s vulnerability to drive it to negligible levels by 2012 as observed on marcus island in reality sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 previously demonstrated that when all three effects substrate shelter and feeding grounds were combined in ecosim via mediation the resulting model values for biodiversity came closest to those measured on the shore in 2015 exceeding them by only 2 3 additionally the non native mussels were demonstrated to have the strongest effect and overall the impact of substrate was overwhelmed by the impacts of shelter and feeding grounds sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 as a combination of all ecological services created by all ecosystem engineers see table 2 simulation œà4 in sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 mediation was then brought into ecospace to determine whether its addition would improve predictions of the biomasses for each functional group over the simulated 35 years 1980 to 2015 2 3 3 structural complexity the ecoengineer plug in we used the modular architecture of the ewe software steenbeek et al 2016 to extend ecospace with a novel plug in ecoengineer steenbeek and sadchatheeswaran 2021 the plug in derived changes in structural complexity generated by ecosystem engineers which then was utilized in the ecospace spatial temporal modelling routine christensen et al 2014 to drive cell suitability for functional groups that benefitted from structural complexity the premise of ecoengineer consisted of two relationships 1 how the biomass of ecosystem engineers drove structural complexity and 2 how structural complexity influenced native functional groups the plug in allowed the biomasses of ecosystem engineering groups in this case small and large m galloprovincialis s algosus and b glandula to increase structural complexity using predetermined polynomial functions table 3 a these functions were interpolated from a series of experiments in blender 2 74 blender foundation 2012 where we measured the structural complexity of a series of 3d generated samples containing an increasing number of ecosystem engineer individuals table b4 measuring the interstitial space between ecosystem engineer individuals using the blender interstitial volume method described in sadchatheeswaran et al 2019a for every time step monthly from 1980 to 2015 and every cell ecoengineer calculated the total structural complexity as a function of the spatial distribution of biomass of the aliens the ecoengineer plug in fully described in steenbeek and sadchatheeswaran 2021 then placed this complexity in an environmental driver map layer the ecospace habitat foraging capacity model christensen et al 2014 was then used to express how specific native functional groups benefitted from available structural complexity much like depth section 2 3 1 foraging responses to the presence of structural complexity were created fig 4 table 3b these responses were applied to ecologically important native functional groups that were likely to experience a large decrease a moderate increase or a large increase in biomass with an increase in available structural complexity table 4 small granular limpet was given a moderate increase in foraging response to structural complexity rather than a large increase as expected to compensate for the lack of decrease in foraging response that large granular limpet should have these groups were selected based on results from sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 2018 as well as population responses noted in the literature hockey and van erkom schurink 1992 robinson et al 2007 branch et al 2010 2 4 ecospace parameterization and simulations the spatial capability of ecospace was primarily used to mimic and explore invasion of the rocky intertidal ecosystem by alien species starting with the 1980 ecosystem configuration pre invasion our study investigated whether the biomasses presented in the 2015 model of marcus island sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 could be replicated more accurately by incorporating structural complexity via mediation or via the ecoengineer plug in steenbeek and sadchatheeswaran 2021 to address this objective five different simulations termed here as runs to differentiate them from simulations in sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 were generated to see how 1 a control base map with only default dispersal rates 2 the presence of a map 3 use of mediation 4 use of the ecoengineer plug in and 5 presence of wave action affected the spatial arrangement and biomass of functional groups table 5 wave action was applied in similar manner as described in sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 by removing 10 of biomass of groups in zones 4 5 and 6 at every monthly time step between 1980 and 2015 in addition 50 of the biomass of groups in the low shore was removed during june 21 1994 september 5 2001 august 31 2008 june 24 2009 and august 12 2012 to simulate extra mortality caused by exceptionally large storms that occurred on these dates council for scientific and industrial research unpublished data to determine which run came the closest to replicating the 2015 post invasion ecopath model of marcus island described in sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 hereafter termed the 2015 model biomass values at the end of each run were compared to those presented in the 2015 model the 2015 model consolidated abundances measured directly on marcus island where available and for remaining groups the ecopath model was used to estimate biomasses required to support consumption by predators in the ecosystem as detailed in appendix a of this paper and section 2 2 and table a1 of sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 predicted values were considered implausibly high if they exceeded triple the 2015 model values and implausibly low if they were less than a quarter of the measured values values of the shannon wiener diversity index and pielou s evenness index were also calculated for each simulation sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 section 2 5 the best case simulation of the five was the one having the smallest number of implausible biomasses at the end of the simulation as well as species diversity indices quantitatively closest to the condition recorded on the island in 2015 for the best case run spatial maps of biomass and location of functional groups for the different periods 1980 2001 2012 and 2015 were created in arcgis using ascii data generated by ecospace spatial maps were created for the four alien functional groups as well as native functional groups that exhibited strong zonation and a notable response to structural complexity namely n dubia b reynaudi c meridionalis small and large s granularis small a atra p angulosus a knysnaensis p capensis and ulva spp success of a run was based on a the relative number of functional groups for which the run yielded biomasses by the year 2015 that could be classed as plausible and b the relative closeness of their species diversities to those of the 2015 model in quantifying success rate however only the first of these measures was employed 3 results run 1 foundation which included only the base map and default dispersion values and thus represented a control simulation was not surprisingly the least successful tables 6 and 7 with only the base map functional groups were confined to the study area but were spread evenly over the entire map for all time steps this was because there was no depth or habitat for species to selectively prefer and default dispersal movement meant that they could move from one end of the map to the other at the unrealistically high default rates at the end of the simulation all the functional group biomasses were implausibly low table 6 yielding a success rate of 0 in fact all native biomasses reached nearly negligible levels by 2015 in addition total living biomass and the indices of diversity and evenness at the end of run 1 were 95 96 smaller than those of the 2015 model table 7 run 2 movement included the base map depth layer habitat capacity and adjusted dispersal rates specific to each group functional groups could move into preferred habitats based on a preference for specific zones as specified in table b2 at a rate that reflected their behaviour and mobility on the shore this run produced the second worst set of biomasses relative to those in the 2015 model table 6 of the 26 native groups seven had implausibly high 2015 biomasses and seven had implausibly low biomasses so the success rate was only 46 multiple groups amongst predators filter feeders grazers and primary producers were affected of the predators biomass of the gull l dominicanus was implausibly high while biomasses of several other predators were unacceptably low biomass of the black mussel c meridionalis decreased but remained implausibly high never approaching the negligible levels predicted by its absence from the shore by 2015 of the grazers s granularis biomass decreased below acceptable levels whereas the biomass of the urchin p angulosus remained implausibly high and micro zooplankton increased to more than 5x that reported by previous studies of the benguela region watermeyer et al 2008 as did phytoplankton lastly sea lettuce ulva spp had an implausibly high biomass at the end of the simulation table 6 the total living biomass at the end of this run was 80 more than the 2015 model but indices of diversity and evenness were only 4 less than the 2015 model table 7 run 3 eco engineering 1 included all the spatial parameterization of run 2 but also included mediation however carrying mediation forward into ecospace did not improve the model predictions which were on a par with those of run 2 table 6 eight native groups had unacceptably high biomasses at the end of the model run while six had implausibly low biomasses so the success rate was again 46 at the end of the run biomasses of all predators except the oystercatcher h moquini and anemone b reynaudi were not comparable with those of the 2015 model small ribbed mussels a atra had a strikingly low biomass although biomass of large a atra was only 3 less than expected biomass of the black mussel c meridionalis which was expected to approach 0 01 g m 2 in 2015 decreased substantially but only to 3156 76 g m 2 and thus remained implausibly high but at least at a level nearer to reality than in run 2 biomass of large granular limpets s granularis was modelled to acceptable 2015 levels but not that of small s granularis false limpets s capensis or urchins p angulosus all of which reached smaller than acceptable biomasses at the end of the run as in run 2 the two plankton groups and ulva spp ended the simulation with higher than acceptable biomasses whereas other seaweeds ended with an implausibly low biomass table 6 the total amount of living biomass at the end of run 3 was however the closest to that registered for the 2015 model and the species diversity indices were both only 7 8 greater than expected table 7 run 4 eco engineering 2 in which the ecoengineer plug in steenbeek and sadchatheeswaran 2021 was employed was the most successful at replicating the 2015 model biomasses six groups had implausibly high biomasses including l dominicanus large a atra the periwinkle a knysnaensis both plankton groups and ulva spp table 6 only fish in the families clinidae and gobiidae which represented one group reached implausibly low biomasses success rate thus rose to 73 by using ecoengineer to force c meridionalis and p angulosus to decrease with an increase in structural complexity both were driven to negligible levels in 2015 converging on the reality that both were eliminated by 1982 1984 during the rise and peak of m galloprovincialis invasion total living biomass was much larger than expected but diversity and evenness ended identical to those of the 2015 model table 7 and see table 5 of sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 the addition of wave action in run 5 wave action in the form of extra mortality in zones 4 5 and 6 added to the input parameters and drivers used in run 4 did not appreciably change the end biomass values and slightly decreased the success rate to 69 the largest difference between runs 4 and 5 was the biomass of small s granularis which tripled with the addition of wave action this in turn meant that small s granularis had a higher than plausible biomass compared to the 2015 model table 6 otherwise run 4 and 5 were nearly identical despite the extra mortality created by wave action addition of wave action also created the largest total living biomass of all five runs mostly due to the increased biomass of small s granularis but associated species diversity indices were only 3 higher than those calculated for the 2015 model in sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 table 7 3 1 spatial maps as run 4 was the best case run spatial maps of all alien groups fig 5 and select native groups fig 6 were created for 1980 2001 2012 and 2015 aliens were absent in 1980 but small and large m galloprovincialis were recorded in 2001 for both sizes of m galloprovincialis spatial maps matched reality in 2001 small individuals invaded all areas of the map bar zones 1 and 2 and the distribution of large individuals was similar except for their additional exclusion from most of zone 3a fig 5 over time both small and large m galloprovincialis decreased in biomass at the bottom of shore and congregated mid shore semimytilus algosus was first recorded on marcus island in 2012 and although it was given a preference for the low shore in the model run 4 projected that it would be found mostly in the mid shore in 2012 and by 2015 would have unrealistically spread across the top and lower parts of the mid shore fig 5 the invasion and spread of b glandula were initially as expected with a dense concentration of individuals in the mid shore in 2012 as predicted but it became unrealistically evenly spread throughout the top and low shore by 2015 albeit at relative lower densities that did reflect the decline of b glandula over time fig 5 the native groups tended to stay within their preferred zones or depths but changed in biomass and became concentrated in specific zones over time fig 6 purple laver porphyra spp was realistically projected to be confined to zone 1 and sea lettuce ulva spp was largely confined to the top and mid shore also as expected fig 6 the periwinkle a knysnaensis contrary to what was observed on marcus island between 1980 and 2015 appeared to increase in biomass and covered zones 2 5 the granular limpet s granularis both large and small changed little in biomass and predominated in zones 3a 3b and 4 as expected the dogwhelk n dubia biomass scarcely changed over time but covered zones 3a 6 declining up the shore as anticipated small ribbed mussels a atra exhibited high biomass relative to other species in zones 3b 6 in all four years but declined over time as m galloprovincialis became more dominant however a atra did maintain dominance low on the shore in areas from which large m galloprovincialis withdrew the anemone b reynaudi which had a relatively high modelled biomass in zones 3b 6 in 1980 increased in biomass but spread further up the shore as structural complexity increased following introduction of m galloprovincialis fig 6 of the selected groups the most notable changes were to the black mussel c meridionalis and the urchin p angulosus both of which virtually disappeared from marcus island by 2001 fig 6 4 discussion space whether it be a fluid medium for travel or a substrate for attachment can create variation in how physical factors separate individuals and populations and can moderate access to resources at multiple scales andrewartha and birch 1984 jones et al 1994 blackwell 2007 without the inclusion of space dynamic models assume that all individuals within a population are uniformly distributed and move with the same behaviour cz√°r√°n 1998 to determine how best to recreate the trophic and non trophic impacts of invasive autogenic ecosystem engineers that changed the spatial complexity of marcus island s intertidal rocky shores between 1980 and 2015 different simulations or runs were generated in this study using the spatial temporal framework in ecopath with ecosim s spatial temporal modelling framework ecospace these included running the model with 1 just a base map 2 adding spatial preferences by groups for depth and habitat 3 adding mediation in addition to spatial preferences 4 using the new ecoengineer plug in addition to spatial preferences and 5 a combination of spatial preferences the ecoengineer plug in and wave action the fourth run proved the most capable of recreating an ecosystem of similar structure with similar biomasses and diversity to the 2015 model developed in sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 as well it was also the only method that successfully predicted the local extermination of the black mussel c meridionalis by 2012 as was empirically recorded on marcus island s intertidal shores spatiotemporal modelling in ecology is not a novel concept and has been frequently applied in both terrestrial vetaas 1993 mohanty and skaggs 2001 bolliger 2005 lischke et al 2006 and aquatic systems palomares and pauly 2005 ortiz et al 2009 walters et al 2010 ortiz et al 2013a 2013b 2015 espinosa romero et al 2011 tian et al 2011 lewis et al 2016 many spatiotemporal models in ecology focus on the spread of individuals or biomass over time in a spatially explicit manner bascompte and sol√© 1995 chen et al 2011 using a combination of physical biological and chemical data that grant individuals within the model the ability to choose where they reside to maximize their survival jones and west 2005 christensen et al 2014 mathematical models that describe the impact of ecosystem engineers on environments and general population growth have also been developed gilad et al 2007 cuddington et al 2009 the choice of ecopath with ecosim in this study and its prequel sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 was based on both its user friendliness and to allow us to assess a whole ecosystem at multiple trophic levels at the same resolution christensen and walters 2004 we previously attempted to use mediation in ecosim to mimic the changes brought about by ecosystem engineers on marcus island s intertidal community sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 but could not account for zonation or competition for space other studies have also noted limitations to using mediation as the relationships that the functions strive to replicate are difficult to measure and many assumptions must be made harvey 2014 espinosa romero et al 2011 ecoengineer allowed the direct application of measured structural complexity and its dynamic relationship to the biomass of different alien ecosystem engineers and native species despite its success the model did exhibit some limitations of the ten groups that were allocated a foraging response to structural complexity table 4 eight ended the simulation with plausible biomasses in run 4 ecoengineer plugin the two groups that did not were the periwinkle a knysnaensis and the algae ulva spp in sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 it was noted that a knysnaensis responded favourably to the domination of zone 3a by b glandula sheltering in empty tests or between live barnacles so it was assumed that it would respond positively to the complexity created by b glandula relative to that of bare rocks a similar association exists in hong kong where the periwinkles echinolittorina malaccana and e vidua make use of microhabitats formed by the acorn barnacle tetraclita japonica particularly in summer cartwright and williams 2012 therefore a knysnaensis was assigned a moderate increase in foraging success in response to structural complexity in the present study which created a greater than plausible biomass of a knysnaensis in 2015 this is most likely because in the spatial model a knysnaensis would also possibly erroneously have reacted positively to the even greater complexity created by the aliens m galloprovincialis and s algosus which dominated in zones lower on the shore than those occupied by a knysnaensis in the case of ulva spp the model increase in biomass in response to structural complexity could have been exaggerated by the unexpected increase of b glandula and s algosus in the top shore fig 5 both of which contribute to the decrease in ulva spp s prey vulnerability by increasing secondary substrate the four other groups that also experienced an unrealistic response to structural complexity were the gull l dominicanus the fish clinidae and gobiidae and both plankton groups these groups however were not well parameterized because they were not measured on marcus island and as such were overestimated at the end of the simulation when the model was still not spatially explicit table 6 lastly the addition of effects of wave action which acted as fishing fleets that removed specified amounts of biomass from the lower zones of the shore surprisingly yielded minimal effects which is probably an unrealistic outcome a further extension of ecospace specific to intertidal rocky shore modelling might be required in which waves can remove individuals at a rate determined by their zonation and susceptibility to wave action it is recognised that the absolute spatial model results are dependant on both the dispersal and habitat preferences assigned for each functional group as mentioned earlier these were based on our best understanding of the functional groups in the marcus island ecosystem and used to generate a series of possible spatial outcomes that could be compared against one another given the comparative nature of the study to assess most appropriate ways of capturing spatial impacts of invasive alien ecosystem engineers an extensive sensitivity test of these two input parameters was not conducted the success of the ecoengineer plug in steenbeek and sadchatheeswaran 2021 was mainly dependant on the efficacy of the blender interstitial volume method utilized in sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 described in sadchatheeswaran et al 2019a and verified in sadchatheeswaran et al 2019b this 3d graphic modelling method allowed the direct measurement of structural complexity the maximum volume of space available for other organisms to occupy created by ecosystem engineers as it was virtual structural complexity could easily be calculated table b4 for each ecosystem engineer and then combined for all ecosystem engineers in the first step of the ecoengineer plug in steenbeek and sadchatheeswaran 2021 three dimensional modelling is a familiar tool for industry artists video game designers engineers and architects but in this study it made possible the combination of quantitatively determined complexity with spatiotemporal modelling other marine scientists have also found productive uses for 3d modelling one example of which is the hydrous project which create 3d replicas of corals to visualize in real time the impacts of various factors including disease and bleaching on coral reefs medlock 2015 nuwer 2015 woolsey and hall 2016 mings 2017 with further development ecoengineer could potentially test the efficacy of similar artificial reef projects while expanding ecosystem impact analysis for coastal development projects that have already been explored in ecospace such as that reported by the port of metro vancouver 2015 5 conclusion in this study an ecopath with ecosim model was used to build a spatially explicit credible small scale intertidal model of marcus island from 1980 pre invasion by three alien species to 2015 post invasion the model incorporated depth and habitat preferences affecting multiple functional groups as observed in sadchatheeswaran et al 2018 and included quantitative properties of structural complexity demonstrated in sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 2019b specifically it addresses the limitations of intertidal modelling that emerged in the prequel to this paper sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 namely the absence of an spatial analysis the application of a novel plug in for ecospace ecoengineer introduced structural complexity as a function of ecosystem engineer biomass ecoengineer allowed direct non trophic quantitative relationships to be defined between the alien ecosystem engineers and several important native groups in the model by providing spatial explicitness in the form of habitat and depth preferences the study also addresses zonation and competition for space even without wave action the trajectories of most of the biomasses of the modelled functional groups on marcus island from 1980 to 2015 mimicked reality i e empirical values measured during monitoring studies ecoengineer yielded not only realistic predictions of the biomass of most of the functional groups incorporated in the model but also produced insights into the likely mechanisms of interactions we believe it offers the most effective and user friendly means of modelling dynamic spatially organised benthic systems

24553,in a prequel to this paper we used non spatial temporal modelling to investigate the impact of non native ecosystem engineers on a small scale intertidal rocky shore in saldanha bay on the west coast of south africa where invasive species have changed the physical environment between 1980 and 2015 however we considered this approach incomplete without the direct inclusion of spatial modelling and zonation to address this we compared multiple layered simulations employing the food web approach of ecospace the spatial temporal module of ecopath with ecosim ewe our simulations included a control a simulation that restricted drivers to depth and habitat preferences two simulations to account for structural complexity as a function of the biomass of alien ecosystem engineers the first indirectly via mediation and the second via a novel plug in ecoengineer and lastly the inclusion of wave action to replicate its effects only the simulation that included the ecoengineer routine matched empirical observations of species diversity indices and the exclusion of the native mussel choromytilus meridionalis by the arriving alien mytilus galloprovincialis inclusion of mediation did not differ from the model simulation that used only habitat preference and depth to drive the model and the addition of wave action did not improve model fits our results emphasise that when analysing intertidal ecosystems they should be modelled with an explicit representation of structural habitat complexity over time and space and we consider that the application of our ecoengineer plug in is an effective and novel way of accomplishing this graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ecopath with ecosim ecospace ecoengineer ecosystem engineer intertidal invasive 1 introduction between 1980 and 2012 the intertidal rocky shore community on marcus island was subject to multiple successful invasions by the mediterranean mussel mytilus galloprovincialis the bisexual mussel semimytilus algosus and the pacific barnacle balanus glandula sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 as demonstrated in sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 2018 invasions by m galloprovincialis and to a lesser degree b glandula and s algosus were responsible for extensive ecosystem engineering effects particularly in the mid to low shore fig 1 and appendix a robinson et al 2007 sadchatheeswaran et al 2018 the formations these non native species created on the rocky shore affected structural complexity appendix a which is known to affect the access of native species to shelter feeding grounds and protection from predators jones et al 1994 sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 2019b when m galloprovincialis arrived on marcus island prior to 2001 it increased and homogenized complexity across most of the shore fig 1 and appendix a resulting in an increase in abundance and diversity of native species in the high shore and a decrease in both in the mid low shore by 2012 m galloprovincialis had declined and b glandula had replaced it in zones 3a and 3b as a result physical complexity in these zones decreased accompanied by a decline in both the abundance and diversity of native species at the same time s algosus invaded the low shore but its impacts on complexity were relatively small compared to those of m galloprovincialis in addition to changes in structural complexity by these non native ecosystem engineers marcus island also exhibits vertical zonation created by the gradient of physical factors between the extremes of tidal limits stephenson and stephenson 1949 vertical zonation is a consistent feature of intertidal rocky shores and exhibits repeatable patterns over large scales within biogeographic regions primarily related to shore height chappius et al 2014 understanding the role of space limitation and provision at various scales needs to be considered in order to realistically model rocky shore ecosystems crowe et al 2011 via ecosystem engineering the arrival of the three non native species mentioned above has changed the community compositions across the shore of not just marcus island but at multiple sites on the west and south coasts of south africa bownes and mcquaid 2006 laird and griffiths 2008 mead et al 2013 however marcus island is the only site with historical biomass data pre dating these invasions appendix a sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 2020 thus this study site provides us with the only possibility to learn how to best model the impact of non native ecosystem engineers to date few studies have used dynamic modelling to address the implications of ecosystem engineering for natural environments although one exception is the spatiotemporal model of otter re introduction to kelp forests off the coast of british columbia canada espinosa romero et al 2011 a previous paper by our team sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 written as a prequel to this study focused on temporal dynamics of a rocky intertidal ecosystem on marcus island on the west coast of south africa from 1980 pre invasion and 2015 post invasion in the present paper the spatial temporal modelling routine ecospace of ewe v6 5 walters et al 1999 christensen and walters 2004 was used to create a unique approach to spatiotemporal dynamic modelling of an intertidal rocky shore the objective was to compare model capabilities between the existing mediation modelling routine used to introduce structural complexity into a spatial model and a specially designed model plug in ecoengineer for ecospace steenbeek and sadchatheeswaran 2021 to do this required 1 creation of depth and habitat map layers that provided information about spatial preferences of functional groups 2 inclusion of dispersal behaviour of members of the intertidal community largely composed of sessile or slow moving groups and 3 incorporation of wave induced mortality on the low shore 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and trophic model of marcus island in 1980 marcus island 33 02 59 s 17 58 26 e on the west coast of south africa is a moderately exposed intertidal rocky shore on which the benthic community is dominated by filter feeders with low abundances of benthic predators as is the case other comparable shores in the region mcquaid and branch 1985 the community is protected from fishing and harvesting by virtue of being in the west coast national park and experiences wave forces averaging 11 3 x103 n m2 1 8 se n 10 steffani and branch 2003 the study area and model site were limited to the same 425 m2 a 25 m stretch extending between low spring tide and the upper limit of wave splash with a maximum water depth at high tide of 2 42 m sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 to create a spatially explicit ecospace model of marcus island spanning 1980 2015 the 1980 trophic model forced non native and relative native time series functional group biomasses 1980 2015 as described in detail in sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 were used in a layered approach to obtain the objectives outlined in the introduction of the present paper the same 30 functional groups including predators filter feeders grazers and zooplankton primary producers and detritus and their parameters b p b q b and ee were considered in our current study see table a2 and table a3 in sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 as well as the same dietary compositions of consumers in 1980 table a5 in sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 as such detritus import of primary producer detritus was required and net migration was estimated to balance the ecopath model table a6 in sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 a wave action fishing fleet was also included for low shore groups as described in our previous study section 2 4 4 of sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 2 2 temporal model of ecosim 1980 2015 after the ecopath model had been constructed an ecosim temporal model walters et al 1997 christensen and walters 2004 of marcus island was executed from 1980 pre invasion 2015 post invasion as described in the prequel paper sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 as with the ecopath model the ecosim model utilized time series see table a7 of sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 in which the biomasses of alien ecosystem engineers the mussels m galloprovincialis and s algosus and the barnacle b glandula were forced at every annual time step as advocated by langseth et al 2012 to help drive the model the model was fitted to the relative biomasses of the native functional groups which in turn changed the vulnerabilities of the prey of these groups by altering the ease with which a predator can find and capture its prey or the ease with which a prey species can find shelter from its predators mediation which is when one functional group mediates the predator prey relationship of two other groups can affect the vulnerability of prey by changing the trophic flow rate appendix a and see section 2 4 3 of sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 mediation can be introduced into ecosim as a way to allow ecosystem engineers to impact substrate shelter and feeding grounds and is thus an indirect method of introducing spatial complexity appendix a 2 3 spatial temporal model of ecospace the ecospace modelling routine works by replicating the dynamics of ecosim but over a grid of cells of equal predetermined size walters et al 1999 this grid is essentially a map of the study area in which the model ecosystem occurs and each cell is defined by the modeller as preferred or not preferred by each of the different functional groups christensen and walters 2004 initially biomass is spread evenly across all cells but the biomass of each functional group can move to the adjacent four cells around it based on preferences although biomass cannot move diagonally these preferences included depth or zone habitat type predation risk and availability of prey the rate of change in biomass per cell at any given time for any group is determined by the following equation walters et al 2010 d b i k d t e i q i k z i k b i k k m i k k b i k k m i k k b i k where b i k is the biomass of functional group i in spatial cell k e is the conversion efficiency of food intake into net production q is consumption z is the total mortality rate m i k k is the instantaneous movement of group i from spatial cell k into the adjacent cell k and m i k k is the same movement but in the opposite direction walters et al 2010 the rate of biomass movement amongst cells was also initially equal across all cells but can be altered based on whether the modeller introduces any of the following 1 advection by currents that can move biomass in a specific direction 2 habitat foraging capacity or a preference for different habitats that is linked to the movements feeding rates and survival of functional groups 3 dispersal rates of functional groups linked to their relative vulnerability and feeding rates in cells they prefer to avoid and 4 movement rates linked to functional group fitness walters et al 2010 christensen et al 2014 in this paper only habitat foraging capacity and dispersal rates were used to dictate the behaviour of functional groups appendix b as we had access to this information via expert opinion gm branch and tb robinson pers comm and our observations in field demonstrated that these factors could be linked to structural complexity 2 3 1 ecospace maps three map layers were created to represent the intertidal study area of marcus island 1 a base map 2 a depth layer table b1 and 3 a habitat foraging capacity layer table b2 the base map dictated the number of rows 44 and columns 50 in the grid of cells the physical location of the map with top left latitude 11 21 m and top left longitude 24 87 m values and the size of each cell which in this case was 0 5 m x 0 5 m the dimensions of this map matched the study area on marcus island i e an area of 425 m2 with a maximum shore width of 25 m between low spring tide and the upper limit of wave splash as most of the functional groups have a limit on how far up the shore they can survive i e how much exposure to air they can tolerate a depth layer was created as an environmental driver to moderate their movements within the grid marcus island has a relatively shallow slope with a maximum water depth at the bottom of the shore of 2 54 m at high tide but this slope was enough to create wide stripes of zonation sadchatheeswaran et al 2018 the method used to derive the depth map fig a1 b for this study is described in detail in appendix b three foraging responses to depth were generated to indicate functional group preferences for high mid or low elevation fig 2 table 1 two of these functions were sigmoidal and used four parameters ewe version 6 6 offers these options under the sigmoid legacy function type zero y zero and maximum y end unitless values for the foraging response a unitless scaling parameter y base and a unitless parameter steep that determined the steepness of the slope harvey 2014 these two functions decided whether a functional group had a maximum foraging response at the highest elevation or at the lowest elevation on the map a beta function was then used to determine whether a functional group had a maximum foraging response at mid elevation fig 2 table 1 the beta function used three parameters alpha and beta are shape parameters unitless and y scalar is a multiplication factor most of the groups were assigned preferences for living and feeding at a specific depth equating to shore height as demonstrated by data collected on marcus island every three months between 2012 and 2015 appendix a sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 2018 these preferences were used in ecospace to help drive movement of functional groups to certain areas of the map based on the depth layer table 2 functional groups that could survive at any depth in the intertidal included both plankton groups and both detritus groups the oystercatcher haematopus moquini hunts for prey all over the shore on marcus island hockey and underhill 1984 and so was also not given a preference for depth habitats were created to mirror the seven zones zones 1 2 3a 3b 4 5 and 6 observed on marcus island sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 fig 1 and fig 3 the widths of all zones were measured for a previous study along five transects between 2014 and 2016 over 11 biomonitoring trips sadchatheeswaran et al 2018 average widths derived from these surveys were calculated to create a habitat layer fig 3 in ecospace the divisions between adjacent zones were made less sharp to allow for more realistic transitions than depicted in fig 3 habitat or zone preference for each functional group was established based on community composition data from sadchatheeswaran et al 2018 table a2 in that paper when ecospace was first run all functional group biomasses were spread equally over the entire map so that if functional groups found themselves in a habitat they did not prefer they would move with a bias toward their preferred habitat to aid this movement base dispersal rate relative dispersal rate vulnerability to predators and feeding rate in bad cells for all groups were established from expert opinion table b2 and b3 gm branch and tb robinson pers comm ecospace sets the default dispersal rate of all functional groups at 300 km year 1 and in bad habitats the dispersal rate increases by five times the default relative vulnerability is doubled and relative feeding rate decreases to half the default rate however almost all the intertidal groups on marcus island excluding the birds are sedentary slow moving or sessile species and so their dispersal parameterizations were changed to reflect this in general base dispersal rate of slow moving species was decreased to 1 50 km year 1 while the base dispersal rate of sessile species was decreased to between 0 001 and 0 0001 km years 1 equating to little or no movement relative dispersal in unfavourable cells therefore also changed with sessile species unable to escape bad habitats whereas slow moving species like limpets could escape to better habitats only at triple their base dispersal rate the relative vulnerability of these species in bad habitats increased to five times their vulnerability in preferred habitats to reflect the harshness and overall sessile nature of intertidal community living the relative feeding rates of all the species in bad habitats were decreased to a quarter of their feeding rates in preferred habitats 2 3 2 structural complexity mediation mediation which is when one functional group mediates the predator prey relationship of two other groups can be used to model changes in the vulnerability of prey by changing the trophic flow rate appendix a christensen and walters 2004 in sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 structural complexity created by alien ecosystem engineers was introduced into the model in the ecosim routine by way of mediation changes in ecological services associated with increased structural complexity influenced amounts of substrate shelter and feeding grounds six mediation functions were created for the three ecosystem engineers the mediators which are described in detailed in sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 see section 2 4 3 fig 2 and table a8 in that paper as the biomass of the mediator increased these functions either increased prey vulnerability by increasing predator search rate via an increase in feeding grounds or decreased prey vulnerability by increasing substrate and shelter for each functional group personal observations expert input and results from previous related studies sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 2018 helped to determine which mediation function affected each group see table a9 in sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 for example when m galloprovincialis was observed covering all but zone 1 of the study site by 2001 it had increased the substrate and shelter available to most functional groups by making physically complex multi layered secondary substrate with lots of irregular gaps sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 when b glandula invaded zones 3a and 3b by 2012 that complexity was erased by a single layer of sharp barnacle beds which in turn exposed large scutellastra granularis to its predators an exception in the mediation functions was made for the mussel c meridionalis for which the mediation function that was used to increase predator search rate was also used to increase this native mussel s vulnerability to drive it to negligible levels by 2012 as observed on marcus island in reality sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 previously demonstrated that when all three effects substrate shelter and feeding grounds were combined in ecosim via mediation the resulting model values for biodiversity came closest to those measured on the shore in 2015 exceeding them by only 2 3 additionally the non native mussels were demonstrated to have the strongest effect and overall the impact of substrate was overwhelmed by the impacts of shelter and feeding grounds sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 as a combination of all ecological services created by all ecosystem engineers see table 2 simulation œà4 in sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 mediation was then brought into ecospace to determine whether its addition would improve predictions of the biomasses for each functional group over the simulated 35 years 1980 to 2015 2 3 3 structural complexity the ecoengineer plug in we used the modular architecture of the ewe software steenbeek et al 2016 to extend ecospace with a novel plug in ecoengineer steenbeek and sadchatheeswaran 2021 the plug in derived changes in structural complexity generated by ecosystem engineers which then was utilized in the ecospace spatial temporal modelling routine christensen et al 2014 to drive cell suitability for functional groups that benefitted from structural complexity the premise of ecoengineer consisted of two relationships 1 how the biomass of ecosystem engineers drove structural complexity and 2 how structural complexity influenced native functional groups the plug in allowed the biomasses of ecosystem engineering groups in this case small and large m galloprovincialis s algosus and b glandula to increase structural complexity using predetermined polynomial functions table 3 a these functions were interpolated from a series of experiments in blender 2 74 blender foundation 2012 where we measured the structural complexity of a series of 3d generated samples containing an increasing number of ecosystem engineer individuals table b4 measuring the interstitial space between ecosystem engineer individuals using the blender interstitial volume method described in sadchatheeswaran et al 2019a for every time step monthly from 1980 to 2015 and every cell ecoengineer calculated the total structural complexity as a function of the spatial distribution of biomass of the aliens the ecoengineer plug in fully described in steenbeek and sadchatheeswaran 2021 then placed this complexity in an environmental driver map layer the ecospace habitat foraging capacity model christensen et al 2014 was then used to express how specific native functional groups benefitted from available structural complexity much like depth section 2 3 1 foraging responses to the presence of structural complexity were created fig 4 table 3b these responses were applied to ecologically important native functional groups that were likely to experience a large decrease a moderate increase or a large increase in biomass with an increase in available structural complexity table 4 small granular limpet was given a moderate increase in foraging response to structural complexity rather than a large increase as expected to compensate for the lack of decrease in foraging response that large granular limpet should have these groups were selected based on results from sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 2018 as well as population responses noted in the literature hockey and van erkom schurink 1992 robinson et al 2007 branch et al 2010 2 4 ecospace parameterization and simulations the spatial capability of ecospace was primarily used to mimic and explore invasion of the rocky intertidal ecosystem by alien species starting with the 1980 ecosystem configuration pre invasion our study investigated whether the biomasses presented in the 2015 model of marcus island sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 could be replicated more accurately by incorporating structural complexity via mediation or via the ecoengineer plug in steenbeek and sadchatheeswaran 2021 to address this objective five different simulations termed here as runs to differentiate them from simulations in sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 were generated to see how 1 a control base map with only default dispersal rates 2 the presence of a map 3 use of mediation 4 use of the ecoengineer plug in and 5 presence of wave action affected the spatial arrangement and biomass of functional groups table 5 wave action was applied in similar manner as described in sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 by removing 10 of biomass of groups in zones 4 5 and 6 at every monthly time step between 1980 and 2015 in addition 50 of the biomass of groups in the low shore was removed during june 21 1994 september 5 2001 august 31 2008 june 24 2009 and august 12 2012 to simulate extra mortality caused by exceptionally large storms that occurred on these dates council for scientific and industrial research unpublished data to determine which run came the closest to replicating the 2015 post invasion ecopath model of marcus island described in sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 hereafter termed the 2015 model biomass values at the end of each run were compared to those presented in the 2015 model the 2015 model consolidated abundances measured directly on marcus island where available and for remaining groups the ecopath model was used to estimate biomasses required to support consumption by predators in the ecosystem as detailed in appendix a of this paper and section 2 2 and table a1 of sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 predicted values were considered implausibly high if they exceeded triple the 2015 model values and implausibly low if they were less than a quarter of the measured values values of the shannon wiener diversity index and pielou s evenness index were also calculated for each simulation sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 section 2 5 the best case simulation of the five was the one having the smallest number of implausible biomasses at the end of the simulation as well as species diversity indices quantitatively closest to the condition recorded on the island in 2015 for the best case run spatial maps of biomass and location of functional groups for the different periods 1980 2001 2012 and 2015 were created in arcgis using ascii data generated by ecospace spatial maps were created for the four alien functional groups as well as native functional groups that exhibited strong zonation and a notable response to structural complexity namely n dubia b reynaudi c meridionalis small and large s granularis small a atra p angulosus a knysnaensis p capensis and ulva spp success of a run was based on a the relative number of functional groups for which the run yielded biomasses by the year 2015 that could be classed as plausible and b the relative closeness of their species diversities to those of the 2015 model in quantifying success rate however only the first of these measures was employed 3 results run 1 foundation which included only the base map and default dispersion values and thus represented a control simulation was not surprisingly the least successful tables 6 and 7 with only the base map functional groups were confined to the study area but were spread evenly over the entire map for all time steps this was because there was no depth or habitat for species to selectively prefer and default dispersal movement meant that they could move from one end of the map to the other at the unrealistically high default rates at the end of the simulation all the functional group biomasses were implausibly low table 6 yielding a success rate of 0 in fact all native biomasses reached nearly negligible levels by 2015 in addition total living biomass and the indices of diversity and evenness at the end of run 1 were 95 96 smaller than those of the 2015 model table 7 run 2 movement included the base map depth layer habitat capacity and adjusted dispersal rates specific to each group functional groups could move into preferred habitats based on a preference for specific zones as specified in table b2 at a rate that reflected their behaviour and mobility on the shore this run produced the second worst set of biomasses relative to those in the 2015 model table 6 of the 26 native groups seven had implausibly high 2015 biomasses and seven had implausibly low biomasses so the success rate was only 46 multiple groups amongst predators filter feeders grazers and primary producers were affected of the predators biomass of the gull l dominicanus was implausibly high while biomasses of several other predators were unacceptably low biomass of the black mussel c meridionalis decreased but remained implausibly high never approaching the negligible levels predicted by its absence from the shore by 2015 of the grazers s granularis biomass decreased below acceptable levels whereas the biomass of the urchin p angulosus remained implausibly high and micro zooplankton increased to more than 5x that reported by previous studies of the benguela region watermeyer et al 2008 as did phytoplankton lastly sea lettuce ulva spp had an implausibly high biomass at the end of the simulation table 6 the total living biomass at the end of this run was 80 more than the 2015 model but indices of diversity and evenness were only 4 less than the 2015 model table 7 run 3 eco engineering 1 included all the spatial parameterization of run 2 but also included mediation however carrying mediation forward into ecospace did not improve the model predictions which were on a par with those of run 2 table 6 eight native groups had unacceptably high biomasses at the end of the model run while six had implausibly low biomasses so the success rate was again 46 at the end of the run biomasses of all predators except the oystercatcher h moquini and anemone b reynaudi were not comparable with those of the 2015 model small ribbed mussels a atra had a strikingly low biomass although biomass of large a atra was only 3 less than expected biomass of the black mussel c meridionalis which was expected to approach 0 01 g m 2 in 2015 decreased substantially but only to 3156 76 g m 2 and thus remained implausibly high but at least at a level nearer to reality than in run 2 biomass of large granular limpets s granularis was modelled to acceptable 2015 levels but not that of small s granularis false limpets s capensis or urchins p angulosus all of which reached smaller than acceptable biomasses at the end of the run as in run 2 the two plankton groups and ulva spp ended the simulation with higher than acceptable biomasses whereas other seaweeds ended with an implausibly low biomass table 6 the total amount of living biomass at the end of run 3 was however the closest to that registered for the 2015 model and the species diversity indices were both only 7 8 greater than expected table 7 run 4 eco engineering 2 in which the ecoengineer plug in steenbeek and sadchatheeswaran 2021 was employed was the most successful at replicating the 2015 model biomasses six groups had implausibly high biomasses including l dominicanus large a atra the periwinkle a knysnaensis both plankton groups and ulva spp table 6 only fish in the families clinidae and gobiidae which represented one group reached implausibly low biomasses success rate thus rose to 73 by using ecoengineer to force c meridionalis and p angulosus to decrease with an increase in structural complexity both were driven to negligible levels in 2015 converging on the reality that both were eliminated by 1982 1984 during the rise and peak of m galloprovincialis invasion total living biomass was much larger than expected but diversity and evenness ended identical to those of the 2015 model table 7 and see table 5 of sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 the addition of wave action in run 5 wave action in the form of extra mortality in zones 4 5 and 6 added to the input parameters and drivers used in run 4 did not appreciably change the end biomass values and slightly decreased the success rate to 69 the largest difference between runs 4 and 5 was the biomass of small s granularis which tripled with the addition of wave action this in turn meant that small s granularis had a higher than plausible biomass compared to the 2015 model table 6 otherwise run 4 and 5 were nearly identical despite the extra mortality created by wave action addition of wave action also created the largest total living biomass of all five runs mostly due to the increased biomass of small s granularis but associated species diversity indices were only 3 higher than those calculated for the 2015 model in sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 table 7 3 1 spatial maps as run 4 was the best case run spatial maps of all alien groups fig 5 and select native groups fig 6 were created for 1980 2001 2012 and 2015 aliens were absent in 1980 but small and large m galloprovincialis were recorded in 2001 for both sizes of m galloprovincialis spatial maps matched reality in 2001 small individuals invaded all areas of the map bar zones 1 and 2 and the distribution of large individuals was similar except for their additional exclusion from most of zone 3a fig 5 over time both small and large m galloprovincialis decreased in biomass at the bottom of shore and congregated mid shore semimytilus algosus was first recorded on marcus island in 2012 and although it was given a preference for the low shore in the model run 4 projected that it would be found mostly in the mid shore in 2012 and by 2015 would have unrealistically spread across the top and lower parts of the mid shore fig 5 the invasion and spread of b glandula were initially as expected with a dense concentration of individuals in the mid shore in 2012 as predicted but it became unrealistically evenly spread throughout the top and low shore by 2015 albeit at relative lower densities that did reflect the decline of b glandula over time fig 5 the native groups tended to stay within their preferred zones or depths but changed in biomass and became concentrated in specific zones over time fig 6 purple laver porphyra spp was realistically projected to be confined to zone 1 and sea lettuce ulva spp was largely confined to the top and mid shore also as expected fig 6 the periwinkle a knysnaensis contrary to what was observed on marcus island between 1980 and 2015 appeared to increase in biomass and covered zones 2 5 the granular limpet s granularis both large and small changed little in biomass and predominated in zones 3a 3b and 4 as expected the dogwhelk n dubia biomass scarcely changed over time but covered zones 3a 6 declining up the shore as anticipated small ribbed mussels a atra exhibited high biomass relative to other species in zones 3b 6 in all four years but declined over time as m galloprovincialis became more dominant however a atra did maintain dominance low on the shore in areas from which large m galloprovincialis withdrew the anemone b reynaudi which had a relatively high modelled biomass in zones 3b 6 in 1980 increased in biomass but spread further up the shore as structural complexity increased following introduction of m galloprovincialis fig 6 of the selected groups the most notable changes were to the black mussel c meridionalis and the urchin p angulosus both of which virtually disappeared from marcus island by 2001 fig 6 4 discussion space whether it be a fluid medium for travel or a substrate for attachment can create variation in how physical factors separate individuals and populations and can moderate access to resources at multiple scales andrewartha and birch 1984 jones et al 1994 blackwell 2007 without the inclusion of space dynamic models assume that all individuals within a population are uniformly distributed and move with the same behaviour cz√°r√°n 1998 to determine how best to recreate the trophic and non trophic impacts of invasive autogenic ecosystem engineers that changed the spatial complexity of marcus island s intertidal rocky shores between 1980 and 2015 different simulations or runs were generated in this study using the spatial temporal framework in ecopath with ecosim s spatial temporal modelling framework ecospace these included running the model with 1 just a base map 2 adding spatial preferences by groups for depth and habitat 3 adding mediation in addition to spatial preferences 4 using the new ecoengineer plug in addition to spatial preferences and 5 a combination of spatial preferences the ecoengineer plug in and wave action the fourth run proved the most capable of recreating an ecosystem of similar structure with similar biomasses and diversity to the 2015 model developed in sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 as well it was also the only method that successfully predicted the local extermination of the black mussel c meridionalis by 2012 as was empirically recorded on marcus island s intertidal shores spatiotemporal modelling in ecology is not a novel concept and has been frequently applied in both terrestrial vetaas 1993 mohanty and skaggs 2001 bolliger 2005 lischke et al 2006 and aquatic systems palomares and pauly 2005 ortiz et al 2009 walters et al 2010 ortiz et al 2013a 2013b 2015 espinosa romero et al 2011 tian et al 2011 lewis et al 2016 many spatiotemporal models in ecology focus on the spread of individuals or biomass over time in a spatially explicit manner bascompte and sol√© 1995 chen et al 2011 using a combination of physical biological and chemical data that grant individuals within the model the ability to choose where they reside to maximize their survival jones and west 2005 christensen et al 2014 mathematical models that describe the impact of ecosystem engineers on environments and general population growth have also been developed gilad et al 2007 cuddington et al 2009 the choice of ecopath with ecosim in this study and its prequel sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 was based on both its user friendliness and to allow us to assess a whole ecosystem at multiple trophic levels at the same resolution christensen and walters 2004 we previously attempted to use mediation in ecosim to mimic the changes brought about by ecosystem engineers on marcus island s intertidal community sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 but could not account for zonation or competition for space other studies have also noted limitations to using mediation as the relationships that the functions strive to replicate are difficult to measure and many assumptions must be made harvey 2014 espinosa romero et al 2011 ecoengineer allowed the direct application of measured structural complexity and its dynamic relationship to the biomass of different alien ecosystem engineers and native species despite its success the model did exhibit some limitations of the ten groups that were allocated a foraging response to structural complexity table 4 eight ended the simulation with plausible biomasses in run 4 ecoengineer plugin the two groups that did not were the periwinkle a knysnaensis and the algae ulva spp in sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 it was noted that a knysnaensis responded favourably to the domination of zone 3a by b glandula sheltering in empty tests or between live barnacles so it was assumed that it would respond positively to the complexity created by b glandula relative to that of bare rocks a similar association exists in hong kong where the periwinkles echinolittorina malaccana and e vidua make use of microhabitats formed by the acorn barnacle tetraclita japonica particularly in summer cartwright and williams 2012 therefore a knysnaensis was assigned a moderate increase in foraging success in response to structural complexity in the present study which created a greater than plausible biomass of a knysnaensis in 2015 this is most likely because in the spatial model a knysnaensis would also possibly erroneously have reacted positively to the even greater complexity created by the aliens m galloprovincialis and s algosus which dominated in zones lower on the shore than those occupied by a knysnaensis in the case of ulva spp the model increase in biomass in response to structural complexity could have been exaggerated by the unexpected increase of b glandula and s algosus in the top shore fig 5 both of which contribute to the decrease in ulva spp s prey vulnerability by increasing secondary substrate the four other groups that also experienced an unrealistic response to structural complexity were the gull l dominicanus the fish clinidae and gobiidae and both plankton groups these groups however were not well parameterized because they were not measured on marcus island and as such were overestimated at the end of the simulation when the model was still not spatially explicit table 6 lastly the addition of effects of wave action which acted as fishing fleets that removed specified amounts of biomass from the lower zones of the shore surprisingly yielded minimal effects which is probably an unrealistic outcome a further extension of ecospace specific to intertidal rocky shore modelling might be required in which waves can remove individuals at a rate determined by their zonation and susceptibility to wave action it is recognised that the absolute spatial model results are dependant on both the dispersal and habitat preferences assigned for each functional group as mentioned earlier these were based on our best understanding of the functional groups in the marcus island ecosystem and used to generate a series of possible spatial outcomes that could be compared against one another given the comparative nature of the study to assess most appropriate ways of capturing spatial impacts of invasive alien ecosystem engineers an extensive sensitivity test of these two input parameters was not conducted the success of the ecoengineer plug in steenbeek and sadchatheeswaran 2021 was mainly dependant on the efficacy of the blender interstitial volume method utilized in sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 described in sadchatheeswaran et al 2019a and verified in sadchatheeswaran et al 2019b this 3d graphic modelling method allowed the direct measurement of structural complexity the maximum volume of space available for other organisms to occupy created by ecosystem engineers as it was virtual structural complexity could easily be calculated table b4 for each ecosystem engineer and then combined for all ecosystem engineers in the first step of the ecoengineer plug in steenbeek and sadchatheeswaran 2021 three dimensional modelling is a familiar tool for industry artists video game designers engineers and architects but in this study it made possible the combination of quantitatively determined complexity with spatiotemporal modelling other marine scientists have also found productive uses for 3d modelling one example of which is the hydrous project which create 3d replicas of corals to visualize in real time the impacts of various factors including disease and bleaching on coral reefs medlock 2015 nuwer 2015 woolsey and hall 2016 mings 2017 with further development ecoengineer could potentially test the efficacy of similar artificial reef projects while expanding ecosystem impact analysis for coastal development projects that have already been explored in ecospace such as that reported by the port of metro vancouver 2015 5 conclusion in this study an ecopath with ecosim model was used to build a spatially explicit credible small scale intertidal model of marcus island from 1980 pre invasion by three alien species to 2015 post invasion the model incorporated depth and habitat preferences affecting multiple functional groups as observed in sadchatheeswaran et al 2018 and included quantitative properties of structural complexity demonstrated in sadchatheeswaran et al 2015 2019b specifically it addresses the limitations of intertidal modelling that emerged in the prequel to this paper sadchatheeswaran et al 2020 namely the absence of an spatial analysis the application of a novel plug in for ecospace ecoengineer introduced structural complexity as a function of ecosystem engineer biomass ecoengineer allowed direct non trophic quantitative relationships to be defined between the alien ecosystem engineers and several important native groups in the model by providing spatial explicitness in the form of habitat and depth preferences the study also addresses zonation and competition for space even without wave action the trajectories of most of the biomasses of the modelled functional groups on marcus island from 1980 to 2015 mimicked reality i e empirical values measured during monitoring studies ecoengineer yielded not only realistic predictions of the biomass of most of the functional groups incorporated in the model but also produced insights into the likely mechanisms of interactions we believe it offers the most effective and user friendly means of modelling dynamic spatially organised benthic systems

24554,one possible explanation for the prevalence of sexual reproduction in animal species is that in the context of predator prey dynamics sexually reproducing prey are better able to evade predators than their asexual counterparts this is known as the red tooth hypothesis a term coined by french 2010 it is a special case of the more generic red queen hypothesis which explains the prevalence of sex not only in terms of advantages to prey but also in terms of advantages to hosts in the face of pathogens based on the assumption that pathogen host and predator prey dynamics are analogous in this study we test the red tooth hypothesis using individual based computer modeling simulations where additional predators are introduced during the simulation process for sexual asexual and facultative species our results indicate that after the introduction of increased predation sexual species have significantly higher escape ratios vs their asexual counterparts explainable by the higher energy levels of sexual prey vs asexual prey however there is a significant decrease in population levels of sexual prey vs asexual prey this lower population level of sexual prey may be explainable by the fact that sexual and asexual prey evolve different strategies in response to increased predation whereas sexual prey evolve higher energy levels and hence greater body size with a higher ratio of escape behaviors requiring more food which limits population size asexual prey remain smaller requiring less food and with a lower ratio of escape behaviors but with an increased ratio of successful reproductive attempts resulting in larger populations an additional factor in lower population levels of sexual prey is a higher kill ratio possibly due to vulnerability related to mating moreover we found that in experimental runs the species extinction ratio was noticeably lower for sexual vs asexual prey after the 15 000th time step following increased predation albeit below the threshold of statistical significance our results show that sexual reproduction may be selected in predator prey systems given the lower rate of species extinction in support of the red tooth hypothesis keywords predator prey dynamics red queen hypothesis red tooth hypothesis sexual species asexual species facultative species 1 introduction there has been much discussion in the literature regarding the role played by the red queen effect in helping to explain the prevalence of sexual reproduction in animal species the majority of articles in the recent literature on this topic focus on the red queen hypothesis rq for parasites the red queen hypothesis for parasites predicts that hosts and parasites will co evolve such that sex is naturally selected in the host species morran et al 2011 however a handful of recent researchers have returned their attention to the maintenance of sex in predator prey relations which french calls the red tooth rt hypothesis french 2010 this article will focus on the red tooth version of the red queen hypothesis what follows is a brief overview of the red queen hypothesis for parasites and its relation to the red tooth hypothesis followed by a discussion of empirical and simulation studies relevant to rt the purpose of our simulation study is to contribute to the ongoing debate regarding the veracity of rt brief overview of the red queen hypothesis much of the recent literature corroborates the rq hypothesis as an explanation of the prevalence of sex including empirical studies by jokela et al 2009 king et al 2009 king et al 2011 mee and rowe 2006 morran et al 2011 singh et al 2015 kumpulainen et al 2004 vergara et al 2014 wolinska and spaak 2009 michiels et al 2001 hakoyama et al 2001 and ellison et al 2011 salathe et al 2008 using a deterministic simulation model found that even low levels of parasites caused an increased rate of recombination in the hosts however not all studies corroborate rq according to duncan et al 2006 sex tended to inhibit resistance to parasites in species of daphnia tobbler and schlupp 2004 report that there was no difference in parasite loads between the sexual species poecilia latipinna and its close asexual relative poecilia formosa in four mixed sympatric populations killick et al 2008 found that parasite prevalence does not select for sexual reproduction in daphnia pulex morin 2008 reports that a eukaryotic alga eimiliana huxleyi is more vulnerable to viral parasites in its diploid phase when the organism reproduces sexually ben ami and heller 2005 and ben ami and heller 2007 found that there was no significant correlation between male frequency and parasite frequencies in the aquatic snail melanoides tuberculata finally agrawal 2009 using computer simulations found that the presence of parasites alone were not sufficient to select for sex or recombination the relation of the red queen hypothesis to the red tooth hypothesis raffel et al 2008 as well as kortet et al 2010 observe that there is a long standing tendency to regard predator prey interactions and parasite host interactions as analogous with the roots of this view in the earlier work of anderson and may 1978 although there are important parallels between predator prey and parasite host dynamics including co evolution of species the analogy is not perfect raffel et al 2008 for example predators consume all or some of their prey whereas parasites depend on the continued existence of the host raffel et al 2008 parasitoids parasites that may eventually kill their host in some cases induce their host to evade predators to ensure their survival grossman et al 2008 in addition whereas predator prey interactions are short lived parasite host interactions tend to endure longer labandeira 2002 raffel et al 2008 regardless raffel et al 2008 argue that much can be gained in terms of understanding both types of dynamics by pushing the parallels red tooth hypothesis relating to predation as was argued by magnhagen 1991 a major cost of sexual reproduction is vulnerability to predation while mating however a recent study by moller et al 2011 suggests that the costs of sex in terms of vulnerability to predation is not as great as once supposed in studying 80 species of birds the authors found that although dichromatic species appeared to be more vulnerable to predation than monochromatic species dichromatic individuals had evolved shorter alarm calls and increased tonic immobility thereby reducing their risk of being killed by predators during mating moller et al 2011 moreover a number of recent empirical studies have tended to corroborate the view that sexual reproduction confers an unmistakable advantage to prey species in the face of predation mee et al 2011 studied three fish species across 4 lakes such that sexually reproducing parents from different species produce hybrid offspring that reproduce asexually the authors found that the asexual hybrid offspring were not able to swim as fast as their sexually reproducing parents which suggests that the offspring did not gain the advantages of hybrid vigor mee et al 2011 the authors suggest that the lack of hybrid vigor of the asexual offspring likely explains the co existence of sexual and asexual species in sympatry mee et al 2011 further hotchkin and riveroll 2005 studied three species of whiptail lizard two that reproduced by parthenogenesis and one that reproduced sexually the authors found that there was a significant difference in terms of how close the asexual species allowed predators to approach vs the sexual species hotchkin and riveroll 2005 the asexual species allowed predators to approach more closely vs the sexual species which points to a possible benefit of sex hotchkin and riveroll 2005 also the sexual species a tigris fled further than the asexual species although the difference was not statistically significant hotchkin and riveroll 2005 in a more recent study koch and becks 2017 report that algae with facultative sexual reproduction had reduced fitness compared to their obligatively sexually reproducing counterparts since the facultative species had to bear the costs of both sexual and asexual reproduction they also found that sexually reproducing individuals produced superior offspring in terms of growth and defense vs their asexual counterparts koch and becks 2017 haafke et al 2016 report that rotifer predators algae prey evolved to higher levels of sexual reproduction as a response to evolution in their prey in unstable environments whereas rotifers in constant environments tended to evolve lower levels of sexual reproduction finally french 2009 conducted a computer simulation where predators are modeled by neural networks that can learn escape patterns of prey and prey that reproduce sexually with recombination is modeled by a number of escape genes if the escape pattern of the prey is consistent then it is learnable by predators however over time the prey genes evolve into random escape patterns that are not learnable by predators thereby suggesting an advantage of sexual reproduction significance and purpose of the study the purpose of this study is to contribute to the ongoing discussion regarding the tenability of the red tooth hypothesis using individual based modeling computer simulations a significant gain of our individual based modeling study over top down simulation studies is that in our model natural selection is an emergent process that results from the interaction of individuals as to opposed to being pre determined see gras et al 2015 this results in a more realistic account of what happens in both sexual and asexual populations in the presence of predation and pathogens in our simulations we introduce predators in three types of populations at the 15 000th time step obligative sexual obligative asexual and facultative sexual asexual to determine whether sex confers any advantage in the presence of predators in this study we are testing the following hypotheses hypothesis 1 if there is a higher rate of predation there will be a greater ratio of escape behaviors for sexual vs asexual species hypothesis 2 if there is a higher rate of predation there will be a decrease in population for asexual species whereas populations for sexual species will remain stable or increase hypothesis 3 if there is a higher rate of predation there will be a decrease in turnover rate for sexual vs asexual prey species these hypotheses are related in the following sense in the presence of higher predation rates a higher number of escape actions in the presence of predation vs asexual species if successful could contribute to a stabilization or an increase in populations of sexual species due to evasion of predators further a higher ratio of escape actions for sexual prey species could contribute to a lower rate of species turnover for sexual prey species once again connected with predator evasion at the same time hypothesis 2 and hypothesis 3 are to an extent independent of one another in the sense that although population levels of a given species are a factor in extinction rate other factors can offset the effect of population size on extinction such as resource availability genetic variability and low intra specific competition 2 methods the methods are arranged as follows we first provide an overview of the study in section 2 1 we then describe the essentials of ecosim which is the individual based model used in this study in section 2 2 for more details on ecosim see our odd in the supplementary material which follows the protocol outlined in grimm et al 2006 grimm et al 2010 and updated in grimm et al 2020 a protocol followed in other articles using individual based models such as dur et al 2021 next we discuss modifications made to the standard variant of ecosim in order to create asexual and facultative variants in section 2 3 sections 2 2 and 2 3 are directly from macpherson et al 2021 as those parts of the methods are exactly the same as in that previous study in section 2 4 we then describe how the red tooth hypothesis was tested by artificially increasing predator pressure in a set of ecosim runs finally we describe the methods we used to analyze our data and test our hypotheses in section 2 5 2 1 overview for this study we used ecosim a paradigmatic individual based predator prey ecosystem simulation with evolution and speciation ecosim is open source and available at https github com ecosimibm before we detail the essentials of the simulation we first provide a brief overview of the ecosim variants used in this study the standard variant of ecosim has a complex and dynamic world in which sexual prey and predator individuals interact given the complexity of ecosim simulations runs may not stabilize now matter how many time steps they involve we used this standard variant of ecosim sr for runs containing sexually reproducing prey individuals for comparisons surrounding the red tooth hypothesis in this study we produced two other variants of ecosim one with asexual prey and one with facultatively asexual prey hereby abbreviated ar and fr respectively predator individuals reproduced sexually in all ecosim variants the sr ar and fr variants served as control runs to test the red tooth hypothesis we developed modifications to ecosim such that after 15 000 time steps the number of predator individuals is artificially increased via duplication of some randomly selected predators the choice of 15 000 time steps to introduce increased predation is to allow the runs to stabilize and to contrast any difference between the subsequent time steps vs the initial 15 000 time steps where there were normal levels of predation we created three such new ecosim variants one in which prey reproduced sexually another asexually and another facultatively hereby abbreviated srp arp and frp respectively our aim was to compare srp arp and frp runs against the sr ar and fr runs in order to observe differences in key features that may provide an advantage to sexual reproduction during abrupt and drastic changes in predator pressure such drastic changes can occur in nature as is evidenced in golwaska and golwask 2019 who report that drastic changes in predation on insects from the red backed shrike lanius coburio as a result of prolonged rainfall in temperate regions of poland according to our hypotheses prey individuals reproducing sexually those in srp runs should possess a greater capacity to evade from predators compared to those reproducing asexually arp further we expected that in the arp runs there will be a stronger relative decrease in number of prey individuals when predation is increased when compared to srp runs we ran fifteen simulations each of the sr ar fr srp arp and frp variants of ecosim table 1 each of these replicates was defined in terms of having the same initialization in terms of parameters such as the initial number of prey predators grass and so forth as every other simulation see our odd in the supplementary material for further details that fifteen simulations were sufficient to stabilize the variability of the output variables is evidenced by the fact that the output variables of the control runs in this study were similar to the outputs in the control runs of other simulation studies of ecosim where output was stabilized such as macpherson et al 2021 if this had not been the case we would have increased the number of parallel runs we compared the raw outputs of the simulations including proportion of populations evading proportion of populations killed by predators and number of individuals in the simulations 2 2 ecosim we now discuss specifics of the standard configuration of ecosim relevant to the current study see supplementary for an odd description grimm et al 2010 scott et al 2018 scott and gras 2020 for this study the standard configuration was used for sr runs ecosim summarized in fig 1 is spatially explicit and time discrete see process overview and scheduling in supplementary material in ecosim individuals have limited energy reserves which they manage via the actions they perform every time step see submodels in supplementary material individuals increase their energy levels by eating or hunting while all other actions spend energy individuals in ecosim are typed as either prey or predators prey can only eat ecosim s primary resource grass while predators can hunt live prey or the remains of deceased prey meat grass and meat are subject to basic diffusion and decay models see submodels in supplementary material respectively while prey and predator actions are governed by more complex physical and behavioural models described below and elaborated upon under adaptation in supplementary material prey and predators can also influence the primary resource by passively producing fertilizer which improves grass growth rates locally the atomic unit of space is the cell a cell can contain any number of individuals of either type a limited amount of grass a limited amount of meat and a limited amount of fertilizer the atomic unit of time is the time step in which among many housekeeping and output functions all individuals perceive their local environment all individuals select an action using their behavioral model all individuals execute the selected action and resource diffusion and decay occurs ecosim takes place in a 1000 1000 torus world and lasts typically tens of thousands of time steps ecosim has the capacity to handle hundreds of thousands of individuals at any time step and these individuals can interact with each other and their environment in many ways individuals in ecosim have a two part genome one part influences the behaviours of the individual behavioural genome and the other governs its physical properties physical genome the genome is heritable and mutable but fixed throughout an individual s lifetime specifically for its behavioural model each individual has their own fuzzy cognitive map fcm kosko 1986 which is a directed graph in which nodes represent the stimulation of various concepts and each arc represents how the stimulation of its origin concept influences that of its target fcm concepts are classified as perception such as friendclose or foodfar internal such as hunger or curiosity or action such as eat or reproduce each node holds a floating point value between 0 and 1 representing the activation level of the represented concept the set of perceptions internal states and behaviours an individual has is specific to its type many concepts are shared across the two types but several are not e g both prey and predators have explore behaviour but only predators have hunt fcm arc values are coded in the individual s behavioural genome as an array of byte values that are mapped to floating point values ranging from 12 7 to 12 8 inclusive the byte representations are used for efficient storage and saving to files while the floating point values are used for computation at each time step and for each individual to compute the stimulation of perceptual nodes raw inputs from the individual s local environment such as friendclose or foodfar and vital states such as energylow or agehigh are fuzzified into perceptual concept activation levels that is the exact values of these input and states are converted to fuzzy values which is a range of continuous values kayacan and kanesar 2015 subsequently internal concept activation levels are computed as a weighted sum of all incident arc values taken from the behavioural genome multiplied by their respective origin activation levels finally action concept activation levels are computed the same way as those of the internal concepts the action that the individual performs at each time step is that with the highest corresponding activation level hence the behavioural genome directly influences individual viability and fecundity the physical genome also directly influences individual viability and fecundity the physical genome is an array of byte values that are mapped to floating point values and the mapping depends on the represented physical trait for instance maxenergy is the physical trait that is analogous to the size of the individual and limits how much energy the individual can hold vision is the physical trait that represents how far the individual can see in number of cells which directly influences how its perceptual concepts are activated each time step the range of maxenergy is 100 6475 while vision ranges from 1 to 25 individuals interact with others and their environment by selecting and performing an action every time step and this decision is influenced by the individual s state and physical characteristics particularly important actions are eat and reproduce though all actions tend to see some usage well adapted individuals will use energy more efficiently and will consequently survive longer and reproduce more often individuals that use energy wastefully will typically reproduce less and die earlier as the genomes are heritable and directly impact an individual s fitness evolution of gene pools in ecosim operates via natural selection there is no predefined fitness function gras et al 2015 physical and behavioural characteristics of individuals do not only affect energy of individuals via their interactions each individual in ecosim has a metabolic rate that is computed every time step and incorporates all of its evolving characteristics and some of its dynamic state information denoted energyspent in the equation for prey shown in eq 1 in this equation we incorporated all potential contributory factors so as to model energy expenditure as realistically as possible the size of an organism influences its metabolic rate chapman and reiss 1999 in ecosim maxenergy is the proxy for the size of an organism directly modelling the maximum amount of energy that the individual can store we use a ¬æ scaling exponent along with a tuning constant on maxenergy and other heritable physical characteristics e g vision maxspeed as there is a nonlinear relationship between animal body mass and metabolic rate kleiber 1932 hemmingsen 1960 kleiber 1961 in addition strength is a slightly more complex feature relating individual size maxenergy current age maximumage the individual cannot live longer than this value repage the age at which the individual is able to reproduce and current energy to its ability to perform actions see individuals under section entities state variables and scales in supplementary material for the algorithm to compute strength we relate this to energy expenditure through the kinetic energy equation lastly we relate the complexity of the individual s behavioural model fcm to its metabolic rate individuals with larger brains require more energy as the brain is expensive to operate in terms of chemical needs and thermoregulation wheeler 1984 falk 1990 safi et al 2005 the complexity of an individual s fcm a proxy for the size of the individual s brain is the number of nonzero arcs it has nbarcs which is also a heritable trait as these arc weights are inherited thus we also used a ¬æ scaling exponent along with a scaling constant on nbarcs to model metabolic requirement for brain upkeep in summary each component of the energy expenditure function which is an inherited behavioural or physical characteristic carries an associated cost which is the value of the trait multiplied or divided by some scaling constant to an exponent values provided in table 2 the energy an individual possesses is reduced by energyspent every time step see the equation used to calculate energyspent in the calculation section below by default individuals in ecosim reproduce via sexual reproduction every individual is either male or female and this is decided upon at the individual s birth and is fixed for the individual s entire lifetime reproduction is the only action that requires coordination between two individuals one male and one female individuals act in order of decreasing strength a proxy of the individual s overall quality which combines energy and age which means that stronger individuals get first preference for mates and resources this feature of our simulation is validated by an empirical study conducted by rueger gardiner and jones 2016 in which the authors found that coral reef cardinalfish sphaeramia nematoptera tend to choose larger mates as foote and larkin 1987 argue relative strength can be measured in terms of size so that size is a stand in for strength thus larger sized stronger individuals are chosen more often than smaller weaker individuals further foote and larkin 1988 report that in the case of sockeye salmon fish oncorhynchus nerka stronger males tend to win intraspecific competition for mates in addition in ecosim sexual reproduction is initiated by females to emulate female choosiness this feature of ecosim is also validated by a number of empirical studies including gabor and halladay 1997 who found that female newts become increasingly choosy in sequential mating as well as ben ari 2000 who reports that females in various insect and bird species use cryptic choice in finding a partner when a female attempts to reproduce first their age is checked to ensure that they have reached reproductiveage and their energy is checked to ensure that they have enough energy to pass to their potential offspring the amount of energy required to reproduce is stateofbirth as a percentage of the individual s maxenergy which will be given to the newborn by each parent should reproduction succeed as previously mentioned reproductiveage stateofbirth and maxenergy are all encoded in the physical genome of each individual by default the female first randomly selects a male in the same cell and attempts reproduction if there is no male in the same cell or the female is unfit to attempt reproduce according to their age or energy reproduction fails and the female incurs no extra energy cost otherwise for a sexual reproduction attempt to succeed several checks must be passed that emulate the classical cost of sexual reproduction first the selected male must have not yet acted and their action selection must also be reproduce the male must also be older than the reproductiveage and have enough energy to reproduce subject to the same check as the female finally the genetic distance between the two individuals must be greater than some minimum genetic distance which is a parameter of ecosim if any single check fails the female attempts reproduction with another randomly selected male in the same cell until there are none left to attempt reproduction with the rationale behind this condition for sexual reproduction is that it mimics what happens in nature where some species of animals randomly select mates there are a number of animal species such as marine animals for which random selection is used to choose mates as discussed in bhattacharjee et al 2018 for every reproduction attempt that fails the female loses two energy if any individual selected reproduce but did not find a suitable mate by the end of the time step their action selection is set to reproducefail and they perform no other action during the time step if all checks succeed the reproduction event succeeds and the parents produce a new offspring the newborn then receives energy which is the sum of each parent s stateofbirth as a percentage of their respective maxenergy each parent loses their respective transmitted energy in addition to a loss equal to 5 of the transmitted energy this additional loss of energy equal to 5 represents the energy costs associated with locating a mate and the mating process itself these costs are discussed in daly 1978 as well in foley et al 2018 pertaining to the so called effort of reproduction the physical and behavioural genomes of a newborn individual are combinations of those of their parents see adaptation in supplementary material the physical genome and behavioural genome each have a specialized crossover operator that is used to recombine the parents associated genomes and subsequently a specialized mutation operator is applied to each genome to finalize the newborn s genome the sex of an individual is decided randomly with equal probability between male and female ecosim s behavioural genome allows epistasis in that genes can influence each other but not pleiotropy as each gene directly influences only one behavioural trait during recombination linkage of behavioural genes occurs as they are transmitted block by block that is for each node in the fcm the values of its output edges are all transmitted together for a selected parent for perception nodes to emulate sex linkage the selected parent is the same gender as the offspring for all other nodes the selected parent is randomly chosen in the physical genome there is no epistasis or pleiotropy and some sex linkage occurs during recombination maxenergy of an offspring for instance is a weighted average of that of its parents and the parent with the same sex as the offspring contributes five times more strongly than the other parent full sex linkage occurs with stateofbirth as that of an offspring is equal to that of the parent with the same sex for the other traits the average of the two parents is taken by the offspring after recombination mutation occurs genes of both the behavioural and physical genomes are subject to a basic mutation that occurs with 0 1 chance which slightly modifies the value of the gene insertion and deletion mutations are defined for only the behavioural genome with a 0 05 chance the insertion mutation occurs on fcm arcs that have a value of zero and it sets them to a small non zero value the deletion mutation on the other hand sets non zero edge values to zero effectively removing the relationship between two fcm concepts 2 3 asexual and facultative ecosim the ar and fr variants of ecosim introduce different reproduction mechanics to prey individuals to reflect asexual and facultative reproduction respectively this involves definition of a new reproduceasexual action for prey corresponding changes to the fcm to allow evolution of usage of the action and definition of the energy dynamics regarding asexual reproduction outside of these modifications described below and some minor but necessary changes to output saving and loading from files etc which have no bearing on the simulation itself the ar and fr variants are identical to sr ecosim the first step in modifying ecosim to model asexual reproduction was to create a reproduceasexual action and define its mechanics as previously mentioned when reproduce sexual reproduction occurs both the male and female individuals are subject to a series of checks for reproduceasexual this process becomes heavily simplified first the individual must be female and older than their repage to be eligible to perform reproduceasexual if that check succeeds the only other requirement is that the individual has enough energy similar to the energy requirement of reproduce that of reproduceasexual is based on the individual s stateofbirth as a percentage of their maxenergy in addition because there is only one parent this requirement is multiplied by 1 9 finally we multiply the requirement by 1 3 to impose a 30 energy loss penalty for reproduceasexual these penalties make biological sense carter et al 2012 found that with respect to asexually reproducing aphids a maximal amount of energy is devoted to the reproduction of asexual individuals for example average adult body mass a stand in for energy level in asexual genotypes was 0 59 mg 0 011 whereas the average adult body mass in sexual genotypes was 0 57 mg 0 010 if the female individual has enough energy reproduceasexual succeeds and a new offspring is produced this newborn individual receives energy from the parent equal to the above requirement omitting the 30 penalty and the parent loses the transmitted energy along with the 30 penalty in addition as with reproduce the parent loses an additional 5 of the total energy cost if the parent is male has not reached repage or does not meet the energy requirement reproduceasexual fails despite this penalty ar and fr variants yield stable populations with large numbers of prey individuals often comparable to or exceeding the numbers of prey observed in sr the variant the behavioural and physical genomes in reproduceasexual are not subject to crossover but they are subject to the same mutation mechanics as described for reproduce as with reproduce the sex of the offspring is determined randomly with equal probability to be male or female these new actions needed to be integrated into the behavioural model and behavioural genome of prey in order to be usable and evolvable in the ar variant prey individuals had their reproduce fcm node replaced with reproduceasexual in the fr variant prey individuals had both reproduce and reproduceasexual nodes in the fcm facultatively reproducing species have been found in nature for example shibata et al 2017 report that the green anaconda eunectes murinus engages in this mode of reproduction and additionally groot bruins and breeuwer 2003 found molecular evidence to support the claim that the burmese python python molurus bivittatus is facultatively parthenogenic the initialization of the prey fcm edges that is their behavioural genomes was slightly different between the three variants for the ar variant edges to reproduceasexual had the exact same weight as those to reproduce in the sr variant in the fr variant edges to reproduce were identical to those in the sr variant negative edges to reproduceasexual in the fr variant were also initialized the same as those to reproduce however we multiplied the initial value of positive edges to reproduceasexual by 0 75 the rationale for this difference in initialization is that we found for the fr variant that with a constant of 1 0 i e all edges to reproduce and reproduceasexual are identically initialized the individuals completely favoured reproduceasexual over reproduce after only about 100 time steps ecosim in the default configuration has a very stable environment and so we expected that asexual reproduction should generally be favoured our aim was to observe a system in which the capacity to asexually reproduce evolves that way in other configurations such as those with regular environmental fluctuation scott et al 2018 random environmental disturbances or increased predation we could observe an increase in how long it takes to evolve asexual reproduction or perhaps observe that it never evolves 2 4 artificially increasing predator pressure predator pressure was not artificially increased until time step 15 000 thus until then the srp arp and frp variants ran identically to the corresponding sr ar and fr variants to artificially increase predator pressure in the srp arp and frp variants we randomly sampled predator individuals alive at the current time step duplicated them and added the duplicates into the simulation all attributes dynamic e g energy fcm states etc and static e g sex fcm edge values etc were exactly copied from the selected predator individuals predator individuals could be selected for duplication any number of times as the number of predator and prey individuals varies strongly between the sexual asexual and facultative variants the number of predator duplicates to add was proportional to the number of prey individuals further so as to not shock the system and to elicit a potential evolutionary response to the increasing predator pressure we found it useful to slowly increase the number of duplicates over time go to section 3 calculations for details as to how the number of predator duplicates was calculated in all ecosim has many parameters that balance and stabilize the simulation table 2 summarizes key parameters of this study as ecosim is a large scale simulation parameters specific to this research were tested with a brief grid search and parameters were chosen that provide stability and fairness across the different run types parameters of control variants were tuned in other works scott et al 2018 2 5 data analysis at select time steps every 1000th time step starting at time step 1000 to effect a comparison between two ecosim graphs each data point of each graph being based on the average of 10 runs we performed a t test on the assumption that the data for all runs at a given time step would be distributed normally and given that t tests are robust with respect to normality violations as discussed in stonehouse and forester 2010 comparing the 10 runs determining each data point and then calculated the p values we then graphed the 1 p values using trendlines and superimposed this graph on the two ecosim graphs to illustrate when the graphs differ significantly to avoid the risk of a type i error we used a bonferroni correction for Œ± 0 05 where Œ±b 0 00178 so that a given t test is regarded as significant only if p 0 00178 where 1 p approaches 1 each t test provides us with a snapshot of graph differences at every 1000th time point 3 calculation the equation used to calculate energyspent discussed in the methods section 2 2 is as follows 1 e n e r g y s p e n t e n e r g y s c a l e r a r c s c a l e r a r c p e n a l t y s t r e n g t h s p e e d 2 k e s c a l e r m a x e n e r g y m e s c a l e r 0

g e 2 3 where arcpenalty nbarcs arcconstant 0 75 if nbarcs arcconstant arcpenalty 1 otherwise further in terms of increased predation outlined in section 2 3 of the methods section above the number of predator duplicates nd was calculated relative to time step t and number of prey nprey as follows 2 n d n p r e y t 15000 500000 the constant 15 000 was subtracted from t such that at time step 15 000 the number of predator duplicates was zero prior to that no predator duplication occurs the constant 500 000 was simply to scale the number of predator individuals the result is a linear increase in the proportion of the prey population by which to duplicate predators amounting to 1 over 5000 time steps 0 2 per 1000 time steps for example if at time step 20 000 there are 100 000 prey then 1000 predator duplicates would be added to the simulation 4 results and discussion 4 1 corroboration of the hypothesis that there is a higher escape ratio for sexual vs asexual species in the face of predation the results of our simulations for sexually asexually and facultatively reproducing species support the claim that sexually reproducing species have a higher escape ratio overall than asexually reproducing species as outlined in the odd in the supplementary material escape behavior involves the prey moving in a direction that is opposite to the barycenter of the 5 closest predators if no predators are present then escape behavior is simply random movement the escape ratio is the ratio of evasive movements relative to all behaviors such as reproduction and foraging the facultative species reproduce almost exclusively asexually before and after the introduction of additional predators and so these runs essentially reduce to the runs for asexually reproducing species this makes sense because in the control phase of the runs where resources are relatively stable and there are not high levels of predation sexual reproduction is not indicated as an adaptation after additional predation pressure is introduced this factor by itself may not be sufficient to increase the rate of sexual reproduction in facultative species as evidence that single factors may not be sufficient to give rise to and maintain sexual reproduction a number of authors have argued that a plurality of interacting factors may be necessary to explain the advent of sexual reproduction including cooper et al 2005 killick et al 2006 park et al 2010 and neiman et al 2017 however for both sexual and asexual populations the rate of escape from predators in the experimental runs is significantly higher than the rate of escape in the control runs after the 15000th time step when predation is increased see fig 2 however after the 15000th time step where predation is increased the rate of escape for sexual populations is significantly higher than the rate of escape for asexual populations which corroborates our first hypothesis that in times of heightened predation sexual species will exhibit a higher ratio of escape compared with asexual species see fig 3 there is a degree of validation in empirical studies regarding increased ratios of escape behavior in sexual species as noted above magnhagen 1991 argued that sexual species are more vulnerable to predation further this increased vulnerability may lead to higher ratios of escape behavior in sexual species in the face of higher predation a sexually dichromatic species of lizard sceloporus woodi when exposed to higher levels of predation exhibits an increased level of escape behavior orton and mcbrayer 2018 moller et al 2011 studied 80 species of free living birds that reproduce sexually finding that predation by cats felis catus and by goshawks accipiter gentilis acted as a selection pressure on escape behaviors the higher ratio of escape in sexual vs asexual populations in our simulations is explainable by the higher energy levels of individuals in sexual populations vs asexual populations in the face of predation the average energy level of individuals in sexual populations is significantly higher in the experimental runs with higher predation vs the control runs on the other hand although the average energy level is higher in individuals in asexual populations with increased predation vs control populations the difference is not statistically significant fig 4 a possible explanation for the significantly higher energy for sexual species in the face of predation vs the control runs is increased availability of food resources which is likely due to lower population levels for sexual vs asexual prey as discussed below the same explanation would apply to the non significantly higher energy body size for asexual species in the face of predation vs the control runs these explanations are in fact borne out by our data relating to the amount of grass between experimental vs control runs for both sexual and asexual species fig 5 in our individual based modeling platform ecosim energy is a stand in for body size so that the higher the energy of an individual the greater the body size scott et al 2019 there are a number of empirical studies that confirm the connection between body size energy and food resource availability wolverton et al 2015 found that the larger body size of white tail deer odocoileus virginianus at lower latitudes is explainable by higher food availability as well as a lowered intra specific competition along similar lines lake et al 2008 report that the body mass of emperor geese chen canagica is inversely related to inter specific competition and directly related to food availability yom tov and kjellander 2009 argue that higher food availability is a major contributor to greater body size in animals based on their study of the eurasian lynx lynx lynx moreover rode et al 2010 found that the body size of polar bears ursus maritimus decreased directly with a decrease in sea ice which in turn is positively correlated with level of nutrients in other words polar bear size decreased with a decrease in nutrients finally sheridan and bickford 2011 suggest that the body size of animals decreases as a function of climate change which in turn results in a decrease in nutrients and food resources even though there is significant gain in food resources for both sexual vs asexual species in the experimental vs the control runs one possible reason why there is a significant energy gain in the experimental runs of the sexual species vs the experimental runs of the asexual species is that there is a higher amount of grass in the sexual vs the asexual populationswith 3800 units of grass for sexual prey vs 3000 units of grass for asexual prey by the 2800th time step fig 6 this higher level of grass in the sexual vs the asexual populations could be the result of less intra specific competition between individuals in sexual populations which in turn may be due to lower populations in sexual populations the eventuality of lower population in sexual vs asexual species in the face of predation will be discussed in more detail immediately below gvosdik and smolinsky 2015 concluded that tadpoles and newt larvae with decreased intra specific competition for food resources have larger body sizes higher energy which in turn suggests that the population levels are lower for prey with larger body sizes vs prey with smaller body sizes 4 2 rebut of the hypothesis that in the face of predation population size of asexual species will decrease whereas the population size of sexual species will increase although the first hypothesis regarding escape ratios of sexual predators is corroborated by our simulation data our data also casts doubt on the second hypothesis under investigation in this study in the face of predation sexual populations will increase or stabilize whereas asexual populations will decrease even though one might expect that significantly higher escape ratios for sexual vs asexual populations would result in population increases for sexual species and decreases for asexual species due to differential kill ratios this expectation is not borne out by our data in fact according to our data the opposite is true inn the face of predation whereas populations for asexual species increase populations for sexual species decrease fig 7 population levels for sexual species in experimental runs are significantly lower than population levels for sexual species in control runs following the introduction of increased predation after the 15000th time step fig 7 moreover for sexual species after the 15000th time step there is a steady decrease in population levels for experimental runs whereas population levels for control runs remain relatively stable as will be discussed below these results suggest that for sexual prey with larger energy requirements as an evolutionary response to increased predation food resources are a population limiting factor and in addition that there is a higher kill ratio for sexual experimental vs sexual control runs see fig 8 which may be a result of costs due to mating conversely for asexual species population levels in experimental runs are higher than populations levels in control runs after the 15 000th time step albeit not significantly so as suggested below this is due to smaller body size for asexual prey with fewer escapes and higher rates of successful reproductive attempts 4 3 possible explanations for lower population levels for sexual vs asexual species in the face of higher predation it is clear from the above graphs that sexual vs asexual prey species evolve different techniques for dealing with higher predation whereas sexual species evolve larger body sizes and higher escape ratios to deal with increased predation after the 15 000th time step asexual species remain smaller with lower energy levels resulting in a lower ratio of escape behaviours but with a higher ratio of successful reproductive attempts as will be discussed below the result of having higher energy and hence a larger body size for sexual prey is that more food resources are required to sustain this energy this increased need for food and resultant intra specific competition for resources is a population limiting factor for sexual prey given the importance of resources in logistic population growth for example see sibly and hone 2002 and hopfenberg 2003 another plausible explanation for lower population levels for sexual vs asexual species in experimental runs is that the kill ratio for sexual species is higher than the kill ratio for asexual species which is supported by our data relating to kill ratio fig 7 the dead killed ratio is significantly higher for both sexual and asexual species in experimental runs vs control runs after the 15000th time step although it takes longer for the asexual runs to reach significance which would be expected given the increased rate of predation in experimental runs however the kill ratio for sexual species in experimental runs after the 17000th time step is significantly higher than the kill ratio for asexual species which in turn explains the decreasing population levels for sexual species fig 8 the question that remains is why higher escape ratios for sexual species vs asexual species in experimental runs would result in higher kill ratios for sexual vs asexual species one possible explanation is that the existence of higher escape ratios by itself does not entail that the escaping prey evade capture if their escape patterns are easily learnable by predators using computer simulations french 2009 found that sexual species that developed random escape patterns via recombination were better able to escape predators given that these escape patterns are not easily learnable by predators in other words the success of sexual prey in the face of predation was not the result of a higher escape ratio but rather it was the result of a less learnable escape pattern by predators we did not find this result in our simulations in general due to mating and mating behavior members of sexually reproducing species will be more vulnerable to predators vs asexual species as was discussed by magnhagen 1991 this could explain the higher kill ratios for sexual species despite higher escape ratios another possible factor affecting the decrease in population of sexual species in experimental runs is that there is a lower reproductive attempt ratio in sexual species due to their higher escape ratio according to our data see fig 9 although there is not a significant difference in reproductive attempt ratios there is in fact a significantly lower rate of successful reproductive attempts for sexual vs asexual species in experimental runs which may result in lower populations for sexual species in the face of higher predation and given the higher rate of escape for both sexual and asexual species as a likely response it is understandable that the ratio of reproductive attempts would decrease for both asexual and sexual species since there is more energy being diverted to escape as is evidenced in the left hand graph in fig 10 moreover even though the reproduction ratio remains higher for sexual species the discernable difference in this ratio between sexual vs asexual species after the 15 000th time step is not statistically significant what may partially explain the lower population levels for sexual vs asexual species after the 15 000th time step is that the successful reproductive attempt ratio for asexual species is significantly higher than this ratio for sexual species as is evidenced by the right hand graph in fig 10 this is understandable since even in the face of predation asexual individuals will have a higher rate of reproductive success than sexual individuals since there is no need to mate which can result in increased vulnerability to predators and hence a higher kill ratio 4 4 confirmation of the hypothesis that in the face of predation there will be a decrease in turnover rate for sexual vs asexual prey species although hypothesis 2 that sexual populations remain stable or high in the face of increased predation was not corroborated by our simulation data our data does provide some support for hypothesis 3 that in the face of increased predation sexual species have a lower rate of extinction vs asexual species in our study we found that the extinction rate for sexual species decreased after the introduction of higher rates of predation at the 15 000th time step whereas the extinction rate for asexual species increased slightly or remained the same following the 15 000th time step see fig 11 although these results are discernable they are below the level of statistical significance white et al 2014 argue that theoretical ecologists should not always rely on statistical significance to evaluate their simulation results rather than trying to find low p values argue white et al 2014 ecologists using simulation models should focus more on the magnitude of differences between results fig 11 below summarizes our results regarding higher predation and extinction even though the results are not statistically significant it is evident that after the 15 000th time step with increased predation whereas the extinction rate of sexual prey decreases the extinction rate for asexual species remains the same or perhaps even increases slightly the question that naturally arises is how is it possible for the extinction rate of sexual species to decrease with higher rates of predation even though their population also decreases significantly presumably low populations tend towards extinction due to stochastic effects as discussed in lande et al 2003 and in mashayekhi et al 2014 in that case one might expect that sexual species would have higher extinction rates in the face of higher predation vs asexual species given their lower populations however there are several factors that impinge on extinction rates besides low population size such as resource availability reproduction ratio and body size either large or small as discussed in owens and bennett 2000 and in mashayekhi et al 2014 it particular using machine learning mashayekhi et al 2014 have extracted a rule that suggests that when the kill ratio of predators is lower than some critical threshold value there is a higher chance of extinction the apparent explanation of this rule is that as populations decreases there are fewer individuals left to be hunted by predators mashayekhi et al 2014 our simulations support this explanation since even though kill ratios are higher for sexual prey in the face of higher predation there is at the same time a noticeably higher rate of hunt fail actions for predators hunting sexual prey vs asexual prey after the 15 000th time step with the qualification that these results like the results in fig 11 are not statistically significant one reason for this higher failure rate could be that it is harder for predators to find prey for food if there are fewer of them see fig 11 thus if the failure rate for hunting asexual prey is lower than the failure rate for hunting sexual prey it could be argued that over time asexual populations could tend towards extinction due to a lower failure rate of predator persecution 5 conclusion in our individual based modeling computer simulations sexual species had higher escape rates from predators than asexual species due to higher energy these results corroborate the hypothesis that in the face of higher predation sexual species will have higher escape ratios than asexual species however we found in our modeling that although sexual prey had higher escape ratios than asexual prey in the face of higher predation this does not translate into stable or higher population levels for sexual prey vs asexual prey we found that sexual and asexual prey evolve different traits for dealing with an increase in predation which in turn impinges on population levels whereas sexual prey evolved higher energy levels and larger body size resulting in a higher escape ratio asexual prey retained lower energy levels and retained smaller body size the greater need for food resources for the higher energy sexual prey is a population limiting factor which in part explains the lower population levels for sexual vs asexual prey other factors affecting the decrease in population of sexual species in the face of increased predation is the higher kill ratio due to vulnerability associated with mating along with a lower rate of successful reproductive attempts these results rebut the second hypothesis that sexual prey species will have higher populations than asexual species in the face of predation on the other hand the computer modeling work of french 2010 indicates that to the extent that escape behavior is important for evasion of predators ratio of escape behavior is less important than escape patterns that are less learnable by predators our study does not support french s learnability hypothesis although we did find that there is a discernable difference in extinction rates between sexual vs asexual prey in the face of high predation which implies that a possible advantage of sexual reproduction is lower species extinction rates these results are consistent with our results regarding population and kill ratios for sexual vs asexual prey since a case can be made that at lower population levels there are fewer prey to be killed vs asexual prey this explanation is supported in mashayekhi et al 2014 where it is argued that other factors besides low population can lead to species extinction author declaration funding no funding was received for this work

24554,one possible explanation for the prevalence of sexual reproduction in animal species is that in the context of predator prey dynamics sexually reproducing prey are better able to evade predators than their asexual counterparts this is known as the red tooth hypothesis a term coined by french 2010 it is a special case of the more generic red queen hypothesis which explains the prevalence of sex not only in terms of advantages to prey but also in terms of advantages to hosts in the face of pathogens based on the assumption that pathogen host and predator prey dynamics are analogous in this study we test the red tooth hypothesis using individual based computer modeling simulations where additional predators are introduced during the simulation process for sexual asexual and facultative species our results indicate that after the introduction of increased predation sexual species have significantly higher escape ratios vs their asexual counterparts explainable by the higher energy levels of sexual prey vs asexual prey however there is a significant decrease in population levels of sexual prey vs asexual prey this lower population level of sexual prey may be explainable by the fact that sexual and asexual prey evolve different strategies in response to increased predation whereas sexual prey evolve higher energy levels and hence greater body size with a higher ratio of escape behaviors requiring more food which limits population size asexual prey remain smaller requiring less food and with a lower ratio of escape behaviors but with an increased ratio of successful reproductive attempts resulting in larger populations an additional factor in lower population levels of sexual prey is a higher kill ratio possibly due to vulnerability related to mating moreover we found that in experimental runs the species extinction ratio was noticeably lower for sexual vs asexual prey after the 15 000th time step following increased predation albeit below the threshold of statistical significance our results show that sexual reproduction may be selected in predator prey systems given the lower rate of species extinction in support of the red tooth hypothesis keywords predator prey dynamics red queen hypothesis red tooth hypothesis sexual species asexual species facultative species 1 introduction there has been much discussion in the literature regarding the role played by the red queen effect in helping to explain the prevalence of sexual reproduction in animal species the majority of articles in the recent literature on this topic focus on the red queen hypothesis rq for parasites the red queen hypothesis for parasites predicts that hosts and parasites will co evolve such that sex is naturally selected in the host species morran et al 2011 however a handful of recent researchers have returned their attention to the maintenance of sex in predator prey relations which french calls the red tooth rt hypothesis french 2010 this article will focus on the red tooth version of the red queen hypothesis what follows is a brief overview of the red queen hypothesis for parasites and its relation to the red tooth hypothesis followed by a discussion of empirical and simulation studies relevant to rt the purpose of our simulation study is to contribute to the ongoing debate regarding the veracity of rt brief overview of the red queen hypothesis much of the recent literature corroborates the rq hypothesis as an explanation of the prevalence of sex including empirical studies by jokela et al 2009 king et al 2009 king et al 2011 mee and rowe 2006 morran et al 2011 singh et al 2015 kumpulainen et al 2004 vergara et al 2014 wolinska and spaak 2009 michiels et al 2001 hakoyama et al 2001 and ellison et al 2011 salathe et al 2008 using a deterministic simulation model found that even low levels of parasites caused an increased rate of recombination in the hosts however not all studies corroborate rq according to duncan et al 2006 sex tended to inhibit resistance to parasites in species of daphnia tobbler and schlupp 2004 report that there was no difference in parasite loads between the sexual species poecilia latipinna and its close asexual relative poecilia formosa in four mixed sympatric populations killick et al 2008 found that parasite prevalence does not select for sexual reproduction in daphnia pulex morin 2008 reports that a eukaryotic alga eimiliana huxleyi is more vulnerable to viral parasites in its diploid phase when the organism reproduces sexually ben ami and heller 2005 and ben ami and heller 2007 found that there was no significant correlation between male frequency and parasite frequencies in the aquatic snail melanoides tuberculata finally agrawal 2009 using computer simulations found that the presence of parasites alone were not sufficient to select for sex or recombination the relation of the red queen hypothesis to the red tooth hypothesis raffel et al 2008 as well as kortet et al 2010 observe that there is a long standing tendency to regard predator prey interactions and parasite host interactions as analogous with the roots of this view in the earlier work of anderson and may 1978 although there are important parallels between predator prey and parasite host dynamics including co evolution of species the analogy is not perfect raffel et al 2008 for example predators consume all or some of their prey whereas parasites depend on the continued existence of the host raffel et al 2008 parasitoids parasites that may eventually kill their host in some cases induce their host to evade predators to ensure their survival grossman et al 2008 in addition whereas predator prey interactions are short lived parasite host interactions tend to endure longer labandeira 2002 raffel et al 2008 regardless raffel et al 2008 argue that much can be gained in terms of understanding both types of dynamics by pushing the parallels red tooth hypothesis relating to predation as was argued by magnhagen 1991 a major cost of sexual reproduction is vulnerability to predation while mating however a recent study by moller et al 2011 suggests that the costs of sex in terms of vulnerability to predation is not as great as once supposed in studying 80 species of birds the authors found that although dichromatic species appeared to be more vulnerable to predation than monochromatic species dichromatic individuals had evolved shorter alarm calls and increased tonic immobility thereby reducing their risk of being killed by predators during mating moller et al 2011 moreover a number of recent empirical studies have tended to corroborate the view that sexual reproduction confers an unmistakable advantage to prey species in the face of predation mee et al 2011 studied three fish species across 4 lakes such that sexually reproducing parents from different species produce hybrid offspring that reproduce asexually the authors found that the asexual hybrid offspring were not able to swim as fast as their sexually reproducing parents which suggests that the offspring did not gain the advantages of hybrid vigor mee et al 2011 the authors suggest that the lack of hybrid vigor of the asexual offspring likely explains the co existence of sexual and asexual species in sympatry mee et al 2011 further hotchkin and riveroll 2005 studied three species of whiptail lizard two that reproduced by parthenogenesis and one that reproduced sexually the authors found that there was a significant difference in terms of how close the asexual species allowed predators to approach vs the sexual species hotchkin and riveroll 2005 the asexual species allowed predators to approach more closely vs the sexual species which points to a possible benefit of sex hotchkin and riveroll 2005 also the sexual species a tigris fled further than the asexual species although the difference was not statistically significant hotchkin and riveroll 2005 in a more recent study koch and becks 2017 report that algae with facultative sexual reproduction had reduced fitness compared to their obligatively sexually reproducing counterparts since the facultative species had to bear the costs of both sexual and asexual reproduction they also found that sexually reproducing individuals produced superior offspring in terms of growth and defense vs their asexual counterparts koch and becks 2017 haafke et al 2016 report that rotifer predators algae prey evolved to higher levels of sexual reproduction as a response to evolution in their prey in unstable environments whereas rotifers in constant environments tended to evolve lower levels of sexual reproduction finally french 2009 conducted a computer simulation where predators are modeled by neural networks that can learn escape patterns of prey and prey that reproduce sexually with recombination is modeled by a number of escape genes if the escape pattern of the prey is consistent then it is learnable by predators however over time the prey genes evolve into random escape patterns that are not learnable by predators thereby suggesting an advantage of sexual reproduction significance and purpose of the study the purpose of this study is to contribute to the ongoing discussion regarding the tenability of the red tooth hypothesis using individual based modeling computer simulations a significant gain of our individual based modeling study over top down simulation studies is that in our model natural selection is an emergent process that results from the interaction of individuals as to opposed to being pre determined see gras et al 2015 this results in a more realistic account of what happens in both sexual and asexual populations in the presence of predation and pathogens in our simulations we introduce predators in three types of populations at the 15 000th time step obligative sexual obligative asexual and facultative sexual asexual to determine whether sex confers any advantage in the presence of predators in this study we are testing the following hypotheses hypothesis 1 if there is a higher rate of predation there will be a greater ratio of escape behaviors for sexual vs asexual species hypothesis 2 if there is a higher rate of predation there will be a decrease in population for asexual species whereas populations for sexual species will remain stable or increase hypothesis 3 if there is a higher rate of predation there will be a decrease in turnover rate for sexual vs asexual prey species these hypotheses are related in the following sense in the presence of higher predation rates a higher number of escape actions in the presence of predation vs asexual species if successful could contribute to a stabilization or an increase in populations of sexual species due to evasion of predators further a higher ratio of escape actions for sexual prey species could contribute to a lower rate of species turnover for sexual prey species once again connected with predator evasion at the same time hypothesis 2 and hypothesis 3 are to an extent independent of one another in the sense that although population levels of a given species are a factor in extinction rate other factors can offset the effect of population size on extinction such as resource availability genetic variability and low intra specific competition 2 methods the methods are arranged as follows we first provide an overview of the study in section 2 1 we then describe the essentials of ecosim which is the individual based model used in this study in section 2 2 for more details on ecosim see our odd in the supplementary material which follows the protocol outlined in grimm et al 2006 grimm et al 2010 and updated in grimm et al 2020 a protocol followed in other articles using individual based models such as dur et al 2021 next we discuss modifications made to the standard variant of ecosim in order to create asexual and facultative variants in section 2 3 sections 2 2 and 2 3 are directly from macpherson et al 2021 as those parts of the methods are exactly the same as in that previous study in section 2 4 we then describe how the red tooth hypothesis was tested by artificially increasing predator pressure in a set of ecosim runs finally we describe the methods we used to analyze our data and test our hypotheses in section 2 5 2 1 overview for this study we used ecosim a paradigmatic individual based predator prey ecosystem simulation with evolution and speciation ecosim is open source and available at https github com ecosimibm before we detail the essentials of the simulation we first provide a brief overview of the ecosim variants used in this study the standard variant of ecosim has a complex and dynamic world in which sexual prey and predator individuals interact given the complexity of ecosim simulations runs may not stabilize now matter how many time steps they involve we used this standard variant of ecosim sr for runs containing sexually reproducing prey individuals for comparisons surrounding the red tooth hypothesis in this study we produced two other variants of ecosim one with asexual prey and one with facultatively asexual prey hereby abbreviated ar and fr respectively predator individuals reproduced sexually in all ecosim variants the sr ar and fr variants served as control runs to test the red tooth hypothesis we developed modifications to ecosim such that after 15 000 time steps the number of predator individuals is artificially increased via duplication of some randomly selected predators the choice of 15 000 time steps to introduce increased predation is to allow the runs to stabilize and to contrast any difference between the subsequent time steps vs the initial 15 000 time steps where there were normal levels of predation we created three such new ecosim variants one in which prey reproduced sexually another asexually and another facultatively hereby abbreviated srp arp and frp respectively our aim was to compare srp arp and frp runs against the sr ar and fr runs in order to observe differences in key features that may provide an advantage to sexual reproduction during abrupt and drastic changes in predator pressure such drastic changes can occur in nature as is evidenced in golwaska and golwask 2019 who report that drastic changes in predation on insects from the red backed shrike lanius coburio as a result of prolonged rainfall in temperate regions of poland according to our hypotheses prey individuals reproducing sexually those in srp runs should possess a greater capacity to evade from predators compared to those reproducing asexually arp further we expected that in the arp runs there will be a stronger relative decrease in number of prey individuals when predation is increased when compared to srp runs we ran fifteen simulations each of the sr ar fr srp arp and frp variants of ecosim table 1 each of these replicates was defined in terms of having the same initialization in terms of parameters such as the initial number of prey predators grass and so forth as every other simulation see our odd in the supplementary material for further details that fifteen simulations were sufficient to stabilize the variability of the output variables is evidenced by the fact that the output variables of the control runs in this study were similar to the outputs in the control runs of other simulation studies of ecosim where output was stabilized such as macpherson et al 2021 if this had not been the case we would have increased the number of parallel runs we compared the raw outputs of the simulations including proportion of populations evading proportion of populations killed by predators and number of individuals in the simulations 2 2 ecosim we now discuss specifics of the standard configuration of ecosim relevant to the current study see supplementary for an odd description grimm et al 2010 scott et al 2018 scott and gras 2020 for this study the standard configuration was used for sr runs ecosim summarized in fig 1 is spatially explicit and time discrete see process overview and scheduling in supplementary material in ecosim individuals have limited energy reserves which they manage via the actions they perform every time step see submodels in supplementary material individuals increase their energy levels by eating or hunting while all other actions spend energy individuals in ecosim are typed as either prey or predators prey can only eat ecosim s primary resource grass while predators can hunt live prey or the remains of deceased prey meat grass and meat are subject to basic diffusion and decay models see submodels in supplementary material respectively while prey and predator actions are governed by more complex physical and behavioural models described below and elaborated upon under adaptation in supplementary material prey and predators can also influence the primary resource by passively producing fertilizer which improves grass growth rates locally the atomic unit of space is the cell a cell can contain any number of individuals of either type a limited amount of grass a limited amount of meat and a limited amount of fertilizer the atomic unit of time is the time step in which among many housekeeping and output functions all individuals perceive their local environment all individuals select an action using their behavioral model all individuals execute the selected action and resource diffusion and decay occurs ecosim takes place in a 1000 1000 torus world and lasts typically tens of thousands of time steps ecosim has the capacity to handle hundreds of thousands of individuals at any time step and these individuals can interact with each other and their environment in many ways individuals in ecosim have a two part genome one part influences the behaviours of the individual behavioural genome and the other governs its physical properties physical genome the genome is heritable and mutable but fixed throughout an individual s lifetime specifically for its behavioural model each individual has their own fuzzy cognitive map fcm kosko 1986 which is a directed graph in which nodes represent the stimulation of various concepts and each arc represents how the stimulation of its origin concept influences that of its target fcm concepts are classified as perception such as friendclose or foodfar internal such as hunger or curiosity or action such as eat or reproduce each node holds a floating point value between 0 and 1 representing the activation level of the represented concept the set of perceptions internal states and behaviours an individual has is specific to its type many concepts are shared across the two types but several are not e g both prey and predators have explore behaviour but only predators have hunt fcm arc values are coded in the individual s behavioural genome as an array of byte values that are mapped to floating point values ranging from 12 7 to 12 8 inclusive the byte representations are used for efficient storage and saving to files while the floating point values are used for computation at each time step and for each individual to compute the stimulation of perceptual nodes raw inputs from the individual s local environment such as friendclose or foodfar and vital states such as energylow or agehigh are fuzzified into perceptual concept activation levels that is the exact values of these input and states are converted to fuzzy values which is a range of continuous values kayacan and kanesar 2015 subsequently internal concept activation levels are computed as a weighted sum of all incident arc values taken from the behavioural genome multiplied by their respective origin activation levels finally action concept activation levels are computed the same way as those of the internal concepts the action that the individual performs at each time step is that with the highest corresponding activation level hence the behavioural genome directly influences individual viability and fecundity the physical genome also directly influences individual viability and fecundity the physical genome is an array of byte values that are mapped to floating point values and the mapping depends on the represented physical trait for instance maxenergy is the physical trait that is analogous to the size of the individual and limits how much energy the individual can hold vision is the physical trait that represents how far the individual can see in number of cells which directly influences how its perceptual concepts are activated each time step the range of maxenergy is 100 6475 while vision ranges from 1 to 25 individuals interact with others and their environment by selecting and performing an action every time step and this decision is influenced by the individual s state and physical characteristics particularly important actions are eat and reproduce though all actions tend to see some usage well adapted individuals will use energy more efficiently and will consequently survive longer and reproduce more often individuals that use energy wastefully will typically reproduce less and die earlier as the genomes are heritable and directly impact an individual s fitness evolution of gene pools in ecosim operates via natural selection there is no predefined fitness function gras et al 2015 physical and behavioural characteristics of individuals do not only affect energy of individuals via their interactions each individual in ecosim has a metabolic rate that is computed every time step and incorporates all of its evolving characteristics and some of its dynamic state information denoted energyspent in the equation for prey shown in eq 1 in this equation we incorporated all potential contributory factors so as to model energy expenditure as realistically as possible the size of an organism influences its metabolic rate chapman and reiss 1999 in ecosim maxenergy is the proxy for the size of an organism directly modelling the maximum amount of energy that the individual can store we use a ¬æ scaling exponent along with a tuning constant on maxenergy and other heritable physical characteristics e g vision maxspeed as there is a nonlinear relationship between animal body mass and metabolic rate kleiber 1932 hemmingsen 1960 kleiber 1961 in addition strength is a slightly more complex feature relating individual size maxenergy current age maximumage the individual cannot live longer than this value repage the age at which the individual is able to reproduce and current energy to its ability to perform actions see individuals under section entities state variables and scales in supplementary material for the algorithm to compute strength we relate this to energy expenditure through the kinetic energy equation lastly we relate the complexity of the individual s behavioural model fcm to its metabolic rate individuals with larger brains require more energy as the brain is expensive to operate in terms of chemical needs and thermoregulation wheeler 1984 falk 1990 safi et al 2005 the complexity of an individual s fcm a proxy for the size of the individual s brain is the number of nonzero arcs it has nbarcs which is also a heritable trait as these arc weights are inherited thus we also used a ¬æ scaling exponent along with a scaling constant on nbarcs to model metabolic requirement for brain upkeep in summary each component of the energy expenditure function which is an inherited behavioural or physical characteristic carries an associated cost which is the value of the trait multiplied or divided by some scaling constant to an exponent values provided in table 2 the energy an individual possesses is reduced by energyspent every time step see the equation used to calculate energyspent in the calculation section below by default individuals in ecosim reproduce via sexual reproduction every individual is either male or female and this is decided upon at the individual s birth and is fixed for the individual s entire lifetime reproduction is the only action that requires coordination between two individuals one male and one female individuals act in order of decreasing strength a proxy of the individual s overall quality which combines energy and age which means that stronger individuals get first preference for mates and resources this feature of our simulation is validated by an empirical study conducted by rueger gardiner and jones 2016 in which the authors found that coral reef cardinalfish sphaeramia nematoptera tend to choose larger mates as foote and larkin 1987 argue relative strength can be measured in terms of size so that size is a stand in for strength thus larger sized stronger individuals are chosen more often than smaller weaker individuals further foote and larkin 1988 report that in the case of sockeye salmon fish oncorhynchus nerka stronger males tend to win intraspecific competition for mates in addition in ecosim sexual reproduction is initiated by females to emulate female choosiness this feature of ecosim is also validated by a number of empirical studies including gabor and halladay 1997 who found that female newts become increasingly choosy in sequential mating as well as ben ari 2000 who reports that females in various insect and bird species use cryptic choice in finding a partner when a female attempts to reproduce first their age is checked to ensure that they have reached reproductiveage and their energy is checked to ensure that they have enough energy to pass to their potential offspring the amount of energy required to reproduce is stateofbirth as a percentage of the individual s maxenergy which will be given to the newborn by each parent should reproduction succeed as previously mentioned reproductiveage stateofbirth and maxenergy are all encoded in the physical genome of each individual by default the female first randomly selects a male in the same cell and attempts reproduction if there is no male in the same cell or the female is unfit to attempt reproduce according to their age or energy reproduction fails and the female incurs no extra energy cost otherwise for a sexual reproduction attempt to succeed several checks must be passed that emulate the classical cost of sexual reproduction first the selected male must have not yet acted and their action selection must also be reproduce the male must also be older than the reproductiveage and have enough energy to reproduce subject to the same check as the female finally the genetic distance between the two individuals must be greater than some minimum genetic distance which is a parameter of ecosim if any single check fails the female attempts reproduction with another randomly selected male in the same cell until there are none left to attempt reproduction with the rationale behind this condition for sexual reproduction is that it mimics what happens in nature where some species of animals randomly select mates there are a number of animal species such as marine animals for which random selection is used to choose mates as discussed in bhattacharjee et al 2018 for every reproduction attempt that fails the female loses two energy if any individual selected reproduce but did not find a suitable mate by the end of the time step their action selection is set to reproducefail and they perform no other action during the time step if all checks succeed the reproduction event succeeds and the parents produce a new offspring the newborn then receives energy which is the sum of each parent s stateofbirth as a percentage of their respective maxenergy each parent loses their respective transmitted energy in addition to a loss equal to 5 of the transmitted energy this additional loss of energy equal to 5 represents the energy costs associated with locating a mate and the mating process itself these costs are discussed in daly 1978 as well in foley et al 2018 pertaining to the so called effort of reproduction the physical and behavioural genomes of a newborn individual are combinations of those of their parents see adaptation in supplementary material the physical genome and behavioural genome each have a specialized crossover operator that is used to recombine the parents associated genomes and subsequently a specialized mutation operator is applied to each genome to finalize the newborn s genome the sex of an individual is decided randomly with equal probability between male and female ecosim s behavioural genome allows epistasis in that genes can influence each other but not pleiotropy as each gene directly influences only one behavioural trait during recombination linkage of behavioural genes occurs as they are transmitted block by block that is for each node in the fcm the values of its output edges are all transmitted together for a selected parent for perception nodes to emulate sex linkage the selected parent is the same gender as the offspring for all other nodes the selected parent is randomly chosen in the physical genome there is no epistasis or pleiotropy and some sex linkage occurs during recombination maxenergy of an offspring for instance is a weighted average of that of its parents and the parent with the same sex as the offspring contributes five times more strongly than the other parent full sex linkage occurs with stateofbirth as that of an offspring is equal to that of the parent with the same sex for the other traits the average of the two parents is taken by the offspring after recombination mutation occurs genes of both the behavioural and physical genomes are subject to a basic mutation that occurs with 0 1 chance which slightly modifies the value of the gene insertion and deletion mutations are defined for only the behavioural genome with a 0 05 chance the insertion mutation occurs on fcm arcs that have a value of zero and it sets them to a small non zero value the deletion mutation on the other hand sets non zero edge values to zero effectively removing the relationship between two fcm concepts 2 3 asexual and facultative ecosim the ar and fr variants of ecosim introduce different reproduction mechanics to prey individuals to reflect asexual and facultative reproduction respectively this involves definition of a new reproduceasexual action for prey corresponding changes to the fcm to allow evolution of usage of the action and definition of the energy dynamics regarding asexual reproduction outside of these modifications described below and some minor but necessary changes to output saving and loading from files etc which have no bearing on the simulation itself the ar and fr variants are identical to sr ecosim the first step in modifying ecosim to model asexual reproduction was to create a reproduceasexual action and define its mechanics as previously mentioned when reproduce sexual reproduction occurs both the male and female individuals are subject to a series of checks for reproduceasexual this process becomes heavily simplified first the individual must be female and older than their repage to be eligible to perform reproduceasexual if that check succeeds the only other requirement is that the individual has enough energy similar to the energy requirement of reproduce that of reproduceasexual is based on the individual s stateofbirth as a percentage of their maxenergy in addition because there is only one parent this requirement is multiplied by 1 9 finally we multiply the requirement by 1 3 to impose a 30 energy loss penalty for reproduceasexual these penalties make biological sense carter et al 2012 found that with respect to asexually reproducing aphids a maximal amount of energy is devoted to the reproduction of asexual individuals for example average adult body mass a stand in for energy level in asexual genotypes was 0 59 mg 0 011 whereas the average adult body mass in sexual genotypes was 0 57 mg 0 010 if the female individual has enough energy reproduceasexual succeeds and a new offspring is produced this newborn individual receives energy from the parent equal to the above requirement omitting the 30 penalty and the parent loses the transmitted energy along with the 30 penalty in addition as with reproduce the parent loses an additional 5 of the total energy cost if the parent is male has not reached repage or does not meet the energy requirement reproduceasexual fails despite this penalty ar and fr variants yield stable populations with large numbers of prey individuals often comparable to or exceeding the numbers of prey observed in sr the variant the behavioural and physical genomes in reproduceasexual are not subject to crossover but they are subject to the same mutation mechanics as described for reproduce as with reproduce the sex of the offspring is determined randomly with equal probability to be male or female these new actions needed to be integrated into the behavioural model and behavioural genome of prey in order to be usable and evolvable in the ar variant prey individuals had their reproduce fcm node replaced with reproduceasexual in the fr variant prey individuals had both reproduce and reproduceasexual nodes in the fcm facultatively reproducing species have been found in nature for example shibata et al 2017 report that the green anaconda eunectes murinus engages in this mode of reproduction and additionally groot bruins and breeuwer 2003 found molecular evidence to support the claim that the burmese python python molurus bivittatus is facultatively parthenogenic the initialization of the prey fcm edges that is their behavioural genomes was slightly different between the three variants for the ar variant edges to reproduceasexual had the exact same weight as those to reproduce in the sr variant in the fr variant edges to reproduce were identical to those in the sr variant negative edges to reproduceasexual in the fr variant were also initialized the same as those to reproduce however we multiplied the initial value of positive edges to reproduceasexual by 0 75 the rationale for this difference in initialization is that we found for the fr variant that with a constant of 1 0 i e all edges to reproduce and reproduceasexual are identically initialized the individuals completely favoured reproduceasexual over reproduce after only about 100 time steps ecosim in the default configuration has a very stable environment and so we expected that asexual reproduction should generally be favoured our aim was to observe a system in which the capacity to asexually reproduce evolves that way in other configurations such as those with regular environmental fluctuation scott et al 2018 random environmental disturbances or increased predation we could observe an increase in how long it takes to evolve asexual reproduction or perhaps observe that it never evolves 2 4 artificially increasing predator pressure predator pressure was not artificially increased until time step 15 000 thus until then the srp arp and frp variants ran identically to the corresponding sr ar and fr variants to artificially increase predator pressure in the srp arp and frp variants we randomly sampled predator individuals alive at the current time step duplicated them and added the duplicates into the simulation all attributes dynamic e g energy fcm states etc and static e g sex fcm edge values etc were exactly copied from the selected predator individuals predator individuals could be selected for duplication any number of times as the number of predator and prey individuals varies strongly between the sexual asexual and facultative variants the number of predator duplicates to add was proportional to the number of prey individuals further so as to not shock the system and to elicit a potential evolutionary response to the increasing predator pressure we found it useful to slowly increase the number of duplicates over time go to section 3 calculations for details as to how the number of predator duplicates was calculated in all ecosim has many parameters that balance and stabilize the simulation table 2 summarizes key parameters of this study as ecosim is a large scale simulation parameters specific to this research were tested with a brief grid search and parameters were chosen that provide stability and fairness across the different run types parameters of control variants were tuned in other works scott et al 2018 2 5 data analysis at select time steps every 1000th time step starting at time step 1000 to effect a comparison between two ecosim graphs each data point of each graph being based on the average of 10 runs we performed a t test on the assumption that the data for all runs at a given time step would be distributed normally and given that t tests are robust with respect to normality violations as discussed in stonehouse and forester 2010 comparing the 10 runs determining each data point and then calculated the p values we then graphed the 1 p values using trendlines and superimposed this graph on the two ecosim graphs to illustrate when the graphs differ significantly to avoid the risk of a type i error we used a bonferroni correction for Œ± 0 05 where Œ±b 0 00178 so that a given t test is regarded as significant only if p 0 00178 where 1 p approaches 1 each t test provides us with a snapshot of graph differences at every 1000th time point 3 calculation the equation used to calculate energyspent discussed in the

predator duplicates nd was calculated relative to time step t and number of prey nprey as follows 2 n d n p r e y t 15000 500000 the constant 15 000 was subtracted from t such that at time step 15 000 the number of predator duplicates was zero prior to that no predator duplication occurs the constant 500 000 was simply to scale the number of predator individuals the result is a linear increase in the proportion of the prey population by which to duplicate predators amounting to 1 over 5000 time steps 0 2 per 1000 time steps for example if at time step 20 000 there are 100 000 prey then 1000 predator duplicates would be added to the simulation 4 results and discussion 4 1 corroboration of the hypothesis that there is a higher escape ratio for sexual vs asexual species in the face of predation the results of our simulations for sexually asexually and facultatively reproducing species support the claim that sexually reproducing species have a higher escape ratio overall than asexually reproducing species as outlined in the odd in the supplementary material escape behavior involves the prey moving in a direction that is opposite to the barycenter of the 5 closest predators if no predators are present then escape behavior is simply random movement the escape ratio is the ratio of evasive movements relative to all behaviors such as reproduction and foraging the facultative species reproduce almost exclusively asexually before and after the introduction of additional predators and so these runs essentially reduce to the runs for asexually reproducing species this makes sense because in the control phase of the runs where resources are relatively stable and there are not high levels of predation sexual reproduction is not indicated as an adaptation after additional predation pressure is introduced this factor by itself may not be sufficient to increase the rate of sexual reproduction in facultative species as evidence that single factors may not be sufficient to give rise to and maintain sexual reproduction a number of authors have argued that a plurality of interacting factors may be necessary to explain the advent of sexual reproduction including cooper et al 2005 killick et al 2006 park et al 2010 and neiman et al 2017 however for both sexual and asexual populations the rate of escape from predators in the experimental runs is significantly higher than the rate of escape in the control runs after the 15000th time step when predation is increased see fig 2 however after the 15000th time step where predation is increased the rate of escape for sexual populations is significantly higher than the rate of escape for asexual populations which corroborates our first hypothesis that in times of heightened predation sexual species will exhibit a higher ratio of escape compared with asexual species see fig 3 there is a degree of validation in empirical studies regarding increased ratios of escape behavior in sexual species as noted above magnhagen 1991 argued that sexual species are more vulnerable to predation further this increased vulnerability may lead to higher ratios of escape behavior in sexual species in the face of higher predation a sexually dichromatic species of lizard sceloporus woodi when exposed to higher levels of predation exhibits an increased level of escape behavior orton and mcbrayer 2018 moller et al 2011 studied 80 species of free living birds that reproduce sexually finding that predation by cats felis catus and by goshawks accipiter gentilis acted as a selection pressure on escape behaviors the higher ratio of escape in sexual vs asexual populations in our simulations is explainable by the higher energy levels of individuals in sexual populations vs asexual populations in the face of predation the average energy level of individuals in sexual populations is significantly higher in the experimental runs with higher predation vs the control runs on the other hand although the average energy level is higher in individuals in asexual populations with increased predation vs control populations the difference is not statistically significant fig 4 a possible explanation for the significantly higher energy for sexual species in the face of predation vs the control runs is increased availability of food resources which is likely due to lower population levels for sexual vs asexual prey as discussed below the same explanation would apply to the non significantly higher energy body size for asexual species in the face of predation vs the control runs these explanations are in fact borne out by our data relating to the amount of grass between experimental vs control runs for both sexual and asexual species fig 5 in our individual based modeling platform ecosim energy is a stand in for body size so that the higher the energy of an individual the greater the body size scott et al 2019 there are a number of empirical studies that confirm the connection between body size energy and food resource availability wolverton et al 2015 found that the larger body size of white tail deer odocoileus virginianus at lower latitudes is explainable by higher food availability as well as a lowered intra specific competition along similar lines lake et al 2008 report that the body mass of emperor geese chen canagica is inversely related to inter specific competition and directly related to food availability yom tov and kjellander 2009 argue that higher food availability is a major contributor to greater body size in animals based on their study of the eurasian lynx lynx lynx moreover rode et al 2010 found that the body size of polar bears ursus maritimus decreased directly with a decrease in sea ice which in turn is positively correlated with level of nutrients in other words polar bear size decreased with a decrease in nutrients finally sheridan and bickford 2011 suggest that the body size of animals decreases as a function of climate change which in turn results in a decrease in nutrients and food resources even though there is significant gain in food resources for both sexual vs asexual species in the experimental vs the control runs one possible reason why there is a significant energy gain in the experimental runs of the sexual species vs the experimental runs of the asexual species is that there is a higher amount of grass in the sexual vs the asexual populationswith 3800 units of grass for sexual prey vs 3000 units of grass for asexual prey by the 2800th time step fig 6 this higher level of grass in the sexual vs the asexual populations could be the result of less intra specific competition between individuals in sexual populations which in turn may be due to lower populations in sexual populations the eventuality of lower population in sexual vs asexual species in the face of predation will be discussed in more detail immediately below gvosdik and smolinsky 2015 concluded that tadpoles and newt larvae with decreased intra specific competition for food resources have larger body sizes higher energy which in turn suggests that the population levels are lower for prey with larger body sizes vs prey with smaller body sizes 4 2 rebut of the hypothesis that in the face of predation population size of asexual species will decrease whereas the population size of sexual species will increase although the first hypothesis regarding escape ratios of sexual predators is corroborated by our simulation data our data also casts doubt on the second hypothesis under investigation in this study in the face of predation sexual populations will increase or stabilize whereas asexual populations will decrease even though one might expect that significantly higher escape ratios for sexual vs asexual populations would result in population increases for sexual species and decreases for asexual species due to differential kill ratios this expectation is not borne out by our data in fact according to our data the opposite is true inn the face of predation whereas populations for asexual species increase populations for sexual species decrease fig 7 population levels for sexual species in experimental runs are significantly lower than population levels for sexual species in control runs following the introduction of increased predation after the 15000th time step fig 7 moreover for sexual species after the 15000th time step there is a steady decrease in population levels for experimental runs whereas population levels for control runs remain relatively stable as will be discussed below these results suggest that for sexual prey with larger energy requirements as an evolutionary response to increased predation food resources are a population limiting factor and in addition that there is a higher kill ratio for sexual experimental vs sexual control runs see fig 8 which may be a result of costs due to mating conversely for asexual species population levels in experimental runs are higher than populations levels in control runs after the 15 000th time step albeit not significantly so as suggested below this is due to smaller body size for asexual prey with fewer escapes and higher rates of successful reproductive attempts 4 3 possible explanations for lower population levels for sexual vs asexual species in the face of higher predation it is clear from the above graphs that sexual vs asexual prey species evolve different techniques for dealing with higher predation whereas sexual species evolve larger body sizes and higher escape ratios to deal with increased predation after the 15 000th time step asexual species remain smaller with lower energy levels resulting in a lower ratio of escape behaviours but with a higher ratio of successful reproductive attempts as will be discussed below the result of having higher energy and hence a larger body size for sexual prey is that more food resources are required to sustain this energy this increased need for food and resultant intra specific competition for resources is a population limiting factor for sexual prey given the importance of resources in logistic population growth for example see sibly and hone 2002 and hopfenberg 2003 another plausible explanation for lower population levels for sexual vs asexual species in experimental runs is that the kill ratio for sexual species is higher than the kill ratio for asexual species which is supported by our data relating to kill ratio fig 7 the dead killed ratio is significantly higher for both sexual and asexual species in experimental runs vs control runs after the 15000th time step although it takes longer for the asexual runs to reach significance which would be expected given the increased rate of predation in experimental runs however the kill ratio for sexual species in experimental runs after the 17000th time step is significantly higher than the kill ratio for asexual species which in turn explains the decreasing population levels for sexual species fig 8 the question that remains is why higher escape ratios for sexual species vs asexual species in experimental runs would result in higher kill ratios for sexual vs asexual species one possible explanation is that the existence of higher escape ratios by itself does not entail that the escaping prey evade capture if their escape patterns are easily learnable by predators using computer simulations french 2009 found that sexual species that developed random escape patterns via recombination were better able to escape predators given that these escape patterns are not easily learnable by predators in other words the success of sexual prey in the face of predation was not the result of a higher escape ratio but rather it was the result of a less learnable escape pattern by predators we did not find this result in our simulations in general due to mating and mating behavior members of sexually reproducing species will be more vulnerable to predators vs asexual species as was discussed by magnhagen 1991 this could explain the higher kill ratios for sexual species despite higher escape ratios another possible factor affecting the decrease in population of sexual species in experimental runs is that there is a lower reproductive attempt ratio in sexual species due to their higher escape ratio according to our data see fig 9 although there is not a significant difference in reproductive attempt ratios there is in fact a significantly lower rate of successful reproductive attempts for sexual vs asexual species in experimental runs which may result in lower populations for sexual species in the face of higher predation and given the higher rate of escape for both sexual and asexual species as a likely response it is understandable that the ratio of reproductive attempts would decrease for both asexual and sexual species since there is more energy being diverted to escape as is evidenced in the left hand graph in fig 10 moreover even though the reproduction ratio remains higher for sexual species the discernable difference in this ratio between sexual vs asexual species after the 15 000th time step is not statistically significant what may partially explain the lower population levels for sexual vs asexual species after the 15 000th time step is that the successful reproductive attempt ratio for asexual species is significantly higher than this ratio for sexual species as is evidenced by the right hand graph in fig 10 this is understandable since even in the face of predation asexual individuals will have a higher rate of reproductive success than sexual individuals since there is no need to mate which can result in increased vulnerability to predators and hence a higher kill ratio 4 4 confirmation of the hypothesis that in the face of predation there will be a decrease in turnover rate for sexual vs asexual prey species although hypothesis 2 that sexual populations remain stable or high in the face of increased predation was not corroborated by our simulation data our data does provide some support for hypothesis 3 that in the face of increased predation sexual species have a lower rate of extinction vs asexual species in our study we found that the extinction rate for sexual species decreased after the introduction of higher rates of predation at the 15 000th time step whereas the extinction rate for asexual species increased slightly or remained the same following the 15 000th time step see fig 11 although these results are discernable they are below the level of statistical significance white et al 2014 argue that theoretical ecologists should not always rely on statistical significance to evaluate their simulation results rather than trying to find low p values argue white et al 2014 ecologists using simulation models should focus more on the magnitude of differences between results fig 11 below summarizes our results regarding higher predation and extinction even though the results are not statistically significant it is evident that after the 15 000th time step with increased predation whereas the extinction rate of sexual prey decreases the extinction rate for asexual species remains the same or perhaps even increases slightly the question that naturally arises is how is it possible for the extinction rate of sexual species to decrease with higher rates of predation even though their population also decreases significantly presumably low populations tend towards extinction due to stochastic effects as discussed in lande et al 2003 and in mashayekhi et al 2014 in that case one might expect that sexual species would have higher extinction rates in the face of higher predation vs asexual species given their lower populations however there are several factors that impinge on extinction rates besides low population size such as resource availability reproduction ratio and body size either large or small as discussed in owens and bennett 2000 and in mashayekhi et al 2014 it particular using machine learning mashayekhi et al 2014 have extracted a rule that suggests that when the kill ratio of predators is lower than some critical threshold value there is a higher chance of extinction the apparent explanation of this rule is that as populations decreases there are fewer individuals left to be hunted by predators mashayekhi et al 2014 our simulations support this explanation since even though kill ratios are higher for sexual prey in the face of higher predation there is at the same time a noticeably higher rate of hunt fail actions for predators hunting sexual prey vs asexual prey after the 15 000th time step with the qualification that these results like the results in fig 11 are not statistically significant one reason for this higher failure rate could be that it is harder for predators to find prey for food if there are fewer of them see fig 11 thus if the failure rate for hunting asexual prey is lower than the failure rate for hunting sexual prey it could be argued that over time asexual populations could tend towards extinction due to a lower failure rate of predator persecution 5 conclusion in our individual based modeling computer simulations sexual species had higher escape rates from predators than asexual species due to higher energy these results corroborate the hypothesis that in the face of higher predation sexual species will have higher escape ratios than asexual species however we found in our modeling that although sexual prey had higher escape ratios than asexual prey in the face of higher predation this does not translate into stable or higher population levels for sexual prey vs asexual prey we found that sexual and asexual prey evolve different traits for dealing with an increase in predation which in turn impinges on population levels whereas sexual prey evolved higher energy levels and larger body size resulting in a higher escape ratio asexual prey retained lower energy levels and retained smaller body size the greater need for food resources for the higher energy sexual prey is a population limiting factor which in part explains the lower population levels for sexual vs asexual prey other factors affecting the decrease in population of sexual species in the face of increased predation is the higher kill ratio due to vulnerability associated with mating along with a lower rate of successful reproductive attempts these results rebut the second hypothesis that sexual prey species will have higher populations than asexual species in the face of predation on the other hand the computer modeling work of french 2010 indicates that to the extent that escape behavior is important for evasion of predators ratio of escape behavior is less important than escape patterns that are less learnable by predators our study does not support french s learnability hypothesis although we did find that there is a discernable difference in extinction rates between sexual vs asexual prey in the face of high predation which implies that a possible advantage of sexual reproduction is lower species extinction rates these results are consistent with our results regarding population and kill ratios for sexual vs asexual prey since a case can be made that at lower population levels there are fewer prey to be killed vs asexual prey this explanation is supported in mashayekhi et al 2014 where it is argued that other factors besides low population can lead to species extinction author declaration funding no funding was received for this work
