8060,study region two typical flux towers and surrounding 100 km 100 km areas in northern china study focus up scaling the instantaneous latent heat flux le to daily scale is an important step for estimate daily evapotranspiration based on satellite observations this study evaluated the performance three up scaling methods constant evaporation fraction cef diurnal le variation dlev and geosynchronous satellite gs by using flux tower and satellite observations at site scale and regional scales respectively the purpose was to improve the accuracy of up scaling le new hydrological insights for the region the results suggested that 1 dlev showed slightly better accuracy rrmse 16 27 26 33 in estimating daily le than cef rrmse 17 21 25 14 at site scale 2 at regional scale gs showed best accuracy rrmse 34 05 followed by dlev rrmse 36 46 cef had the worst accuracy rrmse 38 96 3 delv can accurately describe the le variation during the 8 00 17 00 and show a good agreement with flux tower observations and gs observations but dlev cannot guarantee the estimation accuracy outside of this period in general this study provided a reference for understanding diurnal le variation during a single day additionally the dlev proposed in this study can provide a better up scaling accuracy of regional le estimation than the cef which is currently commonly used keywords up scaling instantaneous geosynchronous satellite diurnal variation evaporation fraction 1 introduction latent heat flux le defined as the energy for evaporating surface moisture is a key node to connect global terrestrial water and energy cycle approximately 60 of precipitation was ultimately evaporated by le and returns to atmosphere which consumed more than half of the solar energy cheng et al 2021a trenberth et al 2009 therefore knowledge of le estimation and its spatial patterns are essential for regional water resources management marzahn et al 2020 satellite remote sensing technology provides an effective method for regional scale le estimation many surface energy balance seb based methods for le estimation have been proposed in previous studies such as surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 and surface energy balance algorithm of land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998a 1998b however satellite can only remotely detect the instantaneous le at the transit time therefore up scaling of le from instantaneous to daily scale is necessary for its application currently it was widely recognized that several ratios between each flux of surface energy budget remain nearly constant during the daytime under certain conditions cheng et al 2021b therefore the ratio can be computed based on the instantaneous information at the satellite transit time then the flux can be further computed in daily scale crago 1996 jackson et al 1983 demonstrated that the flux ratio le s where s indicates the downward shortwave radiation was near constancy during the daytime after that the assumption of constant evaporative fraction ef le rn g where rn indicates the surface net radiation and g indicates the ground heat flux i e ef is nearly stable during the day time was proposed by gurney and hsu 1990 and shuttleworth 1989 and has been widely employed for le up scaling cheng et al 2020a 2021b sugita and brutsaert 1991 and brutsaert and sugita 1992 tested the constant ef cef method by only given few measurements of ef during the single day and resulted in a good performance with correlation coefficients more than 0 90 when two or more measured ef were available however most of polar orbit satellite only transit once in a single day similarly bowen ratio bowen 1926 was also attempt to use for le up scaling but generally performed worse than cef method crago 1996 in general these flux ratio based methods could accurately estimate daily scale le to a certain extent geosynchronous satellite with high observation frequency could provide another way for daily scale le estimation for example meteosat 11 launched by european union in 2015 has 1 3 km spatial resolution and 15 min observation frequency bruin et al 2015 fy 4a launched by china in 2016 has 0 5 4 km spatial resolution and 15 min observation frequency peng et al 2019 himawari 8 launched by japan in 2015 has 0 5 2 km spatial resolution and 10 min observation frequency he et al 2019 regarding to le european organization for the exploitation of meteorological satellites eumetsat provides a le product with 3 km spatial resolution and 30 min temporal resolution based on meteosat 11 satellite and soil vegetation atmosphere transfer svat models hu et al 2015 paredes et al 2021 however few studies focused on the high frequency le computation during a single day based on seb methods and geosynchronous satellite compared to flux ratio based methods geosynchronous satellite based method could provide more frequency le observations during a day and then the daily scale le can be calculated directly through integration land surface temperature ts as a key parameter for retrieving surface energy fluxes also needs to be up scaled from instantaneous to daily scale as average value therefore many diurnal temperatures cycle dtc models have been proposed to describe the ts variation over a single day and further estimate the average ts for example using cosine function to describe the ts diurnal variation is the most common model duan et al 2012 göttsche and olesen 2001 initially used cosine function to build a semi empirical model to describe the ts variation inamdar et al 2008 and jiang et al 2006 further improved this semi empirical model which in the form of cosine function moreover göttsche and olesen 2009 developed a new dtc model by introducing extraterrestrial solar irradiation and seb instead of calculating from the thermal diffusion and this model was also in the form of cosine function in general these dtc models and cosine function showed a good performance in describing ts variation duan et al 2012 however as an energy flux le is strongly correlated to ts cheng et al 2021a but few studies explored whether the diurnal le variation dlev during the daytime could be described by using a cosine function therefore in this study we attempt to compare the three ways for daily scale le estimation constant ef method cef geosynchronous satellite gs method and dlev method then the flux tower based observed data and a geosynchronous satellite himawari 8 were used to test the estimation accuracy of the three ways overall we aimed to achieve the following three objectives in this study 1 evaluate the performance of cosine curve in describing the dlev during the daytime 2 use himawari 8 and sebal to estimate multiple instantaneous le during the daytime 3 evaluate whether the geosynchronous satellite method and dlev method could improve the daily scale le estimation compared to original cef method 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area in this study we selected two flux observation towers huailai 115 79 e 40 35 n and xinxiang 114 25 e 35 22 n which are in the northern china and the area of 100 km 100 km around the two sites as the study object fig 1 the eddy covariance system of flux tower measures le and sensible heat flux h from the covariance of the moisture and heat fluxes respectively with vertical velocity by using a rapid response sensor at frequencies generally equal to or more than 10 hz wang and dickinson 2012 these two flux towers huailai and xinxiang equipped with li 7500 eddy covariance analysis system and observed le unit w m2 and h unit w m2 in a frequency of 30 min the sensors of eddy covariance system in the towers were set up at the height of 40 m of the tower in which the observation period of huailai was from january 2016 to december 2017 a total of 109 days of samples can be used due to parts of samples were missed the observation period of xinxiang was from july 2019 to june 2020 with totally 359 days of samples the details of the flux towers can be referred to chinaflux http www chinaflux org xinxiang is located in a temperate continental monsoon climate with an elevation of 74 m the surrounding area is mainly cropland including maize wheat and soybean and parts of shrubs the average annual temperature of xinxiang is 14 1 the coldest in january with an average temperature of 0 7 and the warmest in july with an average temperature of 27 1 the average annual precipitation is 548 3 mm and the average annual frost free period is 200 5 days huailai is located in a temperate semi arid continental monsoon climate with an elevation of 480 m the average temperature in january is 7 4 coldest the average temperature in july is 24 4 warmest and the average annual temperature is 9 6 the annual precipitation of huailai is about 370 mm and the annual frost free period is 149 days 2 2 up scaling methods 2 2 1 cef method the assumption of constant ef during the daytime was employed for le up scaling the daily le led can be calculated as eqs 1 and 2 1 e f l e i n s r n i n s g i n s l e i n s l e i n s h i n s 2 l e d e f r n g d where rn is net radiation w m2 g is ground heat flux w m2 h is sensible heat flux w m2 the subscript ins indicates the variables of instantaneous scale at satellite transit time where the subscript d indicates the variables of daily scale regarding to the available energy rn g which was assumed to follow a sine curve range from 0 to π crago 1996 thus the equations can be expressed as follows 3 r n g t p 1 sin p 2 t p 3 where p1 p2 and p3 are the empirical parameters the subscript t indicates the variables of instantaneous scale at time t moreover sugita and brutsaert 1991 suggested that the nighttime le was rarely exceeded 7 of the daily total le thus the daytime le is close to daily le therefore the daily rn g can be calculated as the integral of eq 4 from sunrise t1 to sunset t2 as eqs 4 7 4 r n g d t 1 t 2 p 1 sin p 2 t p 3 d t p 1 p 2 cos p 2 t p 3 t 1 t 2 p 1 p 2 cos p 2 t 2 p 3 cos p 2 t 1 p 3 5 p 2 t 1 p 3 0 6 p 2 t 2 p 3 π 7 r n g d 2 p 1 t 2 t 1 π when the satellite only transit once in a single day it assumed that the transit time is t0 thus the rn g at t0 rn g t0 can be calculated based on satellite observed information and the rn g t0 can also expressed by using eq 8 as shown in follows 8 r n g t 0 p 1 sin π t 0 t 2 t 1 π t 1 t 2 t 1 in general the daily scale available energy can ultimately expressed as follow equation 9 r n g d 2 t 2 t 1 π r n g t 0 sin π t 0 t 2 t 1 π t 1 t 2 t 1 it has been known that the time with zero of solar altitude angle is the sunrise time t1 and sunset time t2 thus the t1 and t2 can be calculated as follows 10 t 1 12 arccos sin φ sin δ cos φ cos δ π 12 11 t 2 12 arccos π sin φ sin δ cos φ cos δ π 12 where φ is location latitude δ is the solar declination which can be calculated as a function of the julian day j 12 δ 0 409 sin 2 π 365 j 1 39 2 2 2 dlev method currently few studies focused on the diurnal le variation dlev therefore we built the dlev function by referred a commonly used dtc model duan et al 2012 evaluated six dtc models and suggested the jng06 model which proposed by jiang et al 2006 had a good performance in describing the temperature variation therefore jng06 model were used to describe dlev jng06 based model used cosine function to describe dlev as follows 13 l e t l e 0 l e max cos β t t m where let indicates the le at time t le0 indicates the le at sunrise time which was assumed as zero in this study lemax is the maximum le in the day β is an empirical parameter equal to π t2 t1 tm is the time when le reached maximum in the day the value is 12 5 by referred to the study of duan et al 2012 2 2 3 geosynchronous satellite method the geosynchronous satellite gs himawari 8 was employed to calculated multiple instantaneous le in a single day based on sebal the details of sebal can be referred to appendix the ahi sensor equipped in himawari 8 can collect three visible bands three near infrared bands and ten infrared bands as shown in table 1 japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa provides a surface albedo product of visible and near infrared bands and a brightness temperature bt product of infrared bands which have spatial resolution of 2 km and temporal resolution of 10 min https www eorc jaxa jp ptree the himawari 8 albedo product was used for sebal input the brightness temperature of band 14 was used to estimate ts by using eq 14 as follows zeng et al 2008 14 t s b t ε 0 25 where ε is surface emissivity regarding to the ε of band 14 an empirical model was used to calculate by introducing mod11 emissivity product band 31 of modis spatial resolution is 1 km and temporal resolution is daily as shown in eq 15 liu et al 2017 15 ε a h i 14 0 2332 0 7590 ε m o d i s 31 additionally mod09 surface reflectance product spatial resolution is 1 km and temporal resolution is daily was used to calculate ndvi in this study we assumed the ndvi stay stable during a single day mod09 and mod11 products were obtained from nasa level 1 and atmosphere archive distribution system distributed active archive center laads daac https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov air temperature ta and windspeed ws were obtained from global land data assimilation system gldas noah land surface model v2 1 product with 0 25 spatial resolution and 3 h temporal resolution https disc gsfc nasa gov table 2 shows the sources of remote sensing data used in this study mod09 surface reflectance product and mod11 emissivity product with fine spatial resolution 1 km were resampled to 2 km spatial resolution using nearest method to match himawari 8 products ta and ws data resampled to half hour temporal resolution by linear interpolation and the coarse spatial resolution was non linearly interpolated to 2 km spatial resolution by referred the method of zhao et al 2005 2 3 application by using satellite data in order to evaluate the applicability of each up scaling method in satellite scale le retrieval three scenarios were set for the comparison fig 2 regarding to scenario 1 and 2 corresponding to cef and dlev method which could estimate daily le by using only one instantaneous satellite data i e only one available ef retrieved from satellite data here the time of available ef or le was defined as aet in the scenario 1 and 2 the aet was assumed as 11 00 which referred to the transit time of commonly used satellite landsat 10 55 in local time and modis terra 10 30 in local time for geosynchronous satellite gs method scenario 3 the instantaneous le was computed independently in every half hour from sunrise to sunset time eqs 10 and 11 and finally accumulated to daily scale in this study totally of 24 days of images were employed for le retrieval each image covered an area of 100 km 100 km which are a suitable domain size study area of sebal cheng et al 2021b moreover the modis quality control files was used to remove the unreliable pixels caused by clouds or other reasons the unreliable pixels of himawari 8 were also removed by the same methods it should be noted that the selected 24 days of images have more than 60 reliable pixels and ensuring the pixels located flux towers were reliable 2 4 validation methods the flux tower observed data were used for validation at both site scale and regional scale satellite observation specially the le of the pixel where the flux tower is located 2 km was used to match the flux tower observations in the validation of regional scale moreover three metrics were used to evaluate the accuracy determination coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse and relative root mean square error rrmse which are calculated as follows cheng et al 2022a 2022b 16 r 2 1 1 i 1 n l e m i l e m 2 i 1 n l e o b i l e o b 2 n 1 n m 1 17 r m s e 1 n i 1 n l e m i l e o b i 2 18 r r m s e r m s e l e o b 100 where lemi and leobi are the estimated le and in situ measured le respectively n 125 is the number of samples and m 1 is the number of variables 3 results 3 1 cef method 3 1 1 validation in site scale a total of five aets 09 00 11 00 13 00 15 00 and 17 00 were selected for model input to evaluate the performance of available ef in different times the results was shown in fig 3 and table 3 r2 varied from 0 64 to 0 79 rmse varied from 8 75 to 11 15 w m2 and rrmse varied from 19 72 to 25 14 in xinxiang site the performance in huailai showed slightly higher than xinxiang with r2 varied from 0 87 to 0 92 rmse varied from 9 36 to 11 99 w m2 and rrmse varied from 17 21 to 22 04 in general both the two sites showed that the higher accuracy were found at the 11 00 and 13 00 of aet than other periods the cef method has an acceptable accuracy for le up scaling 3 1 2 application by using satellite data fig 4a presented the performance of cef method by using instantaneous satellite data at 11 00 in general the cef method had a certain error in estimating daily le with rrmse reached 38 96 and rmse and r2 was 30 01 w m2 and 0 76 respectively however it should be noted that the instantaneous le estimation had a certain error as well fig 4b the r2 rmse and rrmse was 0 83 39 66 w m2 and 26 13 respectively the error of instantaneous le estimation at aet account for a large part of daily le estimation error which was more than the error from up scaling method itself be that as it may the up scaling method still have potential to be improved 3 2 dlev method 3 2 1 validation in site scale fig 5 and table 4 presented the results of dlev method performance in up scaling le from instantaneous to daily scale in general dlev method performed a similar accuracy with cef method in which the r2 varied from 0 58 to 0 83 with different aets and rmse varied from 7 67 to 13 01 w m2 rrmse varied from 17 28 to 26 33 in the validation of xinxiang site while in huailai the r2 varied from 0 77 to 0 96 rmse varied from 8 85 to 15 36 w m2 and rrmse varied from 16 27 to 28 24 the accuracy difference derived from various aets was generally larger than that of cef method the aets in the noon 11 00 and 13 00 resulted in a better performance with r2 more than 0 80 and rrmse less than 20 which were better than other aets in both xinxiang and huailai site dlev method could describe the le variation during the day by using only one measured le which is different from cef method fig 6 presented the results of dlev method performance in describing instantaneous le during a day in different aets in general dlev method could describe the le variation well during the daytime in which the r2 was almost exceed 0 40 in the validation of xinxiang site during 8 00 17 00 which was the main period of daytime while in huailai site the r2 was almost exceeded 0 60 during this period regardless aets 3 2 2 application by using satellite data fig 7a presented the dlev method performance in estimating daily le by only using the instantaneous satellite data at 11 00 compared to cef method the accuracy of dlev method had a slight improvement with the r2 rmse and rrmse were 0 79 28 27 w m2 and 36 46 respectively however this method still had a certain error it was worth noting that dlev method could describe the diurnal variation of le and estimate instantaneous le of specified time fig 7b presented the performance of instantaneous le in every half hour from sunrise to sunset which were estimated using dlev method and aet of 11 00 the results showed that the r2 rmse and rrmse were 0 64 24 86 w m2 and 33 49 respectively although it had a certain error it should be noted the error was mainly came from the instantaneous le at 11 00 which showed that rrmse reached 26 13 fig 4b in general dlev method could describe le variation well and estimate instantaneous le of other specified time 3 3 geosynchronous satellite method compared to the cef and dlev which only using instantaneous satellite data at aet geosynchronous satellite gs method provided higher observation frequency without any assumption as shown in fig 8a the gs method performed higher accuracy in daily le estimation than cef and dlev method the r2 rmse and rrmse were 0 83 26 99 w m2 and 34 05 respectively moreover fig 8b showed the accuracy of instantaneous le estimated by using high frequency observation data of himawari 8 and sebal in general it performed an acceptable accuracy with r2 rmse and rrmse were 0 72 25 42 w m2 and 31 59 which was slightly higher than dlev method as described in section 3 2 dlev method could estimate instantaneous le well during the daytime which was further proved by the comparison of the dlev method with gs method fig 9 the comparison of instantaneous le in every half hour from sunrise to sunset suggested that the two methods had a good agreement with the r2 rmse and rrmse were 0 83 10 12 w m2 and 19 42 respectively it should be noted that dlev method performed worse in low le area which were generally occurred at near sunrise or sunset time as shown in green cycle fig 9 which was consistent with the results in section 3 2 1 while the comparison was conducted from 8 00 17 00 the two methods showed higher agreement with the r2 rmse and rrmse was 0 92 14 69 w m2 and 14 56 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 summary in this study three le up scaling methods cef dlev and gs were compared by using flux tower observations for validation moreover they were further applied and compared in regional scale by using satellite data and sebal it should be noted that there are certain errors in flux observations previous studies have demonstrated that ect still have a typical error of approximately 5 20 culf et al 2008 vickers et al 2010 while for regional scale validation by using flux observations the mismatch of ect footprint and satellite data spatial resolution will also cause the errors of up scaling method validation the footprint of the ect generally varied from hundreds to thousands of square meters which was mainly determined by the observation instrument height the turbulence intensity environment terrain and vegetation covers chen et al 2012 cheng et al 2021b damm et al 2020 and it also can be characterized by a footprint probability distribution function when at a fine spatial resolution wang et al 2019 regarding to coarse resolution in this study 2 km the footprint was not easy to be matched accurately additionally different environment and terrain will cause the difference observation accuracy cheng et al 2021a therefore the performance of the two flux towers existed a certain error in the regional scale application based on satellite observations sbeal and the inputs will cause errors besides up scaling methods for example using cef method to estimate daily le had an error with rrmse of 38 96 and that of dlev method was 36 46 in which the instantaneous le estimated by sebal had an error with rrmse of 26 13 fig 4b sebal is a mature algorithm and has been widely used but the complexity of the algorithm itself and several assumptions cause the estimated le have error to different extents cheng et al 2021b long et al 2011 for example the hot cold pixel selection in the process of sensible heat flux calculation of sebal which may cause an error of 50 w m2 of sensible heat flux seguin et al 1999 moreover several studies suggested that the most may induce an error of 10 20 foken 2006 högström and bergström 1996 additionally the uncertainties of sebal inputs also induce the error of results modis data has been widely used for et estimation and resulted in a good performance cheng et al 2021a 2021b in this study mod11 emissivity products which are estimated from land cover types snyder et al 2010 were used for lst estimation at presents few studies evaluated the performance of mod11 emissivity while the mod11 surface temperature products based on emissivity have been proved exist biases of 0 91 3 13 k li et al 2014 moreover the key parameter of sebal brightness temperature from himawari 8 has also been widely used choi and suh 2018 liu et al 2019 yu et al 2019 choi and suh 2018 used himawari 8 data to retrieval land surface temperature and resulted in a bias of 0 45 k liu et al 2019 used himawari 8 data to estimate air temperature and also obtained a good accuracy with a bias of 0 04 in general the remote sensing data used in this study has certain reliability but it will still affect the result of sebal 4 2 errors of cef method currently cef method is a commonly used up scaling method of le some studies used this method for regional evapotranspiration estimation and obtained an acceptable accuracy cheng et al 2020b 2021b similarly the flux tower observations were used for cef method evaluation in this study and the results presented a good agreement with observed value be that as it may many of its assumptions inevitably induced certain errors liu 2021 the cef method firstly assumed that ef stay constant over the daytime but it is not completely accurate crago 1996 the two flux towers xinxiang and huailai observation data presented that ef had a great variation during a day and only keep relative stable during 8 00 16 00 blue area in the fig 10 while in the period from sunrise to 8 00 and 16 00 to sunset the ef was higher than that of daytime i e 11 00 therefore this assumption will theoretically underestimate le gentine et al 2007 used a constant number 1 1 to correct underestimated le which can reduced the systematic underestimation ryu et al 2012 similarly niel et al 2011 introduced a time dependent factors to reduce the systematic underestimation however the determination of these parameters still needs a further discussion liu 2021 besides the calculation of daily rn g was necessary before le retrieval when using cef method generally rn g was assumed varied as a sine curve from 0 to π radians crago 1996 we further discussed the uncertainties derived from this assumption fig 11 in general this method can well estimate the daily rn g with a good agreement with measured value r2 0 90 but remained an error of rrmse 12 37 moreover other studies proposed that daily g ground heat flux can be ignored cheng et al 2021b in general the calculation of rn g has a great potential to be improved as compared to the overall accuracy of le rrmse 17 21 25 14 in table 3 4 3 errors of dlev method accurately describing the diurnal variation of energy flux is of great importance for hydrology and ecosystem monitoring however due to the various weather and vegetation conditions changed the shape of the variation curve is difficult to be determined liu 2021 in this study cosine function was employed to describe le variation and resulted in an acceptable accuracy with r2 reached 0 96 at best liu 2021 used sine and gaussian curve to describe le variation and obtained similar accuracy r2 reached 0 90 at best however this method remained errors to a certain extent several factors may cause the error of this method which are difficult to be avoided previous studies suggested that used potential evapotranspiration pet defined as the evapotranspiration of reference crop can fit the curve better than directly using evapotranspiration et or le which may due to the vegetation status changing is ignored cammalleri et al 2014 similarly the variation curve may perform better when the weather is a clear day during the daytime while suddenly changes of weather such as precipitation will affect the shape of curve wandera et al 2017 which may cause the limited accuracy of dlev method for le up scaling several studies used daily atmospheric transmissivity τ to characterize the sky condition to evaluate the performance of dlev method liu 2021 suggested that when τ 0 6 the curve can well describe the le variation similarly wandera et al 2017 indicates that the condition of τ 0 75 resulted in the highest accuracy it should be noted that dlev method performed poor accuracy r2 lower than 0 40 from the period outside 8 00 17 00 fig 6 while for the period with higher le the simulation accuracy can be guaranteed the aet were often closer to this period which was better for the curve fitting moreover the cosine curve used in this study will presented values near 0 when the time is close to sunrise or sunset however flux tower observations often perform the non closure issue in the period with low value but the low accuracy of this period may have little impact on the daily le estimation which was agree with the previous studies delogu et al 2012 liu 2021 wandera et al 2017 moreover compared to the previous studies of delogu et al 2012 resulted in high accuracy during 11 00 13 00 wandera et al 2017 resulted in high accuracy during 9 00 15 00 and liu 2021 resulted in high accuracy during 11 00 14 00 the dlev method in this study provided a longer period with high accuracy of le simulation 4 4 gs method compared to cef and dlev method the accuracy of gs method was only affected by sebal and without any assumptions however multiple instantaneous le calculations based on sebal inevitably increased the uncertainty of daily le estimation for example the estimation instantaneous le at different time in this study remained errors with rrmse of 31 59 fig 9 which was close to the results of relevant studies cheng et al 2021b 2020c moreover it should be noted that several studies have demonstrated that sebal performed different in various vegetation types cheng et al 2021b jaafar and ahmad 2020 rahimzadegan and janani 2019 however only two flux towers which are located in cropland ecosystem were employed in this study cheng et al 2021b suggested that sebal have the highest accuracy in cropland among the three ecosystems cropland grassland and forest therefore gs method may perform worse in other ecosystems similarly sebal performed different accuracy in various climate zones and terrain cheng et al 2021b thus more sites need to be used in such studies in general gs method can accurately estimate multiple instantaneous le during the daytime because of the high frequency observations moreover high frequency observations can also improve the possibility of obtaining cloudless satellite images currently few studies focus on the le retrieval based on gs in china besides the related parameters required in the sebal are also need to be improved e g land surface temperature choi and suh 2018 and surface albedo damiani et al 2018 which stay at a relative low estimation accuracy overall gs method has a great potential to reach higher accuracy 5 conclusion in this study we used two flux observations and himawari 8 geosynchronous satellite to analyze the three methods for le up scaling from instantaneous to daily scale the results showed that in site scale validation the rrmse of dlev method in estimating daily le varied from 16 27 to 26 33 which was slightly better than that of original cef method rrmse 17 21 25 14 moreover dlev can accurately describe the instantaneous le during the 8 00 17 00 r2 0 4 regardless aets when using satellite data to estimate daily le gs rrmse 34 05 method performed highest accuracy followed by dlev rrmse 36 46 which were all slightly better than cef method rrmse 38 96 while for instantaneous le estimation dlev and gs method presented comparable accuracy however dlev method cannot guarantee the accuracy of the time outside of 8 00 17 00 in general the results in this study can provide a reference for understanding diurnal le variation during a single day additionally other two methods dlev gs were proved to obtain higher accuracy of daily le estimation than original cef method credit authorship

satellite transit time to g the value of c is 0 9 when transmission times was before 12 00 local time lt 1 0 when transmission times was between 12 00 and 14 00 lt and 1 1 when transmission times was between 14 00 and 16 00 lt h was calculated by using eq a10 a10 h ρ a i r c p d t r a where cp unit j kg k is the specific heat of air ρair unit kg m3 is the air density eq a11 smith et al 1991 dt

linear relationship between dt and surface temperature ts unit k as shown in eq a16 a16 d t a t s b where a and b were solved by selecting the cold and hot pixels in sebal in which the hot pixel was assumed to represent the pixel of bare surfaces or low vegetation covers and have zero le i e h rn g and the cold pixel was assumed to represent the pixel with lush vegetation low temperature or sufficient water supply with zero h i e le rn g the cold and hot pixels were automatedly selected by following several certain rules in this study long et al 2011 for hot pixel firstly the pixels with low ndvi top 10 and high ts top 10 were selected and further select the pixels with cropland covers or bare surfaces from the pixels which were selected in last step and finally select the pixel with highest ts among these pixels as the hot pixel additionally for cold pixel the pixels with high ndvi top 10 and low ts top 10 were selected first and then to select the pixels with the dense vegetation covers generally forest from the pixels which were selected in first step finally select the pixel with lowest ts among these pixels as the cold pixel after determined the cold and hot pixels a and b can be calculated as follows a17 a r n h o t g h o t r a h o t c p ρ a i r h o t t s h o t t s c o l d a18 b a t s c o l d additionally it was worth noting that ra and h are interrelated variables therefore the monin obkhov similarity theory most based monin obkhov length l unit m was introduced to the iterative calculation to obtain the stable values of ra and h the monin obkhov length which is used as a parameter to reflect the turbulent characteristics of the near surface layer eq a19 monin and obukhov 1954 ψm zr is the stability correction function of momentum

8060,study region two typical flux towers and surrounding 100 km 100 km areas in northern china study focus up scaling the instantaneous latent heat flux le to daily scale is an important step for estimate daily evapotranspiration based on satellite observations this study evaluated the performance three up scaling methods constant evaporation fraction cef diurnal le variation dlev and geosynchronous satellite gs by using flux tower and satellite observations at site scale and regional scales respectively the purpose was to improve the accuracy of up scaling le new hydrological insights for the region the results suggested that 1 dlev showed slightly better accuracy rrmse 16 27 26 33 in estimating daily le than cef rrmse 17 21 25 14 at site scale 2 at regional scale gs showed best accuracy rrmse 34 05 followed by dlev rrmse 36 46 cef had the worst accuracy rrmse 38 96 3 delv can accurately describe the le variation during the 8 00 17 00 and show a good agreement with flux tower observations and gs observations but dlev cannot guarantee the estimation accuracy outside of this period in general this study provided a reference for understanding diurnal le variation during a single day additionally the dlev proposed in this study can provide a better up scaling accuracy of regional le estimation than the cef which is currently commonly used keywords up scaling instantaneous geosynchronous satellite diurnal variation evaporation fraction 1 introduction latent heat flux le defined as the energy for evaporating surface moisture is a key node to connect global terrestrial water and energy cycle approximately 60 of precipitation was ultimately evaporated by le and returns to atmosphere which consumed more than half of the solar energy cheng et al 2021a trenberth et al 2009 therefore knowledge of le estimation and its spatial patterns are essential for regional water resources management marzahn et al 2020 satellite remote sensing technology provides an effective method for regional scale le estimation many surface energy balance seb based methods for le estimation have been proposed in previous studies such as surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 and surface energy balance algorithm of land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998a 1998b however satellite can only remotely detect the instantaneous le at the transit time therefore up scaling of le from instantaneous to daily scale is necessary for its application currently it was widely recognized that several ratios between each flux of surface energy budget remain nearly constant during the daytime under certain conditions cheng et al 2021b therefore the ratio can be computed based on the instantaneous information at the satellite transit time then the flux can be further computed in daily scale crago 1996 jackson et al 1983 demonstrated that the flux ratio le s where s indicates the downward shortwave radiation was near constancy during the daytime after that the assumption of constant evaporative fraction ef le rn g where rn indicates the surface net radiation and g indicates the ground heat flux i e ef is nearly stable during the day time was proposed by gurney and hsu 1990 and shuttleworth 1989 and has been widely employed for le up scaling cheng et al 2020a 2021b sugita and brutsaert 1991 and brutsaert and sugita 1992 tested the constant ef cef method by only given few measurements of ef during the single day and resulted in a good performance with correlation coefficients more than 0 90 when two or more measured ef were available however most of polar orbit satellite only transit once in a single day similarly bowen ratio bowen 1926 was also attempt to use for le up scaling but generally performed worse than cef method crago 1996 in general these flux ratio based methods could accurately estimate daily scale le to a certain extent geosynchronous satellite with high observation frequency could provide another way for daily scale le estimation for example meteosat 11 launched by european union in 2015 has 1 3 km spatial resolution and 15 min observation frequency bruin et al 2015 fy 4a launched by china in 2016 has 0 5 4 km spatial resolution and 15 min observation frequency peng et al 2019 himawari 8 launched by japan in 2015 has 0 5 2 km spatial resolution and 10 min observation frequency he et al 2019 regarding to le european organization for the exploitation of meteorological satellites eumetsat provides a le product with 3 km spatial resolution and 30 min temporal resolution based on meteosat 11 satellite and soil vegetation atmosphere transfer svat models hu et al 2015 paredes et al 2021 however few studies focused on the high frequency le computation during a single day based on seb methods and geosynchronous satellite compared to flux ratio based methods geosynchronous satellite based method could provide more frequency le observations during a day and then the daily scale le can be calculated directly through integration land surface temperature ts as a key parameter for retrieving surface energy fluxes also needs to be up scaled from instantaneous to daily scale as average value therefore many diurnal temperatures cycle dtc models have been proposed to describe the ts variation over a single day and further estimate the average ts for example using cosine function to describe the ts diurnal variation is the most common model duan et al 2012 göttsche and olesen 2001 initially used cosine function to build a semi empirical model to describe the ts variation inamdar et al 2008 and jiang et al 2006 further improved this semi empirical model which in the form of cosine function moreover göttsche and olesen 2009 developed a new dtc model by introducing extraterrestrial solar irradiation and seb instead of calculating from the thermal diffusion and this model was also in the form of cosine function in general these dtc models and cosine function showed a good performance in describing ts variation duan et al 2012 however as an energy flux le is strongly correlated to ts cheng et al 2021a but few studies explored whether the diurnal le variation dlev during the daytime could be described by using a cosine function therefore in this study we attempt to compare the three ways for daily scale le estimation constant ef method cef geosynchronous satellite gs method and dlev method then the flux tower based observed data and a geosynchronous satellite himawari 8 were used to test the estimation accuracy of the three ways overall we aimed to achieve the following three objectives in this study 1 evaluate the performance of cosine curve in describing the dlev during the daytime 2 use himawari 8 and sebal to estimate multiple instantaneous le during the daytime 3 evaluate whether the geosynchronous satellite method and dlev method could improve the daily scale le estimation compared to original cef method 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area in this study we selected two flux observation towers huailai 115 79 e 40 35 n and xinxiang 114 25 e 35 22 n which are in the northern china and the area of 100 km 100 km around the two sites as the study object fig 1 the eddy covariance system of flux tower measures le and sensible heat flux h from the covariance of the moisture and heat fluxes respectively with vertical velocity by using a rapid response sensor at frequencies generally equal to or more than 10 hz wang and dickinson 2012 these two flux towers huailai and xinxiang equipped with li 7500 eddy covariance analysis system and observed le unit w m2 and h unit w m2 in a frequency of 30 min the sensors of eddy covariance system in the towers were set up at the height of 40 m of the tower in which the observation period of huailai was from january 2016 to december 2017 a total of 109 days of samples can be used due to parts of samples were missed the observation period of xinxiang was from july 2019 to june 2020 with totally 359 days of samples the details of the flux towers can be referred to chinaflux http www chinaflux org xinxiang is located in a temperate continental monsoon climate with an elevation of 74 m the surrounding area is mainly cropland including maize wheat and soybean and parts of shrubs the average annual temperature of xinxiang is 14 1 the coldest in january with an average temperature of 0 7 and the warmest in july with an average temperature of 27 1 the average annual precipitation is 548 3 mm and the average annual frost free period is 200 5 days huailai is located in a temperate semi arid continental monsoon climate with an elevation of 480 m the average temperature in january is 7 4 coldest the average temperature in july is 24 4 warmest and the average annual temperature is 9 6 the annual precipitation of huailai is about 370 mm and the annual frost free period is 149 days 2 2 up scaling methods 2 2 1 cef method the assumption of constant ef during the daytime was employed for le up scaling the daily le led can be calculated as eqs 1 and 2 1 e f l e i n s r n i n s g i n s l e i n s l e i n s h i n s 2 l e d e f r n g d where rn is net radiation w m2 g is ground heat flux w m2 h is sensible heat flux w m2 the subscript ins indicates the variables of instantaneous scale at satellite transit time where the subscript d indicates the variables of daily scale regarding to the available energy rn g which was assumed to follow a sine curve range from 0 to π crago 1996 thus the equations can be expressed as follows 3 r n g t p 1 sin p 2 t p 3 where p1 p2 and p3 are the empirical parameters the subscript t indicates the variables of instantaneous scale at time t moreover sugita and brutsaert 1991 suggested that the nighttime le was rarely exceeded 7 of the daily total le thus the daytime le is close to daily le therefore the daily rn g can be calculated as the integral of eq 4 from sunrise t1 to sunset t2 as eqs 4 7 4 r n g d t 1 t 2 p 1 sin p 2 t p 3 d t p 1 p 2 cos p 2 t p 3 t 1 t 2 p 1 p 2 cos p 2 t 2 p 3 cos p 2 t 1 p 3 5 p 2 t 1 p 3 0 6 p 2 t 2 p 3 π 7 r n g d 2 p 1 t 2 t 1 π when the satellite only transit once in a single day it assumed that the transit time is t0 thus the rn g at t0 rn g t0 can be calculated based on satellite observed information and the rn g t0 can also expressed by using eq 8 as shown in follows 8 r n g t 0 p 1 sin π t 0 t 2 t 1 π t 1 t 2 t 1 in general the daily scale available energy can ultimately expressed as follow equation 9 r n g d 2 t 2 t 1 π r n g t 0 sin π t 0 t 2 t 1 π t 1 t 2 t 1 it has been known that the time with zero of solar altitude angle is the sunrise time t1 and sunset time t2 thus the t1 and t2 can be calculated as follows 10 t 1 12 arccos sin φ sin δ cos φ cos δ π 12 11 t 2 12 arccos π sin φ sin δ cos φ cos δ π 12 where φ is location latitude δ is the solar declination which can be calculated as a function of the julian day j 12 δ 0 409 sin 2 π 365 j 1 39 2 2 2 dlev method currently few studies focused on the diurnal le variation dlev therefore we built the dlev function by referred a commonly used dtc model duan et al 2012 evaluated six dtc models and suggested the jng06 model which proposed by jiang et al 2006 had a good performance in describing the temperature variation therefore jng06 model were used to describe dlev jng06 based model used cosine function to describe dlev as follows 13 l e t l e 0 l e max cos β t t m where let indicates the le at time t le0 indicates the le at sunrise time which was assumed as zero in this study lemax is the maximum le in the day β is an empirical parameter equal to π t2 t1 tm is the time when le reached maximum in the day the value is 12 5 by referred to the study of duan et al 2012 2 2 3 geosynchronous satellite method the geosynchronous satellite gs himawari 8 was employed to calculated multiple instantaneous le in a single day based on sebal the details of sebal can be referred to appendix the ahi sensor equipped in himawari 8 can collect three visible bands three near infrared bands and ten infrared bands as shown in table 1 japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa provides a surface albedo product of visible and near infrared bands and a brightness temperature bt product of infrared bands which have spatial resolution of 2 km and temporal resolution of 10 min https www eorc jaxa jp ptree the himawari 8 albedo product was used for sebal input the brightness temperature of band 14 was used to estimate ts by using eq 14 as follows zeng et al 2008 14 t s b t ε 0 25 where ε is surface emissivity regarding to the ε of band 14 an empirical model was used to calculate by introducing mod11 emissivity product band 31 of modis spatial resolution is 1 km and temporal resolution is daily as shown in eq 15 liu et al 2017 15 ε a h i 14 0 2332 0 7590 ε m o d i s 31 additionally mod09 surface reflectance product spatial resolution is 1 km and temporal resolution is daily was used to calculate ndvi in this study we assumed the ndvi stay stable during a single day mod09 and mod11 products were obtained from nasa level 1 and atmosphere archive distribution system distributed active archive center laads daac https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov air temperature ta and windspeed ws were obtained from global land data assimilation system gldas noah land surface model v2 1 product with 0 25 spatial resolution and 3 h temporal resolution https disc gsfc nasa gov table 2 shows the sources of remote sensing data used in this study mod09 surface reflectance product and mod11 emissivity product with fine spatial resolution 1 km were resampled to 2 km spatial resolution using nearest method to match himawari 8 products ta and ws data resampled to half hour temporal resolution by linear interpolation and the coarse spatial resolution was non linearly interpolated to 2 km spatial resolution by referred the method of zhao et al 2005 2 3 application by using satellite data in order to evaluate the applicability of each up scaling method in satellite scale le retrieval three scenarios were set for the comparison fig 2 regarding to scenario 1 and 2 corresponding to cef and dlev method which could estimate daily le by using only one instantaneous satellite data i e only one available ef retrieved from satellite data here the time of available ef or le was defined as aet in the scenario 1 and 2 the aet was assumed as 11 00 which referred to the transit time of commonly used satellite landsat 10 55 in local time and modis terra 10 30 in local time for geosynchronous satellite gs method scenario 3 the instantaneous le was computed independently in every half hour from sunrise to sunset time eqs 10 and 11 and finally accumulated to daily scale in this study totally of 24 days of images were employed for le retrieval each image covered an area of 100 km 100 km which are a suitable domain size study area of sebal cheng et al 2021b moreover the modis quality control files was used to remove the unreliable pixels caused by clouds or other reasons the unreliable pixels of himawari 8 were also removed by the same methods it should be noted that the selected 24 days of images have more than 60 reliable pixels and ensuring the pixels located flux towers were reliable 2 4 validation methods the flux tower observed data were used for validation at both site scale and regional scale satellite observation specially the le of the pixel where the flux tower is located 2 km was used to match the flux tower observations in the validation of regional scale moreover three metrics were used to evaluate the accuracy determination coefficient r2 root mean square error rmse and relative root mean square error rrmse which are calculated as follows cheng et al 2022a 2022b 16 r 2 1 1 i 1 n l e m i l e m 2 i 1 n l e o b i l e o b 2 n 1 n m 1 17 r m s e 1 n i 1 n l e m i l e o b i 2 18 r r m s e r m s e l e o b 100 where lemi and leobi are the estimated le and in situ measured le respectively n 125 is the number of samples and m 1 is the number of variables 3 results 3 1 cef method 3 1 1 validation in site scale a total of five aets 09 00 11 00 13 00 15 00 and 17 00 were selected for model input to evaluate the performance of available ef in different times the results was shown in fig 3 and table 3 r2 varied from 0 64 to 0 79 rmse varied from 8 75 to 11 15 w m2 and rrmse varied from 19 72 to 25 14 in xinxiang site the performance in huailai showed slightly higher than xinxiang with r2 varied from 0 87 to 0 92 rmse varied from 9 36 to 11 99 w m2 and rrmse varied from 17 21 to 22 04 in general both the two sites showed that the higher accuracy were found at the 11 00 and 13 00 of aet than other periods the cef method has an acceptable accuracy for le up scaling 3 1 2 application by using satellite data fig 4a presented the performance of cef method by using instantaneous satellite data at 11 00 in general the cef method had a certain error in estimating daily le with rrmse reached 38 96 and rmse and r2 was 30 01 w m2 and 0 76 respectively however it should be noted that the instantaneous le estimation had a certain error as well fig 4b the r2 rmse and rrmse was 0 83 39 66 w m2 and 26 13 respectively the error of instantaneous le estimation at aet account for a large part of daily le estimation error which was more than the error from up scaling method itself be that as it may the up scaling method still have potential to be improved 3 2 dlev method 3 2 1 validation in site scale fig 5 and table 4 presented the results of dlev method performance in up scaling le from instantaneous to daily scale in general dlev method performed a similar accuracy with cef method in which the r2 varied from 0 58 to 0 83 with different aets and rmse varied from 7 67 to 13 01 w m2 rrmse varied from 17 28 to 26 33 in the validation of xinxiang site while in huailai the r2 varied from 0 77 to 0 96 rmse varied from 8 85 to 15 36 w m2 and rrmse varied from 16 27 to 28 24 the accuracy difference derived from various aets was generally larger than that of cef method the aets in the noon 11 00 and 13 00 resulted in a better performance with r2 more than 0 80 and rrmse less than 20 which were better than other aets in both xinxiang and huailai site dlev method could describe the le variation during the day by using only one measured le which is different from cef method fig 6 presented the results of dlev method performance in describing instantaneous le during a day in different aets in general dlev method could describe the le variation well during the daytime in which the r2 was almost exceed 0 40 in the validation of xinxiang site during 8 00 17 00 which was the main period of daytime while in huailai site the r2 was almost exceeded 0 60 during this period regardless aets 3 2 2 application by using satellite data fig 7a presented the dlev method performance in estimating daily le by only using the instantaneous satellite data at 11 00 compared to cef method the accuracy of dlev method had a slight improvement with the r2 rmse and rrmse were 0 79 28 27 w m2 and 36 46 respectively however this method still had a certain error it was worth noting that dlev method could describe the diurnal variation of le and estimate instantaneous le of specified time fig 7b presented the performance of instantaneous le in every half hour from sunrise to sunset which were estimated using dlev method and aet of 11 00 the results showed that the r2 rmse and rrmse were 0 64 24 86 w m2 and 33 49 respectively although it had a certain error it should be noted the error was mainly came from the instantaneous le at 11 00 which showed that rrmse reached 26 13 fig 4b in general dlev method could describe le variation well and estimate instantaneous le of other specified time 3 3 geosynchronous satellite method compared to the cef and dlev which only using instantaneous satellite data at aet geosynchronous satellite gs method provided higher observation frequency without any assumption as shown in fig 8a the gs method performed higher accuracy in daily le estimation than cef and dlev method the r2 rmse and rrmse were 0 83 26 99 w m2 and 34 05 respectively moreover fig 8b showed the accuracy of instantaneous le estimated by using high frequency observation data of himawari 8 and sebal in general it performed an acceptable accuracy with r2 rmse and rrmse were 0 72 25 42 w m2 and 31 59 which was slightly higher than dlev method as described in section 3 2 dlev method could estimate instantaneous le well during the daytime which was further proved by the comparison of the dlev method with gs method fig 9 the comparison of instantaneous le in every half hour from sunrise to sunset suggested that the two methods had a good agreement with the r2 rmse and rrmse were 0 83 10 12 w m2 and 19 42 respectively it should be noted that dlev method performed worse in low le area which were generally occurred at near sunrise or sunset time as shown in green cycle fig 9 which was consistent with the results in section 3 2 1 while the comparison was conducted from 8 00 17 00 the two methods showed higher agreement with the r2 rmse and rrmse was 0 92 14 69 w m2 and 14 56 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 summary in this study three le up scaling methods cef dlev and gs were compared by using flux tower observations for validation moreover they were further applied and compared in regional scale by using satellite data and sebal it should be noted that there are certain errors in flux observations previous studies have demonstrated that ect still have a typical error of approximately 5 20 culf et al 2008 vickers et al 2010 while for regional scale validation by using flux observations the mismatch of ect footprint and satellite data spatial resolution will also cause the errors of up scaling method validation the footprint of the ect generally varied from hundreds to thousands of square meters which was mainly determined by the observation instrument height the turbulence intensity environment terrain and vegetation covers chen et al 2012 cheng et al 2021b damm et al 2020 and it also can be characterized by a footprint probability distribution function when at a fine spatial resolution wang et al 2019 regarding to coarse resolution in this study 2 km the footprint was not easy to be matched accurately additionally different environment and terrain will cause the difference observation accuracy cheng et al 2021a therefore the performance of the two flux towers existed a certain error in the regional scale application based on satellite observations sbeal and the inputs will cause errors besides up scaling methods for example using cef method to estimate daily le had an error with rrmse of 38 96 and that of dlev method was 36 46 in which the instantaneous le estimated by sebal had an error with rrmse of 26 13 fig 4b sebal is a mature algorithm and has been widely used but the complexity of the algorithm itself and several assumptions cause the estimated le have error to different extents cheng et al 2021b long et al 2011 for example the hot cold pixel selection in the process of sensible heat flux calculation of sebal which may cause an error of 50 w m2 of sensible heat flux seguin et al 1999 moreover several studies suggested that the most may induce an error of 10 20 foken 2006 högström and bergström 1996 additionally the uncertainties of sebal inputs also induce the error of results modis data has been widely used for et estimation and resulted in a good performance cheng et al 2021a 2021b in this study mod11 emissivity products which are estimated from land cover types snyder et al 2010 were used for lst estimation at presents few studies evaluated the performance of mod11 emissivity while the mod11 surface temperature products based on emissivity have been proved exist biases of 0 91 3 13 k li et al 2014 moreover the key parameter of sebal brightness temperature from himawari 8 has also been widely used choi and suh 2018 liu et al 2019 yu et al 2019 choi and suh 2018 used himawari 8 data to retrieval land surface temperature and resulted in a bias of 0 45 k liu et al 2019 used himawari 8 data to estimate air temperature and also obtained a good accuracy with a bias of 0 04 in general the remote sensing data used in this study has certain reliability but it will still affect the result of sebal 4 2 errors of cef method currently cef method is a commonly used up scaling method of le some studies used this method for regional evapotranspiration estimation and obtained an acceptable accuracy cheng et al 2020b 2021b similarly the flux tower observations were used for cef method evaluation in this study and the results presented a good agreement with observed value be that as it may many of its assumptions inevitably induced certain errors liu 2021 the cef method firstly assumed that ef stay constant over the daytime but it is not completely accurate crago 1996 the two flux towers xinxiang and huailai observation data presented that ef had a great variation during a day and only keep relative stable during 8 00 16 00 blue area in the fig 10 while in the period from sunrise to 8 00 and 16 00 to sunset the ef was higher than that of daytime i e 11 00 therefore this assumption will theoretically underestimate le gentine et al 2007 used a constant number 1 1 to correct underestimated le which can reduced the systematic underestimation ryu et al 2012 similarly niel et al 2011 introduced a time dependent factors to reduce the systematic underestimation however the determination of these parameters still needs a further discussion liu 2021 besides the calculation of daily rn g was necessary before le retrieval when using cef method generally rn g was assumed varied as a sine curve from 0 to π radians crago 1996 we further discussed the uncertainties derived from this assumption fig 11 in general this method can well estimate the daily rn g with a good agreement with measured value r2 0 90 but remained an error of rrmse 12 37 moreover other studies proposed that daily g ground heat flux can be ignored cheng et al 2021b in general the calculation of rn g has a great potential to be improved as compared to the overall accuracy of le rrmse 17 21 25 14 in table 3 4 3 errors of dlev method accurately describing the diurnal variation of energy flux is of great importance for hydrology and ecosystem monitoring however due to the various weather and vegetation conditions changed the shape of the variation curve is difficult to be determined liu 2021 in this study cosine function was employed to describe le variation and resulted in an acceptable accuracy with r2 reached 0 96 at best liu 2021 used sine and gaussian curve to describe le variation and obtained similar accuracy r2 reached 0 90 at best however this method remained errors to a certain extent several factors may cause the error of this method which are difficult to be avoided previous studies suggested that used potential evapotranspiration pet defined as the evapotranspiration of reference crop can fit the curve better than directly using evapotranspiration et or le which may due to the vegetation status changing is ignored cammalleri et al 2014 similarly the variation curve may perform better when the weather is a clear day during the daytime while suddenly changes of weather such as precipitation will affect the shape of curve wandera et al 2017 which may cause the limited accuracy of dlev method for le up scaling several studies used daily atmospheric transmissivity τ to characterize the sky condition to evaluate the performance of dlev method liu 2021 suggested that when τ 0 6 the curve can well describe the le variation similarly wandera et al 2017 indicates that the condition of τ 0 75 resulted in the highest accuracy it should be noted that dlev method performed poor accuracy r2 lower than 0 40 from the period outside 8 00 17 00 fig 6 while for the period with higher le the simulation accuracy can be guaranteed the aet were often closer to this period which was better for the curve fitting moreover the cosine curve used in this study will presented values near 0 when the time is close to sunrise or sunset however flux tower observations often perform the non closure issue in the period with low value but the low accuracy of this period may have little impact on the daily le estimation which was agree with the previous studies delogu et al 2012 liu 2021 wandera et al 2017 moreover compared to the previous studies of delogu et al 2012 resulted in high accuracy during 11 00 13 00 wandera et al 2017 resulted in high accuracy during 9 00 15 00 and liu 2021 resulted in high accuracy during 11 00 14 00 the dlev method in this study provided a longer period with high accuracy of le simulation 4 4 gs method compared to cef and dlev method the accuracy of gs method was only affected by sebal and without any assumptions however multiple instantaneous le calculations based on sebal inevitably increased the uncertainty of daily le estimation for example the estimation instantaneous le at different time in this study remained errors with rrmse of 31 59 fig 9 which was close to the results of relevant studies cheng et al 2021b 2020c moreover it should be noted that several studies have demonstrated that sebal performed different in various vegetation types cheng et al 2021b jaafar and ahmad 2020 rahimzadegan and janani 2019 however only two flux towers which are located in cropland ecosystem were employed in this study cheng et al 2021b suggested that sebal have the highest accuracy in cropland among the three ecosystems cropland grassland and forest therefore gs method may perform worse in other ecosystems similarly sebal performed different accuracy in various climate zones and terrain cheng et al 2021b thus more sites need to be used in such studies in general gs method can accurately estimate multiple instantaneous le during the daytime because of the high frequency observations moreover high frequency observations can also improve the possibility of obtaining cloudless satellite images currently few studies focus on the le retrieval based on gs in china besides the related parameters required in the sebal are also need to be improved e g land surface temperature choi and suh 2018 and surface albedo damiani et al 2018 which stay at a relative low estimation accuracy overall gs method has a great potential to reach higher accuracy 5 conclusion in this study we used two flux observations and himawari 8 geosynchronous satellite to analyze the three methods for le up scaling from instantaneous to daily scale the results showed that in site scale validation the rrmse of dlev method in estimating daily le varied from 16 27 to 26 33 which was slightly better than that of original cef method rrmse 17 21 25 14 moreover dlev can accurately describe the instantaneous le during the 8 00 17 00 r2 0 4 regardless aets when using satellite data to estimate daily le gs rrmse 34 05 method performed highest accuracy followed by dlev rrmse 36 46 which were all slightly better than cef method rrmse 38 96 while for instantaneous le estimation dlev and gs method presented comparable accuracy however dlev method cannot guarantee the accuracy of the time outside of 8 00 17 00 in general the results in this study can provide a reference for understanding diurnal le variation during a single day additionally other two methods dlev gs were proved to obtain higher accuracy of daily le estimation than original cef method credit authorship

instantaneous le by jointly using satellite observation data in this study sebal model has been widely used for regional le estimation and obtained a good performance cheng et al 2021b 2020c gobbo et al 2019 jaafar and ahmad 2020 mhawej et al 2020 rahimzadegan and janani 2019 sebal model computes the instantaneous le as a residual of the surface energy balance equation eq a1 as follows a1 l e r n

satellite transit time to g the value of c is 0 9 when transmission times was before 12 00 local time lt 1 0 when transmission times was between 12 00 and 14 00 lt and 1 1 when transmission times was between 14 00 and 16 00 lt h was calculated by using eq a10 a10 h ρ a i r c p d t r a where cp unit j kg k is the specific heat of air ρair unit kg m3 is the air density eq a11 smith et al 1991 dt

weather stations uw eq a14 zr is 200 m zeng et al 2008 and z0 m is the surface roughness unit m eq a15 moran and jackson 1991 however since it is hard to calculate dt directly the sebal assumes a linear relationship between dt and surface temperature ts unit k as shown in eq a16 a16 d t a t s b where a and b were solved by selecting the cold and hot pixels in sebal in which the hot pixel was assumed to represent the pixel of bare surfaces or low vegetation covers and have zero le i e h rn g and the cold pixel was assumed to represent the pixel with lush vegetation low temperature or sufficient water supply with zero h i e le rn g the cold and hot pixels were automatedly selected by following several certain rules in this study long et al 2011 for hot pixel firstly the pixels with low ndvi top 10 and high ts top 10 were selected and further select the pixels with cropland covers or bare surfaces from the pixels which were selected in last step and finally select the pixel with highest ts among these pixels as the hot pixel additionally for cold pixel the pixels with high ndvi top 10 and low ts top 10 were selected first and then to select the pixels with the dense vegetation covers generally forest from the pixels which were selected in first step finally select the pixel with lowest ts among these pixels as the cold pixel after determined the cold and hot pixels a and b can be calculated as follows a17 a r n h o t g h o t r a h o t c p ρ a i r h o t t s h o t t s c o l d a18 b a t s c o l d additionally it was worth noting that ra and h are interrelated variables therefore the monin obkhov similarity theory most based monin obkhov length l unit m was introduced to the iterative calculation to obtain the stable values of ra and h the monin obkhov length which is used as a parameter to reflect the turbulent characteristics of the near surface layer eq a19 monin and obukhov 1954 ψm zr is the stability correction function of momentum

several iterations were carried out until the value of h was stable the whole process of monin obkhov correction can be summarized as fig a1 the le can be calculated as a residual after rn g and h

8061,study region spring along the southeast coast of yonaguni island located at the western end of the ryukyu forearc study focus the chemical composition of groundwater including sf6 concentration was investigated to clarify the mechanism of groundwater discharge around sanninudai on the southeast coast of yonaguni island new hydrological insights for the region accurate determination of groundwater flow paths is essential to the conservation and management of groundwater sources and their sustainable use other areas around the world may show similar complexity requiring a review of past findings this possibility indicates the need for re examination of groundwater sources around the world in particular the development of novel analytical methods for chemical components may provide valuable information the chemical composition of spring water on remote islands where anthropogenic activities have little influence should be investigated continuously to monitor the effects of sea level rise caused by global warming keywords yonaguni island spring water discharging mechanism seawater influence apparent residence time 1 introduction people living in the ryukyu islands including yonaguni island rely largely on fresh groundwater lenses as water resources and sustainable use of these lenses is a key issue included in the sixth stage of the united nations sustainable development goals to be achieved by 2030 meeting this goal requires ensuring access to and sustainable management of water and sanitation for the entire population in particular recent global warming has caused sea level to rise leading to seawater intrusion into fresh groundwater lenses jinno and hiroshiro 2006 in urbanized island areas changes in land use and large scale groundwater pumping have led to increasing seawater withdrawal priyantha ranjan et al 2006 thus both global and local factors can impact water resources on islands in this study we focused on the groundwater of a small remote island where few large scale industrial sites are present to find solutions for the global issue of sustainable water use yonaguni island is the westernmost of the ryukyu islands belonging to okinawa prefecture fig 1a and preserves a pristine natural environment that is almost untouched by human hands okinawa prefecture hp 2020 in 1979 okinawa prefecture investigated the groundwater quality and geology of yonaguni island to evaluate the feasibility of its use as a water resource kurokawa et al 1979 most terrestrial water on the island is held in several groundwater basins separated by faults within the ryukyu limestone formation kurokawa et al 1979 water chemistry is roughly classified into seawater type and bicarbonate lime type the former is found in low elevation areas near the coast while most water resources are the latter type kurokawa et al 1979 based on the natural water chemistry agata 1995 found that all terrestrial water including surface spring and well water was contaminated with seawater or contained sea salt and the seawater component was especially pronounced in waters near the coast terrestrial water in the limestone area was rich in dissolved components especially calcium ca and bicarbonate hco3 derived from dissolution of limestone terrestrial water in silicate areas was diluted by fresh water and the main dissolved components were sodium na and chloride cl the concentration of dissolved silica si was relatively high for all waters suggesting interaction with the yaeyama group the basement rock of this area which is composed of sand and mud in alternating layers the concentrations of nitrate no and sulfate so4 2 were high in waters in the vicinity of agricultural lands which may be due to fertilizer contamination the concentrations of phosphate no3 and potassium k were high in waters near residential areas which may be due to the effect of domestic wastewater the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic ratios of the terrestrial water are higher than continental water from china and the main island of japan which may be due to latitudinal effects agata and satake 1997 agata et al 2011 agata 2015 in this study the concentration of sulfur hexafluoride sf6 which has not been used in previous studies was measured in groundwater to elucidate groundwater flow pathways sf6 came into use as an agent for electric arc suppression in the 1960 s due to its strong insulating properties but has been subject to emission control under the kyoto protocol since 1997 as it is a very powerful greenhouse gas at present atmospheric concentrations are still following the increasing trend that began around 1960 making it theoretically possible to estimate the time at which groundwater was recharged by calculating the equilibrium concentration at the time that it last contacted the atmosphere e g bauer et al 2001 sakakibara et al 2017 for example groundwater has a residence time of 2 14 years on tarama island a small remote okinawan island yoshimoto et al 2016 the residence time of spring and groundwater in the chubu region of japan s main island is 4 32 years asai et al 2011 and the residence time of shallow and deep groundwater in the kumamoto region is 36 to 55 years kagabu et al 2017 estimates of groundwater age will provide more detailed information about the flow of groundwater through the ground nevertheless methodologies based on the use of isotopes in a full spectrum of hydrological problems encountered in water resource assessment development and management activities are already scientifically established and are an integral part of many water resource investigations and environmental studies barbieri 2019 in addition to this we also analyzed the newly available analytes in recent years sf6 concentration and compare them with past values as well as summarized the findings based on the new analyses in this study the chemical composition of groundwater including sf6 concentration was investigated to clarify the mechanism of groundwater discharge around sanninudai on the southeast coast of yonaguni island 2 study area and hydrological setting yonaguni island 24 27 n 123 2 e is located at the westernmost end of the ryukyu forearc west of the japanese islands 170 km east of taiwan and 130 km west of ishigaki island fig 1a the island is 11 km long from east to west 4 km long from north to south 27 5 km in circumference and 28 5 km2 in area fig 1b the climate of yonaguni island is classified as subtropical with a mean temperature of 18 5 28 9 c with a mean annual temperature of 24 0 c and mean annual precipitation of about 2300 2400 mm japan meteorological agency 2021 the region is known as a typhoon prone area and typhoons approach yonaguni island an average of four times a year causing the island s plants and trees to wither and die from the storms and spray from the sea agata 1995 precipitation is concentrated in the months of august to october when these typhoons arrive and during the rainy season from may to june in summer the area is covered by the pacific high and in winter it is dominated by continental air masses the wind direction is predominantly from the south from may to august and from the north northeast from september to april agata 1995 japan meteorological agency 2021 yonaguni island is above the plate boundary where the philippine sea plate is subducting beneath the eurasian plate fig 1b okinawa trough located at the north end of the ryukyu arc is a back arc basin in the rifting stage sibuet et al 1987 and yonaguni island is near the western end of the okinawa trough fig 1b in the okinawa trough hydrothermal activity has been observed in several submarine knolls fig 1b fujikura et al 2001 miyazaki et al 2017 watanabe 2001 yonaguni island is located in the uplifting zone of the forearc fig 1b and is a non volcanic island as are iriomote ishigaki and the miyako islands rather than an island of the volcanic front or the rift zone of the back arc letouzey and kimura 1986 the geology of yonaguni island was first summarized by sakai et al 1978 and discussed in more detail by yazaki 1982 zaha 2008 summarizes the results in an easy to understand manner and a summary of the results is presented below the basement rock of the island is comprised of the miocene yaeyama group sedimentary formations which contain sand and mud transported from the eurasian continent sakai et al 1978 zaha 2009 yazaki 1982 the thickness of yaeyama group formations is up to ca 250 m which is overlaid with an unconformity by the pleistocene ryukyu group which is subdivided into the donan formation and ryukyu limestone formation fig 1c the donan formation is sedimentary and 30 m thick comprised mainly of fine grained quartz sands from the yaeyama group interspersed with small conglomerates of sandstone ryukyu limestone formation is the main formation of this group and has a thickness of 100 m it shows marked differences in stratum thickness and lithology among regions which has been interpreted as evidence that the sedimentary environment was drastically altered by intermittent faulting during the uplift of the yaeyama group sakai et al 1978 zaha 2009 sakai et al 1978 yazaki 1982 the urabu sand and gravel formation is characterized by pebbly gravel from the yaeyama group and brown clay is its main component the thickness of this layer has not yet been reported the uplift limestone is a terrace along the coast of the island at an elevation of 1 10 m the layer thickness is 10 m and the radiocarbon age of the coral is 39 300 2900 ybp suggesting that it formed during the late pleistocene sakai et al 1978 zaha 2009 sakai et al 1978 yazaki 1982 other sediments are holocene in age and are coastal deposits such as beach rock and dune sand layers fig 1c sakai et al 1978 zaha 2009 sakai et al 1978 yazaki 1982 a normal fault with a maximum vertical displacement of more than 160 m extends in a northeast southwest to northwest southeast direction cutting through the yaeyama and ryukyu groups red lines in fig 1c sakai et al 1978 zaha 2009 sakai et al 1978 yazaki 1982 in yonaguni island large scale drilling and electric exploration were carried out in the 1970 s for the purpose of securing a water source from groundwater and studying its potential and the groundwater level and depth of the basement rock were clarified fig 1d and e kurokawa et al 1979 moreover the results of pumping tests using drilled wells indicate that groundwater is zoned into the highly permeable ryukyu group with the yaeyama group as the basal impermeable layer kurokawa et al 1979 furthermore those aquifers are divided into five major groundwater basins by basement rock undulations and faults barumi taburu north coast kubura and higawa fig 1d the five groups are hydrologically subdivided into twelve basins minami ndan barumi kumma kumbaru taburu mutaburu tatagan tobaru kubura tarumai and higawa fig 1d kurokawa et al 1979 the sanninudai springs the target of this study are located at the boundary between the barumi a 2 in fig 1d and minami ndan a 1 in fig 1d sub basins within the barumi basin fig 1d kurokawa et al 1979 recognized the springs as eastern outlets of barumi basin groundwater kurokawa et al 1979 the barumi basin extends 1 km north south and 1 km east west beneath the northwestern side of sanninudai and is bordered on the west by the minami ndan groundwater basin fig 1d the groundwater level in the barumi basin is only 0 5 m above sea level in the east and rises gradually to 5 m in the west fig 1d kurokawa et al 1979 the deepest elevation of the basin is 60 m fig 1e and tidal fluctuation of groundwater level has been observed more than 300 m inland from the coastline kurokawa et al 1979 the minami ndan groundwater basin is located upstream of the barumi basin and its groundwater level ranges from 10 to 30 m fig 1d with a basement elevation from 30 40 m kurokawa et al 1979 the possibility of a groundwater waterfall under the ground has been suggested as the water level contour line is dense near the boundary between the minami ndan groundwater basin and the barumi groundwater basin kurokawa et al 1979 3 sampling 3 1 sampling sites at sanninudai located on the southeast coast of yonaguni island the ryukyu group and yaeyama group come into contact with a normal fault fig 1c springs arise from the bottom of the ryukyu group sediments and moisten the talus sediments below the ryukyu group photo 1 on these moistened sediments vegetation grows thickly photo 1a the ryukyu group is inclined to the east northeast and the springs are designated ysc ysb yse ysa and ysd ordered by distance from the fault zone photo 1a and table 1 ysa and ysd flow from the basement gravel layer of the ryukyu group donan formation and they flow noisily unlike other springs ysc ysb and yse accoding to kurokawa et al 1979 they are called the largest spring in yonaguni island mident and clearly have a higher flow rate 1000 l min kurokawa et al 1979 than the other springs photo 1b and d ysc ysb and yse are fairly low flow springs where the seeps can barely be found by following them through the wet grassland and the outlets are located in fault gouge covered with vegetation photo 1c ysc however dries up in october due to low rainfall on the island during the summer season and we were unable to sample ysc in october table 1 we also collected surface water from a river in the mountains to obtain representative samples of the meteoric water that falls on yonaguni island site ya table 1 and fig 1c the sampling site is named angai miduchi and is located to the south of mt urabu the highest mountain on yonaguni island this area is considered one of the sites where rainwater collects after falling on mt urabu downstream of the sampling site along the river a limestone formation is present on the bank of the river fig 1c flow becomes abundant and tufa can be found on the walls around the sampling site we observed the urabu sand and gravel formation fig 1c 3 2 water sampling water was sampled from the springs and river on three occasions 25 april 18 june and 27 october 2019 table 1 we measured the water temperature and ph and then collected unfiltered sf6 samples from ysa and ya in 300 ml brown bottles water was collected from all sites using plastic syringes fitted with disc filters 0 45 µm mesh and filtered into polyethylene bottles samples for anion concentration analysis were stored in a refrigerator until analysis in the

and the average groundwater of yonaguni island is shown as a dark blue dashed line in fig 2m n and o mixing line in addition the approximate line drawn from seawater to the data of this study is shown by the black dashed line and its y intercept is shown by the red star fig 2m and n fig 2o shows the relationship between δ2hh2o and δ18oh2o the black solid line is the local meteoric water line lmwl on yonaguni island agata and satake 1997 agata et al 2011 agata 2015 where the y intercept d excess value is reported to be 20 5 in winter and 10 in summer the line connecting the edge components of the spring water red star and seawater determined in fig 2m and 2 n is shown as a black dashed line fig 2o the relationship between na and cl concentrations indicates that the spring waters sampled are contaminated with seawater fig 2a as noted in previous studies agata 1995 kurokawa et al 1979 on the other hand the concentrations of k and lithium li which are alkali metals like na are plotted below the dilution line in the spring waters suggesting that they were removed from the water via processes such as cation exchange reactions on clay minerals fig 2b and c however it has been suggested that k and li are supplied to some river waters and groundwater basins indicating decomposition and leaching from solid phases such as clay minerals in the surrounding strata in the case of k the effect of agricultural fertilizers used in the area should also be considered fig 2b for all terrestrial water the points fell in a region of higher ca concentration than the dilution line of seawater as reported in previous studies agata 1995 kurokawa et al 1979 which may be due to dissolution of the ryukyu limestone fig 2d in terms of other bivalent cations magnesium mg is slightly depleted in spring water relative to diluted seawater fig 2e but this this difference appears to be mostly within the range of analytical error on the other hand strontium sr is enriched in all terrestrial waters relative to diluted seawater fig 2f which also seems to be the effect of the dissolution of the ryukyu limestone as shown in ca thus the components that cannot be explained by dilution of seawater alone are considered to have a surrounding solid phase as a source fig 2d e and f points of our results for cl and so4 2 the second most abundant anion in seawater were plotted along the mixing line with seawater fig 2g suggesting that the environment of the flow path was not in so reductive condition that sulfate reduction occurs fig 2g no3 was not considerably reduced in any terrestrial waters and was enriched compared with seawater likely due to fertilizer usage fig 2h land uses in the watershed of the barumi groundwater basin group which extends west northwest from sanninudai is 30 cultivated fields 30 broad leaved forests and 30 wild grasslands okinawa prefecture hp 2020 chemical fertilizers and compost used in agriculture may impact terrestrial water chemistry the world health organization and japanese environmental standard value is 10 mg l as no3 n 700 µm as no3 organization 2017 although the values obtained here are lower than the standard fig 2h it is essential to continue monitoring their changes alkalinity can be considered the concentration of hco3 as the ph values of all waters sampled in this study were nearly neutral table 2 the alkalinity of all waters was plotted above the mixing line with seawater fig 2i as suggested in previous studies agata 1995 kurokawa et al 1979 hco3 is supplied along with ca fig 2d from the dissolution of calcium carbonate caco3 derived from the ryukyu limestone in the ryukyu group which is widely distributed on the island fig 1c si concentrations for all terrestrial waters were higher than the dilution line of seawater fig 2j this result suggests that all terrestrial water is supplied with si although the solubility of si the main component of the rock is relatively low si leaching from rocks can affect si concentrations fig 2j boron b concentrations were plotted in a region slightly lower than the dilution line of seawater suggesting that b is affected by a reaction process that removes it before the water emerges similar to k and li fig 2k on the other hand iron fe is plotted higher than the dilution line suggesting that this relatively common constituent of rocks is supplied from the surrounding rocks and clays in the same manner as si fig 2l the silicate rocks in yonaguni island are considered to be the yaeyama group the urabu sand and gravel formation or the donan formation distributed near the discharge of the springs water isotope ratios δ2hh2o and δ18oh2o values are displaced below the mixing line between seawater and the average groundwater of yonaguni island fig 2m and n here we use the average groundwater values of 19 5 3 6 for δ2hh2o and 4 5 0 4 for δ18oh2o for yonaguni island agata and satake 1997 agata et al 2011 agata 2015 water isotope ratios generally do not change due to chemical reactions at low temperatures but only through mixing with fluids that have different isotope ratios this pattern suggests that both the hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios observed here may be affected by mixing with fluids with low isotope ratios relative to the average groundwater in yonaguni island fig 2m and n assuming the existence of such a source of fresh water the approximate lines of the data are shown as red dashed lines with a mixing line through the seawater to obtain the value of the cl 0 intercept fig 2m and n the cl 0 intercept shows values of δ2hh2o 26 3 0 2 and δ18oh2o 5 34 0 02 respectively fig 2 m and 2 n the spring water can be explained by a mixture of about 5 seawater and fresh water with these edge components fig 2 m 2 n and 2o almost all the data for these springs lie on a straight line with similar y intercepts and none of the data are remarkably close to the summer lmwl or winter lmwl fig 2o this indicates that the springs are not affected by significant seasonal variations suggesting that the groundwater residence time may be longer than approximately 5 years małoszewski et al 1983 in addition the water with lower values of any isotope ratio than the average groundwater value can be explained at least in part by the effect of the altitude of the water source for example a value of 0 25 100 m for δ18oh2o has been reported for central japan waseda and nakai 1983 and values of 0 4 to 0 2 100 m for δ18oh2o at mid latitudes are generally known to be lower than those at lower latitudes siegenthaler 1979 the closest reported values to yonaguni island are 0 17 100 m yamanaka et al 2009 and 0 1 100 m agata et al 2011 on yakushima island here the δ18oh2o of the edge component of the spring water at sunninudai obtained by this study is 5 34 which is about 0 84 lower than the average value 4 5 of groundwater in yonaguni island assuming an altitude effect of 0 4 to 0 1 100 m the origin of the fresh water is estimated to be from an altitude of 210 840 m however the highest peak on yonaguni island is mt urabu 231 m fig 1d which rises just north of sunninudai suggesting that the fresh water is coming from such an altitude thus it is suggested that the spring water at the sanninudai is a mixture of fresh water from the altitude and about 5 seawater 5 2 quantitative estimation of the seawater contribution to seeping fluids the spring waters at sanninudai are formed through mixing of two end members seawater and the fresh water from mt urabu as discussed in the former section among these end members the second is a freshwater source and therefore the seawater influence can be calculated from the concentrations of salt components cl and na show a strong correlation fig 2a other components show impacts from end members other than seawater and freshwater fig 2 but cl and na are affected by only these two end members cl and na are very highly soluble and are present in seawater at very high levels na accounts for about 30 of the solutes in seawater and is the second most dissolved chemical species in seawater after cl cl is the most dissolved chemical species in seawater and accounts for about 55 of the solutes in seawater turekian 1968 therefore even if they are diluted their concentration remains sufficiently high for measurement in addition as these elements are not used in the major metabolic processes of microorganisms they are negligibly affected by removal processes or factors other than mixing with meteoric water thus the extent to which seawater affects spring water can be quantitatively estimated from the concentration of cl or na in the spring water in a strict sense however na can form precipitation when mixing of different water with different chemistry occurs for example when limestone water is mixed with seawater an oversaturation can occur and nahco3 could precipitate this might be the reason why the plots for the spring waters are slightly below the dilution line of seawater fig 2a therefore we shall use the concentration of cl to determine the mixing ratio of seawater as shown in the following equation eq 1 1 rsw clobs clsw 100 where rsw is the percentage of seawater in spring water and clobs and clsw are the cl concentrations in spring water mmol l and seawater mmol l respectively the concentration of cl in seawater clsw was determined using the concentration of cl in international association for the physical sciences of the ocean standard seawater 545 mmol l which was also used to determine the concentration of cl in samples gieskes et al 1991 gamo and gieskes 1992 the resulting estimates are summarized in table 3 among the five springs sampled in this study only ysd had a low seawater percentage of 3 while the other springs were around 5 seawater table 3 for reference we calculated concentrations in the same manner using previously collected data and listed the results in table 3 those results show that values vary from year to year with seawater contents of 1 5 in 1995 and 2 3 in 1979 the exact location where these samples were collected is unclear and therefore we cannot directly compare our results with previous measurements but seawater percentage appears to be increasing over time this process may not be a gradual progression and insufficient data are available to investigate variations over time so further data are needed to assess temporal changes however the effect of seawater on the spring water around sanninudai is clearly stronger than in the past therefore close monitoring is necessary to determine the relationship of this shift with the concurrent rise in sea level due to global warming notably the magnitude of seawater mixing in the spring water sampled in this study is ordered ysc ysb yse ysa ysd table 3 this pattern is consistent with the geographic positions of the springs ordered from south ysc to north ysd photo 1a this geographic distribution suggests that the freshwater source is located in the north and the influence of seawater is stronger to the south 5 3 estimation of the mean residence time of spring water using sf6 concentration next residence time of the groundwater is estimated using the sf6 concentration in the groundwater the groundwater is assumed to be piston flow without mixing with the old groundwater also it is not the actual residence time but only the residence time indicated by the tracer the best way to estimate the residence time of groundwater is to use the lumped parameter model małoszewski and zuber 1982 especially when considering groundwater with an expected residence time that is less than 5 years however the concentration constant model requires several years of observation data of tracer concentration which cannot be applied in this study however since we can only obtain the residence time as a weighted average of sf6 in the sample volume at least we will refer to it as the mean residence time chambers et al 2019 suckow 2014 sf6 concentrations in groundwater under the assumption of atmospheric equilibrium with past atmospheric sf6 concentrations were calculated from sf6 in the atmosphere usgs 2022 the recharge altitude set to 231 m above sea level at mt urabu and the recharge temperature set to the mean temperature of 24 0 c at yonaguni island japan meteorological agency 2021 and the results are shown in fig 3 wanninkhof et al 1991 busenberg and plummer 2000 darling et al 2012 as shown in fig 3 the sf6 concentrations in groundwater in equilibrium with sf6 in the atmosphere have increased gradually from 1975 0 1 fmol l to the present 2 4 fmol l the sf6 concentrations average value 2 2 fmol l in the sampled spring water were 2 22 2 20 and 2 18 fmol l for samples collected in april june and october respectively table 2 the sf6 concentration in the original groundwater should be corrected based on mixing of 5 seawater at atmospheric equilibrium as seawater was mixed into the groundwater at approximately that level as described above table 3 the corrected values are consistent with 2 2 fmol l within the error range of our measurement method converting this value to the age of the groundwater at atmospheric equilibrium we obtained a result of 2016 dotted line in fig 3 which is could be older due to groundwater fluctuations caused by the typhoon the effect of excess air ea must also be taken into account which is an unavoidable error caused by the dissolution of air bubbles during recharge heaton and vogel 1981 due to this ea effect sf6 concentrations can be observed to be three to five times higher gooddy et al 2006 darling et al 2012 taking this into account assuming that the maximum five fold effect was observed the observed concentration in this study could be corrected to 0 44 fmol l which may have been in equilibrium with the atmosphere around 1986 dashed line in fig 3 furthermore as shown in the previous section no seasonal variation was observed suggesting that the residence time is likely to be more than 5 years these results indicate that the mean residence time of the spring water is more than 5 years the mean residence time of more than 5 years fits relatively well with values measured along the coast of the island 2 14 years yoshimoto et al 2016 where a similar setting of ryukyu limestone and impermeable base occurs and thus is likely a reasonable value 5 4 degree of caco3 saturation in spring water the relationships of ca concentration to hco3 concentration in terrestrial waters including spring river and groundwater are shown in fig 4a as described above the concentration of hco3 is used as an approximation of alkalinity as the ph of the spring water is near 7 table 2 most terrestrial water data were plotted around the 1 2 line of ca versus hco3 concentration blue dashed line in fig 4a this relationship may be due to an increase in the concentration of ca and hco3 associated with dissolution by groundwater of ryukyu limestone in the ryukyu group which is widely distributed on yonaguni island eq 2 2 caco3 co2 h2o ca2 2hco3 in the soil decomposition of organic matter occurs according to eq 3 forming carbon dioxide fang 2010 3 ch2o n no2 nco2 nh2o rainwater that has reached equilibrium with atmospheric carbon dioxide during its descent into the atmosphere falls on the ground and carbon dioxide generated in the soil eq 3 is dissolved in the rainwater during infiltration through the ground to become groundwater which leads to dissolution of caco3 as described by eq 2 on the other hand outside of these linear relationships most springs red points in fig 4a and some groundwater samples were plotted in areas indicating a high proportion of ca conversely a few points have ca versus hco3 concentrations lower than 1 2 fig 4a these results suggest that a source with a ratio of ca to hco3 concentration higher than 1 2 affects spring water in the sampling area fig 4a the most likely candidate for such a source is seawater or sea salt aerosol particles as suggested in fig 2 the concentrations of ca and hco3 in seawater were 10 mmol l and 2 4 mmol l respectively and the dilution line of seawater in fig 4a is shown as a light blue dashed line as indicated by the dilution line the ratio of ca to hco3 concentration in seawater is greater than 1 2 with an excess of ca this finding suggests that seawater may drive the data from springs with high ca ratios away from the 1 2 line of ca to hco3 concentration to determine whether dissolution equilibrium was reached for caco3 the saturation index si for each sample was calculated using the geochemist s workbench gwb 14 hulinks parkhurst and appelo 1999 the calculation was conducted using observed temperature and ph values table 2 and the activity coefficient and equilibrium constants were obtained from the gwb database si values were calculated using the equilibrium constant for the dissolution equilibrium of caco3 k 5 k ca2 hco3 h mmol l and 6 q ca2 obs hco3 obs h obs mmol l for the observed value q then the logarithm of the ratio of q k was calculated as the si value stumm and morgan 1996 7 si log q k the obtained si values are summarized in table 2 if the si value is negative the sample is unsaturated with respect to caco3 on the other hand positive values indicate supersaturated samples in fig 4b the hco3 concentration is used as the abscissa and the calculated saturation si is plotted as the ordinate at si 0 indicating saturation a dashed line is shown fig 4b this graph shows that some groundwater samples containing ya are below the saturation line indicating that those samples are unsaturated for caco3 while all spring waters are supersaturated for caco3 fig 4b in particular groundwater in the barumi and minami ndan groundwater basins was supersaturated similar to water sampled at springs fig 4b only six points around ya1995 meet the saturation condition fig 4b these data correspond to hco3 concentrations around 3 mm fig 4 above which supersaturation tends to occur fig 4 conversely hco3 concentrations lower than 2 5 mm tended to be unsaturated fig 4 this result indicates that points with hco3 concentrations above a threshold of 3 mm are oversaturated and lower than 2 5 mm are unsaturated fig 4a even if the data fall along a dissolution line representing ca and hco3 at a ratio of 1 2 the ca levels in springs such as ysa ysb ysc ysd and yse obtained in this study hereafter ys2019 are above the dissolution line in fig 4a and also appear supersaturated in fig 4b thus caco3 is likely in a supersaturated state due to excess ca input from seawater on the other hand groundwater data for the barumi basin and minami ndan basin indicate supersaturation of caco3 as shown in fig 4b although the points are along the dissolution line of caco3 shown in fig 4a this result indicates that groundwater in the barumi groundwater basin and the minami ndan groundwater basin is supersaturated with caco3 due to the influence of seawater and is also controlled by the dissolution of caco3 as its concentrations fall along the dissolution line of caco3 fig 4 this finding suggests that the groundwater in these basins receives abnormally high ca concentrations from seawater and that the dissolution of caco3 is progressing toward equilibrium indicating a buffering effect ys2019 samples do not reflect this buffering effect indicating that they may discharge before the buffering effect occurs and thus suggesting that seawater components may have been mixed with the groundwater just before discharge for example it is possible that the influence of sea salt particles is limited to surface soils around the discharge outlets and that the sea salt is added immediately before discharge on the other hand although the groundwater of the barumi and minami ndan basins is exposed to seawater it also contains dissolved caco3 the main component of ryukyu limestone in the surrounding ryukyu group which shows a buffering effect thus based on the degree of saturation of caco3 in the groundwater and spring waters we can explore differences in mixing and dissolution process between groundwater and spring waters prior to their discharge 5 5 discharge mechanism of springs in sanninudai on the southeast coast of yonaguni island fig 5 shows a schematic diagram of groundwater flow in sanninudai on the southeastern coast of yonaguni island considering the chemical composition of spring water and groundwater figs 2 4 the basement formation fig 1e the yaeyama group which is the base of the impermeable layer and the ryukyu limestone which is the aquifer and the elevation of the groundwater table fig 1d the groundwater basin known as the barumi basin is located on the north side of the spring area at an elevation of 60 m fig 1e kurokawa et al 1979 the groundwater level around the spring area has fallen almost to sea level at 0 5 m fig 1d kurokawa et al 1979 on the other hand the elevation of the surrounding area is 50 m according to the land use map okinawa prefecture hp 2020 corresponding to the height of the outcrop shown in photo 1 based on these levels a cross sectional diagram of the groundwater basin north of the spring area was constructed and is presented in fig 5a due to the high permeability of the ryukyu limestone within the ryukyu group kurokawa et al 1979 water rarely stays as groundwater for a long time but flows until it reaches the groundwater basin fig 5a in addition as tidal fluctuations extend more than 300 m inland kurokawa et al 1979 seawater intrusion into the barumi basin is likely the ratio of the ca to hco3 concentration is 1 2 fig 4 suggesting that caco3 is approaching equilibrium through the dissolution of caco3 rather than invasion of seawater as illustrated in fig 4 these results are visualized in fig 5a the structure of the groundwater around the spring area is shown in fig 5b the groundwater is supplied as rainwater at mt urabu and takes at least five years to reach the area around the spring area in the vicinity of the spring area the elevation remains almost unchanged at 50 m but the base height rises to 40 m fig 1e kurokawa et al 1979 thus the groundwater level is 10 m fig 1d kurokawa et al 1979 based on our finding that the spring sites were in the range of 10 15 m table 1 we inferred the subsurface structure and water flow pattern as shown in fig 5b the equilibrium state of the spring water for caco3 showed that ys2019 waters were supersaturated with caco3 suggesting that the surface soil around the discharge point of the springs was affected by seawater which entered the water just before discharge fig 5b spring water seeps out from the donan gravel layer which is the basal portion of the ryukyu group the donan gravel occurs in three layers photo 1a ysd is located at the highest layer ysa is at the second layer and ysb ysc and yse are at the third gravel layer buried in talus sediments photo 1a in addition the flow rates of ysa and ysd appeared to decrease during the summer season and flow stopped at ysc suggesting that ysc is the terminal outlet farthest from the spring water source as the chemical effect of seawater is highest in ysc and lower in spring water collected in the north ysc ysb yse ysa ysd table 3 we propose that groundwater is supplied to the second gravel layer containing ysa spring water through the uppermost gravel layer containing ysd before reaching ysc which is located in the southernmost area shown in photo 1 fig 5b the yaeyama group slopes downward to the north kurokawa et al 1979 reaching an elevation of 60 m as shown in fig 5a thus although the spring is considered an outlet of the barumi groundwater basin kurokawa et al 1979 it would be more accurate to describe it as an outlet of the minami ndan groundwater basin such accurate determination of groundwater flow paths is essential to the conservation and management of groundwater sources and their sustainable use other areas around the world may show similar complexity requiring a review of past findings this possibility indicates the need for re examination of groundwater sources around the world in particular the development of novel analytical methods for chemical components may provide valuable information the chemical composition of spring water on remote islands where anthropogenic activities have little influence should be investigated continuously to monitor the effects of sea level rise caused by global warming 6 conclusions spring water was collected from sanninudai on the southeastern coast of yonaguni island in the southern ryukyu forearc and various chemical and isotopic constituents were investigated to infer the groundwater flow pathways the spring water contained 3 5 seawater components suggesting influences from sea salt particles or seawater the isotopic composition of the spring water indicates a fresh water supply from a higher elevation suggesting that it was supplied by precipitation on mt urabu which is located immediately to the north of the spring water the estimated date at which the rainwater was in atmospheric equilibrium based on sf6 concentrations was around 1986 2016 indicating that water is retained for at least three years after becoming groundwater and losing contact with the atmosphere the lack of seasonal variation in the isotope ratios of the water suggests that the water may have been retained for more than five years all sampled springs were supersaturated with caco3 although excess ca could be supplied from seawater to the springs equilibrium would be reached eventually however the springs were not in equilibrium this result suggests that the effect of seawater may be limited to the surface soil around the discharge outlets and that equilibrium with ca newly supplied before discharge had not been reached based on these findings we constructed a conceptual diagram of groundwater flow in the vicinity of the spring area the spring group at sanninudai has been considered an outlet on the east coast of the barumi groundwater basin kurokawa et al 1979 but is more appropriately considered an outlet on the east coast of the minami ndan groundwater basin considering its elevation the importance of accurately understanding the groundwater flow paths have been demonstrated by this study in the future we will conduct some borehole investigations and electrical surveys to update the data of groundwater level and depth of the foundation in addition the seasonal variation of discharge rate should be monitored and the influence of precipitation in the summer season should also be quantitatively clarified credit authorship contribution

8061,study region spring along the southeast coast of yonaguni island located at the western end of the ryukyu forearc study focus the chemical composition of groundwater including sf6 concentration was investigated to clarify the mechanism of groundwater discharge around sanninudai on the southeast coast of yonaguni island new hydrological insights for the region accurate determination of groundwater flow paths is essential to the conservation and management of groundwater sources and their sustainable use other areas around the world may show similar complexity requiring a review of past findings this possibility indicates the need for re examination of groundwater sources around the world in particular the development of novel analytical methods for chemical components may provide valuable information the chemical composition of spring water on remote islands where anthropogenic activities have little influence should be investigated continuously to monitor the effects of sea level rise caused by global warming keywords yonaguni island spring water discharging mechanism seawater influence apparent residence time 1 introduction people living in the ryukyu islands including yonaguni island rely largely on fresh groundwater lenses as water resources and sustainable use of these lenses is a key issue included in the sixth stage of the united nations sustainable development goals to be achieved by 2030 meeting this goal requires ensuring access to and sustainable management of water and sanitation for the entire population in particular recent global warming has caused sea level to rise leading to seawater intrusion into fresh groundwater lenses jinno and hiroshiro 2006 in urbanized island areas changes in land use and large scale groundwater pumping have led to increasing seawater withdrawal priyantha ranjan et al 2006 thus both global and local factors can impact water resources on islands in this study we focused on the groundwater of a small remote island where few large scale industrial sites are present to find solutions for the global issue of sustainable water use yonaguni island is the westernmost of the ryukyu islands belonging to okinawa prefecture fig 1a and preserves a pristine natural environment that is almost untouched by human hands okinawa prefecture hp 2020 in 1979 okinawa prefecture investigated the groundwater quality and geology of yonaguni island to evaluate the feasibility of its use as a water resource kurokawa et al 1979 most terrestrial water on the island is held in several groundwater basins separated by faults within the ryukyu limestone formation kurokawa et al 1979 water chemistry is roughly classified into seawater type and bicarbonate lime type the former is found in low elevation areas near the coast while most water resources are the latter type kurokawa et al 1979 based on the natural water chemistry agata 1995 found that all terrestrial water including surface spring and well water was contaminated with seawater or contained sea salt and the seawater component was especially pronounced in waters near the coast terrestrial water in the limestone area was rich in dissolved components especially calcium ca and bicarbonate hco3 derived from dissolution of limestone terrestrial water in silicate areas was diluted by fresh water and the main dissolved components were sodium na and chloride cl the concentration of dissolved silica si was relatively high for all waters suggesting interaction with the yaeyama group the basement rock of this area which is composed of sand and mud in alternating layers the concentrations of nitrate no and sulfate so4 2 were high in waters in the vicinity of agricultural lands which may be due to fertilizer contamination the concentrations of phosphate no3 and potassium k were high in waters near residential areas which may be due to the effect of domestic wastewater the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic ratios of the terrestrial water are higher than continental water from china and the main island of japan which may be due to latitudinal effects agata and satake 1997 agata et al 2011 agata 2015 in this study the concentration of sulfur hexafluoride sf6 which has not been used in previous studies was measured in groundwater to elucidate groundwater flow pathways sf6 came into use as an agent for electric arc suppression in the 1960 s due to its strong insulating properties but has been subject to emission control under the kyoto protocol since 1997 as it is a very powerful greenhouse gas at present atmospheric concentrations are still following the increasing trend that began around 1960 making it theoretically possible to estimate the time at which groundwater was recharged by calculating the equilibrium concentration at the time that it last contacted the atmosphere e g bauer et al 2001 sakakibara et al 2017 for example groundwater has a residence time of 2 14 years on tarama island a small remote okinawan island yoshimoto et al 2016 the residence time of spring and groundwater in the chubu region of japan s main island is 4 32 years asai et al 2011 and the residence time of shallow and deep groundwater in the kumamoto region is 36 to 55 years kagabu et al 2017 estimates of groundwater age will provide more detailed information about the flow of groundwater through the ground nevertheless methodologies based on the use of isotopes in a full spectrum of hydrological problems encountered in water resource assessment development and management activities are already scientifically established and are an integral part of many water resource investigations and environmental studies barbieri 2019 in addition to this we also analyzed the newly available analytes in recent years sf6 concentration and compare them with past values as well as summarized the findings based on the new analyses in this study the chemical composition of groundwater including sf6 concentration was investigated to clarify the mechanism of groundwater discharge around sanninudai on the southeast coast of yonaguni island 2 study area and hydrological setting yonaguni island 24 27 n 123 2 e is located at the westernmost end of the ryukyu forearc west of the japanese islands 170 km east of taiwan and 130 km west of ishigaki island fig 1a the island is 11 km long from east to west 4 km long from north to south 27 5 km in circumference and 28 5 km2 in area fig 1b the climate of yonaguni island is classified as subtropical with a mean temperature of 18 5 28 9 c with a mean annual temperature of 24 0 c and mean annual precipitation of about 2300 2400 mm japan meteorological agency 2021 the region is known as a typhoon prone area and typhoons approach yonaguni island an average of four times a year causing the island s plants and trees to wither and die from the storms and spray from the sea agata 1995 precipitation is concentrated in the months of august to october when these typhoons arrive and during the rainy season from may to june in summer the area is covered by the pacific high and in winter it is dominated by continental air masses the wind direction is predominantly from the south from may to august and from the north northeast from september to april agata 1995 japan meteorological agency 2021 yonaguni island is above the plate boundary where the philippine sea plate is subducting beneath the eurasian plate fig 1b okinawa trough located at the north end of the ryukyu arc is a back arc basin in the rifting stage sibuet et al 1987 and yonaguni island is near the western end of the okinawa trough fig 1b in the okinawa trough hydrothermal activity has been observed in several submarine knolls fig 1b fujikura et al 2001 miyazaki et al 2017 watanabe 2001 yonaguni island is located in the uplifting zone of the forearc fig 1b and is a non volcanic island as are iriomote ishigaki and the miyako islands rather than an island of the volcanic front or the rift zone of the back arc letouzey and kimura 1986 the geology of yonaguni island was first summarized by sakai et al 1978 and discussed in more detail by yazaki 1982 zaha 2008 summarizes the results in an easy to understand manner and a summary of the results is presented below the basement rock of the island is comprised of the miocene yaeyama group sedimentary formations which

by the pleistocene ryukyu group which is subdivided into the donan formation and ryukyu limestone formation fig 1c the donan formation is sedimentary and 30 m thick comprised mainly of fine grained quartz sands from the yaeyama group interspersed with small conglomerates of sandstone ryukyu limestone formation is the main formation of this group and has a thickness of 100 m it shows marked differences in stratum thickness and lithology among regions which has been interpreted as evidence that the sedimentary environment was drastically altered by intermittent faulting during the uplift of the yaeyama group sakai et al 1978 zaha 2009 sakai et al 1978 yazaki 1982 the urabu sand and gravel formation is characterized by pebbly gravel from the yaeyama group and brown clay is its main component the thickness of this layer has not yet been reported the uplift limestone is a terrace along the coast of the island at an elevation of 1 10 m the layer thickness is 10 m and the radiocarbon age of the coral is 39 300 2900 ybp suggesting that it formed during the late pleistocene sakai et al 1978 zaha 2009 sakai et al 1978 yazaki 1982 other sediments are holocene in age and are coastal deposits such as beach rock and dune sand layers fig 1c sakai et al 1978 zaha 2009 sakai et al 1978 yazaki 1982 a normal fault with a maximum vertical displacement of more than 160 m extends in a northeast southwest to northwest southeast direction cutting through the yaeyama and ryukyu groups red lines in fig 1c sakai et al 1978 zaha 2009 sakai et al 1978 yazaki 1982 in yonaguni island large scale drilling and electric exploration were carried out in the 1970 s for the purpose of securing a water source from groundwater and studying its potential and the groundwater level and depth of the basement rock were clarified fig 1d and e kurokawa et al 1979 moreover the results of pumping tests using drilled wells indicate that groundwater is zoned into the highly permeable ryukyu group with the yaeyama group as the basal impermeable layer kurokawa et al 1979 furthermore those aquifers are divided into five major groundwater basins by basement rock undulations and faults barumi taburu north coast kubura and higawa fig 1d the five groups are hydrologically subdivided into twelve basins minami ndan barumi kumma kumbaru taburu mutaburu tatagan tobaru kubura tarumai and higawa fig 1d kurokawa et al 1979 the sanninudai springs the target of this study are located at the boundary between the barumi a 2 in fig 1d and minami ndan a 1 in fig 1d sub basins within the barumi basin fig 1d kurokawa et al 1979 recognized the springs as eastern outlets of barumi basin groundwater kurokawa et al 1979 the barumi basin extends 1 km north south and 1 km east west beneath the northwestern side of sanninudai and is bordered on the west by the minami ndan groundwater basin fig 1d the groundwater level in the barumi basin is only 0 5 m above sea level in the east and rises gradually to 5 m in the west fig 1d kurokawa et al 1979 the deepest elevation of the basin is 60 m fig 1e and tidal fluctuation of groundwater level has been observed more than 300 m inland from the coastline kurokawa et al 1979 the minami ndan groundwater basin is located upstream of the barumi basin and its groundwater level ranges from 10 to 30 m fig 1d with a basement elevation from 30 40 m kurokawa et al 1979 the possibility of a groundwater waterfall under the ground has been suggested as the water level contour line is dense near the boundary between the minami ndan groundwater basin and the barumi groundwater basin kurokawa et al 1979 3 sampling 3 1 sampling sites at sanninudai located on the southeast coast of yonaguni island the ryukyu group and yaeyama group come into contact with a normal fault fig 1c springs arise from the bottom of the ryukyu group sediments and moisten the talus sediments below the ryukyu group photo 1 on these moistened sediments vegetation grows thickly photo 1a the ryukyu group is inclined to the east northeast and the springs are designated ysc ysb yse ysa and ysd ordered by distance from the fault zone photo 1a and table 1 ysa and ysd flow from the basement gravel layer of the ryukyu group donan formation and they flow noisily unlike other springs ysc ysb and yse accoding to kurokawa et al 1979 they are called the largest spring in yonaguni island mident and clearly have a higher flow rate 1000 l min kurokawa et al 1979 than the other springs photo 1b and d ysc ysb and yse are fairly low flow springs where the seeps can barely be found by following them through the wet grassland and the outlets are located in fault gouge covered with vegetation photo 1c ysc however dries up in october due to low rainfall on the island during the summer season and we were unable to sample ysc in october table 1 we also collected surface water from a river in the mountains to obtain representative samples of the meteoric water that falls on yonaguni island site ya table 1 and fig 1c the sampling site is named angai miduchi and is located to the south of mt urabu the highest mountain on yonaguni island this area is considered one of the sites where rainwater collects after falling on mt urabu downstream of the sampling site along the river a limestone formation is present on the bank of the river fig 1c flow becomes abundant and tufa can be found on the walls around the sampling site we observed the urabu sand and gravel formation fig 1c 3 2 water sampling water was sampled from the springs and river on three occasions 25 april 18 june and 27 october 2019 table 1 we measured the water temperature and ph and then collected unfiltered sf6 samples from ysa and ya in 300 ml brown bottles water was collected from all sites using plastic syringes fitted with disc filters 0 45 µm mesh and filtered into polyethylene bottles samples for anion concentration analysis were stored in a refrigerator until analysis in the laboratory samples for cation analysis were fixed with 1 wt 3 m nitric acid after returning to the laboratory all samples were promptly stored in a refrigerator until analysis 4 analytical methods the ammonium nh4 concentration was determined through phenol blue colorimetric analysis after returning to the laboratory the analytical precision of this method is within 1 the standard solution was prepared by using ammonium chloride nh4cl to prepare the concentration of the solution the alkalinity was then measured in the laboratory through titration with 0 1 m hydrochloric acid of

analytical precision is within 3 the anion and cation concentrations were determined using standard seawater sf6 was extracted using the purge and trap method and measured with a gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector kashiwaya et al 2017 at shinshu university the concentration was determined by measuring 1 5 ml of a standard gas containing 5 15 ppt of sf6 in a metering tube introducing it into the gas chromatograph and preparing a calibration curve the analytical precision is within 3 hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios of water samples were analyzed using laser absorption spectroscopy liquid water isotope analyzer lwia 24 ep los gatos research inc at the kochi institute for core sample research smow and slap standards were used to determine the isotope

δ18oh 2 o values are presented here relative to vienna standard mean ocean water the analytical precision is within 0 4 and 0 05 for δ2hh 2 o and δ18oh 2 o respectively 5 results and discussion 5 1 chemical and isotopic compositions of spring and river waters on yonaguni island the results of our analysis are presented in table 2 the relationships between concentrations of various chemical components relative to cl are shown in fig 2 where the red points indicate data from this study previously collected data for spring waters around sanninudai ys1995 blue circles and angai miduchi ya1995 blue reported by agata 1995 are also shown in fig 2 also indicated in fig 2 are spring water data reported by kurokawa et al 1979 around sanninudai ys1979 black circles groundwater basin data

groundwater basin minami ndan1979 black crosses in white squares the light blue dashed line in fig 2 indicates a possible mixing line between surface seawater turekian 1968 and water free from any dissolved components representing hypothesized precipitation dilution line as the chemical composition of terrestrial water has seasonal and local variations points for chemical compositions that do not fall on the line can be explained through various processes other than simple dilution of seawater with local meteoric water the endmember compositions of δ2hh 2 o and δ18oh 2 o fig 2m n and o were assumed to be the average values of groundwater on yonaguni island as reported in the previous literature agata and satake 1997 agata et al 2011 agata 2015 a possible mixing line between seawater and the average groundwater of yonaguni island is shown as a dark blue dashed line in fig 2m n and o mixing line in addition the approximate line drawn from seawater to the data of this study is shown by the black dashed line and its y intercept is shown by the red star fig 2m and n fig 2o shows the relationship between δ2hh2o and δ18oh2o the black solid line is the local meteoric water line lmwl on yonaguni island agata and satake 1997 agata et al 2011 agata 2015 where the y intercept d excess value is reported to be 20 5 in winter and 10 in summer the line connecting the edge components of the spring water red star and seawater determined in fig 2m and 2 n is shown as a black dashed line fig 2o the relationship between na and cl concentrations indicates that the spring waters sampled are contaminated with seawater fig 2a as noted in previous studies agata 1995 kurokawa et al 1979 on the other hand the concentrations of k and lithium li which are alkali metals like na are plotted below the dilution line in the spring waters suggesting that they were removed from the water via processes such as cation exchange reactions on clay minerals fig 2b and c however it has been suggested that k and li are supplied to some river waters and groundwater basins indicating decomposition and leaching from solid phases such as clay minerals in the surrounding strata in the case of k the effect of agricultural fertilizers used in the area should also be considered fig 2b for all terrestrial water the points fell in a region of higher ca concentration than the dilution line of seawater as reported in previous studies agata 1995 kurokawa et al 1979 which may be due to dissolution of the ryukyu limestone fig 2d in terms of other bivalent cations magnesium mg is slightly depleted in spring water relative to diluted seawater fig 2e but this this difference appears to be mostly within the range of analytical error on the other hand strontium sr is enriched in all terrestrial waters relative to diluted seawater fig 2f which also seems to be the effect of the dissolution of the ryukyu limestone as shown in ca thus the components that cannot be explained by dilution of seawater alone are considered to have a surrounding solid phase as a source fig 2d e and f points of our results for cl and so4 2 the second most abundant anion in seawater were plotted along the mixing line with seawater fig 2g suggesting that the environment of the flow path was not in so reductive condition that sulfate reduction occurs fig 2g no3 was not considerably reduced in any terrestrial waters and was enriched compared with seawater likely due to fertilizer usage fig 2h land uses in the watershed of the barumi groundwater basin group which extends west northwest from sanninudai is 30 cultivated fields 30 broad leaved forests and 30 wild grasslands okinawa prefecture hp 2020 chemical fertilizers and compost used in agriculture may impact terrestrial water chemistry the world health organization and japanese environmental standard value is 10 mg l as no3 n 700 µm as no3 organization 2017 although the values obtained here are lower than the standard fig 2h it is essential to continue monitoring their changes alkalinity can be considered the concentration of hco3 as the ph values of all waters sampled in this study were nearly neutral table 2 the alkalinity of all waters was plotted above the mixing line with seawater fig 2i as suggested in previous studies agata 1995 kurokawa et al 1979 hco3 is supplied along with ca fig 2d from the dissolution of calcium carbonate caco3 derived from the ryukyu limestone in the ryukyu group which is widely distributed on the island fig 1c si concentrations for all terrestrial waters were higher than the dilution line of seawater fig 2j this result suggests that all terrestrial water is supplied with si although the solubility of si the main component of the rock is relatively low si leaching from rocks can affect si concentrations fig 2j boron b concentrations were plotted in a region slightly lower than the dilution line of seawater suggesting that b is affected by a reaction process that removes it before the water emerges similar to k and li fig 2k on the other hand iron fe is plotted higher than the dilution line suggesting that this relatively common constituent of rocks is supplied from the surrounding rocks and clays in the same manner as si fig 2l the silicate rocks in yonaguni island are considered to be the yaeyama group the urabu sand and gravel formation or the donan formation distributed near the discharge of the springs water isotope ratios δ2hh2o and δ18oh2o values are displaced below the mixing line between seawater and the average groundwater of yonaguni island fig 2m and n here we use the average groundwater values of 19 5 3 6 for δ2hh2o and 4 5 0 4 for δ18oh2o for yonaguni island agata and satake 1997 agata et al 2011 agata 2015 water isotope ratios generally do not change due to chemical reactions at low temperatures but only through mixing with fluids that have different isotope ratios this pattern suggests that both the hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios observed here may be affected by mixing with fluids with low isotope ratios relative to the average groundwater in yonaguni island fig 2m and n assuming the existence of such a source of fresh water the approximate lines of the data are shown as red dashed lines with a mixing line through the seawater to obtain the value of the cl 0 intercept fig 2m and n the cl 0 intercept shows values of δ2hh2o 26 3 0 2 and δ18oh2o 5 34 0 02 respectively fig 2 m and 2 n the spring water can be explained by a mixture of about 5 seawater and fresh water with these edge components fig 2 m 2 n and 2o almost all the data for these springs lie on a straight line with similar y intercepts and none of the data are remarkably close to the summer lmwl or winter lmwl fig 2o this indicates that the springs are not affected by significant seasonal variations suggesting that the groundwater residence time may be longer than approximately 5 years małoszewski et al 1983 in addition the water with lower values of any isotope ratio than the average groundwater value can be explained at least in part by the effect of the altitude of the water source for example a value of 0 25 100 m for δ18oh2o has been reported for central japan waseda and nakai 1983 and values of 0 4 to 0 2 100 m for δ18oh2o at mid latitudes are generally known to be lower than those at lower latitudes siegenthaler 1979 the closest reported values to yonaguni island are 0 17 100 m yamanaka et al 2009 and 0 1 100 m agata et al 2011 on yakushima island here the δ18oh2o of the edge component of the spring water at sunninudai obtained by this study is 5 34 which is about 0 84 lower than the average value 4 5 of groundwater in yonaguni island assuming an altitude effect of 0 4 to 0 1 100 m the origin of the fresh water is estimated to be from an altitude of 210 840 m however the highest peak on yonaguni island is mt urabu 231 m fig 1d which rises just north of sunninudai suggesting that the fresh water is coming from such an altitude thus it is suggested that the spring water at the sanninudai is a mixture of fresh water from the altitude and about 5 seawater 5 2 quantitative estimation of the seawater contribution to seeping fluids the spring waters at sanninudai are formed through mixing of two end members seawater and the fresh water from mt urabu as discussed in the former section among these end members the second is a freshwater source and therefore the seawater influence can be calculated from the concentrations of salt components cl and na show a strong correlation fig 2a other components show impacts from end members other than seawater and freshwater fig 2 but cl and na are affected by only these two end members cl and na are very highly soluble and are present in seawater at very high levels na accounts for about 30 of the solutes in seawater and is the second most dissolved chemical species in seawater after cl cl is the most dissolved chemical species in seawater and accounts for about 55 of the solutes in seawater turekian 1968 therefore even if they are diluted their concentration remains sufficiently high for measurement in addition as these elements are not used in the major metabolic processes of microorganisms they are negligibly affected by removal processes or factors other than mixing with meteoric water thus the extent to which seawater affects spring water can be quantitatively estimated from the concentration of cl or na in the spring water in a strict sense however na can form precipitation when mixing of different water with different chemistry occurs for example when limestone water is mixed with seawater an oversaturation can occur and nahco3 could precipitate this might be the reason why the plots for the spring waters are slightly below the dilution line of seawater fig 2a therefore we shall use the concentration of cl to determine the mixing ratio of seawater as shown in the following equation eq 1 1 rsw clobs clsw 100 where rsw is the percentage of seawater in spring water and clobs and clsw are the cl concentrations in spring water mmol l and seawater mmol l respectively the concentration of cl in seawater clsw was determined using the concentration of cl in international association for the physical sciences of the ocean standard seawater 545 mmol l which was also used to determine the concentration of cl in samples gieskes et al 1991 gamo and gieskes 1992 the resulting estimates are summarized in table 3 among the five springs sampled in this study only ysd had a low seawater percentage of 3 while the other springs were around 5 seawater table 3 for reference we calculated concentrations in the same manner using previously collected data and listed the results in table 3 those results show that values vary from year to year with seawater contents of 1 5 in 1995 and 2 3 in 1979 the exact location where these samples were collected is unclear and therefore we cannot directly compare our results with previous measurements but seawater percentage appears to be increasing over time this process may not be a gradual progression and insufficient data are available to investigate variations over time so further data are needed to assess temporal changes however the effect of seawater on the spring water around sanninudai is clearly stronger than in the past therefore close monitoring is necessary to determine the relationship of this shift with the concurrent rise in sea level due to global warming notably the magnitude of seawater mixing in the spring water sampled in this study is ordered ysc ysb yse ysa ysd table 3 this pattern is consistent with the geographic positions of the springs ordered from south ysc to north ysd photo 1a this geographic distribution suggests that the freshwater source is located in the north and the influence of seawater is stronger to the south 5 3 estimation of the mean residence time of spring water using sf6 concentration next residence time of the groundwater is estimated using the sf6 concentration in the groundwater the groundwater is assumed to be piston flow without mixing with the old groundwater also it is not the actual residence time but only the residence time indicated by the tracer the best way to estimate the residence time of groundwater is to use the lumped parameter model małoszewski and zuber 1982 especially when considering groundwater with an expected residence time that is less than 5 years however the concentration constant model requires several years of observation data of tracer concentration which cannot be applied in this study however since we can only obtain the residence time as a weighted average of sf6 in the sample volume at least we will refer to it as the mean residence time chambers et al 2019 suckow 2014 sf6 concentrations in groundwater under the assumption of atmospheric equilibrium with past atmospheric sf6 concentrations were calculated from sf6 in the atmosphere usgs 2022 the recharge altitude set to 231 m above sea level at mt urabu and the recharge temperature set to the mean temperature of 24 0 c at yonaguni island japan meteorological agency 2021 and the results are shown in fig 3 wanninkhof et al 1991 busenberg and plummer 2000 darling et al 2012 as shown in fig 3 the sf6 concentrations in groundwater in equilibrium with sf6 in the atmosphere have increased gradually from 1975 0 1 fmol l to the present 2 4 fmol l the sf6 concentrations average value 2 2 fmol l in the sampled spring water were 2 22 2 20 and 2 18 fmol l for samples collected in april june and october respectively table 2 the sf6 concentration in the original groundwater should be corrected based on mixing of 5 seawater at atmospheric equilibrium as seawater was mixed into the groundwater at approximately that level as described above table 3 the corrected values are consistent with 2 2 fmol l within the error range of our measurement method converting this value to the age of the groundwater at atmospheric equilibrium we obtained a result of 2016 dotted line in fig 3 which is could be older due to groundwater fluctuations caused by the typhoon the effect of excess air ea must also be taken into account which is an unavoidable error caused by the dissolution of air bubbles during recharge heaton and vogel 1981 due to this ea effect sf6 concentrations can be observed to be three to five times higher gooddy et al 2006 darling et al 2012 taking this into account assuming that the maximum five fold effect was observed the observed concentration in this study could be corrected to 0 44 fmol l which may have been in equilibrium with the atmosphere around 1986 dashed line in fig 3 furthermore as shown in the previous section no seasonal variation was observed suggesting that the residence time is likely to be more than 5 years these results indicate that the mean residence time of the spring water is more than 5 years the mean residence time of more than 5 years fits relatively well with values measured along the coast of the island 2 14 years yoshimoto et al 2016 where a similar setting of ryukyu limestone and impermeable base occurs and thus is likely a reasonable value 5 4 degree of caco3 saturation in spring water the relationships of ca concentration to hco3 concentration in terrestrial waters including spring river and groundwater are shown in fig 4a as described above the concentration of hco3 is used as an approximation of alkalinity as the ph of the spring water is near 7 table 2 most terrestrial water data were plotted around the 1 2 line of ca versus hco3 concentration blue dashed line in fig 4a this relationship may be due to an increase in the concentration of ca and hco3 associated with dissolution by groundwater of ryukyu limestone in the ryukyu group which is widely distributed on yonaguni island eq 2 2 caco3 co2 h2o ca2 2hco3 in the soil decomposition of organic matter occurs according to eq 3 forming carbon dioxide fang 2010 3 ch2o n no2 nco2 nh2o rainwater that has reached equilibrium with atmospheric carbon dioxide during its descent into the atmosphere falls on the ground and carbon dioxide generated in the soil eq 3 is dissolved in the rainwater during infiltration through the ground to become groundwater which leads to dissolution of caco3 as described by eq 2 on the other hand outside of these linear relationships most springs red points in fig 4a and some groundwater samples were plotted in areas indicating a high proportion of ca conversely a few points have ca versus hco3 concentrations lower than 1 2 fig 4a these results suggest that a source with a ratio of ca to hco3 concentration higher than 1 2 affects spring water in the sampling area fig 4a the most likely candidate for such a source is seawater or sea salt aerosol particles as suggested in fig 2 the concentrations of ca and hco3 in seawater were 10 mmol l and 2 4 mmol l respectively and the dilution line of seawater in fig 4a is shown as a light blue dashed line as indicated by the dilution line the ratio of ca to hco3 concentration in seawater is greater than 1 2 with an excess of ca this finding suggests that seawater may drive the data from springs with high ca ratios away from the 1 2 line of ca to hco3 concentration to determine whether dissolution equilibrium was reached for caco3 the saturation index si for each sample was calculated using the geochemist s workbench gwb 14 hulinks parkhurst and appelo 1999 the calculation was conducted using observed temperature and ph values table 2 and the activity coefficient and equilibrium constants were obtained from the gwb database si values were calculated using the equilibrium constant for the dissolution equilibrium of caco3 k 5 k ca2 hco3 h mmol l and 6 q ca2 obs hco3 obs h obs mmol l for the observed value q then the logarithm of the ratio of q k was calculated as the si value stumm and morgan 1996 7 si log q k the obtained si values are summarized in table 2 if the si value is negative the sample is unsaturated with respect to caco3 on the other hand positive values indicate supersaturated samples in fig 4b the hco3 concentration is used as the abscissa and the calculated saturation si is plotted as the ordinate at si 0 indicating saturation a dashed line is shown fig 4b this graph shows that some groundwater samples containing ya are below the saturation line indicating that those samples are unsaturated for caco3 while all spring waters are supersaturated for caco3 fig 4b in particular groundwater in the barumi and minami ndan groundwater basins was supersaturated similar to water sampled at springs fig 4b only six points around ya1995 meet the saturation condition fig 4b these data correspond to hco3 concentrations around 3 mm fig 4 above which supersaturation tends to occur fig 4 conversely hco3 concentrations lower than 2 5 mm tended to be unsaturated fig 4 this result indicates that points with hco3 concentrations above a threshold of 3 mm are oversaturated and lower than 2 5 mm are unsaturated fig 4a even if the data fall along a dissolution line representing ca and hco3 at a ratio of 1 2 the ca levels in springs such as ysa ysb ysc ysd and yse obtained in this study hereafter ys2019 are above the dissolution line in fig 4a and also appear supersaturated in fig 4b thus caco3 is likely in a supersaturated state due to excess ca input from seawater on the other hand groundwater data for the barumi basin and minami ndan basin indicate supersaturation of caco3 as shown in fig 4b although the points are along the dissolution line of caco3 shown in fig 4a this result indicates that groundwater in the barumi groundwater basin and the minami ndan groundwater basin is supersaturated with caco3 due to the influence of seawater and is also controlled by the dissolution of caco3 as its concentrations fall along the dissolution line of caco3 fig 4 this finding suggests that the groundwater in these basins receives abnormally high ca concentrations from seawater and that the dissolution of caco3 is progressing toward equilibrium indicating a buffering effect ys2019 samples do not reflect this buffering effect indicating that they may discharge before the buffering effect occurs and thus suggesting that seawater components may have been mixed with the groundwater just before discharge for example it is possible that the influence of sea salt particles is limited to surface soils around the discharge outlets and that the sea salt is added immediately before discharge on the other hand although the groundwater of the barumi and minami ndan basins is exposed to seawater it also contains dissolved caco3 the main component of ryukyu limestone in the surrounding ryukyu group which shows a buffering effect thus based on the degree of saturation of caco3 in the groundwater and spring waters we can explore differences in mixing and dissolution process between groundwater and spring waters prior to their discharge 5 5 discharge mechanism of springs in sanninudai on the southeast coast of yonaguni island fig 5 shows a schematic diagram of groundwater flow in sanninudai on the southeastern coast of yonaguni island considering the chemical composition of spring water and groundwater figs 2 4 the basement formation fig 1e the yaeyama group which is the base of the impermeable layer and the ryukyu limestone which is the aquifer and the elevation of the groundwater table fig 1d the groundwater basin known as the barumi basin is located on the north side of the spring area at an elevation of 60 m fig 1e kurokawa et al 1979 the groundwater level around the spring area has fallen almost to sea level at 0 5 m fig 1d kurokawa et al 1979 on the other hand the elevation of the surrounding area is 50 m according to the land use map okinawa prefecture hp 2020 corresponding to the height of the outcrop shown in photo 1 based on these levels a cross sectional diagram of the groundwater basin north of the spring area was constructed and is presented in fig 5a due to the high permeability of the ryukyu limestone within the ryukyu group kurokawa et al 1979 water rarely stays as groundwater for a long time but flows until it reaches the groundwater basin fig 5a in addition as tidal fluctuations extend more than 300 m inland kurokawa et al 1979 seawater intrusion into the barumi basin is likely the ratio of the ca to hco3 concentration is 1 2 fig 4 suggesting that caco3 is approaching equilibrium through the dissolution of caco3 rather than invasion of seawater as illustrated in fig 4 these results are visualized in fig 5a the structure of the groundwater around the spring area is shown in fig 5b the groundwater is supplied as rainwater at mt urabu and takes at least five years to reach the area around the spring area in the vicinity of the spring area the elevation remains almost unchanged at 50 m but the base height rises to 40 m fig 1e kurokawa et al 1979 thus the groundwater level is 10 m fig 1d kurokawa et al 1979 based on our finding that the spring sites were in the range of 10 15 m table 1 we inferred the subsurface structure and water flow pattern as shown in fig 5b the equilibrium state of the spring water for caco3 showed that ys2019 waters were supersaturated with caco3 suggesting that the surface soil around the discharge point of the springs was affected by seawater which entered the water just before discharge fig 5b spring water seeps out from the donan gravel layer which is the basal portion of the ryukyu group the donan gravel occurs in three layers photo 1a ysd is located at the highest layer ysa is at the second layer and ysb ysc and yse are at the third gravel layer buried in talus sediments photo 1a in addition the flow rates of ysa and ysd appeared to decrease during the summer season and flow stopped at ysc suggesting that ysc is the terminal outlet farthest from the spring water source as the chemical effect of seawater is highest in ysc and lower in spring water collected in the north ysc ysb yse ysa ysd table 3 we propose that groundwater is supplied to the second gravel layer containing ysa spring water through the uppermost gravel layer containing ysd before reaching ysc which is located in the southernmost area shown in photo 1 fig 5b the yaeyama group slopes downward to the north kurokawa et al 1979 reaching an elevation of 60 m as shown in fig 5a thus although the spring is considered an outlet of the barumi groundwater basin kurokawa et al 1979 it would be more accurate to describe it as an outlet of the minami ndan groundwater basin such accurate determination of groundwater flow paths is essential to the conservation and management of groundwater sources and their sustainable use other areas around the world may show similar complexity requiring a review of past findings this possibility indicates the need for re examination of groundwater sources around the world in particular the development of novel analytical methods for chemical components may provide valuable information the chemical composition of spring water on remote islands where anthropogenic activities have little influence should be investigated continuously to monitor the effects of sea level rise caused by global warming 6 conclusions spring water was collected from sanninudai on the southeastern coast of yonaguni island in the southern ryukyu forearc and various chemical and isotopic constituents were investigated to infer the groundwater flow pathways the spring water contained 3 5 seawater components suggesting influences from sea salt particles or seawater the isotopic composition of the spring water indicates a fresh water supply from a higher elevation suggesting that it was supplied by precipitation on mt urabu which is located immediately to the north of the spring water the estimated date at which the rainwater was in atmospheric equilibrium based on sf6 concentrations was around 1986 2016 indicating that water is retained for at least three years after becoming groundwater and losing contact with the atmosphere the lack of seasonal variation in the isotope ratios of the water suggests that the water may have been retained for more than five years all sampled springs were supersaturated with caco3 although excess ca could be supplied from seawater to the springs equilibrium would be reached eventually however the springs were not in equilibrium this result suggests that the effect of seawater may be limited to the surface soil around the discharge outlets and that equilibrium with ca newly supplied before discharge had not been reached based on these findings we constructed a conceptual diagram of groundwater flow in the vicinity of the spring area the spring group at sanninudai has been considered an outlet on the east coast of the barumi groundwater basin kurokawa et al 1979 but is more appropriately considered an outlet on the east coast of the minami ndan groundwater basin considering its elevation the importance of accurately understanding the groundwater flow paths have been demonstrated by this study in the future we will conduct some borehole investigations and electrical surveys to update the data of groundwater level and depth of the foundation in addition the seasonal variation of discharge rate should be monitored and the influence of precipitation in the summer season should also be quantitatively clarified credit authorship contribution

8062,study region silver springs is a karst spring in north central florida as landuses in the springshed have urbanized in recent decades concentrations of contaminants including nitrate have increased in spring water causing environmental concerns study focus pathways of groundwater movement from stormwater management areas to silver springs were investigated using ground based geophysical surveys ground penetrating radar and frequency domain electromagnetics accompanied by tracer tests in the upper floridan aquifer ufa and surficial aquifer results indicated heterogeneous near surface and deep karst conditions where stormwater runoff may be transported quickly through groundwater to the spring a wide range of groundwater velocities 10 6 to 10 3 ms 1 were observed in the surficial aquifer where faster flow speeds were associated with subsurface anomalies and preferential flow however tracer injected into the ufa was observed in the spring hours later suggesting possible maximum groundwater velocities on the order of 10 1 ms 1 in the karst aquifer series of tracer pulses in the spring highlight the complexity of flow pathways to silver springs new hydrological insights for the region the rapid transport of tracer from stormwater basins to silver springs suggests that stormwater infiltration basins may be hotspots for potential aquifer and spring contamination in karst areas development of stormwater best management practices bmps that integrate heterogeneous karst transport processes may enhance spring and groundwater quality in silver

characterized by specific geologic and hydrogeologic conditions ford and williams 2013 ficco and sasowsky 2018 goldscheider et al 2020 within karst aquifers surface and underground openings e g sinkholes and conduits are formed by the dissolution of karstic rocks limestone and dolomite and groundwater flows within a heterogeneous system governed by the combination of matrix porosity fracture porosity and conduit porosity shuster and white 1971 white 1988 bakalowicz 2005 hartmann et al 2014 yang et al 2019 the rock dissolution and flow heterogeneity can render groundwater susceptible to surface contamination particularly where karst features are exposed at the surface or where surface soils are thin and the groundwater table is shallow stephenson et al 1999 katz 2001 zhou and beck 2008 shokri et al 2016 katz 2019 for example since the 1960 s nitrogen concentrations have steadily increased in silver springs a first magnitude karst spring in north central florida discharging water from the floridan aquifer system fdep 2006 2012 hicks and holland 2012 the increase in nitrogen concentration has been attributed to increases in urban residential and agricultural land uses in

surface to and within karst aquifers may be rapid worthington and ford 2009 husic et al 2020a 2020b for example average groundwater velocity in dinaric karst was measured in the range of 1 7 47 500 m d milanovic 1981 kačaroğlu 1999 and as 5280 m d in a travertine karst aquifer in antalya turkey günay and ekmekçi 1997 by contrast groundwater velocity is typically less than 1 m d in alluvial aquifers matthess and pekdeger 1985 essouayed et al 2019 high groundwater velocities in karst systems may influence subsurface biogeochemical processes by limiting opportunity for biogeochemical transformation and nutrient uptake producing high nutrient concentrations at discharge points puckett and cowdery 2002 dubrovsky et al 2010 conservative tracers can provide information about hydraulic connections between injection and monitoring points allowing for estimation of aquifer characteristics and residence time corbett et al 2000 flury and wai 2003 lauber et al 2014 worthington and soley 2017 analysis of breakthrough tracer curves can also provide knowledge about potential dispersivity of contaminants in an aquifer geyer et al 2007 massei et al 2006 morales et al 2007 goldscheider 2008 further ground based geophysical techniques including ground penetrating radar gpr and electromagnetic em response can detect subsurface preferential flow paths in karst regions militzer et al

aquifers requires a basinwide approach stormwater infiltration areas may be locations of particular vulnerability as diffuse pollutants are concentrated to these locations during runoff events weiss et al 2008 moore and beck 2018 the typically thin surface soils found in epikarst of well developed karst areas may allow contaminated surface water such as urban stormwater runoff to discharge into groundwater through open sinkholes or infiltrate relatively quickly through subsurface karst features and fractures potentially limiting the effectiveness of stormwater management basins in attenuating contaminants byle 2001 behroozi 2019 for example stormwater management basins are typical stormwater best management practices bmps applied in karst areas of florida and must be permitted as meeting specific design and performance standards to guarantee water quality and quantity requirements of the stormwater management system e g harper and baker 2007 erp 2013 however even though geometric designs minimum infiltration rates and vadose zone capacities are specified e g retention basins should infiltrate runoff within 24 72 h of event should have minimum unsaturated subsurface storage 0 3 1 m above the seasonal groundwater table and side slopes should not be steeper than 3 1 the presence of subsurface anomalies and sinkholes may increase expected infiltration rates and negatively influence treatment performance a better understanding of how stormwater management basins function within karst areas can help establish better strategies for stormwater management groundwater protection and water quality restoration to address these research gaps and provide guidance for stormwater runoff management the objective of this research is to characterize subsurface conditions in stormwater management basins within the silver springs springshed and to observe travel times of shallow and deep groundwater flow from stormwater management basins to surface discharge in silver springs this study is one of the first to directly investigate how stormwater may be transported to and within karst aquifers which is important information for water resources managers aiming to protect or remediate water quality in karst regions 2 methodology 2 1 study area the silver springs springshed approximately 2362 km2 discharges groundwater to silver springs one of the largest karst springs in florida knowles et al 2010 german 2010 fig 1 a silver springs is located 10 km east of the city of ocala and forms the headwaters of the silver river where flow gauged at the silver river monitoring station usgs 02239501 represents combined discharge from multiple spring vents the climate of north central florida is humid subtropical with warm rainy summers june to september and mild dry winters with mean annual precipitation and temperature of about 1520 mm and 22 c respectively noaa 2017 the mean annual groundwater discharge 1933 2007 from silver springs is about 22 7 m3 s mainly supplied by the upper floridan aquifer ufa which is a sequence of thick 300 460 m eogenetic karst phelps 2004 phelps et al 2006 knowles et al 2010 the majority of groundwater flow in the ufa about 86 occurs in the top 30 m of the aquifer which is a granular limestone and the dolomite formation of ocala limestone upper eocene faulkner 1970 knowles et al 2010 the ufa is separated from a perched surficial aquifer pliocene to holocene by a semi confining unit of interbedded quartz sand silt and clay of the hawthorn group miocene knowles et al 2002 phelps 2004 the surficial aquifer consists of sand silty sand to clay sediments of varied thickness and may be locally absent where carbonate rocks are exposed phelps 2004 knowles 1996 geomorphologically the silver springs springshed has a low gradient 55 m of relief and the lowest elevation corresponds to the location of main silver springs vents forming a local base level for groundwater the dissolution of karst rocks has resulted in numerous shallow sinkholes depressions and fractures distributed around silver springs faulkner 1970 phelps 2004 three study areas basins 1 3 within the silver springs springshed were chosen forming a transect across the springshed in the direction of expected prevalent groundwater flow west to east fig 1 and table 1 the study areas are all dry stormwater management basins where stormwater runoff from surrounding roadways drains into the basins and infiltrates to recharge the groundwater system through basin soils basin 1 29º12 55 n and 82º03 30 w is owned and managed by florida department of transportation and basins 2 29º12 06 n and 82º05 01 w and 3 29º11 57 n and 82º05 53 w are managed by the city of ocala bore hole data obtained in the basins indicated the existence of a surficial aquifer consisting of unconsolidated sand and silty sandy soil from the surface to about 3 m depth a consolidated semi confining unit of quartz sand silt and clay of from 3 to 6 m depth and limestone below 6 m kibler et al 2020 several sinkholes had been reported in basins 2 eleven and 3 fourteen florida department of transportation 2019 fig 1 b the presence of these known sinkholes indicates that these basins may be potential hotspots for groundwater contamination basin 1 was chosen for study due to its proximity to the main vents of silver springs during initial field surveys three sinkholes were observed in basin 2 including a large open sinkhole and two sinkholes were observed in basin 3 including a large collapsed sinkhole and a deep small soil pipe fig 2 2 2 experimental procedure 2 2 1 geophysical surveys the subsurface of study areas was characterized to a maximum depth of 15 m below surface using two geophysical methods gpr and em gpr was performed using a gssi sir 3000 with a 270 mega hertz mhz antenna using 512 samples per scan the gpr was used to detect subsurface geological features anomalies to depths of 6 6 7 m that could be related to development of buried karst features gpr data were collected on 3 m grids across each site using a time range setting of 110 nano seconds ns for basin 1 and 150 ns for basins 2 and 3 em data were collected over 6 m transects using a geonics em34 3 with a 10 m coil separation the em responses were used to understand the spatial variation of subsurface conductivity across the basins where areas of low signal conductivity typically represent higher hydraulic conductivities chalikakis et al 2011 the em data were collected using both a vertical coplanar horizontal dipole and horizontal coplanar vertical dipole coil configurations providing an effective exploration range of 7 5 m and 15 m respectively mcneill 1980 based on results from the gpr survey and severe anomalies a transect of monitoring wells was established across 5 km of the springshed establishing one well in each basin 1 3 the 10 cm diameter wells were installed to depths that allowed tracer injection directly into the ufa 6 0 m in basin 1 and 7 6 m in basins 2 and 3 figs 1 and 3 in addition to the monitoring wells installed in the ufa hereafter deep wells a network of 12 relatively shallow 3 0 m depth monitoring wells hereafter shallow wells was installed within the surficial aquifer of basin 1 figs 1 and 3 groundwater level was monitored continuously 15 min interval in the surficial aquifer of basin 1 in well 7 over the first tracer experiment using pressure sensors onset hobo u20 and u20l installed at the ground surface and at a depth of 3 m groundwater level was measured in the deep wells at the start of the second tracer test inflow runoff volumes from the roadway into basin 1 were determined from pressure transducers installed in stilling wells near runoff inlets wen et al 2020 groundwater discharge at silver springs was obtained from the usgs silver river monitoring station 2 2 2 tracer tests tracer experiments were undertaken under natural flow field conditions to evaluate groundwater flow in the surface aquifer in the vicinity of silver springs and in the ufa across a section of the silver springs basin to characterize shallow groundwater flows in the vicinity of silver springs approximately 7 0 kg of rhodamine wt rwt was injected on july 25 2017 into the surficial aquifer from well 0 in basin 1 fig 3 followed by 1420 l of water at a rate of 0 25 ls 1 rwt tracer was monitored within the shallow well network in basin 1 and at the silver river station located approximately 1 7 km from the injection point and 1 1 km from the main silver springs discharge vent fig 1 the tracer was assumed to travel from the injection point to the main silver springs vent mammoth spring and then flow in the silver river as open channel flow to the silver river station groundwater from the wells and spring water samples 200 ml were collected with hand pumps and portable pump samplers sigma 900max and tested in triplicate for mean tracer concentration over a period of 9 months following tracer injection water samples were collected at short intervals every 1 2 h immediately after tracer injection and gradually increased to once a day and once a week as time progressed from the time of injection when rwt was no longer detectable in silver springs nearly 2 years after first tracer injection a second tracer test was undertaken at the springshed scale three tracer dyes with distinctive emittance rwt eosine eos and fluorescein fl ozark underground lab inc were injected into the ufa through the deep monitoring wells fig 1 tracers 11 3 kg of rwt 13 6 kg of eos and 11 3 kg of fl were diluted with water 1 5 before simultaneous injection into deep wells in basins 1 basin 2 and basin 3 on may 22 2019 followed by flushing with 1130 l water fig 1 groundwater and spring water samples were collected regularly from deep wells in basins 1 and 2 and from the silver river monitoring station and tested for tracer concentration over a period of 9 months from tracer injection sampling started at 1 hr intervals at the time of tracer injection and increased to 3 5 10 and 24 hr intervals all tracer samples were kept in dark cool conditions 5 c and tracer concentration was measured in triplicate after filtration through a 0 2 µm nylon membrane concentrations of rwt and fl were measured using two absorbance channels of an aquaflour handheld fluorimeter while eos concentrations were measured using a rf 5000 spectrofluorophotometer farmer and blew 2010 aley and beeman 2015 aley 2019 all readings were converted to ppb equivalents using calibration curves created using standard solutions of known concentration for each tracer 2 2 3 analysis methods gpr data were processed using radan 7 software and adjustments were made to remove air ground contacts in order to provide an accurate estimation of the depth to gpr signal reflectors a dielectric constant of 6 was chosen for the analysis which is appropriate for semi saturated sandy sediments in florida gpr anomalies were identified based upon the localized increase in penetration depth and amplitude of the gpr signal at depth relative to the surrounding areas em transects were interpolated to contour maps of conductivity using kriging geospatial methods the gpr and em results were compared qualitatively to detect convergence in conductivity gradients and locations of subsurface anomalies which guided the placement of monitoring wells maximum and average pulse groundwater velocities were estimated based respectively on the first arrival time of tracer after injection knochenmus 1967 taylor and greene 2008 mcgurk et al 2012 or the time of peak tracer concentration knochenmus 1967 mcgurk et al 2012 yang et al 2019 groundwater velocity was estimated considering the straight line distance between injection and monitoring points l and the time t elapsed from tracer injection to the detection of tracer above background to estimate maximum velocity v max or the time of peak concentration to estimate average pulse velocity v hydraulic gradient was estimated considering the water table elevation difference and distance between monitoring wells and the local base flow level in silver springs main vent using the maximum observed groundwater velocity reynolds number r e was estimated eq 1 czachor 2011 where ρ m l 3 and μ m l 1 t 1 are the density and dynamic viscosity of water v max

the silver river station indicated a positive skewness which could possibly be a result of non equilibrium effects created by immobile fluid regions field and pinsky 2000 goldscheider 2008 to estimate dispersivity in such a case a two region non equilibrium transport model was fit to the rwt breakthrough curve eqs 2 and 3 2 β r c 1 t d vl 2 c 1 z c 1 z ω c 1 c 2 μ 1 c 1 3 1 β r c 2 t ω c 1 c 2 μ 2

solute concentrations in the flowing and stagnant regions respectively and μ 1 and μ 2 refer to dimensionless solute decay in equilibrium and non equilibrium regions respectively field and pinsky 2000

affecting solute transport and r is adjustable model parameter field and pinsky 2000 the mass transfer coefficient ω describes exchange between the two fluid regions ω 0 where high values mean intense mass transfer between two fluid regions eqs 2 and 3 were solved numerically using the qtracer2 program and the model was fitted following toride et al 1999 and epa 2002 for this estimation 297 data points were applied 3 results 3 1 geophysical surveys gpr data detected many subsurface anomalies at depths ranging from 0 5 to 6 7 m below the local surface in the basins table 1 respectively 53 and 64 near surface anomalies potential karst features were detected in basins 1 and 3 detailed locations can be obtained in supplementary kml file the gpr profiles suggest wide and relatively deep anomalies potentially due to sediment depression in surficial aquifer due to water percolation fig 4 the spatial distribution of detected anomalies in basin 3 correlated well with the locations of the reported and observed sinkholes figs 1 and 5 despite the presence of reported and observed sinkholes in basin 2 only one minor near surface anomaly was detected by gpr fig 5c and d and table 1 observed sinkholes and gpr anomalies were found within regions characterized by low em signal conductivity figs 1 and 5 which is associated with areas of low clay content greater hydraulic conductivity and subsurface groundwater drainage routes kovalevsky et al 2004 despite the higher sensitivity of the vertical dipole mode to geological anomalies nobes 1999 caminha maciel and figueiredo 2013 data taken from the horizontal dipole mode provided a better correlation with observed sinkhole locations fig 5 in basin 1 the em data were spurious potentially due to interference from surrounding utilities 3 2 solute transport in surficial aquifer after rwt was introduced into the surficial aquifer of basin 1 near silver springs the range of observed maximum horizontal groundwater flow speeds 10 3 to 10 6 m s table 2 estimated based on first instances of tracer detection in the wellfield suggests variable flowpaths and transport mechanisms of shallow groundwater in the spring vicinity tracer movement revealed four distinctive patterns of groundwater flow behavior that varied according to location relative to the tracer injection site fig 3 and table 2 the first flow pattern fp1 with the fastest travel time 9 2 438 7 m d r e from 0 04 to 1 9 was seen in wells 9 11 located northeast of the injection site along the predominant direction of the regional groundwater flow towards silver springs and within a region where severe subsurface anomalies were detected by gpr figs 3 4 5 and 6a tracer was detected almost immediately after injection less than one hour in wells 10 and 11 table 2 the second flow pattern fp2 was observed in wells 7 and 8 with velocity in range of 1 2 1 4 m d r e from 7 6 10 3 to 8 8 10 3 figs 3 and 6 b tracer was detected after 13 days in wells 7 and 8 following a heavy rainfall that discharged approximately 182 m3 of stormwater runoff to the basin r1 fig 6 infiltration of the stormwater runoff led to local increase in elevation of the groundwater table which may have accelerated transport of the tracer the third flow pattern fp3 was characterized by a lower groundwater velocity 0 3 0 8 m d r e from 2 1 10 3 to 5 2 10 3 observed in wells 1 3 which were located southeast of the injection site table 2 tracer was detected in wells 1 3 about 35 days after injection fig 6 c a rainfall event occurred 21 days after the injection discharging approximately 148 m3 stormwater runoff r2 to the basin that could have likely driven the tracer movement simultaneous tracer pulses associated within this runoff event are detected in wells 7 11 fig 6 a and b the fourth flow pattern fp4 with the lowest maximum groundwater velocity 0 2 0 4 m d r e from 1 2 10 3 to 2 5 10 3 was seen in wells 4 6 after about 107 128 days from the injection figs 3 6 d and table 2 the tropical hurricane irma r3 occurred on day 48 following tracer injection fig 6 this event discharged about 1907 m3 stormwater runoff to the basin and increased groundwater levels for weeks presumably opening up new subsurface flowpaths despite this tracer did not appear in wells 4 6 until 59 days after the storm fig 6 d rwt was first detected at the silver river monitoring station 3 5 h after injection into well 0 in basin 1 suggesting a maximum velocity of about 10 900 m d 0 13 m s between the surficial aquifer and the monitoring point in silver river fig 6 e table 2 the hydraulic gradient was estimated during this time as 4 7 10 3 the breakthrough curve in silver river indicated four distinct concentration pulses the first peaking at 53 1 ppb 42 days after tracer injection fig 6 e the second third and fourth peak concentrations ranged from 26 1 to 39 5 ppb and were observed respectively 115 177 and 246 days after injection based upon these tracer pulses pulse groundwater velocities between the surficial aquifer in basin 1 and silver springs are estimated in the range of 2 3 13 5 m d table 3 groundwater flow discharge in silver springs increased from 11 6 to 20 3 m3 s over the monitoring period with a relatively sharp increase after hurricane irma r3 which closely followed the first observed peak concentration fig 6 e the hydraulic gradient from the surficial aquifer to the spring increased from 3 9 10 3 to 4 2 10 3 following the hurricane it is likely that the elevated groundwater table and spring discharge that lasted weeks after the hurricane had an influence to the delivery of tracer following the first observed peak 3 3 solute transport in upper floridan aquifer the rwt injected into the ufa from basin 1 was detected above background at the silver river station about two hours indicating a maximum ufa groundwater velocity of 19 200 m d 0 22 m s in the vicinity of silver springs fig 7 a table 2 while the hydraulic gradient was estimated as about 4 7 10 3 reynolds number of the observed maximum groundwater velocities 71 and 121 calculated assuming flow through porous media eq 1 indicates turbulent flow condition it is therefore unlikely that this flow was sustained through a homogenous porous medium but instead was transported through conduit flow following the first detection tracer concentrations remained low for several days but began to increase steadily after about 8 days and reached a peak concentration of 4 6 ppb after about 70 days fig 7 a concentrations returned to near baseline by around 140 days and then increased again in a lower more diffuse peak about 245 days from the injection fig 7 a pulse groundwater velocities based on timing of these tracer peaks were about 2 3 7 9 m d table 3 the breakthrough curve indicated that most detected tracer traveled to the spring within about 100 days after the injection fig 7 a and that the bulk of this mass was captured from 8 to 100 days after injection a two region non equilibrium model fitted to the main breakthrough curve suggests that the dispersivity of the aquifer is about 1 8 m neither eos from basin 2 nor fl from basin 3 injected into the ufa were observed at the silver river monitoring station table 2 eos was never observed in any monitoring location the hydraulic gradient between basin 2 and silver springs and basin 3 and silver springs was estimated as 3 5 10 4 and 2 3 10 4 respectively however fl was detected in the ufa below basin 2 approximately 6 days after injection in basin 3 suggesting a maximum groundwater velocity between basins 3 and 2 of 233 m d fig 7 b table 2 under a hydraulic gradient of about 2 2 10 4 the observed fl concentration increased slowly after detection from 0 08 to 1 9 ppb by around 61 days then increased rapidly to 18 3 ppb by 86 days fig 7 b from 86 to around 200 days fl concentrations remained largely at a steady state varying between 18 3 and 22 7 ppb concentrations began to increase again after 214 days and continued to increase through the cessation of monitoring fig 7 b 4 discussion 4 1 groundwater flow velocities groundwater velocities observed in most areas of the surficial aquifer fp2 to fp4 are comparable to those reported for saturated sandy and silty sandy soil media 1 m d matthess and pekdeger 1985 fetter et al 1999 dingman 2002 velocities and reynolds numbers are consistent with low head darcian flow through the well sorted sands with few fine particle fractions reported for the surface soils in basin 1 chang et al 2015 rice 2018 observed velocities in fp2 fp4 wells are also within the range of horizontal groundwater velocities observed in other sandy surficial aquifers in non karst areas in florida 0 02 0 42 m d corbett et al 2000 however the near immediate detection of tracer in fp1 wells indicates that groundwater flows in some parts of the surficial aquifer may fall outside of the range expected by transport through homogeneous sandy media and may be related to the influence of macropores in subsurface strata etana et al 2013 fig 3 and table 2 for example the maximum groundwater velocities observed in fp1 wells based on the first arrival time of tracer demonstrates that macropores and subsurface features as detected by gpr may allow for advective transport of stormwater in the shallow subsurface in contrast the maximum groundwater velocities observed in fp4 wells wells 4 6 could correlate to matrix flow speeds with large contributions of dispersive or diffusive transport sudicky et al 1983 the maximum groundwater velocities observed in the ufa 233 19 200 m d indicate the presence of rapid groundwater flow paths especially from the ufa under basin 1 to the silver river monitoring station table 2 the comparison of maximum groundwater velocities observed in silver springs when the tracer was injected at a similar location basin 1 but at different depths into the ufa vs the surficial aquifer indicates that flow through the ufa in the immediate vicinity of silver springs was almost twice as fast as flow from the surficial aquifer table 2 and fig 6 while we cannot differentiate groundwater velocity from the transport time of open channel flow results suggest that groundwater velocity in the ufa from basin 1 to silver springs is fast potentially within large conduits under high hydraulic gradients as groundwater flows converge to the silver springs discharge vents to reach the spring tracer injected into the surficial aquifer had to move either through the surficial aquifer to the spring or pass through the intermediate confining layer to reach the ufa in addition the maximum groundwater velocities observed in the ufa are comparable to groundwater velocities reported in other karst areas for example the mcconnell springs 7600 m d norris et al 2016 and mystery spring 2680 m d martin et al 2019 in kentucky and the blautopf spring watershed in germany 1224 to 13 872 m d lauber et al 2014 the relatively high groundwater velocity observed in the ufa in this study may be partially associated to the eogenetic karst of the study area which is characterized by higher matrix porosity relative to the dense telogenetic karst with lower matrix porosity found in kentucky vacher and mylroie 2002 florea and vacher 2006 however the location of study in basin 1 in close proximity to the high magnitude spring vents may also have contributed to the high velocities observed in the spring vicinity for instance the lower maximum groundwater velocity observed in the ufa further from the spring vents 233 m d between basins 3 and 2 is comparable to maximum velocities previously reported in the ufa near silver springs 702 m d knochenmus 1967 despite considerable differences in the maximum groundwater velocities observed in the ufa and surficial aquifer groundwater velocities estimated based on the times of peak concentrations in the spring 2 3 and 13 5 m d respectively are similar in the two tracer inspections from basin 1 table 3 these are also similar to mean groundwater velocities reported in some earlier tracer studies of the ufa in the vicinity of silver springs 10 2 91 4 m d phelps 1994 although greater mean groundwater velocities have also been reported in ufa near silver springs e g 350 m d knochenmus 1967 213 427 m d mcgurk et al 2012 and 8 4 317 m d yang et al 2019 further mean groundwater velocities reported in this and other studies near silver springs are comparable to estimated mean groundwater velocities in other karst areas of florida e g 42 299 m d near wekiva spring fdep 2016 and 31 298 m d in wakulla spring kincaid et al 2012 tracer concentrations observed in silver springs were low for instance relative to concentrations observed in the monitoring wells in the surficial aquifer which is expected due to the larger water volumes diluting tracer concentrations in the springs for the same reason concentrations of tracer injected into the ufa fig 7 a were also lower in the springs than when injected into the surficial aquifer fig 6 e despite that more mass of rwt had been applied in the ufa although tracer injected into the ufa further from the spring eos from basin 2 or fl from basin 3 was not detected in the spring it cannot be concluded that hydraulic connections do not exist from these areas it is more likely that concentrations of eos and fl in the spring were either too dilute for accurate detection within the period of monitoring or may have arrived at the spring after monitoring ceased steady transport of fl tracer from basin 3 to basin 2 was still ongoing at the time monitoring ceased fig 7 b the estimated longitudinal dispersivity is on the same order of magnitude as reported for other karstic aquifers 2 7 6 8 m schulze makuch 2005 and the ufa 3 6 m xiao et al 2016 reed et al 2017 the comparatively lower dispersivity reported herein may be due to the relatively smaller scale of measurement schulze makuch 2005 the estimated dispersivity is the mean dispersivity of the rock medium matrix from basin 1 to silver springs under a variety of flow regimes and indicates local variations in the groundwater velocity 4 2 contaminant transport from stormwater basins and implication for stormwater management in karst regions based on results of geophysical surveys and observed movements of tracer injected into multiple stormwater management basins in the silver spring springshed a conceptual model can be proposed to hypothesize how stormwater contaminants may move between the surficial aquifer intermediate semi confining unit and ufa to eventually reach the spring both injections from basin 1 produced multiple peaks of tracer in silver springs highlighting the diversity of flowpaths that exist from both the surficial aquifer and the ufa from the stormwater basin to the springs the variable groundwater velocities observed indicate that infiltrated stormwater from basin 1 flows in a complex anisotropic karst groundwater flow condition potentially through multiple flow paths variations in size and hydraulic gradients of underground drainage systems produce diverse groundwater flow velocities and thus complex transport of contaminants to the silver springs discharge points for instance following a single pulse delivery of contaminants to basin 1 one flow pathway may deliver peak contaminant concentrations to the spring within 40 70 days while another flow pathway may produce a contaminant peak around 250 days figs 6 and 7 the similarity in behavior of tracers injected into the ufa and the surficial aquifer reveals hydraulic connections with implications for stormwater management it is expected that infiltrated stormwater will move within the shallow surficial aquifer according to darcian flow in porous media following hydraulic gradients and local hydraulic conductivity of aquifer media similar to fp 2 4 in fig 3 theory predicts that vertical groundwater flow through the semi confining unit will proceed slowly based on differences in hydraulic gradient between the water level in the unconfined surficial aquifer and the potentiometric water level in the confined ufa however the similarity in pulse elapse time of tracer injected to the ufa and surficial aquifer suggests that the role of the intermediate semi confining layer between the two may be limited hinting at the influence of heterogeneous subsurface features in connecting different parts of the surficial aquifer as in fp1 in fig 3 and the surficial aquifer to the ufa expression of karst features at the surface for example in basin 2 also highlight this possibility high conductivity zones associated with subsurface features may allow for greater connectivity between the surficial aquifer and the ufa and springs which could explain the rapid transit of tracer from the surficial aquifer in basin 1 to appear in silver springs much faster than would have been predicted based on darcian flow through homogeneous media though multiple diverse flowpaths likely exist we hypothesize that the tracer transported to the springs through at least two different mechanisms traveling through the soil matrix horizontally in the surficial aquifer and moving vertically downward to pass through the intermediate confining unit via preferential flowpaths to reach the ufa from the ufa the tracer traveled through the highly karstic features of the ufa i e rock matrix and high porosity fractures conduits 5 conclusions the objective of this study was to investigate potential subsurface pathways for urban runoff from stormwater management basins to a high magnitude freshwater spring in an area of karst hydrogeology subsurface heterogeneity of stormwater management basins within the silver springs springshed were characterized using ground based geophysical surveys ground penetrating radar and frequency domain electromagnetics and tracer tests were implemented to estimate transport rates of shallow and deep groundwater flows between the basins and silver springs as one of the first studies to investigate transport of stormwater pollutants from concentrated stormwater management areas to and within karst aquifers study outcomes may be useful to agencies aiming to protect spring and groundwater quality in silver springs and other karst regions for instance results underscore the influence of karst hydrogeology to contaminant transport from stormwater management areas multiple tracer peaks observed in silver springs with pulse velocities on the order of 10 5 10 4 ms 1 suggest that contaminants from stormwater basins may be transported to silver springs through multiple heterogeneous flowpaths from surficial and deep aquifers rapid detection of tracer in silver springs indicated maximum groundwater velocities in the springs vicinity on the order of 10 2 10 1 ms 1 while slower transport rates 10 3 ms 1 were observed further from the springs suggesting that the immediate vicinity of springs may be particularly vulnerable to stormwater contamination maximum flow velocities observed within the surficial aquifer were highly variable 10 6 to 10 3 ms 1 and transport rates in some areas were much greater than expected locations characterized by high transport rates were associated with clusters of subsurface anomalies detected by gpr and low em signal conductance potentially indicating the influence of karst features the observed high transport rates through both surficial and deep groundwater pathways may limit opportunities for biogeochemical cycling and contaminant reduction rendering stormwater bmps in karst areas less effective at reducing loads of some pollutants than in alluvial aquifers to adequately protect groundwater resources the design of stormwater bmps in karst regions should be undertaken in consideration of karst geologic configurations and implications

increased in spring water causing environmental concerns study focus pathways of groundwater movement from stormwater management areas to silver springs were investigated using ground based geophysical surveys ground penetrating radar and frequency domain electromagnetics accompanied by tracer tests in the upper floridan aquifer ufa and surficial aquifer results indicated heterogeneous near surface and deep karst conditions where stormwater runoff may be transported quickly through groundwater to the spring a wide range of groundwater velocities 10 6 to 10 3 ms 1 were observed in the surficial aquifer where faster flow speeds were associated with subsurface anomalies and preferential flow however tracer injected into the ufa was observed in the spring hours later suggesting possible maximum groundwater velocities on the order of 10 1 ms 1 in the karst aquifer series of tracer pulses in the spring highlight the complexity of flow pathways to silver springs new hydrological insights for the region the rapid transport of tracer from stormwater basins to silver springs suggests that stormwater infiltration basins may be hotspots for potential aquifer and

aquifers requires a basinwide approach stormwater infiltration areas may be locations of particular vulnerability as diffuse pollutants are concentrated to these locations during runoff events weiss et al 2008 moore and beck 2018 the typically thin surface soils found in epikarst of well developed karst areas may allow contaminated surface water such as urban stormwater runoff to discharge into groundwater through open sinkholes or infiltrate relatively quickly through subsurface karst features and fractures potentially limiting the effectiveness of stormwater management basins in attenuating contaminants byle 2001 behroozi 2019 for example stormwater management basins are typical stormwater best management practices bmps applied in karst areas of florida and must be permitted as meeting specific design and performance standards to guarantee water quality and quantity requirements of the stormwater management system e g harper and baker 2007 erp 2013 however even though geometric designs minimum infiltration rates and vadose zone capacities are specified e g retention basins should infiltrate runoff within 24 72 h of event should have minimum unsaturated subsurface storage 0 3 1 m above the seasonal groundwater table and side slopes should not be steeper than 3 1 the presence of subsurface anomalies and sinkholes may increase expected infiltration rates and negatively influence treatment performance a better understanding of how stormwater management basins function within karst areas can help establish better strategies for stormwater management groundwater protection and water quality restoration to address these research gaps and provide guidance for stormwater runoff management the objective of this research is to characterize subsurface conditions in stormwater management basins within the silver springs springshed and to observe travel times of shallow and deep groundwater flow from stormwater management basins to surface discharge in silver springs this study is one of the first to directly investigate how stormwater may be transported to and within karst aquifers which is important information for water resources managers aiming to protect or remediate water quality in karst regions 2 methodology 2 1 study area the silver springs springshed approximately 2362 km2 discharges groundwater to silver springs one of the largest karst springs in florida knowles et al 2010 german 2010 fig 1 a silver springs is located 10 km east of the city of ocala and forms the headwaters of the silver river where flow gauged at the silver river monitoring station usgs 02239501 represents combined discharge from multiple spring vents the climate of north central florida is humid subtropical with warm rainy summers june to september and mild dry winters with mean annual precipitation and temperature of about 1520 mm and 22 c respectively noaa 2017 the mean annual groundwater discharge 1933 2007 from silver springs is about 22 7 m3 s mainly supplied by the upper floridan aquifer ufa which is a sequence of thick 300 460 m eogenetic karst phelps 2004 phelps et al 2006 knowles et al 2010 the majority of groundwater flow in the ufa about 86 occurs in the top 30 m of the aquifer which is a granular limestone and the dolomite formation of ocala limestone upper eocene faulkner 1970 knowles et al 2010 the ufa is separated from a perched surficial aquifer pliocene to holocene by a semi confining unit of interbedded quartz sand silt and clay of the hawthorn group miocene knowles et al 2002 phelps 2004 the surficial aquifer consists of sand silty sand to clay sediments of varied thickness and may be locally absent where carbonate rocks are exposed phelps 2004 knowles 1996 geomorphologically the silver springs springshed has a low gradient 55 m of relief and the lowest elevation corresponds to the location of main silver springs vents forming a local base level for groundwater the dissolution of karst rocks has resulted in numerous shallow sinkholes depressions and fractures distributed around silver springs faulkner 1970 phelps 2004 three study areas basins 1 3 within the silver springs springshed were chosen forming a transect across the springshed in the direction of expected prevalent groundwater flow west to east fig 1 and table 1 the study areas are all dry stormwater management basins where stormwater runoff from surrounding roadways drains into the basins and infiltrates to recharge the groundwater system through basin soils basin 1 29º12 55 n and 82º03 30 w is owned and managed by florida department of transportation and basins 2 29º12 06 n and 82º05 01 w and 3 29º11 57 n and 82º05 53 w are managed by the city of ocala bore hole data obtained in the basins indicated the existence of a surficial aquifer consisting of unconsolidated sand and silty sandy soil from the surface to about 3 m depth a consolidated semi confining unit of quartz sand silt and clay of from 3 to 6 m depth and limestone below 6 m kibler et al 2020 several sinkholes had been reported in basins 2 eleven and 3 fourteen florida department of transportation 2019 fig 1 b the presence of these known sinkholes indicates that these basins may be potential hotspots for groundwater contamination basin 1 was chosen for study due to its proximity to the main vents of silver springs during initial field surveys three sinkholes were observed in basin 2 including a large open sinkhole and two sinkholes were observed in basin 3 including a large collapsed sinkhole and a deep small soil pipe fig 2 2 2 experimental procedure 2 2 1 geophysical surveys the subsurface of study areas was characterized to a maximum depth of 15 m below surface using two geophysical methods gpr and em gpr was performed using a gssi sir 3000 with a 270 mega hertz mhz antenna using 512 samples per scan the gpr was used to detect subsurface geological features anomalies to depths of 6 6 7 m that could be related to development of buried karst features gpr data were collected on 3 m grids across each site using a time range setting of 110 nano seconds ns for basin 1 and 150 ns for basins 2 and 3 em data were collected over 6 m transects using a geonics em34 3 with a 10 m coil separation the em responses were used to understand the spatial variation of subsurface conductivity across the basins where areas of low signal conductivity typically represent higher hydraulic conductivities chalikakis et al 2011 the em data were collected using both a vertical coplanar horizontal dipole and horizontal coplanar vertical dipole coil configurations providing an effective exploration range of 7 5 m and 15 m respectively mcneill 1980 based on results from the gpr survey and severe anomalies a transect of monitoring wells was established across 5 km of the springshed establishing one well in each basin 1 3 the 10 cm diameter wells were installed to depths that allowed tracer injection directly into the ufa 6 0 m in basin 1 and 7 6 m in basins 2 and 3 figs 1 and 3 in addition to the monitoring wells installed in the ufa hereafter deep wells a network of 12 relatively shallow 3 0 m depth monitoring wells hereafter shallow wells was installed within the surficial aquifer of basin 1 figs 1 and 3 groundwater level was monitored continuously 15 min interval in the surficial aquifer of basin 1 in well 7 over the first tracer experiment using pressure sensors onset hobo u20 and u20l installed at the ground surface and at a depth of 3 m groundwater level was measured in the deep wells at the start of the second tracer test inflow runoff volumes from the roadway into basin 1 were determined from pressure transducers installed in stilling wells near runoff inlets wen et al 2020 groundwater discharge at silver springs was obtained from the usgs silver river monitoring station 2 2 2 tracer tests tracer experiments were undertaken under natural flow field conditions to evaluate groundwater flow in the surface aquifer in the vicinity of silver springs and in the ufa across a section of the silver springs basin to characterize shallow groundwater flows in the vicinity of silver springs approximately 7 0 kg of rhodamine wt rwt was injected on july 25 2017 into the surficial aquifer from well 0 in basin 1 fig 3 followed by 1420 l of water at a rate of 0 25 ls 1 rwt tracer was monitored within the shallow well network in basin 1 and at the silver river station located approximately 1 7 km from the injection point and 1 1 km from the main silver springs discharge vent fig 1 the tracer was assumed to travel from the injection point to the main silver springs vent mammoth spring and then flow in the silver river as open channel flow to the silver river station groundwater from the wells and spring water samples 200 ml were collected with hand pumps and portable pump samplers sigma 900max and tested in triplicate for mean tracer concentration over a period of 9 months following tracer injection water samples were collected at short intervals every 1 2 h immediately after tracer injection and gradually increased to once a day and once a week as time progressed from the time of injection when rwt was no longer detectable in silver springs nearly 2 years after first tracer injection a second tracer test was undertaken at the springshed scale three tracer dyes with distinctive emittance rwt eosine eos and fluorescein fl ozark underground lab inc were injected into the ufa through the deep monitoring wells fig 1 tracers 11 3 kg of rwt 13 6 kg of eos and 11 3 kg of fl were diluted with water 1 5 before simultaneous injection into deep wells in basins 1 basin 2 and basin 3 on may 22 2019 followed by flushing with 1130 l water fig 1 groundwater and spring water samples were collected regularly from deep wells in basins 1 and 2 and from the silver river monitoring station and tested for tracer concentration over a period of 9 months from tracer injection sampling started at 1 hr intervals at the time of tracer injection and increased to 3 5 10 and 24 hr intervals all tracer samples were kept in dark cool conditions 5 c and tracer concentration was measured in triplicate after filtration through a 0 2 µm nylon membrane concentrations of rwt and fl were measured using two absorbance channels of an aquaflour handheld fluorimeter while eos concentrations were measured using a rf 5000 spectrofluorophotometer farmer and blew 2010 aley and beeman 2015 aley 2019 all readings were converted to ppb equivalents using calibration curves created using standard solutions of known concentration for each tracer 2 2 3 analysis methods gpr data were processed using radan 7 software and adjustments were made to remove air ground contacts in order to provide an accurate estimation of the depth to gpr signal reflectors a dielectric constant of 6 was chosen for the analysis which is appropriate for semi saturated sandy sediments in florida gpr anomalies were identified based upon the localized increase in penetration depth and amplitude of the gpr signal at depth relative to the surrounding areas em transects were interpolated to contour maps of conductivity using kriging geospatial methods the gpr and em results were compared qualitatively to detect convergence in conductivity gradients and locations of subsurface anomalies which guided the placement of monitoring wells maximum and average pulse groundwater velocities were estimated based respectively on the first arrival time of tracer after injection knochenmus 1967 taylor and greene 2008 mcgurk et al 2012 or the time of peak tracer concentration knochenmus 1967 mcgurk et al 2012 yang et al 2019 groundwater velocity was estimated considering the straight line distance between injection and monitoring points l and the time t elapsed from tracer injection to the detection of tracer above background to estimate maximum velocity v max or the time of peak concentration to estimate average pulse velocity v hydraulic gradient was estimated considering the water table elevation difference and distance between monitoring wells and the local base flow level in silver springs main vent using the maximum observed groundwater velocity reynolds number r e was estimated eq 1 czachor 2011 where ρ m l 3 and μ m l 1 t 1 are the density and dynamic viscosity of water v max l t 1 is the maximum observed groundwater velocity d and θ are the pore diameter l and porosity l l 1 respectively 0 5 mm and 0 3 for sandy soil 1 r e ρ v max d μ 1 θ the breakthrough curve of rwt in the silver river station indicated a positive skewness which could possibly be a result of non equilibrium effects created by immobile fluid regions field and pinsky 2000 goldscheider 2008 to estimate dispersivity in such a case a two region non equilibrium transport model was fit to the rwt breakthrough curve eqs 2 and 3 2 β r c 1 t d vl 2 c 1 z c 1 z ω c 1 c 2 μ 1 c 1 3 1 β r c 2 t ω c 1 c 2 μ 2

solute concentrations in the flowing and stagnant regions respectively and μ 1 and μ 2 refer to dimensionless solute decay in equilibrium and non equilibrium regions respectively field and pinsky 2000

affecting solute transport and r is adjustable model parameter field and pinsky 2000 the mass transfer coefficient ω describes exchange between the two fluid regions ω 0 where high values mean intense mass transfer between two fluid regions eqs 2 and 3 were solved numerically using the qtracer2 program and the model was fitted following toride et al 1999 and epa 2002 for this estimation 297 data points were applied 3 results 3 1 geophysical surveys gpr data detected many subsurface anomalies at depths ranging from 0 5 to 6 7 m below the local surface in the basins table 1 respectively 53 and 64 near surface anomalies potential karst features were detected in basins 1 and 3 detailed locations can be obtained in supplementary kml file the gpr profiles suggest wide and relatively deep anomalies potentially due to sediment depression in surficial aquifer due to water percolation fig 4 the spatial distribution of detected anomalies in basin 3 correlated well with the locations of the reported and observed sinkholes figs 1 and 5 despite the presence of reported and observed sinkholes in basin 2 only one minor near surface anomaly was detected by gpr fig 5c and d and table 1 observed sinkholes and gpr anomalies were found within regions characterized by low em signal conductivity figs 1 and 5 which is associated with areas of low clay content greater hydraulic conductivity and subsurface groundwater drainage routes kovalevsky et al 2004 despite the higher sensitivity of the vertical dipole mode to geological anomalies nobes 1999 caminha maciel and figueiredo 2013 data taken from the horizontal dipole mode provided a better correlation with observed sinkhole locations fig 5 in basin 1 the em data were spurious potentially due to interference from surrounding utilities 3 2 solute transport in surficial aquifer after rwt was introduced into the surficial aquifer of basin 1 near silver springs the range of observed maximum horizontal groundwater flow speeds 10 3 to 10 6 m s table 2 estimated based on first instances of tracer detection in the wellfield suggests variable flowpaths and transport mechanisms of shallow groundwater in the spring vicinity tracer movement revealed four distinctive patterns of groundwater flow behavior that varied according to location relative to the tracer injection site fig 3 and table 2 the first flow pattern fp1 with the fastest travel time 9 2 438 7 m d r e from 0 04 to 1 9 was seen in wells 9 11 located northeast of the injection site along the predominant direction of the regional groundwater flow towards silver springs and within a region where severe subsurface anomalies were detected by gpr figs 3 4 5 and 6a tracer was detected almost immediately after injection less than one hour in wells 10 and 11 table 2 the second flow pattern fp2 was observed in wells 7 and 8 with velocity in range of 1 2 1 4 m d r e from 7 6 10 3 to 8 8 10 3 figs 3 and 6 b tracer was detected after 13 days in wells 7 and 8 following a heavy rainfall that discharged approximately 182 m3 of stormwater runoff to the basin r1 fig 6 infiltration of the stormwater runoff led to local increase in elevation of the groundwater table which may have accelerated transport of the tracer the third flow pattern fp3 was characterized by a lower groundwater velocity 0 3 0 8 m d r e from 2 1 10 3 to 5 2 10 3 observed in wells 1 3 which were located southeast of the injection site table 2 tracer was detected in wells 1 3 about 35 days after injection fig 6 c a rainfall event occurred 21 days after the injection discharging approximately 148 m3 stormwater runoff r2 to the basin that could have likely driven the tracer movement simultaneous tracer pulses associated within this runoff event are detected in wells 7 11 fig 6 a and b the fourth flow pattern fp4 with the lowest maximum groundwater velocity 0 2 0 4 m d r e from 1 2 10 3 to 2 5 10 3 was seen in wells 4 6 after about 107 128 days from the injection figs 3 6 d and table 2 the tropical hurricane irma r3 occurred on day 48 following tracer injection fig 6 this event discharged about 1907 m3 stormwater runoff to the basin and increased groundwater levels for weeks presumably opening up new subsurface flowpaths despite this tracer did not appear in wells 4 6 until 59 days after the storm fig 6 d rwt was first detected at the silver river monitoring station 3 5 h after injection into well 0 in basin 1 suggesting a maximum velocity of about 10 900 m d 0 13 m s between the surficial aquifer and the monitoring point in silver river fig 6 e table 2 the hydraulic gradient was estimated during this time as 4 7 10 3 the breakthrough curve in silver river indicated four distinct concentration pulses the first peaking at 53 1 ppb 42 days after tracer injection fig 6 e the second third and fourth peak concentrations ranged from 26 1 to 39 5 ppb and were observed respectively 115 177 and 246 days after injection based upon these tracer pulses pulse groundwater velocities between the surficial aquifer in basin 1 and silver springs are estimated in the range of 2 3 13 5 m d table 3 groundwater flow discharge in silver springs increased from 11 6 to 20 3 m3 s over the monitoring period with a relatively sharp increase after hurricane irma r3 which closely followed the first observed peak concentration fig 6 e the hydraulic gradient from the surficial aquifer to the spring increased from 3 9 10 3 to 4 2 10 3 following the hurricane it is likely that the elevated groundwater table and spring discharge that lasted weeks after the hurricane had an influence to the delivery of tracer following the first observed peak 3 3 solute transport in upper floridan aquifer the rwt injected into the ufa from basin 1 was detected above background at the silver river station about two hours indicating a maximum ufa groundwater velocity of 19 200 m d 0 22 m s in the vicinity of silver springs fig 7 a table 2 while the hydraulic gradient was estimated as about 4 7 10 3 reynolds number of the observed maximum groundwater velocities 71 and 121 calculated assuming flow through porous media eq 1 indicates turbulent flow condition it is therefore unlikely that this flow was sustained through a homogenous porous medium but instead was transported through conduit flow following the first detection tracer concentrations remained low for several days but began to increase steadily after about 8 days and reached a peak concentration of 4 6 ppb after about 70 days fig 7 a concentrations returned to near baseline by around 140 days and then increased again in a lower more diffuse peak about 245 days from the injection fig 7 a pulse groundwater velocities based on timing of these tracer peaks were about 2 3 7 9 m d table 3 the breakthrough curve indicated that most detected tracer traveled to the spring within about 100 days after the injection fig 7 a and that the bulk of this mass was captured from 8 to 100 days after injection a two region non equilibrium model fitted to the main breakthrough curve suggests that the dispersivity of the aquifer is about 1 8 m neither eos from basin 2 nor fl from basin 3 injected into the ufa were observed at the silver river monitoring station table 2 eos was never observed in any monitoring location the hydraulic gradient between basin 2 and silver springs and basin 3 and silver springs was estimated as 3 5 10 4 and 2 3 10 4 respectively however fl was detected in the ufa below basin 2 approximately 6 days after injection in basin 3 suggesting a maximum groundwater velocity between basins 3 and 2 of 233 m d fig 7 b table 2 under a hydraulic gradient of about 2 2 10 4 the observed fl concentration increased slowly after detection from 0 08 to 1 9 ppb by around 61 days then increased rapidly to 18 3 ppb by 86 days fig 7 b from 86 to around 200 days fl concentrations remained largely at a steady state varying between 18 3 and 22 7 ppb concentrations began to increase again after 214 days and continued to increase through the cessation of monitoring fig 7 b 4 discussion 4 1 groundwater flow velocities groundwater velocities observed in most areas of the surficial aquifer fp2 to fp4 are comparable to those reported for saturated sandy and silty sandy soil media 1 m d matthess and pekdeger 1985 fetter et al 1999 dingman 2002 velocities and reynolds numbers are consistent with low head darcian flow through the well sorted sands with few fine particle fractions reported for the surface soils in basin 1 chang et al 2015 rice 2018 observed velocities in fp2 fp4 wells are also within the range of horizontal groundwater velocities observed in other sandy surficial aquifers in non karst areas in florida 0 02 0 42 m d corbett et al 2000 however the near immediate detection of tracer in fp1 wells indicates that groundwater flows in some parts of the surficial aquifer may fall outside of the range expected by transport through homogeneous sandy media and may be related to the influence of macropores in subsurface strata etana et al 2013 fig 3 and table 2 for example the maximum groundwater velocities observed in fp1 wells based on the first arrival time of tracer demonstrates that macropores and subsurface features as detected by gpr may allow for advective transport of stormwater in the shallow subsurface in contrast the maximum groundwater velocities observed in fp4 wells wells 4 6 could correlate to matrix flow speeds with large contributions of dispersive or diffusive transport sudicky et al 1983 the maximum groundwater velocities observed in the ufa 233 19 200 m d indicate the presence of rapid groundwater flow paths especially from the ufa under basin 1 to the silver river monitoring station table 2 the comparison of maximum groundwater velocities observed in silver springs when the tracer was injected at a similar location basin 1 but at different depths into the ufa vs the surficial aquifer indicates that flow through the ufa in the immediate vicinity of silver springs was almost twice as fast as flow from the surficial aquifer table 2 and fig 6 while we cannot differentiate groundwater velocity from the transport time of open channel flow results suggest that groundwater velocity in the ufa from basin 1 to silver springs is fast potentially within large conduits under high hydraulic gradients as groundwater flows converge to the silver springs discharge vents to reach the spring tracer injected into the surficial aquifer had to move either through the surficial aquifer to the spring or pass through the intermediate confining layer to reach the ufa in addition the maximum groundwater velocities observed in the ufa are comparable to groundwater velocities reported in other karst areas for example the mcconnell springs 7600 m d norris et al 2016 and mystery spring 2680 m d martin et al 2019 in kentucky and the blautopf spring watershed in germany 1224 to 13 872 m d lauber et al 2014 the relatively high groundwater velocity observed in the ufa in this study may be partially associated to the eogenetic karst of the study area which is characterized by higher matrix porosity relative to the dense telogenetic karst with lower matrix porosity found in kentucky vacher and mylroie 2002 florea and vacher 2006 however the location of study in basin 1 in close proximity to the high magnitude spring vents may also have contributed to the high velocities observed in the spring vicinity for instance the lower maximum groundwater velocity observed in the ufa further from the spring vents 233 m d between basins 3 and 2 is comparable to maximum velocities previously reported in the ufa near silver springs 702 m d knochenmus 1967 despite considerable differences in the maximum groundwater velocities observed in the ufa and surficial aquifer groundwater velocities estimated based on the times of peak concentrations in the spring 2 3 and 13 5 m d respectively are similar in the two tracer inspections from basin 1 table 3 these are also similar to mean groundwater velocities reported in some earlier tracer studies of the ufa in the vicinity of silver springs 10 2 91 4 m d phelps 1994 although greater mean groundwater velocities have also been reported in ufa near silver springs e g 350 m d knochenmus 1967 213 427 m d mcgurk et al 2012 and 8 4 317 m d yang et al 2019 further mean groundwater velocities reported in this and other studies near silver springs are comparable to estimated mean groundwater velocities in other karst areas of florida e g 42 299 m d near wekiva spring fdep 2016 and 31 298 m d in wakulla spring kincaid et al 2012 tracer concentrations observed in silver springs were low for instance relative to concentrations observed in the monitoring wells in the surficial aquifer which is expected due to the larger water volumes diluting tracer concentrations in the springs for the same reason concentrations of tracer injected into the ufa fig 7 a were also lower in the springs than when injected into the surficial aquifer fig 6 e despite that more mass of rwt had been applied in the ufa although tracer injected into the ufa further from the spring eos from basin 2 or fl from basin 3 was not detected in the spring it cannot be concluded that hydraulic connections do not exist from these areas it is more likely that concentrations of eos and fl in the spring were either too dilute for accurate detection within the period of monitoring or may have arrived at the spring after monitoring ceased steady transport of fl tracer from basin 3 to basin 2 was still ongoing at the time monitoring ceased fig 7 b the estimated longitudinal dispersivity is on the same order of magnitude as reported for other karstic aquifers 2 7 6 8 m schulze makuch 2005 and the ufa 3 6 m xiao et al 2016 reed et al 2017 the comparatively lower dispersivity reported herein may be due to the relatively smaller scale of measurement schulze makuch 2005 the estimated dispersivity is the mean dispersivity of the rock medium matrix from basin 1 to silver springs under a variety of flow regimes and indicates local variations in the groundwater velocity 4 2 contaminant transport from stormwater basins and implication for stormwater management in karst regions based on results of geophysical surveys and observed movements of tracer injected into multiple stormwater management basins in the silver spring springshed a conceptual model can be proposed to hypothesize how stormwater contaminants may move between the surficial aquifer intermediate semi confining unit and ufa to eventually reach the spring both injections from basin 1 produced multiple peaks of tracer in silver springs highlighting the diversity of flowpaths that exist from both the surficial aquifer and the ufa from the stormwater basin to the springs the variable groundwater velocities observed indicate that infiltrated stormwater from basin 1 flows in a complex anisotropic karst groundwater flow condition potentially through multiple flow paths variations in size and hydraulic gradients of underground drainage systems produce diverse groundwater flow velocities and thus complex transport of contaminants to the silver springs discharge points for instance following a single pulse delivery of contaminants to basin 1 one flow pathway may deliver peak contaminant concentrations to the spring within 40 70 days while another flow pathway may produce a contaminant peak around 250 days figs 6 and 7 the similarity in behavior of tracers injected into the ufa and the surficial aquifer reveals hydraulic connections with implications for stormwater management it is expected that infiltrated stormwater will move within the shallow surficial aquifer according to darcian flow in porous media following hydraulic gradients and local hydraulic conductivity of aquifer media similar to fp 2 4 in fig 3 theory predicts that vertical groundwater flow through the semi confining unit will proceed slowly based on differences in hydraulic gradient between the water level in the unconfined surficial aquifer and the potentiometric water level in the confined ufa however the similarity in pulse elapse time of tracer injected to the ufa and surficial aquifer suggests that the role of the intermediate semi confining layer between the two may be limited hinting at the influence of heterogeneous subsurface features in connecting different parts of the surficial aquifer as in fp1 in fig 3 and the surficial aquifer to the ufa expression of karst features at the surface for example in basin 2 also highlight this possibility high conductivity zones associated with subsurface features may allow for greater connectivity between the surficial aquifer and the ufa and springs which could explain the rapid transit of tracer from the surficial aquifer in basin 1 to appear in silver springs much faster than would have been predicted based on darcian flow through homogeneous media though multiple diverse flowpaths likely exist we hypothesize that the tracer transported to the springs through at least two different mechanisms traveling through the soil matrix horizontally in the surficial aquifer and moving vertically downward to pass through the intermediate confining unit via preferential flowpaths to reach the ufa from the ufa the tracer traveled through the highly karstic features of the ufa i e rock matrix and high porosity fractures conduits 5 conclusions the objective of this study was to investigate potential subsurface pathways for urban runoff from stormwater management basins to a high magnitude freshwater spring in an area of karst hydrogeology subsurface heterogeneity of stormwater management basins within the silver springs springshed were characterized using ground based geophysical surveys ground penetrating radar and frequency domain electromagnetics and tracer tests were implemented to estimate transport rates of shallow and deep groundwater flows between the basins and silver springs as one of the first studies to investigate transport of stormwater pollutants from concentrated stormwater management areas to and within karst aquifers study outcomes may be useful to agencies aiming to protect spring and groundwater quality in silver springs and other karst regions for instance results underscore the influence of karst hydrogeology to contaminant transport from stormwater management areas multiple tracer peaks observed in silver springs with pulse velocities on the order of 10 5 10 4 ms 1 suggest that contaminants from stormwater basins may be transported to silver springs through multiple heterogeneous flowpaths from surficial and deep aquifers rapid detection of tracer in silver springs indicated maximum groundwater velocities in the springs vicinity on the order of 10 2 10 1 ms 1 while slower transport rates 10 3 ms 1 were observed further from the springs suggesting that the immediate vicinity of springs may be particularly vulnerable to stormwater contamination maximum flow velocities observed within the surficial aquifer were highly variable 10 6 to 10 3 ms 1 and transport rates in some areas were much greater than expected locations characterized by high transport rates were associated with clusters of subsurface anomalies detected by gpr and low em signal conductance potentially indicating the influence of karst features the observed high transport rates through both surficial and deep groundwater pathways may limit opportunities for biogeochemical cycling and contaminant reduction rendering stormwater bmps in karst areas less effective at reducing loads of some pollutants than in alluvial aquifers to adequately protect groundwater resources the design of stormwater bmps in karst regions should be undertaken in consideration of karst geologic configurations and implications

replicating the landscape and hydrology of the surrounding boreal systems porewater in these materials contain elevated levels of salts and other solutes water quality will govern the success and sustainability of the reclaimed landscape tightly coupled water and heat dynamics control water and solute movement in boreal systems we used three dimensional integrated surface subsurface flow and chloride transport models with and without ground freezing thawing to compare performance of an in pit oil sands mine currently being reclaimed new hydrological insights for the region transient simulations under wet dry climate cycles suggest that the reclaimed landform will shed water only during wet years annual water balance with and without coupled heat dynamics is identical however the three dimensional representation of ground freeze thaw results in reduced snowmelt infiltration summer groundwater table and solute release during winter the outcome is increased spring runoff 20 decrease in chloride mass release over simulated eight year wet climate cycle and relatively reduced summer runoff the model results suggest that 1 coupled heat dynamics should be considered for detailed evaluation of reclaimed in pit landforms at finer time scales and 2 modeling reclaimed landforms without freeze thaw provides conservative annual solute release estimates which is appropriate for coarse site wide models keywords oil sands mine reclamation hydrogeosphere surface water groundwater interactions ground freeze thaw 1 introduction the alberta oil sands are located in the canadian boreal plains the oil sands mines reaching end of operations are being progressively reclaimed as per regulations oil sands mines are to be reclaimed to a land capability that is equivalent to pre mining conditions i e locally common boreal ecosystems aer 2018 specifically the reclaimed landforms are expected to provide an equivalent capability to store and transmit water while merging into the surrounding boreal landscape ketcheson et al 2017 nagare et al 2018 biagi et al 2021 water quality and water budget within reclaimed oil sands landscapes need to be evaluated to predict the sustainability of the closure drainage designs and to demonstrate alignment with proposed end land use objectives ketcheson et al 2016 biagi et al 2019 2021 hartsock et al 2021 water movement in boreal regions is characterized by tight surface water and groundwater coupling wherein evapotranspiration makes up the majority of outflow hayashi et al 1998a laudon et al 2007 devito et al 2012 smerdon et al 2007 ketcheson et al 2017 given the cold regions climate of oil sands region water and solute cycling is driven by both water and heat dynamics hayashi et al 1998a 1998b devito et al 2012 ketcheson and price 2016a huang et al 2018 biagi and carey 2020 oil sands mine reclamation designs need to incorporate these hydrological characteristics of the boreal regions oil sands mines are being reclaimed using mined out materials e g peat overburden tailings sand that is stockpiled during mining use of these materials presents water quality challenges for revegetation and water discharge from reclaimed landscape for example tailings sand is used to construct in pit tailings landforms and the hydraulically placed sand holds oil sands process affected water ospw which contains elevated levels of salts and other constituents of interest cois understanding mobility of these cois by meteoric water during wet climate cycles and water availability for vegetation and end pit lakes during dry climate cycles is essential for the proper evaluation of reclamation designs kessler et al 2010 ketcheson et al 2016 nagare et al 2018 water recharging on uplands flushes the shallow subsurface materials and discharges salts and cois to low lying areas in reclaimed landscapes a process that mimics the functioning of natural boreal upland wetland systems smerdon et al 2005 2007 kessel et al 2018 nagare et al 2018 such flushing and upward movement of water in unsaturated zone by capillary action can evapoaccumulate salts and cois in root zone and on surface of the wetlands and uplands dobchuk et al 2012 rezanezhad et al 2012 ketcheson et al 2016 simhayov et al 2017 nagare et al 2018 therefore performance evaluations of reclamation designs compare nature of surface water and groundwater interactions location of groundwater table solute flushing mechanisms and water volume and solute mass release rates from the landforms to design criteria and feed the results into the engineering process for design optimization solute cycling within the landform includes advective flushing of the hummocks and diffusive flushing of the underlying fine tailings dobchuk et al 2012 nagare et al 2015a 2018 biagi et al 2019 the groundwater table location governs geotechnical and hydrotechnical stability of the landform nagare et al 2018 it also governs the salinization potential of the root zone of the treed upland vegetation dobchuk et al 2012 nagare et al 2015a 2018 understanding of surface water groundwater interactions flushing of shallow subsurface and salinization potential of the root zone is the main driver for cover soil design research in oil sands reclamation this includes investigations of changes in properties of covers due to freeze thaw thickness requirements to offset salinization by upward movement of water and changing role of cover soils in hydrology of reclaimed slopes with aging kelln et al 2008 kessler et al 2010 meiers et al 2011 ketcheson and price 2016b numerical models are often used to analyze water and solute cycling within design landscapes dobchuk et al 2012 huang et al 2018 lukenbach et al 2019 nagare et al 2018 there is no consistency of models used to represent constructed systems in the oil sands region as models have been chosen and developed to examine a specific process or operational questions focusing on decoupled overland groundwater flow or inorganic solute transport biagi and carey 2020 furthermore these models are often too simplistic often one or two dimensional and do not comprehensively represent all the hydrological processes e g evapotranspiration frozen ground etc that govern the water and solute cycling in reclaimed landforms biagi and carey 2020 nagare et al 2015a 2018 frozen ground in reclaimed landforms can impede infiltration and increase overland flow during spring melt ketcheson and price 2016a ground frost in wetland can delay groundwater outflow ketcheson et al 2017 and snowmelt rate and partitioning can govern the timing of combined runoff from a reclaimed oil sands landform biagi and carey 2020 these processes can lead to increased freshwater outflow from reclaimed landforms a process critical to sustainability water quality and quantity of downstream end pit lakes despite of its critical importance ground freeze thaw is rarely incorporated in analysis of hydrology of reclaimed oil sands landforms biagi and carey 2020 given the tightly coupled surface water and groundwater processes in boreal settings integrated surface water and groundwater flow and solute transport modeling is well suited to evaluate post closure landscape performance smerdon et al 2005 2007 price et al 2010 carrera hernández et al 2011 nagare et al 2015a 2018 there are not many examples of integrated modeling let alone with ground freeze thaw to support oil sands mine reclamation designs integrated models have the capability to simulate coupled water and heat dynamics schilling et al 2019 but such simulations may come at an increased computational cost and effort to parameterize the model huang et al 2018 it is therefore important to strike a balance in inclusion of details of processes while using integrated models to support evaluation of reclaimed landforms in this study we demonstrate the combined use of a three dimensional 3d integrated flow and solute transport model and a one dimensional 1d coupled flow and heat transport model to analyze water and solute dynamics with frozen ground processes in an in pit oil sands mine currently under reclamation the reclaimed mine consists of coarse sand tailings hummocks draining into low lying flatter areas similar to the general boreal setting of treed uplands surrounded by organic wetlands the objective of the study was to develop a practical coupled water heat and chloride transport modeling approach using physically based integrated models to support oil sands mine reclamation the 3d modeling included the most important hydrological and solute transport processes e g surface atmosphere interactions snowmelt rate and timing frozen ground processes unsaturated zone processes and overland subsurface flow and transport coupling the 1d and 3d models ensured striking a reasonable balance between inclusion of details of processes and computational burden and parameterization effort specifically we investigated the effect of frozen ground on spring melt runoff rate timing and outflow water quality changes to seasonal groundwater table location and annual water and solute balances when frozen ground processes are included and excluded from the model there is limited direct data from the reclaimed landform to confirm the model performance data from other compatible reclaimed and natural sites was used to validate the model performance the modeling results are being used as a guide to optimize reclamation processes and to develop monitoring plans once the landform is fully reclaimed 2 methods 2 1 study case example the reclaimed mine pit site is an in pit mine currently being reclaimed by syncrude canada ltd syncrude syncrude mine site is located 40 km north of fort mcmurray alberta canada the study area is shown in fig 1 the area of the reclaimed watershed modeled in this study is 8 4 km2 the reclamation design was completed over multiple years in the past decade the mine pit was backfilled with a mixture of fluid fine tailings and sand tailings together called composite tailings or ct to create upland wetland systems typical of coarse textured natural systems in the boreal forests the ct filled pit is being covered with a series of upland sand hummocks fig 2 the area between hummocks form swales valleys and the hummock swale system is sloped towards a flat low lying area connected to the landform outlet at closure the outlet of the reclaimed landform will be connected to an end pit lake by a surface closure channel the hummocks and the low lying area are being covered with soil covers to promote vegetation growth at reclamation the elevated sand tailings hummocks will support treed vegetation and drain into the low lying wetland areas the low lying area is intended to evolve into a wetland supporting native wetland vegetation species the soil covers comprise of an upper layer of salvaged peat overlying a layer of salvaged glacial clay soil dobchuk et al 2012 nagare et al 2018 as already introduced the tailings sands and ct are constructed primarily by hydraulically transporting in ospw and therefore contain elevated levels of saline pore fluid at their placement the model layers bottom to top consist of thick composite tailings that filled the pit at end of mining the ct is covered by a minimum 1 m thick tailings sand cover throughout the model domain the tailings sand cover is overlain by tailings sand hummocks 1 10 m thick in areas where uplands were constructed the sand hummocks uplands and minimum 1 m thick tailings sand cover low lying areas is covered with surficial vegetation cover soil layer made up of 0 25 m peat overlying a glacial till layer of the same thickness the base of the mine pit was excavated into mcmurray formation which is a bitumen filled low permeability geological unit therefore no significant subsurface fluxes are expected to leave the reclaimed landform through the mcmurray formation subsurface water transfer will be limited to the shallow subsurface through the tailings sand hummocks water input to the landform will be from rain and snow and water transfer out of the landform will be by evapotranspiration et and overland flow at the landform outlet flowing into the closure drainage channel the et is controlled by the vegetation distribution over the landform the study was limited to early reclamation timeline first 10 years after reclamation the uplands hummocks were assumed to be vegetated by treed species and the swales and low lying areas by shrubs and wetland species the vegetation is still being planned but based on previous reclamation efforts of nearby landforms uplands are likely to be vegetated with trembling aspen populus tremuloides michx and white spruce picea glauca moench voss kessler et al 2010 huang et al 2018 and wetlands with carex aquatilis sedges arrow grasses rushes and slough grass ketcheson et al 2016 nicholls et al 2016 vitt et al 2016 the precipitation is assumed to be equally distributed over the entire landform i e no spatial variation water can flow out of the landform only when the water depth in the low lying wetland areas exceeds the outlet elevation the water depth in the wetland areas is determined by the interactions between the different principal components of the water budget of the landform precipitation inputs to the landform will be partitioned into et overland runoff and net percolation in hummock and swale areas recharge net percolation is expected to result in flushing of the upper portion of the hummocks prior to seeping into adjacent swales and low lying wetland areas where it mixes with overland flow nagare et al 2018 2 2 modeling methods hydrogeosphere aquanty 2015 was used for the 3d coupled water and solute modeling hydrogeosphere is a fully coupled surface water and groundwater flow solute and heat transport model hydrogeosphere is also capable of modeling ground freeze thaw processes schilling et al 2019 a detailed description of hydrogeosphere and its capabilities can be found in aquanty 2015 brunner and simmons 2011 maxwell et al 2014 and schilling et al 2019 triangular prism elements of different sizes were used to construct the 3d model grid each model slice in the surface and subsurface domains was discretized using 78 271 nodes and 155 640 triangular elements of different sizes the typical hummock widths in the landform are between 150 m and 400 m while the lengths are between 500 m and 1250 m the typical element side length node spacing of 20 m or smaller was used to construct the grid the model was discretized into 13 subsurface numerical layers of varying thicknesses thus the model grid consisted of 78 271 nodes and 155 640 triangular elements in the surface domain and 1 095 794 nodes and 2 023 320 triangular prisms in the subsurface domain the surface and subsurface domains were separated by a coupling length of 0 001 m model topography was based on lidar data model bottom elevation was based on surveyed mine bottom elevations the bottom of the cover soil was determined by assuming a uniform 0 5 m thickness for the layer the bottom of the tailings sand cap i e top of ct layer in the upland areas was based on the topographic survey conducted after the pit was filled with ct the top of the ct layer rises to the level of the surrounding natural ground around the mine pit time varying fluxes to represent precipitation and potential evapotranspiration boundary conditions were applied to the entire top of the model critical depth boundary condition was applied at the top boundary nodes corresponding to the watershed outlets to allow outflow when surface water depth exceeds ground elevation at these locations elsewhere a zero gradient boundary condition was used in both the surface and subsurface domains details of mathematical description of the boundary conditions can be found in aquanty 2015 model parameters are summarized in table 1 the ct layer was subdivided into upper and lower ct materials based on sand to fines ratios determined from cone penetration tests other model parameters are based on laboratory and field investigations completed by syncrude over the years and literature values mckenna 2002 shurniak and barbour 2002 nagare et al 2015a 2018 huang et al 2018 lukenbach et al 2019 biagi and carey 2020 biagi et al 2021 the climatic dataset used in the model is primarily based on 1944 2020 precipitation and air temperature measured at environment canada s fort mcmurray airport weather station the long term average annual precipitation at the station is 427 mm the average calculated annual potential evapotranspiration for 1944 2019 period is 578 mm the climate data shows multiple cycles of wet and dry periods longest of which occur from 1966 to 1978 wet cycle and 2006 2017 dry cycle the recorded average annual precipitation over the wet and the dry cycles is 504 mm and 357 mm respectively these two periods were used to model eight wet cycle and seven dry cycle years period following reclamation assumed to be at end of year 2019 this climate input captures the highest wet and lowest dry precipitation on a decadal annual and daily basis therefore the probability of occurrence of the estimated conditions is near a 100 year average recurrence interval i e considered to have a 1 chance of occurring each year the wet and dry climate cycle simulations were conducted with and without frozen ground processes the model flow initial conditions were developed by transient model spin up using 2005 2019 climate input chloride transport was modeled assuming a full strength chloride concentration throughout the reclaimed landscape based on syncrude s tailings water quality data we used a hybrid approach to model the coupled water solute and heat dynamics for this study hydrogeosphere is capable of simulating fully coupled water solute and heat transfer with ground freezing and thawing if ground surface temperatures are available to be used as a boundary condition schilling et al 2019 modeling ground freeze thaw explicitly in hydrogeosphere along with integrated surface water and groundwater flow and solute transport although possible would have made the modeling computationally excessively expensive therefore we used shaw flerchinger and saxton 1989 a one dimensional 1d fully coupled water and heat transfer code to model the ground temperatures with freezing and thawing we developed 1d models for upland and wetland conditions and calibrated the models to ground temperatures measured over two years at syncrude s nearby reclamation research plot with equivalent reclamation conditions the 1d shaw modeling was conducted for 5 m long soil columns the domain was discretized into 50 nodes a 1 mm node spacing near the ground surface was gradually increased to 50 cm at the base of the column ground freezing and thawing reduces the effective hydraulic conductivity of the active layer seasonally freezing and thawing zone andersland and anderson 1978 the frost depth varies over different years depending on antecedent moisture conditions and winter air temperature we used the daily air temperatures from fort mcmurray weather station over the modeling durations described above to model ground temperatures the shaw model results are used to determine the frost depth ice saturation and resultant effective hydraulic conductivity of the frozen zones during freezing and thawing periods the water potential in frozen soil ψ l in j kg where liquid water and ice coexist can be calculated from the absolute temperature t in k using the generalized form of the clapeyron equation flerchinger and saxton 1989 spaans and baker 1996 nagare et al 2015b 1 d ψ l λ t dt d ψ i where ψ i j kg is the ice potential and λ kj kg is the latent heat of fusion of water being approximated as a function of t as 2 λ t 712 38 5 545 t 6 28 10 3 t 2 when the gauge pressure is assumed to be zero in the ice phase the liquid potential can be calculated as 3 ψ l 712 38 ln t t 0 5 54 t t 0 3 14 10 3 t 2 t 0 2 the soil retention relation where relative permeability is a function of water potential can then be used to determine the effective hydraulic conductivity the hydraulic conductivity reduction due to the existence of ice or the reduction factor is used to scale the saturated hydraulic conductivity as a function of time for the 3d hydrogeosphere simulations during freezing and thawing periods it is noted that the transient depth of freezing and thawing zones and the hydraulic conductivity reduction factors are used in the 3d simulations as a proxy to ground freezing and thawing thus hydraulic conductivity of the layers experiencing freezing and thawing is equivalent to the 1d shaw model results in frozen zones and is internally calculated in the 3d model based on moisture content when where layers are frost free the above methodology is similar to the approaches used in langford et al 2020 and nagare et al 2021 to model coupled water and heat transport this approach allows a reasonable physically based representation of water and solute exchanges between the surface water and groundwater while overcoming the computational limitation of explicitly modeling water solute and heat transfer with freeze thaw in large 3d models 3 results and discussions 3 1 shaw modeling the 1d shaw model was first verified by comparing the simulated and observed ground temperatures for two years 2017 2018 of reported data at two syncrude research sites during the two year period the air temperature at the research sites ranged from 30 30 c with below zero being maintained for about 5 months in the winter fig 3a precipitation was more concentrated in the summer in 2018 while it was distributed more evenly over the year in 2017 fig 3b fig 3c illustrates that the temperature measured at 65 cm below ground surface was similar at the two locations and the simulated temperature could reasonably reproduce the measured ground temperatures the time depth temperature results shown in fig 3d clearly indicate that the vertical temperature profiles are strongly influenced by the material distributions at the site especially at shallow depth where the moisture content is more responsive to the recharge events precipitation and snowmelt the results also show that freezing front remains mostly in the shallow cover soil zone peat mineral mix and till layers during most of the winter season freezing front penetrates below 50 cm into the tailings sand in late winter fig 3d overall the results indicate that the 1d water heat model appears to be an effective alternative to a more comprehensive but computationally demanding 3d models to approximate shallow hydrothermal conditions in the study area the 1d shaw model was used to analyze the hydrothermal interactions near surface under dry and wet climate conditions at the reclamation site fig 4 average daily temperatures over the first 10 years of dry and wet climate cycles show that in the wet cycle it is slightly cooler but frost depth becomes shallower with increased precipitation and wetter ground conditions due to the latent heat effects fig 4 frost depth is generally deeper in the uplands compared to the wetter lowland area due to latent heat effects fig 4e f fig 5 shows the hydraulic conductivity reduction factors at three different depths in typical dry and wet years calculated using the simulated temperature and eq 3 along with the soil retention relation the results in fig 5 indicate that the hydraulic conductivity can be significantly reduced in shallow subsurface during the winter months limiting the hydrologic interactions between surface and subsurface 3 2 hydrogeosphere model verification a full model calibration of the 3d hydrogeosphere was not possible as the in pit landform is not yet fully built and long term monitoring dataset is not available therefore the model performance was verified for available data from within the partially built landform and based on data from regional natural and reclaimed watersheds groundwater elevations in a research plot twerdy 2019 and other areas within the partially built landform are available for a limited time period the measured and simulated groundwater table elevations matched within 2 m for the period of measurements seepage flux measurements from toe drains within the dykes of the partially built landform were also available the modeled seepage rate of 6 4 l s agrees reasonably with the measured seepage rate of 5 3 l s measured actual evapotranspiration aet data from an adjoining reclaimed overburden dump is available for 2003 2015 period huang et al 2018 the two landforms are different in characteristics and therefore not directly comparable the modeled aet for 2010 2015 period of 354 400 mm is fairly comparable to the measured 370 450 mm range with a mean absolute and root mean squared errors of 24 mm and 27 mm respectively 3 3 three dimensional coupled water solute and heat simulations the 3d coupled water flow and chloride transport simulations with and without ground freeze thaw were compared based on annual and seasonal water and chloride mass release at the landform outlet and timing of runoff generation 3 3 1 water outflow the modeled outflow is reported as depth in mm over the area of the reclaimed watershed which can be compared easily relative to the precipitation the model results for the wet climate cycle figs 6a and 7a suggest that annual runoff depths are 10 mm smaller 6 decrease to 28 mm greater 67 increase for simulations with frozen ground than without frozen ground the average increase in runoff over the eight years of the wet cycle is 4 mm the total runoff over the eight years is 36 mm greater 5 increase when the simulations include frozen ground for the dry climate cycle figs 6b and 7b the model results suggest that frozen ground conditions lead to an increased runoff for each year 0 11 mm increase although the runoff magnitude is much smaller than the wet cycle the total runoff over the seven year dry cycle simulation is more than three times higher with ground freezing 47 mm vs 14 mm overall the model results suggest that the difference in annual water balance is not significant with and without heat dynamics this is similar to the findings of huang et al 2018 it is noted however that annual runoff alone may not provide a complete picture of the effects of frozen ground on oil sands mine reclamation figs 6 7 and 8 clearly demonstrate the effects of frozen ground on seasonal distribution of outflow for each year of the wet and dry climate cycles the runoff increases during spring melt season while decreasing over winter and summer seasons when ground freezing and thawing is included in the model simulations for the eight years of the wet cycle the winter and summer runoffs decrease by 78 and 11 respectively while the spring melt runoff increases by 40 fig 7a for the dry climate cycle the outflow is distributed 18 46 and 36 over winter spring melt and summer seasons when modeled without ground freezing and thawing with ground freeze thaw included in the model simulations 92 of the outflow takes place during the spring season the seasonal changes to outflow due to ground freezing and thawing over eight and seven years of wet and dry climate cycles are summarized in table 2 this redistribution of outflow from the reclaimed landscape has implications for solute mass release this information is critical for decision makers to consider because water quality is the primary criteria for the success of oil sands mine reclamation and site closure the reduction in outflow during the winter season is attributed to decrease in groundwater discharge baseflow due to freezing of surface in swales and low lying areas this is consistent with observations in natural systems e g wang 2019 and in reclaimed wetlands e g ketcheson et al 2017 the reduction in summer outflow is accounted for by relatively deeper groundwater table in the low lying areas during the summer months i e relatively increased infiltration in summer this occurs because without ground freeze thaw a substantial amount of spring melt infiltrates the ground in the wetland areas and leads to increase in groundwater table this leads to increased groundwater discharge and increased outflow during summer precipitation events when frozen ground is incorporated in the model relatively increased portion of spring melt is converted into overland flow while reducing the amount of infiltration this results in deeper groundwater table in the low lying areas at the end of spring consequently more water infiltrates the ground in summer reducing the amount of outflow this is consistent with observations in natural systems fig 9 koren et al 2014 and in reclaimed landforms e g ketcheson and price 2016a biagi and carey 2020 3 3 2 solute mass release salt is a constituent of interest for reclamation planners in alberta s oil sands region long term effects of salinity on vegetation growth and end pit lake water quality sustainability are currently being studied this study is part of advancing the knowledge on quantifying salt release from reclaimed landforms chloride was used as a proxy for salt concentrations in the water cycling within the landform and in the outflow from the landform the model results suggest that there is approximately a 20 reduction in chloride mass release over the wet cycle when ground freezing effects are considered figs 10a and 11a the reduction in chloride mass release is a direct result of decreased baseflow in winter increased spring melt runoff and decreased outflow in summer the decrease in winter baseflow and summer outflow results into reduced chloride transfer from uplands to lowlands in simulations with ground freezing and thawing this is critical since this improves the water quality for wetland vegetation the 20 reduction in eight wet years is a significant reduction in solute load to the end pit lake in addition the end pit lakes receive fresher water in spring melt season the spring melt outflow chloride concentrations for simulations with freeze thaw reduce by a factor of 1 1 1 6 fig 12 over the eight years when compared to simulations without freeze thaw the summer outflow chloride concentrations remain unchanged but 11 lesser outflow results into reduced chloride mass release this is an important insight towards assessing the sustainability of the end pit lakes and overall success of oil sands mine reclamation the chloride mass release during the dry cycle is generally an order of magnitude smaller than the mass release during the wet cycle figs 10b and 11b primarily due to the reduced runoff fig 6b as discussed above the outflow increases during the dry cycle when frozen ground is included in the simulations 47 mm vs 14 mm this is primarily due to the increased spring melt contribution the spring melt outflow concentrations for simulations with freeze thaw reduce by a factor of 1 1 1 7 over the seven years when compared to simulations without freeze thaw the total chloride mass release over the seven year dry cycle simulation increases by 2 3 times 208 000 kg vs 89 000 kg for simulations with freeze thaw however this is not significant since majority of the water and solutes are flushed during wet years in terms of oil sands reclamation success the increased outflow in dry years is important as additional water flowing to the end pit lakes offsets the lake evaporation the increased outflow of salt due to frozen ground during the dry cycle is beneficial because it reduces the potential for evapoconcentration and improves water quality in the low lying wetland areas of the reclaimed landform 4 summary and conclusions this study presents an integrated surface water and groundwater modeling approach to evaluate performance of oil sands mine currently being reclaimed the modeling includes most important hydrological and solute transport processes while maintaining a reasonable balance between inclusion of details of the processes and computational cost and parameterization effort we coupled a physically based three dimensional 3d integrated surface water and groundwater flow and solute transport model with a fully coupled one dimensional 1d heat and water transfer model specifically we included changes to hydraulic conductivity of the near surface materials in the 3d model due to freeze thaw based on the results of the 1d model this approach allows for reasonably simulating effects of frozen ground on infiltration and overland runoff processes the modeling provided estimates of differences in outflow and chloride mass release from the reclaimed landform when simulated with and without frozen ground the model results suggest that outflow from the reclaimed landscape would occur only during wet years annual water balance comparisons for transient simulations with and without coupled heat dynamics is almost identical inclusion of frozen ground leads to increased runoff in wet and dry years however the magnitude of outflow in dry years is comparatively small the 3d representation of ground freeze thaw led to reduced infiltration during spring melt deeper groundwater table in the low lying areas during summer and reduced salt loading during winter chloride mass released from the reclaimed landscape is reduced by 20 over eight year wet climate simulation with frozen ground this reduction is a result of 11 and 78 decrease in summer and winter outflows respectively winter outflow reduction is due to delayed groundwater seepage due to ground frost in wetlands this is consistent with observations of ketcheson et al 2017 and wang 2019 for reclaimed and natural systems respectively spring melt runoff for wet climate model simulation with frozen ground increases by almost 40 as compared to model simulation without frozen ground this simulation result is consistent with observations of ketcheson and price 2016a and biagi and carey 2020 for reclaimed landforms and koren et al 2014 for natural systems together the decrease of outflow in winter and increase of freshwater flow in spring season results in reduction of outflow chloride concentrations by a factor of 1 1 1 6 for the two seasons summer outflow chloride concentrations remain unchanged during the wet cycle however 11 reduction in outflow leads to reduced mass release overall the seasonal partitioning of outflow and salt loading with ground freeze thaw suggests that the effects of frozen ground are significant the increased volume and fresher water quality discharge to the end pit lakes is beneficial for sustainability of end pit lakes during wet and dry cycles including ground freeze thaw in integrated surface and groundwater models is computationally intensive the results of this work suggest that previous models that did not include ground freeze thaw are conservative since water quality is expected to improve with inclusion of ground freeze thaw effects this work would allow decision makers in the oil sands industry to better assess model results and understand the conservatism in outflow and solute mass release results when not including ground freeze thaw the modeling approach developed in this study was able to successfully simulate the differences in water balance and water quality responses within the reclaimed landform at the same time the modeling approach provided a practical modeling framework to incorporate ground freeze thaw and winter hydrological processes without excessively increasing the computational burden of the integrated model the model reasonably captured the landform scale seasonal hydrological responses however it is acknowledged that local scale processes were simplified in order to reduce the parameterization burden for example the 1d coupled heat and water transfer models were developed only for representative upland and wetland lowland in a landform that is made up of several upland hummocks draining to the low lying areas through a series of swales it is possible that ground freeze thaw timing within different hummock uplands is not the same which was not necessarily captured in the modeling described in this paper this can be improved in future studies once more data from the landform is collected the 3d model results suggest that the implications of coupled heat dynamics should be considered when performing detailed evaluation of reclaimed in pit oil sands landforms where detailed evaluation of reclaimed in pit landforms at finer time scales is desired the results also suggest that modeling in pit tailings landforms without freeze thaw provides a conservative estimate of solute release and reasonable water balance on an annual basis which is appropriate for coarse site wide models declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

replicating the landscape and hydrology of the surrounding boreal systems porewater in these materials contain elevated levels of salts and other solutes water quality will govern the success and

chloride transport models with and without ground freezing thawing to compare performance of an in pit oil sands mine currently being reclaimed new hydrological insights for the region transient simulations under wet dry climate cycles suggest that the reclaimed landform will shed water only during wet years annual water balance with and without coupled heat dynamics is identical however the three dimensional representation of ground freeze thaw results in reduced snowmelt infiltration summer groundwater table and solute release during winter the outcome is increased spring runoff 20

canadian boreal plains the oil sands mines reaching end of operations are being progressively reclaimed as per regulations oil sands mines are to be reclaimed to a land capability that is equivalent to pre mining conditions i e locally common boreal ecosystems aer 2018 specifically the reclaimed landforms are expected to provide an equivalent capability to store and transmit water while merging into the surrounding boreal landscape ketcheson et al 2017 nagare et al 2018 biagi et al 2021 water quality and water budget within reclaimed oil sands landscapes need to be evaluated to predict the

smerdon et al 2007 ketcheson et al 2017 given the cold regions climate of oil sands region water and solute cycling is driven by both water and heat dynamics hayashi et al 1998a 1998b devito et al 2012 ketcheson and price 2016a huang et al 2018 biagi and carey 2020 oil sands mine reclamation designs need to incorporate these hydrological characteristics of the boreal regions oil sands mines are being reclaimed using mined out materials e g peat overburden tailings sand that is stockpiled during mining use of these materials presents water quality challenges for revegetation and water discharge from reclaimed landscape for example tailings sand is used to construct in pit tailings landforms and the hydraulically placed sand holds oil sands process affected water ospw which contains elevated levels of salts and other constituents of interest cois understanding mobility of these cois by meteoric water during wet climate cycles and water availability for vegetation and end pit lakes during dry climate cycles is essential for the proper evaluation of reclamation designs kessler et al 2010 ketcheson et al 2016 nagare et al 2018 water recharging on uplands flushes the shallow subsurface materials and discharges salts and cois to low lying areas in reclaimed landscapes a process that mimics the functioning of natural boreal upland wetland systems smerdon et al 2005 2007 kessel et al 2018 nagare et al 2018 such flushing and upward movement of water in unsaturated zone by capillary action can evapoaccumulate salts and cois in root zone and on surface of the wetlands and uplands dobchuk et al 2012 rezanezhad et al 2012 ketcheson et al 2016 simhayov et al 2017 nagare et al 2018 therefore performance evaluations of reclamation designs compare nature of surface water and groundwater interactions location of groundwater table solute flushing mechanisms and water volume and solute mass release rates from the landforms to design criteria and feed the results into the engineering process for design optimization solute cycling within the landform includes advective flushing of the hummocks and diffusive flushing of the underlying fine tailings dobchuk et al 2012 nagare et al 2015a 2018 biagi et al 2019 the groundwater table location governs geotechnical and hydrotechnical stability of the landform nagare et al 2018 it also governs the salinization potential of the root zone of the treed upland vegetation dobchuk et al 2012 nagare et al 2015a 2018 understanding of surface water groundwater interactions flushing of shallow subsurface and salinization potential of the root zone is the main driver for cover soil design research in oil sands reclamation this includes investigations of changes in properties of covers due to freeze thaw thickness

ketcheson and price 2016b numerical models are often used to analyze water and solute cycling within design landscapes dobchuk et al 2012 huang et al 2018 lukenbach et al 2019 nagare et al 2018 there is no consistency of models used to represent constructed systems in the oil sands region as models have been chosen and developed to examine a specific process or operational questions focusing on decoupled overland groundwater flow or inorganic solute transport biagi and carey 2020 furthermore these models are often too simplistic often one or two dimensional and do not comprehensively represent all the hydrological processes e g evapotranspiration frozen ground etc that govern the water and solute cycling in reclaimed landforms biagi and carey 2020 nagare et al 2015a 2018 frozen ground in reclaimed landforms can impede infiltration and increase overland flow during spring melt ketcheson and price 2016a ground frost in wetland can delay groundwater outflow ketcheson et al 2017 and snowmelt rate and partitioning can govern the timing of combined runoff from a reclaimed oil sands landform biagi and carey 2020 these processes can lead to increased freshwater outflow from reclaimed landforms a process critical to sustainability water quality and quantity of downstream end pit lakes despite of its critical importance ground freeze thaw is rarely incorporated in analysis of hydrology of reclaimed oil sands landforms biagi and carey 2020 given the tightly coupled surface water and groundwater processes in boreal settings integrated surface water and groundwater flow and solute transport modeling is well suited to evaluate post closure landscape performance smerdon et al 2005 2007 price et al 2010 carrera hernández et al 2011 nagare et al 2015a 2018 there are not many examples of integrated modeling let alone with ground freeze thaw to support oil sands mine reclamation designs integrated models have the capability to simulate coupled water and heat dynamics schilling et al 2019 but such simulations may come at an increased computational cost and effort to parameterize the model huang et al 2018 it is therefore important to strike a balance in inclusion of details of processes while using integrated models to support evaluation of reclaimed landforms in this study we demonstrate the combined use of a three dimensional 3d integrated flow and solute transport model and a one dimensional 1d coupled flow and heat transport model to analyze water and solute dynamics with frozen ground processes in an in pit oil sands mine currently under reclamation the reclaimed mine consists of coarse sand tailings hummocks draining into low lying flatter areas similar to the general boreal setting of treed uplands surrounded by organic wetlands the objective of the study was to develop a practical coupled water heat and chloride transport modeling approach using physically based integrated models to support oil sands mine reclamation the 3d modeling included the most important hydrological and solute transport processes e g surface atmosphere interactions snowmelt rate and timing frozen ground processes unsaturated zone processes and overland subsurface flow and transport coupling the 1d and 3d models ensured striking a reasonable balance between inclusion of details of processes and computational burden and parameterization effort specifically we investigated the effect of frozen ground on spring melt runoff rate timing and outflow water quality changes to seasonal groundwater table location and annual water and solute balances when frozen ground processes are included and excluded from the model there is limited direct data from the reclaimed landform to confirm the model performance data from other compatible reclaimed and natural sites was used to validate the model performance the modeling results are being used as a guide to optimize reclamation processes and to develop monitoring plans once the landform is fully reclaimed 2 methods 2 1 study case example the reclaimed mine pit site is an in pit mine currently being reclaimed by syncrude canada ltd syncrude syncrude mine site is located 40 km north of fort mcmurray alberta canada the study area is shown in fig 1 the area of the reclaimed watershed modeled in this study is 8 4 km2 the reclamation design was completed over multiple years in the past decade the mine pit was backfilled with a mixture of fluid fine tailings and sand tailings together called composite tailings or ct to create upland wetland systems typical of coarse textured natural systems in the boreal forests the ct filled pit is being covered with a series of upland sand hummocks fig 2 the area between hummocks form swales valleys and the hummock swale system is sloped towards a flat low lying area connected to the landform outlet at closure the outlet of the reclaimed landform will be connected to an end pit lake by a surface closure channel the hummocks and the low lying area are being covered with soil covers to promote vegetation growth at reclamation the elevated sand tailings hummocks will support treed vegetation and drain into the low lying wetland areas the low lying area is intended to evolve into a wetland supporting native wetland vegetation species the soil covers comprise of an upper layer of salvaged peat overlying a layer of salvaged glacial clay soil dobchuk et al 2012 nagare et al 2018 as already introduced the tailings sands and ct are constructed primarily by hydraulically transporting in ospw and therefore contain elevated levels of saline pore fluid at their placement the model layers bottom to top consist of thick composite tailings that filled the pit at end of mining the ct is covered by a minimum 1 m thick tailings sand cover throughout the model domain the tailings sand cover is overlain by tailings sand hummocks 1 10 m thick in areas where uplands were constructed the sand hummocks uplands and minimum 1 m thick tailings sand cover low lying areas is covered with surficial vegetation cover soil layer made up of 0 25 m peat overlying a glacial till layer of the same thickness the base of the mine pit was excavated into mcmurray formation which is a bitumen filled low permeability geological unit therefore no significant subsurface fluxes are expected to leave the reclaimed landform through the mcmurray formation subsurface water transfer will be limited to the shallow subsurface through the tailings sand hummocks water input to the landform will be from rain and snow and water transfer out of the landform will be by evapotranspiration et and overland flow at the landform outlet flowing into the closure drainage channel the et is controlled by the vegetation distribution over the landform the study was limited to early reclamation timeline first 10 years after reclamation the uplands hummocks were assumed to be vegetated by treed species and the swales and low lying areas by shrubs and wetland species the vegetation is still being planned but based on previous reclamation efforts of nearby landforms uplands are likely to be vegetated with trembling aspen populus tremuloides michx and white spruce picea glauca moench voss kessler et al 2010 huang et al 2018 and wetlands with carex aquatilis sedges arrow grasses rushes and slough grass ketcheson et al 2016 nicholls et al 2016 vitt et al 2016 the precipitation is assumed to be equally distributed over the entire landform i e no spatial variation water can flow out of the landform only when the water depth in the low lying wetland areas exceeds the outlet elevation the water depth in the wetland areas is determined by the interactions between the different principal components of the water budget of the landform precipitation inputs to the landform will be partitioned into et overland runoff and net percolation in hummock and swale areas recharge net percolation is expected to result in flushing of the upper portion of the hummocks prior to seeping into adjacent swales and low lying wetland areas where it mixes with overland flow nagare et al 2018 2 2 modeling methods hydrogeosphere aquanty 2015 was used for the 3d coupled water and solute modeling hydrogeosphere is a fully coupled surface water and groundwater flow solute and heat transport model hydrogeosphere is also capable of modeling ground freeze thaw processes schilling et al 2019 a detailed description of hydrogeosphere and its capabilities can be found in aquanty 2015 brunner and simmons 2011 maxwell et al 2014 and schilling et al 2019 triangular prism elements of different sizes were used to construct the 3d model grid each model slice in the surface and subsurface domains was discretized using 78 271 nodes and 155 640 triangular elements of different sizes the typical hummock widths in the landform are between 150 m and 400 m while the lengths are between 500 m and 1250 m the typical element side length node spacing of 20 m or smaller was used to construct the grid the model was discretized into 13 subsurface numerical layers of varying thicknesses thus the model grid consisted of 78 271 nodes and 155 640 triangular elements in the surface domain and 1 095 794 nodes and 2 023 320 triangular prisms in the subsurface domain the surface and subsurface domains were separated by a coupling length of 0 001 m model topography was based on lidar data model bottom elevation was based on surveyed mine bottom elevations the bottom of the cover soil was determined by assuming a uniform 0 5 m thickness for the layer the bottom of the tailings sand cap i e top of ct layer in the upland areas was based on the topographic survey conducted after the pit was filled with ct the top of the ct layer rises to the level of the surrounding natural ground around the mine pit time varying fluxes to represent precipitation and potential evapotranspiration boundary conditions were applied to the entire top of the model critical depth boundary condition was applied at the top boundary nodes corresponding to the watershed outlets to allow outflow when surface water depth exceeds ground elevation at these locations elsewhere a zero gradient boundary condition was used in both the surface and subsurface domains details of mathematical description of the boundary conditions can be found in aquanty 2015 model parameters are summarized in table 1 the ct layer was subdivided into upper and lower ct materials based on sand to fines ratios determined from cone penetration tests other model parameters are based on laboratory and field investigations completed by syncrude over the years and literature values mckenna 2002 shurniak and barbour 2002 nagare et al 2015a 2018 huang et al 2018 lukenbach et al 2019 biagi and carey 2020 biagi et al 2021 the climatic dataset used in the model is primarily based on 1944 2020 precipitation and air temperature measured at environment canada s fort mcmurray airport weather station the long term average annual precipitation at the station is 427 mm the average calculated annual potential evapotranspiration for 1944 2019 period is 578 mm the climate data shows multiple cycles of wet and dry periods longest of which occur from 1966 to 1978 wet cycle and 2006 2017 dry cycle the recorded average annual precipitation over the wet and the dry cycles is 504 mm and 357 mm respectively these two periods were used to model eight wet cycle and seven dry cycle years period following reclamation assumed to be at end of year 2019 this climate input captures the highest wet and lowest dry precipitation on a decadal annual and daily basis therefore the probability of occurrence of the estimated conditions is near a 100 year average recurrence interval i e considered to have a 1 chance of occurring each year the wet and dry climate cycle simulations were conducted with and without frozen ground processes the model flow initial conditions were developed by transient model spin up using 2005 2019 climate input chloride transport was modeled assuming a full strength chloride concentration throughout the reclaimed landscape based on syncrude s tailings water quality data we used a hybrid approach to model the coupled water solute and heat dynamics for this study hydrogeosphere is capable of simulating fully coupled water solute and heat transfer with ground freezing and thawing if ground surface temperatures are available to be used as a boundary condition schilling et al 2019 modeling ground freeze thaw explicitly in hydrogeosphere along with integrated surface water and groundwater flow and solute transport although possible would have made the modeling computationally excessively expensive therefore we used shaw flerchinger and saxton 1989 a one dimensional 1d fully coupled water and heat transfer code to model the ground temperatures with freezing and thawing we developed 1d models for upland and wetland conditions and calibrated the models to ground temperatures measured over two years at syncrude s nearby reclamation research plot with equivalent reclamation conditions the 1d shaw modeling was conducted for 5 m long soil columns the domain was discretized into 50 nodes a 1 mm node spacing near the ground surface was gradually increased to 50 cm at the base of the column ground freezing and thawing reduces the effective hydraulic conductivity of the active layer seasonally freezing and thawing zone andersland and anderson 1978 the frost depth varies over different years depending on antecedent moisture conditions and winter air temperature we used the daily air temperatures from fort mcmurray weather station over the modeling durations described above to model ground temperatures the shaw model results are used to determine the frost depth ice saturation and resultant effective hydraulic conductivity of the frozen zones during freezing and thawing periods the water potential in frozen soil ψ l in j kg where liquid water and ice coexist can be calculated from the absolute temperature t in k using the generalized form of the clapeyron equation flerchinger and saxton 1989 spaans and baker 1996 nagare et al 2015b 1 d ψ l λ t dt d ψ i where ψ i j kg is the ice potential and λ kj kg is the latent heat of fusion of water being approximated as a function of t as 2 λ t 712 38 5 545 t 6 28 10 3 t 2 when the gauge pressure is assumed to be zero in the ice phase the liquid potential can be calculated as 3 ψ l 712 38 ln t t 0 5 54 t t 0 3 14 10 3 t 2 t 0 2 the soil retention relation where relative permeability is a function of water potential can then be used to determine the effective hydraulic conductivity the hydraulic conductivity reduction due to the existence of ice or the reduction factor is used to scale the saturated hydraulic conductivity as a function of time for the 3d hydrogeosphere simulations during freezing and thawing periods it is noted that the transient depth of freezing and thawing zones and the hydraulic conductivity reduction factors are used in the 3d simulations as a proxy to ground freezing and thawing thus hydraulic conductivity of the layers experiencing freezing and thawing is equivalent to the 1d shaw model results in frozen zones and is internally calculated in the 3d model based on moisture content when where layers are frost free the above methodology is similar to the approaches used in langford et al 2020 and nagare et al 2021 to model coupled water and heat transport this approach allows a reasonable physically based representation of water and solute exchanges between the surface water and groundwater while overcoming the computational limitation of explicitly modeling water solute and heat transfer with freeze thaw in large 3d models 3 results and discussions 3 1 shaw modeling the 1d shaw model was first verified by comparing the simulated and observed ground temperatures for two years 2017 2018 of reported data at two syncrude research sites during the two year period the air temperature at the research sites ranged from 30 30 c with below zero being maintained for about 5 months in the winter fig 3a precipitation was more concentrated in the summer in 2018 while it was distributed more evenly over the year in 2017 fig 3b fig 3c illustrates that the temperature measured at 65 cm below ground surface was similar at the two locations and the simulated temperature could reasonably reproduce the measured ground temperatures the time depth temperature results shown in fig 3d clearly indicate that the vertical temperature profiles are strongly influenced by the material distributions at the site especially at shallow depth where the moisture content is more responsive to the recharge events precipitation and snowmelt the results also show that freezing front remains mostly in the shallow cover soil zone peat mineral mix and till layers during most of the winter season freezing front penetrates below 50 cm into the tailings sand in late winter fig 3d overall the results indicate that the 1d water heat model appears to be an effective alternative to a more comprehensive but computationally demanding 3d models to approximate shallow hydrothermal conditions in the study area the 1d shaw model was used to analyze the hydrothermal interactions near surface under dry and wet climate conditions at the reclamation site fig 4 average daily temperatures over the first 10 years of dry and wet climate cycles show that in the wet cycle it is slightly cooler but frost depth becomes shallower with increased precipitation and wetter ground conditions due to the latent heat effects fig 4 frost depth is generally deeper in the uplands compared to the wetter lowland area due to latent heat effects fig 4e f fig 5 shows the hydraulic conductivity reduction factors at three different depths in typical dry and wet years calculated using the simulated temperature and eq 3 along with the soil retention relation the results in fig 5 indicate that the hydraulic conductivity can be significantly reduced in shallow subsurface during the winter months limiting the hydrologic interactions between surface and subsurface 3 2 hydrogeosphere model verification a full model calibration of the 3d hydrogeosphere was not possible as the in pit landform is not yet fully built and long term monitoring dataset is not available therefore the model performance was verified for available data from within the partially built landform and based on data from regional natural and reclaimed watersheds groundwater elevations in a research plot twerdy 2019 and other areas within the partially built landform are available for a limited time period the measured and simulated groundwater table elevations matched within 2 m for the period of measurements seepage flux measurements from toe drains within the dykes of the partially built landform were also available the modeled seepage rate of 6 4 l s agrees reasonably with the measured seepage rate of 5 3 l s measured actual evapotranspiration aet data from an adjoining reclaimed overburden dump is available for 2003 2015 period huang et al 2018 the two landforms are different in characteristics and therefore not directly comparable the modeled aet for 2010 2015 period of 354 400 mm is fairly comparable to the measured 370 450 mm range with a mean absolute and root mean squared errors of 24 mm and 27 mm respectively 3 3 three dimensional coupled water solute and heat simulations the 3d coupled water flow and chloride transport simulations with and without ground freeze thaw were compared based on annual and seasonal water and chloride mass release at the landform outlet and timing of runoff generation 3 3 1 water outflow the modeled outflow is reported as depth in mm over the area of the reclaimed watershed which can be compared easily relative to the precipitation the model results for the wet climate cycle figs 6a and 7a suggest that annual runoff depths are 10 mm smaller 6 decrease to 28 mm greater 67 increase for simulations with frozen ground than without frozen ground the average increase in runoff over the eight years of the wet cycle is 4 mm the total runoff over the eight years is 36 mm greater 5 increase when the simulations include frozen ground for the dry climate cycle figs 6b and 7b the model results suggest that frozen ground conditions lead to an increased runoff for each year 0 11 mm increase although the runoff magnitude is much smaller than the wet cycle the total runoff over the seven year dry cycle simulation is more than three times higher with ground freezing 47 mm vs 14 mm overall the model results suggest that the difference in annual water balance is not significant with and without heat dynamics this is similar to the findings of huang et al 2018 it is noted however that annual runoff alone may not provide a complete picture of the effects of frozen ground on oil sands mine reclamation figs 6 7 and 8 clearly demonstrate the effects of frozen ground on seasonal distribution of outflow for each year of the wet and dry climate cycles the runoff increases during spring melt season while decreasing over winter and summer seasons when ground freezing and thawing is included in the model simulations for the eight years of the wet cycle the winter and summer runoffs decrease by 78 and 11 respectively while the spring melt runoff increases by 40 fig 7a for the dry climate cycle the outflow is distributed 18 46 and 36 over winter spring melt and summer seasons when modeled without ground freezing and thawing with ground freeze thaw included in the model simulations 92 of the outflow takes place during the spring season the seasonal changes to outflow due to ground freezing and thawing over eight and seven years of wet and dry climate cycles are summarized in table 2 this redistribution of outflow from the reclaimed landscape has implications for solute mass release this information is critical for decision makers to consider because water quality is the primary criteria for the success of oil sands mine reclamation and site closure the reduction in outflow during the winter season is attributed to decrease in groundwater discharge baseflow due to freezing of surface in swales and low lying areas this is consistent with observations in natural systems e g wang 2019 and in reclaimed wetlands e g ketcheson et al 2017 the reduction in summer outflow is accounted for by relatively deeper groundwater table in the low lying areas during the summer months i e relatively increased infiltration in summer this occurs because without ground freeze thaw a substantial amount of spring melt infiltrates the ground in the wetland areas and leads to increase in groundwater table this leads to increased groundwater discharge and increased outflow during summer precipitation events when frozen ground is incorporated in the model relatively increased portion of spring melt is converted into overland flow while reducing the amount of infiltration this results in deeper groundwater table in the low lying areas at the end of spring consequently more water infiltrates the ground in summer reducing the amount of outflow this is consistent with observations in natural systems fig 9 koren et al 2014 and in reclaimed landforms e g ketcheson and price 2016a biagi and carey 2020 3 3 2 solute mass release salt is a constituent of interest for reclamation planners in alberta s oil sands region long term effects of salinity on vegetation growth and end pit lake water quality sustainability are currently being studied this study is part of advancing the knowledge on quantifying salt release from reclaimed landforms chloride was used as a proxy for salt concentrations in the water cycling within the landform and in the outflow from the landform the model results suggest that there is approximately a 20 reduction in chloride mass release over the wet cycle when ground freezing effects are considered figs 10a and 11a the reduction in chloride mass release is a direct result of decreased baseflow in winter increased spring melt runoff and decreased outflow in summer the decrease in winter baseflow and summer outflow results into reduced chloride transfer from uplands to lowlands in simulations with ground freezing and thawing this is critical since this improves the water quality for wetland vegetation the 20 reduction in eight wet years is a significant reduction in solute load to the end pit lake in addition the end pit lakes receive fresher water in spring melt season the spring melt outflow chloride concentrations for simulations with freeze thaw reduce by a factor of 1 1 1 6 fig 12 over the eight years when compared to simulations without freeze thaw the summer outflow chloride concentrations remain unchanged but 11 lesser outflow results into reduced chloride mass release this is an important insight towards assessing the sustainability of the end pit lakes and overall success of oil sands mine reclamation the chloride mass release during the dry cycle is generally an order of magnitude smaller than the mass release during the wet cycle figs 10b and 11b primarily due to the reduced runoff fig 6b as discussed above the outflow increases during the dry cycle when frozen ground is included in the simulations 47 mm vs 14 mm this is primarily due to the increased spring melt contribution the spring melt outflow concentrations for simulations with freeze thaw reduce by a factor of 1 1 1 7 over the seven years when compared to simulations without freeze thaw the total chloride mass release over the seven year dry cycle simulation increases by 2 3 times 208 000 kg vs 89 000 kg for simulations with freeze thaw however this is not significant since majority of the water and solutes are flushed during wet years in terms of oil sands reclamation success the increased outflow in dry years is important as additional water flowing to the end pit lakes offsets the lake evaporation the increased outflow of salt due to frozen ground during the dry cycle is beneficial because it reduces the potential for evapoconcentration and improves water quality in the low lying wetland areas of the reclaimed landform 4 summary and conclusions this study presents an integrated surface water and groundwater modeling approach to evaluate performance of oil sands mine currently being reclaimed the modeling includes most important hydrological and solute transport processes while maintaining a reasonable balance between inclusion of details of the processes and computational cost and parameterization effort we coupled a physically based three dimensional 3d integrated surface water and groundwater flow and solute transport model with a fully coupled one dimensional 1d heat and water transfer model specifically we included changes to hydraulic conductivity of the near surface materials in the 3d model due to freeze thaw based on the results of the 1d model this approach allows for reasonably simulating effects of frozen ground on infiltration and overland runoff processes the modeling provided estimates of differences in outflow and chloride mass release from the reclaimed landform when simulated with and without frozen ground the model results suggest that outflow from the reclaimed landscape would occur only during wet years annual water balance comparisons for transient simulations with and without coupled heat dynamics is almost identical inclusion of frozen ground leads to increased runoff in wet and dry years however the magnitude of outflow in dry years is comparatively small the 3d representation of ground freeze thaw led to reduced infiltration during spring melt deeper groundwater table in the low lying areas during summer and reduced salt loading during winter chloride mass released from the reclaimed landscape is reduced by 20 over eight year wet climate simulation with frozen ground this reduction is a result of 11 and 78 decrease in summer and winter outflows respectively winter outflow reduction is due to delayed groundwater seepage due to ground frost in wetlands this is consistent with observations of ketcheson et al 2017 and wang 2019 for reclaimed and natural systems respectively spring melt runoff for wet climate model simulation with frozen ground increases by almost 40 as compared to model simulation without frozen ground this simulation result is consistent with observations of ketcheson and price 2016a and biagi and carey 2020 for reclaimed landforms and koren et al 2014 for natural systems together the decrease of outflow in winter and increase of freshwater flow in spring season results in reduction of outflow chloride concentrations by a factor of 1 1 1 6 for the two seasons summer outflow chloride concentrations remain unchanged during the wet cycle however 11 reduction in outflow leads to reduced mass release overall the seasonal partitioning of outflow and salt loading with ground freeze thaw suggests that the effects of frozen ground are significant the increased volume and fresher water quality discharge to the end pit lakes is beneficial for sustainability of end pit lakes during wet and dry cycles including ground freeze thaw in integrated surface and groundwater models is computationally intensive the results of this work suggest that previous models that did not include ground freeze thaw are conservative since water quality is expected to improve with inclusion of ground freeze thaw effects this work would allow decision makers in the oil sands industry to better assess model results and understand the conservatism in outflow and solute mass release results when not including ground freeze thaw the modeling approach developed in this study was able to successfully simulate the differences in water balance and water quality responses within the reclaimed landform at the same time the modeling approach provided a practical modeling framework to incorporate ground freeze thaw and winter hydrological processes without excessively increasing the computational burden of the integrated model the model reasonably captured the landform scale seasonal hydrological responses however it is acknowledged that local scale processes were simplified in order to reduce the parameterization burden for example the 1d coupled heat and water transfer models were developed only for representative upland and wetland lowland in a landform that is made up of several upland hummocks draining to the low lying areas through a series of swales it is possible that ground freeze thaw timing within different hummock uplands is not the same which was not necessarily captured in the modeling described in this paper this can be improved in future studies once more data from the landform is collected the 3d model results suggest that the implications of coupled heat dynamics should be considered when performing detailed evaluation of reclaimed in pit oil sands landforms where detailed evaluation of reclaimed in pit landforms at finer time scales is desired the results also suggest that modeling in pit tailings landforms without freeze thaw provides a conservative estimate of solute release and reasonable water balance on an annual basis which is appropriate for coarse site wide models declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
8064,study region gordon gulch an upper montane forest watershed in the colorado front range study focus as the climate warms the fraction of precipitation falling as snow is expected to decrease and the timing of snowmelt is expected to shift earlier in spring in snow dominated regions these changes in snow accumulation and melt prompt us to examine downstream changes in streamflow the objective of this study is to understand how changes in precipitation phase and snowmelt timing alter the timing of surface water inputs i e rainfall and snowmelt and the partitioning of these inputs between evapotranspiration and streamflow we used the distributed hydrology soil vegetation model and weather research and forecasting model based projections of future climatic conditions to simulate streamflow new hydrological insights for the region modeled annual streamflow decreased by 22 for the period 2071 2100 surface water inputs increased during winter when atmospheric water demand was relatively low subsequently the winter period partitioning of water as rain or snowmelt to streamflow as opposed to evapotranspiration increased by 15 while partitioning to evapotranspiration decreased effectively buffering what would have otherwise been a larger net streamflow decline associated with warming seasonal streamflow buffering is unique to snow influenced systems as the magnitude and timing of water released from snowpacks is sensitive to warming this effect may diminish as warming drives snow influenced systems toward rain dominance with implications for hydrological and ecological processes and water resource management keywords water snowmelt streamflow modeling hydroclimatology budyko 1 introduction a warming climate is a catalyst for hydrologic change in the mountains altering seasonal water availability by changing the phase of precipitation p from snow to rain and the timing of snowmelt sturm et al 2010 williams et al 2009 less snowfall shallower snowpack and changes in the timing and magnitude of melt mote et al 2018 musselman et al 2017 will alter surface water inputs and the associated partitioning of surface water between evapotranspiration et and streamflow q overall impacts of climate warming on hydrology have been empirically investigated and modeled but leave a need to examine individual mechanistic causes to sensitivities in streamflow berghuijs et al 2014 foster et al 2016 gupta and soroosh 1998 hinckley et al 2012 kapnick et al 2018 livneh and badger 2020 safeeq et al 2013 an unanswered question in cold region mountain hydrology is how warming may modify the timing of water input to the terrestrial system we posit that a critical component of hydrologic sensitivity to climate change due to changes in snowfall and snowmelt arises from changes in the timing of water delivery to the terrestrial system broadly defined as the land surface beneath a snowpack in this context we define surface water inputs swi as rainfall on the land surface and snowmelt water leaving the base of the snowpack swi is thus the sum of liquid water available to the terrestrial system at a given time which can then be partitioned to streamflow q or evapotranspiration et or enter the subsurface as storage brooks et al 2015 kiewiet et al 2021 kormos et al 2014 hence as the temporal dynamics of either rainfall or snowmelt change with warming a change in the alignment of swi and potential evaporation pet will occur kormos et al 2014 in the upper montane forest of the colorado front range periods of high swi align with periods of mid to high potential evapotranspiration pet kormos et al 2014 precipitation falls as snow during wintertime months and snow water equivalent swe accumulation stores water until the snowpack melts creating a lag in the timing between snowfall and swi generation the snowmelt period produces a large sustained pulse of swi in the spring months a time of increased pet barnett et al 2005 brooks et al 2015 kampf and lefsky 2016 kormos et al 2014 luce et al 1998 marks et al 1998 milly and dunne 2016 scheff and frierson 2014 sturm et al 2010 unlike the higher alpine areas of colorado mountainous regions snow accumulation in the montane area studied here is more spatially variable as a result snowmelt is not as spatially uniform or as consistent in time as it is in higher elevation areas we hypothesize that within an end of current century warmer climate scenario the seasonality of catchment swi and catchment pet may become misaligned with unknown effects on seasonal streamflow under warmer temperatures swe accumulation will likely be lower and less persistent throughout the winter reducing or eliminating the large spring melt pulse barnhart et al 2016 cayan et al 2001 knowles et al 2005 kormos et al 2014 musselman et al 2017 rasmussen et al 2014 regonda and rajagopalan 2004 as snowfall shifts to rainfall and as snowmelt shifts earlier swi will shift earlier in the year during a time of decreased atmospheric water demand i e pet previous works have evaluated streamflow sensitivity to climate e g tennant et al 2015 but have not identified mechanistically the role of changes in the timing of swi with regard to streamflow production on annual to monthly time scales to address this knowledge gap we applied the distributed hydrology soil vegetation model dhsvm to simulate streamflow under historical conditions and a warmer climate scenario informed by high resolution weather and climate model runs liu et al 2017 dhsvm was forced with historical metrological data from in catchment and nearby weather stations whenever available and weather research forecast wrf model output to impose warming conditions we isolated model states and fluxes to estimate how warming driven changes in the timing of modeled swi influence catchment streamflow analyses specifically included correlations and evaluation of delta values i e the differences in annual and seasonal swi et and q across model simulations when compared against historical conditions previous modeling studies have reported net decreases in modeled annual streamflow and net increases in annual pet associated with climate warming adam et al 2009 anghileri et al 2016 clow 2010 mahanama et al 2012 siddique and palmer 2021 tang and lettenmaier 2012 other modeling studies have predicted future increases in wintertime streamflow siddique et al 2021a b despite overall annual decreases mahanama et al 2012 siddique et al 2020 2021a b and shifts in peak streamflow timing tennant et al 2015 yet the mechanism driving the increase in seasonal winter streamflow and its effect on annual hydrologic partitioning remains to be defined and evaluated we predict that the timing of swi may change monthly water balance partitioning providing a much needed explanation to previous partitioning analyses berghuijs et al 2014 kormos et al 2014 to explore potential changes in partitioning we analyzed dhsvm model output in the context of the budyko hypothesis budyko 1974 a framework that predicts partitioning of incoming water between streamflow or evapotranspiration based on an index of aridity pet p the following question is addressed how does climate warming and subsequent changes in the timing of swi affect monthly and annual streamflow generation and water partitioning within a continental upper montane catchment we hypothesized that an increase in rainfall and earlier snowmelt events induced by warming would temporally decouple catchment water availability i e swi and atmospheric water demand i e pet and thus will increase cold season hydrologic partitioning to streamflow understanding a potential mechanism to changes in annual and seasonal water availability would allow for more accurate water management planning as the climate continues to warm mote et al 2018 the novelty of this study is the model based quantification of the decoupling of swi and pet which isolates swi as a potential driver of hydrologic change evaluated through the seasonal changes in modeled winter and early spring streamflow that potentially offset overall reductions in modeled annual streamflow 2 study area and methods we conducted this research in the gordon gulch catchment which is located within the upper montane forest marr 1961 of the front range colorado usa 40

within the watershed scale hydrologic model we used the budyko framework barnhart et al 2016 budyko 1974 gerrits et al 2009 muleta and nicklow 2005 wang and tang 2014 to compare differences in modeled

watershed within the boulder creek critical zone observatory bcczo 16 km west of boulder colorado this site was selected for its inclusion in the boulder creek critical zone observatory network where it represents one of few locations where local snow instrumentation a necessity to this analysis exists in an upper montane climatic zone as opposed to strictly in sub alpine and alpine elevations many other works in this climatic zone use remotely sensed or data or model output to gain snow information e g rice et al 2011 kelly and goulden 2016 klos et al 2014 mainali et al 2015 focusing on snow and its temporal release into the terrestrial system in the upper montane forest is important because the winter season temperatures in this area remain close to 0 c jennings et al 2018 the snowpack often melts intermittently kormos et al 2014 and is susceptible to small changes in atmospheric conditions including warming and shifts in precipitation magnitude and phase williams et al 2009 further the environmental characteristics and thus hydrologic behavior of gordon gulch is on average reflective of the behavior in the surrounding upper montane forests in the colorado front range anderson et al 2021 as seen by its critical zone architecture which includes soil mobile regolith saprolite and weathered rock gordon gulch is located within the semi arid upper montane forest fig 1 and has a catchment area of 2 6 km2 an average elevation of 2500 m and an elevation range of 2446 m to 2737 m the watershed is drained by the eastward flowing gordon gulch stream with opposing north south aspect hillslopes anderson et al 2021 diek et al 2014 gordon gulch experiences seasonal mean temperature differences of 20 c with a yearly mean temperature of 5 1 c annual average precipitation is 520 mm 40 60 of which falls as snow anderson et al 2021 anderson and ragar 2020a b c burns et al 2016 cowie 2010 annual runoff ratios range between 0 08 and 0 23 anderson and ragar 2020a b c barry 1973 befus et al 2011 diek et al 2014 hinckley et al 2012 gordon gulch is underlain by gneiss bedrock on which a thin residual soil is developed anderson et al 2021 soil ranges from 0 m to 0 4 m in thickness anderson et al 2021 shea 2013 and seismic refraction profiling shows that reduced seismic velocities corresponding to weathered rock extends to 8 12 m depth across the catchment anderson et al 2021 befus et al 2011 the catchment is dotted with tors i e bedrock outcrops which comprise about 10 of the surface anderson et al 2021 model forcing and validation data were obtained from a collection of local meteorology stations and spatially gridded data described below and listed in table 1 and a streamflow gage within the catchment anderson and ragar 2020a b c 2 2 methods distributed hydrology soil vegetation model dhsvm dhsvm is a spatially distributed numerical model that uses meteorological forcings and physiographic data to simulate the effects of precipitation soils geology and vegetation on the hydrologic response at the catchment scale wigmosta et al 1994 dhsvm has been used to successfully portray mountainous watershed and sub watershed processes across north america and to investigate the effects of climate warming and vegetation change on streamflow amount and timing livneh et al 2014 2015 raleigh et al 2016 westrick et al 2002 wigmosta and lettenmaier 1999 yao and yang 2009 at each time interval the model solves energy and water balance equations for every grid cell in the select watershed wigmosta et al 1994 using model forcings i e precipitation air temperature wind speed incident shortwave radiation relative humidity and net radiation components and state variables e g topographic vegetation and soil characteristics model outputs include the primary hydrologic fluxes such as evapotranspiration and streamflow a two layer canopy represents evapotranspiration et and energy transfer at each timestep a two layer snow model solves for the snowpack energy and mass balance e g snow accumulation and melt a multilayer unsaturated soil model and a saturated subsurface flow model simulate subsurface water flow dynamics pet is calculated using the penman monteith approach slope and aspect are accounted for in dhsvm by the characterization of shortwave and longwave radiation within the surface energy budget wigmosta et al 1994 the soil vegetation water balance in dhsvm accounts for rooting zone water storage overstory and understory interception evaporation and transpiration surface soil evaporation snowpack water content and volume of precipitation wigmosta et al 1994 dhsvm simulates the exchange of water between grid cells resulting in a three dimensional redistribution of surface and subsurface water across the landscape wigmosta et al 1994 dhsvm moves water between grid cells as overland flow channel flow and or shallow subsurface flow in the soil the subsurface water storage in the soil is a function of soil depth and depth to the root zones in each soil layer where increased soil depth allows for increased storage mcnamara et al 2005 all through fall water or snowmelt that which is not intercepted enters the soil column and becomes subsurface storage through unsaturated moisture movement once the soil becomes saturated excess water becomes surface runoff thus soil vegetation water balance within one grid cell is defined as see fig 2 in wigmosta et al 1994 1 δ s s 1 δ s s 2 δ s s 3 δ s io δ s iu δ w p e io e iu e s e to e tu p 2 where δ s s 1 and δ s s 2 and δ s s 3 are the changes in the three rooting zones soil water storage respectively δ s io is the change in overstory interception and δ s iu is the change in understory interception δ w is the change in snowpack water content p is the volume of precipitation rain and or snow p2 is the discharge volume leaving the lowest rooting zone e s is the volume of surface soil evaporation and e io e iu e to and e tu are the volumes of overstory and understory evaporation from interception storage and transpiration respectively via darcy s law using the brooks corey eq 1 water percolates through the root zones one defined root zone per soil layer until discharge from the lower rooting zone recharges the local grid cell specific water table wigmosta et al 1994 zhao et al 2009 each grid cell then exchanges saturated water with its eight adjacent neighbors see fig 4 in wigmosta et al 1994 on subsurface flow routing 2 q v θ ks θ θ r ϕ θ r 2 m 3 where q ν is the percolation term ks is the soil vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity ϕ is the soil porosity θr is the residual soil moisture content and m is the pore size distribution index soil transmissivity is calculated assuming that soil lateral saturated hydraulic conductivity decreases exponentially with depth finally dhsvm was modified to partition precipitation phase based on the probability of rain or snow at a given time step using a bivariate binary logistic regression jennings et al 2018 wigmosta and perkins 2001 zhao et al 2009 two dhsvm simulations were run at a 20 m resolution on an hourly timestep a historic control simulation from april 1 2010 to august 31 2013 with a 10 year spin up period and a warming simulation representing an end of current century 2070 2100 climate see section 2 4 2 3 data sources 2 3 1 meteorological variables the sources of model input data are listed in table 1 and include a fusion of in situ measurements from within catchment stations and nearby stations and meteorological reanalyses from the national land data assimilation system nldas2 homer et al 2015 mitchell et al 2004 the purpose of blending these datasets was to build a complete record for the study period across water years 2000 2013 which included a 10 year spin up period from 2000 to 2009 to generate a complete precipitation record we prioritized the most direct measurements within the gordon gulch catchment whenever available in catchment meteorological stations included the gordon gulch north facing meteorological station ggl nf met and the gordon gulch south facing meteorological station ggl sf met during instances when the in catchment measurements were not available nearby meteorological stations were secondarily prioritized which included the national atmospheric deposition program nadp co94 site 2 km south of gordon gulch elevation of 2390 m and the betasso preserve meteorological station bt met 10 2 km east elevation of 2000 m and niwot ridge c1 meteorological station 6 5 km west elevation of 3022 m the order in which these different meteorological stations were prioritized to create a complete precipitation record is outlined in table 1 the nldas2 dataset was prioritized when any remaining gaps in the meteorological record remained with the exception of precipitation the nldas2 record contains a complete record of all required meteorological model input variables air temperature wind speed incident shortwave radiation relative humidity and longwave radiation and were downscaled from 12 km to 20 m resolution using nearest neighbor interpolation the nldas2 meteorological record for these variables was bias corrected using the in catchment and nearby meteorology stations the bias correction process included calculating hourly averages of meteorological station observations which were at a 10 min temporal resolution finding all instances when meteorological station and nldas2 data were both available fitting a linear model through nldas2 data vs meteorological station data using linear model parameters to approximate station observations in gordon gulch from nldas2 record the order in which different meteorological stations were prioritized to bias correct the nldas2 record to create a complete meteorological record except precipitation is outlined in table 1 2 3 2 streamflow there is one streamflow gage in gordon gulch on the eastern end of the catchment fig 1 streamflow stage is recorded and streamflow observations in m3 s are derived from existing annual stage discharge relationships anderson and ragar 2020a b c data are available at 10 min intervals and were aggregated to an hourly time series for use in dhsvm 2 3 3 vegetation soil and geology vegetation and soil types were obtained at 30 m resolution from the national land cover database https www mrlc gov data f 5b0 5d category 3aland 20cover accessed june 2017 and natural resources conservation services https www nrcs usda gov wps portal nrcs detail soils survey geo cid nrcseprd1464625 accessed june 2017 respectively the dominant vegetation types in gordon gulch are evergreen forest and shrubs the dominant soil type is sandy loam shea 2013 spatially distributed geology data for the area is available at a 30 m resolution from the usgs the underlying catchment geology includes biotite and felsic gneiss and granite granitoid diabase quartz latite anderson et al 2021 within dhsvm these were categorized as metasedimentary and metavolcanics rocks and intrusive igneous respectively the mobile regolith bedrock interface is located above the water table in gordon gulch the available 30 m vegetation soil which includes surface and sub surface thickness and geologic data were downscaled to 20 m resolution using nearest neighbor interpolation 2 4 model calibration with the ultimate intent of matching the model streamflow output to the observed streamflow record to achieve an optimal model configuration we adjusted a select number of parameterized model soil and vegetation values the majority of the dhsvm soil and vegetation parameter values were first obtained from a previous application of the model over the boulder creek watershed badger et al 2021 livneh et al 2014 2015 since gordon gulch lies within this basin and as these past model runs demonstrated realistic simulations of snowmelt and streamflow dynamics we then identified an optimal model configuration by adjusting the following five parameters identified as sensitive by previous studies e g badger et al 2021 livneh et al 2015 yao and yang 2009 hydraulic conductivity vertical exponential factor porosity field capacity and minimum stomatal resistance the physical relationship between these parameters and streamflow are described below section 2 4 10 000 model runs with different combinations of values of the select parameters were sampled following a latin hypercube sampling technique to identify the highest daily nash sutcliffe efficiency nse value a coefficient ranging from to 1 breuer et al 2009 gan et al 2014 livneh et al 2015 song et al 2015 an nse of 1 indicates a perfect match between observed and modeled datasets in this case the observed and modeled hydrographs manache and melching 2004 nash and sutcliffe 1970 uncertainty within observed streamflow was quantified using 95 confidence intervals within the stage discharge relationship for each water year uncertainty within the simulated streamflow was quantified by including the streamflow output range for the top performing 10 of simulations 2 4 1 adjusted parameters for model optimization saturated hydraulic conductivity is the rate of water movement through pores of a saturated soil thus hydraulic conductivity is a function of fluid soil texture and porosity saturated hydraulic conductivity exponentially declines with depth see wigmosta et al 1994 for details porosity is the total volume of empty space voids to soil material which influences the amount of water a given volume of soil can hold in turn influencing the soil moisture at any given timestep field capacity is the amount of moisture held in the soil after excess water has drained away and the rate of downward movement has decreased this value is a fraction of the porosity where a higher field capacity indicates a higher water holding capacity minimum resistance is a vegetation parameter and it is the opposition to transport water vapor to or from the stomata pores on the leaves of plants the environmental dependencies of the minimum resistance include air temperature vapor pressure deficit photosynthetically active radiation flux and soil moisture dickinson et al 1993 feddes et al 1978 wigmosta et al 1994 and a higher minimum resistance value means greater opposition toward water movement through stomata minimum resistance per vegetation layer is a fixed value throughout each model simulation the parameter values selected for the two model simulations are listed in table 2 and the limitations introduced by parameter stationarity are discussed in section 4 1 2 2 5 control and warming simulations we simulated two climate scenarios a control simulation representing the present day atmospheric conditions and a warming simulation representing future atmospheric conditions the control simulation 2000 2013 was forced with historical data from water years 2000 2013 where 2000 2009 was the 10 year spin up period and 2010 2013 was the period used for evaluation in this work data sources are listed in table 1 this control simulation reflects baseline hydrologic conditions for modeled snow fraction swe swi streamflow and pet the penman monteith approach as well as thornthwaite s temperature based model thornthwaite and mather 1955 1957 were used to estimate pet the latter method was used for comparative purposes the end of century 2070 2100 warming scenario was informed by weather research and forecasting wrf model output run in a high resolution pseudo global warming pgw framework by liu et al 2017 the work by liu et al 2017 includes a 13 year historical reanalysis and a 13 year future climate sensitivity simulation with modified initial and boundary conditions set to the high end cmip5 end of century emission scenario as averaged across 19 global climate models see liu et al 2017 for details the work by liu et al 2017 has supported previous assessments of changes in snowpack ikeda et al in review snowmelt musselman et al 2017 and basin scale rain on snow flood risk musselman et al 2018 for the western u s the end of century air temperature relative humidity and longwave radiation data from liu et al 2017 were extracted and averaged for the wrf grid cell encompassing gordon gulch and the eight grid cells neighboring gordon gulch thus the wrf data were averaged into an hourly dataset for one average water year delta values were calculated between the control dataset and the warming dataset and these delta values were then added subtracted from the control dataset to generate a warming dataset of equal length as the control dataset on average annual air temperature increased by 4 7 c compared to the control simulation annual longwave radiation increased by 29 w m2 and annual relative humidity decreased by 2 fig 2 there is confidence that these variables will change with warming gochis et al 2013 while future precipitation changes are less certain for this reason we did not change precipitation amounts in the warming simulation and instead held precipitation constant across simulations the ramifications of this assumption are discussed in section 4 1 by assuming that historical precipitation magnitudes will not change in the future climate we isolated the hydrologic changes associated only with warming subsequent changes in precipitation phase and snowmelt timing and magnitude thus relative to our control simulations our warming experiment permitted an assessment of simulated changes in snowfall fraction swe swi pet thornthwaite and mather 1955 1957 and runoff q characterizing the total hydrological impacts of climate warming because we are explicitly interested in how warming shifts swi in the context of water partitioning we do not consider potential changes in the amount of precipitation as this would not allow us to focus our analyses on our primary questions our analysis of warming included monthly and annual comparisons of water and energy variables of interest rain and snowfall snowmelt pet et swi and q 2 6 budyko analysis of water partitioning we analyzed dhsvm output and differences in hydrologic partitioning between control and warming simulations within the budyko framework budyko 1974 the framework requires the following environmental variables for analysis of hydrologic partitioning precipitation p potential evapotranspiration pet and evapotranspiration et based on long term observations from several catchments globally budyko 1974 developed an empirical relationship between catchment evaporative index et p and its index of aridity pet p eq 3 and fig 3 3 et p pet p tanh p pet 1 exp pet p this framework is broadly used to predict the fraction of precipitation that will be partitioned to streamflow and evapotranspiration q p or 1 et p assuming that changes in et cause compensatory changes in streamflow q berghuijs et al 2014 the budyko framework is based on long term averages and therefore does not consider loss or gain of water via groundwater flow inter basin flow and assumes that there is no change in storage within the catchment whether in groundwater or soil water the latter assumption limits the budyko framework to analysis to annual timesteps most ideally as longer term averages analyses have been conducted using budyko over shorter time scales in which partitioning behavior must be interpreted in consideration of storage dynamics in the system typically catchments with a low aridity index pet p 1 are energy limited with respect to evapotranspiration and catchments with a high aridity index pet p 1 are water limited fig 3a shows the budyko functional relationship between the aridity index horizontal axis and the evaporative index vertical axis on a hypothesized seasonal timescale anomalies from the budyko hypothesis result from overproduction of either catchment q or et below and above the line respectively barnhart et al 2016 relative to historical conditions fig 3a black point water partitioning will change as the aridity index increases in the warming simulation water partitioning may change relative to the expectation which is represented by the budyko curve the catchment may partition precipitation to et and q under increased aridity index as expected following the budyko curve fig 3a green point alternatively the catchment may partition more precipitation to et than expected fig 3a yellow point or more precipitation to q than expected fig 3a blue point comparing hypothetical control and warming conditions fig 3b it is hypothesized that the warming evaporative index in spring months will increase in magnitude from the control evaporative index consistent with the budyko curve without anomalous partitioning fig 3b point control and green star warming in winter months it is hypothesized that the control simulation fig 3b blue point will originally plot below the budyko curve because atmospheric water demand is low during this time period and therefore any swi generated by rain or snowmelt is likely to partition more efficiently to streamflow rather than to plant water use for example during the winter warming simulation fig 3b blue star it is hypothesized that shifts toward earlier snowmelt and from snowfall to rainfall would act to increase winter swi this increase in swi when atmospheric water demand i e pet is still relatively low will act to partition more water to streamflow than expected based on the budyko curve yielding an evaporative index value well below the budyko curve lastly in summer months it is hypothesized that the control simulation fig 3b yellow point may first plot above the budyko curve expressing a water limitation this is a season of increased atmospheric water demand pet rises with seasonal temperatures and the catchment may partition more water to et under warming conditions in the arid western u s we hypothesize that summer months will experience the greatest water limitations fig 3b yellow star with warming it is expected that more swi will occur earlier in the year and less water will persist on the landscape until summer increasing the existing water limitation we used the budyko framework on a monthly timeframe to evaluate monthly water and energy limitations and the successive effects on hydrologic partitioning with each consecutive month associated with changes in antecedent moisture availability holding precipitation constant we isolated monthly changes in modeled pet due to warming and evaluated associated increases or decreases in hydrologic partitioning to et and q due to changes in monthly swi this swi focused approach enables a more direct evaluation to how changes in snow accumulation and snowmelt influence hydrologic partitioning these assumptions allowed us to isolate the relative effects of swi from total hydrologic partitioning change due to warming by assuming changes in the anomaly from the budyko curve were the effect of changes in swi timing and the decoupling of water and energy hence the absolute values represented by the budyko curve are not important to the analyses nor are these magnitudes intended to be directly applicable to monthly partitioning in gordon gulch but rather the change in general behavior between simulations discussed further in section 4 1 3 results the manual calibration of dhsvm resulted in an nse value of 0 85 fig 4 an important statistic for verifying adequate model performance for subsequent results below this statistic is similar to previous work with dhsvm beckers and alila 2004 moriasi et al 2007 surfleet et al 2010 thyer et al 2009 van wie et al 2013 wigmosta and burges 1997 the simulated runoff ratio was 0 17 and the observed runoff ratio was 0 16 with an observed uncertainty range from 0 11 to 0 23 i e associated with typical uncertainties in the rating curve used to relate measured stage height to discharge the percent bias across the entire simulation period was 37 6 ranging between 25 3 in 2013 to 53 7 in 2011 when evaluated by water year 3 1 change in water balance annual and average water budget variables from april 1 2010 to august 31 2013 are listed in table 3 including total soil water total sub surface flow and average water table depth annual precipitation was greater in wy2011 than in wy2012 as was the snow fraction the fraction of total annual precipitation falling as snow the greatest change in snow fraction across the control and warming simulations occurred in winter and early spring months where snowfall in the control simulation transitioned to rain in the warming simulation increases in rain and seasonal changes in snowmelt in the warming simulation altered the timing and magnitude of water partitioned as et and q fig 5 because the incoming precipitation amount was fixed across the two simulations increases or no changes in rain occurred every month of the year with the greatest increases occurring in april and may fig 5a as prescribed by our methodology snowfall decreased in an equal and opposite manner than that of rainfall fig 5b snowmelt decreased overall but increased in december january and february fig 5c the increases in rain and melt caused increases in swi in december and february and in april and may conversely a large decrease in swi occurred in march fig 5d as swi increased in winter months and et remained low fig 5e streamflow increased during these months fig 5f overall the catchment experienced an average annual decrease in streamflow of 22 with a seasonal 15 increase in streamflow during winter and spring months defined here as november through march evaluating the difference between control and warming monthly average values i e warming value minus control value there was a statistically significant positive relationship p 0 01 between δswi and δq where δswi explained 38 of the variability in δq r2 0 38 conversely a statistically significant p 0 01 inverse relationship between δswi and δet where δswi explained 25 of the variability in δet r2 0 25 these results indicate that the change in the timing of swi has a significant impact on q and et which is consistent with first principles related to water partitioning and associated impacts of seasonal water inputs on energy water limitations when including only months when swi changed by at least 5 mm a stronger positive relationship p 0 01 between δswi and δq occurred with an r2 of 0 48 fig 6a similarly the significantly inverse relationship p 0 01 between δswi and δet also increased when months with swi changes below 5 mm were excluded r2 increased to 0 61 fig 6b because we are most interested in the hydrologic response to changes in the timing of swi excluding months with minimal swi change is warranted changes in both swi fig 5d and q fig 5f from the control simulation to the warming simulation were positive in winter months these months exhibited increases in rainfall fig 5a and decreases in snowmelt fig 5c in spring both swi and q decreased in association with decreased snowmelt fig 5c and increased et fig 5e there exist monthly nuances to the relationships between changes in swi et and q as described above in april and may specifically there was a large increase in et and decrease in q but a relatively small change in swi in these months in the control simulation snowfall and snowmelt occurred in rapid succession while snow accumulated in late spring snowstorms the climate is such that the snow melted shortly afterward causing little delay in swi generation i e snowfall and snowmelt occurred in the same month similarly when the catchment was perturbed by the warming simulation and april and may monthly precipitation fell as rain instead of snow there was no change in the timing of swi generation at the monthly time scale relative to the control simulation given that the snowpack does not store water beyond the monthly time scale in the april and may control simulation there were little changes in the timing of swi generation in the warming simulation relative to the control i e because precipitation and swi occurred in the same month in both simulations in march conversely appreciable snowpack water storage occurred in the control simulation hence in the warming simulation the timing of swi generation changed in the warming simulation as snowmelt shifted to earlier months fig 5c february lastly no change in swi occurred in summer months as all precipitation fell as rain in both simulations not affecting the timing of swi notwithstanding et and q both decreased in summer months for the warming simulation likely because of increased summer water limitations associated with a shift in swi to winter months and water storage limitations which are discussed further in section 4 1 3 2 budyko analysis of water partitioning under the warming simulation et p increased less than expected from budyko s function and therefore decreases in q p were less than expected as well table 4 et p did not increase at the level expected from budyko because swi shifted earlier in the year a changed that was associated with warming this change caused winter seasonal increases in q which offset the overall annual decrease in q according to the budyko hypothesis the expected annual average runoff ratio under warming conditions based on the aridity index calculated from the warming simulation pet p 2 85 was 0 073 the catchment instead experienced an annual average runoff ratio of 0 12 indicating a 4 7 increase in streamflow i e 0 12 0 073 associated with the shift in swi timing examining the monthly budyko comparisons illustrated how the modeled water partitioning changed due to warming and changes in swi timing in this respect fig 7 shows that under warming winter months blue stars and early spring months march april green stars plot further below the budyko curve than the corresponding control simulation winter months blue circles spring months green circles because this time period is primarily energy limited the increased swi exhibited relatively lower partitioning to et and greater partitioning to streamflow than expected by budyko the reductions in et partitioning relative to budyko are also seen in the water limited summer months fig 7 red stars versus corresponding red circles this occurred because shifts toward earlier swi in previous months increased water limitations with respect to summer et the combined effects of decreased et partitioning relative to budyko in both winter to early spring months and in summer months resulted in an overall reduction in annual et partitioning relative to the budyko expectation importantly one would not expect this type of warming response for a rain dominated system because shifts in swi timing would not occur in any month in fig 8a d we show both the raw values and the changes across the control and warming simulations as a difference value in average monthly et p fig 8a and swi fig 8b to further evaluate the mechanistic impact swi has on catchment hydrologic partitioning in the warming simulation et p increases in winter and early spring months and decreases in summer months fig 8c these changes coincide with water availability or lack of in the form of swi in the warming simulation increased swi is generated in winter months due to more rainfall and earlier snowmelt events which caused decreased swi in later months i e march fig 8d similarly the notable decrease in swi in march in the warming simulation explains the subsequent decreased et p in june because water limitations in june are enhanced by the shift toward earlier swi lastly the notable increases in swi under warming conditions are seen in the average monthly differences in swi in december and february the change in january swi is less dramatic as swi was generally low in the four represented years averaged in fig 8b and january was likely less sensitive to warming than december and february as it is climatologically the coldest month in this catchment 4 discussion 4 1 assumptions and limitations 4 1 1 precipitation we limited our warming perturbations to air temperature relative humidity and incoming longwave radiation by amounts shown in fig 2 across the control and warming simulations we held historical precipitation constant allowing precipitation amount to change would have eliminated a means of deciphering how changes in swi impact et and q as changes in precipitation would have also impacted partitioning brooks et al 2015 kalra and ahmad 2011 wang and alimohammadi 2012 holding p constant in the warming simulation likely created amplified water limitations in the summertime where we saw monthly decreases in et p a number of studies have highlighted uncertainties in future precipitation by end of current century across the western u s liu et al 2017 estimated increases in wintertime precipitation between 40 and 70 with greater increases expected in high elevation mountainous regions changes in precipitation during the summer season are less defined and more variable kittel et al 2015 showed that historical precipitation trends on the front range of colorado 1952 to 2010 are unclear as precipitation increased approximately 60 mm per decade at an alpine site 3739 m but showed no trend at a nearby subalpine site 3022 m they suggested that precipitation variability is more strongly associated with decadal variability as both warm and wet and warm and dry periods will occur in the future in the greater upper colorado river basin end of current century precipitation projections are equally unclear with predictions ranging from a 60 decline at lower elevations to as much as a 74 increase at high elevations christensen et al 2004 group et al 2015 kopytkovskiya et al 2015 miller et al 2014 minder et al 2017 using this information we posit that if the wintertime precipitation were to fall as snow but snowmelt still occurred earlier due to simulated warming this seasonal increase in precipitation would reinforce our finding regarding a buffering effect associated with a shift in the timing of swi and associated increases in winter q the same result would occur if the future increased wintertime precipitation were to fall as rain as swi would be generated immediately in the colder months when pet is relatively low partitioning more swi to q increasing winter season runoff and buffering overall annual decreases in q precipitation increases in the future could alleviate catchment water limitations and therefore the summer decreases in et p noted herein may not be applicable to scenarios of increased precipitation irrespective of potential precipitation trends first principles determine that a shift in swi will occur with warming and thus the buffering concept revealed here would remain evident in addition predictions of future precipitation are highly uncertain and therefore limiting our study to the more certain projections of increased temperature allows for a more tractable scope in our analyses lastly the scale and accuracy of precipitation forcing data may have dramatic impacts on streamflow simulations in particular extreme peaks even at smaller catchment scales spatial variability of precipitation has been shown to translate into large variations in modeled runoff faurès et al 1995 goodrich et al 1995 thus in fig 4 where the model is unable to accurately capture the runoff peaks observed in gordon gulch could be the result of precipitation variability across the catchment that was not represented in the modeled forcing data this limitation may be improved with high resolution precipitation data and or including a longer simulation period which may enhance the model calibration process 4 1 2 storage additional stationarity was assumed across control and warming model simulations in soil and vegetation parameters dhsvm was initially optimized in the control simulation to the historic streamflow record and we assumed that those parameters which influence sub surface flow and storage were transferrable to the future warming simulation it is likely that these parameters will change in the next century introducing a limitation to the methodology used in this work however changes in soil properties in particular are likely to occur more rapidly in time under future warming to soils high in organic matter which are less common in colorado front range which are low in organic matter karmakar et al 2016 further in both simulations stomatal minimum resistance remains the same throughout one water year kaufmann 1982 wigmosta et al 1994 which is not always accurate in a forested area irmak and mutiibwa 2009 next by evaluating hydrologic partitioning with a monthly scale budyko analysis our evaluation of hydrologic storage within gordon gulch across months is relative i e we focus on the change in general behavior between simulations because the budyko framework is based on long term observations the prediction of an evaporative index from a given aridity index does not consider carry over in water availability i e storage from month to month thus when evaluating hydrologic partitioning on a monthly timescale et p can exceed a value of 1 as seen in fig 7 and in previous works using the budyko framework on a shortened monthly timeframe du et al 2016 2014 yokoo et al 2008 zhang et al 2008 du et al 2016 address this exceedance by parameterizing water supply as precipitation in addition to root zone water storage change thus because we do not explicitly quantify root zone water storage change in our analysis we instead assess monthly hydrologic partitioning as relative between our two model simulations where our results suggest general catchment behavioral differences between a control and warming scenario however water storage in the root zone and water table i e soil and sub surface storage can impact the monthly budyko values by increasing et from stored water in the soil and vegetation in months where p may be low e g control simulation summer months in fig 7 when et exceeds p subsequently once root zone storage is depleted in the semi arid environment et will significantly decrease despite any p input as there is no remaining water e g control simulation fall months in fig 7 when et p again drops below 1 4 1 3 model uncertainties there are inherent uncertainties in the dhsvm simulations associated with model forcings parameters and model structure fixed and unfixed parameters attempt to represent an intricate and dramatic landscape and capture environmental micro dynamics and interactions however each parameter introduces an assumption about the landscape where observations are often lacking stewart et al 2017 wigmosta et al 1994 du et al 2014 zhao et al 2009 this was particularly true with soil parameters where porosity and field capacity are often poorly known across any given catchment the representation of the water table bedrock interface within the model where impermeable bedrock underlies the water table wigmosta et al 1994 also poses a limitation as it simplifies the underlying structure present in gordon gulch where deep groundwater flow contributes to runoff the streamflow record of gordon gulch also posed limitations to our study where only three years were available for analysis and model parameter estimation owing to the relatively small catchment area 2 6 km2 and semi arid climate 520 mm annual precipitation the streamflow volumes in gordon gulch are relatively small and are highly variable e g 2011 was highly snow dominated snow fraction 0 53 whereas 2012 was dominated by summer rainfall snow fraction 0 39 given these small and variable fluxes capturing the temporal variability of streamflow within any hydrologic model is challenging 4 2 implications previous works have suggested that regions with greater proportional snowfall versus rainfall have relatively greater streamflow berghuijs et al 2014 klos et al 2014 such differences across catchments have been attributed to groundwater dynamics and the catchment drainage rate safeeq et al 2013 tague and grant 2009 as well as the rate of snowmelt barnhart et al 2016 as warming shifts surface water inputs from snowfall to rainfall and causes earlier snowmelt and peak runoff tennant et al 2015 runoff ratios will decrease follum et al 2019 livneh and badger 2020 zhang et al 2018 yet missing from these preceding assessments of snowmelt driven changes in streamflow under warming has been an in depth analysis of how the timing of surface water inputs will change and how this change will impact streamflow generation the analyses presented herein address this knowledge gap by estimating future changes in hydrologic partitioning associated with an alteration of surface water input seasonality the shift in swi caused a 15 increase in winter streamflow which acts as a relative buffer to the 22 annual loss in modeled streamflow the resulting overall decrease in annual streamflow with seasonal increases in winter streamflow presented here is complementary to several previous studies imposing warming conditions on historical records both christensen et al 2004 and mccabe and wolock 2016 estimated an end of 20th century annual decrease in streamflow of 17 in the colorado river basin christensen and lettenmaier 2006 2007 estimated an end of century annual decrease in streamflow of 8 11 across the colorado river basin the entirety of western north america is projected by climate model ensembles and the variable infiltration capacity vic model to experience an annual decrease in runoff of 10 30 by 2050 christensen and lettenmaier 2006 2007 milly et al 2005 seasonally hamlet and lettenmaier 1999 using the vic model across the western united states saw overall decreases in streamflow but with wintertime increases up to 50 due to increased precipitation while our results fit within the range of annual streamflow projections these previous studies leave a need to determine the mechanism for the associated hydrologic changes related to changes in the timing of swi generation past sub seasonal analyses of hydrologic sensitivity to climate warming have the potential to reveal mechanisms for streamflow change for example foster et al 2016 evaluated catchment increases in et and precipitation phase change at two mountainous locations in colorado and determined that an increase in et created larger decreases in q compared to precipitation phase changes suggesting that increases in et primarily drive decreases in q in this study winter and spring increases in rainfall fraction and earlier snowmelt events resulted in increased swi and associated increases in seasonal streamflow it is also possible that winter and spring swi increases will recharge groundwater that can support the et of deep rooted vegetation streamflow later in the season or groundwater export from the catchment analyses using the budyko framework revealed a smaller increase in evaporative index i e et p than expected under a warming scenario table 4 fig 7 yellow points stars green points stars in this respect the anomaly from the budyko curve increased with warming resulting in a larger runoff ratio than that expected based on the budyko hypothesis as swi shifted toward winter months when atmospheric water demand was relatively low q p increased such sensitivity of the water balance to the seasonality of climate is consistent with nasta et al 2020 and milly s supply demand storage model demonstrating that when p seasonality and pet seasonality are in phase catchments will experience a higher et p ratio than when p seasonality and pet seasonality are out of phase milly 1994a b nasta et al 2020 williams et al 2012 temporal differences in the seasonal timing of rainfall caused up to a 20 difference in et p where a longer wetter season more rainfall in the winter and spring months caused a lower et p and conversely greater q p and a departure below the budyko curve nasta et al 2020 within a simulated warming climate streamflow was sensitive to both increased pet and changes in swi timing where increased pet acted to decrease q but earlier swi acted to increase q swi increased in the winter months when pet was relatively low decoupling catchment water supply i e swi and atmospheric water demand i e pet and increasing winter streamflow under warming conditions annual mean streamflow still decreased overall but increased in winter demonstrating how the original presence of snow in the control simulation buffered and offset the overall decrease in q due to simulated warming this buffering effect of increased wintertime streamflow is specific to snow dominated catchments where buffering of climate sensitivity is associated with shifts in swi timing such sensitivity is buffered until snow longer falls within a catchment as swi produced by solely rainfall timing will not be affected by warming and no seasonal streamflow climate sensitivity buffer will exist 5 conclusions in this analysis the timing of surface water input swi shifted toward earlier in the year due to warming and subsequent decreases in snowfall fraction and earlier snowmelt events as a result average annual winter and early spring streamflow q increased by 15 despite an average annual streamflow decrease of 22 hydrologic partitioning within the catchment shifted toward increased et but less than would be expected within the budyko hypothesis in this regard winter increases in swi resulted in a seasonal increase in annual q relative to the expected value based on budyko these wintertime swi increases caused successive summertime drying which decreased partitioning to et p when there exist seasonal water limitations which were amplified under warming conditions to obtain these results the distributed soil hydrology vegetation model dhsvm was used to simulate a control and warming scenario in a small upper montane catchment in the front range of colorado in order to evaluate solely the effects of swi on q precipitation amount but not phase was held constant and landcover and soil properties were considered stationary across simulations this approach meant that the model results were most informative when relatively compared against one another as opposed to presented as absolute transferrable values a future study may evaluate annual and seasonal swi and q in a non stationary scenario where the isolated effect of each variable on q would need to be identified in order to create a meaningful swi q relationship we predict that by first principles the increased winter season q as a result of increased swi from earlier snowmelt would remain overall the winter spring streamflow increases and increased q p in budyko space represent a buffering effect with respect to hydrologic sensitivity to climate change that is specific to snow dominated catchments as climate warming continues losses in snow cover may exceed a threshold in which snowmelt becomes an insignificant hydrologic driver and this seasonal streamflow buffering effect will no longer exist thus the findings here represent an expected hydrologic response in near future conditions within the colorado front range whereby subsequent responses may reflect more rain dominated conditions critically the temporal distribution of swi generation and future changes will change where and when water resources will arrive downstream influencing the reliant surrounding ecosystems

8064,study region gordon gulch an upper montane forest watershed in the colorado front range study focus as the climate warms the fraction of precipitation falling as snow is expected to decrease and the timing of snowmelt is expected to shift earlier in spring in snow dominated regions these changes in snow accumulation and melt prompt us to examine downstream changes in streamflow the objective of this study is to understand how changes in precipitation phase and snowmelt timing alter the timing of surface water inputs i e rainfall and snowmelt and the partitioning of these inputs between evapotranspiration and streamflow we used the distributed hydrology soil vegetation model and weather research and forecasting model based projections of future climatic conditions to simulate streamflow new hydrological insights for the region modeled annual streamflow decreased by 22 for the period 2071 2100 surface water inputs increased during winter when atmospheric water demand was relatively low subsequently the winter period partitioning of water as rain or snowmelt to streamflow as opposed to evapotranspiration increased by 15 while partitioning to evapotranspiration decreased effectively buffering what would have otherwise been a larger net streamflow decline associated with warming seasonal streamflow buffering is unique to snow influenced systems as the magnitude and timing of water released from snowpacks is sensitive to warming this effect may diminish as warming drives snow influenced systems toward rain dominance with implications for

region mountain hydrology is how warming may modify the timing of water input to the terrestrial system we posit that a critical component of hydrologic sensitivity to climate change due to changes in snowfall and snowmelt arises from changes in the timing of water delivery to the terrestrial system broadly defined as the land surface beneath a snowpack in this context we define surface water inputs swi as rainfall on the land surface and snowmelt water leaving the base of the snowpack swi is thus the sum of liquid water available to the terrestrial system at a given time which can then be partitioned to streamflow q or evapotranspiration et or enter the subsurface as storage brooks et al 2015 kiewiet et al 2021 kormos et al 2014 hence as the temporal dynamics of either rainfall or snowmelt change with warming a change in the alignment of swi and potential evaporation pet will occur kormos et al 2014 in the upper montane forest of the colorado front range periods of high swi align with periods of mid to high potential evapotranspiration pet kormos et al 2014 precipitation falls as snow during wintertime months and snow water equivalent swe accumulation stores water until the snowpack melts creating a lag in the timing between snowfall and swi generation the snowmelt period produces a large sustained pulse of swi in the spring months a time of increased pet barnett et al 2005 brooks et al 2015 kampf and lefsky 2016 kormos et al 2014 luce et al 1998 marks et al 1998 milly and dunne 2016 scheff and frierson 2014 sturm et al 2010 unlike the higher alpine areas of colorado mountainous regions snow accumulation in the montane area studied here is more spatially variable as a result snowmelt is not as spatially uniform or as consistent in time as it is in higher elevation areas we hypothesize that within an end of current century warmer climate scenario the seasonality of catchment swi and catchment pet may become misaligned with unknown effects on seasonal streamflow under warmer temperatures swe accumulation will likely be lower and less persistent throughout the winter reducing or eliminating the large spring melt pulse barnhart et al 2016 cayan et al 2001 knowles et al 2005 kormos et al 2014 musselman et al 2017 rasmussen et al 2014 regonda and rajagopalan 2004 as snowfall shifts to rainfall and as snowmelt shifts earlier swi will shift earlier in the year during a time of decreased atmospheric water demand i e pet previous works have evaluated streamflow sensitivity to climate e g tennant et al 2015 but have not identified mechanistically the role of changes in the timing of swi with regard to streamflow production on annual to monthly time scales to address this knowledge gap we applied the distributed hydrology soil vegetation model dhsvm to simulate streamflow under historical conditions and a warmer climate scenario informed by high resolution weather and climate model runs liu et al 2017 dhsvm was forced with historical metrological data from in catchment and nearby weather stations whenever available and weather research forecast wrf model output to impose warming conditions we isolated model states and fluxes to estimate how warming driven changes in the timing of modeled swi influence catchment streamflow analyses specifically included correlations and evaluation of delta values i e the differences in annual and seasonal swi et and q across model simulations when compared against historical conditions previous modeling studies have reported net decreases in modeled annual streamflow and net increases in annual pet associated with climate warming adam et al 2009 anghileri et al 2016 clow 2010 mahanama et al 2012 siddique and palmer 2021 tang and lettenmaier 2012 other modeling studies have predicted future increases in wintertime streamflow siddique et al 2021a b despite overall annual decreases mahanama et al 2012 siddique et al 2020 2021a b and shifts in peak streamflow timing tennant et al 2015 yet the mechanism driving the increase in seasonal winter streamflow and its effect on annual hydrologic partitioning remains to be defined and evaluated we predict that the timing of swi may change monthly water balance partitioning providing a much needed explanation to previous partitioning analyses berghuijs et al 2014 kormos et al 2014 to explore potential changes in partitioning we analyzed dhsvm model output in the context of the budyko hypothesis budyko 1974 a framework that predicts partitioning of incoming water between streamflow or evapotranspiration based on an index of aridity pet p the following question is addressed how does climate warming and subsequent changes in the timing of swi affect monthly and annual streamflow generation and water partitioning within a continental upper montane catchment we hypothesized that an increase in rainfall and earlier snowmelt events induced by warming would temporally decouple catchment water availability i e swi and atmospheric water demand i e pet and thus will increase cold season hydrologic partitioning to streamflow understanding a potential mechanism to changes in annual and seasonal water availability would allow for more accurate water management planning as the climate continues to warm mote et al 2018 the novelty of this study is the model based quantification of the decoupling of swi and pet which isolates swi as a potential driver of hydrologic change evaluated through the seasonal changes in modeled winter and early spring streamflow that potentially offset overall reductions in modeled annual streamflow 2 study area and methods we conducted this research in the gordon gulch catchment which is located within the upper montane forest marr 1961 of the front range colorado usa 40

wigmosta and lettenmaier 1999 yao and yang 2009 at each time interval the model solves energy and water balance equations for every grid cell in the select watershed wigmosta et al 1994 using model forcings i e precipitation air temperature wind speed incident shortwave radiation relative humidity and net radiation components and state variables e g topographic vegetation and soil

flow dynamics pet is calculated using the penman monteith approach slope and aspect are accounted for in dhsvm by the characterization of shortwave and longwave radiation within the surface energy budget wigmosta et al 1994 the soil vegetation water balance in dhsvm accounts for rooting zone water storage overstory and understory interception evaporation and transpiration surface soil evaporation snowpack water content and volume of precipitation wigmosta et al 1994 dhsvm simulates the exchange of water between grid cells resulting in a three dimensional redistribution of surface and subsurface water across the landscape wigmosta et al 1994 dhsvm moves water between grid cells as overland flow channel flow and or shallow subsurface flow in the soil the subsurface water storage in the soil is a function of soil depth and depth to the root zones in each soil layer where increased soil depth allows for increased storage mcnamara et al 2005 all through fall water or snowmelt that which is not intercepted enters the soil column and becomes subsurface storage through unsaturated moisture movement once the soil becomes saturated excess water becomes surface runoff thus soil vegetation water balance within one grid cell is defined as see fig 2 in wigmosta et al 1994 1 δ s s 1 δ s s 2 δ s s 3 δ s io δ s iu δ w p e io e iu e s e to e tu p 2 where δ s s 1 and δ s s 2 and δ s s 3 are the changes in the three rooting zones soil water storage respectively δ s io is the change in overstory interception and δ s iu is the change in understory interception δ w is the change in snowpack water content p is the volume of precipitation rain and or snow p2 is the discharge volume leaving the lowest rooting zone e s is the volume of surface soil evaporation and e io e iu e to and e tu are the volumes of overstory and understory evaporation from interception storage and transpiration respectively via darcy s law using the brooks corey eq 1 water percolates through the root zones one defined root zone per soil layer until discharge from the lower rooting zone recharges the local grid cell specific water table wigmosta et al 1994 zhao et al 2009 each grid cell then exchanges saturated water with its eight adjacent neighbors see fig 4 in wigmosta et al 1994 on subsurface flow routing 2 q v θ ks θ θ r ϕ θ r 2 m 3 where q ν is the percolation term ks is the soil vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity ϕ is the soil porosity θr is the residual soil moisture content and m is the pore size distribution index soil transmissivity is calculated assuming that soil lateral saturated hydraulic conductivity decreases exponentially with depth finally dhsvm was modified to partition precipitation phase based on the probability of rain or snow at a given time step using a bivariate binary logistic regression jennings et al 2018 wigmosta and perkins 2001 zhao et al 2009 two dhsvm simulations were run at a 20 m resolution on an hourly timestep a historic control simulation from april 1 2010 to august 31 2013 with a 10 year spin up period and a warming simulation representing an end of current century 2070 2100 climate see section 2 4 2 3 data sources 2 3 1 meteorological variables the sources of model input data are listed in table 1 and include a fusion of in situ measurements from within catchment stations and nearby stations and meteorological reanalyses from the national land data assimilation system nldas2 homer et al 2015 mitchell et al 2004 the purpose of blending these datasets was to build a complete record for the study period across water years 2000 2013 which included a 10 year spin up period from 2000 to 2009 to generate a complete precipitation record we prioritized the most direct measurements within the gordon gulch catchment whenever available in catchment meteorological stations included the gordon gulch north facing meteorological station ggl nf met and the gordon gulch south facing meteorological station ggl sf met during instances when the in catchment measurements were not available nearby meteorological stations were secondarily prioritized which included the national atmospheric deposition program nadp co94 site 2 km south of gordon gulch elevation of 2390 m and the betasso preserve meteorological station bt met 10 2 km east elevation of 2000 m and niwot ridge c1 meteorological station 6 5 km west elevation of 3022 m the order in which these different meteorological stations were prioritized to create a complete precipitation record is outlined in table 1 the nldas2 dataset was prioritized when any remaining gaps in the meteorological record remained with the exception of precipitation the nldas2 record contains a complete record of all required meteorological model input variables air temperature wind speed incident shortwave radiation relative humidity and longwave radiation and were downscaled from 12 km to 20 m resolution using nearest neighbor interpolation the nldas2 meteorological record for these variables was bias corrected using the in catchment and nearby meteorology stations the bias correction process included calculating hourly averages of meteorological station observations which were at a 10 min temporal resolution finding all instances when meteorological station and nldas2 data were both available fitting a linear model through nldas2 data vs meteorological station data using linear model parameters to approximate station observations in gordon gulch from nldas2 record the order in which different meteorological stations were prioritized to bias correct the nldas2 record to create a complete meteorological record except precipitation is outlined in table 1 2 3 2 streamflow there is one streamflow gage in gordon gulch on the eastern end of the catchment fig 1 streamflow stage is recorded and streamflow observations in m3 s are derived from existing annual stage discharge relationships anderson and ragar 2020a b c data are available at 10 min intervals and were aggregated to an hourly time series for use in dhsvm 2 3 3 vegetation soil and geology vegetation and soil types were obtained at 30 m resolution from the national land cover database https www mrlc gov data f 5b0 5d category 3aland 20cover accessed june 2017 and natural resources conservation services https www nrcs usda gov wps portal nrcs detail soils survey geo cid nrcseprd1464625 accessed june 2017 respectively the dominant vegetation types in gordon gulch are evergreen forest and shrubs the dominant soil type is sandy loam shea 2013 spatially distributed geology data for the area is available at a 30 m resolution from the usgs the underlying catchment geology includes biotite and felsic gneiss and granite granitoid diabase quartz latite anderson et al 2021 within dhsvm these were categorized as metasedimentary and metavolcanics rocks and intrusive igneous respectively the mobile regolith bedrock interface is located above the water table in gordon gulch the available 30 m vegetation soil which includes surface and sub surface thickness and geologic data were downscaled to 20 m resolution using nearest neighbor interpolation 2 4 model calibration with the ultimate intent of matching the model streamflow output to the observed streamflow record to achieve an optimal model configuration we adjusted a select number of parameterized model soil and vegetation values the majority of the dhsvm soil and vegetation parameter values were first obtained from a previous application of the model over the boulder creek watershed badger et al 2021 livneh et al 2014 2015 since gordon gulch lies within this basin and as these past model runs demonstrated realistic simulations of snowmelt and streamflow dynamics we then identified an optimal model configuration by adjusting the following five parameters identified as sensitive by previous studies e g badger et al 2021 livneh et al 2015 yao and yang 2009 hydraulic conductivity vertical exponential factor porosity field capacity and minimum stomatal resistance the physical relationship between these parameters and streamflow are described below section 2 4 10 000 model runs with different combinations of values of the select parameters were sampled following a latin hypercube sampling technique to identify the highest daily nash sutcliffe efficiency nse value a coefficient ranging from to 1 breuer et al 2009 gan et al 2014 livneh et al 2015 song et al 2015 an nse of 1 indicates a perfect match between observed and modeled datasets in this case the observed and modeled hydrographs manache and melching 2004 nash and sutcliffe 1970 uncertainty within observed streamflow was quantified using 95 confidence intervals within the stage discharge relationship for each water year uncertainty within the simulated streamflow was quantified by including the streamflow output range for the top performing 10 of simulations 2 4 1 adjusted parameters for model optimization saturated hydraulic conductivity is the rate of water movement through pores of a saturated soil thus hydraulic conductivity is a function of fluid soil texture and porosity saturated hydraulic conductivity exponentially declines with depth see wigmosta et al 1994 for details porosity is the total volume of empty space voids to soil material which influences the amount of water a given volume of soil can hold in turn influencing the soil moisture at any given timestep field capacity is the amount of moisture held in the soil after excess water has drained away and the rate of downward movement has decreased this value is a fraction of the porosity where a higher field capacity indicates a higher water holding capacity minimum resistance is a vegetation parameter and it is the opposition to transport water vapor to or from the stomata pores on the leaves of plants the environmental dependencies of the minimum resistance include air temperature vapor pressure deficit photosynthetically active radiation flux and soil moisture dickinson et al 1993 feddes et al 1978 wigmosta et al 1994 and a higher minimum resistance value means greater opposition toward water movement through stomata minimum resistance per vegetation layer is a fixed value throughout each model simulation the parameter values selected for the two model simulations are listed in table 2 and the limitations introduced by parameter stationarity are discussed in section 4 1 2 2 5 control and warming simulations we simulated two climate scenarios a control simulation representing the present day atmospheric conditions and a warming simulation representing future atmospheric conditions the control simulation 2000 2013 was forced with historical data from water years 2000 2013 where 2000 2009 was the 10 year spin up period and 2010 2013 was the period used for evaluation in this work data sources are listed in table 1 this control simulation reflects baseline hydrologic conditions for modeled snow fraction swe swi streamflow and pet the penman monteith approach as well as thornthwaite s temperature based model thornthwaite and mather 1955 1957 were used to estimate pet the latter method was used for comparative purposes the end of century 2070 2100 warming scenario was informed by weather research and forecasting wrf model output run in a high resolution pseudo global warming pgw framework by liu et al 2017 the work by liu et al 2017 includes a 13 year historical reanalysis and a 13 year future climate sensitivity simulation with modified initial and boundary conditions set to the high end cmip5 end of century emission scenario as averaged across 19 global climate models see liu et al 2017 for details the work by liu et al 2017 has supported previous assessments of changes in snowpack ikeda et al in review snowmelt musselman et al 2017 and basin scale rain on snow flood risk musselman et al 2018 for the western u s the end of century air temperature relative humidity and longwave radiation data from liu et al 2017 were extracted and averaged for the wrf grid cell encompassing gordon gulch and the eight grid cells neighboring gordon gulch thus the wrf data were averaged into an hourly dataset for one average water year delta values were calculated between the control dataset and the warming dataset and these delta values were then added subtracted from the control dataset to generate a warming dataset of equal length as the control dataset on average annual air temperature increased by 4 7 c compared to the control simulation annual longwave radiation increased by 29 w m2 and annual relative humidity decreased by 2 fig 2 there is confidence that these variables will change with warming gochis et al 2013 while future precipitation changes are less certain for this reason we did not change precipitation amounts in the warming simulation and instead held precipitation constant across simulations the ramifications of this assumption are discussed in section 4 1 by assuming that historical precipitation magnitudes will not change in the future climate we isolated the hydrologic changes associated only with warming subsequent changes in precipitation phase and snowmelt timing and magnitude thus relative to our control simulations our warming experiment permitted an assessment of simulated changes in snowfall fraction swe swi pet thornthwaite and mather 1955 1957 and runoff q characterizing the total hydrological impacts of climate warming because we are explicitly interested in how warming shifts swi in the context of water partitioning we do not consider potential changes in the amount of precipitation as this would not allow us to focus our analyses on our primary questions our analysis of warming included monthly and annual comparisons of water and energy variables of interest rain and snowfall snowmelt pet et swi and q 2 6 budyko analysis of water partitioning we analyzed dhsvm output and differences in hydrologic partitioning between control and warming simulations within the budyko framework budyko 1974 the framework requires the following environmental variables for analysis of hydrologic partitioning precipitation p potential evapotranspiration pet and evapotranspiration et based on long term observations from several catchments globally budyko 1974 developed an empirical relationship between catchment evaporative index et p and its index of aridity pet p eq 3 and fig 3 3 et p pet p tanh p pet 1 exp pet p this framework is broadly used to predict the fraction of precipitation that will be partitioned to streamflow and evapotranspiration q p or 1 et p assuming that changes in et cause compensatory changes in streamflow q berghuijs et al 2014 the budyko framework is based on long term averages and therefore does not consider loss or gain of water via groundwater flow inter basin flow and assumes that there is no change in storage within the catchment whether in groundwater or soil water the latter assumption limits the budyko framework to analysis to annual timesteps most ideally as longer term averages analyses have been conducted using budyko over shorter time scales in which partitioning behavior must be interpreted in consideration of storage dynamics in the system typically catchments with a low aridity index pet p 1 are energy limited with respect to evapotranspiration and catchments with a high aridity index pet p 1 are water limited fig 3a shows the budyko functional relationship between the aridity index horizontal axis and the evaporative index vertical axis on a hypothesized seasonal timescale anomalies from the budyko hypothesis result from overproduction of either catchment q or et below and above the line respectively barnhart et al 2016 relative to historical conditions fig 3a black point water partitioning will change as the aridity index increases in the warming simulation water partitioning may change relative to the expectation which is represented by the budyko curve the catchment may partition precipitation to et and q under increased aridity index as expected following the budyko curve fig 3a green point alternatively the catchment may partition more precipitation to et than expected fig 3a yellow point or more precipitation to q than expected fig 3a blue point comparing hypothetical control and warming conditions fig 3b it is hypothesized that the warming evaporative index in spring months will increase in magnitude from the control evaporative index consistent with the budyko curve without anomalous partitioning fig 3b point control and green star warming in winter months it is hypothesized that the control simulation fig 3b blue point will originally plot below the budyko curve because atmospheric water demand is low during this time period and therefore any swi generated by rain or snowmelt is likely to partition more efficiently to streamflow rather than to plant water use for example during the winter warming simulation fig 3b blue star it is hypothesized that shifts toward earlier snowmelt and from snowfall to rainfall would act to increase winter swi this increase in swi when atmospheric water demand i e pet is still relatively low will act to partition more water to streamflow than expected based on the budyko curve yielding an evaporative index value well below the budyko curve lastly in summer months it is hypothesized that the control simulation fig 3b yellow point may first plot above the budyko curve expressing a water limitation this is a season of increased atmospheric water demand pet rises with seasonal temperatures and the catchment may partition more water to et under warming conditions in the arid western u s we hypothesize that summer months will experience the greatest water limitations fig 3b yellow star with warming it is expected that more swi will occur earlier in the year and less water will persist on the landscape until summer increasing the existing water limitation we used the budyko framework on a monthly timeframe to evaluate monthly water and energy limitations and the successive effects on hydrologic partitioning with each consecutive month associated with changes in antecedent moisture availability holding precipitation constant we isolated monthly changes in modeled pet due to warming and evaluated associated increases or decreases in hydrologic partitioning to et and q due to changes in monthly swi this swi focused approach enables a more direct evaluation to how changes in snow accumulation and snowmelt influence hydrologic partitioning these assumptions allowed us to isolate the relative effects of swi from total hydrologic partitioning change due to warming by assuming changes in the anomaly from the budyko curve were the effect of changes in swi timing and the decoupling of water and energy hence the absolute values represented by the budyko curve are not important to the analyses nor are these magnitudes intended to be directly applicable to monthly partitioning in gordon gulch but rather the change in general behavior between simulations discussed further in section 4 1 3 results the manual calibration of dhsvm resulted in an nse value of 0 85 fig 4 an important statistic for verifying adequate model performance for subsequent results below this statistic is similar to previous work with dhsvm beckers and alila 2004 moriasi et al 2007 surfleet et al 2010 thyer et al 2009 van wie et al 2013 wigmosta and burges 1997 the simulated runoff ratio was 0 17 and the observed runoff ratio was 0 16 with an observed uncertainty range from 0 11 to 0 23 i e associated with typical uncertainties in the rating curve used to relate measured stage height to discharge the percent bias across the entire simulation period was 37 6 ranging between 25 3 in 2013 to 53 7 in 2011 when evaluated by water year 3 1 change in water balance annual and average water budget variables from april 1 2010 to august 31 2013 are listed in table 3 including total soil water total sub surface flow and average water table depth annual precipitation was greater in wy2011 than in wy2012 as was the snow fraction the fraction of total annual precipitation falling as snow the greatest change in snow fraction across the control and warming simulations occurred in winter and early spring months where snowfall in the control simulation transitioned to rain in the warming simulation increases in rain and seasonal changes in snowmelt in the warming simulation altered the timing and magnitude of water partitioned as et and q fig 5 because the incoming precipitation amount was fixed across the two simulations increases or no changes in rain occurred every month of the year with the greatest increases occurring in april and may fig 5a as prescribed by our methodology snowfall decreased in an equal and opposite manner than that of rainfall fig 5b snowmelt decreased overall but increased in december january and february fig 5c the increases in rain and melt caused increases in swi in december and february and in april and may conversely a large decrease in swi occurred in march fig 5d as swi increased in winter months and et remained low fig 5e streamflow increased during these months fig 5f overall the catchment experienced an average annual decrease in streamflow of 22 with a seasonal 15 increase in streamflow during winter and spring months defined here as november through march evaluating the difference between control and warming monthly average values i e warming value minus control value there was a statistically significant positive relationship p 0 01 between δswi and δq where δswi explained 38 of the variability in δq r2 0 38 conversely a statistically significant p 0 01 inverse relationship between δswi and δet where δswi explained 25 of the variability in δet r2 0 25 these results indicate that the change in the timing of swi has a significant impact on q and et which is consistent with first principles related to water partitioning and associated impacts of seasonal water inputs on energy water limitations when including only months when swi changed by at least 5 mm a stronger positive relationship p 0 01 between δswi and δq occurred with an r2 of 0 48 fig 6a similarly the significantly inverse relationship p 0 01 between δswi and δet also increased when months with swi changes below 5 mm were excluded r2 increased to 0 61 fig 6b because we are most interested in the hydrologic response to changes in the timing of swi excluding months with minimal swi change is warranted changes in both swi fig 5d and q fig 5f from the control simulation to the warming simulation were positive in winter months these months exhibited increases in rainfall fig 5a and decreases in snowmelt fig 5c in spring both swi and q decreased in association with decreased snowmelt fig 5c and increased et fig 5e there exist monthly nuances to the relationships between changes in swi et and q as described above in april and may specifically there was a large increase in et and decrease in q but a relatively small change in swi in these months in the control simulation snowfall and snowmelt occurred in rapid succession while snow accumulated in late spring snowstorms the climate is such that the snow melted shortly afterward causing little delay in swi generation i e snowfall and snowmelt occurred in the same month similarly when the catchment was perturbed by the warming simulation and april and may monthly precipitation fell as rain instead of snow there was no change in the timing of swi generation at the monthly time scale relative to the control simulation given that the snowpack does not store water beyond the monthly time scale in the april and may control simulation there were little changes in the timing of swi generation in the warming simulation relative to the control i e because precipitation and swi occurred in the same month in both simulations in march conversely appreciable snowpack water storage occurred in the control simulation hence in the warming simulation the timing of swi generation changed in the warming simulation as snowmelt shifted to earlier months fig 5c february lastly no change in swi occurred in summer months as all precipitation fell as rain in both simulations not affecting the timing of swi notwithstanding et and q both decreased in summer months for the warming simulation likely because of increased summer water limitations associated with a shift in swi to winter months and water storage limitations which are discussed further in section 4 1 3 2 budyko analysis of water partitioning under the warming simulation et p increased less than expected from budyko s function and therefore decreases in q p were less than expected as well table 4 et p did not increase at the level expected from budyko because swi shifted earlier in the year a changed that was associated with warming this change caused winter seasonal increases in q which offset the overall annual decrease in q according to the budyko hypothesis the expected annual average runoff ratio under warming conditions based on the aridity index calculated from the warming simulation pet p 2 85 was 0 073 the catchment instead experienced an annual average runoff ratio of 0 12 indicating a 4 7 increase in streamflow i e 0 12 0 073 associated with the shift in swi timing examining the monthly budyko comparisons illustrated how the modeled water partitioning changed due to warming and changes in swi timing in this respect fig 7 shows that under warming winter months blue stars and early spring months march april green stars plot further below the budyko curve than the corresponding control simulation winter months blue circles spring months green circles because this time period is primarily energy limited the increased swi exhibited relatively lower partitioning to et and greater partitioning to streamflow than expected by budyko the reductions in et partitioning relative to budyko are also seen in the water limited summer months fig 7 red stars versus corresponding red circles this occurred because shifts toward earlier swi in previous months increased water limitations with respect to summer et the combined effects of decreased et partitioning relative to budyko in both winter to early spring months and in summer months resulted in an overall reduction in annual et partitioning relative to the budyko expectation importantly one would not expect this type of warming response for a rain dominated system because shifts in swi timing would not occur in any month in fig 8a d we show both the raw values and the changes across the control and warming simulations as a difference value in average monthly et p fig 8a and swi fig 8b to further evaluate the mechanistic impact swi has on catchment hydrologic partitioning in the warming simulation et p increases in winter and early spring months and decreases in summer months fig 8c these changes coincide with water availability or lack of in the form of swi in the warming simulation increased swi is generated in winter months due to more rainfall and earlier snowmelt events which caused decreased swi in later months i e march fig 8d similarly the notable decrease in swi in march in the warming simulation explains the subsequent decreased et p in june because water limitations in june are enhanced by the shift toward earlier swi lastly the notable increases in swi under warming conditions are seen in the average monthly differences in swi in december and february the change in january swi is less dramatic as swi was generally low in the four represented years averaged in fig 8b and january was likely less sensitive to warming than december and february as it is climatologically the coldest month in this catchment 4 discussion 4 1 assumptions and limitations 4 1 1 precipitation we limited our warming perturbations to air temperature relative humidity and incoming longwave radiation by amounts shown in fig 2 across the control and warming simulations we held historical precipitation constant allowing precipitation amount to change would have eliminated a means of deciphering how changes in swi impact et and q as changes in precipitation would have also impacted partitioning brooks et al 2015 kalra and ahmad 2011 wang and alimohammadi 2012 holding p constant in the warming simulation likely created amplified water limitations in the summertime where we saw monthly decreases in et p a number of studies have highlighted uncertainties in future precipitation by end of current century across the western u s liu et al 2017 estimated increases in wintertime precipitation between 40 and 70 with greater increases expected in high elevation mountainous regions changes in precipitation during the summer season are less defined and more variable kittel et al 2015 showed that historical precipitation trends on the front range of colorado 1952 to 2010 are unclear as precipitation increased approximately 60 mm per decade at an alpine site 3739 m but showed no trend at a nearby subalpine site 3022 m they suggested that precipitation variability is more strongly associated with decadal variability as both warm and wet and warm and dry periods will occur in the future in the greater upper colorado river basin end of current century precipitation projections are equally unclear with predictions ranging from a 60 decline at lower elevations to as much as a 74 increase at high elevations christensen et al 2004 group et al 2015 kopytkovskiya et al 2015 miller et al 2014 minder et al 2017 using this information we posit that if the wintertime precipitation were to fall as snow but snowmelt still occurred earlier due to simulated warming this seasonal increase in precipitation would reinforce our finding regarding a buffering effect associated with a shift in the timing of swi and associated increases in winter q the same result would occur if the future increased wintertime precipitation were to fall as rain as swi would be generated immediately in the colder months when pet is relatively low partitioning more swi to q increasing winter season runoff and buffering overall annual decreases in q precipitation increases in the future could alleviate catchment water limitations and therefore the summer decreases in et p noted herein may not be applicable to scenarios of increased precipitation irrespective of potential precipitation trends first principles determine that a shift in swi will occur with warming and thus the buffering concept revealed here would remain evident in addition predictions of future precipitation are highly uncertain and therefore limiting our study to the more certain projections of increased temperature allows for a more tractable scope in our analyses lastly the scale and accuracy of precipitation forcing data may have dramatic impacts on streamflow simulations in particular extreme peaks even at smaller catchment scales spatial variability of precipitation has been shown to translate into large variations in modeled runoff faurès et al 1995 goodrich et al 1995 thus in fig 4 where the model is unable to accurately capture the runoff peaks observed in gordon gulch could be the result of precipitation variability across the catchment that was not represented in the modeled forcing data this limitation may be improved with high resolution precipitation data and or including a longer simulation period which may enhance the model calibration process 4 1 2 storage additional stationarity was assumed across control and warming model simulations in soil and vegetation parameters dhsvm was initially optimized in the control simulation to the historic streamflow record and we assumed that those parameters which influence sub surface flow and storage were transferrable to the future warming simulation it is likely that these parameters will change in the next century introducing a limitation to the methodology used in this work however changes in soil properties in particular are likely to occur more rapidly in time under future warming to soils high in organic matter which are less common in colorado front range which are low in organic matter karmakar et al 2016 further in both simulations stomatal minimum resistance remains the same throughout one water year kaufmann 1982 wigmosta et al 1994 which is not always accurate in a forested area irmak and mutiibwa 2009 next by evaluating hydrologic partitioning with a monthly scale budyko analysis our evaluation of hydrologic storage within gordon gulch across months is relative i e we focus on the change in general behavior between simulations because the budyko framework is based on long term observations the prediction of an evaporative index from a given aridity index does not consider carry over in water availability i e storage from month to month thus when evaluating hydrologic partitioning on a monthly timescale et p can exceed a value of 1 as seen in fig 7 and in previous works using the budyko framework on a shortened monthly timeframe du et al 2016 2014 yokoo et al 2008 zhang et al 2008 du et al 2016 address this exceedance by parameterizing water supply as precipitation in addition to root zone water storage change thus because we do not explicitly quantify root zone water storage change in our analysis we instead assess monthly hydrologic partitioning as relative between our two model simulations where our results suggest general catchment behavioral differences between a control and warming scenario however water storage in the root zone and water table i e soil and sub surface storage can impact the monthly budyko values by increasing et from stored water in the soil and vegetation in months where p may be low e g control simulation summer months in fig 7 when et exceeds p subsequently once root zone storage is depleted in the semi arid environment et will significantly decrease despite any p input as there is no remaining water e g control simulation fall months in fig 7 when et p again drops below 1 4 1 3 model uncertainties there are inherent uncertainties in the dhsvm simulations associated with model forcings parameters and model structure fixed and unfixed parameters attempt to represent an intricate and dramatic landscape and capture environmental micro dynamics and interactions however each parameter introduces an assumption about the landscape where observations are often lacking stewart et al 2017 wigmosta et al 1994 du et al 2014 zhao et al 2009 this was particularly true with soil parameters where porosity and field capacity are often poorly known across any given catchment the representation of the water table bedrock interface within the model where impermeable bedrock underlies the water table wigmosta et al 1994 also poses a limitation as it simplifies the underlying structure present in gordon gulch where deep groundwater flow contributes to runoff the streamflow record of gordon gulch also posed limitations to our study where only three years were available for analysis and model parameter estimation owing to the relatively small catchment area 2 6 km2 and semi arid climate 520 mm annual precipitation the streamflow volumes in gordon gulch are relatively small and are highly variable e g 2011 was highly snow dominated snow fraction 0 53 whereas 2012 was dominated by summer rainfall snow fraction 0 39 given these small and variable fluxes capturing the temporal variability of streamflow within any hydrologic model is challenging 4 2 implications previous works have suggested that regions with greater proportional snowfall versus rainfall have relatively greater streamflow berghuijs et al 2014 klos et al 2014 such differences across catchments have been attributed to groundwater dynamics and the catchment drainage rate safeeq et al 2013 tague and grant 2009 as well as the rate of snowmelt barnhart et al 2016 as warming shifts surface water inputs from snowfall to rainfall and causes earlier snowmelt and peak runoff tennant et al 2015 runoff ratios will decrease follum et al 2019 livneh and badger 2020 zhang et al 2018 yet missing from these preceding assessments of snowmelt driven changes in streamflow under warming has been an in depth analysis of how the timing of surface water inputs will change and how this change will impact streamflow generation the analyses presented herein address this knowledge gap by estimating future changes in hydrologic partitioning associated with an alteration of surface water input seasonality the shift in swi caused a 15 increase in winter streamflow which acts as a relative buffer to the 22 annual loss in modeled streamflow the resulting overall decrease in annual streamflow with seasonal increases in winter streamflow presented here is complementary to several previous studies imposing warming conditions on historical records both christensen et al 2004 and mccabe and wolock 2016 estimated an end of 20th century annual decrease in streamflow of 17 in the colorado river basin christensen and lettenmaier 2006 2007 estimated an end of century annual decrease in streamflow of 8 11 across the colorado river basin the entirety of western north america is projected by climate model ensembles and the variable infiltration capacity vic model to experience an annual decrease in runoff of 10 30 by 2050 christensen and lettenmaier 2006 2007 milly et al 2005 seasonally hamlet and lettenmaier 1999 using the vic model across the western united states saw overall decreases in streamflow but with wintertime increases up to 50 due to increased precipitation while our results fit within the range of annual streamflow projections these previous studies leave a need to determine the mechanism for the associated hydrologic changes related to changes in the timing of swi generation past sub seasonal analyses of hydrologic sensitivity to climate warming have the potential to reveal mechanisms for streamflow change for example foster et al 2016 evaluated catchment increases in et and precipitation phase change at two mountainous locations in colorado and determined that an increase in et created larger decreases in q compared to precipitation phase changes suggesting that increases in et primarily drive decreases in q in this study winter and spring increases in rainfall fraction and earlier snowmelt events resulted in increased swi and associated increases in seasonal streamflow it is also possible that winter and spring swi increases will recharge groundwater that can support the et of deep rooted vegetation streamflow later in the season or groundwater export from the catchment analyses using the budyko framework revealed a smaller increase in evaporative index i e et p than expected under a warming scenario table 4 fig 7 yellow points stars green points stars in this respect the anomaly from the budyko curve increased with warming resulting in a larger runoff ratio than that expected based on the budyko hypothesis as swi shifted toward winter months when atmospheric water demand was relatively low q p increased such sensitivity of the water balance to the seasonality of climate is consistent with nasta et al 2020 and milly s supply demand storage model demonstrating that when p seasonality and pet seasonality are in phase catchments will experience a higher et p ratio than when p seasonality and pet seasonality are out of phase milly 1994a b nasta et al 2020 williams et al 2012 temporal differences in the seasonal timing of rainfall caused up to a 20 difference in et p where a longer wetter season more rainfall in the winter and spring months caused a lower et p and conversely greater q p and a departure below the budyko curve nasta et al 2020 within a simulated warming climate streamflow was sensitive to both increased pet and changes in swi timing where increased pet acted to decrease q but earlier swi acted to increase q swi increased in the winter months when pet was relatively low decoupling catchment water supply i e swi and atmospheric water demand i e pet and increasing winter streamflow under warming conditions annual mean streamflow still decreased overall but increased in winter demonstrating how the original presence of snow in the control simulation buffered and offset the overall decrease in q due to simulated warming this buffering effect of increased wintertime streamflow is specific to snow dominated catchments where buffering of climate sensitivity is associated with shifts in swi timing such sensitivity is buffered until snow longer falls within a catchment as swi produced by solely rainfall timing will not be affected by warming and no seasonal streamflow climate sensitivity buffer will exist 5 conclusions in this analysis the timing of surface water input swi shifted toward earlier in the year due to warming and subsequent decreases in snowfall fraction and earlier snowmelt events as a result average annual winter and early spring streamflow q increased by 15 despite an average annual streamflow decrease of 22 hydrologic partitioning within the catchment shifted toward increased et but less than would be expected within the budyko hypothesis in this regard winter increases in swi resulted in a seasonal increase in annual q relative to the expected value based on budyko these wintertime swi increases caused successive summertime drying which decreased partitioning to et p when there exist seasonal water limitations which were amplified under warming conditions to obtain these results the distributed soil hydrology vegetation model dhsvm was used to simulate a control and warming scenario in a small upper montane catchment in the front range of colorado in order to evaluate solely the effects of swi on q precipitation amount but not phase was held constant and landcover and soil properties were considered stationary across simulations this approach meant that the model results were most informative when relatively compared against one another as opposed to presented as absolute transferrable values a future study may evaluate annual and seasonal swi and q in a non stationary scenario where the isolated effect of each variable on q would need to be identified in order to create a meaningful swi q relationship we predict that by first principles the increased winter season q as a result of increased swi from earlier snowmelt would remain overall the winter spring streamflow increases and increased q p in budyko space represent a buffering effect with respect to hydrologic sensitivity to climate change that is specific to snow dominated catchments as climate warming continues losses in snow cover may exceed a threshold in which snowmelt becomes an insignificant hydrologic driver and this seasonal streamflow buffering effect will no longer exist thus the findings here represent an expected hydrologic response in near future conditions within the colorado front range whereby subsequent responses may reflect more rain dominated conditions critically the temporal distribution of swi generation and future changes will change where and when water resources will arrive downstream influencing the reliant surrounding ecosystems
