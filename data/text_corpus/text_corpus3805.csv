population and upstream versus downstream in five of the six rivers level of statistical significance was set at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 virus detection in rivers by qpcr and factors affecting virus occurrence all seven viruses were detected in at least one water sample collected from alberta rivers during the 12 month sampling period except for milk river table 1 three viruses including rotavirus adenovirus and jc virus were detected in milk river which is the southern most river in the study whose watershed is primarily natural grasslands with 10 000 residents bow river downstream of the city of calgary alberta s largest city with a population density of 104 km2 had the highest positive detection rates and highest median concentrations of viruses followed by the north saskatchewan river downstream of the city of edmonton population density 76 km2 and red deer river downstream of the city of red deer population density 19 km2 tables 1 and 2 overall among the total 180 samples collected from 6 rivers rotavirus was the most frequently detected virus 87 followed by adenovirus 44 and norovirus 36 besides milk river with only one collection site the detection rates of the seven viruses along 5 rivers were generally higher at the collection sites downstream of the major urban centers compared to the upstream sites table 1 detection rates of the three most frequently detected viruses rotaviruses adenoviruses and noroviruses varied by latitude and population with the highest positive detection observed at latitude 51 where bow river is located p 0 001 table 2 detection rates of these three viruses were significantly higher downstream as compared to upstream of the urban centers p 0 05 the concentration of viruses was higher in samples collected from downstream sites as compared to upstream sites but the difference was only significant for rotavirus p 0 001 table 2 norovirus sapovirus astrovirus adenovirus enterovirus and jc virus had higher detection rates and concentration from november to march which are the winter months in alberta fig 2 the viral concentration was greater than 3 log10 ge copies l in more than 50 of the samples for norovirus rotavirus and sapovirus the detection of norovirus and adenovirus was associated with higher estimated population size of the watersheds p 0 05 and p 0 001 respectively an association was observed between the concentration of adenovirus in the water samples and population size p 0 001 table 2 latitude and population size by watershed of each river were identified to be confounding variables population size and upstream versus downstream were significant factors associated with the detection of norovirus and adenovirus p 0 05 and 0 01 table 2 but not for rotavirus 3 2 infectious

icc qpcr detected viruses in 19 180 11 samples reovirus was the most common virus detected presented in 4 rivers except bow and milk rivers enterovirus was detected in 2 samples from bow river and adenovirus was detected in one sample from north saskatchewan river rotavirus was not detected by icc qpcr in any samples infectious viruses were mainly detected from sites located downstream of major urban centers during the winter november to march seven samples showed cpe without any viruses identified by icc qpcr however infectious viruses were detected in 11 samples by icc qpcr without cpe observed table 3 3 3 sources of rotavirus based on genotyping rotavirus g typing was successful in all 20 samples and used for identification of rotavirus sources the g typing sequences showed that 75 of rotavirus positive samples from downstream sites were human rotavirus strains along the five alberta rivers in contrast only 37 of the rotavirus positive samples from upstream sites were derived from human which was significantly lower than that from downstream sites p 0 02 the most common genotype of human rotavirus was g1 8 12 majority of the rotavirus positive samples 63 from upstream sites were bovine strains including bovine g6 4 8 and g8 1 8 bovine rotavirus g6 2 8 and g10 1 8 were also identified in positive samples from downstream sites nucleotide identifications of rotavirus

accounts for the source of drinking water for 75 of the canadian population but also is important for livestock and crop production and wildlife in recent years endemic acute gastrointestinal illness associated with human viruses has increased considerably contaminated food or water is one of the major transmission pathways for enteric viruses murphy et al 2016 the risk of infection from consuming virus contaminated drinking water is 10 10 000 times greater than that contaminated with pathogenic bacteria at a similar level of exposure haas et al 1993 prevalence of human enteric viruses in surface water was reported around the world lodder and de roda husman 2005 gibson and schwab 2011 edge et al 2013 however most of these studies focused on monitoring human viruses in one river and or its tributaries prevost et al 2015 marie and lin 2017 in this study prevalence of 7 human viruses was investigated in six major rivers in alberta for one year period these six rivers span geographically from south to north of the province latitude from 49 to 55 with various topographic characteristics and flow through several cities with different populations in its watershed this allowed us 1 to study influences of human and livestock activities and geographic location of rivers on occurrence of viruses in river water 2 to determine monthly variations in the occurrence and number of viruses and 3 to identify potential risks associated with viral contaminations in river additionally this study provides a baseline for future full scale risk assessment and source tracking of viral gastroenteritis in the regions using our established database of gastroenteritis outbreak investigation human enteric viruses were found in all six rivers in alberta overall rotavirus and adenovirus were the most abundant viruses detected in samples followed by astrovirus norovirus and sapovirus enterovirus and jc virus occurred less often at lower levels compared to other viruses these results agreed with a large scale study involving a complex hydrographic network of the negro river surrounding the city of manaus in amazonas state miagostovich et al 2008 however the prevalence of enteric viruses in rivers varied in different studies mackowiak et al 2018 reported that human adenovirus was most frequently detected 87 5 followed by enterovirus 20 8 in an urban river in germany while the detection rate of rotavirus was only 16 7 similar results were found in umgeni river in durban region of south africa lin and singh 2015 vieira et al 2016 observed that of 272 samples analyzed human adenovirus was most frequently detected 91 9 followed by jc virus 69 5 rotavirus 23 9 and norovirus gii 7 4 in the negro river in brazil vieira et al 2016 d ugo et al 2016 reported that norovirus reovirus and adenoviruses were the most frequently identified enteric viruses after ms2 bacteriophage in the sampled surface waters from several european countries in a one year study from norway and japan norovirus gi gii and enteric adenovirus were more frequently detected in surface water and the tone river in tokyo respectively kishida et al 2012 grondahl rosado et al 2014 although there may be slight differences in the qpcr methods for detection of enteric viruses in these studies it seems rotavirus and adenovirus were the most frequently detected enteric viruses in rivers using the glowpa model for rotavirus the estimated global distribution of rotavirus emission to surface water was 2 1018 viral particles grid year of which 87 was produced by the urban population with 13 18 reaching surface water kiulia et al 2015 monthly variations in the occurrence of viruses in river water were observed the detection rate and concentration of norovirus adenovirus astrovirus sapovirus and jc virus increased substantially during winter months november to march most viral gastroenteritis outbreaks occur from november to march period in alberta hasing et al 2013 which coincides with the peak occurrence of norovirus in river waters our previous studies have demonstrated that human enteric viruses were responsible for 80 gastroenteritis outbreaks and norovirus accounted for up to 70 of all outbreaks in alberta pang et al 2010 norovirus associated gastroenteritis likely increased viral contamination of river water and could conceivably result in increased disease transmission a high percentage of human adenovirus occurrence 76 4 was reported during the winter tao et al 2016 suggesting that human enteric viruses persist longer in the environment during winter conditions i e low temperature less precipitations and the minimal discharge rate of rivers in a year tani et al 1995 the prevalence of rotavirus was high throughout the year with little monthly variation the high occurrence of rotavirus downstream of major urban centers suggests that rotavirus is most likely derived from human sources sequence analyses indicated that human sources account for most rotaviruses 75 downstream of urban centers while upstream rotaviruses are primarily from bovine 63 although rotavirus associated human sporadic gastroenteritis was frequently observed in winter spring season pang et al 2014 the occurrence of rotaviruses did not peak during the winter season one possible explanation is that qpcr assay used in this study could detect both human and animal sourced rotaviruses others have shown the occurrence of viruses to be more frequent in downstream sites than upstream in corresponding rivers marcheggiani et al 2015 the high positive detection rates and increased concentrations of viruses in downstream sites suggested an association or influence of human population growth and watershed disturbance on the prevalence of viruses in the environment prevost et al 2015 in this study multivariate binary regression analysis showed that river watershed population influenced the frequency of detection and mean concentrations of enteric viruses in rivers the bow north saskatchewan and red deer river s catchments include the three largest urban centers in alberta with population around 1 4 1 3 and 0 1 million respectively these watersheds also contain significant livestock operations including small low intensity farms and concentrated animal feeding operations in alberta the prevalence of rotavirus adenovirus and norovirus was the highest in corresponding rivers in terms of both positive detection frequencies and median concentrations of these viruses the main source of enteric virus contamination in rivers is considered to be fecal matter enteric viruses are excreted in large numbers in the feces of infected persons over 1 trillion virus particles g of feces bosch et al 2008 viruses are easily spread in the environment and are transported into surface waters by runoff fecal contamination of rivers can occur through various routes in which wwtp effluent was likely a primary source kitajima et al 2014 prevost et al 2015 reported that the viral load and the detection frequency of enteric viruses increased significantly between the samples collected from the most upstream and the most downstream of paris urban area clearly indicating a measurable impact of wwtp effluents on contamination of the seine river bradbury et al 2013 reported relatively high concentrations of human enteric viruses in sewage ranging from 1 3 104 to 3 6 107 ge copies l the presence of human enteric viruses in post treatment wastewater was reported recently two log reduction of viruses could be achieved with secondary treatment rotavirus was highly resistant to chlorine and uv treatment with 38 and 25 positive detections remaining in wastewater effluents qiu et al 2015 these findings are consistent with other studies sedmak et al 2005 he et al 2011 simmons et al 2011 highlighting that treated wastewater discharge could contaminate rivers and other surface waters as a predominant source of human viral contaminants in this study median concentration of adenovirus varied among the 6 river watersheds and correlated significantly p 0 001 with population size this observation implied that adenovirus detected in alberta rivers may most likely be from human sources farming and livestock production may also play a role in the contamination of rivers with enteric viruses animal specific viruses are generally not transmissible to humans cattle manure contains some rotaviruses and adenoviruses that are different from human strains 63 of rotavirus positive samples from upstream sites of major urban centers were animal strains with g6 as the main genotypes of bovine rotaviruses in contrast the percentage of human rotavirus significantly increased in downstream of major urban centers indicating an impact of human influence on viral contamination of river waters alberta s climate is continental with generally warm summers and cold winters however due to its large geographic area 661 848 km2 the province has several distinct eco regions with respect to physiography soil type precipitation vegetation fauna and resulting land use characteristics see supplementary materials in addition day length and daily temperatures vary with latitude in this study the detection rate of rotavirus norovirus and adenovirus differed significantly with latitude p 0 001 the highest detection rate was on bow river located at latitude 51 although the frequency of detection was higher in the south the two most southerly rivers milk and oldman rivers at latitude 49 had lower detection rates and levels for adenovirus and norovirus compared to rivers further north one possible explanation is that population density in the milk and oldman river s watersheds are relatively low 210 000 in total indicating that watershed latitude and population are confounding factors for occurrence of viruses in rivers although multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that geographic location of rivers at given latitude might be a contributing factor we can t draw a solid conclusion by this study since populations in corresponding watersheds were the most influential factor associated with viral contamination of rivers in alberta 14 of samples were cell culture and or icc pcr positive and 73 of viral positive samples were identified by icc pcr as reovirus enterovirus and adenovirus enterovirus and adenovirus were human strains while reovirus could derive from human or animals most of culture and or icc pcr positive samples were collected from downstream sampling sites of major urban centers viral culture icc qpcr provides evidence of the presence of infectious viruses in river water those viruses could be transmitted via drinking or recreational use of contaminated water which may cause acute gastroenteritis and outbreaks almost 50 of samples with infectious viruses detected were collected during winter which is coincident with endemic seasonal peaks of viral gastroenteritis since not all of human enteric viruses are culturable the results imply that human enteric viruses with infectivity are likely being underestimated in surface waters using currently available detection and identification methods the potential risk of human enteric viruses to public health is probably greater than indicated by this study soller et al 2017 due to the lack of data on the numbers of septic systems holding tanks and concentrated or individual livestock operations in each river watershed we are unable to do source tracking of viral contamination in alberta rivers and full scale risk assessments further investigation and source tracking of enteric viruses associated with acute gastroenteritis is necessary the assessment of pathogenic bacteria was not integrated into this study it has been emphasized in literature that bacterial indicators do not correlate well with presence of enteric viruses in water who water safety plan highly recommends routine monitoring of both viruses and bacteria for raw and drinking water therefore comprehensively assessing the spectrum of microbiological pathogens in major rivers of alberta will provide insights for better management of microbiological pathogens in surface water 5 conclusions this study indicates that high occurrence and levels of enteric viruses in alberta rivers was mainly associated with human population in large urban centers in corresponding watersheds and the major source of viral contamination is most likely derived from sewage and wastewater treatment plants seasonal coincidence of acute viral gastroenteritis outbreaks with the peak occurrence of human enteric viruses in alberta rivers implies potential impact of viral contaminants in river water on human health direct association of viral gastroenteritis with enteric viruses in water and source tracking of viral infection will be further investigated acknowledgements we thank

of the city of calgary alberta s largest city with a population density of 104 km2 had the highest positive detection rates and highest median concentrations of viruses followed by the north saskatchewan river downstream of the city of edmonton population density 76 km2 and red deer river downstream of the city of red deer population density 19 km2 tables 1 and 2 overall among the total 180 samples collected from 6 rivers rotavirus was the most frequently detected virus 87 followed by adenovirus 44 and norovirus 36 besides milk river with only one collection site the detection rates of the seven viruses along 5 rivers were generally higher at the collection sites downstream of the major urban centers compared to the upstream sites table 1 detection rates of the three most frequently detected viruses rotaviruses adenoviruses and noroviruses varied by latitude and population with the highest positive detection observed at latitude 51 where bow river is located p 0 001 table 2 detection rates of these three viruses were significantly higher downstream as compared to upstream of the urban centers p 0 05 the concentration of viruses was higher in samples collected from downstream sites as compared to upstream sites but the difference was only significant for rotavirus p 0 001 table 2 norovirus sapovirus astrovirus adenovirus enterovirus and jc virus had higher detection rates and concentration from november to march which are the winter months in alberta fig 2 the viral concentration was greater than 3 log10 ge copies l in more than 50 of the samples for norovirus rotavirus and sapovirus the detection of norovirus and adenovirus was associated with higher estimated population size of the watersheds p 0 05 and p 0 001 respectively an association was observed between the concentration of adenovirus in the water samples and population size p 0 001 table 2 latitude and population size by watershed of each river were identified to be confounding variables population size and upstream versus downstream were significant factors associated with the detection of norovirus and adenovirus p 0 05 and 0 01 table 2 but not for rotavirus 3 2 infectious virus detected in river water by cell culture and icc qpcr infectious viruses were detected in 26 180 14 water samples using cell culture or icc qpcr table 3 cpe was observed in 15 180 8 samples and icc qpcr detected viruses in 19 180 11 samples reovirus was the most common virus detected presented in 4 rivers except bow and milk rivers enterovirus was detected in 2 samples from bow river and adenovirus was detected in one sample from north saskatchewan river rotavirus was not detected by icc qpcr in any samples infectious viruses were mainly detected from sites located downstream of major urban centers during the winter november to march seven samples showed cpe without any viruses identified by icc qpcr however infectious viruses were detected in 11 samples by icc qpcr without cpe observed table 3 3 3 sources of rotavirus based on genotyping rotavirus g typing was successful in all 20 samples and used for identification of rotavirus sources the g typing sequences showed that 75 of rotavirus positive samples from downstream sites were human rotavirus strains along the five alberta rivers in contrast only 37 of the rotavirus positive samples from upstream sites were derived from human which was significantly lower than that from downstream sites p 0 02 the most common genotype of human rotavirus was g1 8 12 majority of the rotavirus positive samples 63 from upstream sites were bovine strains including bovine g6 4 8 and g8 1 8 bovine rotavirus g6 2 8 and g10 1 8 were also identified in positive samples from downstream sites nucleotide identifications of rotavirus g genotypes were included in supplementary materials 4 discussion source water contamination with human enteric viruses has drawn attention to public health and food safety surface water not only accounts for the source of drinking water for 75 of the canadian population but also is important for livestock and crop production and wildlife in recent years endemic acute gastrointestinal illness associated with human viruses has increased considerably contaminated food or water is one of the major transmission pathways for enteric viruses murphy et al 2016 the risk of infection from consuming virus contaminated drinking water is 10 10 000 times greater than that contaminated with pathogenic bacteria at a similar level of exposure haas et al 1993 prevalence of human enteric viruses in surface water was reported around the world lodder and de roda husman 2005 gibson and schwab 2011 edge et al 2013 however most of these studies focused on monitoring human viruses in one river and or its tributaries prevost et al 2015 marie and lin 2017 in this study prevalence of 7 human viruses was investigated in six major rivers in alberta for one year period these six rivers span geographically from south to north of the province latitude from 49 to 55 with various topographic characteristics and flow through several cities with different populations in its watershed this allowed us 1 to study influences of human and livestock activities and geographic location of rivers on occurrence of viruses in river water 2 to determine monthly variations in the occurrence and number of viruses and 3 to identify potential risks associated with viral contaminations in river additionally this study provides a baseline for future full scale risk assessment and source tracking of viral gastroenteritis in the regions using our established database of gastroenteritis outbreak investigation human enteric viruses were found in all six rivers in alberta overall rotavirus and adenovirus were the most abundant viruses detected in samples followed by astrovirus norovirus and sapovirus enterovirus and jc virus occurred less often at lower levels compared to other viruses these results agreed with a large scale study involving a complex hydrographic network of the negro river surrounding the city of manaus in amazonas state miagostovich et al 2008 however the prevalence of enteric viruses in rivers varied in different studies mackowiak et al 2018 reported that human adenovirus was most frequently detected 87 5 followed by enterovirus 20 8 in an urban river in germany while the detection rate of rotavirus was only 16 7 similar results were found in umgeni river in durban region of south africa lin and singh 2015 vieira et al 2016 observed that of 272 samples analyzed human adenovirus was most frequently detected 91 9 followed by jc virus 69 5 rotavirus 23 9 and norovirus gii 7 4 in the negro river in brazil vieira et al 2016 d ugo et al 2016 reported that norovirus reovirus and adenoviruses were the most frequently identified enteric viruses after ms2 bacteriophage in the sampled surface waters from several european countries in a one year study from norway and japan norovirus gi gii and enteric adenovirus were more frequently detected in surface water and the tone river in tokyo respectively kishida et al 2012 grondahl rosado et al 2014 although there may be slight differences in the qpcr methods for detection of enteric viruses in these studies it seems rotavirus and adenovirus were the most frequently detected enteric viruses in rivers using the glowpa model for rotavirus the estimated global distribution of rotavirus emission to surface water was 2 1018 viral particles grid year of which 87 was produced by the urban population with 13 18 reaching surface water kiulia et al 2015 monthly variations in the occurrence of viruses in river water were observed the detection rate and concentration of norovirus adenovirus astrovirus sapovirus and jc virus increased substantially during winter months november to march most viral gastroenteritis outbreaks occur from november to march period in alberta hasing et al 2013 which coincides with the peak occurrence of norovirus in river waters our previous studies have demonstrated that human enteric viruses were responsible for 80 gastroenteritis outbreaks and norovirus accounted for up to 70 of all outbreaks in alberta pang et al 2010 norovirus associated gastroenteritis likely increased viral contamination of river water and could conceivably result in increased disease transmission a high percentage of human adenovirus occurrence 76 4 was reported during the winter tao et al 2016 suggesting that human enteric viruses persist longer in the environment during winter conditions i e low temperature less precipitations and the minimal discharge rate of rivers in a year tani et al 1995 the prevalence of rotavirus was high throughout the year with little monthly variation the high occurrence of rotavirus downstream of major urban centers suggests that rotavirus is most likely derived from human sources sequence analyses indicated that human sources account for most rotaviruses 75 downstream of urban centers while upstream rotaviruses are primarily from bovine 63 although rotavirus associated human sporadic gastroenteritis was frequently observed in winter spring season pang et al 2014 the occurrence of rotaviruses did not peak during the winter season one possible explanation is that qpcr assay used in this study could detect both human and animal sourced rotaviruses others have shown the occurrence of viruses to be more frequent in downstream sites than upstream in corresponding rivers marcheggiani et al 2015 the high positive detection rates and increased concentrations of viruses in downstream sites suggested an association or influence of human population growth and watershed disturbance on the prevalence of viruses in the environment prevost et al 2015 in this study multivariate binary regression analysis showed that river watershed population influenced the frequency of detection and mean concentrations of enteric viruses in rivers the bow north saskatchewan and red deer river s catchments include the three largest urban centers in alberta with population around 1 4 1 3 and 0 1 million respectively these watersheds also contain significant livestock operations including small low intensity farms and concentrated animal feeding operations in alberta the prevalence of rotavirus adenovirus and norovirus was the highest in corresponding rivers in terms of both positive detection frequencies and median concentrations of these viruses the main source of enteric virus contamination in rivers is considered to be fecal matter enteric viruses are excreted in large numbers in the feces of infected persons over 1 trillion virus particles g of feces bosch et al 2008 viruses are easily spread in the environment and are transported into surface waters by runoff fecal contamination of rivers can occur through various routes in which wwtp effluent was likely a primary source kitajima et al 2014 prevost et al 2015 reported that the viral load and the detection frequency of enteric viruses increased significantly between the samples collected from the most upstream and the most downstream of paris urban area clearly indicating a measurable impact of wwtp effluents on contamination of the seine river bradbury et al 2013 reported relatively high concentrations of human enteric viruses in sewage ranging from 1 3 104 to 3 6 107 ge copies l the presence of human enteric viruses in post treatment wastewater was reported recently two log reduction of viruses could be achieved with secondary treatment rotavirus was highly resistant to chlorine and uv treatment with 38 and 25 positive detections remaining in wastewater effluents qiu et al 2015 these findings are consistent with other studies sedmak et al 2005 he et al 2011 simmons et al 2011 highlighting that treated wastewater discharge could contaminate rivers and other surface waters as a predominant source of human viral contaminants in this study median concentration of adenovirus varied among the 6 river watersheds and correlated significantly p 0 001 with population size this observation implied that adenovirus detected in alberta rivers may most likely be from human sources farming and livestock production may also play a role in the contamination of rivers with enteric viruses animal specific viruses are generally not transmissible to humans cattle manure contains some rotaviruses and adenoviruses that are different from human strains 63 of rotavirus positive samples from upstream sites of major urban centers were animal strains with g6 as the main genotypes of bovine rotaviruses in contrast the percentage of human rotavirus significantly increased in downstream of major urban centers indicating an impact of human influence on viral contamination of river waters alberta s climate is continental with generally warm summers and cold winters however due to its large geographic area 661 848 km2 the province has several distinct eco regions with respect to physiography soil type precipitation vegetation fauna and resulting land use characteristics see supplementary materials in addition day length and daily temperatures vary with latitude in this study the detection rate of rotavirus norovirus and adenovirus differed significantly with latitude p 0 001 the highest detection rate was on bow river located at latitude 51 although the frequency of detection was higher in the south the two most southerly rivers milk and oldman rivers at latitude 49 had lower detection rates and levels for adenovirus and norovirus compared to rivers further north one possible explanation is that population density in the milk and oldman river s watersheds are relatively low 210 000 in total indicating that watershed latitude and population are confounding factors for occurrence of viruses in rivers although multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that geographic location of rivers at given latitude might be a contributing factor we can t draw a solid conclusion by this study since populations in corresponding watersheds were the most influential factor associated with viral contamination of rivers in alberta 14 of samples were cell culture and or icc pcr positive and 73 of viral positive samples were identified by icc pcr as reovirus enterovirus and adenovirus enterovirus and adenovirus were human strains while reovirus could derive from human or animals most of culture and or icc pcr positive samples were collected from downstream sampling sites of major urban centers viral culture icc qpcr provides evidence of the presence of infectious viruses in river water those viruses could be transmitted via drinking or recreational use of contaminated water which may cause acute gastroenteritis and outbreaks almost 50 of samples with infectious viruses detected were collected during winter which is coincident with endemic seasonal peaks of viral gastroenteritis since not all of human enteric viruses are culturable the results imply that human enteric viruses with infectivity are likely being underestimated in surface waters using currently available detection and identification methods the potential risk of human enteric viruses to public health is probably greater than indicated by this study soller et al 2017 due to the lack of data on the numbers of septic systems holding tanks and concentrated or individual livestock operations in each river watershed we are unable to do source tracking of viral contamination in alberta rivers and full scale risk assessments further investigation and source tracking of enteric viruses associated with acute gastroenteritis is necessary the assessment of pathogenic bacteria was not integrated into this study it has been emphasized in literature that bacterial indicators do not correlate well with presence of enteric viruses in water who water safety plan highly recommends routine monitoring of both viruses and bacteria for raw and drinking water therefore comprehensively assessing the spectrum of microbiological pathogens in major rivers of alberta will provide insights for better management of microbiological pathogens in surface water 5 conclusions this study indicates that high occurrence and levels of enteric viruses in alberta rivers was mainly associated with human population in large urban centers in corresponding watersheds and the major source of viral contamination is most likely derived from sewage and wastewater treatment plants seasonal coincidence of acute viral gastroenteritis outbreaks with the peak occurrence of human enteric viruses in alberta rivers implies potential impact of viral contaminants in river water on human health direct association of viral gastroenteritis with enteric viruses in water and source tracking of viral infection will be further investigated acknowledgements we thank

19026,the monitoring and control of drinking water quality is generally important as it significantly contributes to the health of the population in this context particular attention has to be paid to the use of treatment techniques during drinking water treatment it is known that the formation of reaction products transformation products has to be taken into account when oxidizing agents such as ozone are used different transformation products are classified as critical to health and require analytical examination the risk assessment for previously unknown transformation products can be difficult as far as not all transformation products are present as single substances or the individual substances are not present in a sufficient high concentration or cannot be isolated from the original solution the aim of this work is to show exemplarily the identification and quantification of ozonation products ops after ozonation and their toxicological characterization using the artificial sweetener acesulfame it was shown that ops can be fully characterized using ion chromatography in combination with different detection systems a major op could be recovered as a pure substance by crystallization and direct genotoxicological testing was possible without previous enrichment processes acesulfame samples of different concentrations in ultrapure and in drinking water after ozonation were tested in several genotoxicity tests these tests revealed genotoxic effects of acesulfame after ozonation in ultrapure water in several genotoxicological test systems micronucleus test umu test ames fluctuation test and comet assay in contrast the crystallized ozonation product op168 did not show any positive effects therefore it seems likely that the observed effect was caused by the second major product op170 however a sufficiently large amount of analytically pure substance op170 could not be obtained it was also shown that the rate of the op170 formation in drinking water is significantly lower than in ultrapure water and that ozonation in drinking water did not induce genotoxic effects graphical abstract image 1 keywords transformation products ozonation acesulfame risk assessment drinking water germany genotoxicity 1 introduction a widely used method for removing organic trace substances in drinking water treatment is the treatment with ozone in germany at least an amount of 10 of the supplied drinking water is ozonated happel et al 2013 ozone treatment is regarded inter alia as an effective and economically cost effective option for removing undesirable taste and odor as well as organic micropollutants joss et al 2008 in most cases treatment with ozone does not mineralize contaminants but results in the formation of unknown transformation products ops for which a toxicological assessment can be difficult simmons et al 2008 a prediction of the possible occurrence of undesired oxidation products and potentially critical by products is difficult the formation of toxicological critical ops from natural matter or anthropogenic trace substances during water treatment by ozone has been already shown for a biodegradation product of the fungicide tolylfluanide schmidt and brauch 2008 demonstrated that the metabolite n n dimethylsulfamide dms results during ozonation in the formation of n n dimethylnitrosamine ndma involving bromide as an catalytic reactant von gunten et al 2010 recently it was shown that bioassays are suitable tools for the effect based identification of adverse effects of chemicals in water bodies and waste water treatment effluents e g ashauer 2016 di paolo et al 2016 kunz et al 2017 neale et al 2017 valitalo et al 2016 as well as transformation products müller et al 2016 zhu et al 2016 therefore it was recently suggested to include effect based tools within the review process of the european water framework directive brack et al 2017 wernersson et al 2015 water framework directive brack et al 2017 wernersson et al 2015 investigations for a risk assessment on ops after ozonation of drinking water are useful and necessary it helps to prevent the raw water entry of substances which form critical ozonation products during the ozonation the findings obtained with the example ndma in previous studies demonstrated that reactive metabolites may be formed but the toxicological assessment of these metabolites is a complex challenge for the risk assessment practical proximity to the processing processes occurring in the water works is absolutely necessary in order to be able to actually evaluate the corresponding potential risk the test conditions should be as close as possible to reality but sometimes like in the case of ozonated acesulfame ace not all of the diverse ops are stable and separately isolatable for well standardized genotoxicity test systems higher concentrations as they usually occur in aquatic environment are required in order to reach the effective threshold of the test systems grummt et al 2013 the ops of ace generated under realistic conditions during ozonation of drinking water are known and characterized scheurer et al 2012 because of that the ozone experiments for op170 could have been carried out on a preparative scale and no realistic conditions were needed because the real ops are already identified higher amounts of the test substance and ozone concentrations could be used experimentally in order to concentrate specifically certain ops a higher concentration of ozone might cause varying compositions of the ops in addition to ozone and the test substance further organic and inorganic components are present in the water which can influence the ozone reaction ph value temperature amount of carbonate and natural organic matter also influence the reaction these influencing variables which are essentially controlled by the matrix vary from water to water the influence of the matrix was demonstrated depending on which water was used for the experiment studies showed an increased formation of the aldehyde op170 in ultra pure water compared to drinking water the ozone dose the ozone intake and decomposition curve and the reaction time determine the ozone exposure and the molar ratio between the trace substance and the oxidizing agents in practice a trace substance is present only in the ng l to lower μg l range and ozone is added in surplus in the present study this can be disregarded because the ops that occur during ozonation in conventional concentration had already been identified in a previous study and have been confirmed also under realistic condition scheurer et al 2009 this study focuses on a methodological approach to assess the genotoxicological potential of ops in ozonated ultra pure water and drinking water samples in this context it is necessary to consider various aspects of the toxicological assessment for example the threshold of the test system and the stability of the products in the sample toxicity testing of ops formed during oxidative water treatment is difficult in drinking water samples any eventual transformation product usually present in the concentration range between 0 1 μg l and 10 μg l must be enriched by several orders of magnitude because the sensitivity threshold of established genotoxicological test methods usually is several orders above the potential relevant concentration of microcontaminants e g 1 μg l in drinking water samples a concentration step is usually necessary because of the low concentration levels of contaminants in real water samples e g ozonated tap water a direct testing of the drinking water sample might lead to false negative results by not considering the sensitivity of the genotoxicological test systems for standardized genotoxilogical short term tests like the ames test the micronucleus test the comet assay and the umu test a concentration step is necessary and the following aspects have to be considered enrichment of samples by solid phase extraction spe or enrichment by evaporation is not always the most promising way to detect a possible genotoxicity due to the stability of the ops the presence of the ops may not be guaranteed after enrichment the need of an adequate coupling of the enrichment methods with the bioassays is essential in order not to stress the physiological limits of the test organisms and to avoid false positive results e g the tolerance of the test systems to organic solvents another approach is the testing of a highly concentrated treated solution on a laboratory scale ozonation under such high level conditions is not a realistic scenario and artifacts can be a result of the high concentration levels the conditions of the experiment do not correspond to those in the natural environment and the degradation pathway with the corresponding ozonation products can therefore deviate compared to the natural environment the reaction of the substances among each other cannot be excluded and the possible path of altered test substance products has to be clarified on the other hand one advantage of this high level approach is the possibility of producing a true blank sample of the treated water matrix without the test substance but because of these high concentrations the amounts of ozonation products in environmental samples should be known to allow an accurate toxicological assessment transferable onto reality if all ops are available as pure substances or if the individual substances could be enriched to a sufficient concentration level or could be isolated from the original sample the compounds can be tested as a simple individual chemical testing for this approach all ops should be known however in this case no mixed toxicity and their effects of a real sample can be studied the different approaches for a toxicological evaluation of the resulting ops after oxidative treatment raise many questions and gain in importance because of their presence in the environment these three different options for toxicity testing of ops formed during ozonation have been compared in the present study on the example of the artificial sweetener ace ace is a known contaminant of surface waters and of raw water used for drinking water production scheurer et al 2009 scheurer et al 2010 2011 the degradation of ace can vary in the course of time depending on the environmental conditions castronovo et al 2017 the main ozonation products ops of the ace have already been investigated by scheurer et al 2012 acetic acid and op 170 an anionic carboxylic acid and op 168 an aldehyde hydrate were identified as the main ozonation products of ace both ops were structural characterized but not toxicological reviewed 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals chemicals and standards were purchased from the following suppliers acesulfame potassium ammonium bicarbonate sodium acetate sulfamic acid sodium sufate oxalic acid potassium hydroxide glyoxylic acid thionyl chloride potassium formiate dimethyl formamide from sigma aldrich munich germany chemicals for the positive control of the genotoxicological tests 4 nitroquinoline 1 oxide 2 nitrofurantoin and 2 aminoanthracenes were also ordered from sigma aldrich munich germany 2 2 ozonation the ozone stock solution was generated in a bubble column reactor containing 5 l demineralized water an ozone generator ozomat com ad 02 anseros tübingen germany was used to produce ozone from oxygen by dielectric barrier discharge the gas flow was passed through the reactor which was maintained at 5 c the ozone waste of the gas flow was destroyed by a washing bottle containing thiosulfate solution after approximately 1 h an ozone saturation of 20 mg l to 30 mg l was reached in the stock solution as photometrically determined via the extinction of the dye indigotrisulfonate din 38408 3 this stock solution was used for the ozonation of low levels 0 5 mg l and 5 mg l of ace by the batch method the direct intake of ozone gas into a washing bottle v 2000 ml was used for the treatment of samples with high ace concentrations β ace 200 mg l to 5000 mg l a glass tap at the bottom of the bottle enabled the sampling during the ozonation process the ozone concentration in the gas phase before and after the reaction vessel was monitored by absorption of ozone at 254 nm the consumed ozone during the reaction can be calculated by the measured concentrations of both instruments the quantitative reaction of the c c double bond of the ace molecule results in a step of the consumption curve approx after 1 h with a starting amount of ace 2 g l 2 3 preparation of k2 op168 c2h2k2no6s ace 5 g 25 mmol was dissolved in 1000 ml distilled water and treated with ozone gas for 3 h in the wash bottle setup during ozonation the ph of the initially neutral solution decreased significantly to approx ph 3 the resulting reaction solution was concentrated at a rotary evaporator hereby water and a part of the fugitive acids acetic acid and formic acid can be removed from the mixture the highly concentrated reaction mixture was neutralized with potassium hydroxide solution to ph 7 crystal growth of the potassium salt of op168 took place within a few days for further purification a re crystallization from water was performed for this purpose the crystalline raw product was dissolved again in a small amount of ultrapure water under heating within a few days the recrystallized compound was obtained from the saturated solution at room temperature in fine crystalline form the salt is stable at ambient conditions the confirmation of the anionic species op168 mz 167 9608 was done by ion exchange chromatography coupled to an accurate time of flight mass spectrometer after electrospray ionization ic esi tof the salt composition was confirmed by elemental analyses using inductively coupled plasma coupled to mass spectrometry icp ms sulfur calculated 13 1 found 14 0 potassium calculated 31 9 found 29 9 2 4 isolation of op170 by preparative ion chromatography starting point for the isolation of op170 is an ozonated acesulfame solution several crystallization experiments of op170 with this solution were not successful because op170 decomposes under the influence of heat aging and ph changes also the fast evaporation of water under mild conditions did not result in a salt containing residue of op170 a second approach was the synthesis of op170 by using following the pathway the reaction of glyoxylic acid and thionyl chloride 48 h reflux results in glyoxylic acid chloride potassium sulfamate and dimethyle formamide as a solvent were added to the reaction mixture at 40 c traces of op170 in the resulting reaction mixture were confirmed by ic esi tof analysis but the purification and isolation of op170 was not successful in any case because of the decomposition of the product because of the missing method to produce purified and stable op170 we decided another approach to investigate op170 for toxicological tests the isolation of op170 from ozonated acesulfame reaction mixtures using our established ion exchange chromatographic method was successful to expand the analytical method to an semi quantitative level a 4 mm column high concentration levels β0 ace 5 g l a large injection volume 100 μl and repeated injections 20 times was used a three way valve was implemented after the conductivity detection unit in order to separate the fraction with the target compound op170 in the chromatographic time frame from 8 5 min to 9 5 min into a vial which was cooled to 5 c because of the decomposition characteristics of op170 and to ensure a maximum concentration level of op170 in the test solution the process steps ozonation isolation transfer to the other lab and the experimental toxicological procedure were done within two days even under such conditions fractions of op170 decompose within two days to a residual content of approximately 30 2 5 equipment 2 5 1 ion exchange chromatography ic an ion chromatograph ics 5000 dionex sunnyvale ca usa coupled to a conductivity detector dionex waltham usa or a 1200 series uv

set to 30 c in addition to uv detection and conductivity detection ion chromatography was used with icp ms and esi tof detection 2 5 2 inductively coupled plasma coupled to mass spectrometry icp ms ion chromatography was coupled to icp ms to detect sulfur containing ops and to calculate a mass balance of sulfur in treated samples for this purpose the ic system described above equipped with an electrochemical suppressor was coupled to an icp ms 7500 ce system from agilent technologies waldbronn germany for the detection of sulfur oxide ion so m z 48 the detection of so was chosen to avoid high background signals deriving from oxygen dimers at m z 32 2 5 3 high resolution mass spectrometry q tof ms ic with electrochemical suppression was coupled to a 6540 uhd high resolution quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer q tof agilent technologies paolo alto usa for measurements of the exact masses of the ops q tof ms was used which is equipped with an esi used in negative and positive ionization mode 2 6 methods of concentration 2 6 1 solid phase extraction ozonated samples from the batch method with low levels of ace were concentrated by solid phase extraction spe a sample volume of 1 l was pre concentrated with 2 g solid phase extraction material spe stratax gigatube phenomenex aschaffenburg germany the material was washed with 20 ml methanol and 40 ml deionized water prior extraction after sample application the material was dried with nitrogen for 1 h and subsequently eluted with 4 10 ml methanol and 1 10 ml acetone the pooled organic extracts were evaporated to dryness 20 mbar 30 c 15 min and reconstituted by adding first 0 8 ml ethanol and then 19 2 ml deionized water the resulting extract of 20 ml 50 fold concentration has an ethanol content of 4 and shows no significant effect in the toxicological tests 2 6 2 vacuum concentration a vacuum concentrator speeddry 2 33ir christ osterode germany was used to concentrate non volantile ops in reaction mixtures with starting concentrations of ace e g β0 ace 5 mg l a sample volume of 1 l was evaporated to a final volume of 20 ml 50 fold enrichment wherefore the concentrator pressure was set to approx 15 mbar an elevated temperature 50 c of the sample holder and the tubes by ir radiation intake results in a sample temperature from 10 c to 15 c both temperatures can be monitored by separate sensors during the run by using the centrifuge option of the concentrator 1000 rpm no retardation of boiling occurs the overall time of the vacuum concentration procedure requires approx 1 d at high concentration levels the deposition of salts e g calcium carbonate from tap water occurs furthermore the levels of solved ions e g sodium calcium magnesium sulfate chloride nitrate increase significantly the osmolarity the osmolarity of the used tap water is increased from 0 006 osmol kg to 0 065 osmol kg but the concentrates showed no significant effect in the applied toxicological tests 2 7 genotoxicological test methods different genotoxicity tests were used for the project bacterial tests were used to determine the damage of the genetic material dna as a result of activation of the dna repair system of the cell umu test on the one hand and on the other hand to determine the mutagenic potential ames fluctuation test in addition two in vitro test systems with mammalian cells were used the micronucleus test allows the detection of genotoxic effects of mammalian cells while the comet assay serves as an indicator test for primary dna damage because of these different test methods the corresponding samples were therefore examined by bacterial test systems as well as cell culture tests the fact that these test systems are fast relatively simple and well standardized provides the possibility to significantly speed up the assessment process since a test alone is not sufficient to evaluate the toxicological relevance of a genotoxic effect or to exclude it in the case of a negative result bacterial and mammalian cell tests are necessary the tests used here are already known from internationally harmonized toxicological test strategies eastmond et al 2009 jovanović et al 2018 kirkland et al 2011 prantl et al 2018 2 7 1 umu test the umu test was carried out according to iso 13829 according to the protocol detailed in prantl et al 2016 the tester strain salmonella typhimurium ta1535 psk1002 was used with and without metabolic activation by rat liver extract s9 each test concentration was tested threefold in 96 well microtiterplates brand gmbh co kg wertheim germany the induction rate ir corresponds to the increase of the extinction at 420 nm relative to the negative control bacterial growth and density were determined turbidimetrically from the optical density at 600 nm for growth factors gf below 0 5 the results are not valid due to cytotoxicity an induction rate 1 5 is considered as a positive effect in accordance with din 38415 t3 4 nitroquinoline 1 oxide 0 05 μg l s9 and 2 aminoanthracene 0 2 μg l s9 were tested in parallel as positive controls 2 7 2 ames fluctuation test for determining bacterial mutagenicity the ames fluctuation test with two tester strains ta98 und ta100 of salmonella typhimurium with and without metabolic activation by liver extract s9 was applied the ames fluctuation test was carried out according to the standard iso 11350 according to the method detailed in reifferscheid et al 2012 for the enrichment phase the test bacteria are grown overnight afterwards the bacteria are exposed to various dilutions in 24 well microtiter plates for 100 min at 37 c in addition a positive control and a negative control are carried on each plate exposure exposure phase during the incubation the bacteria were incubated in 384 well microtiter plates in almost histidine free culture medium for two days at 37 c a ph indicator which is present in the culture medium causes a colour change from purple to yellow if bacteria grow these cavaties with bacteria growth can be detected by the change of the absorption at 420 nm a sample is classified as mutagenic according to the software evaluation from toxrat toxrat solutions gmbh naheweg 15 52477 alsdorf germany this analysis relates to a two stage statistical method that is recommended from the literature reifferscheidt et al 2012 positive effects were counted only as genotoxic if a cytotoxic effect could be ruled out at the same time since the iso 11350 does not define a limit for the cytotoxicity c the limit was pragmatic set to c 50 samples are evaluated only as genotoxic when tested as positive in three independent repetitions 2 7 3 micronucleus test the micronucleus test was performed with v79 cells a fibroblast cell line established from lung tissue of a male chinese hamster according to oecd 487 2014 with specifications described in iso 21427 2 and by reifferscheid et al 2008 the cell line was supplied by the federal institute for hydrology bfg koblenz germany the micronuclei induction allows the detection of chromosome damage caused by clastogenic chromosome breaking and aneugenic disrupting the spindle apparatus substances kirsch volders 1997 parry and sors 1993 during cell division chromosome fragments are no longer integrated into the nuclei of the daughter cells they remain in the cytoplasm generating micronuclei which can be detected by light optical microscopy an increased incidence of micronuclei means unrepaired damage of the dna and thus manifests genetic damage which suggests a risk for succeeding cell generations in a pre test the cytotoxicity of the samples was determined by counting the cell density after 24 h incubation the highest test concentration should not exceed 50 cytotoxicity oecd 487 2014 iso 21427 2 2006 the cells were seeded in a well defined density about 80 000 cells 5 ml and are allowed to adhere over a period of 6 h to the surface of a microscope slide the sample is tested at three dilutions and incubated for 4 h s9 or 24 h without s9 together with the cells the addition of s9 mix a rat liver fraction enables the simulation of metabolic activation of pro mutagenic substances as in mammalian liver cells gustavsson et al 2007 after washing and fixation giemsa staining of the cells was performed using light optical microscopy at least 2 1000 cells per test concentration next to positive and negative controls two independent replicates were analyzed for the occurrence of micronuclei dimethyl sulfoxide dmso 0 1 and ethanol 0 8 were used as solvent controls these concentrations are based on laboratory historical experience and literature data kais et al 2013 in accordance with iso 21427 2 2006 ethyl methansulfonate 350 μg ml s9 and cyclophosphamide 2 5 μg ml s9 were tested as positive controls the quality check of the proliferation rate 12 h 16 h for doubling of the cell population and plating efficiency 90 were regularly reviewed the results of the micronucleus test were considered being positive genotoxic effect when the micronuclei frequency was above 3 and significantly different to the controls iso 21427 2 2006 the chi square test with yates correction was used as appropriate statistical method richardson et al 1989 2 7 4 comet assay the alkaline comet assay or single cell gel electrophoresis assay was also performed with the v79 cell line the comet assay detects dna single strand breaks that caused relaxation of dna supercoils the combination of dna gel electrophoresis with fluorescence microscopy visualize the amount of dna strands migration from individual agarose embedded cells and the number of dna breaks in an individual cell therefore the tail moment a product of the fluorescence intensity in the tail and the tail length of selected comets were measured the assay was basically conducted according to the technique described by hartmann et al 2004 and singh et al 1988 and further modified in order to increase reproducibility and to improve handling the cells were seeded at a well defined density 1 106 to 2 106 cells ml and incubated for 2 h with and without metabolic activation s9 with the test item in at least 3 dilutions after the incubation period trypsinated cells were centrifuged 300 g 8 min 4 c and the cell pellets were resuspended in cold buffer pbs to avoid artificial dna damage the vials were kept on ice and viability of the isolated cells was assessed by the trypan blue exclusion method none of the samples had to be discarded as all together

statistical analysis data were analyzed with the kruskal wallis h test sigmastat 3 1 systat erkrath germany depending on raw data distribution and followed by post hoc procedures 3 results and discussion for the comprehensive chemical characterization and quantification of the different ozonation products of ace anion exchange chromatography with different detection systems were used the arrows in fig 1 indicate the types of used combinations beside the common used hyphenation of exchange chromatography with suppressed conductivity detection or uv absorption also advanced techniques including icp ms and esi tof were used the ic icp ms method is useful for the quantification of transformation products without pure substances available as reference materials e g op170 because the sensitivity of an element in the icp ms is foremost independent of the chemical species as a supplement a method using high resolution mass spectrometry ic esi tof supplies the molecular formula of the ops the use of both detectors in combination with the same separation technique is a powerful tool for the quantification of yet unknown transformation products 3 1 analytical characterization of ace samples treated with ozone the chemical structures of ace and its seven transformation products are shown in fig 2 all compounds are negatively charged therefore anion exchange chromatography was selected for separation ammonium bicarbonate serves as mobile phase the gradient elution profile was optimized for the separation of op170 and op168 and time accepting a moderate separation of the three compounds formic acid acetic acid and sulfamic acid because of high eluent concentrations of bicarbonate 30 mmol l to 100 mmol l the conductivity of the suppressed eluent is still high and the gradient profile is reflected in the conductivity detection and in absorption detection at 210 nm beside of op168 and op170 all compounds are commercially available as pure substances op168 was isolated and used as pure substance after crystallization of ozonated solutions of ace the sulfur containing components can be detected by ic icp ms and ic esi tof figs 3 6 show chromatogramms of dissolved ace in pure water after a treatment by ozone for 0 min 60 min 120 min and 180 min in the sample of 0 min only ace is present in the sample a quantitative transformation of ace is completed after approx 3 h the mass balance of sulfur containing species was determined by ic icp ms method the division of sulfur after ozone treatment originated from ace 100 was in one example 30 7 sulfamic acid 29 1 op170 17 6 op168 7 9 ace and 0 2 sulfuric acid therefore the total recovery of sulfur was 86 and only 14 of the sulfur mass balance is still missing the process of transformation of dissolved ace 5 g l by ozone was investigated for approx 3 h during the treatment a periodic sampling and quantification by ic cd and ic uv was done fig 7 shows the relative amounts of ace and its transformation products vs time after 2 h a complete transformation of ace was observed during this period the concentrations of acetate formiate sulfamate op170 and op168 are increasing and no sulfate or oxalate are detectable during ace is still present in the sample after the complete transformation of ace the concentration of op170 aldehyde decreases while op168 is still increasing we suppose a secondary transformation step of op170 to op168 by ozone 3 2 formation of two major ozonation products as described op168 and op170 results from ozonated ace solutions scheurer et al 2009 op168 can be isolated as pure substance by crystallization the other product op170 the compound with the aldehyde group showed a poor stability and was lost after synthesis experiments from basic chemicals purification various attempts to synthesize it from basic chemicals were difficult and the recovery of op170 remained very low a further method for the isolation of op170 was the isolation from a high concentrated solution of ozonated ace solutions with a semi preparative chromatography however since op170 was unstable and might be a reactive compound no solid substance was available for this reason genotoxicological studies were carried out directly with collected op170 fractions received by ion exchange chromatography the matrix in which ace is dissolved has a significant influence of the amount of op170 present in the treated sample the amount of op170 is increased if ultrapure water is used as solvent much lower amounts of op170 are detectable in comparable samples based on tap water in fig 8 chromatograms of a multi standard mixture an ace sample after ozone treatment and the fraction of op170 re injection is shown those fractions contain only the transformation product op170 and a small amount of carbon dioxide as a residue of eluent suppression 3 3 evaluation of ozone treatment for the aquatic environment ace can be partially degraded by ozone making investigation of the transformation products so important in order to protect the aquatic enviroment buerge et al 2009 bourgin et al 2018 while the degradation of ace by conventional wastewater treatment plants is rather low compared to other artificial sweeteners the degradation saccharin sac and cyclamate cyc by wastewater treatment is up to 90 buerge et al 2009 scheurer et al 2009 2011 even in drinking water concentrations of ace up to 7 2 μg l were detected prasse et al 2011 in order to protect the aquatic environment from micropollutants such as ace and to reduce the possibly harmful entry various cleaning technologies e g combinations of ozonation with sand and charcoal filters should be examined for their efficiency microbiological methods can also help to determine the effects of micropollutants and transformation products resulting from the waste water treatment such as ozone treatment and to be able to initiate appropriate measures triebskorn et al 2013 3 4 genotoxicological studies for a comprehensive toxicological investigation various ace solutions were investigated with four biological test systems umu ames micronucleus and comet assay for this purpose ace was dissolved in two different concentrations 200 mg l and 5 g l in ultrapure water sample a b and c and one in drinking water sample d the drinking water used was obtained from groundwater through natural treatment it is was not chlorinated and has a ph of 7 2 an electrical conductivity of 610 μs cm and a calcium carbonate hardness of 3 2 mmol l to investigate the transformation products the pure substance op168 sample e and a fraction by semi preparative chromatography containing op170 sample f were tested for the second approach ozonated ace samples after enrichment were analyzed two methods solid phase extraction and vacuum concentration sample g and h a list of the tested samples is shown in table 1 3 4 1 concentrated ozonated acesulfame solutions in the bacterial tests the ozonated sample dissolved in drinking water sample d showed no effect in the umu and ames test even after concentration steps by spe or vacuum enrichment by a factor of 50 no genotoxicity was detected sample g and h see table 1 in contrast higher concentrated ozonated samples in ultra pure water without enrichment samples a and c showed genotoxic effects in the umu test micronucleus test and comet assay a test repetition of the umu test with a second ozonated ace solution in ultra pure water sample b confirmed the results from the first test only the ames fluctuation test showed no effect even if the ace samples in ultrapure water were tested in summary the positive genotoxic effect of the ozonated ace solution in ultrapure water was confirmed in three different test systems of two laboratories whereas the testing of the concentrated ace and the ozonated ace solution by using drinking water as matrix showed no positive effects fig 9 also in the comet assay the genotoxic effect of the ozonated ace sample c was identifiable a significant positive result could be detected at the highest concentration step 32 mg l the same applies to the results of the micronucleus test a genotoxicity could also be detected for the ace sample in ultrapure water see fig 11 the ozonated ace sample in ultrapure water sample c was also tested for genotoxicity in the micronucleus test see fig 11 at a concentration of 8 mg l this test showed a genotoxic effect for the ozonated sample 3 4 2 single compound testing of op168 sample e one of the major ops op168 sample e of ace was successfully isolated by crystallization as a pure substance therefore this transformation product of ace was tested like standard chemicals with defined boundary conditions the highest tested concentration of op168 was 1000 mg l in none of the tests umu test ames fluctuation test micronucleus test or comet assay any positive effect was observed this result suggests that op168 is not the transformation product which is responsible to the positive test results when testing the ozonated samples of ace 3 4 3 testing op170 by using preparative chromatography sample f the second major ozonation product op170 of acesulfame sample f was directly tested in collected ic fractions without any purification or pre treatment although the samples were tested within 24 h after ozone treatment the fraction did not show any genotoxicity in the test systems of the umu and micronucleus test and comet assay the reason for those results might be also a too low concentration of op170 or the insufficient stability of the aldehyde metabolite false negative test result therefore a complete estimation of the toxic effects of op170 was not possible 3 4 4 toxicological assessment of the two major ops even though two approaches were not successful op170 was not available as a pure substance or by isolation or synthesis an alternative attempt for carrying out a toxicological evaluation was used studies on a preparative scale if only one substance with its ops is assessed special precautions and extra care should be taken when the conditions and also the formation of ops correspond no longer to real conditions of drinking water treatment an advantage in the assessment of a real water sample is that unknown substances which are also present in the water samples are evaluated at the same time if as in this case studies are carried out on a preparative scale this advantage is omitted and only the known ops can be evaluated but other benefits outweigh in this situation op170 could not be concentrated up to the required threshold concentration but a toxicological assessment of this sample without knowing the realistic metabolites could lead to false assumptions far from reality the evaluation of the sample in the present study would therefore probably not be relevant for the actual situation in drinking water in practice op170 does not play a significant role since its formation is significantly reduced in drinking water matrix and its fast decomposition due to its instability 3 4 5 testing spe and vacuum concentrate sample g and h the samples concentrated via spe respectively vacuum concentration were also tested only the comet assay showed significantly positive results for these samples while the other three tests showed no effects for the genotoxicity testing probably the low stability of the ozonation products is one of the influencing factors for these test results 3 4 6 cause for genotoxic effect op170 could be assumed as responsible for the effects observed in the genotoxicological bioassays due to an almost even mass balance 86 based on the analytical quantification of sulfur via ic icp ms it is considered that no major op is overlooked since the other ops are not genotoxic op168 sulfamide sulfate acetate and following the exclusion principle probably the aldehyde hydrate op170 is responsible for the genotoxic effect 3 4 7 need of a risk assessment and correspondence to real treatment condition the risk assessment of ops is essential for providing toxicologically safe drinking water ozonation decreases or eliminates many contaminants ozone acts as a disinfectant and oxidant and is very useful for the drinking water treatment but ozonation can lead to undesired by products such as ndma schmidt and brauch 2008 these metabolites mostly occur in low concentration and the toxic effect is unknown in order to accomplish a reliable toxicological assessment the results of laboratory tests must reflect the real circumstances here the impact of the water matrix was clearly demonstrated and the results differed if ultrapure water or drinking water was used in the overall view for one of the major ops a genotoxic effect was detected in three different test systems we suggest that op170 might be the critical substance but the relevance of these findings for the drinking water has to be checked the transformation product op170 has a very low turnover rate in drinking water and the analysis indicate an increased formation in ultrapure water it was shown that op170 is produced in ultrapure water in high amounts in comparison to drinking water and its stability is poorly thus the relevance for the drinking water is rather low due to a very low turnover rate and the probable good removal by activated carbon filters a hazard caused by op170 is not given for real drinking water 3 5 fate of micropollutant abatement the biological tests show that water treatment can lead to certain previously unknown risks although the ace can be decomposed by the ozone potentially toxic transformation products can arise ace is a common and persistent anthropogenic water contaminant in germany an ace per capita load of 5 8 12 7 mg person and day was determined this pollutant is not removed in conventional wastewater treatement plants and is found in the influents and effluents of wastewater treatment plants scheurer et al 2009 longrée et al 2011 therefore possibilities for a significant reduction of ace and its related transformation products should be sought in order to protect the ecosystem and drinking water resources bourgin et al 2018 various approaches were discussed in order to counteract this problem of water contaminants a frequently mentioned option is the coupling of ozone treatment with sand filtration to reduce contaminates and to intercept the activated transformation products bourgin et al 2018 ashauer 2016 triebskorn et al 2013 the success of these efforts to improve water quality can be determined for example by the spear value actually the spears value was developed for the detection of pesticide stress but it was shown that the spears indicator is also sensitive to the influence micropollutants of waste water treatment plants is ashauer 2016 showed that the use of ozone combined with sand filtration could have a favorable influence on the composition of microinvertebrates in the stream due to the use of ozone the pollutant input of the waste water treatment plants was reduced and the water quality of the stream improved on the basis of impacts on the composition of the macroinvertebrate community the water quality after ozonation and other post treatment need to be assessed as demonstrated here in this study this can be done via the ecological status of the water for example spears value or genotoxic bioassays as displayed here in this study 4 conclusion the results of our study demonstrate that a toxicological evaluation of individual ops is a challenge if not all ops are available as pure substances or the ops are unstable and hard to isolate there is no standard procedure on how a risk assessment can be performed basic problems like matrix effects and instability occur different approaches such as isolation pre concentration or synthesis were not successful for direct testing of op170 genotoxicity is a parameter of the substance which is usually detected only at higher concentrations than those in a real water sample the only possibility for testing op170 was the ozonation of a very high concentrated ace solution at laboratory scale it was analytically shown that the formation rate of op 170 in drinking water matrix is clearly lower and that an analog study of an ozonated ace solution in drinking water resulted in negative effects in the bioassays the influence of the water matrix and the stability of the ops must be known for further extensive studies the formation of the ops in the trace concentration range and on a preparative scale should be in the same ratio this ratio of ops should be taken into account for the assessment the formation of op can differ and thus do not reflect the actual environmental situation this could lead to a false final outcome the relevance for real drinking water must be given and only toxic ops which are relevant for the real environment conditions should lead to preventive actions and risk management to protect the quality of the drinking water when detecting negative influences of trace substances the use of ozone and sand filters can lead to an improvement of the water quality the major ops in this study represent no risk to the drinking water as a result of the lack of stability and the low formation in drinking water matrix based on previous and the present studies the metabolites of ace are not expected to cause risks for drinking water suppliers but the importance of ace due to its persistence and abundance in drinking water and groundwater aquifers makes it necessary to assess the water quality after ozonation and other post treatments overall the main concern is the elimination of potential negative effects of water contaminants and the corresponding products which can result during post treatment such as ozonation this assessment is possible by an analysis of the various ecotoxicological endpoints or by performing biological cell respectively bacteria assays authors contribution ozonation ecperiments and chemical analysis were performed at tzw karlsruhe bacterial genotoxicitcy tests ames fluctuation

19026,the monitoring and control of drinking water quality is generally important as it significantly contributes to the health of the population in this context particular attention has to be paid to the use of treatment techniques during drinking water treatment it is known that the formation of reaction products transformation products has to be taken into account when oxidizing agents such as ozone are used different transformation products are classified as critical to health and require analytical examination the risk assessment for previously unknown transformation products can be difficult as far as not all transformation products are present as single substances or the individual substances are not present in a sufficient high concentration or cannot be isolated from the original solution the aim of this work is to show exemplarily the identification and quantification of ozonation products ops after ozonation and their toxicological characterization using the artificial sweetener acesulfame it was shown that ops can be fully characterized using ion chromatography in combination with different detection systems a major op could be recovered as a pure substance by crystallization and direct genotoxicological testing was possible without previous enrichment processes acesulfame samples of different concentrations in ultrapure and in drinking water after ozonation were tested in several genotoxicity tests these tests revealed genotoxic effects of acesulfame after ozonation in ultrapure water in several genotoxicological test systems micronucleus test umu test ames fluctuation test and comet assay in contrast the crystallized ozonation product op168 did not show any positive effects therefore it seems likely that the observed effect was caused by the second major product op170 however a sufficiently large amount of analytically pure substance op170 could not be obtained it was also shown that the rate of the op170 formation in drinking water is significantly lower than in ultrapure water and that ozonation in drinking water did not induce genotoxic effects graphical abstract image 1 keywords transformation products ozonation acesulfame risk assessment drinking water germany genotoxicity 1 introduction a widely used method for removing organic trace substances in drinking water treatment is the treatment with ozone in germany at least an amount of 10 of the supplied drinking water is ozonated happel et al 2013 ozone treatment is regarded inter alia as an effective and economically cost effective option for removing undesirable taste and odor as well as organic micropollutants joss et al 2008 in most cases treatment with ozone does not mineralize contaminants but results in the formation of unknown transformation products ops for which a toxicological assessment can be difficult simmons et al 2008 a prediction of the possible occurrence of undesired oxidation products and potentially critical by products is difficult the formation of toxicological critical ops from natural matter or anthropogenic trace substances during water treatment by ozone has been already shown for a biodegradation product of the fungicide tolylfluanide schmidt and brauch 2008 demonstrated that the metabolite n n dimethylsulfamide dms results during ozonation in the formation of n n dimethylnitrosamine ndma involving bromide as an catalytic reactant von gunten et al 2010 recently it was shown that bioassays are suitable tools for the effect based identification of adverse effects of chemicals in water bodies and waste water treatment effluents e g ashauer 2016 di paolo et al 2016 kunz et al 2017 neale et al 2017 valitalo et al 2016 as well as transformation products müller et al 2016 zhu et al 2016 therefore it was recently suggested to include effect based tools within the review process of the european water framework directive brack et al 2017 wernersson et al 2015 water framework directive brack et al 2017 wernersson et al 2015 investigations for a risk assessment on ops after ozonation of drinking water are useful and necessary it helps to prevent the raw water entry of substances which form critical ozonation products during the ozonation the findings obtained with the example ndma in previous studies demonstrated that reactive metabolites may be formed but the toxicological assessment of these metabolites is a complex challenge for the risk assessment practical proximity to the processing processes occurring in the water works is absolutely necessary in order to be able to actually evaluate the corresponding potential risk the test conditions should be as close as possible to reality but sometimes like in the case of ozonated acesulfame ace not all of the diverse ops are stable and separately isolatable for well standardized genotoxicity test systems higher concentrations as they usually occur in aquatic environment are required in order to reach the effective threshold of the test systems grummt et al 2013 the ops of ace generated under realistic conditions during ozonation of drinking water are known and characterized scheurer et al 2012 because of that the ozone experiments for op170 could have been carried out on a preparative scale and no realistic conditions were needed because the real ops are already identified higher amounts of the test substance and ozone concentrations could be used experimentally in order to concentrate specifically certain ops a higher concentration of ozone might cause varying compositions of the ops in addition to ozone and the test substance further organic and inorganic components are present in the water which can influence the ozone reaction ph value temperature amount of carbonate and natural organic matter also influence the reaction these influencing variables which are essentially controlled by the matrix vary from water to water the influence of the matrix was demonstrated depending on which water was used for the experiment studies showed an increased formation of the aldehyde op170 in ultra pure water compared to drinking water the ozone dose the ozone intake and decomposition curve and the reaction time determine the ozone exposure and the molar ratio between the trace substance and the oxidizing agents in practice a trace substance is present only in the ng l to lower μg l range and ozone is added in surplus in the present study this can be disregarded because the ops that occur during ozonation in conventional concentration had already been identified in a previous study and have been confirmed also under realistic condition scheurer et al 2009 this study focuses on a methodological approach to assess the genotoxicological potential of ops in ozonated ultra pure water and drinking water samples in this context it is necessary to consider various aspects of the toxicological assessment for example the threshold of the test system and the stability of the products in the sample toxicity testing of ops formed during oxidative water treatment is difficult in drinking water samples any eventual transformation product usually present in the concentration range between 0 1 μg l and 10 μg l must be enriched by several orders of magnitude because the sensitivity threshold of established genotoxicological test methods usually is several orders above the potential relevant concentration of microcontaminants e g 1 μg l in drinking water samples a concentration step is usually necessary because of the low concentration levels of contaminants in real water samples e g ozonated tap water a direct testing of the drinking water sample might lead to false negative results by not considering the sensitivity of the genotoxicological test systems for standardized genotoxilogical short term tests like the ames test the micronucleus test the comet assay and the umu test a concentration step is necessary and the following aspects have to be considered enrichment of samples by solid phase extraction spe or enrichment by evaporation is not always the most promising way to detect a possible genotoxicity due to the stability of the ops the presence of the ops may not be guaranteed after enrichment the need of an adequate coupling of the enrichment methods with the bioassays is essential in order not to stress the physiological limits of the test organisms and to avoid false positive results e g the tolerance of the test systems to organic solvents another approach is the testing of a highly concentrated treated solution on a laboratory scale ozonation under such high level conditions is not a realistic scenario and artifacts can be a result of the high concentration levels the conditions of the experiment do not correspond to those in the natural environment and the degradation pathway with the corresponding ozonation products can therefore deviate compared to the natural environment the reaction of the substances among each other cannot be excluded and the possible path of altered test substance products has to be clarified on the other hand one advantage of this high level approach is the possibility of producing a true blank sample of the treated water matrix without the test substance but because of these high concentrations the amounts of ozonation products in environmental samples should be known to allow an accurate toxicological assessment transferable onto reality if all ops are available as pure substances or if the individual substances could be enriched to a sufficient concentration level or could be isolated from the original sample the compounds can be tested as a simple individual chemical testing for this approach all ops should be known however in this case no mixed toxicity and their effects of a real sample can be studied the different approaches for a toxicological evaluation of the resulting ops after oxidative treatment raise many questions and gain in importance because of their presence in the environment these three different options for toxicity testing of ops formed during ozonation have been compared in the present study on the example of the artificial sweetener ace ace is a known contaminant of surface waters and of raw water used for drinking water production scheurer et al 2009 scheurer et al 2010 2011 the degradation of ace can vary in the course of time depending on the environmental conditions castronovo et al 2017 the main ozonation products ops of the ace have already been investigated by scheurer et al 2012 acetic acid and op 170 an anionic carboxylic acid and op 168 an aldehyde hydrate were identified as the main ozonation products of ace both ops were structural characterized but not toxicological reviewed 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals chemicals and standards were purchased from the following suppliers acesulfame potassium ammonium bicarbonate sodium acetate sulfamic acid sodium sufate oxalic acid potassium hydroxide glyoxylic acid thionyl chloride potassium formiate dimethyl formamide from sigma aldrich munich germany chemicals for the positive control of the genotoxicological tests 4 nitroquinoline 1 oxide 2 nitrofurantoin and 2 aminoanthracenes were also ordered from sigma aldrich munich germany 2 2 ozonation the ozone stock solution was generated in a bubble column reactor containing 5 l demineralized water an ozone generator ozomat com ad 02 anseros tübingen germany was used to produce ozone from oxygen by dielectric barrier discharge the gas flow was passed through the reactor which was maintained at 5 c the ozone waste of the gas flow was destroyed by a washing bottle containing thiosulfate solution after approximately 1 h an ozone saturation of 20 mg l to 30 mg l was reached in the stock solution as photometrically determined via the extinction of the dye indigotrisulfonate din 38408 3 this stock solution was used for the ozonation of low levels 0 5 mg l and 5 mg l of ace by the batch method the direct intake of ozone gas into a washing bottle v 2000 ml was used for the treatment of samples with high ace concentrations β ace 200 mg l to 5000 mg l a glass tap at the bottom of the bottle enabled the sampling during the ozonation process the ozone concentration in the gas phase before and after the reaction vessel was monitored by absorption of ozone at 254 nm the consumed ozone during the reaction can be calculated by the measured concentrations of both instruments the quantitative reaction of the c c double bond of the ace molecule results in a step of the consumption curve approx after 1 h with a starting amount of ace 2 g l 2 3 preparation of k2 op168 c2h2k2no6s ace 5 g 25 mmol was dissolved in 1000 ml distilled water and treated with ozone gas for 3 h in the wash bottle setup during ozonation the ph of the initially neutral solution decreased significantly to approx ph 3 the resulting reaction solution was concentrated at a rotary evaporator hereby water and a part of the fugitive acids acetic acid and formic acid can be removed from the mixture the highly concentrated reaction mixture was neutralized with potassium hydroxide solution to ph 7 crystal growth of the potassium salt of op168 took place within a few days for further purification a re crystallization from water was performed for this purpose the crystalline raw product was dissolved again in a small amount of ultrapure water under heating within a few days the recrystallized compound was obtained from the saturated solution at room temperature in fine crystalline form the salt is stable at ambient conditions the confirmation of the anionic species op168 mz 167 9608 was done by ion exchange chromatography coupled to an accurate time of flight mass spectrometer after electrospray ionization ic esi tof the salt composition was confirmed by elemental analyses using inductively coupled plasma coupled to mass spectrometry icp ms sulfur calculated 13 1 found 14 0 potassium calculated 31 9 found 29 9 2 4 isolation of op170 by preparative ion chromatography starting point for the isolation of op170 is an ozonated acesulfame solution several crystallization experiments of op170 with this solution were not successful because op170 decomposes under the influence of heat aging and ph changes also the fast evaporation of water under mild conditions did not result in a salt containing residue of op170 a second approach was the synthesis of op170 by using following the pathway the reaction of glyoxylic acid and thionyl chloride 48 h reflux results in glyoxylic acid chloride potassium sulfamate and dimethyle formamide as a solvent were added to the reaction mixture at 40 c traces of op170 in the resulting reaction mixture were confirmed by ic esi tof analysis but the purification and isolation of op170 was not successful in any case because of the decomposition of the product because of the missing method to produce purified and stable op170 we decided another approach to investigate op170 for toxicological tests the isolation of op170 from ozonated acesulfame reaction mixtures using our established ion exchange chromatographic method was successful to expand the analytical method to an semi quantitative level a 4 mm column high concentration levels β0 ace 5 g l a large injection volume 100 μl and repeated injections 20 times was used a three way valve was implemented after the conductivity detection unit in order to separate the fraction with the target compound op170 in the chromatographic time frame from 8 5 min to 9 5 min into a vial which was cooled to 5 c because of the decomposition characteristics of op170 and to ensure a maximum concentration level of op170 in the test solution the process steps ozonation isolation transfer to the other lab and the experimental toxicological procedure were done within two days even under such conditions fractions of op170 decompose within two days to a residual content of approximately 30 2 5 equipment 2 5 1 ion exchange chromatography ic an ion chromatograph ics 5000 dionex sunnyvale ca usa coupled to a conductivity detector dionex waltham usa or a 1200 series uv detector g1365b agilent technologies waldbronn germany was used to analyze ace and its ops separation of the analytes was achieved by using an ag 17 guard column 50 mm 2 mm and an as 17 analytical column 250 mm 2 mm both dionex for electrochemical suppression an asrs 300 2 mm dionex waltham usa was used a gradient elution method based on ammonium bicarbonate was used to ensure a separation with an almost neutral ph value 0 min 8 min 30 mmol l 8 min 12 min increase to 100 mmol l 100 mmol l until 30 min the flow rate was 0 25 ml min and the injection volume was 20 μl the column temperature was set to 30 c in addition to uv detection and conductivity detection ion chromatography was used with icp ms and esi tof detection 2 5 2 inductively coupled plasma coupled to mass spectrometry icp ms ion chromatography was coupled to icp ms to detect sulfur containing ops and to calculate a mass balance of sulfur in treated samples for this purpose the ic system described above equipped with an electrochemical suppressor was coupled to an icp ms 7500 ce system from agilent technologies waldbronn germany for the detection of sulfur oxide ion so m z 48 the detection of so was chosen to avoid high background signals deriving from oxygen dimers at m z 32 2 5 3 high resolution mass spectrometry q tof ms ic with electrochemical suppression was coupled to a 6540 uhd high resolution quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometer q tof agilent technologies paolo alto usa for measurements of the exact masses of the ops q tof ms was used which is equipped with an esi used in negative and positive ionization mode 2 6 methods of concentration 2 6 1 solid phase extraction ozonated samples from the batch method with low levels of ace were concentrated by solid phase extraction spe a sample volume of 1 l was pre concentrated with 2 g solid phase extraction material spe stratax gigatube phenomenex aschaffenburg germany the material was washed with 20 ml methanol and 40 ml deionized water prior extraction after sample application the material was dried with nitrogen for 1 h and subsequently eluted with 4 10 ml methanol and 1 10 ml acetone the pooled organic extracts were evaporated to dryness 20 mbar 30 c 15 min and reconstituted by adding first 0 8 ml ethanol and then 19 2 ml deionized water the resulting extract of 20 ml 50 fold concentration has an ethanol content of 4 and shows no significant effect in the toxicological tests 2 6 2 vacuum concentration a vacuum concentrator speeddry 2 33ir christ osterode germany was used to concentrate non volantile ops in reaction mixtures with starting concentrations of ace e g β0 ace 5 mg l a sample volume of 1 l was evaporated to a final volume of 20 ml 50 fold enrichment wherefore the concentrator pressure was set to approx 15 mbar an elevated temperature 50 c of the sample holder and the tubes by ir radiation intake results in a sample temperature from 10 c to 15 c both temperatures can be monitored by separate sensors during the run by using the centrifuge option of the concentrator 1000 rpm no retardation of boiling occurs the overall time of the vacuum concentration procedure requires approx 1 d at high concentration levels the deposition of salts e g calcium carbonate from tap water occurs furthermore the levels of solved ions e g sodium calcium magnesium sulfate chloride nitrate increase significantly the osmolarity the osmolarity of the used tap water is increased from 0 006 osmol kg to 0 065 osmol kg but the concentrates showed no significant effect in the applied toxicological tests 2 7 genotoxicological test methods different genotoxicity tests were used for the project bacterial tests were used to determine the damage of the genetic material dna as a result of activation of the dna repair system of the cell umu test on the one hand and on the other hand to determine the mutagenic potential ames fluctuation test in addition two in vitro test systems with mammalian cells were used the micronucleus test allows the detection of genotoxic effects of mammalian cells while the comet assay serves as an indicator test for primary dna damage because of these different test methods the corresponding samples were therefore examined by bacterial test systems as well as cell culture tests the fact that these test systems are fast relatively simple and well standardized provides the possibility to significantly speed up the assessment process since a test alone is not sufficient to evaluate the toxicological relevance of a genotoxic effect or to exclude it in the case of a negative result bacterial and mammalian cell tests are necessary the tests used here are already known from internationally harmonized toxicological test strategies eastmond et al 2009 jovanović et al 2018 kirkland et al 2011 prantl et al 2018 2 7 1 umu test the umu test was carried out according to iso 13829 according to the protocol detailed in prantl et al 2016 the tester strain salmonella typhimurium ta1535 psk1002 was used with and without metabolic activation by rat liver extract s9 each test concentration was tested threefold in 96 well microtiterplates brand gmbh co kg wertheim germany the induction rate ir corresponds to the increase of the extinction at 420 nm relative to the negative control bacterial growth and density were determined turbidimetrically from the optical density at 600 nm for growth factors gf below 0 5 the results are not valid due to cytotoxicity an induction rate 1 5 is considered as a positive effect in accordance with din 38415 t3 4 nitroquinoline 1 oxide 0 05 μg l s9 and 2 aminoanthracene 0 2 μg l s9 were tested in parallel as positive controls 2 7 2 ames fluctuation test for determining bacterial mutagenicity the ames fluctuation test with two tester strains ta98 und ta100 of salmonella typhimurium with and without metabolic activation by liver extract s9 was applied the ames fluctuation test was carried out according to the standard iso 11350 according to the method detailed in reifferscheid et al 2012 for the enrichment phase the test bacteria are grown overnight afterwards the bacteria are exposed to various dilutions in 24 well microtiter plates for 100 min at 37 c in addition a positive control and a negative control are carried on each plate exposure exposure phase during the incubation the bacteria were incubated in 384 well microtiter plates in almost histidine free culture medium for two days at 37 c a ph indicator which is present in the culture medium causes a colour change from purple to yellow if bacteria grow these cavaties with bacteria growth can be detected by the change of the absorption at 420 nm a sample is classified as mutagenic according to the software evaluation from toxrat toxrat solutions gmbh naheweg 15 52477 alsdorf germany this analysis relates to a two stage statistical method that is recommended from the literature reifferscheidt et al 2012 positive effects were counted only as genotoxic if a cytotoxic effect could be ruled out at the same time since the iso 11350 does not define a limit for the cytotoxicity c the limit was pragmatic set to c 50 samples are evaluated only as genotoxic when tested as positive in three independent repetitions 2 7 3 micronucleus test the micronucleus test was performed with v79 cells a fibroblast cell line established from lung tissue of a male chinese hamster according to oecd 487 2014 with specifications described in iso 21427 2 and by reifferscheid et al 2008 the cell line was supplied by the federal institute for hydrology bfg koblenz germany the micronuclei induction allows the detection of chromosome damage caused by clastogenic chromosome breaking and aneugenic disrupting the spindle apparatus substances kirsch volders 1997 parry and sors 1993 during cell division chromosome fragments are no longer integrated into the nuclei of the daughter cells they remain in the cytoplasm generating micronuclei which can be detected by light optical microscopy an increased incidence of micronuclei means unrepaired damage of the dna and thus manifests genetic damage which suggests a risk for succeeding cell generations in a pre test the cytotoxicity of the samples was determined by counting the cell density after 24 h incubation the highest test concentration should not exceed 50 cytotoxicity oecd 487 2014 iso 21427 2 2006 the cells were seeded in a well defined density about 80 000 cells 5 ml and are allowed to adhere over a period of 6 h to the surface of a microscope slide the sample is tested at three dilutions and incubated for 4 h s9 or 24 h without s9 together with the cells the addition of s9 mix a rat liver fraction enables the simulation of metabolic activation of pro mutagenic substances as in mammalian liver cells gustavsson et al 2007 after washing and fixation giemsa staining of the cells was performed using light optical microscopy at least 2 1000 cells per test concentration next to positive and negative controls two independent replicates were analyzed for the occurrence of micronuclei dimethyl sulfoxide dmso 0 1 and ethanol 0 8 were used as solvent controls these concentrations are based on laboratory historical experience and literature data kais et al 2013 in accordance with iso 21427 2 2006 ethyl methansulfonate 350 μg ml s9 and cyclophosphamide 2 5 μg ml s9 were tested as positive controls the quality check of the proliferation rate 12 h 16 h for doubling of the cell population and plating efficiency 90 were regularly reviewed the results of the micronucleus test were considered being positive genotoxic effect when the micronuclei frequency was above 3 and significantly different to the controls iso 21427 2 2006 the chi square test with yates correction was used as appropriate statistical method richardson et al 1989 2 7 4 comet assay the alkaline comet assay or single cell gel electrophoresis assay was also performed with the v79 cell line the comet assay detects dna single strand breaks that caused relaxation of dna supercoils the combination of dna gel electrophoresis with fluorescence microscopy visualize the amount of dna strands migration from individual agarose embedded cells and the number of dna breaks in an individual cell therefore the tail moment a product of the fluorescence intensity in the tail and the tail length of selected comets were measured the assay was basically conducted according to the technique described by hartmann et al 2004 and singh et al 1988 and further modified in order to increase reproducibility and to improve handling the cells were seeded at a well defined density 1 106 to 2 106 cells ml and incubated for 2 h with and without metabolic activation s9 with the test item in at least 3 dilutions after the incubation period trypsinated cells were centrifuged 300 g 8 min 4 c and the cell pellets were resuspended in cold buffer pbs to avoid artificial dna damage the vials were kept on ice and viability of the isolated cells was assessed by the trypan blue exclusion method none of the samples had to be discarded as all together presented viabilities higher than 90 the day before the experiments took place clean non frosted microscope glass slides were pre coated with 1 w v normal melting agarose nma and dried under ambient conditions embedding of cells was preceded by coating of the above prepared slides with a 0 7 w v agarose layer nma and then cover slipped after setting on a cooled glass plate coverslips were removed and 90 μl of 0 7 w v low melting agarose lma kept at 38 c in water bath was added to 30 μl of cell suspension approx 105 cells in duplicates resulting in a final lma concentration of 0 5 w v after brief and gently mixing cells were spread on the pre coated slide and cover slipped immediately from this moment on any exposure to natural or artificial light was avoided lma curing was achieved for 30 min at 4 c coverslips were then removed and the slides with embedded cells were incubated in for 1 5 h at 4 c in lysing solution ph 13 0 containing 100 mmol l edta 2 5 mol l nacl 1 v v triton x 100 and 10 v v dmso for dna unwinding slides were immersed for 20 min in a horizontal electrophoresis tank vwr darmstadt germany containing a cooled alkaline buffer 12 g l naoh und 0 37 g l edta electrophoresis 20 min 25 v 300 ma was followed by neutralizing slides in 400 mmol ltris hcl buffer ph 7 4 for 5 min slides were either directly scored or stored at 4 c in a humid glass chamber for a maximum of 5 d dna was visualized by staining with ethidium bromide stained slides were examined at a 400 fold magnification using a fluorescence olympus bhs microscope hamburg germany provided with a fluorescence attachment bh2 afl slides were randomly scored and 100 comets on duplicate slides were measured using the public domain image processing and analysis program scion image scion corp maryland usa data were captured and transferred to a computer by a frame grabber card lg 3 scion corp the tail moments were calculated by means of a ms excel macro developed by helma and uhl 2000 for statistical analysis data were analyzed with the kruskal wallis h test sigmastat 3 1 systat erkrath germany depending on raw data distribution and followed by post hoc procedures 3 results and discussion for the comprehensive chemical characterization and quantification of the different ozonation products of ace anion exchange chromatography with different detection systems were used the arrows in fig 1 indicate the types of used combinations beside the common used hyphenation of exchange chromatography with suppressed conductivity detection or uv absorption also advanced techniques including icp ms and esi tof were used the ic icp ms method is useful for the quantification of transformation products without pure substances available as reference materials e g op170 because the sensitivity of an element in the icp ms is foremost independent of the chemical species as a supplement a method using high resolution mass spectrometry ic esi tof supplies the molecular formula of the ops the use of both detectors in combination with the same separation technique is a powerful tool for the quantification of yet unknown transformation products 3 1 analytical characterization of ace samples treated with ozone the chemical structures of ace and its seven transformation products are shown in fig 2 all compounds are negatively charged therefore anion exchange chromatography was selected for separation ammonium bicarbonate serves as mobile phase the gradient elution profile was optimized for the separation of op170 and op168 and time accepting a moderate separation of the three compounds formic acid acetic acid and sulfamic acid because of high eluent concentrations of bicarbonate 30 mmol l to 100 mmol l the conductivity of the suppressed eluent is still high and the gradient profile is reflected in the conductivity detection and in absorption detection at 210 nm beside of op168 and op170 all compounds are commercially available as pure substances op168 was isolated and used as pure substance after crystallization of ozonated solutions of ace the sulfur containing components can be detected by ic icp ms and ic esi tof figs 3 6 show chromatogramms of dissolved ace in pure water after a treatment by ozone for 0 min 60 min 120 min and 180 min in the sample of 0 min only ace is present in the sample a quantitative transformation of ace is completed after approx 3 h the mass balance of sulfur containing species was determined by ic icp ms method the division of sulfur after ozone treatment originated from ace 100 was in one example 30 7 sulfamic acid 29 1 op170 17 6 op168 7 9 ace and 0 2 sulfuric acid therefore the total recovery of sulfur was 86 and only 14 of the sulfur mass balance is still missing the process of transformation of dissolved ace 5 g l by ozone was investigated for approx 3 h during the treatment a periodic sampling and quantification by ic cd and ic uv was done fig 7 shows the relative amounts of ace and its transformation products vs time after 2 h a complete transformation of ace was observed during this period the concentrations of acetate formiate sulfamate op170 and op168 are increasing and no sulfate or oxalate are detectable during ace is still present in the sample after the complete transformation of ace the concentration of op170 aldehyde decreases while op168 is still increasing we suppose a secondary transformation step of op170 to op168 by ozone 3 2 formation of two major ozonation products as described op168 and op170 results from ozonated ace solutions scheurer et al 2009 op168 can be isolated as pure substance by crystallization the other product op170 the compound with the aldehyde group showed a poor stability and was lost after synthesis experiments from basic chemicals purification various attempts to synthesize it from basic chemicals were difficult and the recovery of op170 remained very low a further method for the isolation of op170 was the isolation from a high concentrated solution of ozonated ace solutions with a semi preparative chromatography however since op170 was unstable and might be a reactive compound no solid substance was available for this reason genotoxicological studies were carried out directly with collected op170 fractions received by ion exchange chromatography the matrix in which ace is dissolved has a significant influence of the amount of op170 present in the treated sample the amount of op170 is increased if ultrapure water is used as solvent much lower amounts of op170 are detectable in comparable samples based on tap water in fig 8 chromatograms of a multi standard mixture an ace sample after ozone treatment and the fraction of op170 re injection is shown those fractions contain only the transformation product op170 and a small amount of carbon dioxide as a residue of eluent suppression 3 3 evaluation of ozone treatment for the aquatic environment ace can be partially degraded by ozone making investigation of the transformation products so important in order to protect the aquatic enviroment buerge et al 2009 bourgin et al 2018 while the degradation of ace by conventional wastewater treatment plants is rather low compared to other artificial sweeteners the degradation saccharin sac and cyclamate cyc by wastewater treatment is up to 90 buerge et al 2009 scheurer et al 2009 2011 even in drinking water concentrations of ace up to 7 2 μg l were detected prasse et al 2011 in order to protect the aquatic environment from micropollutants such as ace and to reduce the possibly harmful entry various cleaning technologies e g combinations of ozonation with sand and charcoal filters should be examined for their efficiency microbiological methods can also help to determine the effects of micropollutants and transformation products resulting from the waste water treatment such as ozone treatment and to be able to initiate appropriate measures triebskorn et al 2013 3 4 genotoxicological studies for a comprehensive toxicological investigation various ace solutions were investigated with four biological test systems umu ames micronucleus and comet assay for this purpose ace was dissolved in two different concentrations 200 mg l and 5 g l in ultrapure water sample a b and c and one in drinking water sample d the drinking water used was obtained from groundwater through natural treatment it is was not chlorinated and has a ph of 7 2 an electrical conductivity of 610 μs cm and a calcium carbonate hardness of 3 2 mmol l to investigate the transformation products the pure substance op168 sample e and a fraction by semi preparative chromatography containing op170 sample f were tested for the second approach ozonated ace samples after enrichment were analyzed two methods solid phase extraction and vacuum concentration sample g and h a list of the tested samples is shown in table 1 3 4 1 concentrated ozonated acesulfame solutions in the bacterial tests the ozonated sample dissolved in drinking water sample d showed no effect in the umu and ames test even after concentration steps by spe or vacuum enrichment by a factor of 50 no genotoxicity was detected sample g and h see table 1 in contrast higher concentrated ozonated samples in ultra pure water without enrichment samples a and c showed genotoxic effects in the umu test micronucleus test and comet assay a test repetition of the umu test with a second ozonated ace solution in ultra pure water sample b confirmed the results from the first test only the ames fluctuation test showed no effect even if the ace samples in ultrapure water were tested in summary the positive genotoxic effect of the ozonated ace solution in ultrapure water was confirmed in three different test systems of two laboratories whereas the testing of the concentrated ace and the ozonated ace solution by using drinking water as matrix showed no positive effects fig 9 also in the comet assay the genotoxic effect of the ozonated ace sample c was identifiable a significant positive result could be detected at the highest concentration step 32 mg l the same applies to the results of the micronucleus test a genotoxicity could also be detected for the ace sample in ultrapure water see fig 11 the ozonated ace sample in ultrapure water sample c was also tested for genotoxicity in the micronucleus test see fig 11 at a concentration of 8 mg l this test showed a genotoxic effect for the ozonated sample 3 4 2 single compound testing of op168 sample e one of the major ops op168 sample e of ace was successfully isolated by crystallization as a pure substance therefore this transformation product of ace was tested like standard chemicals with defined boundary conditions the highest tested concentration of op168 was 1000 mg l in none of the tests umu test ames fluctuation test micronucleus test or comet assay any positive effect was observed this result suggests that op168 is not the transformation product which is responsible to the positive test results when testing the ozonated samples of ace 3 4 3 testing op170 by using preparative chromatography sample f the second major ozonation product op170 of acesulfame sample f was directly tested in collected ic fractions without any purification or pre treatment although the samples were tested within 24 h after ozone treatment the fraction did not show any genotoxicity in the test systems of the umu and micronucleus test and comet assay the reason for those results might be also a too low concentration of op170 or the insufficient stability of the aldehyde metabolite false negative test result therefore a complete estimation of the toxic effects of op170 was not possible 3 4 4 toxicological assessment of the two major ops even though two approaches were not successful op170 was not available as a pure substance or by isolation or synthesis an alternative attempt for carrying out a toxicological evaluation was used studies on a preparative scale if only one substance with its ops is assessed special precautions and extra care should be taken when the conditions and also the formation of ops correspond no longer to real conditions of drinking water treatment an advantage in the assessment of a real water sample is that unknown substances which are also present in the water samples are evaluated at the same time if as in this case studies are carried out on a preparative scale this advantage is omitted and only the known ops can be evaluated but other benefits outweigh in this situation op170 could not be concentrated up to the required threshold concentration but a toxicological assessment of this sample without knowing the realistic metabolites could lead to false assumptions far from reality the evaluation of the sample in the present study would therefore probably not be relevant for the actual situation in drinking water in practice op170 does not play a significant role since its formation is significantly reduced in drinking water matrix and its fast decomposition due to its instability 3 4 5 testing spe and vacuum concentrate sample g and h the samples concentrated via spe respectively vacuum concentration were also tested only the comet assay showed significantly positive results for these samples while the other three tests showed no effects for the genotoxicity testing probably the low stability of the ozonation products is one of the influencing factors for these test results 3 4 6 cause for genotoxic effect op170 could be assumed as responsible for the effects observed in the genotoxicological bioassays due to an almost even mass balance 86 based on the analytical quantification of sulfur via ic icp ms it is considered that no major op is overlooked since the other ops are not genotoxic op168 sulfamide sulfate acetate and following the exclusion principle probably the aldehyde hydrate op170 is responsible for the genotoxic effect 3 4 7 need of a risk assessment and correspondence to real treatment condition the risk assessment of ops is essential for providing toxicologically safe drinking water ozonation decreases or eliminates many contaminants ozone acts as a disinfectant and oxidant and is very useful for the drinking water treatment but ozonation can lead to undesired by products such as ndma schmidt and brauch 2008 these metabolites mostly occur in low concentration and the toxic effect is unknown in order to accomplish a reliable toxicological assessment the results of laboratory tests must reflect the real circumstances here the impact of the water matrix was clearly demonstrated and the results differed if ultrapure water or drinking water was used in the overall view for one of the major ops a genotoxic effect was detected in three different test systems we suggest that op170 might be the critical substance but the relevance of these findings for the drinking water has to be checked the transformation product op170 has a very low turnover rate in drinking water and the analysis indicate an increased formation in ultrapure water it was shown that op170 is produced in ultrapure water in high amounts in comparison to drinking water and its stability is poorly thus the relevance for the drinking water is rather low due to a very low turnover rate and the probable good removal by activated carbon filters a hazard caused by op170 is not given for real drinking water 3 5 fate of micropollutant abatement the biological tests show that water treatment can lead to certain previously unknown risks although the ace can be decomposed by the ozone potentially toxic transformation products can arise ace is a common and persistent anthropogenic water contaminant in germany an ace per capita load of 5 8 12 7 mg person and day was determined this pollutant is not removed in conventional wastewater treatement plants and is found in the influents and effluents of wastewater treatment plants scheurer et al 2009 longrée et al 2011 therefore possibilities for a significant reduction of ace and its related transformation products should be sought in order to protect the ecosystem and drinking water resources bourgin et al 2018 various approaches were discussed in order to counteract this problem of water contaminants a frequently mentioned option is the coupling of ozone treatment with sand filtration to reduce contaminates and to intercept the activated transformation products bourgin et al 2018 ashauer 2016 triebskorn et al 2013 the success of these efforts to improve water quality can be determined for example by the spear value actually the spears value was developed for the detection of pesticide stress but it was shown that the spears indicator is also sensitive to the influence micropollutants of waste water treatment plants is ashauer 2016 showed that the use of ozone combined with sand filtration could have a favorable influence on the composition of microinvertebrates in the stream due to the use of ozone the pollutant input of the waste water treatment plants was reduced and the water quality of the stream improved on the basis of impacts on the composition of the macroinvertebrate community the water quality after ozonation and other post treatment need to be assessed as demonstrated here in this study this can be done via the ecological status of the water for example spears value or genotoxic bioassays as displayed here in this study 4 conclusion the results of our study demonstrate that a toxicological evaluation of individual ops is a challenge if not all ops are available as pure substances or the ops are unstable and hard to isolate there is no standard procedure on how a risk assessment can be performed basic problems like matrix effects and instability occur different approaches such as isolation pre concentration or synthesis were not successful for direct testing of op170 genotoxicity is a parameter of the substance which is usually detected only at higher concentrations than those in a real water sample the only possibility for testing op170 was the ozonation of a very high concentrated ace solution at laboratory scale it was analytically shown that the formation rate of op 170 in drinking water matrix is clearly lower and that an analog study of an ozonated ace solution in drinking water resulted in negative effects in the bioassays the influence of the water matrix and the stability of the ops must be known for further extensive studies the formation of the ops in the trace concentration range and on a preparative scale should be in the same ratio this ratio of ops should be taken into account for the assessment the formation of op can differ and thus do not reflect the actual environmental situation this could lead to a false final outcome the relevance for real drinking water must be given and only toxic ops which are relevant for the real environment conditions should lead to preventive actions and risk management to protect the quality of the drinking water when detecting negative influences of trace substances the use of ozone and sand filters can lead to an improvement of the water quality the major ops in this study represent no risk to the drinking water as a result of the lack of stability and the low formation in drinking water matrix based on previous and the present studies the metabolites of ace are not expected to cause risks for drinking water suppliers but the importance of ace due to its persistence and abundance in drinking water and groundwater aquifers makes it necessary to assess the water quality after ozonation and other post treatments overall the main concern is the elimination of potential negative effects of water contaminants and the corresponding products which can result during post treatment such as ozonation this assessment is possible by an analysis of the various ecotoxicological endpoints or by performing biological cell respectively bacteria assays authors contribution ozonation ecperiments and chemical analysis were performed at tzw karlsruhe bacterial genotoxicitcy tests ames fluctuation

19027,pharmaceuticals in agricultural soils originating from irrigation with treated wastewater and land applied biosolids can enter field crops however little is known about the role of pore water in plant uptake of pharmaceuticals from soils in this study the fate uptake and distribution of fifteen commonly used pharmaceuticals in soil water radish systems were investigated to examine the relationship between the accumulation and their physicochemical processes in soils the results indicate that the distribution of pharmaceuticals between soil and pore water as well as their biodegradation combined to govern the bioavailability of pharmaceuticals to plant uptake fourteen out of 15 pharmaceuticals could enter radish tissues in which the accumulation ranged from 2 1 to 14080 ng g comparison of bioconcentration factors bcfs on the basis of pharmaceutical concentration in bulk soil vs in pore water implies that pharmaceuticals present in soil pore water are the major bioavailable fractions to plant uptake the pore water based bcfs exhibited a positive linear relationship with log d ow for the pharmaceuticals with 90 as neutral species in soil pore water while such relationship was not observed between bulk soil based bcfs and log d ow mainly due to sorption by soil other than hydrophobicity the dissociation of ionizable pharmaceuticals in the soil pore water and or root cells may lead to the ion trap effects and thus influence the uptake and translocation process the large molecular size pharmaceuticals e g tylosin manifested a minimum uptake due plausibly to the limited permeability of cell membranes graphical abstract image 1 keywords plant uptake soil pore water bioavailability bioaccumulation translocation 1 introduction some

effectively remove all pharmaceuticals from the influents leaving the pharmaceuticals in the effluents at the levels of ng l to low μg l gros et al 2010 sui et al 2011 vanderford and snyder 2006 and in biosolids at μg kg to low mg kg dry weight clarke and smith 2011 mcclellan and halden 2010 irrigation with the treated wastewater and land application of biosolids are common agricultural practices which lead to the dissemination of a wide range of pharmaceuticals in agricultural soils with concentration up to mg kg levels carter et al 2014 durán alvarez et al 2009 kinney et al 2006 vazquez roig et al 2010 for example land application of biosolids at a rate of 5 kg m2 caused triclosan concentration of 0 77 0 95 mg kg in the farm soils located in bedfordshire uk butler et al 2012 one major consequence of the soil contamination is that these pharmaceuticals could enter food chain after plant uptake and pose potential risks to human and animal health via dietary consumption christou et al 2017 de boer et al 2018 sallach et al 2015 wu et al 2014 paltiel et al 2016 recently found that carbamazepine and its metabolites were detected in human urine after consuming the fresh produce irrigated with treated wastewater in soil plant systems the amount of organic chemical uptake by plant roots depends largely on sorption desorption of contaminants in soils and their physicochemical properties it is assumed that organic chemicals present in soil pore water are readily bioavailable to plant uptake miller et al 2016 and soil water serves as the carrier to move the chemicals into plants the distribution of pharmaceuticals in soil water plant systems is commonly characterized by bioconcentration factor bcf which is typically calculated as the ratio of pharmaceutical concentration in plant to that in bulk soil hurtado et al 2016 karnjanapiboonwong et al 2011 pan et al 2014 shenker et al 2011 wu et al 2010 however pharmaceuticals present in soil pore water vs sorb by soil could manifest different bioavailability to plant uptake therefore bcfs calculated on the basis of pharmaceutical concentration in bulk soil are not comparable among the studies using different soils because of the varying affinities of pharmaceuticals to soils for instance soil based bcfs of seven benzodiazepines in radish could vary by up to 86 0 times between two soils carter et al 2018 the difference of soil based bcfs between three soils for caffeine carbamazepine and lamotrigine in tomato or cucumber can up to 20 7 8 and 245 times respectively goldstein et al 2014 in fact bcfs calculated by pharmaceutical concentration in soil pore water are believed to provide more accurate information to describe the uptake process since pharmaceuticals in soil pore water are directly available to plant roots for example blaine et al 2014 used pore water based bcfs of perfluoroalkyl acids in four vegetables grown in soils to explore the relationship between bioaccumulation and chemical properties and found the consistent results with the vegetables grown in hydroponic solution but not for soil based bcfs despite numerous greenhouse and field studies that have been conducted very limited studies were conducted to systematically evaluate the contribution of pharmaceuticals in soil pore water to the bioaccumulation in plants boxall et al 2006 carter et al 2014 water is believed to carry xenobiotic chemicals e g pharmaceuticals to cross plant root cortex by symplastic intracellular space and apoplastic extracellular space pathways mcfarlane and trapp 1994 trapp and pussemier 1991 in plant roots casparian strip composing primarily of hydrophobic suberin and lignin functions as a water impermeable barrier to prevent water and pharmaceuticals from passing through the endodermis via the apoplastic route naseer et al 2012 schreiber 2010 therefore pharmaceuticals have to reenter the symplastic pathway to cross cell membranes and enter the xylem for many nonionic organic compounds the accumulation in plants is positively related to their lipophilicity as indicated by the linear relationship between bcfs and octanol water partition coefficient k ow briggs et al 1982 1983 however plant uptake of ionic compounds is determined by the combination of hydrophobicity chemical speciation and surrounding solution ph briggs et al 1987 trapp 2000 most pharmaceuticals are ionizable compounds and have low hydrophobicity e g log d ow 2 therefore the relations developed for nonionic organic contaminants may not be applicable to the uptake of pharmaceuticals for example no apparent relationship was observed between log bcf and log d ow ph adjusted k ow to neutral species for 20 pharmaceuticals including acids bases and neutral compounds in hydroponically grown lettuce spinach cucumber and pepper wu et al 2013 however strong correlations were observed when the data were limited to neutral pharmaceuticals the relationship between plant uptake of ionic pharmaceuticals and their physicochemical properties still remain largely unknown in the complex soil water plant systems where the dissociation in soil and plant at relevant ph has been considered as an important factor carter et al 2014 goldstein et al 2014 hyland et al 2015a malchi et al 2014 this study aims to investigate the fate uptake and distribution of fifteen pharmaceuticals in soil radish systems radish plants grew in soil with the soil moisture levels at 75 60 and 45 of maximum water holding capacity mwhc which represent the common range of soil water content in agricultural field bcf values calculated on the basis of pharmaceuticals concentration in bulk soil vs in pore water were compared to gain more insight into the bioavailable fractions of pharmaceuticals in soil to plant root uptake the selected physicochemical properties of pharmaceuticals were evaluated to examine the relation to their uptake and translocation in plants this study provided experimental results to verify and improve the understanding of plant uptake of pharmaceuticals from soils in terms of pore water which delivers the useful information on the risk assessment of human exposure to pharmaceutical contaminated vegetables from the reuse of treated wastewater and biosolids in agriculture 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and materials acetaminophen caffeine

soil had a cation exchange capacity of 9 2 cmol kg the soil was air dried and passed through 2 mm sieve before use 2 2 experimental setup a mixture of the fifteen pharmaceuticals table 1 in acetone was spiked to soil 1 0 kg and thoroughly mixed in a fume hood after acetone was evaporated the soil with spiked pharmaceuticals was mixed thoroughly with 32 0 kg of clean soil using a motorized concrete mixer to achieve the final concentration of 1 μg g for each pharmaceutical five radish raphanus sativus seeds burpee co warminster pa were planted in each plastic pot containing 1 2 kg of the soil the pots were irrigated daily with deionized water to maintain water content at 75 60 and 45 of mwhc by monitoring the pot weights no additional fertilizer was added all experimental pots were prepared in triplicate including the pharmaceutical free and radish free controls the pots were randomly placed in a climate controlled greenhouse under sunlight at 25 c during daytime and 21 c during night after seed germination at day 8 the plants were thinned to two radish seedlings per pot for the radish free controls soil and pore water samples were collected at 4 h after irrigation at day 0 1

attached soil particles wiped with tissue paper and separated into roots including bulb and leaves plant samples were weighed cut into small pieces freeze dried and ground to fine powders all samples were stored at 20 c prior to extraction at the same time soil samples were also collected from the plant pots at day 28 and 35 for the analysis of pharmaceuticals in soil and pore water the ph of collected pore water was measured using a fisher scientific accumet ab15 ph meter pittsburgh pa usa 2 3 sample extraction and analysis pharmaceuticals in radish and soil samples were extracted using a modified quchers method chuang et al 2015 in brief dry radish 0 5 g or soil sample 2 5 g was placed in polypropylene centrifuge tube to which 2 0 ml of 150 mg l of na2edta was added with two pieces of

were added and vortexed for another 2 min the tubes were centrifuged at 2990 g for 10 min and 1 3 ml of supernatant was transferred into clean 1 5 ml centrifuge tubes containing 250 mg of na2so4 and d spe sorbents 25 mg of c18 and 25 mg of psa the samples were vortexed for 1 min and centrifuged at 9240 g for 10 min the supernatant was filtered through a 0 22 μm polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe filter and stored at 20 c prior to analysis soil pore water was collected immediately after soil sampling using the protocol described by carter et al 2014 briefly 25 g of soil was placed in a 20 ml disposable plastic syringe with a glass wool insert at the bottom the syringes were placed in 50 ml centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 4300 g for 40 min the collected pore water was passed through a

discussion 3 1 plant uptake radish grew well in the soil with water content at 75 60 and 45 of mwhc and appeared in good health the associated radish biomass showed no significant difference at the three water contents in the presence and absence of pharmaceuticals p 0 05 fig s1 the radish plants were separated into leaves and roots and analyzed individually for the accumulated pharmaceuticals table s4 all the pharmaceuticals except 17 β estradiol were detected in the radishes sampled at both day 28 and 35 pharmaceutical concentration in roots ranged from 2 4 to 1774 ng g carbamazepine demonstrated the highest accumulation which was up to 738 times greater than estrone the least accumulated compound in roots at day 35 in the leaves thirteen out of the fifteen pharmaceuticals except 17 β estradiol and monensin were detected with the concentration range of 2 1 14080 ng g carbamazepine caffeine lamotrigine and trimethoprim were measured at relatively high concentrations in leaves 462 14080 ng g while tylosin and estrone were detected at low concentrations 2 1 12 3 ng g monensin was found to accumulate predominantly in the roots with the minimal accumulation in the leaves pharmaceuticals accumulated in plants may be metabolized thus further influence their accumulation and distribution in plant organs in our previous study we found that 17 β estradiol sulfamethoxazole sulfadiazine estrone triclosan acetaminophen caffeine carbadox and lamotrigine were extensively metabolized in radish with the mass recoveries ranging from 3 0 to 32 1 after 7 days of hydroponic exposure li et al 2018 in some cases the amount of formed metabolites can even be greater than the accumulation of the parent compounds goldstein et al 2014 lefevre et al 2015 2017 macherius et al 2012a malchi et al 2014 riemenschneider et al 2017 for example macherius et al 2012a reported that the total amount of eight phase ii triclosan conjugates was about 5 times that of triclosan in carrot roots after two month growth in soil the transpiration stream is considered as the main driving force for uptake and transport of pharmaceuticals from soil to plants dodgen et al 2015 in this study the three common soil water contents 75 60 and 45 of mwhc did not have an apparent impact on the accumulation of pharmaceuticals in the radish tissues as shown in table s4 the concentrations of all detected pharmaceuticals except caffeine in radishes showed no significant difference p 0 05 among the three soil water contents this could be due to the factor that the water present in soil at the three soil water contents could be sufficient for radish growth and the variation in three soil water contents had barely impact on the water use efficiency by radishes this is evidenced by the fact that there was no significant difference in the amount of transpired water through the radish growing at the three soil water contents p 0 05 fig s2 as a result the uptake of pharmaceuticals from soil pore water could be similar and the corresponding bcfs or tf values at both harvesting times demonstrated no significant difference for all measured pharmaceuticals in radish growing at the three soil water contents p 0 05 figs s3 and s4 3 2 bioconcentration factor to better understand the accumulation potential of pharmaceuticals in radish from soil system the bcf values were calculated on the basis of pharmaceutical concentration in bulk soil bcfsoil and in soil pore water bcfpore water the bcf values were averaged across all radish samples growing at the three soil water contents n 9 and are shown in fig 1 the bcfpore water values ranged within 0 26 45 9 ml g and the bcfsoil values were within the range of 0 02 5 4 g g triclosan manifested the highest bcfpore water value 45 9 ml g at day 28 and acetaminophen had the greatest bcfsoil 5 4 g g at day 28 tylosin demonstrated the lowest bcfsoil and bcfpore water compared to the other pharmaceuticals other than the two sulfonamide antibiotics sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole the bcfpore water values of the pharmaceuticals were 1 2 423 and 1 3 281 times greater than their corresponding bcfsoil values at day 28 and 35 respectively the greater bcfpore water than bcfsoil values could be due to the less bioavailability of soil sorbed pharmaceuticals to radish root uptake than pharmaceuticals in soil pore water for the instance of triclosan the bcfsoil value was 0 12 g g at day 28 and its corresponding bcfpore water was 45 9 ml g the strong sorption of triclosan by soil k d 316 2 ml g could reduce the bioavailability of sorbed chemical resulting in the substantially diminished bcfsoil different soils manifest varying sorption for pharmaceuticals hence the bioavailability for plant uptake fu et al 2016b goldstein et al 2014 malchi et al 2014 for example the uptake of triclosan from soils by root vegetables such as radish and carrot demonstrated a wide range of bcfsoil from 0 12 to 6 6 g g carter et al 2014 fu et al 2016b macherius et al 2012b pannu et al 2012 prosser et al 2014 such difference in bcfsoil among the soils up to 55 times could be attributed mainly to the varying sorption by soils that leads to the different available fractions of triclosan in pore water to plant uptake the bcfsoil tends to be elusive as evidenced by that the chemical concentration in bulk soil does not reflect its bioavailability in soil hung et al 2009 and thus the bcfs of a pharmaceutical in different soils give no direct insight to the efficiency of pharmaceutical uptake by plants in contrast the concentration in pore water serves as a reasonable basis to evaluate the accumulation potential of pharmaceuticals in soil plant systems bcfpore water could also facilitate the comparison of pharmaceutical uptake by plant from soils by minimizing the effects of soil sorption to further clarify this point bcfsoil data of triclosan in radish from this test and a previous study were thus compared for five different soils fu et al 2016b as illustrated in fig s5 the bcfsoil of triclosan in radish roots varied among five soils by up to 17 5 times between bcfsoil 0 12 and 2 10 g g with the detailed data given in table s6 the corresponding bcfpore water data could be also obtained from fu et al 2016b by using bcfpore water bcfsoil k d where the k d values were provided from another study of the same soils fu et al 2016a as shown in fig s5 the triclosan bcfpore water values varied within a factor of 2 2 from 41 1 to 87 7 ml g among the five soils table s6 which sharply narrowed the variation compared to that of the corresponding bcfsoil data 3 3 relationship between pharmaceutical properties and root uptake the previous hydroponic studies suggested that the neutral form of organic chemicals generally favors root uptake briggs et al 1982 tanoue et al 2012 trapp 2000 wu et al 2013 to further characterize the relationship between the uptake and pharmaceutical properties in soil plant systems ph adjusted octanol water partition coefficient d ow was used to account for the lipophilicity of neutral speciation of pharmaceuticals in soil pore water table 1 both soil and pore water based log bcf values are plotted against log d ow for all studied pharmaceuticals the relationship of log bcfpore water vs log d ow r2 0 48 and log bcfsoil vs log d ow r2 0 04 are showed in fig 2 a and 2b these results suggest that partitioning of pharmaceuticals in neutral speciation is not the singular uptake driving force for the accumulation of the investigated pharmaceuticals in roots the ionic pharmaceutical species could also contribute to the uptake and accumulation in the radish roots root uptake of anionic chemicals could be inhibited by the negative electrical potential across plant cell membranes between 71 and 174 mv which might repulse anionic pharmaceuticals to approach the cell surfaces trapp 2009 in this study soil pore water ph value was 8 1 at which the majority of sulfadiazine 92 5 sulfamethoxazole 99 6 and monensin 100 were anionic thus limiting their penetration into plant cells as evidenced by a low bioaccumulation in radish roots bcfpore water 1 0 ml g carbadox acetaminophen and estrone were present in soil pore water primarily in neutral form 95 these chemicals could pass through the cell membrane resulting in relatively higher bcfpore water 1 5 ml g for carbadox log d ow 1 22 6 6 ml g for acetaminophen log d ow 0 44 and 23 1 ml g for estrone log d ow 3 13 cationic chemicals could be attracted to plant root cell membranes via electrostatic interaction with negatively charged plasmalemma inoue et al 1998 trapp 2009 ion trapping could enhance the accumulation of cationic pharmaceuticals in plants due to the alteration of chemical speciation in cell organelles trapp 2004 for example trimethoprim a weak organic base with pka 7 12 existed primarily in neutral form 90 in soil pore water ph 8 1 the neutral trimethoprim could easily enter plant root cells and be ionized in vacuole where ph is 5 5 trapp 2000 2009 the majority of trimethoprim is present as cationic species 97 in the vacuole and could be trapped in vacuole because it is less effective to cross the membranes this could be responsible for the observed relatively high accumulation of trimethoprim in roots bcfpore water 4 3 ml g in spite of its low log d ow 0 86 among the 14 pharmaceuticals measured in radish roots acetaminophen caffeine carbamazepine lamotrigine carbadox estrone and trimethoprim were present primarily in neutral form 90 in soil pore water a strong positive correlation was found between log bcfpore water and log d ow r 2 0 94 fig 2c suggesting that partitioning could be the primary factor affecting their accumulation in radish roots this is consistent with the findings from the previous study of uptake of neutral pharmaceuticals by vegetables from hydroponic solution wu et al 2013 hyland et al 2015b calculated the bcfs based on the chemical concentration in irrigation water and found the positive correlation between log bcf and log d ow for six pharmaceuticals and three flame retardants in both lettuce and strawberry roots grown in soils r 2 0 78 however in this study the poor relationship was observed between log bcfsoil and log d ow for these neutral pharmaceuticals r 2 0 03 fig 2d revealing that bcfpore water is more appropriate to describe the distribution of pharmaceuticals in soil water plant systems rather than the bulk soil based bcf in addition to charge speciation and hydrophobicity the bioaccumulation of pharmaceuticals could also be affected by chemical molecular weight mw plant physiology metabolism exposure time and plant growth rates etc for example mw is considered as another factor that associate with the membrane permeability kumar and gupta 2016 topp et al 1986 studies on diffusion have indicated that the compounds with mw 500 g mol have the restricted membrane permeability camenisch et al 1998 while the compounds with mw 1000 g mol are impossible to be absorbed by cells sanderson et al 2004 in this study the mw of 15 pharmaceuticals is in the range of 151 16 916 10 g mol table 1 among the 14 pharmaceuticals measured in radish 12 compounds have mw 500 g mol and 2 compounds with mw 500 g mol ten out of 12 compounds with mw 500 g mol acetaminophen caffeine carbamazepine lamotrigine estrone triclosan trimethoprim lincomycin and oxytetracycline had the greater bcfpore water 1 34 45 9 ml g than that of the 2 compounds with mw 500 g mol monensin and tylosin 0 26 1 0 ml g as shown in fig 2a tylosin with the highest mw 916 10 g mol showed the lowest bcf pore water 0 32 ml g even though most of this antibiotic was presented as neutral form 69 in soil pore water with intermediate lipophilicity log dow 1 47 the low bcf pore water of tylosin was also reported in lettuce 0 1 ml g and carrot 0 54 ml g boxall et al 2006 the relative high mw of tylosin might limitits permeability across the cell membranes plausibly accounting for the low bioaccumulation in vegetables 3 4 pharmaceuticals translocation many pharmaceuticals in plant roots can be transported upwards to aerial tissues via xylem driven by transpiration stream and the magnitude can be quantified by translocation factor tf in this study acetaminophen oxytetracycline triclosan and tylosin showed less translocation from roots to leaves with tf 1 fig 3 a monensin and 17 β estradiol were not detected in radish leaves the tf values for other nine pharmaceuticals were 1 indicating their strong translocation from roots to leaves no apparent relationship was observed between log tf and log d ow fig 3b this is consistent with the previous hydroponic study in which no correlation between log tf and log d ow was found for the pharmaceuticals with log d ow between 3 and 4 wu et al 2013 however tanoue et al 2012 observed that the root to leaf translocation is more effective for the pharmaceuticals with moderate hydrophobicity i e 1 log d ow 3 however our experimental results showed that the hydrophilic caffeine manifested the highest translocation tf 36 1 the relatively high transpiration stream concentration factor of caffeine could lead to the higher accumulation in plant leaves garvin et al 2015 the poor relationship between log tf and log d ow suggests that other factors could influence the translocation processes such as the electrostatic interaction with ionizable pharmaceuticals e g ion trapping plant physiology molecular size and in plant metabolism for example ion trapping may decrease the translocation of lamotrigine from roots to leaves carbamazepine and lamotrigine exhibit the similar log d ow 2 45 and 2 57 respectively and mw 236 27 and 256 10 g mol respectively both chemicals existed as neutral form in the pore water and had the similar bcfpore water 11 ml g however the tf of carbamazepine 8 0 was about 4 times greater than that of lamotrigine 2 0 lamotrigine is a weak organic base pka 5 34 after neutral species entered the root cells lamotrigine could be dissociated and accept protons in the cell vacuole ph 5 5 in the vacuoles 41 of lamotrigine was positively charged which could be trapped in vacuoles or interact with the negatively charged cell walls this process could largely reduce the translocation of lamotrigine to radish leaves compared to the neutral carbamazepine the less translocation of lamotrigine relative to carbamazepine was also observed in sweet potato carrot tomato and cucumber goldstein et al 2014 malchi et al 2014 goldstein et al 2018 demonstrated that the transpiration stream concentration factor of carbamazepine 0 7 0 9 in cucumber was about 4 6 times higher than that of lamotrigine 0 1 0 25 which is similar to the tf difference 4 times in radish between the two chemicals the tf values of intermediate hydrophobic compounds monensin log d ow 1 65 and tylosin log d ow 1 47 was 0 and 0 4 respectively which are much less than the predicted transport based on the hydrophobicity tanoue et al 2012 the relatively large sized monensin and tylosin with mw 500 g mol could limit their transport across the cell membrane and enter xylem hence decrease their accumulation in leaves limmer and burken 2014 3 5 pharmaceutical distribution in soil and relation to plant uptake the k d t 1 2 and residual fractions of pharmaceuticals at day 35 are reported in table 2 the tested soil demonstrated a range of sorption capacity for the fifteen pharmaceuticals as indicated by the k d values from 0 3 to 316 ml g the half lives ranged from 5 0 to 35 days and the concentration profiles of pharmaceuticals in bulk soil and pore water over time are plotted in fig s6 pharmaceutical with strong sorption to soil and or short half life is generally less bioavailable to plant uptake for example 17 β estradiol had relatively strong sorption to soil k d 34 9 ml g and a rapid degradation rate t1 2 7 5 days as a result little 17 β estradiol was found in radish in contrast carbamazepine was weakly sorbed by soil k d 4 2 ml g and highly persistent in soil t1 2 35 days 78 4 remained after 35 days therefore a large fraction of carbamazepine remained in soil and pore water which is readily available to root uptake leading to the relatively high accumulation of carbamazepine this could partially explain the high concentration of carbamazepine e g up to 400 ng g found in various vegetables irrigated with treated wastewater goldstein et al 2014 malchi et al 2014 paltiel et al 2016 wu et al 2014 soil pore water is the media to move pharmaceuticals into plants pharmaceutical concentration in soil pore water could be estimated using sorption cofficient k obtained from another independent batch equilibration experiment detailed in si in which cpore water csoil k chiou et al 2001 the k values used here were calculated from the slope of sorption isotherm of pharmaceutical by the tested soil fig s7 and table s6 to evaluate the impact of sorption and desorption of pharmaceuticals in soils to the uptake by radish the bcf pore water values were estimated using bcfsoil k and then compared to the measured bcf pore water fig 4 the predicted bcfpore water values are within 3 0 times of the measured bcfpore water for the measured pharmaceuticals at both day 28 and 35 except for estrone and lincomycin are within 3 0 5 5 times of difference recall that the measurement of sorption isotherm to obtain k values was equilibrated for 48 h while plant uptake experiment was conducted for 35 days the sorption of pharmaceuticals in the pot experiments without plant at different sampling intervals during the 35 day studies are also compared to the 48 h sorption equilibration isotherms fig s7 the results revealed that distribution of most pharmaceuticals between soil and water in the 35 day study is similar to the sorption of 48 h equilibration the good agreement between the measured and the predicted bcfpore water indicates that soil sorbed pharmaceuticals could quickly establish sorption desorption equilibrium with soil pore water 48 h therefore pharmaceutical desorption from soil is not the limiting factor governing the uptake of pharmaceuticals from soil to radish these results provide the basis for assuming the fast sorption equilibration of pharmaceuticals between soil and pore water when modeling the movement of pharmaceuticals from soil to pore water for plant uptake 4 conclusion this study reveals that pharmaceuticals could enter plant from contaminated soil and sorption and biodegradation in soil are the determinants of the bioavailable amounts of pharmaceuticals to plant uptake the comparison of the bulk soil based bcfsoil and pore water based bcfpore water suggests that the pharmaceuticals in pore water represent the more effective fractions for plant uptake than those sorbed by soil in addition the good positive correlation r2 0 93 between logbcfpore water and logd ow vs the poor correlation between logbcfsoil and logd ow r2 0 03 for neutral pharmaceuticals indicate that pharmaceuticals in pore water is more appropriate for developing the relationships to predict the accumulation in plants we therefore highly recommend bcfpore water instead of bcfsoil be used to evaluate the distribution of pharmaceuticals in soil plant systems anionic pharmaceuticals generally showed less uptake than neutral pharmaceuticals ion trapping effects may enhance the accumulation of basic pharmaceuticals in the roots but limit the transport to leaves our results indicate that pharmaceutical in pore water is an important factor to control their uptake by food crops from contaminated agricultural soils the results help to better understand the common processes of pharmaceutical transport and distribution in soil water plant systems through land application of biosolids or animal manure however the experiment may not well mimic the processes of plant uptake of pharmaceuticals via irrigation with treated wastewater the human dietary intake of these pharmaceuticals via radishes seems to be small as the measured amounts are much lower than the amount of single medical dose usually in the range of 10 200 mg per pill however little is known about the long term risks of exposure to a mixture of pharmaceuticals and metabolites therefore more studies are still needed to warrant better understanding of pharmaceutical transport uptake and metabolism in soil plant systems declaration of interests

19027,pharmaceuticals in agricultural soils originating from irrigation with treated wastewater and land applied biosolids can enter field crops however little is known about the role of pore water in plant uptake of pharmaceuticals from soils in this study the fate uptake and distribution of fifteen commonly used pharmaceuticals in soil water radish systems were investigated to examine the relationship between the accumulation and their physicochemical processes in soils the results indicate that the distribution of pharmaceuticals between soil and pore water as well as their biodegradation combined to govern the bioavailability of pharmaceuticals to plant uptake fourteen out of 15 pharmaceuticals could enter radish tissues in which the accumulation ranged from 2 1 to 14080 ng g comparison of bioconcentration factors bcfs on the basis of pharmaceutical concentration in bulk soil vs in pore water implies that pharmaceuticals present in soil pore water are the major bioavailable fractions to plant uptake the pore water based bcfs exhibited a positive linear relationship with log d ow for the pharmaceuticals with 90 as neutral species in soil pore water while such relationship was not observed between bulk soil based bcfs and log d ow mainly due to sorption by soil other than hydrophobicity the dissociation of ionizable pharmaceuticals in the soil pore water and or root cells may lead to the ion trap effects and thus influence the uptake and translocation process the large molecular size pharmaceuticals e g tylosin manifested a minimum uptake due plausibly to the limited permeability of cell membranes graphical abstract image 1 keywords plant uptake soil pore water bioavailability bioaccumulation translocation 1 introduction some pharmaceuticals have been recognized as chemicals of emerging concern because they are widespread in the environment and have the potential adverse effects on non target organisms and humans e g endocrine disruption and preservation of antibiotic resistance carvalho et al 2014 daughton and ternes 1999 kolpin et al 2002 madikizela et al 2018 conventional wastewater treatment processes cannot effectively remove all pharmaceuticals from the influents leaving the pharmaceuticals in the effluents at the levels of ng l to low μg l gros et al 2010 sui et al 2011 vanderford and snyder 2006 and in biosolids at μg kg to low mg kg dry weight clarke and smith 2011 mcclellan and halden 2010 irrigation with the treated wastewater and land application of biosolids are common agricultural practices which lead to the dissemination of a wide range of pharmaceuticals in agricultural soils with concentration up to mg kg levels carter et al 2014 durán alvarez et al 2009 kinney et al 2006 vazquez roig et al 2010 for example land application of biosolids at a rate of 5 kg m2 caused triclosan concentration of 0 77 0 95 mg kg in the farm soils located in bedfordshire uk butler et al 2012 one major consequence of the soil contamination is that these pharmaceuticals could enter food chain after plant uptake and pose potential risks to human and animal health via dietary consumption christou et al 2017 de boer et al 2018 sallach et al 2015 wu et al 2014 paltiel et al 2016 recently found that carbamazepine and its metabolites were detected in human urine after consuming the fresh produce irrigated with treated wastewater in soil plant systems the amount of organic chemical uptake by plant roots depends largely on sorption desorption of contaminants in soils and their physicochemical properties it is assumed that organic chemicals present in soil pore water are readily bioavailable to plant uptake miller et al 2016 and soil water serves as the carrier to move the chemicals into plants the distribution of pharmaceuticals in soil water plant systems is commonly characterized by bioconcentration factor bcf which is typically calculated as the ratio of pharmaceutical concentration in plant to that in bulk soil hurtado et al 2016 karnjanapiboonwong et al 2011 pan et al 2014 shenker et al 2011 wu et al 2010 however pharmaceuticals present in soil pore water vs sorb by soil could manifest different bioavailability to plant uptake therefore bcfs calculated on the basis of pharmaceutical concentration in bulk soil are not comparable among the studies using different soils because of the varying affinities of pharmaceuticals to soils for instance soil based bcfs of seven benzodiazepines in radish could vary by up to 86 0 times between two soils carter et al 2018 the difference of soil based bcfs between three soils for caffeine carbamazepine and lamotrigine in tomato or cucumber can up to 20 7 8 and 245 times respectively goldstein et al 2014 in fact bcfs calculated by pharmaceutical concentration in soil pore water are believed to provide more accurate information to describe the uptake process since pharmaceuticals in soil pore water are directly available to plant roots for example blaine et al 2014 used pore water based bcfs of perfluoroalkyl acids in four vegetables grown in soils to explore the relationship between bioaccumulation and chemical properties and found the consistent results with the vegetables grown in hydroponic solution but not for soil based bcfs despite numerous greenhouse and field studies that have been conducted very limited studies were conducted to systematically evaluate the contribution of pharmaceuticals in soil pore water to the bioaccumulation in plants boxall et al 2006 carter et al 2014 water is believed to carry xenobiotic chemicals e g pharmaceuticals to cross plant root cortex by symplastic intracellular space and apoplastic extracellular space pathways mcfarlane and trapp 1994 trapp and pussemier 1991 in plant roots casparian strip composing primarily of hydrophobic suberin and lignin functions as a water impermeable barrier to prevent water and pharmaceuticals from passing through the endodermis via the apoplastic route naseer et al 2012 schreiber 2010 therefore pharmaceuticals have to reenter the symplastic pathway to cross cell membranes and enter the xylem for many nonionic organic compounds the accumulation in plants is positively related to their lipophilicity as indicated by the linear relationship between bcfs and octanol water partition coefficient k ow briggs et al 1982 1983 however plant uptake of ionic compounds is determined by the combination of hydrophobicity chemical speciation and surrounding solution ph briggs et al 1987 trapp 2000 most pharmaceuticals are ionizable compounds and have low hydrophobicity e g log d ow 2 therefore the relations developed for nonionic organic contaminants may not be applicable to the uptake of pharmaceuticals for example no apparent relationship was observed between log bcf and log d ow ph adjusted k ow to neutral species for 20 pharmaceuticals including acids bases and neutral compounds in hydroponically grown lettuce spinach cucumber and pepper wu et al 2013 however strong correlations were observed when the data were limited to neutral pharmaceuticals the relationship between plant uptake of ionic pharmaceuticals and their physicochemical properties still remain largely unknown in the complex soil water plant systems where the dissociation in soil and plant at relevant ph has been considered as an important factor carter et al 2014 goldstein et al 2014 hyland et al 2015a malchi et al 2014 this study aims to investigate the fate uptake and distribution of fifteen pharmaceuticals in soil radish systems radish plants grew in soil with the soil moisture levels at 75 60 and 45 of maximum water holding capacity mwhc which represent the common range of soil water content in agricultural field bcf values calculated on the basis of pharmaceuticals concentration in bulk soil vs in pore water were compared to gain more insight into the bioavailable fractions of pharmaceuticals in soil to plant root uptake the selected physicochemical properties of pharmaceuticals were evaluated to examine the relation to their uptake and translocation in plants this study provided experimental results to verify and improve the understanding of plant uptake of pharmaceuticals from soils in terms of pore water which delivers the useful information on the risk assessment of human exposure to pharmaceutical contaminated vegetables from the reuse of treated wastewater and biosolids in agriculture 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals and materials acetaminophen caffeine

soil had a cation exchange capacity of 9 2 cmol kg the soil was air dried and passed through 2 mm sieve before use 2 2 experimental setup a mixture of the fifteen pharmaceuticals table 1 in acetone was spiked to soil 1 0 kg and thoroughly mixed in a fume hood after acetone was evaporated the soil with spiked pharmaceuticals was mixed thoroughly with 32 0 kg of clean soil using a motorized concrete mixer to achieve the final concentration of 1 μg g for each pharmaceutical five radish raphanus sativus seeds burpee co warminster pa were planted in each plastic pot containing 1 2 kg of the soil the pots were irrigated daily with deionized water to maintain water content at 75 60 and 45 of mwhc by monitoring the pot weights no additional fertilizer was added all experimental pots were prepared in triplicate including the pharmaceutical free and radish free controls the pots were randomly placed in a climate controlled greenhouse under sunlight at 25 c during daytime and 21 c during night after seed germination at day 8 the plants were thinned to two radish seedlings per pot for the radish free controls soil and pore water samples were collected at 4 h after irrigation at day 0 1

attached soil particles wiped with tissue paper and separated into roots including bulb and leaves plant samples were weighed cut into small pieces freeze dried and ground to fine powders all samples were stored at 20 c prior to extraction at the same time soil samples were also collected from the plant pots at day 28 and 35 for the analysis of pharmaceuticals in soil and pore water the ph of collected pore water was measured using a fisher scientific accumet ab15 ph meter pittsburgh pa usa 2 3 sample extraction and analysis pharmaceuticals in radish and soil samples were extracted using a modified quchers method chuang et al 2015 in brief dry radish 0 5 g or soil sample 2 5 g was placed in polypropylene centrifuge tube to which 2 0 ml of 150 mg l of na2edta was added with two pieces of

were added and vortexed for another 2 min the tubes were centrifuged at 2990 g for 10 min and 1 3 ml of supernatant was transferred into clean 1 5 ml centrifuge tubes containing 250 mg of na2so4 and d spe sorbents 25 mg of c18 and 25 mg of psa the samples were vortexed for 1 min and centrifuged at 9240 g for 10 min the supernatant was filtered through a 0 22 μm polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe filter and stored at 20 c prior to analysis soil pore water was collected immediately after soil sampling using the protocol described by carter et al 2014 briefly 25 g of soil was placed in a 20 ml disposable plastic syringe with a glass wool insert at the bottom the syringes were placed in 50 ml centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 4300 g for 40 min the collected pore water was passed through a

discussion 3 1 plant uptake radish grew well in the soil with water content at 75 60 and 45 of mwhc and appeared in good health the associated radish biomass showed no significant difference at the three water contents in the presence and absence of pharmaceuticals p 0 05 fig s1 the radish plants were separated into leaves and roots and analyzed individually for the accumulated pharmaceuticals table s4 all the pharmaceuticals except 17 β estradiol were detected in the radishes sampled at both day 28 and 35 pharmaceutical concentration in roots ranged from 2 4 to 1774 ng g carbamazepine demonstrated the highest accumulation which was up to 738 times greater than estrone the least accumulated compound in roots at day 35 in the leaves thirteen out of the fifteen pharmaceuticals except 17 β estradiol and monensin were detected with the concentration range of 2 1 14080 ng g carbamazepine caffeine lamotrigine and trimethoprim were measured at relatively high concentrations in leaves 462 14080 ng g while tylosin and estrone were detected at low concentrations 2 1 12 3 ng g monensin was found to accumulate predominantly in the roots with the minimal accumulation in the leaves pharmaceuticals accumulated in plants may be metabolized thus further influence their accumulation and distribution in plant organs in our previous study we found that 17 β estradiol sulfamethoxazole sulfadiazine estrone triclosan acetaminophen caffeine carbadox and lamotrigine were extensively metabolized in radish with the mass recoveries ranging from 3 0 to 32 1 after 7 days of hydroponic exposure li et al 2018 in some cases the amount of formed metabolites can even be greater than the accumulation of the parent compounds goldstein et al 2014 lefevre et al 2015 2017 macherius et al 2012a malchi et al 2014 riemenschneider et al 2017 for example macherius et al 2012a reported that the total amount of eight phase ii triclosan conjugates was about 5 times that of triclosan in carrot roots after two month growth in soil the transpiration stream is considered as the main driving force for uptake and transport of pharmaceuticals from soil to plants dodgen et al 2015 in this study the three common soil water contents 75 60 and 45 of mwhc did not have an apparent impact on the accumulation of pharmaceuticals in the radish tissues as shown in table s4 the concentrations of all detected pharmaceuticals except caffeine in radishes showed no significant difference p 0 05 among the three soil water contents this could be due to the factor that the water present in soil at the three soil water contents could be sufficient for radish growth and the variation in three soil water contents had barely impact on the water use efficiency by radishes this is evidenced by the fact that there was no significant difference in the amount of transpired water through the radish growing at the three soil water contents p 0 05 fig s2 as a result the uptake of pharmaceuticals from soil pore water could be similar and the corresponding bcfs or tf values at both harvesting times demonstrated no significant difference for all measured pharmaceuticals in radish growing at the three soil water contents p 0 05 figs s3 and s4 3 2 bioconcentration factor to better understand the accumulation potential of pharmaceuticals in radish from soil system the bcf values were calculated on the basis of pharmaceutical concentration in bulk soil bcfsoil and in soil pore water bcfpore water the bcf values were averaged across all radish samples growing at the three soil water contents n 9 and are shown in fig 1 the bcfpore water values ranged within 0 26 45 9 ml g and the bcfsoil values were within the range of 0 02 5 4 g g triclosan manifested the highest bcfpore water value 45 9 ml g at day 28 and acetaminophen had the greatest bcfsoil 5 4 g g at day 28 tylosin demonstrated the lowest bcfsoil and bcfpore water compared to the other pharmaceuticals other than the two sulfonamide antibiotics sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole the bcfpore water values of the pharmaceuticals were 1 2 423 and 1 3 281 times greater than their corresponding bcfsoil values at day 28 and 35 respectively the greater bcfpore water than bcfsoil values could be due to the less bioavailability of soil sorbed pharmaceuticals to radish root uptake than pharmaceuticals in soil pore water for the instance of triclosan the bcfsoil value was 0 12 g g at day 28 and its corresponding bcfpore water was 45 9 ml g the strong sorption of triclosan by soil k d 316 2 ml g could reduce the bioavailability of sorbed chemical resulting in the substantially diminished bcfsoil different soils manifest varying sorption for pharmaceuticals hence the bioavailability for plant uptake fu et al 2016b goldstein et al 2014 malchi et al 2014 for example the uptake of triclosan from soils by root vegetables such as radish and carrot demonstrated a wide range of bcfsoil from 0 12 to 6 6 g g carter et al 2014 fu et al 2016b macherius et al 2012b pannu et al 2012 prosser et al 2014 such difference in bcfsoil among the soils up to 55 times could be attributed mainly to the varying sorption by soils that leads to the different available fractions of triclosan in pore water to plant uptake the bcfsoil tends to be elusive as evidenced by that the chemical concentration in bulk soil does not reflect its bioavailability in soil hung et al 2009 and thus the bcfs of a pharmaceutical in different soils give no direct insight to the efficiency of pharmaceutical uptake by plants in contrast the concentration in pore water serves as a reasonable basis to evaluate the accumulation potential of pharmaceuticals in soil plant systems bcfpore water could also facilitate the comparison of pharmaceutical uptake by plant from soils by minimizing the effects of soil sorption to further clarify this point bcfsoil data of triclosan in radish from this test and a previous study were thus compared for five different soils fu et al 2016b as illustrated in fig s5 the bcfsoil of triclosan in radish roots varied among five soils by up to 17 5 times between bcfsoil 0 12 and 2 10 g g with the detailed data given in table s6 the corresponding bcfpore water data could be also obtained from fu et al 2016b by using bcfpore water bcfsoil k d where the k d values were provided from another study of the same soils fu et al 2016a as shown in fig s5 the triclosan bcfpore water values varied within a factor of 2 2 from 41 1 to 87 7 ml g among the five soils table s6 which sharply narrowed the variation compared to that of the corresponding bcfsoil data 3 3 relationship between pharmaceutical properties and root uptake the previous hydroponic studies suggested that the neutral form of organic chemicals generally favors root uptake briggs et al 1982 tanoue et al 2012 trapp 2000 wu et al 2013 to further characterize the relationship between the uptake and pharmaceutical properties in soil plant systems ph adjusted octanol water partition coefficient d ow was used to account for the lipophilicity of neutral speciation of pharmaceuticals in soil pore water table 1 both soil and pore water based log bcf values are plotted against log d ow for all studied pharmaceuticals the relationship of log bcfpore water vs log d ow r2 0 48 and log bcfsoil vs log d ow r2 0 04 are showed in fig 2 a and 2b these results suggest that partitioning of pharmaceuticals in neutral speciation is not the singular uptake driving force for the accumulation of the investigated pharmaceuticals in roots the ionic pharmaceutical species could also contribute to the uptake and accumulation in the radish roots root uptake of anionic chemicals could be inhibited by the negative electrical potential across plant cell membranes between 71 and 174 mv which might repulse anionic pharmaceuticals to approach the cell surfaces trapp 2009 in this study soil pore water ph value was 8 1 at which the majority of sulfadiazine 92 5 sulfamethoxazole 99 6 and monensin 100 were anionic thus limiting their penetration into plant cells as evidenced by a low bioaccumulation in radish roots bcfpore water 1 0 ml g carbadox acetaminophen and estrone were present in soil pore water primarily in neutral form 95 these chemicals could pass through the cell membrane resulting in relatively higher bcfpore water 1 5 ml g for carbadox log d ow 1 22 6 6 ml g for acetaminophen log d ow 0 44 and 23 1 ml g for estrone log d ow 3 13 cationic chemicals could be attracted to plant root cell membranes via electrostatic interaction with negatively charged plasmalemma inoue et al 1998 trapp 2009 ion trapping could enhance the accumulation of cationic pharmaceuticals in plants due to the alteration of chemical speciation in cell organelles trapp 2004 for example trimethoprim a weak organic base with pka 7 12 existed primarily in neutral form 90 in soil pore water ph 8 1 the neutral trimethoprim could easily enter plant root cells and be ionized in vacuole where ph is 5 5 trapp 2000 2009 the majority of trimethoprim is present as cationic species 97 in the vacuole and could be trapped in vacuole because it is less effective to cross the membranes this could be responsible for the observed relatively high accumulation of trimethoprim in roots bcfpore water 4 3 ml g in spite of its low log d ow 0 86 among the 14 pharmaceuticals measured in radish roots acetaminophen caffeine carbamazepine lamotrigine carbadox estrone and trimethoprim were present primarily in neutral form 90 in soil pore water a strong positive correlation was found between log bcfpore water and log d ow r 2 0 94 fig 2c suggesting that partitioning could be the primary factor affecting their accumulation in radish roots this is consistent with the findings from the previous study of uptake of neutral pharmaceuticals by vegetables from hydroponic solution wu et al 2013 hyland et al 2015b calculated the bcfs based on the chemical concentration in irrigation water and found the positive correlation between log bcf and log d ow for six pharmaceuticals and three flame retardants in both lettuce and strawberry roots grown in soils r 2 0 78 however in this study the poor relationship was observed between log bcfsoil and log d ow for these neutral pharmaceuticals r 2 0 03 fig 2d revealing that bcfpore water is more appropriate to describe the distribution of pharmaceuticals in soil water plant systems rather than the bulk soil based bcf in addition to charge speciation and hydrophobicity the bioaccumulation of pharmaceuticals could also be affected by chemical molecular weight mw plant physiology metabolism exposure time and plant growth rates etc for example mw is considered as another factor that associate with the membrane permeability kumar and gupta 2016 topp et al 1986 studies on diffusion have indicated that the compounds with mw 500 g mol have the restricted membrane permeability camenisch et al 1998 while the compounds with mw 1000 g mol are impossible to be absorbed by cells sanderson et al 2004 in this study the mw of 15 pharmaceuticals is in the range of 151 16 916 10 g mol table 1 among the 14 pharmaceuticals measured in radish 12 compounds have mw 500 g mol and 2 compounds with mw 500 g mol ten out of 12 compounds with mw 500 g mol acetaminophen caffeine carbamazepine lamotrigine estrone triclosan trimethoprim lincomycin and oxytetracycline had the greater bcfpore water 1 34 45 9 ml g than that of the 2 compounds with mw 500 g mol monensin and tylosin 0 26 1 0 ml g as shown in fig 2a tylosin with the highest mw 916 10 g mol showed the lowest bcf pore water 0 32 ml g even though most of this antibiotic was presented as neutral form 69 in soil pore water with intermediate lipophilicity log dow 1 47 the low bcf pore water of tylosin was also reported in lettuce 0 1 ml g and carrot 0 54 ml g boxall et al 2006 the relative high mw of tylosin might limitits permeability across the cell membranes plausibly accounting for the low bioaccumulation in vegetables 3 4 pharmaceuticals translocation many pharmaceuticals in plant roots can be transported upwards to aerial tissues via xylem driven by transpiration stream and the magnitude can be quantified by translocation factor tf in this study acetaminophen oxytetracycline triclosan and tylosin showed less translocation from roots to leaves with tf 1 fig 3 a monensin and 17 β estradiol were not detected in radish leaves the tf values for other nine pharmaceuticals were 1 indicating their strong translocation from roots to leaves no apparent relationship was observed between log tf and log d ow fig 3b this is consistent with the previous hydroponic study in which no correlation between log tf and log d ow was found for the pharmaceuticals with log d ow between 3 and 4 wu et al 2013 however tanoue et al 2012 observed that the root to leaf translocation is more effective for the pharmaceuticals with moderate hydrophobicity i e 1 log d ow 3 however our experimental results showed that the hydrophilic caffeine manifested the highest translocation tf 36 1 the relatively high transpiration stream concentration factor of caffeine could lead to the higher accumulation in plant leaves garvin et al 2015 the poor relationship between log tf and log d ow suggests that other factors could influence the translocation processes such as the electrostatic interaction with ionizable pharmaceuticals e g ion trapping plant physiology molecular size and in plant metabolism for example ion trapping may decrease the translocation of lamotrigine from roots to leaves carbamazepine and lamotrigine exhibit the similar log d ow 2 45 and 2 57 respectively and mw 236 27 and 256 10 g mol respectively both chemicals existed as neutral form in the pore water and had the similar bcfpore water 11 ml g however the tf of carbamazepine 8 0 was about 4 times greater than that of lamotrigine 2 0 lamotrigine is a weak organic base pka 5 34 after neutral species entered the root cells lamotrigine could be dissociated and accept protons in the cell vacuole ph 5 5 in the vacuoles 41 of lamotrigine was positively charged which could be trapped in vacuoles or interact with the negatively charged cell walls this process could largely reduce the translocation of lamotrigine to radish leaves compared to the neutral carbamazepine the less translocation of lamotrigine relative to carbamazepine was also observed in sweet potato carrot tomato and cucumber goldstein et al 2014 malchi et al 2014 goldstein et al 2018 demonstrated that the transpiration stream concentration factor of carbamazepine 0 7 0 9 in cucumber was about 4 6 times higher than that of lamotrigine 0 1 0 25 which is similar to the tf difference 4 times in radish between the two chemicals the tf values of intermediate hydrophobic compounds monensin log d ow 1 65 and tylosin log d ow 1 47 was 0 and 0 4 respectively which are much less than the predicted transport based on the hydrophobicity tanoue et al 2012 the relatively large sized monensin and tylosin with mw 500 g mol could limit their transport across the cell membrane and enter xylem hence decrease their accumulation in leaves limmer and burken 2014 3 5 pharmaceutical distribution in soil and relation to plant uptake the k d t 1 2 and residual fractions of pharmaceuticals at day 35 are reported in table 2 the tested soil demonstrated a range of sorption capacity for the fifteen pharmaceuticals as indicated by the k d values from 0 3 to 316 ml g the half lives ranged from 5 0 to 35 days and the concentration profiles of pharmaceuticals in bulk soil and pore water over time are plotted in fig s6 pharmaceutical with strong sorption to soil and or short half life is generally less bioavailable to plant uptake for example 17 β estradiol had relatively strong sorption to soil k d 34 9 ml g and a rapid degradation rate t1 2 7 5 days as a result little 17 β estradiol was found in radish in contrast carbamazepine was weakly sorbed by soil k d 4 2 ml g and highly persistent in soil t1 2 35 days 78 4 remained after 35 days therefore a large fraction of carbamazepine remained in soil and pore water which is readily available to root uptake leading to the relatively high accumulation of carbamazepine this could partially explain the high concentration of carbamazepine e g up to 400 ng g found in various vegetables irrigated with treated wastewater goldstein et al 2014 malchi et al 2014 paltiel et al 2016 wu et al 2014 soil pore water is the media to move pharmaceuticals into plants pharmaceutical concentration in soil pore water could be estimated using sorption cofficient k obtained from another independent batch equilibration experiment detailed in si in which cpore water csoil k chiou et al 2001 the k values used here were calculated from the slope of sorption isotherm of pharmaceutical by the tested soil fig s7 and table s6 to evaluate the impact of sorption and desorption of pharmaceuticals in soils to the uptake by radish the bcf pore water values were estimated using bcfsoil k and then compared to the measured bcf pore water fig 4 the predicted bcfpore water values are within 3 0 times of the measured bcfpore water for the measured pharmaceuticals at both day 28 and 35 except for estrone and lincomycin are within 3 0 5 5 times of difference recall that the measurement of sorption isotherm to obtain k values was equilibrated for 48 h while plant uptake experiment was conducted for 35 days the sorption of pharmaceuticals in the pot experiments without plant at different sampling intervals during the 35 day studies are also compared to the 48 h sorption equilibration isotherms fig s7 the results revealed that distribution of most pharmaceuticals between soil and water in the 35 day study is similar to the sorption of 48 h equilibration the good agreement between the measured and the predicted bcfpore water indicates that soil sorbed pharmaceuticals could quickly establish sorption desorption equilibrium with soil pore water 48 h therefore pharmaceutical desorption from soil is not the limiting factor governing the uptake of pharmaceuticals from soil to radish these results provide the basis for assuming the fast sorption equilibration of pharmaceuticals between soil and pore water when modeling the movement of pharmaceuticals from soil to pore water for plant uptake 4 conclusion this study reveals that pharmaceuticals could enter plant from contaminated soil and sorption and biodegradation in soil are the determinants of the bioavailable amounts of pharmaceuticals to plant uptake the comparison of the bulk soil based bcfsoil and pore water based bcfpore water suggests that the pharmaceuticals in pore water represent the more effective fractions for plant uptake than those sorbed by soil in addition the good positive correlation r2 0 93 between logbcfpore water and logd ow vs the poor correlation between logbcfsoil and logd ow r2 0 03 for neutral pharmaceuticals indicate that pharmaceuticals in pore water is more appropriate for developing the relationships to predict the accumulation in plants we therefore highly recommend bcfpore water instead of bcfsoil be used to evaluate the distribution of pharmaceuticals in soil plant systems anionic pharmaceuticals generally showed less uptake than neutral pharmaceuticals ion trapping effects may enhance the accumulation of basic pharmaceuticals in the roots but limit the transport to leaves our results indicate that pharmaceutical in pore water is an important factor to control their uptake by food crops from contaminated agricultural soils the results help to better understand the common processes of pharmaceutical transport and distribution in soil water plant systems through land application of biosolids or animal manure however the experiment may not well mimic the processes of plant uptake of pharmaceuticals via irrigation with treated wastewater the human dietary intake of these pharmaceuticals via radishes seems to be small as the measured amounts are much lower than the amount of single medical dose usually in the range of 10 200 mg per pill however little is known about the long term risks of exposure to a mixture of pharmaceuticals and metabolites therefore more studies are still needed to warrant better understanding of pharmaceutical transport uptake and metabolism in soil plant systems declaration of interests

19028,in the growing field of capacitive deionization cdi a number of performance metrics have emerged to describe the desalination process unfortunately the separation conditions under which these metrics are measured are often not specified resulting in optimal performance at minimal removal here we outline a system of performance metrics and reporting conditions that resolves this issue our proposed system is based on volumetric energy consumption wh m3 and throughput productivity l h m2 reported for a specific average concentration reduction water recovery and feed salinity to facilitate and rationalize comparisons between devices materials and operation modes we propose a nominal standard separation of removing 5 mm from a 20 mm nacl feed solution at 50 water recovery we propose this particular separation as a standard but emphasize that the rationale presented here applies irrespective of separation details using our proposed separation we compare the desalination performance of a flow through electrode fte cdi cell and a flow between membrane fb mcdi device showing how significantly different systems can be compared in terms of generally desirable desalination characteristics in general we find that performance analysis must be considered carefully so to not allow for ambiguous separation conditions or the maximization of one metric at the expense of another additionally for context and clarity we discuss a number of important underlying performance indicators and cell characteristics that are not performance measures in and of themselves but can be examined to better understand differences in performance graphical abstract image 1 keywords capacitive desalination capacitive deionization cdi performance 1 introduction capacitive deionization cdi encompasses a group of water desalination technologies that uses cyclic charging and discharging of electrodes and the resulting electrosorption of ions to deplete or enrich a feed water stream biesheuvel et al 2017 interest in cdi has grown substantially in recent years with currently more than 150 publications annually reporting on the topic zhang et al 2018 as often occurs in a growing device research field a need has emerged for establishing guidelines for evaluating reporting and comparing device performance balducci et al 2017 khenkin et al 2018 gogotsi and simon 2011 brousse et al 2015 editorial 2015 zuliani et al 2015 at present much of the work in cdi focuses on materials and methods to improve the efficiency and desalination capacity of the system but many published studies are actually not comparable to one another this is primarily because either certain critical performance parameters are not reported or the desalination conditions explored are different in some substantial aspect for desalination technologies such as reverse osmosis ro or electrodialysis ed performance metrics typically include energy consumption per volume of dilute effluent and a volume throughput parameter cohen tanugi et al 2014 park et al 2017 alvarado and chen 2014 pan et al 2017 this set of metrics is sufficient for comparison between removal methods only when the water recovery wr feed salinity and total concentration reduction are the same park et al 2017 in other words energy and throughput metrics alone are insufficient to provide a comparable description of performance because these values depend critically on the separation conditions achieving comparable separation conditions in cdi is particularly difficult because the method usually removes a smaller highly variable fraction of the ions since extrapolating results from one set of removal conditions to another is not straightforward it is critical to control for the feed salinity concentration reduction and water recovery in a performance evaluation to add to the complexity of the cdi performance landscape the community has turned to a number of metrics to describe its desalination process some commonly used energy throughput and materials metrics in cdi are the salt adsorption capacity sac in mg g of electrodes average salt adsorption rate asar in mol min cm2 or in mg g min zhao et al 2013b kim and yoon 2015 hemmatifar et al 2016 hawks et al 2018 wang and lin 2018 energy consumption per mole of salt removed in kj mol kj g or k t ion zhao et al 2012 qu et al 2016 suss et al 2015 shang et al 2017 energy normalized adsorbed salt enas in μmol j hemmatifar et al 2016 hawks et al 2018 oyarzun et al 2018 and specific energy consumption sec 1 in mg j wang and lin 2018 while these metrics may be insightful for the processes relevant to cdi it would be beneficial to settle upon a minimum necessary set of measures that reflect economically relevant desalination performance additionally it is important to distinguish between throughput and energy consumption as these different desalination aspects often trade off with one another indeed several studies have shown that sac asar and enas for example are highly coupled with clear tradeoffs among them hemmatifar et al 2016 kim and yoon 2015 hawks et al 2018 wang and lin 2018 for instance adsorption rate can be increased at the cost of higher energy consumption or lower sac hemmatifar et al 2016 kim and yoon 2015 thus both an energy and a throughput metric must be reported for a given separation in order to fully define performance with these considerations in mind herein we present a framework for objectively comparing desalination performance in capacitive based removal systems along with an example standardized deionization protocol for cdi research we also discuss the relation between the proposed parameters and their typically used traditional counterparts our goal here is to create a framework by which generic economically relevant desalination capability can be evaluated for a given separation with any cdi type approach to highlight how this framework can be implemented we propose a standard protocol that can be reasonably followed for both large and small laboratory scale devices with the intent of facilitating study to study comparisons in cdi research hence for example our procedure does not prescribe flow rates charging methods device size electrode configuration or even removal mechanism for context we also distinguish between performance metrics and performance indicators where metrics are meant to reflect generic desalination performance and indicators are used to better understand why a certain performance was achieved since understanding the reasons behind differences in performance is vitally important to technological progress we discuss a number of performance indicators and highlight the essential cell characteristics that underlie many of these results 2 framework for comparing deionization performance our proposed approach to evaluating desalination performance of a cdi system is pictographically shown in fig 1 first and most importantly a target separation must be defined which includes the feed salt concentration c feed the concentration reduction after treatment δ c and the water recovery w r with these conditions defined the desalination performance can be evaluated by examining the energy consumed per cubic meter of diluate e v in wh m3 and the throughput productivity p in l h m2 where the area unit in p corresponds to the projected face area of a typical device i e the face area over which electrodes overlap see fig s2 in the supporting information or projected face area of the membranes in a flow electrode cell cohen tanugi et al 2014 pan et al 2017 doornbusch et al 2016 these performance metrics are defined quantitatively below for dynamic steady state dss cycling but pertain to any operation mode e g batch flow electrode etc by controlling for the separation conditions new materials huang et al 2017 device geometries suss et al 2015 electrode configurations mubita et al 2018 qu et al 2018 and operation modes qu et al 2016 dykstra et al 2018 garcía quismondo et al 2016 ramachandran et al 2018a can be objectively compared to one and other in terms of their energy consumption and volume throughput see section 2 1 and 2 2 for an example of such a comparison here we advocate for e v and p as opposed to for example the various other metrics mentioned above because the end product of deionization is most often a volume of treated water which means that volume based performance measures are more directly relevant to practical applications while it may seem that additional performance measures lend further insight in fact many of these metrics are closely related by definition see section 3 5 in the end the total cost of the process is of course the ultimate comparator but cost can vary too much due to a number of application specific factors it is expected though that productivity will have a strong impact on capital cost and energy consumption will have a strong impact on operating cost thus the productivity acts as an approximate surrogate for capital cost and the energy consumption acts as an approximate surrogate for operational cost in addition the choice of e v and p as primary performance measures for a given separation helps facilitate comparisons between cdi and other desalination methods better defining where and how cdi is technologically relevant pan et al 2018 zhao et al 2013a van limpt and van der wal 2014 finally the approach of fig 1 has a direct relevance to thermodynamic efficiency which is another insightful comparator of separation efficiency długołecki and van der wal 2013 wang et al 2018 biesheuvel 2009 hemmatifar et al 2018 thus from here we refer to e v and p as primary performance metrics and the various other molar metrics as secondary performance metrics in addition to e v and p as primary performance measures fig 1 also highlights the other crucial aspect of our performance framework defining the separation conditions the issue with overlooking separation conditions is that virtually any desalination performance metric will be enhanced at lower water recovery and or removal i e lower concentration reduction or absolute amount of moles removed indeed it has been demonstrated that sac asar and enas can all improve when the magnitude of concentration reduction is decreased hawks et al 2018 wang and lin 2018 fig 4 also confirms this effect showing that for higher δ c energy consumption increases and productivity decreases or remains constant in general improving any performance metrics without a set minimum concentration reduction will result in a maximum value at irrelevant vanishingly small concentration reductions furthermore the risk of only examining metrics normalized by salt adsorbed or concentration reduced is that such parameters mask the absolute amount removed concentration reduction is of course not the only important separation condition as cdi performance is expected to decrease with higher water recovery and increase with higher feed salinity due to lower ionic resistances thus cdi performance results at the same concentration reduction and water recovery are not equivalent if taken with different feed concentrations finally there is no straightforward way to convert performance metrics between separation conditions even for simple changes in the separation a quantitative prediction of how performance should scale is difficult requiring a full well calibrated model ramachandran et al 2018b if multiple separation parameters are changed over a wide range then a quantitative comparison of experiment and data is even more difficult biesheuvel et al 2014 to illustrate the need for specifying separation conditions in fig 2 we plot simulated performance curves from the simple resistive model of hawks et al hawks et al 2018 for various concentration reductions δ c fig 2 shows that removal rate as described by asar throughput as described by productivity and energy consumption as described by enas or e v are simultaneously and monotonically enhanced at lower average concentration reduction of the feed stream the input parameters for the model were taken from experimental results from hawks et al hawks et al 2018 and the plot was generated by varying the applied current and flow rate for cc operation with a constant 1 v voltage window the model assumes no faradaic losses but this assumption will not change the overall conclusion that performance typically increases with lower concentration reduction we note that the same general conclusions were recently reached by wang et al wang and lin 2018 with a different cell geometry and device model thus without specifying the concentration reduction for example one is free to exploit the fact that desalinated water is any water that has a salt concentration less than the feed regardless of how much less concentration additionally both fig 2 and fig 4 highlight the inherent trade off between throughput and energy consumption that often emerges reinforcing the assertion that it is critical to report both energy and throughput metrics for a given separation wang and lin 2018 2 1 example separation for cdi research for comparing cdi research results we propose the following separation condition as the nominal case a feed water of 20 mm nacl an average concentration reduction δ c of 5 mm in dynamic steady state dss cycling operation porada et al 2012 zhao et al 2013b hemmatifar et al 2016 and a water recovery of 50 this means that half of the effluent water volume will have an averaged concentration of 15 mm and the other half will have a concentration of 25 mm under these removal conditions we propose reporting at least the two performance parameters mentioned above volumetric energy consumption e v and throughput productivity p for this separation we propose a feed concentration of 20 mm nacl because it is in the middle of the salinity range where cdi is expected to industrially relevant zhao et al 2013a pan et al 2018 van limpt and van der wal 2014 we chose a δ c of 5 mm and a water recovery of 50 because both of these are reasonably attainable in a research lab setting since a standard separation will only be performed if its reporting requirements are reasonably attainable it would be counterproductive to propose removal conditions that are too difficult to meet however too small of a concentration reduction pertains more to salt adsorption characteristics than to desalination performance which makes the suitability of the device for water treatment purposes unclear thus we propose a 5 mm removal as a reasonable compromise between achievability and relevance to desalination higher feed concentrations concentration reductions and recovery ratios would have a greater practical relevance but also require a significantly more refined setup to achieve future work may introduce separation standards that have more practical relevance would increase the concentration reduction and water recovery for example a 15 mm reduction of a 20 mm solution with 75 recovery while even higher feed concentration with 75 concentration reduction and 75 water recovery might be chosen for flow electrode application he et al 2018 moreno and hatzell 2018 rommerskirchen et al 2018 overall though we note that indications of how well a device material or operation mode will fare when taken to larger concentration reductions and water recoveries are already present in the slope of the 5 mm 20 mm 50 removal performance data discussed further in section 2 2 in order to obtain e v and p at wr 50 one can analyze the concentration vs time data with respect to a concentration threshold c thresh below which water is considered to be collected as diluate and above which water is considered to be collected as concentrate fig 3b in fig 3 we show example data for constant flow rate constant current cc operation with a flow through electrode fte cdi device similar to that described in ref 26 see table s2 in the supporting information si for cell particulars not shown as example data but still analyzed for comparison is a flow between membrane cdi fb mcdi device see table s3 in the si for cell particulars the typical choice of threshold concentration if one is used is the feed concentration c thresh c feed however this is arbitrary fig 3b and d illustrate how choosing a different threshold concentration alters the time over which diluate is collected within a dss cycle and subsequently how δ c and w r trade off against each other an example numerical approach for analyzing data like that in fig 3 along with a calculation spreadsheet written in generally available commercial software microsoft excel are provided in the si in terms of measuring e v and p for a given δ c one can extract values at the relevant concentration reduction by sweeping through an operational variable plotting p vs δ c and e v vs δ c and linearly interpolating at the δ c of interest fig 4 curves of this type for the fte cdi cell in fig 4a and b were generated by varying the flow rate 1 5 ml min and holding a constant charging discharging current 0 89 ma cm2 and voltage window 0 2 0 9 v similarly for the fb mcdi device in fig 4c and d such data was generated by varying the magnitude of the charging discharging current 0 74 1 85 ma cm2 and holding a constant flow rate 3 75 ml min per cell discharge voltage 0 v and charging time 3 min the upper charging voltage was not controlled within the voltage window of 0 1 4 v these example experimental sweeps give a range of performance and δ c values see si fig s3 fig s4 and fig 3 for raw data in this way the 5 mm removal condition for instance can be readily estimated from a linear interpolation of the results note that we do not advocate for performance extrapolation and interpolation is most reliable with small data spacing notably the energy consumption data in fig 4 assumes perfect capacitive energy recovery and reuse from the discharge which is an idealized case due to the capacitive nature of cdi a portion of the energy put into the desalination process is recoverable during the discharge however a real circuit that drives cdi devices will not transfer energy perfectly but only recover a fraction η of the total recoverable energy added to the cdi cell during desalination importantly cdi measurements in the lab virtually always measure the total recoverable energy as opposed to actually use it to power further desalination thus in general it is important to note energy consumption values assuming no energy recovery so to know the range of expected values if a real circuit was used for fig 4a and b the 5 mm removal with no energy recovery η 0 consumes 150 wh m3 or about 2 6 times more energy per volume of diluate than with perfect energy recovery and reuse as noted above another benefit of using our proposed separation conditions and metrics is that energy consumption can be readily compared to thermodynamic calculations for instance calculating the specific gibbs free energy of separation as defined in wang et al wang et al 2018 for the 5 mm removal in fig 4b reveals that the thermodynamic minimum e v is 2 8 of the measured value of 58 wh m3 in the same vein the fb mcdi cell in fig 4d has a thermodynamic efficiency of 4 1 as well as a larger productivity for the same separation see si section 3 for full details of calculation and fig s6 and fig s7 for data długołecki and van der wal 2013 hemmatifar et al 2018 this analysis gives context to the energy consumption values in terms of how much more efficient a separation could be if ideally carried out of course even when such efficiencies are compared for equal separations as in fig 4 one must also weigh them against productivity to capture the full performance picture in terms of device comparisons fig 4 provides an example for how to objectively compare different desalination systems e g here cc fte cdi in a b vs cc fb mcdi in c d as expected for identical δ c 5 mm c feed 20 mm w r 50 η 1 separations the mcdi system shows significantly enhanced performance when compared to the membrane free fte cdi system specifically the fb mcdi device consumes 69 of the energy at 138 the productivity when compared to a fte cdi cell importantly such performance gains must be weighted against the additional cost that accompanies the use of membranes in the next section we expand upon fig 4 by further varying operation conditions to achieve multiple performance points p e v at identical δ c 5 mm c feed 20 mm w r 50 η 0 1 separations in this way a more comprehensive picture of performance space can be obtained 2 2 performance tradeoffs for a more complete understanding of performance space one can generate traces like those in fig 4 over several operational variables of interest e g voltage window charging time charging current flow rate etc and then plot e v vs p for identical separations in this vein fig 5 shows experimental results for the fte cdi and fb mcdi devices discussed above fig 5 further reveals the range of performance that can be expected when using control circuits that have perfect energy recovery and reuse η 1 and no energy recovery or reuse η 0 the cc operation data in fig 5 for the fte cdi device was generated by varying the flow rate and charging current and holding the voltage window constant while the data for fb mcdi device was obtained by varying flow rate and charging discharging current and holding the charging time constant the relationship between e v and p for the cc operation observed in fig 5 agrees well with the model predictions of fig 2b all showing a linear tradeoff between throughput and energy consumption over the range explored the difference in slopes between fte cdi and fb mdci is an indicator of how easily the concentration reduction is achieved with the cell operation mode at hand a performance curve with a steeper slope is an indication that the device or operational method will have difficulty achieving higher concentration reductions and will be less suitable for use beyond the examined separation a smaller slope on the other hand indicates an ability to achieve more significant separations and corresponds to a higher charge efficiency and or a lower cell resistance while the curves shown in fig 5 are linear and indeed are expected to be linear based on the simple model presented effects such as parasitic currents or variable charge efficiencies can change the curve shape for realistic systems we therefore recommend that performance is not extrapolated beyond the measured curve with this understanding in mind fig 5 elucidates the difference in performance between cc fte cdi and cc fb mdci indicating that the cc fte cdi system likely cannot increase the concentration reduction significantly beyond 5 mm while the cc fb mdci system could easily achieve larger separations we note though that the performance gains of fb mdci over fte cdi must be weighted against the additional cost that accompanies the use of membranes further the larger difference in energy consumption between η 0 1 for the fte cdi cell vs the fb mcdi cell implies that the fte cdi system is storing a higher amount of the total energy put into the desalination cycle when compared to the fb mcdi cell in terms of quantifying how well one electrode material device or operation mode performs over another one can compare productivity at equivalent energy consumption to assess the relative required system size at a similar operating cost for example in fig 5 with η 1 the fb mcdi device has 3 times more throughput than the fte cdi cell at equivalent energy consumption 56 wh m3 implying that the fte cdi cell must be at least roughly 3 times less expensive than the fb mcdi device to be competitive alternatively one can compare energy consumption at equivalent productivity to estimate the difference in operating cost for a similar system size overall these comparisons highlight how the performance framework introduced herein enables a detail independent assessment of the cdi system s capabilities in terms of its economically relevant deionization performance 3 definitions in this section we mathematically define how to calculate the proposed performance metrics importantly all analyses are intended for cyclic data taken over a full dynamic steady state dss charge discharge cycle porada et al 2012 zhao et al 2013b hemmatifar et al 2016 to supplement these performance values it is also important to publish the raw effluent concentration or conductivity vs time data and the relevant current voltage vs time data for a dss cycle e g fig s3 in the supporting information in our case dss is typically achieved on the third or fourth identical cycle of a given operation condition observing that the effluent conductivity begins and ends at the same value is a simple method for checking that dss has been achieved we also discuss below how these definitions must be modified for systems with flowable electrodes operating continuously rather than cyclically note that here and throughout the paper unit conversions are implied 3 1 water recovery for the water recovery w r fig 1 we define 1 v d δ t d q d t 2 v c δ t c q d t 3 w r v d v d v c where q is the volumetric flow rate through the cell v d is the volume of desalinated water diluate collected that when mixed has a lower salinity relative to the feed stream v c is the volume of brine water concentrate collected that when mixed is enriched in salt relative to the feed stream δ t d is the time over which the desalinated water is collected δ t c is the time over which the concentrate stream is collected and w r is the water recovery the typical choice of δ t d is everywhere where the effluent conductivity is less than the feed conductivity fig 3b however the user is in fact free to choose the region δ t d over a dss cycle arbitrarily so long as final average salinity is lower than the feed in our definition the total volume of fluid flowed over the dss cycle is v d v c 3 2 concentration reduction the salt removed from the effluent stream and the average concentration reduction can be calculated from 4 δ n d δ t d q c feed c o u t d t 5 δ n c δ t c q c feed c o u t d t 6 δ c δ n d v d where δ n d is the salt removed over one cycle relative to the feed stream as measured from the effluent moles δ n c is the salt added to the concentrate stream over one cycle as measured by the effluent moles c o u t is the effluent salt concentration mm and δ c is the average concentration reduction mm δ n d is maximum for the choice of δ t d such that c thresh c feed and will go down if a smaller portion of more strongly desalinated water is kept to enhance concentration reduction or if a portion of the concentrate is used to enhance water recovery fig 3d 3 3 energy consumption for volumetric energy consumption per cell e v of fig 1 we propose 7 e i n δ t c y c l e i v d t where i v 0 8 e o u t δ t c y c l e i v d t where i v 0 9 e v e i n η e o u t v d 10 e m e i n η e o u t δ n d where i v is the current voltage product for a single electrode pair w δ t c y c l e is the total dss cycle time min e i n is the total energy input during the dss cycle j e o u t is the total recoverable energy from the cell over the dss cycle j e v is the volumetric energy consumption wh m3 e m the molar energy consumption kj mol and η is the fraction of e o u t actually recovered and reused to power another charging phase thus if perfect energy recovery is assumed as in fig 4 then implicitly η 1 examples of practical values of η 0 25 0 5 can be found in the literature landon et al 2013 kang et al 2016 pernia et al 2014 pernía et al 2012 since real world energy transfer circuits e g buck boost converters are not perfectly efficient it is important to report e v for at least two values of η e g 0 and 1 if there are multiple devices in series or parallel then e i n η e o u t and v d in eqn 9 must be summed appropriately a graphical example of e i n e o u t and δ t c y c l e for the cell examined herein is shown in fig 3a if the pumping energy is significant compared to the desalination energy e v then this number is important to report as well the pumping energy for a cdi cycle can be calculated as e p p q d t v d wh m3 where p is the pressure drop across the cell and the integral is over a cycle for the data in fig 4a and b the pumping energy is at worst 4 times lower than the desalination energy 5 wh m3 making it safe to assume that it is negligible 3 4 productivity for throughput we use the term productivity fig 1 pan et al 2017 which is given by 11 p v d n a δ t c y c l e where p is the productivity in l h m2 n is the number of cells electrode pairs in the cdi stack series and parallel and a is the projected face area cm2 of one cell as discussed above and illustrated in fig s2 in the si the productivity is simply a volume of diluate produced per unit time per projected face area of device since the separation condition i e δ c w r and c feed is already specified there is only a need to specify volume throughput and not an average removal rate like with asar normalizing by projected face area rather than electrode mass is more directly related to cell resistance and cost especially when membranes are used similarly volume throughput for a given separation is more closely tied to general desalination performance as opposed to salt removal rate ghaffour et al 2013 zhao et al 2013a which is more specific to cdi type desalination techniques 3 5 performance metric relationships finally it is important to understand the defined relationships between traditional performance metrics what we call here secondary performance metrics and those detailed above for instance recalling that the previous performance metrics asar and enas as defined in ref 26 are 12 a s a r δ n d n a δ t c y c l e 13 e n a s δ n d e i n η e o u t then comparing eqns 12 and 13 to eqns 6 and 9 11 reveals that 14 p a s a r δ c 15 e v δ c e n a s 16 e m e v δ c furthermore combining eqns 14 and 15 gives 17 p e v a s a r e n a s thus with δ c specified the volumetric metrics proposed here can be converted to the traditional molar parameters and vice versa note that here and throughout the paper unit conversions are implied the exercise of examining how various performance metrics in the cdi literature are related by definition is important because it reveals where metric comparisons do not necessarily give additional insight only relations by definition ultimately we chose to advocate for the two parameters e v and p because they reflect generally desirable desalination characteristics for any system regardless of its operating mechanism we do not advocate using molar based metrics because the end product of deionization is a volume of treated water not a mole of salt which makes volume normalized quantities of a more broad interest interestingly though enas by definition is e n a s δ c e v which gives a sense of how efficiently a given δ c is achieved however this number must be analyzed extremely carefully because the best values can often occur in a region of separation space that is irrelevant to practical applications i e low δ c thus various normalized analysis of desalination performance that deviates from fig 1 framework must be conducted with caution 3 6 non dss operation while dss cycling is the dominant mode of operation for cdi there are other operation modes like batch mode and flow electrode setups that require a different approach to calculating the various parameters described above in general though the approach depicted in fig 1 holds regardless of operation method for systems with flowable electrodes doornbusch et al 2016 the definitions eqns 1 11 still hold by replacing the specified integration time with the total experiment time for batch mode operation porada et al 2013b the individual quantities e i n η e o u t are obtained from integrated electrical power over the experiment time the relevant experiment time of fig 1 in batch mode is taken as both the time to desalinate and the time to regenerate the electrodes and fill the waste tank the final volumes eqs 1 and 2 and concentrations in batch mode are easily measured from the final state of the waste tank and treated tank 4 performance indicators in this section we will discuss parameters which we believe are highly useful for understanding cell performance and material limitations but are not performance metrics in and of themselves these parameters combined with the reported operational performance metrics above can help better understand why certain materials device architectures and operation modes are more suitable for cdi or in contrast are less suitable if the primary goal of the study is to evaluate a novel electrode material then such extra characterization is especially critical importantly the following descriptions are not meant to be comprehensive technical reviews but rather are included to lend context to the cdi performance metric indicator landscape 4 1 salt adsorption capacity we begin our performance indicator discussion with the salt adsorption capacity mg g which for a cdi cell over a dss cycle is given by 18 s a c m m δ n d where m is the molar mass of the salt g mol m is the total mass of electrodes in the cell g the sac is a function of operational flow efficiency defined below and in ref 26 and magnitude of adsorbed salt over a dss cycle hawks et al 2018 this is in contrast to the maximum salt adsorption capacity msac or identically equilibrium salt adsorption capacity eq sac which are taken at constant voltage equilibrium the eq sac value is best measured over many charging voltages to at least v 1 2 v with the discharge voltage typically set to zero a salinity of 20 mm and using nacl so that experiments can be compared between different studies guyes et al 2017 suss et al 2015 notably if the electrode material density is reported ρ e then different eq sac normalizations e g mg ml or mg g can be readily evaluated the strength of eq sac is that it is an indicator of the upper limit of desalination capacity over a given voltage window where higher values typically correspond to larger obtainable removals during operation i e higher possible concentration reductions and water recoveries however eq sac is not a desalination performance metric in and of itself and therefore cannot be used as a substitute for energy consumption and throughput eq sac is influenced by a combination parameters including equilibrium charge efficiency charging and discharging voltages point of zero charge pzc and material capacitance 4 2 capacitance and pzc the capacitance and pzc are important factors that underly sac and therefore also strongly impact the desalination capacity of a cell a discussion of capacitance characterization for electrochemical supercapacitors is given by zuliani et al zuliani et al 2015 and analysis of the material point of zero charge pzc and its influence on cdi performance can be found in avraham et al 2011 hemmatifar et al 2017 omosebi et al 2014 2015 in brief though the cell s differential capacitance can be evaluated through the use of the equation 19 c i d v d t 1 where v is the cell voltage v i is the current a and c is the capacitance f which can be converted to material capacitance f g or f cm3 by considering the electrodes in a cdi cell as two capacitors in series zuliani et al 2015 in terms of normalization zuliani et al 2015 gogotsi and simon 2011 the electrode volumetric capacitance in f cm3 is more relevant to cdi operation hawks et al 2018 but the gravimetric capacitance in f g has better comparability to electrochemical capacitors at large thus assessing both is important similar to sac if the electrode material density is reported then the volumetric and gravimetric capacitance values can be calculated from one another eqn 19 suffices for capacitance assessment of both supercapacitors and pseudocapacitors brousse et al 2015 however it may not be the best way to characterize intercalation storage mechanisms which are an emerging area of interest in cdi porada et al 2017 kim et al 2017 suss and presser 2018 in the case of charge storage by intercalation electrode capacity in mah cm3 and mah g and voltage window are perhaps more appropriate in contrast to energy storage studies the relevant material capacitance can be difficult to evaluate due to the low electrolyte concentrations pertinent to cdi operation e g 20 mm nacl at these low concentrations significant pzc depletion resistive and faradaic effects can obscure the capacitance evaluation by eqn 19 we find that in cc operation for example the discharge portion of the desalination cycle can often provide a somewhat reasonable estimation of c through eqn 19 this analysis is identical to evaluating the capacitance by the method of galvanostatic cycling which is a common approach for capacitance evaluation zuliani et al 2015 another way to measure capacitance is with cyclic voltammetry cv taken at concentrations and multiple sweep rates d v d t that are comparable to the ones used for desalination for such a cv measurement the electrode material pzc can be estimated from the voltage at which the capacitance from eqn 19 passes through a local minimum for purely comparative purposes the differential capacitance can be taken as the value of c at v 0 c v 0 see si fig s9 an illustration of these effects and cv analysis are presented in the si fig s9 including for the cell from figs 3 and 4 fig s1 if the cv is measured in a cdi cell then it can be done with sufficient flow rate such that depletion effects are avoided it is important that the cv is measured both over enough cycles such that dss is reached and at relevant concentrations since double layer capacitance scales non linearly with electrolyte concentration in the low ionic strength regime that is relevant to cdi other ways to measure the capacitance are by the galvanometric intermittent titration technique gitt or amperometric intermittent titration technique aitt which involve transferring a precise quantity of charge and measuring the change in voltage or changing the cell voltage and measuring the charge transferred respectively these methods have been routinely applied in cdi for carbon based materials zhao et al 2010 porada et al 2012 2013b a as well as recently applied for cdi with intercalation materials porada et al 2017 compared to cv gitt may be more applicable to intercalation materials porada et al 2017 and aitt might be more practical at low salinities e g 5 mm nacl porada et al 2012 guyes et al 2017 kim et al 2015 4 3 charge and coulombic efficiencies a further set of relevant performance indicators are the charge efficiency and coulombic efficiency which have been the subject of much research in cdi shanbhag et al 2016 zhao et al 2012 2010 avraham et al 2009 2010 gao et al 2014 kim et al 2015 hemmatifar et al 2016 in terms of dss cycling the charge transferred total cycle charge efficiency λ c y c l e and round trip coulombic efficiency η c o u l smith et al 2014 shanbhag et al 2016 are defined here by 20 q i n δ t c y c l e i d t where i 0 21 q o u t δ t c y c l e i d t where i 0 22 λ c y c l e f δ n d q i n 23 η c o u l q o u t q i n where q i n is the charge transferred at positive current c q o u t is the charge transferred at negative current c and f is faraday s constant 96485 c mol of the two periods of opposing current direction in eqns 19 and 20 we define positive current to be the charging step which is that period where the energy input was higher than in the period of opposing current sign alternatively if the voltage polarity does not change and one assumes charge conservation over a dss cycle then the charge transferred to the cell must not be greater than the charge released from the cell or q o u t q i n from this the definition of positive current in eqn 19 also follows a graphical example of q i n and q o u t for the cell examined herein is shown in fig 3c it should also be noted that there is some ambiguity in the literature regarding the use of q i n or q o u t in eqn 22 for instance λ c y c l e as defined here was referred to as the dynamic charge efficiency in refs 26 and 72 but in ref 71 the charge efficiency was taken as λ c y c l e η c o u l f δ n d q o u t the replacement of q i n with q o u t in eqn 22 can be done to partly factor out coulombic losses in the total cycle charge efficiency while the true capacitive charge transferred over a cycle lies somewhere between q i n and q o u t using the charge released is a reasonable approach as the capacitive charge transferred is generally expected to be closer to q o u t in general these efficiencies reflect the disparity between transferred electrical charge on one hand and salt deficiency or excess in the effluent stream on the other in typical unfunctionalized carbon based electrodes there are broadly three main reasons behind such disparities first at low potentials across the electric double layers co ion expulsion occurs to a significant extent compared to counterion adsorption leading to inefficient net adsorption second unwanted parasitic reactions can consume accumulated electric charge via faradaic reactions at one or more electrodes and finally a portion of the desalinated water inside the cell is often not recoverable due to operational effects hawks et al 2018 shang et al 2017 such effects are captured by the flow efficiency parameter hawks et al 2018 johnson and newman 1971 which is defined as the ratio of moles of salt removed from the effluent stream to the moles of salt adsorbed by the electrodes over a dss cycle hawks et al 2018 overall the total cycle charge efficiency is influenced by flow efficiency double layer and faradaic effects hawks et al 2018 and the round trip coulombic efficiency η c o u l of eqn 23 measures charge loss due to faradaic processes bazant 2013 pillay and newman 1996 taken together a full analysis of eqns 22 and 23 can yield significant insight as to where operational performance losses are being incurred 4 4 series resistance finally the series resistance is an important parameter that can help understand performance qu et al 2015 2016 dykstra et al 2016 energy loss in cdi occurs via primarily two processes energy dissipation through joule heating by current through the resistive elements in the system and unwanted faradaic reactions the resistive elements can be categorized as a series resistance and an ionic resistance within the electrode pores this series resistance includes external leads contact resistances at current collectors collector resistance often negligible and ionic resistance within the separator the impedance across the electrode thickness can be thought of as a distributed series parallel arrangement of ionic resistances capacitive surfaces and electronic resistance of the electrode material i e a transmission line posey and morozumi 1966 dunn and newman 2000 de levie 1964 while the series resistance clearly affects energy consumption qu et al 2016 hemmatifar et al 2016 it also influences operational performance through for example the r c charging time in cv operation and voltage window in cc operation here we define the total series resistance r s as the external electronic resistance r e e r plus the separator resistance r s p i e r s r e e r r s p dykstra et al 2016 in other words the series resistance is the resistance of every part of the system except the resistance of the electrolyte in the porous electrodes the external electronic resistance r e e r includes the resistance due to the current collector wires and contacts qu et al 2015 dykstra et al 2016 whereas the separator resistance r s p captures the ionic resistance across the separator according to 24 r s p l s p τ s p a κ p s p where l s p is the separator thickness μm τ s p is the separator tortuosity κ is the electrolyte conductivity in the separator ms cm and p s p is the separator porosity there is also a significant ionic transport resistance associated with the electrolyte in the macropores however this resistance is strongly frequency dependent being an electrical short at high frequency that ideally transitions to a capacitance in series with the electrolyte resistance at low frequency suss et al 2013 posey and morozumi 1966 dunn and newman 2000 de levie 1964 in terms of experiments the series resistance in particular can be readily measured with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis at high frequency e g 10 100 khz by taking the value of the real part of the impedance as the imaginary part tends to zero see si figs s10 and s11 it is important to note that high frequency eis measurements are capable of measuring the true r s whereas methods based on applying an abrupt current or voltage step and measuring the instantaneous response often captures a significant amount of electrode ionic resistance unless high time resolution equipment is used because eqn 24 is dependent on ion concentration r s will change dynamically throughout a cdi cycle due to changes in electrolyte conductivity from desalination and regeneration hemmatifar et al 2016 nevertheless eis measurements are useful for establishing a baseline for comparing different device architectures and better understanding differences in performance examples and illustrations of how to measure r s with eis are presented in section 6 of the si 5 parameter summary a summary of the essential separation conditions performance metrics and performance indicators that are discussed above are presented in table 1 in the si a table is given defining all parameters used in this work including those in table 1 we also add to tables s2 and s3 several essential cell characteristics that are highly valuable in interpreting desalination results for example the dry electrode material density is a critical electrode property that allows for conversion between gravimetric and volumetric parameters additionally the number of membranes used per cell is important for estimating the overall device cost as the membranes are typically a cost driving factor for the devices that use them finally general device geometric parameters like the electrode and separator thickness dry uncompressed are important basic cell characteristics that influence the magnitude of many of the discussed parameters the parameters in table 1 for the cell that underlies the results in fig 4 along with other important cell characteristics are summarized in a separation report in the si table s2 for convenience we also provide this report format in the form of a calculation spreadsheet written in generally available commercial software microsoft excel that can be downloaded and readily used for other studies 6 conclusions in summary we proposed a framework for quantifying cdi performance in terms of volumetric energy consumption wh m3 and throughput productivity l h m2 we demonstrated that reporting these metrics for equivalent separation conditions is essential for comparability and obtaining practically meaningful values for research purposes we proposed a nominal standard removal of 5 mm out of a 20 mm nacl feed stream at 50 water recovery for comparing new materials devices and operation modes using this separation we compare performance between a fte cdi cell and fb mcdi cell showing how significantly different systems can be compared in terms of generic desalination performance the need for introducing such a framework arises from previously used metrics being reported without specifying the removal conditions concentration reduction feed concentration and water recovery in general metric normalization must be carefully considered so to not allow evaluation at unspecified removal the rationale presented here resolves this issue and better aligns cdi performance reporting with the field of desalination in general finally for context we discuss various cell characteristics and performance indicators that are highly useful for understanding why certain performance metrics were measured taken together this work helps drive cdi in a direction towards more comparable and relevant performance evaluations so that this technology

19028,in the growing field of capacitive deionization cdi a number of performance metrics have emerged to describe the desalination process unfortunately the separation conditions under which these metrics are measured are often not specified resulting in optimal performance at minimal removal here we outline a system of performance metrics and reporting conditions that resolves this issue our proposed system is based on volumetric energy consumption wh m3 and throughput productivity l h m2 reported for a specific average concentration reduction water recovery and feed salinity to facilitate and rationalize comparisons between devices materials and operation modes we propose a nominal standard separation of removing 5 mm from a 20 mm nacl feed solution at 50 water recovery we propose this particular separation as a standard but emphasize that the rationale presented here applies irrespective of separation details using our proposed separation we compare the desalination performance of a flow through electrode fte cdi cell and a flow between membrane fb mcdi device showing how significantly different systems can be compared in terms of generally desirable desalination characteristics in general we find that performance analysis must be considered carefully so to not allow for ambiguous separation conditions or the maximization of one metric at the expense of another additionally for context and clarity we discuss a number of important underlying performance indicators and cell characteristics that are not performance measures in and of themselves but can be examined to better understand differences in performance graphical abstract image 1 keywords capacitive desalination capacitive deionization cdi performance 1 introduction capacitive deionization cdi encompasses a group of water desalination technologies that uses cyclic charging and discharging of electrodes and the resulting electrosorption of ions to deplete or enrich a feed water stream biesheuvel et al 2017 interest in cdi has grown substantially in recent years with currently more than 150 publications annually reporting on the topic zhang et al 2018 as often occurs in a growing device research field a need has emerged for establishing guidelines for evaluating reporting and comparing device performance balducci et al 2017 khenkin et al 2018 gogotsi and simon 2011 brousse et al 2015 editorial 2015 zuliani et al 2015 at present much of the work in cdi focuses on materials and methods to improve the efficiency and desalination capacity of the system but many published studies are actually not comparable to one another this is primarily because either certain critical performance parameters are not reported or the desalination conditions explored are different in some substantial aspect for desalination technologies such as reverse osmosis ro or electrodialysis ed performance metrics typically include energy consumption per volume of dilute effluent and a volume throughput parameter cohen tanugi et al 2014 park et al 2017 alvarado and chen 2014 pan et al 2017 this set of metrics is sufficient for comparison between removal methods only when the water recovery wr feed salinity and total concentration reduction are the same park et al 2017 in other words energy and throughput metrics alone are insufficient to provide a comparable description of performance because these values depend critically on the separation conditions achieving comparable separation conditions in cdi is particularly difficult because the method usually removes a smaller highly variable fraction of the ions since extrapolating results from one set of removal conditions to another is not straightforward it is critical to control for the feed salinity concentration reduction and water recovery in a performance evaluation to add to the complexity of the cdi performance landscape the community has turned to a number of metrics to describe its desalination process some commonly used energy throughput and materials metrics in cdi are the salt adsorption capacity sac in mg g of electrodes average salt adsorption rate asar in mol min cm2 or in mg g min zhao et al 2013b kim and yoon 2015 hemmatifar et al 2016 hawks et al 2018 wang and lin 2018 energy consumption per mole of salt removed in kj mol kj g or k t ion zhao et al 2012 qu et al 2016 suss et al 2015 shang et al 2017 energy normalized adsorbed salt enas in μmol j hemmatifar et al 2016 hawks et al 2018 oyarzun et al 2018 and specific energy consumption sec 1 in mg j wang and lin 2018 while these metrics may be insightful for the processes relevant to cdi it would be beneficial to settle upon a minimum necessary set of measures that reflect economically relevant desalination performance additionally it is important to distinguish between throughput and energy consumption as these different desalination aspects often trade off with one another indeed several studies have shown that sac asar and enas for example are highly coupled with clear tradeoffs among them hemmatifar et al 2016 kim and yoon 2015 hawks et al 2018 wang and lin 2018 for instance adsorption rate can be increased at the cost of higher energy consumption or lower sac hemmatifar et al 2016 kim and yoon 2015 thus both an energy and a throughput metric must be reported for a given separation in order to fully define performance with these considerations in mind herein we present a framework for objectively comparing desalination performance in capacitive based removal systems along with an example standardized deionization protocol for cdi research we also discuss the relation between the proposed parameters and their typically used traditional counterparts our goal here is to create a framework by which generic economically relevant desalination capability can be evaluated for a given separation with any cdi type approach to highlight how this framework can be implemented we propose a standard protocol that can be reasonably followed for both large and small laboratory scale devices with the intent of facilitating study to study comparisons in cdi research hence for example our procedure does not prescribe flow rates charging methods device size electrode configuration or even removal mechanism for context we also distinguish between performance metrics and performance indicators where metrics are meant to reflect generic desalination performance and indicators are used to better understand why a certain performance was achieved since understanding the reasons behind differences in performance is vitally important to technological progress we discuss a number of performance indicators and highlight the essential cell characteristics that underlie many of these results 2 framework for comparing deionization performance our proposed approach to evaluating desalination performance of a cdi system is pictographically shown in fig 1 first and most importantly a target separation must be defined which includes the feed salt concentration c feed the concentration reduction after treatment δ c and the water recovery w r with these conditions defined the desalination performance can be evaluated by examining the energy consumed per cubic meter of diluate e v in wh m3 and the throughput productivity p in l h m2 where the area unit in p corresponds to the projected face area of a typical device i e the face area over which electrodes overlap see fig s2 in the supporting information or projected face area of the membranes in a flow electrode cell cohen tanugi et al 2014 pan et al 2017 doornbusch et al 2016 these performance metrics are defined quantitatively below for dynamic steady state dss cycling but pertain to any operation mode e g batch flow electrode etc by controlling for the separation conditions new materials huang et al 2017 device geometries suss et al 2015 electrode configurations mubita et al 2018 qu et al 2018 and operation modes qu et al 2016 dykstra et al 2018 garcía quismondo et al 2016 ramachandran et al 2018a can be objectively compared to one and other in terms of their energy consumption and volume throughput see section 2 1 and 2 2 for an example of such a comparison here we advocate for e v and p as opposed to for example the various other metrics mentioned above because the end product of deionization is most often a volume of treated water which means that volume based performance measures are more directly relevant to practical applications while it may seem that additional performance measures lend further insight in fact many of these metrics are closely related by definition see section 3 5 in the end the total cost of the process is of course the ultimate comparator but cost can vary too much due to a number of application specific factors it is expected though that productivity will have a strong impact on capital cost and energy consumption will have a strong impact on operating cost thus the productivity acts as an approximate surrogate for capital cost and the energy consumption acts as an approximate surrogate for operational cost in addition the choice of e v and p as primary performance measures for a given separation helps facilitate comparisons between cdi and other desalination methods better defining where and how cdi is technologically relevant pan et al 2018 zhao et al 2013a van limpt and van der wal 2014 finally the approach of fig 1 has a direct relevance to thermodynamic efficiency which is another insightful comparator of separation efficiency długołecki and van der wal 2013 wang et al 2018 biesheuvel 2009 hemmatifar et al 2018 thus from here we refer to e v and p as primary performance metrics and the various other molar metrics as secondary performance metrics in addition to e v and p as primary performance measures fig 1 also highlights the other crucial aspect of our performance framework defining the separation conditions the issue with overlooking separation conditions is that virtually any desalination performance metric will be enhanced at lower water recovery and or removal i e lower concentration reduction or absolute amount of moles removed indeed it has been demonstrated that sac asar and enas can all improve when the magnitude of concentration reduction is decreased hawks et al 2018 wang and lin 2018 fig 4 also confirms this effect showing that for higher δ c energy consumption increases and productivity decreases or remains constant in general improving any performance metrics without a set minimum concentration reduction will result in a maximum value at irrelevant vanishingly small concentration reductions furthermore the risk of only examining metrics normalized by salt adsorbed or concentration reduced is that such parameters mask the absolute amount removed concentration reduction is of course not the only important separation condition as cdi performance is expected to decrease with higher water recovery and increase with higher feed salinity due to lower ionic resistances thus cdi performance results at the same concentration reduction and water recovery are not equivalent if taken with different feed concentrations finally there is no straightforward way to convert performance metrics between separation conditions even for simple changes in the separation a quantitative prediction of how performance should scale is difficult requiring a full well calibrated model ramachandran et al 2018b if multiple separation parameters are changed over a wide range then a quantitative comparison of experiment and data is even more difficult biesheuvel et al 2014 to illustrate the need for specifying separation conditions in fig 2 we plot simulated performance curves from the simple resistive model of hawks et al hawks et al 2018 for various concentration reductions δ c fig 2 shows that removal rate as described by asar throughput as described by productivity and energy consumption as described by enas or e v are simultaneously and monotonically enhanced at lower average concentration reduction of the feed stream the input parameters for the model were taken from experimental results from hawks et al hawks et al 2018 and the plot was generated by varying the applied current and flow rate for cc operation with a constant 1 v voltage window the model assumes no faradaic losses but this assumption will not change the overall conclusion that performance typically increases with lower concentration reduction we note that the same general conclusions were recently reached by wang et al wang and lin 2018 with a different cell geometry and device model thus without specifying the concentration reduction for example one is free to exploit the fact that desalinated water is any water that has a salt concentration less than the feed regardless of how much less concentration additionally both fig 2 and fig 4 highlight the inherent trade off between throughput and energy consumption that often emerges reinforcing the assertion that it is critical to report both energy and throughput metrics for a given separation wang and lin 2018 2 1 example separation for cdi research for comparing cdi research results we propose the following separation condition as the nominal case a feed water of 20 mm nacl an average concentration reduction δ c of 5 mm in dynamic steady state dss cycling operation porada et al 2012 zhao et al 2013b hemmatifar et al 2016 and a water recovery of 50 this means that half of the effluent water volume will have an averaged concentration of 15 mm and the other half will have a concentration of 25 mm under these removal conditions we propose reporting at least the two performance parameters mentioned above volumetric energy consumption e v and throughput productivity p for this separation we propose a feed concentration of 20 mm nacl because it is in the middle of the salinity range where cdi is expected to industrially relevant zhao et al 2013a pan et al 2018 van limpt and van der wal 2014 we chose a δ c of 5 mm and a water recovery of 50 because both of these are reasonably attainable in a research lab setting since a standard separation will only be performed if its reporting requirements are reasonably attainable it would be counterproductive to propose removal conditions that are too difficult to meet however too small of a concentration reduction pertains more to salt adsorption characteristics than to desalination performance which makes the suitability of the device for water treatment purposes unclear thus we propose a 5 mm removal as a reasonable compromise between achievability and relevance to desalination higher feed concentrations concentration reductions and recovery ratios would have a greater practical relevance but also require a significantly more refined setup to achieve future work may introduce separation standards that have more practical relevance would increase the concentration reduction and water recovery for example a 15 mm reduction of a 20 mm solution with 75 recovery while even higher feed concentration with 75 concentration reduction and 75 water recovery might be chosen for flow electrode application he et al 2018 moreno and hatzell 2018 rommerskirchen et al 2018 overall though we note that indications of how well a device material or operation mode will fare when taken to larger concentration reductions and water recoveries are already present in the slope of the 5 mm 20 mm 50 removal performance data discussed further in section 2 2 in order to obtain e v and p at wr 50 one can analyze the concentration vs time data with respect to a concentration threshold c thresh below which water is considered to be collected as diluate and above which water is considered to be collected as concentrate fig 3b in fig 3 we show example data for constant flow rate constant current cc operation with a flow through electrode fte cdi device similar to that described in ref 26 see table s2 in the supporting information si for cell particulars not shown as example data but still analyzed for comparison is a flow between membrane cdi fb mcdi device see table s3 in the si for cell particulars the typical choice of threshold concentration if one is used is the feed concentration c thresh c feed however this is arbitrary fig 3b and d illustrate how choosing a different threshold concentration alters the time over which diluate is collected within a dss cycle and subsequently how δ c and w r trade off against each other an example numerical approach for analyzing data like that in fig 3 along with a calculation spreadsheet written in generally available commercial software microsoft excel are provided in the si in terms of measuring e v and p for a given δ c one can extract values at the relevant concentration reduction by sweeping through an operational variable plotting p vs δ c and e v vs δ c and linearly interpolating at the δ c of interest fig 4 curves of this type for the fte cdi cell in fig 4a and b were generated by varying the flow rate 1 5 ml min and holding a constant charging discharging current 0 89 ma cm2 and voltage window 0 2 0 9 v similarly for the fb mcdi device in fig 4c and d such data was generated by varying the magnitude of the charging discharging current 0 74 1 85 ma cm2 and holding a constant flow rate 3 75 ml min per cell discharge voltage 0 v and charging time 3 min the upper charging voltage was not controlled within the voltage window of 0 1 4 v these example experimental sweeps give a range of performance and δ c values see si fig s3 fig s4 and fig 3 for raw data in this way the 5 mm removal condition for instance can be readily estimated from a linear interpolation of the results note that we do not advocate for performance extrapolation and interpolation is most reliable with small data spacing notably the energy consumption data in fig 4 assumes perfect capacitive energy recovery and reuse from the discharge which is an idealized case due to the capacitive nature of cdi a portion of the energy put into the desalination process is recoverable during the discharge however a real circuit that drives cdi devices will not transfer energy perfectly but only recover a fraction η of the total recoverable energy added to the cdi cell during desalination importantly cdi measurements in the lab virtually always measure the total recoverable energy as opposed to actually use it to power further desalination thus in general it is important to note energy consumption values assuming no energy recovery so to know the range of expected values if a real circuit was used for fig 4a and b the 5 mm removal with no energy recovery η 0 consumes 150 wh m3 or about 2 6 times more energy per volume of diluate than with perfect energy recovery and reuse as noted above another benefit of using our proposed separation conditions and metrics is that energy consumption can be readily compared to thermodynamic calculations for instance calculating the specific gibbs free energy of separation as defined in wang et al wang et al 2018 for the 5 mm removal in fig 4b reveals that the thermodynamic minimum e v is 2 8 of the measured value of 58 wh m3 in the same vein the fb mcdi cell in fig 4d has a thermodynamic efficiency of 4 1 as well as a larger productivity for the same separation see si section 3 for full details of calculation and fig s6 and fig s7 for data długołecki and van der wal 2013 hemmatifar et al 2018 this analysis gives context to the energy consumption values in terms of how much more efficient a separation could be if ideally carried out of course even when such efficiencies are compared for equal separations as in fig 4 one must also weigh them against productivity to capture the full performance picture in terms of device comparisons fig 4 provides an example for how to objectively compare different desalination systems e g here cc fte cdi in a b vs cc fb mcdi in c d as expected for identical δ c 5 mm c feed 20 mm w r 50 η 1 separations the mcdi system shows significantly enhanced performance when compared to the membrane free fte cdi system specifically the fb mcdi device consumes 69 of the energy at 138 the productivity when compared to a fte cdi cell importantly such performance gains must be weighted against the additional cost that accompanies the use of membranes in the next section we expand upon fig 4 by further varying operation conditions to achieve multiple performance points p e v at identical δ c 5 mm c feed 20 mm w r 50 η 0 1 separations in this way a more comprehensive picture of performance space can be obtained 2 2 performance tradeoffs for a more complete understanding of performance space one can generate traces like those in fig 4 over several operational variables of interest e g voltage window charging time charging current flow rate etc and then plot e v vs p for identical separations in this vein fig 5 shows experimental results for the fte cdi and fb mcdi devices discussed above fig 5 further reveals the range of performance that can be expected when using control circuits that have perfect energy recovery and reuse η 1 and no energy recovery or reuse η 0 the cc operation data in fig 5 for the fte cdi device was generated by varying the flow rate and charging current and holding the voltage window constant while the data for fb mcdi device was obtained by varying flow rate and charging discharging current and holding the charging time constant the relationship between e v and p for the cc operation observed in fig 5 agrees well with the model predictions of fig 2b all showing a linear tradeoff between throughput and energy consumption over the range explored the difference in slopes between fte cdi and fb mdci is an indicator of how easily the concentration reduction is achieved with the cell operation mode at hand a performance curve with a steeper slope is an indication that the device or operational method will have difficulty achieving higher concentration reductions and will be less suitable for use beyond the examined separation a smaller slope on the other hand indicates an ability to achieve more significant separations and corresponds to a higher charge efficiency and or a lower cell resistance while the curves shown in fig 5 are linear and indeed are expected to be linear based on the simple model presented effects such as parasitic currents or variable charge efficiencies can change the curve shape for realistic systems we therefore recommend that performance is not extrapolated beyond the measured curve with this understanding in mind fig 5 elucidates the difference in performance between cc fte cdi and cc fb mdci indicating that the cc fte cdi system likely cannot increase the concentration reduction significantly beyond 5 mm while the cc fb mdci system could easily achieve larger separations we note though that the performance gains of fb mdci over fte cdi must be weighted against the additional cost that accompanies the use of membranes further the larger difference in energy consumption between η 0 1 for the fte cdi cell vs the fb mcdi cell implies that the fte cdi system is storing a higher amount of the total energy put into the desalination cycle when compared to the fb mcdi cell in terms of quantifying how well one electrode material device or operation mode performs over another one can compare productivity at equivalent energy consumption to assess the relative required system size at a similar operating cost for example in fig 5 with η 1 the fb mcdi device has 3 times more throughput than the fte cdi cell at equivalent energy consumption 56 wh m3 implying that the fte cdi cell must be at least roughly 3 times less expensive than the fb mcdi device to be competitive alternatively one can compare energy consumption at equivalent productivity to estimate the difference in operating cost for a similar system size overall these comparisons highlight how the performance framework introduced herein enables a detail independent assessment of the cdi system s capabilities in terms of its economically relevant deionization performance 3 definitions in this section we mathematically define how to calculate the proposed performance metrics importantly all analyses are intended for cyclic data taken over a full dynamic steady state dss charge discharge cycle porada et al 2012 zhao et al 2013b hemmatifar et al 2016 to supplement these performance values it is also important to publish the raw effluent concentration or conductivity vs time data and the relevant current voltage vs time data for a dss cycle e g fig s3 in the supporting information in our case dss is typically achieved on the third or fourth identical cycle of a given operation condition observing that the effluent conductivity begins and ends at the same value is a simple method for checking that dss has been achieved we also discuss below how these definitions must be modified for systems with flowable electrodes operating continuously rather than cyclically note that here and throughout the paper unit conversions are implied 3 1 water recovery for the water recovery w r fig 1 we define 1 v d δ t d q d t 2 v c δ t c q d t 3 w r v d v d v c where q is the volumetric flow rate through the cell v d is the volume of desalinated water diluate collected that when mixed has a lower salinity relative to the feed stream v c is the volume of brine water concentrate collected that when mixed is enriched in salt relative to the feed stream δ t d is the time over which the desalinated water is collected δ t c is the time over which the concentrate stream is collected and w r is the water recovery the typical choice of δ t d is everywhere where the effluent conductivity is less than the feed conductivity fig 3b however the user is in fact free to choose the region δ t d over a dss cycle arbitrarily so long as final average salinity is lower than the feed in our definition the total volume of fluid flowed over the dss cycle is v d v c 3 2 concentration reduction the salt removed from the effluent stream and the average concentration reduction can be calculated from 4 δ n d δ t d q c feed c o u t d t 5 δ n c δ t c q c feed c o u t d t 6 δ c δ n d v d where δ n d is the salt removed over one cycle relative to the feed stream as measured from the effluent moles δ n c is the salt added to the concentrate stream over one cycle as measured by the effluent moles c o u t is the effluent salt concentration mm and δ c is the average concentration reduction mm δ n d is maximum for the choice of δ t d such that c thresh c feed and will go down if a smaller portion of more strongly desalinated water is kept to enhance concentration reduction or if a portion of the concentrate is used to enhance water recovery fig 3d 3 3 energy consumption for volumetric energy consumption per cell e v of fig 1 we propose 7 e i n δ t c y c l e i v d t where i

dss cycle time min e i n is the total energy input during the dss cycle j e o u t is the total recoverable energy from the cell over the dss cycle j e v is the volumetric energy consumption wh m3 e m the molar energy consumption kj mol and η is the fraction of e o u t actually recovered and reused to power another charging phase thus if perfect energy recovery is assumed as in fig 4 then implicitly η 1 examples of practical values of η 0 25 0 5 can be found in the literature landon et al 2013 kang et al 2016 pernia et al 2014 pernía et al 2012 since real world energy transfer circuits e g buck boost converters are not perfectly efficient it is important to report e v for at least two values of η e g 0 and 1 if there are multiple devices in series or parallel then e i n η e o u t and v d in eqn 9 must be summed appropriately a graphical example of e i n e o u t and δ t c y c l e for the cell examined herein is shown in fig 3a if the pumping energy is significant compared to the desalination energy e v then this number is important to report as well the pumping energy for a cdi cycle can be calculated as e p p q d t v d wh m3 where p is the pressure drop across the cell and the integral is over a cycle for the data in fig 4a and b the pumping energy is at worst 4 times lower than the desalination energy 5 wh m3 making it safe to assume that it is negligible 3 4 productivity for throughput we use the term productivity fig 1 pan et al 2017 which is given by 11 p v d n a δ t c y c l e where p is the productivity in l h m2 n is the number of cells electrode pairs in the cdi stack series and parallel and a is the projected face area cm2 of one cell as discussed above and illustrated in fig s2 in the si the productivity is simply a volume of diluate produced per unit time per projected face area of device since the separation condition i e δ c w r and c feed is already specified there is only a need to specify volume throughput and not an average removal rate like with asar normalizing by projected face area rather than electrode mass is more directly related to cell resistance and cost especially when membranes are used similarly volume throughput for a given separation is more closely tied to general desalination performance as opposed to salt removal rate ghaffour et al 2013 zhao et al 2013a which is more specific to cdi type desalination techniques 3 5 performance metric relationships finally it is important to understand the defined relationships between traditional performance metrics what we call here secondary performance metrics and those detailed above for instance recalling that the previous performance metrics asar and enas as defined in ref 26 are 12 a s a r δ n d n a δ t c y c l e 13 e n a s δ n d e i n η e o u t then comparing eqns 12 and 13 to eqns 6 and 9 11 reveals that 14 p a s a r δ c 15 e v δ c e n a s 16 e m e v δ c furthermore combining eqns 14 and 15 gives 17 p e v a s a r e n a s thus with δ c specified the volumetric metrics proposed here can be converted to the traditional molar parameters and vice versa note that here and throughout the paper unit conversions are implied the exercise of examining how various performance metrics in the cdi literature are related by definition is important because it reveals where metric comparisons do not necessarily give additional insight only relations by definition ultimately we chose to advocate for the two parameters e v and p because they reflect generally desirable desalination characteristics for any system regardless of its operating mechanism we do not advocate using molar based metrics because the end product of deionization is a volume of treated water not a mole of salt which makes volume normalized quantities of a more broad interest interestingly though enas by definition is e n a s δ c e v which gives a sense of how efficiently a given δ c is achieved however this number must be analyzed extremely carefully because the best values can often occur in a region of separation space that is irrelevant to practical applications i e low δ c thus various normalized analysis of desalination performance that deviates from fig 1 framework must be conducted with caution 3 6 non dss operation while dss cycling is the dominant mode of operation for cdi there are other operation modes like batch mode and flow electrode setups that require a different approach to calculating the various parameters described above in general though the approach depicted in fig 1 holds regardless of operation method for systems with flowable electrodes doornbusch et al 2016 the definitions eqns 1 11 still hold by replacing the specified integration time with the total experiment time for batch mode operation porada et al 2013b the individual quantities e i n η e o u t are obtained from integrated electrical power over the experiment time the relevant experiment time of fig 1 in batch mode is taken as both the time to desalinate and the time to regenerate the electrodes and fill the waste tank the final volumes eqs 1 and 2 and concentrations in batch mode are easily measured from the final state of the waste tank and treated tank 4 performance indicators in this section we will discuss parameters which we believe are highly useful for understanding cell performance and material limitations but are not performance metrics in and of themselves these parameters combined with the reported operational performance metrics above can help better understand why certain materials device architectures and operation modes are more suitable for cdi or in contrast are less suitable if the primary goal of the study is to evaluate a novel electrode material then such extra characterization is especially critical importantly the following descriptions are not meant to be comprehensive technical reviews but rather are included to lend context to the cdi performance metric indicator landscape 4 1 salt adsorption capacity we begin our performance indicator discussion with the salt adsorption capacity mg g which for a cdi cell over a dss cycle is given by 18 s a c m m δ n d where m is the molar mass of the salt g mol m is the total mass of electrodes in the cell g the sac is a function of operational flow efficiency defined below and in ref 26 and magnitude of adsorbed salt over a dss cycle hawks et al 2018 this is in contrast to the maximum salt adsorption capacity msac or identically equilibrium salt adsorption capacity eq sac which are taken at constant voltage equilibrium the eq sac value is best measured over many charging voltages to at least v 1 2 v with the discharge voltage typically set to zero a salinity of 20 mm and using nacl so that experiments can be compared between different studies guyes et al 2017 suss et al 2015 notably if the electrode material density is reported ρ e then different eq sac normalizations e g mg ml or mg g can be readily evaluated the strength of eq sac is that it is an indicator of the upper limit of desalination capacity over a given voltage window where higher values typically correspond to larger obtainable removals during operation i e higher possible concentration reductions and water recoveries however eq sac is not a desalination performance metric in and of itself and therefore cannot be used as a substitute for energy consumption and throughput eq sac is influenced by a combination parameters including equilibrium charge efficiency charging and discharging voltages point of zero charge pzc and material capacitance 4 2 capacitance and pzc the capacitance and pzc are important factors that underly sac and therefore also strongly impact the desalination capacity of a cell a discussion of capacitance characterization for electrochemical supercapacitors is given by zuliani et al zuliani et al 2015 and analysis of the material point of zero charge pzc and its influence on cdi performance can be found in avraham et al 2011 hemmatifar et al 2017 omosebi et al 2014 2015 in brief though the cell s differential capacitance can be evaluated through the use of the equation 19 c i d v d t 1 where v is the cell voltage v i is the current a and c is the capacitance f which can be converted to material capacitance f g or f cm3 by considering the electrodes in a cdi cell as two capacitors in series zuliani et al 2015 in terms of normalization zuliani et al 2015 gogotsi and simon 2011 the electrode volumetric capacitance in f cm3 is more relevant to cdi operation hawks et al 2018 but the gravimetric capacitance in f g has better comparability to electrochemical capacitors at large thus assessing both is important similar to sac if the electrode material density is reported then the volumetric and gravimetric capacitance values can be calculated from one another eqn 19 suffices for capacitance assessment of both supercapacitors and pseudocapacitors brousse et al 2015 however it may not be the best way to characterize intercalation storage mechanisms which are an emerging area of interest in cdi porada et al 2017 kim et al 2017 suss and presser 2018 in the case of charge storage by intercalation electrode capacity in mah cm3 and mah g and voltage window are perhaps more appropriate in contrast to energy storage studies the relevant material capacitance can be difficult to evaluate due to the low electrolyte concentrations pertinent to cdi operation e g 20 mm nacl at these low concentrations significant pzc depletion resistive and faradaic effects can obscure the capacitance evaluation by eqn 19 we find that in cc operation for example the discharge portion of the desalination cycle can often provide a somewhat reasonable estimation of c through eqn 19 this analysis is identical to evaluating the capacitance by the method of galvanostatic cycling which is a common approach for capacitance evaluation zuliani et al 2015 another way to measure capacitance is with cyclic voltammetry cv taken at concentrations and multiple sweep rates d v d t that are comparable to the ones used for desalination for such a cv measurement the electrode material pzc can be estimated from the voltage at which the capacitance from eqn 19 passes through a local minimum for purely comparative purposes the differential capacitance can be taken as the value of c at v 0 c v 0 see si fig s9 an illustration of these effects and cv analysis are presented in the si fig s9 including for the cell from figs 3 and 4 fig s1 if the cv is measured in a cdi cell then it can be done with sufficient flow rate such that depletion effects are avoided it is important that the cv is measured both over enough cycles such that dss is reached and at relevant concentrations since double layer capacitance scales non linearly with electrolyte concentration in the low ionic strength regime that is relevant to cdi other ways to measure the capacitance are by the galvanometric intermittent titration technique gitt or amperometric intermittent titration technique aitt which involve transferring a precise quantity of charge and measuring the change in voltage or changing the cell voltage and measuring the charge transferred respectively these methods have been routinely applied in cdi for carbon based materials zhao et al 2010 porada et al 2012 2013b a as well as recently applied for cdi with intercalation materials porada et al 2017 compared to cv gitt may be more applicable to intercalation materials porada et al 2017 and aitt might be more practical at low salinities e g 5 mm nacl porada et al 2012 guyes et al 2017 kim et al 2015 4 3 charge and coulombic efficiencies a further set of relevant performance indicators are the charge efficiency and coulombic efficiency which have been the subject of much research in cdi shanbhag et al 2016 zhao et al 2012 2010 avraham et al 2009 2010 gao et al 2014 kim et al 2015 hemmatifar et al 2016 in terms of dss cycling the charge transferred total cycle charge efficiency λ c y c l e and round trip coulombic efficiency η c o u l smith et al 2014 shanbhag et al 2016 are defined here by 20 q i n δ t c y c l e i d t where i 0 21 q o u t δ t c y c l e i d t where i 0 22 λ c y c l e f δ n d q i n 23 η c o u l q o u t q i n where q i n is the charge transferred at positive current c q o u t is the charge transferred at negative current c and f is faraday s constant 96485 c mol of the two periods of opposing current direction in eqns 19 and 20 we define positive current to be the charging step which is that period where the energy input was higher than in the period of opposing current sign alternatively if the voltage polarity does not change and one assumes charge conservation over a dss cycle then the charge transferred to the cell must not be greater than the charge released from the cell or q o u t q i n from this the definition of positive current in eqn 19 also follows a graphical example of q i n and q o u t for the cell examined herein is shown in fig 3c it should also be noted that there is some ambiguity in the literature regarding the use of q i n or q o u t in eqn 22 for instance λ c y c l e as defined here was referred to as the dynamic charge efficiency in refs 26 and 72 but in ref 71 the charge efficiency was taken as λ c y c l e η c o u l f δ n d q o u t the replacement of q i n with q o u t in eqn 22 can be done to partly factor out coulombic losses in the total cycle charge efficiency while the true capacitive charge transferred over a cycle lies somewhere between q i n and q o u t using the charge released is a reasonable approach as the capacitive charge transferred is generally expected to be closer to q o u t in general these efficiencies reflect the disparity between transferred electrical charge on one hand and salt deficiency or excess in the effluent stream on the other in typical unfunctionalized carbon based electrodes there are broadly three main reasons behind such disparities first at low potentials across the electric double layers co ion expulsion occurs to a significant extent compared to counterion adsorption leading to inefficient net adsorption second unwanted parasitic reactions can consume accumulated electric charge via faradaic reactions at one or more electrodes and finally a portion of the desalinated water inside the cell is often not recoverable due to operational effects hawks et al 2018 shang et al 2017 such effects are captured by the flow efficiency parameter hawks et al 2018 johnson and newman 1971 which is defined as the ratio of moles of salt removed from the effluent stream to the moles of salt adsorbed by the electrodes over a dss cycle hawks et al 2018 overall the total cycle charge efficiency is influenced by flow efficiency double layer and faradaic effects hawks et al 2018 and the round trip coulombic efficiency η c o u l of eqn 23 measures charge loss due to faradaic processes bazant 2013 pillay and newman 1996 taken together a full analysis of eqns 22 and 23 can yield significant insight as to where operational performance losses are being incurred 4 4 series resistance finally the series resistance is an important parameter that can help understand performance qu et al 2015 2016 dykstra et al 2016 energy loss in cdi occurs via primarily two processes energy dissipation through joule heating by current through the resistive elements in the system and unwanted faradaic reactions the resistive elements can be categorized as a series resistance and an ionic resistance within the electrode pores this series resistance includes external leads contact resistances at current collectors collector resistance often negligible and ionic resistance within the separator the impedance across the electrode thickness can be thought of as a distributed series parallel arrangement of ionic resistances capacitive surfaces and electronic resistance of the electrode material i e a transmission line posey and morozumi 1966 dunn and newman 2000 de levie 1964 while the series resistance clearly affects energy consumption qu et al 2016 hemmatifar et al 2016 it also influences operational performance through for example the r c charging time in cv operation and voltage window in cc operation here we define the total series resistance r s as the external electronic resistance r e e r plus the separator resistance r s p i e r s r e e r r s p dykstra et al 2016 in other words the series resistance is the resistance of every part of the system except the resistance of the electrolyte in the porous electrodes the external electronic resistance r e e r includes the resistance due to the current collector wires and contacts qu et al 2015 dykstra et al 2016 whereas the separator resistance r s p captures the ionic resistance across the separator according to 24 r s p l s p τ s p a κ p s p where l s p is the separator thickness μm τ s p is the separator tortuosity κ is the electrolyte conductivity in the separator ms cm and p s p is the separator porosity there is also a significant ionic transport resistance associated with the electrolyte in the macropores however this resistance is strongly frequency dependent being an electrical short at high frequency that ideally transitions to a capacitance in series with the electrolyte resistance at low frequency suss et al 2013 posey and morozumi 1966 dunn and newman 2000 de levie 1964 in terms of experiments the series resistance in particular can be readily measured with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis at high frequency e g 10 100 khz by taking the value of the real part of the impedance as the imaginary part tends to zero see si figs s10 and s11 it is important to note that high frequency eis measurements are capable of measuring the true r s whereas methods based on applying an abrupt current or voltage step and measuring the instantaneous response often captures a significant amount of electrode ionic resistance unless high time resolution equipment is used because eqn 24 is dependent on ion concentration r s will change dynamically throughout a cdi cycle due to changes in electrolyte conductivity from desalination and regeneration hemmatifar et al 2016 nevertheless eis measurements are useful for establishing a baseline for comparing different device architectures and better understanding differences in performance examples and illustrations of how to measure r s with eis are presented in section 6 of the si 5 parameter summary a summary of the essential separation conditions performance metrics and performance indicators that are discussed above are presented in table 1 in the si a table is given defining all parameters used in this work including those in table 1 we also add to tables s2 and s3 several essential cell characteristics that are highly valuable in interpreting desalination results for example the dry electrode material density is a critical electrode property that allows for conversion between gravimetric and volumetric parameters additionally the number of membranes used per cell is important for estimating the overall device cost as the membranes are typically a cost driving factor for the devices that use them finally general device geometric parameters like the electrode and separator thickness dry uncompressed are important basic cell characteristics that influence the magnitude of many of the discussed parameters the parameters in table 1 for the cell that underlies the results in fig 4 along with other important cell characteristics are summarized in a separation report in the si table s2 for convenience we also provide this report format in the form of a calculation spreadsheet written in generally available commercial software microsoft excel that can be downloaded and readily used for other studies 6 conclusions in summary we proposed a framework for quantifying cdi performance in terms of volumetric energy consumption wh m3 and throughput productivity l h m2 we demonstrated that reporting these metrics for equivalent separation conditions is essential for comparability and obtaining practically meaningful values for research purposes we proposed a nominal standard removal of 5 mm out of a 20 mm nacl feed stream at 50 water recovery for comparing new materials devices and operation modes using this separation we compare performance between a fte cdi cell and fb mcdi cell showing how significantly different systems can be compared in terms of generic desalination performance the need for introducing such a framework arises from previously used metrics being reported without specifying the removal conditions concentration reduction feed concentration and water recovery in general metric normalization must be carefully considered so to not allow evaluation at unspecified removal the rationale presented here resolves this issue and better aligns cdi performance reporting with the field of desalination in general finally for context we discuss various cell characteristics and performance indicators that are highly useful for understanding why certain performance metrics were measured taken together this work helps drive cdi in a direction towards more comparable and relevant performance evaluations so that this technology

19029,incorporating ru in a ni catalyst for gasification of phenol in supercritical water at 450 c and 30 min promoted formation of cyclohexanol via hydrogenation which is a key step toward gasification both ni and ni ru catalysts were effective to reduce the formation of cyclohexanone and oligomerization products compared with the case with no catalyst h2 and ch4 yields increased as the ru ni ratio increased as did the carbon and hydrogen yields in the gas phase products the ni80ru20 al2o3 catalyst provided good gasification performance and it exhibits ru 101 ru 100 and ni 111 facets and evidence of overlaid bimetallic particles dft calculations show that the presence of ru either as pure ru or as a ni ru alloy reduces the energy barrier for phenol hydrogenation by close to 0 2 ev relative to pure ni and that the energy barrier is not as largely affected by the amount of ru present provided it is non zero graphical abstract image 1 keywords phenol supercritical water

overall gasification efficiency huelsman and savage 2012 2013 savage 2000 indeed the apparent activation energies for h2 and ch4 formation from scwg of phenol are 170 kj mol 1 and 248 kj mol 1 respectively huelsman and savage 2012 these activation energies are higher than those for gas formation from biomass feedstocks such as lignin cellulose or algae this recalcitrance of phenol in scwg for many feedstocks has led to many prior studies on phenol scwg dileo et al 2007 guan et al 2016 huelsman and savage 2012 2013 jia et al 2017b ni based catalysts are often used in scwg as they can

biomass e intestinalis in 440 c the work described herein tests the ability of promising ni ru catalytic materials for gasifying phenol a recalcitrant compound frequently encountered during scwg of many feedstocks we select phenol because of its recalcitrance to scwg and its ubiquity if a catalyst shows promise for converting phenol to fuel gas via scwg it will likely also be effective for similarly converting a broad and diverse set of wet biomass and organic wastes into fuel gas additionally there has been no prior work on using ni ru catalysts for phenol scwg the work reported herein is unique in that we varied the ratio of ru to ni in the catalysts to fully understand the effect of incorporating the rather expensive ru in a base metal ni catalyst and we report results from integrated scwg experiments density functional theory dft calculations and catalyst characterization work which provides new insights into the mechanism and catalyst structure function relationship the relative amounts of ni and ru have not been previously explored and this work provides insights into the catalytic effect of these bimetallic materials in sum this work advances the development and fundamental understanding of practical and broadly applicable new catalysts for converting wet biomass and organic wastes to energy sources 2 experimental section 2 1 materials all chemicals e g helium acetone gas calibration standards were obtained commercially in high purity and used as received rucl3 and ni no3 2 6h2o were used as metal precursors for synthesis of ni ru bimetallic catalysts activated carbon al2o3 ceo2 and zro2 served as catalyst supports phenol was mixed with water to create a feed solution with 0 32 mol l at room temperature and pressure condition we used 316l stainless steel mini batch reactors with internal volume of 3 95 ml the reactors were constructed from a 10 mm port connector a cap a 10 mm to 3 mm reducing union and 200 mm length of 3 mm o d tubing and a high pressure needle valve prior to the reaction all the new reactors were pretreated with deionized water at 450 c and water density of 0 11 g ml for 30 min to ensure that any possible effects of reactor wall residues on the first experiment were eliminated 2 2 catalyst synthesis the catalysts were synthesized by the equal volume impregnation method first rucl3 and ni no3 2 6h2o were dissolved in deionized water according to the target metal loading and bimetallic metal ratio the metal precursor solution was stirred for 6 hours and then the desired amount of catalyst support was added and the mixture was stirred for 12 additional hours the solid material was dried in a vacuum dryer and then ground in a glass mortar subsequently the particles were calcined in a tube furnace in air where the temperature increased to 550 c at 3 c min and remained there for 240 min followed by natural cooling to room temperature after calcination the catalyst was reduced in flowing h2 at 400 c with the identical heating ramp and cooling rate all the ni ru catalysts used in this experimental study were loaded onto the supports at 30 wt we use nixruy support to represent the different catalysts in which x y are the mass percentage of metal in the total metal loading for example ni80ru20 al2o3 indicates that the metal is 80 ni and 20 ru and the support material is al2o3 2 3 scwg experiments all the scwg experiments were conducted at 450 c and an initial phenol concentration of 0 32 mol l unless otherwise specified the catalyst loading relative to the phenol feedstock the batch holding time and the water density were 10 wt 30 min and 0 11 g ml corresponding to a pressure of 25 mpa respectively after loading the feedstock solution and catalyst in the desired amounts the reactors were evacuated to 80 kpa to remove residual air then the reactors were pressurized to 0 3 mpa by helium which served as an internal standard for gas product analysis at the same time the gas tightness of the reactors was tested by immersing them in water the heat source was a salt bath comprising a temperature controller a thermocouple and a pot filled with nitrate salts kno3 nano3 5 4 which are in liquid state above 250 c the reaction time began when we placed the reactors into the preheated 450 c salt bath the reactors reached the set point temperature within approximately 2 min guo et al 2015 after the desired time had elapsed reactors were removed from the salt bath and immersed in a cold water bath where they remained for at least 40 min to quench the reaction 2 4 product

thermal conductivity detector tcd and a supelco 60 80 mesh carboxen 1000 packed column 15 ft 1 8 in o d using argon as the carrier gas the composition of the gaseous products was calculated from calibration curves and the molar yields were calculated from the known moles of internal standard gas he after the gas analysis the reactors were opened carefully and the internal surfaces were rinsed repeatedly by using deionized water 4 ml total volume and the product solution was moved into centrifuge tubes after centrifugal separation at 3000 r min for 20 min the supernatant was taken out by pipette and the used catalyst was washed by methanol and collected after dried under flowing nitrogen organic compounds in the liquid phase were identified using a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer

carbon content in liquid products was determined by a total organic carbon analyzer euro tech et1020a equipped with non dispersive infrared detector molar yields of individual products carbon and hydrogen were calculated as moles of an item of interest in the products relative to the moles of that item in the phenol loaded into the reactor at the start of the experiment 2 5 catalyst

to avoid interlayer periodic interactions we investigated three model catalysts ni ru and ni3ru in each case we studied the catalytic reaction on the stable and well coordinated low index facet for the respective space group specifically ni 111 ru 001 and ni3ru 111 for ni and ru we used a four layer thick slab with the bottom two layers fixed and the top two layers allowed to relax freely ni3ru was investigated as a representative bi metallic catalyst the model catalyst was created by replacing one of four ni atoms in fcc ni with ru and first optimizing the bulk structure atom coordinates and lattice parameters followed by cleaving the 111 facet the slab had 3 layers with the bottom layer fixed and the top two allowed to relax the most energetically stable adsorbate configurations were used in each case to calculate the energy profile for the reaction the climbing image nudged elastic band method with four intermediate images was employed to identify the respective transition states the activation barrier and heat of reaction were determined from the energies calculated for the initial final and transition states 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalytic scwg of phenol 3 1 1 gaseous products in this section we report the gas yields from scwg of phenol with no catalyst with ni and with ru ni containing up to 60 ru fig 1 shows the h2 ch4 and co2 yields from scwg of phenol at 450 c for 30 min we observed no co in these experiments presumably because any co produced would be rapidly converted to co2 via water gas shift the total gas yield was lowest in the absence of catalyst previous research concerning noncatalytic scwg of phenol by using quartz reactor at 500 c provided similar results huelsman and savage 2012 the ni catalyst provided much higher gas yields than did noncatalytic scwg these yields are similar to those jia et al 2017a reported h2 co2 and ch4 yields of 2 2 1 6 and 0 8 mol mol respectively from scwg of phenol over pure ni catalyst with 20 wt metal loading at 500 c 32 min batch holding time and water density of 0 1 g cm3 the addition of ru to the ni catalyst increased the gas yields and its higher heating value hhv further h2 gas yields increased from 1 44 with a ni catalyst to 1 82 mol mol as the ru content increased to 60 wt the co2 yield showed a similar trend up to 40 ru but then decreased the ch4 yield increased from 0 74 for pure ni to 1 80 mol mol as the ru content increased the effect of added ru in fig 1 is similar to that observed by guo et al for scwg of indole guo et al 2015 specifically they demonstrated that the co2 yield increased by about 50 and the ch4 yield doubled when a 50 50 ni ru bimetallic catalyst was used in place of a ni catalyst fig 2 demonstrates how the carbon yields in the liquid and gas products and the hydrogen atom yield in the gaseous products varied with the different ru metal ratio in catalysts in the absence of catalyst most of the carbon resided in the liquid phase as phenol only a small part was gasified the carbon yield in the gas products from catalytic reactions is significantly higher than that without catalyst and it increased with increasing ru metal content in the catalysts thus adding ru to the ni catalyst facilitated carbon transfer from the aqueous to the gas phase this promotion of gasification is consistent with ru having a higher activity than ni for c c bond scission byrd et al 2008 a low hydrogen yield in the gas products was observed without catalyst both ni and ni ru bimetallic catalysts significantly improved the hydrogen yield in the gas products and the ru metal content shows positive impact on the hydrogen yield the highest c and h yield in the gas products occurred at a ru metal content of 60 but the incremental improvement in carbon yield was small beyond a ru content of 20 given the small effect of ru beyond 20 wt and that ru is about 500 times more costly than ni there is likely little economic potential for catalysts with greater than 20 wt ru of course determining the optimal amount of ru to add to the ni catalyst would require a technoeconomic assessment that considers more than simply the catalyst cost 3 1 2 liquid products fig 3 shows the conversion of phenol and yields of acetone soluble products recovered from scwg of phenol at 450 c for 30 min without catalyst and over ni ni80ru20 ni60ru40 and ni40ru60 catalysts supported on al2o3 conversion of phenol was 5 without catalyst which is consistent with its refractory nature in scw and previous work by huelsman and savage 2013 the phenol conversions were much higher with added catalysts adding ru metal in ni catalysts resulted in higher phenol conversion but increasing the ru metal ratio beyond 20 had little effect on the conversion the major products from scwg with no added catalyst were toluene and cyclohexanone which formed along with smaller amounts of cyclohexanol 2 methylcyclopentanone cyclopentanone and p xylene we also observed traces of higher molecular weight material that could be oligomerization products coupling of phenoxy radicals is a possible mechanism for oligomerization the major liquid phase product over all the catalysts was cyclohexanol 4 4 7 8 mol yield and p xylene 0 1 mol yield and toluene 1 5 1 9 mol yield were present in lesser amounts we did not observe any oligomerization products when using the ru catalysts which is consistent with guan et al 2016 who reported that ru ceo2 effectively suppressed the formation of dimers and pahs during scwg of phenol the presence of the methylated products could be due to alkylation reactions with simultaneous dehydration reaction crisafulli et al 1999 lu et al 2008 rabe et al 2010 valdes martinez et al 2017 the cycloalkane derivatives are not stable in scw and may decompose via steam reforming to form gaseous products crisafulli et al 1999 guan et al 2016 guczi et al 1986a tada et al 2013 cyclohexanone cyclopentanone and methylcyclopentanone were not observed in the catalytic reactions indicating that their conversion was facilitated by the catalysts we speculate that hydrogenation of phenol is a key rate determining step in the scwg pathways this step leads to the saturated compounds that are more readily decomposed to gaseous compounds in addition to providing a higher phenol conversion the ni ru bimetallic catalysts provide higher yields of cyclohexane derivatives than did pure ni indicating that adding ru to the ni catalyst promoted hydrogenation of phenol previous work valdes martinez et al 2017 shows that a small amount of ru can improve the ni dispersion which could enhance the activity of the ni ru bimetallic catalyst fig 3 shows that the toluene molar yield over all of the tested catalysts was lower than that from the noncatalytic reaction suggesting again that the catalysts promoted hydrogenation of aromatic rings by using the hydrogen produced from gasification guan et al 2016 combining the results for both the gas and liquid phase products we see that incorporating ru increased the ch4 yield and facilitated c c bond rupture of hydrogenated intermediates which agrees with previous research on pure ru catalyst byrd et al 2008 the gas and liquid product yields discussed in the previous sections provide clues regarding the scwg reaction pathways of phenol over these catalysts without catalyst the phenol conversion is low and cyclohexanone and toluene are the most abundant products by comparison the catalytic conditions gave higher yields of cyclohexanol suggesting both ni and ni ru have hydrogenation activity guan et al 2016 also found cyclohexanol as a hydrogenated intermediate product from catalytic scwg of phenol ru ceo2 500 c which is consistent with this work the increasing ch4 and h2 yields with the increasing ru metal ratio suggests that incorporating more ru in the ni catalysts improved c c bond breaking and steam reforming reactions of the hydrogenated intermediates which would be less stable than phenol interconversion among the gaseous products co ch4 co2 and h2 may also take place via reactions such as methanation and water gas shift catalyst supports provide effective surface and suitable pore structure and enhance the mechanical strength of catalysts bulushev and ross 2011 vaudry et al 1996 some supports may also have interactions with active metals force et al 2001 gulyaev et al 2012 guo et al 2015 kugai et al 2006 in a set of experiments independent of those previously reported in this article we tested the effect of different catalyst supports on the scwg of phenol with a ni80ru20 catalyst but found no remarkable effects the detailed results are shown in figs s1 and s2 kang et al 2016 reported catalytic activity of ni based ni co ni cu ni ce catalysts on five different supports al2o3 activated carbon ac tio2 zro2 mgo for scwg of lignin the result shows that the gas yield followed the order al2o3 tio2 ac zro2 mgo which is consistent with the small variations in the present results as well 3 2 dft calculation for hydrogenation of phenol we used dft calculations to understand the effect of added ru on the ni catalyst and the absence of much effect of increased ru content on the phenol conversion as mentioned before we hypothesize that the energetically demanding hydrogenation of phenol is a key step in its decomposition in particular the first hydrogenation barrier is expected to be the highest because this step pays the energy penalty for breaking the ring aromaticity mittendorfer and hafner 2002 saeys et al 2003 we calculated the activation barrier for the first hydrogenation step on three model surfaces as a predictor for catalytic activity with respect to phenol conversion we used a horiuti polanyi type scheme to model the hydrogenation of phenol starting with a pre adsorbed phenol molecule on the surface in the most energetically stable configuration this model has been commonly employed to study hydrocarbon hydrogenation reactions horiuti and polanyi 1934 mattson et al 2013 saeys et al 2003 including benzene hydrogenation on ni 111 mittendorfer and hafner 2002 for both ni and ru a bridge configuration fig 4 a and c was found to be most stable various bridge configurations are possible for ni3ru based on the relative position of the ru atom and the c oh group the most energetically favorable configuration is shown in fig 4 b fig 5 a c shows the initial state transition state and final configuration for the first hydrogenation of phenol on ni 111 as a representative example the activation barrier and heat of reaction for each case are presented in table 1 the presence of ru significantly reduces the endothermicity and activation barrier of the reaction relative to pure ni thus dft results indicate that the presence of ru either as pure ru or as a ni ru alloy is likely to increase the rate of phenol hydrogenation through a lowering of the activation barrier by close to 0 2 ev compared to pure ni further the large difference in energetics while moving from ni to ni3ru 25 ru compared to the much smaller changes when moving from ni3ru to ru is consistent with the experimental observation that the phenol conversion is largely unaffected by the ru content provided it is non zero thus the dft results are consistent with the present experimental results in that the activity is predicted to increase upon adding a small amount 20 of ru to ni and show much less change with additional increase in the ru content 3 3 ni ru catalysts before and after scwg of phenol we characterized the ni80ru20 al2o3 catalyst to shed light on its composition and particle size crystal phase and oxidation state fig 6 shows the scanning electron microscope sem and transmission electron microscope tem images of the ni80ru20 al2o3 catalyst the sem image in fig 6 a shows the surface morphology of the al2o3 supported ni80ru20 nanoparticles the nanoparticles are well dispersed on the surface of cubic or plate like al2o3 structures in addition fig 6 c and d shows that both ni and ru were present throughout the catalyst which confirms its bimetallic nature fig 6 b shows the tem image of the metal nanoparticles dark spots on the al2o3 support and it consists of some large particles 100 200 nm and many smaller particles in the range of 5 20 nm as shown in fig 6 e the high resolution tem hrtem image confirms the crystalline nature of the small nanoparticles the top particle showed a measured d spacing of 0 238 nm the fft pattern matches with 100 planes of ru fig 6 f and g the bottom particle showed a measured d spacing of 0 206 nm and the fft pattern matches with 111 planes of ni fig 6 h and i chen et al 2012 combined with the eds data the supported ni80ru20 al2o3 has a mixture of monometallic and bimetallic nanoparticles as will be confirmed later by xrd and tpr fig 7 shows the xrd patterns of the fresh and used catalysts with various ni ru ratios we identified peaks that correspond to ni and its oxides ru and its oxides and the support al2o3 all of the fresh catalysts with different ni ru ratios exhibit strong diffraction peaks at 44 46 51 74 and 76 32 corresponding to the 111 200 and 220 planes of ni pdf 04 0835 four small peaks at 37 33 43 46 62 98 and 79 62 can be assigned to the 111 200 110 and 015 planes of nio pdf 78 0423 which is attributed to the inevitable oxidation that occurs during catalysts synthesis and xrd sample preparation the nio peak observed at 37 33 for pure ni catalyst become broader and weaker with increasing ru content as demonstrated in fig 7 b this effect could be from a better dispersion of ru in the ni metal lattice which is consistent with the smaller size of the metal particles mori et al 2016 and further weakened the xrd signal zhang et al 2014a 2014b reported that noble metal facilitated ni reduction to decrease the particle size there are five peaks at around 38 50 42 32 58 52 78 46 and 85 29 representing the 100 002 102 103 and 112 crystal planes of ru pdf 02 1258 and the peaks at 69 85 can be assigned to the 301 planes of ruo2 pdf 18 1139 a very weak ruo2 peak can be noticed only at high ru content ni60ru40 indicating most ruo2 is reduced to its metallic state after h2 reduction and the ru0 species is essentially retained in metallic form before the scwg reaction the peak at 66 90 corresponds to the 440 plane of al2o3 pdf 50 0741 the detailed crystal structure information for these peaks is shown in table 1s ni pdf 04 0835 and ru pdf 02 1258 in both ni80ru20 and ni40ru60 catalyst were simultaneously detected at 44 46 and 76 32 respectively which is consistent with the highly crystalline structures from hrtem image addition of a second metal may result in a peak shift for a base metal in xrd analysis park et al 2002 we found the ni0 peak slightly shifts towards lower angles with an increase in ru metal content as shown in fig 8 c according to the ni ru phase diagram danilenko et al 1999 ni0 is enriched with ru0 in the solid solution only at the reduction temperature higher than 850 c rynkowski et al 1995a and shiraga et al 2007 also reported the shifting of ni0 peaks to lower angles the results suggest the insertion of ru0 in the ni0 lattice and formation of ni ru bimetallic particles the xrd patterns of the used catalysts are presented in fig 8 for the pure ni catalyst the nio peaks are significantly stronger and the ni peaks are weaker after use for scwg as shown in fig 8 a this result is consistent with the ni metal being oxidized during scwg fig 8 b compares ni80ru20 and ni60ru40 catalysts before and after scwg reactions no nio peaks can found in either used catalyst suggesting oxidation of ni can be suppressed by incorporating ru metal the small differences in both the ni and ru peaks between fresh and used catalysts suggests that the addition of ru improved the stability of the catalysts as well compared with the change in pure ni before and after scwg reactions elliott 2008 elliott et al 2006 we used h2 temperature programmed reduction h2 tpr to probe the reducibility or oxidation state of the active metals in the supported catalysts hossain et al 2017 myint et al 2016 with the aim to directly compare the reduction process of bimetallic ru ni with the monometallic catalysts we prepared monometallic ni and ru catalysts with the same synthesis method used for the bimetallic catalysts the h2 tpr results are shown in fig 9 the ru al2o3 catalyst shows peaks at 140 c 163 c and 200 c the two main peaks at the lower temperatures are associated with the reduction of ru oxide particles in different forms of interaction on the al2o3 surface valdes martinez et al 2017 hossain et al 2017 reported that the peak at 140 c is due to the reduction of well dispersed ruo2 species which have a weak interaction with the support liu et al 2008 the peak around 163 c represents the reduction of bulk ruo2 species which would have weak interactions with the catalyst support the last peak at 200 c is associated with the reduction of complex ruo2 with different forms of interaction with the al2o3 surface guczi et al 1986b for the ni al2o3 catalyst the only peak present is at 390 c and it corresponds to the reduction of bulk nio the bimetallic ni ru catalyst shows peaks at 170 c 190 c 270 c and 362 c the peaks at 170 c and 190 c can be related to the reduction of ruo2 whereas the peak at 362 c corresponds to the reduction of nio due to the metal interactions the reduction of easily reducible metal oxide may enhance the reduction of the other metal oxide so that both metal oxides may be reduced at the same time to form bimetallic particles rynkowski et al 1995b tada et al 2014 valdes martinez et al 2017 the sharp peak at 270 c is ascribed to the co reduction of nio and ruo2 present on the support surface which likely forms ni ru bimetallic particles hossain et al 2017 the tpr results for the ni ru catalyst indicates the existence of mixture of monometallic and bimetallic nanoparticles consistent with the tem eds and xrd results table s2 shows physical properties of the fresh and used catalysts on four different catalyst supports for all four supports the bet surface area pore volume average pore size and metal dispersion decreased after the 30 min scwg reaction at 450 c 4 conclusion incorporating ru in a ni catalyst promotes formation of cyclohexanol during the reaction of phenol in supercritical water this enhanced hydrogenation activity also promotes subsequent gasification reactions as saturated compounds are generally easier to gasify in supercritical water than are aromatics the ru20ni80 catalyst appears to offer good balance between gasification activity and cost i e ru content indeed dft calculations showed that a large decrease in the energy barrier for phenol hydrogenation occurred when going from a ni surface to ni3ru but a much smaller decrease accompanied the change from ni3ru to pure ru the catalyst supports tested have no significant effect on the reactions bet area pore volume average pore size and metal dispersion for all catalysts decrease after 30 min reaction in supercritical water ni ru and bimetallic particles are dispersed on the al2o3 support and the ru particles are evenly distributed amongst the ni particles the ni80ru20 al2o3 catalyst exhibits well defined ru 101 ru 100 and ni 111 facets declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

19029,incorporating ru in a ni catalyst for gasification of phenol in supercritical water at 450 c and 30 min promoted formation of cyclohexanol via hydrogenation which is a key step toward gasification both ni and ni ru catalysts were effective to reduce the formation of cyclohexanone and oligomerization products compared with the case with no catalyst h2 and ch4 yields increased as the ru ni ratio increased as did the carbon and hydrogen yields in the gas phase products the ni80ru20 al2o3 catalyst provided good gasification performance and it exhibits ru 101 ru 100 and ni 111 facets and evidence of overlaid bimetallic particles dft calculations show that the presence of ru either as pure ru or as a ni ru alloy reduces the energy barrier for phenol hydrogenation by close to 0 2 ev relative to pure ni and that the energy barrier is not as largely affected by the amount of ru present provided it is non zero graphical abstract image 1 keywords phenol supercritical water

overall gasification efficiency huelsman and savage 2012 2013 savage 2000 indeed the apparent activation energies for h2 and ch4 formation from scwg of phenol are 170 kj mol 1 and 248 kj mol 1 respectively huelsman and savage 2012 these activation energies are higher than those for gas formation from biomass feedstocks such as lignin cellulose or algae this recalcitrance of phenol in scwg for many feedstocks has led to many prior studies on phenol scwg dileo et al 2007 guan et al 2016 huelsman and savage 2012 2013 jia et al 2017b ni based catalysts are often used in scwg as they can

form on the support material zhang et al zhang et al 2011a b studied ni ru al2o3 in scwg and found that doping with ru can improve the dispersion and stability in recent work published by ahmad tavasoli et al norouzi et al 2017 2 wt ru promoted ni fe γ al2o3 with higher dispersion and smaller size of nickel on γ al2o3 was found having the best performance during scwg of the real algal biomass e intestinalis in 440 c the work described herein tests the ability of promising ni ru catalytic materials for gasifying phenol a recalcitrant compound frequently encountered during scwg of many feedstocks we select phenol because of its recalcitrance to scwg and its ubiquity if a catalyst shows promise for converting phenol to fuel gas via scwg it will likely also be effective for similarly converting a broad and diverse set of wet biomass and organic wastes into fuel gas additionally there has been no prior work on using ni ru catalysts for phenol scwg the work reported herein is unique in that we varied the ratio of ru to ni in the catalysts to fully understand the effect of incorporating the rather expensive ru in a base metal ni catalyst and we report results from integrated scwg experiments density functional theory dft calculations and catalyst characterization work which provides new insights into the mechanism and catalyst structure function relationship the relative amounts of ni and ru have not been previously explored and this work provides insights into the catalytic effect of these bimetallic materials in sum this work advances the development and fundamental understanding of practical and broadly applicable new catalysts for converting wet biomass and organic wastes to energy sources 2 experimental section 2 1 materials all chemicals e g helium acetone gas calibration standards were obtained commercially in high purity and used as received rucl3 and ni no3 2 6h2o were used as metal precursors for synthesis of ni ru bimetallic catalysts activated carbon al2o3 ceo2 and zro2 served as catalyst supports phenol was mixed with water to create a feed solution with 0 32 mol l at room temperature and pressure condition we used 316l stainless steel mini batch reactors with internal volume of 3 95 ml the reactors were constructed from a 10 mm port connector a cap a 10 mm to 3 mm reducing union and 200 mm length of 3 mm o d tubing and a high pressure needle valve prior to the reaction all the new reactors were pretreated with deionized water at 450 c and water density of 0 11 g ml for 30 min to ensure that any possible effects of reactor wall residues on the first experiment were eliminated 2 2 catalyst synthesis the catalysts were synthesized by the equal volume impregnation method first rucl3 and ni no3 2 6h2o were dissolved in deionized water according to the target metal loading and bimetallic metal ratio the metal precursor solution was stirred for 6 hours and then the desired amount of catalyst support was added and the mixture was stirred for 12 additional hours the solid material was dried in a vacuum dryer and then ground in a glass mortar subsequently the particles were calcined in a tube furnace in air where the temperature increased to 550 c at 3 c min and remained there for 240 min followed by natural cooling to room temperature after calcination the catalyst was reduced in flowing h2 at 400 c with the identical heating ramp and cooling rate all the ni ru catalysts used in this experimental study were loaded onto the supports at 30 wt we use nixruy support to represent the different catalysts in which x y are the mass percentage of metal in the total metal loading for example ni80ru20 al2o3 indicates that the metal is 80 ni and 20 ru and the support material is al2o3 2 3 scwg experiments all the scwg experiments were conducted at 450 c and an initial phenol concentration of 0 32 mol l unless otherwise specified the catalyst loading relative to the phenol feedstock the batch holding time and the water density were 10 wt 30 min and 0 11 g ml corresponding to a pressure of 25 mpa respectively after loading the feedstock solution and catalyst in the desired amounts the reactors were evacuated to 80 kpa to remove residual air then the reactors were pressurized to 0 3 mpa by helium which served as an internal standard for gas product analysis at the same time the gas tightness of the reactors was tested by immersing them in water the heat source was a salt bath comprising a temperature controller a thermocouple and a pot filled with nitrate salts kno3 nano3 5 4 which are in liquid state above 250 c the reaction time began when we placed the reactors into the preheated 450 c salt bath the reactors reached the set point temperature within approximately 2 min guo et al 2015 after the desired time had elapsed reactors were removed from the salt bath and immersed in a cold water bath where they remained for at least 40 min to quench the reaction 2 4 product

thermal conductivity detector tcd and a supelco 60 80 mesh carboxen 1000 packed column 15 ft 1 8 in o d using argon as the carrier gas the composition of the gaseous products was calculated from calibration curves and the molar yields were calculated from the known moles of internal standard gas he after the gas analysis the reactors were opened carefully and the internal surfaces were rinsed repeatedly by using deionized water 4 ml total volume and the product solution was moved into centrifuge tubes after centrifugal separation at 3000 r min for 20 min the supernatant was taken out by pipette and the used catalyst was washed by methanol and collected after dried under flowing nitrogen organic compounds in the liquid phase were identified using a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer gc ms agilent 5973 6890 equipped with a hp 5ms capillary column 30 0 cm 0 25 mm 0 25 μm the samples were diluted in 4 ml acetone prior to injection helium served as the carrier gas 1 0 ml min with a split ratio of 20 1 compounds were quantified on a shimadzu gc 2014c equipped with an identical column and a flame ionization detector gc fid nitrogen served as the carrier gas with a split ratio of

carbon content in liquid products was determined by a total organic carbon analyzer euro tech et1020a equipped with non dispersive infrared detector molar yields of individual products carbon and hydrogen were calculated as moles of an item of interest in the products relative to the moles of that item in the phenol loaded into the reactor at the start of the experiment 2 5 catalyst characterization the bet surface area pore size and pore volume of the fresh and used catalysts were measured by using n2 and he adsorption and desorption isotherms according to the bet model gold app v sorb 2800 powder x ray diffraction xrd patterns were determined using cu kα radiation at 40 kv and 40 ma λ 1 5408 å in the 2θ range from 20 to 90 with the scanning speed of 8 min pan analytical b v x pert propw 3040160 the oxidation states of the fresh catalysts were measured with a chemisorption instrument quantachrome auto iqc tpx using temperature programmed reduction h2 tpr the reducing gas was 10 hydrogen and 90 argon the sample was pretreated with helium before the test after helium flowed for 10 min the sample was heated to 150 c at 10 c minute and he continued for another 60 min after the pretreatment the furnace temperature was reduced to 50 c flow of the reducing gas began and the thermal conductivity detector tcd was switched on to collect the tpr data as the furnace temperature rose to 450 c at 10 c min the catalyst morphology and composition were measured by scanning electron microscope sem with the extra high tension eht of 15 kv at a working distance wd of 7 5

dispersed in ethanol and 5 μl of the sample was drop cast on a duplex copper ring for tem imaging lattice spacing and fast fourier transform fft pattern were obtained by imagej software 2 6 density functional theory calculation all density functional theory calculations were performed using the vienna ab initio software package vasp horiuti and polanyi 1934 kresse and furthmuller 1996 kresse and hafner 1993 the perdew burke ernzerhof pbe generalized gradient approximation perdew et al 1996 was applied with a plane wave basis set with an energy cut off of 450 ev and a 2x2x1 monkhorst pack k point mesh monkhorst and pack 1976 structural optimization was stopped when the force on each atom was less than 0 05 ev å in each case a 15 å vacuum was introduced above the surface and normal to it to avoid interlayer periodic interactions we investigated three model catalysts ni ru and ni3ru in each case we studied the catalytic reaction on the stable and well coordinated low index facet for the respective space group specifically ni 111 ru 001 and ni3ru 111 for ni and ru we used a four layer thick slab with the bottom two layers fixed and the top two layers allowed to relax freely ni3ru was investigated as a representative bi metallic catalyst the model catalyst was created by replacing one of four ni atoms in fcc ni with ru and first optimizing the bulk structure atom coordinates and lattice parameters followed by cleaving the 111 facet the slab had 3 layers with the bottom layer fixed and the top two allowed to relax the most energetically stable adsorbate configurations were used in each case to calculate the energy profile for the reaction the climbing image nudged elastic band method with four intermediate images was employed to identify the respective transition states the activation barrier and heat of reaction were determined from the energies calculated for the initial final and transition states 3 results and discussion 3 1 catalytic scwg of phenol 3 1 1 gaseous products in this section we report the gas yields from scwg of phenol with no catalyst with ni and with ru ni containing up to 60 ru fig 1 shows the h2 ch4 and co2 yields from scwg of phenol at 450 c for 30 min we observed no co in these experiments presumably because any co produced would be rapidly converted to co2 via water gas shift the total gas yield was lowest in the absence of catalyst previous research concerning noncatalytic scwg of phenol by using quartz reactor at 500 c provided similar results huelsman and savage 2012 the ni catalyst provided much higher gas yields than did noncatalytic scwg these yields are similar to those jia et al 2017a reported h2 co2 and ch4 yields of 2 2 1 6 and 0 8 mol mol respectively from scwg of phenol over pure ni catalyst with 20 wt metal loading at 500 c 32 min batch holding time and water density of 0 1 g cm3 the addition of ru to the ni catalyst increased the gas yields and its higher heating value hhv further h2 gas yields increased from 1 44 with a ni catalyst to 1 82 mol mol as the ru content increased to 60 wt the co2 yield showed a similar trend up to 40 ru but then decreased the ch4 yield increased from 0 74 for pure ni to 1 80 mol mol as the ru content increased the effect of added ru in fig 1 is similar to that observed by guo et al for scwg of indole guo et al 2015 specifically they demonstrated that the co2 yield increased by about 50 and the ch4 yield doubled when a 50 50 ni ru bimetallic catalyst was used in place of a ni catalyst fig 2 demonstrates how the carbon yields in the liquid and gas products and the hydrogen atom yield in the gaseous products varied with the different ru metal ratio in catalysts in the absence of catalyst most of the carbon resided in the liquid phase as phenol only a small part was gasified the carbon yield in the gas products from catalytic reactions is significantly higher than that without catalyst and it increased with increasing ru metal content in the catalysts thus adding ru to the ni catalyst facilitated carbon transfer from the aqueous to the gas phase this promotion of gasification is consistent with ru having a higher activity than ni for c c bond scission byrd et al 2008 a low hydrogen yield in the gas products was observed without catalyst both ni and ni ru bimetallic catalysts significantly improved the hydrogen yield in the gas products and the ru metal content shows positive impact on the hydrogen yield the highest c and h yield in the gas products occurred at a ru metal content of 60 but the incremental improvement in carbon yield was small beyond a ru content of 20 given the small effect of ru beyond 20 wt and that ru is about 500 times more costly than ni there is likely little economic potential for catalysts with greater than 20 wt ru of course determining the optimal amount of ru to add to the ni catalyst would require a technoeconomic assessment that considers more than simply the catalyst cost 3 1 2 liquid products fig 3 shows the conversion of phenol and yields of acetone soluble products recovered from scwg of phenol at 450 c for 30 min without catalyst and over ni ni80ru20 ni60ru40 and ni40ru60 catalysts supported on al2o3 conversion of phenol was 5 without catalyst which is consistent with its refractory nature in scw and previous work by huelsman and savage 2013 the phenol conversions were much higher with added catalysts adding ru metal in ni catalysts resulted in higher phenol conversion but increasing the ru metal ratio beyond 20 had little effect on the conversion the major products from scwg with no added catalyst were toluene and cyclohexanone which formed along with smaller amounts of cyclohexanol 2 methylcyclopentanone cyclopentanone and p xylene we also observed traces of higher molecular weight material that could be oligomerization products coupling of phenoxy radicals is a possible mechanism for oligomerization the major liquid phase product over all the catalysts was cyclohexanol 4 4 7 8 mol yield and p xylene 0 1 mol yield and toluene 1 5 1 9 mol yield were present in lesser amounts we did not observe any oligomerization products when using the ru catalysts which is consistent with guan et al 2016 who reported that ru ceo2 effectively suppressed the formation of dimers and pahs during scwg of phenol the presence of the methylated products could be due to alkylation reactions with simultaneous dehydration reaction crisafulli et al 1999 lu et al 2008 rabe et al 2010 valdes martinez et al 2017 the cycloalkane derivatives are not stable in scw and may decompose via steam reforming to form gaseous products crisafulli et al 1999 guan et al 2016 guczi et al 1986a tada et al 2013 cyclohexanone cyclopentanone and methylcyclopentanone were not observed in the catalytic reactions indicating that their conversion was facilitated by the catalysts we speculate that hydrogenation of phenol is a key rate determining step in the scwg pathways this step leads to the saturated compounds that are more readily decomposed to gaseous compounds in addition to providing a higher phenol conversion the ni ru bimetallic catalysts provide higher yields of cyclohexane derivatives than did pure ni indicating that adding ru to the ni catalyst promoted hydrogenation of phenol previous work valdes martinez et al 2017 shows that a small amount of ru can improve the ni dispersion which could enhance the activity of the ni ru bimetallic catalyst fig 3 shows that the toluene molar yield over all of the tested catalysts was lower than that from the noncatalytic reaction suggesting again that the catalysts promoted hydrogenation of aromatic rings by using the hydrogen produced from gasification guan et al 2016 combining the results for both the gas and liquid phase products we see that incorporating ru increased the ch4 yield and facilitated c c bond rupture of hydrogenated intermediates which agrees with previous research on pure ru catalyst byrd et al 2008 the gas and liquid product yields discussed in the previous sections provide clues regarding the scwg reaction pathways of phenol over these catalysts without catalyst the phenol conversion is low and cyclohexanone and toluene are the most abundant products by comparison the catalytic conditions gave higher yields of cyclohexanol suggesting both ni and ni ru have hydrogenation activity guan et al 2016 also found cyclohexanol as a hydrogenated intermediate product from catalytic scwg of phenol ru ceo2 500 c which is consistent with this work the increasing ch4 and h2 yields with the increasing ru metal ratio suggests that incorporating more ru in the ni catalysts improved c c bond breaking and steam reforming reactions of the hydrogenated intermediates which would be less stable than phenol interconversion among the gaseous products co ch4 co2 and h2 may also take place via reactions such as methanation and water gas shift catalyst supports provide effective surface and suitable pore structure and enhance the mechanical strength of catalysts bulushev and ross 2011 vaudry et al 1996 some supports may also have interactions with active metals force et al 2001 gulyaev et al 2012 guo et al 2015 kugai et al 2006 in a set of experiments independent of those previously reported in this article we tested the effect of different catalyst supports on the scwg of phenol with a ni80ru20 catalyst but found no remarkable effects the detailed results are shown in figs s1 and s2 kang et al 2016 reported catalytic activity of ni based ni co ni cu ni ce catalysts on five different supports al2o3 activated carbon ac tio2 zro2 mgo for scwg of lignin the result shows that the gas yield followed the order al2o3 tio2 ac zro2 mgo which is consistent with the small variations in the present results as well 3 2 dft calculation for hydrogenation of phenol we used dft calculations to understand the effect of added ru on the ni catalyst and the absence of much effect of increased ru content on the phenol conversion as mentioned before we hypothesize that the energetically demanding hydrogenation of phenol is a key step in its decomposition in particular the first hydrogenation barrier is expected to be the highest because this step pays the energy penalty for breaking the ring aromaticity mittendorfer and hafner 2002 saeys et al 2003 we calculated the activation barrier for the first hydrogenation step on three model surfaces as a predictor for catalytic activity with respect to phenol conversion we used a horiuti polanyi type scheme to model the hydrogenation of phenol starting with a pre adsorbed phenol molecule on the surface in the most energetically stable configuration this model has been commonly employed to study hydrocarbon hydrogenation reactions horiuti and polanyi 1934 mattson et al 2013 saeys et al 2003 including benzene hydrogenation on ni 111 mittendorfer and hafner 2002 for both ni and ru a bridge configuration fig 4 a and c was found to be most stable various bridge configurations are possible for ni3ru based on the relative position of the ru atom and the c oh group the most energetically favorable configuration is shown in fig 4 b fig 5 a c shows the initial state transition state and final configuration for the first hydrogenation of phenol on ni 111 as a representative example the activation barrier and heat of reaction for each case are presented in table 1 the presence of ru significantly reduces the endothermicity and activation barrier of the reaction relative to pure ni thus dft results indicate that the presence of ru either as pure ru or as a ni ru alloy is likely to increase the rate of phenol hydrogenation through a lowering of the activation barrier by close to 0 2 ev compared to pure ni further the large difference in energetics while moving from ni to ni3ru 25 ru compared to the much smaller changes when moving from ni3ru to ru is consistent with the experimental observation that the phenol conversion is largely unaffected by the ru content provided it is non zero thus the dft results are consistent with the present experimental results in that the activity is predicted to increase upon adding a small amount 20 of ru to ni and show much less change with additional increase in the ru content 3 3 ni ru catalysts before and after scwg of phenol we characterized the ni80ru20 al2o3 catalyst to shed light on its composition and particle size crystal phase and oxidation state fig 6 shows the scanning electron microscope sem and transmission electron microscope tem images of the ni80ru20 al2o3 catalyst the sem image in fig 6 a shows the surface morphology of the al2o3 supported ni80ru20 nanoparticles the nanoparticles are well dispersed on the surface of cubic or plate like al2o3 structures in addition fig 6 c and d shows that both ni and ru were present throughout the catalyst which confirms its bimetallic nature fig 6 b shows the tem image of the metal nanoparticles dark spots on the al2o3 support and it consists of some large particles 100 200 nm and many smaller particles in the range of 5 20 nm as shown in fig 6 e the high resolution tem hrtem image confirms the crystalline nature of the small nanoparticles the top particle showed a measured d spacing of 0 238 nm the fft pattern matches with 100 planes of ru fig 6 f and g the bottom particle showed a measured d spacing of 0 206 nm and the fft pattern matches with 111 planes of ni fig 6 h and i chen et al 2012 combined with the eds data the supported ni80ru20 al2o3 has a mixture of monometallic and bimetallic nanoparticles as will be confirmed later by xrd and tpr fig 7 shows the xrd patterns of the fresh and used catalysts with various ni ru ratios we identified peaks that correspond to ni and its oxides ru and its oxides and the support al2o3 all of the fresh catalysts with different ni ru ratios exhibit strong diffraction peaks at 44 46 51 74 and 76 32 corresponding to the 111 200 and 220 planes of ni pdf 04 0835 four small peaks at 37 33 43 46 62 98 and 79 62 can be assigned to the 111 200 110 and 015 planes of nio pdf 78 0423 which is attributed to the inevitable oxidation that occurs during catalysts synthesis and xrd sample preparation the nio peak observed at 37 33 for pure ni catalyst become broader and weaker with increasing ru content as demonstrated in fig 7 b this effect could be from a better dispersion of ru in the ni metal lattice which is consistent with the smaller size of the metal particles mori et al 2016 and further weakened the xrd signal zhang et al 2014a 2014b reported that noble metal facilitated ni reduction to decrease the particle size there are five peaks at around 38 50 42 32 58 52 78 46 and 85 29 representing the 100 002 102 103 and 112 crystal planes of ru pdf 02 1258 and the peaks at 69 85 can be assigned to the 301 planes of ruo2 pdf 18 1139 a very weak ruo2 peak can be noticed only at high ru content ni60ru40 indicating most ruo2 is reduced to its metallic state after h2 reduction and the ru0 species is essentially retained in metallic form before the scwg reaction the peak at 66 90 corresponds to the 440 plane of al2o3 pdf 50 0741 the detailed crystal structure information for these peaks is shown in table 1s ni pdf 04 0835 and ru pdf 02 1258 in both ni80ru20 and ni40ru60 catalyst were simultaneously detected at 44 46 and 76 32 respectively which is consistent with the highly crystalline structures from hrtem image addition of a second metal may result in a peak shift for a base metal in xrd analysis park et al 2002 we found the ni0 peak slightly shifts towards lower angles with an increase in ru metal content as shown in fig 8 c according to the ni ru phase diagram danilenko et al 1999 ni0 is enriched with ru0 in the solid solution only at the reduction temperature higher than 850 c rynkowski et al 1995a and shiraga et al 2007 also reported the shifting of ni0 peaks to lower angles the results suggest the insertion of ru0 in the ni0 lattice and formation of ni ru bimetallic particles the xrd patterns of the used catalysts are presented in fig 8 for the pure ni catalyst the nio peaks are significantly stronger and the ni peaks are weaker after use for scwg as shown in fig 8 a this result is consistent with the ni metal being oxidized during scwg fig 8 b compares ni80ru20 and ni60ru40 catalysts before and after scwg reactions no nio peaks can found in either used catalyst suggesting oxidation of ni can be suppressed by incorporating ru metal the small differences in both the ni and ru peaks between fresh and used catalysts suggests that the addition of ru improved the stability of the catalysts as well compared with the change in pure ni before and after scwg reactions elliott 2008 elliott et al 2006 we used h2 temperature programmed reduction h2 tpr to probe the reducibility or oxidation state of the active metals in the supported catalysts hossain et al 2017 myint et al 2016 with the aim to directly compare the reduction process of bimetallic ru ni with the monometallic catalysts we prepared monometallic ni and ru catalysts with the same synthesis method used for the bimetallic catalysts the h2 tpr results are shown in fig 9 the ru al2o3 catalyst shows peaks at 140 c 163 c and 200 c the two main peaks at the lower temperatures are associated with the reduction of ru oxide particles in different forms of interaction on the al2o3 surface valdes martinez et al 2017 hossain et al 2017 reported that the peak at 140 c is due to the reduction of well dispersed ruo2 species which have a weak interaction with the support liu et al 2008 the peak around 163 c represents the reduction of bulk ruo2 species which would have weak interactions with the catalyst support the last peak at 200 c is associated with the reduction of complex ruo2 with different forms of interaction with the al2o3 surface guczi et al 1986b for the ni al2o3 catalyst the only peak present is at 390 c and it corresponds to the reduction of bulk nio the bimetallic ni ru catalyst shows peaks at 170 c 190 c 270 c and 362 c the peaks at 170 c and 190 c can be related to the reduction of ruo2 whereas the peak at 362 c corresponds to the reduction of nio due to the metal interactions the reduction of easily reducible metal oxide may enhance the reduction of the other metal oxide so that both metal oxides may be reduced at the same time to form bimetallic particles rynkowski et al 1995b tada et al 2014 valdes martinez et al 2017 the sharp peak at 270 c is ascribed to the co reduction of nio and ruo2 present on the support surface which likely forms ni ru bimetallic particles hossain et al 2017 the tpr results for the ni ru catalyst indicates the existence of mixture of monometallic and bimetallic nanoparticles consistent with the tem eds and xrd results table s2 shows physical properties of the fresh and used catalysts on four different catalyst supports for all four supports the bet surface area pore volume average pore size and metal dispersion decreased after the 30 min scwg reaction at 450 c 4 conclusion incorporating ru in a ni catalyst promotes formation of cyclohexanol during the reaction of phenol in supercritical water this enhanced hydrogenation activity also promotes subsequent gasification reactions as saturated compounds are generally easier to gasify in supercritical water than are aromatics the ru20ni80 catalyst appears to offer good balance between gasification activity and cost i e ru content indeed dft calculations showed that a large decrease in the energy barrier for phenol hydrogenation occurred when going from a ni surface to ni3ru but a much smaller decrease accompanied the change from ni3ru to pure ru the catalyst supports tested have no significant effect on the reactions bet area pore volume average pore size and metal dispersion for all catalysts decrease after 30 min reaction in supercritical water ni ru and bimetallic particles are dispersed on the al2o3 support and the ru particles are evenly distributed amongst the ni particles the ni80ru20 al2o3 catalyst exhibits well defined ru 101 ru 100 and ni 111 facets declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or
