24030,over the last several decades various analytical numerical and experimental studies have reported that leading depression n type tsunamis could be more destructive than leading elevation n type tsunamis however in many analytical or experimental studies the effects of shelf geometry and wave breaking under the geophysical scale which are known to significantly affect tsunami evolution have been ignored therefore it is still unclear whether leading depression tsunamis always result in more serious damage than leading elevation tsunamis if earthquakes with the same magnitude occur at the same epicentre thus this study investigated the runup and wave evolution characteristics of idealized leading depression and leading elevation tsunamis particularly considering the effects of shelf geometry and wave breaking under the geophysical scale using a boussinesq type model for fully nonlinear weakly dispersive rotational and turbulent flow the evolution of tsunami was simulated and the energy and momentum of the tsunami were calculated as a result on steeply sloped bathymetry the large momentum and potential energy induced during the rundown process of the leading depression tsunami results in runup that was higher than that of the leading elevation tsunami which was consistent with the results of previous studies interestingly the leading depression tsunami resulted in a lower runup height on mild and long sloped bathymetry in contrast to previous studies this process originated from the energy dissipation caused by the wave breaking of the undular bore and the mass exchange occurring between the positive and negative waves 1 introduction the characteristics of travelling tsunamis have attracted public and scientific interest for over 50 years and many theoretical studies including laboratory experiments and numerical simulations have led to a better understanding of their characteristics associated with bathymetric variations nonetheless the gap between theoretical studies and field observations remains poorly constrained for example field observations have shown that the bathymetry of a long continental shelf with a mild slope can effectively prevent tsunamis in coastal areas e g ioualalen et al 2007 in contrast to this observation some theoretical studies have reported that nonbreaking tsunamis can transfer more energy to the shoreline and thus result in higher runup on mildly sloped bathymetry than on steeply sloped beds e g madsen and fuhrman 2008 one of the important factors directly linked to inundation is the incident profile of a tsunami wave tadepalli and synolakis 1994 cho and na 2015 although solitary cnoidal and n waves as the simplified form of real tsunami in nature have been among the most common profiles used to define the incident waveforms in theoretical studies for example madsen et al 2008 proposed that the first two symmetrical waveforms may be inappropriate for reproducing geophysical scale tsunamis although n wave is still different from the waveform of real tsunami in field the n wave yields a good approximation of the tsunami profile to the leading order tadepalli and synolakis 1996 madsen and schaffer 2010 drähne et al 2015 kriebel et al 2017 and is classified into two types the leading depression n wave ldn and the leading elevation n wave len as shown in fig 1 it is intuitively expected that an ldn approaching the shoreline will lead to a lower runup height than an len because the trough leading edge of the ldn will cause the shoreline to recede and descend several metres below the mean sea level before it starts to run up interestingly however empirical surveys at several field sites have revealed that ldn type tsunamis exhibit counterintuitive runup behaviours that may lead to catastrophic inundation damage tadepalli and synolakis 1994 although survey data shows the results of tsunamis it cannot explain yet the physical processes in detail why the ldn could induce the serious damage on the coasts in addition field surveys usually only report maximum runup height in local areas which can be seriously affected by local topography such as the shapes of banks bays berms hills ponds rivers and valley therefore although survey data is essential for tsunami study it is not easy to find a clear relationship between the wave profile and runup height using only field survey data analytical and numerical approaches have been utilized with some limitations resulted from simplifications to show the prescribed mismatch between our intuitions and field observations for example the coastal impacts of ldns and lens with the same amplitude can be compared using analytical or numerical methods without ambiguity tadepalli and synolakis 1994 1996 and madsen and schaffer 2010 analytically showed that the ldn could run up higher than the len on plain slopes liang et al 2013 and cho and na 2015 obtained the same results as these analytical studies using a boussinesq type model and a navier stokes equation model respectively however those tsunami runup tests were limited to relatively steep bathymetry conditions as presented in table 1 for example tadepalli and synolakis 1994 studied the runup height of a nonbreaking wave under the conditions of 1 35 s 1 10 where s is the bottom slope and charvet et al 2013 tested runup on a bathymetry with s 1 20 in addition some theoretical and numerical studies tadepalli and synolakis 1994 1996 liang et al 2013 cho and na 2015 have neglected the geophysical scale which has turned out to be another main factor controlling tsunami evolution madsen et al 2008 kim and son 2018 although madsen and schaffer 2010 and siva and behera 2016 considered tsunami evolution at the geophysical scale some important physical processes such as wave breaking and dispersion have often been ignored thus the runup characteristics of n type waves remain still unknown if more physical factors such as wave breaking and shelf geometry under the geophysical scale are considered simultaneously furthermore to the best of the authors knowledge no studies have provided the fundamental mechanism of how or why the ldn or len results in a relatively higher runup most studies have focused largely on the type of n wave resulting in higher runup and have paid relatively less attention to the physical insight into the processes occurring as a result although a few previous studies tadepalli and synolakis 1994 cho and na 2015 have conjectured that the steeper water surface gradient of the ldn observed during the rundown phase may induce higher runup the physical quantity associated with the water surface slope has been neither presented nor explained clearly in this study we examined the runup characteristics of simplified single ldn and len type tsunamis the main focus of the study lies in better understanding of geophysical scale bathymetric effects and wave breaking on the tsunami runup of single n type waveforms under the geophysical scale to simulate the tsunami from deep ocean area to runup a boussinesq type model for fully nonlinear weakly dispersive rotational and turbulent flow including the effects of wave breaking is used based on the computed results we provide a physical explanation of the previously unrecognized energy mass and momentum paradigms on the propagation and runup of the simplified single ldn and len type tsunamis on idealized bathymetry in nearshore areas 2 methods 2 1 flow model although analytical solutions are exact intuitive and simple it is not easy to use them to fully solve the problems associated with the nonlinearity dispersion shoaling fission breaking and runup of waves meanwhile physical experiments or field observations can provide real information about tsunami physics however because of the intermittent occurrence of tsunami events and the limited numbers of gauge installations tsunamis are rarely measured in the open ocean except at a few observation points in addition the ratio of the wave amplitude to water depth and the vertical h o to horizontal length scale l o are extremely small so it is impractical to model tsunamis in the laboratory without using a scale distortion as a result it is difficult to obtain a sufficient amount of accurate data from field observations or laboratory measurements and thus to elaborately and precisely analyse physical quantities using these measured data as an alternative numerical methods based on boussinesq type equations can be appropriate for studying tsunamis because boussinesq type models can simulate the evolution of a tsunami from its generation through coastal processes to its dissipation at the field scale nwogu 1993 madsen et al 2008 dutykh and dias 2009 kim and lynett 2011 kirby et al 2013 thus this study employs a boussinesq type model for fully nonlinear weakly dispersive rotational and turbulent flow including the breaking dissipation effect kim et al 2009 kim and lynett 2011 as follows 1 ζ t h u α x m m ν 0 2 h u α t h u α u α x gh ζ x h d d ν u α m m ν h x 2 ν t h u α x 2 h x ν t v u α x τ b ρ h r b 0 where x and t represent the spatial axis and time respectively u α is the horizontal flow velocity at an arbitrary level ζ is the water surface elevation and h is the total water depth ν t h and ν t v are the horizontal and vertical eddy viscosities respectively m m ν d and d ν are the high order dispersion vorticity correction and dispersion correction terms considering the wave and turbulence respectively τ b is the bottom shear stress which is estimated using the manning formula g is the gravitational acceleration and ρ is the water density r b is the wave breaking dissipation term the solutions of the governing equation can be obtained using a computational scheme for the time integration of the governing equation the third order accurate adams bashforth predictor scheme and the fourth order accurate adams moulton corrector scheme are used for the spatial reconstruction of the conserved quantities at the cell interfaces a fourth order accurate compact muscl tvd scheme is used and the flux at the interface is calculated using the hllc approximate riemann solver toro 2002 the numerical balance between the flux and bottom slope term is maintained using a revised surface gradient method kim et al 2008 this numerical model has been tested for various hydrodynamic problems at different spatial scales ranging from in laboratory experiments to oceanic site specific tsunami events in these tested problems this model has been shown to successfully reproduce various physical properties at different stages of tsunami evolution which involve the generation nearshore processes such as the shoaling fission secondary wave generation breaking rundown and runup of tsunamis lynett et al 2010 kim and lynett 2011 son et al 2011 more details about these equations and numerical methods have been described by kim et al 2009 and kim and lynett 2011 2 2 definition of the energy and momentum of a tsunami kim and son 2018 presented the depth integrated form of the momentum and energy of a tsunami under a long wave scale as follows 3 m o d ζ ρudz ρ ζ d u α μ 2 ρ 1 2 z α 2 ζ d 1 6 ζ 3 d 3 u αxx μ 2 ρ z α ζ d 1 2 ζ 2 d 2 du αxx o μ 4 4 e ϕ 0 ζ ρgzdz 1 2 ρg ζ 2 5 e

horizontal momentum e ϕ is the wave induced potential energy relative to the mean sea water level z 0 and e k is the wave induced kinetic energy d is the distance from the mean sea water level to the bottom elevation z is the vertical axis and the subscript x is the differential operator u 2 u 2 w 2 where u and w u x du x are the horizontal and vertical flow velocities respectively μ h o l o is the long wave scale parameter which is assumed to be o μ 2 1 more details about this derivation have been described by kim and son 2018 2 3 bathymetry and wave setup realistic modelling results can be obtained from tsunami simulations performed with real topography data e g ioualalen et al 2007 zhao et al 2013 the results computed using real topography data and their analysis are likely to involve complexity and uncertainty on the other hand although the use of simple geometry and wave conditions is inappropriate for reflecting some of the conditions of real environments the results obtained using them can be used to perform a clear and straightforward analysis from this perspective we use idealized wave and bathymetry conditions in this study and thus attempt to determine the fundamental relationship between tsunami evolution and bathymetry which has not yet been identified the reflection and transmission of geophysical scale tsunamis rely considerably on the slope and length of the bathymetry kim and son 2018 hence the test conditions in this study cover a wide range of bottom slopes which are determined based on the average slopes of the continental slope and the continental shelf as shown in table 1 another important factor that affects the transmissive property of a tsunami is secondary wave breaking which is also dependent on the bottom slope kim and son 2018 in preliminary numerical tests the tsunami wave fission and its breaking originating from the development of a secondary wave are not observed when the tsunami wave propagates to the shoreline and runs up over a bathymetry of s 1 150 results consistent with this observation were reported by madsen et al 2008 and kim and son 2018 this indicates that when s 1 150 the tsunami profile from the deep ocean to a coastal area is very long and smooth and a relatively large computational grid can be used for its numerical simulation on relatively mild slopes i e s 1 200 a secondary wave can be developed and the breaking of the secondary wave can significantly attenuate the tsunami that is the wave length becomes relatively short thus a small computational grid should be used to adequately resolve the wave evolution processes in addition the results of this preliminary test and kim and son 2018 have both indicated that wave fission and the subsequent undular bore development occur only at shallow water depths d 200 m in accordance with the observations obtained from the preliminary simulations and references noted above we set up three geometry groups as shown in fig 2 and table 2 relatively steep bathymetry sb representing a continental slope relatively gentle bathymetry gb representing a continental shelf preceded by a continental slope and shallow steep bathymetry ss composing representing relatively steep bathymetry in a shallow water region preceded by a continental slope sb and gb are designed to include the average slopes of the continental slopes and continental shelves observed in nature ss is additionally defined to check the consistency and continuity of the results obtained from gb and sb and valid simulation results are confirmed as presented in a later section as shown in fig 2 a sb comprises a deep flat bottom of d 4000 m and a single plain slope of s 1 5 1 200 gb in fig 2 b comprises a deep flat bottom of d 4000 m and two connected plain slopes representing a continental slope and a continental shelf where the s of the continental slope area of gb is given as 1 15 based on the average value of the continental slopes observed in nature and s 1 200 1 1000 is adopted for the continental shelf area the water depth at the edge of the continental shelf is fixed as d 200 m the ss shown in fig 2 b is the same as that in gb but includes a relatively steep slope s 1 5 1 200 in an area of shallow water depth d 200 m for the numerical simulations in the sb case a computational grid size of x 100 m is used while a much finer grid size of x 10 m is applied to those in the gb and ss cases to capture the undular bore that may occur in the shallow water region the computational time step t is determined using a cfl condition i e t cfl min x u gh where cfl 0 5 regarding the simplification of tsunami wave into n type waveform we followed the finding from previous works that a n type waveform as representative of tsunami captures the essential nature of a tsunami runup to the leading order e g tadepalli and synolakis 1996 carrier et al 2003 madsen and schaffer 2010 drähne et al 2015 kriebel et al 2017 thus the incident single n wave is generated by the following equation 6 ζ i a o sech 2 2 πt t w 2 x x e l w μ a o sech 2 2 πt t w 2 x x d l w where a o is the wave amplitude t w is the wave period and l w is the wave length μ is given by μ 0 1 3 2 3 1 x e and x d which represent the spatial locations of elevation and depression humps are given by x x e l w π 8 and x x d l w π 8 respectively to enhance the generality of the results we simulate with another incident wave profile i e a single period sinusoidal wave as follows 7 ζ i a o sin 2 πt t w 0 t t w 0 otherwise considering the geophysical scale observed in the field an incident wave period and the amplitude of the positive wave are set to be 780 s and 1 m respectively madsen et al 2008 at the deep sea area of d 4000 m 3 results the simulation results are given in this section in particular the relationships between specific tsunami properties and bathymetric features such as the tsunami runup heights versus bottom slopes are assessed and analysed in the following subsections figs 3 and 4 show the computed runup height rh results with various μ and the single periodic sinusoidal cases where the rhs on both sb and ss are similar but that on gb is different thus we analyse and present the results computed for sb and gb in the following section 3 1 runup height patterns on steep and gentle slopes fig 3 shows the variations in the simulated rhs of ldn and len with respect to the bottom slope when s 1 100 the rhs continue to increase as s 1 increases namely as s decreases this tendency is consistent with those observed in the previous studies listed in table 1 on the other hand when s 1 100 which is beyond the range of s values considered in previous studies the observed rhs are proportional to s m rather than s m where m is a negative real number interestingly this warped tendency of the rhs around s 1 100 is found in both the ldn and len cases therefore the well known knowledge discovered from the previous analytical and numerical studies indicating that rhs increase as s decreases must be applied carefully based on the specific range of s values 3 2 intercomparison of rhs between ldn and len the characteristics of rhs depending on the type of n wave are also of interest in the present study and are thus analysed in this section fig 3 compares the rhs of the ldn and len which reveals that in relatively steep bathymetry the ldn results in higher rhs than the len which is consistent with previous studies however when s 1 200 the rhs of the ldn become lower than those of the len in contrast to conventional studies one of the main reasons for such a reversal between the rhs of the ldn and len found around s 1 200 is the secondary wave breaking occurring on long and mild slopes in shallow water areas kim and son 2018 in the tested cases a tiny bore begins to occur for the ldn at s 1 150 and for the len at s 1 200 and the height of the secondary wave is observed to increase as s decreases fig 5 illustrates the largest secondary wave height observed under each bathymetry condition and the distance between the wave breaking point and the shoreline where we can see that the ldn produces a larger secondary wave height farther offshore from the shoreline than the len under the same bathymetry conditions in other words the ldns are more likely to break than the lens and the ldns can thus dissipate more energy over a longer travel distance at least under the tested conditions more details about this process are described in the discussion section fig 4 shows the rh variations for the n type wave parameter μ on the gb and ss for the len cases the effect of μ was negligible on the other hand the change of μ significantly affected the rhs of the ldn cases thus we can infer that the shape of the trough of the n type wave following the leading crest has little effects on the runup processes but the shape of the trough leading the crest plays an important role for the runup processes more details for the role of the leading trough of the n type wave are presented in the discussion section 4 discussion to thoroughly explain the physical mechanism of n wave runup the profiles of the relative water surface elevation ζ ζ i relative momentum m o m oi relative potential e ϕ e ϕi and kinetic energy e k e ki of the ldn and len with μ 1 0 are plotted in figs 6 through 9 where the subscript i refers to the corresponding quantity at the wave crest when the incident wave front reaches the toe of the continental slope in these plots onshore directed flows momentums and fluxes are defined as positive for the descriptive analysis considering the average slopes of continental slopes s 1 15 and continental shelves s 1 570 in nature encyclopedia britannica the results and their descriptive analyses for the two cases of s 1 15 and 1 600 are presented in this section 4 1 momentum paradigm on sb to examine how the momentum defined by eq 3 develops on steep bathymetry with s 1 15 the profiles of the water surface and momentum of a tsunami calculated by the boussinesq type model are plotted in fig 6 a1 a2 b1 and b2 as shown in these figures the runup process of the len can be described in detail as follows first as the positive wave described in fig 1 front of the len approaches the shoreline the positive wave height and length become larger and shorter respectively due to shoaling as shown by line 3 in fig 6 a1 then the positive wave begins to run up due to its onshore directed momentum and kinetic energy as illustrated by line 3 until it finally reaches its maximum runup as shown by line 4 in fig 6 a in contrast to the len the ldn shows more complex processes until maximum runup occurs because it includes not only runup but also rundown processes as shown in fig 6 b1 because the negative wave described in fig 1 of the ldn preceding it arrives at the shoreline first the rundown process takes place ahead of runup as depicted by lines 1 and 2 in fig 6 b1 at that moment the flow direction of the negative wave 1 is directed offshore thus the amount of water in the control volume depicted in fig 1 under the negative wave 1 moves offshore which can also be inferred from fig 6 b1 and b2 on the shoreline side no water supply into the control volume occurs under the negative wave because the land is dry therefore the rundown process of the ldn occurs under the combined condition of the offshore directed momentum or flow direction under the negative wave and the zero mass flux from the beach as shown in fig 4 deeper trough indicates lower rundown the rhs of the ldn increases as μ increases on the steep slopes of the tested cases after the flow direction of the rundown area reverses to onshore the runup process begins which is identical to that of the len the sequential profiles of waves from 1 to 5 in fig 7 show that the maximum m o m oi of the len steadily decreases as it approaches the shoreline and runs up on the other hand the maximum m o m oi of the ldn at each step does not decrease but is sustained this results from the large gravity force induced from the steeper ζ x of the preceding rundown phase tadepalli and synolakis 1994 cho and na 2015 finally this amplified momentum of the ldn causes the runup of this wave to be higher than that of the len 4 2 energy paradigm on sb fig 6 also shows the relative potential and kinetic energy values calculated using eqs 4 and 5 respectively to clearly describe wave induced potential energy two different bases are defined first the mean sea level z 0 is conveniently defined as the basis for the calculation under which the wave induced potential energy is zero under the condition of no waves second during the runup process we can define the basis as the lowest position between the shoreline and the leading wave for example during the len runup the blue point where the elevation is z 0 in fig 6 a1 can be used as the basis for the calculation of wave induced potential energy because it represents the lowest water level between the positive wave and the shoreline level before shoreline recession occurs on the other hand the shoreline retreats during the rundown of the ldn thus the lowest elevation point between the leading wave and the shoreline i e the basis of the potential energy moves from z 0 to the red point in fig 6 b1 as a result the potential energy based on the red point becomes much larger as seen when comparing line 2 to line 2 in turn some of this amplified potential energy transforms into kinetic energy and the kinetic energy increases near the shoreline as seen in line 3 in fig 6 b4 consequently the amplified kinetic energy i e that seen in line 3 in fig 6 b4 has the capacity to push the water higher up on land because the len skips the rundown step unlike the ldn the magnitude of the kinetic energy of the len as seen in line 3 in fig 6 a4 is much smaller than that of the ldn in summary the amplification of potential energy due to the decreasing reference basis during the rundown phase and its conversion to kinetic energy result in the high rh of the ldn on steep slopes similar to the momentum paradigm noted above the rhs of the ldn are proportional to μ on the steep slopes as shown in fig 4 4 3 energy paradigm on gb while an n wave is propagating on a slope the wave becomes steeper because its celerity changes with variations in water depth at the same time the curvature of the wave profile sharpens and alters its sign which induces horizontal pressure gradients soares frazao 2002 kim and lynett 2011 and eventually creates a secondary wave fig 8 captures the profiles of the ldn and len at the instant when a secondary wave begins to be generated on the main wave of the positive waves in the given spatial range of fig 8 b the magnitudes of curvature of the ldn are approximately 10 100 times larger than those of the len as a result a secondary wave appears on the ldn but not on the len even though both positive waves are at the same location this also implies that the len may generate a secondary wave after it travels further to the shoreline therefore an undular bore can occur farther from the shoreline on the ldn than on the len as shown in fig 8 a and b which means that the ldn is more likely to develop a higher and shorter secondary wave until it breaks down a higher and shorter wave represents a condition that is prone to collapsing for the given cases in fig 9 the calculated distances from the breaking points to the shoreline of the ldn and len are approximately 17 km and 11 km respectively accordingly more of the energy of the ldn will likely be dissipated by breaking over a longer travelling distance than that of the len with the same incident wave height and period finally when the positive wave front of the ldn arrives at the beach as represented by line 3 in fig 9 the magnitudes of the relative potential and kinetic energy will become weaker than those of the len this entire process is clearly described in fig 9 a3 a4 b3 and b4 in addition larger μ also indicates more chance to develop a higher and shorter secondary wave than smaller μ thus the rhs of the ldn is inversely proportional to μ on the mild slopes due to the wave breaking as shown in fig 4 4 4 momentum paradigm on gb fig 9 a2 and b2 show the momentum of the n wave on the gb calculated by eq 3 as shown in this figure the paradigms of the momentum before and after the onset of wave breaking are clearly different before the positive wave front reaches the breaking point the momentum shows an oscillating pattern due to the secondary wave as shown in line 1 after the positive wave front passes the breaking point as shown in lines 2 4 the magnitude of momentum significantly decreases because the breaking attenuates the secondary wave height and flow velocity appeared in the leading order terms of eq 3 consequently when the positive fronts of the n wave arrive at the shoreline the momentums on the gb decrease greatly in comparison with that of the n wave on the sb in fig 6 where secondary wave breaking is not observed as described in the above section the ldn can exhibit higher runup than the len on steep slopes due to the large depression of the water surface that occurs during the rundown phase which later induces strong onshore directed momentum due to the steeper ζ x however on gb the breaking induced attenuation considerably weakens the offshore directed momentum of the ldn during the rundown phase thus this weak momentum results in a small decrease in the water surface during rundown in turn the weak onshore directed momentum generated by a relatively gentle water surface gradient will eventually produce a smaller runup height than that of the len on gb 4 5 mass flux paradigm on the sb and gb the depth averaged horizontal velocity at the location where ζ 0 i e aa in fig 10 or the interface between positive and negative waves is not always zero on an uneven bottom thus mass or volume exchange occurs between the control volumes depicted in fig 1 of the positive and negative waves at that location kim and son 2018 throughout all of the tested len cases it was found that the horizontal velocity at aa is directed offshore and thus the water in the control volume of the positive wave moves through aa to the control volume of the negative wave as shown in fig 10 a kim and son 2018 on the other hand for all of the ldn cases simulated in this study the flow direction at aa is directed onshore and thus the water in the control volume of the positive wave moves to the control volume of the negative wave through aa as shown in fig 10 b therefore the void area surrounded by the negative wave profile and mean sea level ζ 0 is gradually filled with the water released from the control volume of the positive wave when the waves approach the shoreline regardless of whether they are the ldn or len this process explains why and how the wave profile of the n wave becomes flattened and closer to the mean sea level as it approaches the shoreline separately to the wave breaking or wave bathymetry interactions the accumulated volume flux through aa is proportional to the travel time from the slope toe to the shoreline on a plain slope the travel time of a tsunami from the slope toe to the shoreline is given as t c 2 s h s g where h s is the water depth of the slope toe kim and son 2018 thus it is evident that a greater mass or volume of water in the control volume of the positive wave moves to the control volume of the negative wave on a mildly sloped bathymetry than it does on a steeply sloped bathymetry therefore the volume of the positive wave when it reaches the shoreline becomes very small if s is very small the examples in figs 6 and 9 show that when the positive waves of s 1 15 arrive at the shoreline the water volume above the mean sea level is much larger than that when s 1 600 it is important to mention that the wave height reduction caused by the mass transport through aa should be distinguished from that caused by the wave breaking 5 conclusion in this study the runup of simplified n type tsunamis and their physical characteristics were investigated considering geophysical scale bathymetry and wave breaking idealized conditions were adopted for the incident wave and bathymetry to determine the fundamental relationships between the geometric features of incident wave and bathymetry and the runup characteristics to obtain accurate tsunami simulations higher order effects such as wave dispersion and breaking were included because they are considered the major factors affecting the evolution and runup of a tsunami the momentum and energy of the ldn and len type tsunamis were estimated using the depth integrated eqs 3 5 based on long wave scales the major findings obtained from the simulation results under the simplified wave and bathymetry conditions considering geophysical scale and their analysis are summarized as follows 1 under the geophysical scale the rhs of the n waves are proportional to s 1 and s on relatively steep and mild slopes the former result is consistent with those obtained from previous studies but the latter result contrasts with those of previous studies 2 on the steeply sloped bathymetry the rh of the ldn is higher than that of the len however the rh of the ldn is lower than that of the len on the mildly sloped bathymetry which was not explained by previous studies 3 the descending water surface during the rundown process amplifies the onshore directed momentum and potential energy which is then transformed into kinetic energy thus the ldn induces a higher rh than the len on steeply sloped bathymetry 4 on mildly sloped bathymetry a secondary wave forms on the main wave and then breaks down which significantly dissipates the potential and kinetic energy necessary for runup this process is more active in the ldn than in the len thus the ldn is likely to lose more energy and momentum than the len 5 on sloped bathymetry the negative wave gains the water released from the positive wave through the interface between the negative and positive waves aa in fig 10 because it takes longer for a tsunami to travel on mildly sloped bathymetry the accumulated flux can be sufficiently large to make the water surface flatter over a longer distance thus a relatively small wave height and volume will remain when a tsunami arrives at the shoreline across a very long and mildly sloped bathymetry such as a continental shelf the limitations of the proposed conclusions are clear the use of idealized bathymetry and incident waves unlike real field conditions and limited cases of initial wave profiles many factors contributing to the two dimensional evolution of a tsunami such as refraction and diffraction were not considered in addition many key geophysical processes were completely neglected including the actual generation of the tsunamis through a complex rupture process among many others lastly although n waves are a more appropriate model for a tsunami wave than solitary wave or others they are still very different from the waveform of real tsunami in field therefore the specific numbers proposed in the results and discussion may not be an absolute criterion however although there are still many uncertainties to overcome the simple but well defined concept proposed in this study can be used to help analyse complex computational results and observation data in real fields the following is the supplementary data related to this article fig s1 profiles of relative ζ m o e ϕ and e k of a ldn and b len on gentle bathymetry s 1 600 μ 1 numbers indicate the timing of the following events 1

24030,over the last several decades various analytical numerical and experimental studies have reported that leading depression n type tsunamis could be more destructive than leading elevation n type tsunamis however in many analytical or experimental studies the effects of shelf geometry and wave breaking under the geophysical scale which are known to significantly affect tsunami evolution have been ignored therefore it is still unclear whether leading depression tsunamis always result in more serious damage than leading elevation tsunamis if earthquakes with the same magnitude occur at the same epicentre thus this study investigated the runup and wave evolution characteristics of idealized leading depression and leading elevation tsunamis particularly considering the effects of shelf geometry and wave breaking under the geophysical scale using a boussinesq type model for fully nonlinear weakly dispersive rotational and turbulent flow the evolution of tsunami was simulated and the energy and momentum of the tsunami were calculated as a result on steeply sloped bathymetry the large momentum and potential energy induced during the rundown process of the leading depression tsunami results in runup that was higher than that of the leading elevation tsunami which was consistent with the results of previous studies interestingly the leading depression tsunami resulted in a lower runup height on mild and long sloped bathymetry in contrast to previous studies this process originated from the energy dissipation caused by the wave breaking of the undular bore and the mass exchange occurring between the positive and negative waves 1 introduction the characteristics of travelling tsunamis have attracted public and scientific interest for over 50 years and many theoretical studies including laboratory experiments and numerical simulations have led to a better understanding of their characteristics associated with bathymetric variations nonetheless the gap between theoretical studies and field observations remains poorly constrained for example field observations have shown that the bathymetry of a long continental shelf with a mild slope can effectively prevent tsunamis in coastal areas e g ioualalen et al 2007 in contrast to this observation some theoretical studies have reported that nonbreaking tsunamis can transfer more energy to the shoreline and thus result in higher runup on mildly sloped bathymetry than on steeply sloped beds e g madsen and fuhrman 2008 one of the important factors directly linked to inundation is the incident profile of a tsunami wave tadepalli and synolakis 1994 cho and na 2015 although solitary cnoidal and n waves as the simplified form of real tsunami in nature have been among the most common profiles used to define the incident waveforms in theoretical studies for example madsen et al 2008 proposed that the first two symmetrical waveforms may be inappropriate for reproducing geophysical scale tsunamis although n wave is still different from the waveform of real tsunami in field the n wave yields a good approximation of the tsunami profile to the leading order tadepalli and synolakis 1996 madsen and schaffer 2010 drähne et al 2015 kriebel et al 2017 and is classified into two types the leading depression n wave ldn and the leading elevation n wave len as shown in fig 1 it is intuitively expected that an ldn approaching the shoreline will lead to a lower runup height than an len because the trough leading edge of the ldn will cause the shoreline to recede and descend several metres below the mean sea level before it starts to run up interestingly however empirical surveys at several field sites have revealed that ldn type tsunamis exhibit counterintuitive runup behaviours that may lead to catastrophic inundation damage tadepalli and synolakis 1994 although survey data shows the results of tsunamis it cannot explain yet the physical processes in detail why the ldn could induce the serious damage on the coasts in addition field surveys usually only report maximum runup height in local areas which can be seriously affected by local topography such as the shapes of banks bays berms hills ponds rivers and valley therefore although survey data is essential for tsunami study it is not easy to find a clear relationship between the wave profile and runup height using only field survey data analytical and numerical approaches have been utilized with some limitations resulted from simplifications to show the prescribed mismatch between our intuitions and field observations for example the coastal impacts of ldns and lens with the same amplitude can be compared using analytical or numerical methods without ambiguity tadepalli and synolakis 1994 1996 and madsen and schaffer 2010 analytically showed that the ldn could run up higher than the len on plain slopes liang et al 2013 and cho and na 2015 obtained the same results as these analytical studies using a boussinesq type model and a navier stokes equation model respectively however those tsunami runup tests were limited to relatively steep bathymetry conditions as presented in table 1 for example tadepalli and synolakis 1994 studied the runup height of a nonbreaking wave under the conditions of 1 35 s 1 10 where s is the bottom slope and charvet et al 2013 tested runup on a bathymetry with s 1 20 in addition some theoretical and numerical studies tadepalli and synolakis 1994 1996 liang et al 2013 cho and na 2015 have neglected the geophysical scale which has turned out to be another main factor controlling tsunami evolution madsen et al 2008 kim and son 2018 although madsen and schaffer 2010 and siva and behera 2016 considered tsunami evolution at the geophysical scale some important physical processes such as wave breaking and dispersion have often been ignored thus the runup characteristics of n type waves remain still unknown if more physical factors such as wave breaking and shelf geometry under the geophysical scale are considered simultaneously furthermore to the best of the authors knowledge no studies have provided the fundamental mechanism of how or why the ldn or len results in a relatively higher runup most studies have focused largely on the type of n wave resulting in higher runup and have paid relatively less attention to the physical insight into the processes occurring as a result although a few previous studies tadepalli and synolakis 1994 cho and na 2015 have conjectured that the steeper water surface gradient of the ldn observed during the rundown phase may induce higher runup the physical quantity associated with the water surface slope has been neither presented nor explained clearly in this study we examined the runup characteristics of simplified single ldn and len type tsunamis the main focus of the study lies in better understanding of geophysical scale bathymetric effects and wave breaking on the tsunami runup of single n type waveforms under the geophysical scale to simulate the tsunami from deep ocean area to runup a boussinesq type model for fully nonlinear weakly dispersive rotational and turbulent flow including the effects of wave breaking is used based on the computed results we provide a physical explanation of the previously unrecognized energy mass and momentum paradigms on the propagation and runup of the simplified single ldn and len type tsunamis on idealized bathymetry in nearshore areas 2 methods 2 1 flow model although analytical solutions are exact intuitive and simple it is not easy to use them to fully solve the problems associated with the nonlinearity dispersion shoaling fission breaking and runup of waves meanwhile physical experiments or field observations can provide real information about tsunami physics however because of the intermittent occurrence of tsunami events and the limited numbers of gauge installations tsunamis are rarely measured in the open ocean except at a few observation points in addition the ratio of the wave amplitude to water depth and the vertical h o to horizontal length scale l o are extremely small so it is impractical to model tsunamis in the laboratory without using a scale distortion as a result it is difficult to obtain a sufficient amount of accurate data from field observations or laboratory measurements and thus to elaborately and precisely analyse physical quantities using these measured data as an alternative numerical methods based on boussinesq type equations can be appropriate for studying tsunamis because boussinesq type models can simulate the evolution of a tsunami from its generation through coastal processes to its dissipation at the field scale nwogu 1993 madsen et al 2008 dutykh and dias 2009 kim and lynett 2011 kirby et al 2013 thus this study employs a boussinesq type model for fully nonlinear weakly dispersive rotational and turbulent flow including the breaking dissipation effect kim et al 2009 kim and lynett 2011 as follows 1 ζ t h u α x m m ν 0 2 h u α t h u α u α x gh ζ x h d d ν u α m m ν h x 2 ν t h u α x 2 h x ν t v u α x τ b ρ h r b 0 where x and t represent the spatial axis and time respectively u α is the horizontal flow velocity at an arbitrary level ζ is the water surface elevation and h is the total water depth ν t h and ν t v are the horizontal and vertical eddy viscosities respectively m m ν d and d ν are the high order dispersion vorticity correction and dispersion correction terms considering the wave and turbulence respectively τ b is the bottom shear stress which is estimated using the manning formula g is the gravitational acceleration and ρ is the water density r b is the wave breaking dissipation term the solutions of the governing equation can be obtained using a computational scheme for the time integration of the governing equation the third order accurate adams bashforth predictor scheme and the fourth order accurate adams moulton corrector scheme are used for the spatial reconstruction of the conserved quantities at the cell interfaces a fourth order accurate compact muscl tvd scheme is used and the flux at the interface is calculated using the hllc approximate riemann solver toro 2002 the numerical balance between the flux and bottom slope term is maintained using a revised surface gradient method kim et al 2008 this numerical model has been tested for various hydrodynamic problems at different spatial scales ranging from in laboratory experiments to oceanic site specific tsunami events in these tested problems this model has been shown to successfully reproduce various physical properties at different stages of tsunami evolution which involve the generation nearshore processes such as the shoaling fission secondary wave generation breaking rundown and runup of tsunamis lynett et al 2010 kim and lynett 2011 son et al 2011 more details about these equations and numerical methods have been described by kim et al 2009 and kim and lynett 2011 2 2 definition of the energy and momentum of a tsunami kim and son 2018 presented the depth integrated form of the momentum and energy of a tsunami under a long wave scale as follows 3 m o d ζ ρudz ρ ζ d u α μ 2 ρ 1 2 z α 2 ζ d 1 6 ζ 3 d 3 u αxx μ 2 ρ z α ζ d 1 2 ζ 2 d 2 du αxx o μ 4 4 e ϕ 0 ζ ρgzdz 1 2 ρg ζ 2 5 e

horizontal momentum e ϕ is the wave induced potential energy relative to the mean sea water level z 0 and e k is the wave induced kinetic energy d is the distance from the mean sea water level to the bottom elevation z is the vertical axis and the subscript x is the differential operator u 2 u 2 w 2 where u and w u x du x are the horizontal and vertical flow velocities respectively μ h o l o is the long wave scale parameter which is assumed to be o μ 2 1 more details about this derivation have been described by kim and son 2018 2 3 bathymetry and wave setup realistic modelling results can be obtained from tsunami simulations performed with real topography data e g ioualalen et al 2007 zhao et al 2013 the results computed using real topography data and their analysis are likely to involve complexity and uncertainty on the other hand although the use of simple geometry and wave conditions is inappropriate for reflecting some of the conditions of real environments the results obtained using them can be used to perform a clear and straightforward analysis from this perspective we use idealized wave and bathymetry conditions in this study and thus attempt to determine the fundamental relationship between tsunami evolution and bathymetry which has not yet been identified the reflection and transmission of geophysical scale tsunamis rely considerably on the slope and length of the bathymetry kim and son 2018 hence the test conditions in this study cover a wide range of bottom slopes which are determined based on the average slopes of the continental slope and the continental shelf as shown in table 1 another important factor that affects the transmissive property of a tsunami is secondary wave breaking which is also dependent on the bottom slope kim and son 2018 in preliminary numerical tests the tsunami wave fission and its breaking originating from the development of a secondary wave are not observed when the tsunami wave propagates to the shoreline and runs up over a bathymetry of s 1 150 results consistent with this observation were reported by madsen et al 2008 and kim and son 2018 this indicates that when s 1 150 the tsunami profile from the deep ocean to a coastal area is very long and smooth and a relatively large computational grid can be used for its numerical simulation on relatively mild slopes i e s 1 200 a secondary wave can be developed and the breaking of the secondary wave can significantly attenuate the tsunami that is the wave length becomes relatively short thus a small computational grid should be used to adequately resolve the wave evolution processes in addition the results of this preliminary test and kim and son 2018 have both indicated that wave fission and the subsequent undular bore development occur only at shallow water depths d 200 m in accordance with the observations obtained from the preliminary simulations and references noted above we set up three geometry groups as shown in fig 2 and table 2 relatively steep bathymetry sb representing a continental slope relatively gentle bathymetry gb representing a continental shelf preceded by a continental slope and shallow steep bathymetry ss composing representing relatively steep bathymetry in a shallow water region preceded by a continental slope sb and gb are designed to include the average slopes of the continental slopes and continental shelves observed in nature ss is additionally defined to check the consistency and continuity of the results obtained from gb and sb and valid simulation results are confirmed as presented in a later section as shown in fig 2 a sb comprises a deep flat bottom of d 4000 m and a single plain slope of s 1 5 1 200 gb in fig 2 b comprises a deep flat bottom of d 4000 m and two connected plain slopes representing a continental slope and a continental shelf where the s of the continental slope area of gb is given as 1 15 based on the average value of the continental slopes observed in nature and s 1 200 1 1000 is adopted for the continental shelf area the water depth at the edge of the continental shelf is fixed as d 200 m the ss shown in fig 2 b is the same as that in gb but includes a relatively steep slope s 1 5 1 200 in an area of shallow water depth d 200 m for the numerical simulations in the sb case a computational grid size of x 100 m is used while a much finer grid size of x 10 m is applied to those in the gb and ss cases to capture the undular bore that may occur in the shallow water region the computational time step t is determined using a cfl condition i e t cfl min x u gh where cfl 0 5 regarding the simplification of tsunami wave into n type waveform we followed the finding from previous works that a n type waveform as representative of tsunami captures the essential nature of a tsunami runup to the leading order e g tadepalli and synolakis 1996 carrier et al 2003 madsen and schaffer 2010 drähne et al 2015 kriebel et al 2017 thus the incident single n wave is generated by the following equation 6 ζ i a o sech 2 2 πt t w 2 x x e l w μ a o sech 2 2 πt t w 2 x x d l w where a o is the wave amplitude t w is the wave period and l w is the wave length μ is given by μ 0 1 3 2 3 1 x e and x d which represent the spatial locations of elevation and depression humps are given by x x e l w π 8 and x x d l w π 8 respectively to enhance the generality of the results we simulate with another incident wave profile i e a single period sinusoidal wave as follows 7 ζ i a o sin 2 πt t w 0 t t w 0 otherwise considering the geophysical scale observed in the field an incident wave period and the amplitude of the positive wave are set to be 780 s and 1 m respectively madsen et al 2008 at the deep sea area of d 4000 m 3 results the simulation results are given in this section in particular the relationships between specific tsunami properties and bathymetric features such as the tsunami runup heights versus bottom slopes are assessed and analysed in the following subsections figs 3 and 4 show the computed runup height rh results with various μ and the single periodic sinusoidal cases where the rhs on both sb and ss are similar but that on gb is different thus we analyse and present the results computed for sb and gb in the following section 3 1 runup height patterns on steep and gentle slopes fig 3 shows the variations in the simulated rhs of ldn and len with respect to the bottom slope when s 1 100 the rhs continue to increase as s 1 increases namely as s decreases this tendency is consistent with those observed in the previous studies listed in table 1 on the other hand when s 1 100 which is beyond the range of s values considered in previous studies the observed rhs are proportional to s m rather than s m where m is a negative real number interestingly this warped tendency of the rhs around s 1 100 is found in both the ldn and len cases therefore the well known knowledge discovered from the previous analytical and numerical studies indicating that rhs increase as s decreases must be applied carefully based on the specific range of s values 3 2 intercomparison of rhs between ldn and len the characteristics of rhs depending on the type of n wave are also of interest in the present study and are thus analysed in this section fig 3 compares the rhs of the ldn and len which reveals that in relatively steep bathymetry the ldn results in higher rhs than the len which is consistent with previous studies however when s 1 200 the rhs of the ldn become lower than those of the len in contrast to conventional studies one of the main reasons for such a reversal between the rhs of the ldn and len found around s 1 200 is the secondary wave breaking occurring on long and mild slopes in shallow water areas kim and son 2018 in the tested cases a tiny bore begins to occur for the ldn at s 1 150 and for the len at s 1 200 and the height of the secondary wave is observed to increase as s decreases fig 5 illustrates the largest secondary wave height observed under each bathymetry condition and the distance between the wave breaking point and the shoreline where we can see that the ldn produces a larger secondary wave height farther offshore from the shoreline than the len under the same bathymetry conditions in other words the ldns are more likely to break than the lens and the ldns can thus dissipate more energy over a longer travel distance at least under the tested conditions more details about this process are described in the discussion section fig 4 shows the rh variations for the n type wave parameter μ on the gb and ss for the len cases the effect of μ was negligible on the other hand the change of μ significantly affected the rhs of the ldn cases thus we can infer that the shape of the trough of the n type wave following the leading crest has little effects on the runup processes but the shape of the trough leading the crest plays an important role for the runup processes more details for the role of the leading trough of the n type wave are presented in the discussion section 4 discussion to thoroughly explain the physical mechanism of n wave runup the profiles of the relative water surface elevation ζ ζ i relative momentum m o m oi relative potential e ϕ e ϕi and kinetic energy e k e ki of the ldn and len with μ 1 0 are plotted in figs 6 through 9 where the subscript i refers to the corresponding quantity at the wave crest when the incident wave front reaches the toe of the continental slope in these plots onshore directed flows momentums and fluxes are defined as positive for the descriptive analysis considering the average slopes of continental slopes s 1 15 and continental shelves s 1 570 in nature encyclopedia britannica the results and their descriptive analyses for the two cases of s 1 15 and 1 600 are presented in this section 4 1 momentum paradigm on sb to examine how the momentum defined by eq 3 develops on steep bathymetry with s 1 15 the profiles of the water surface and momentum of a tsunami calculated by the boussinesq type model are plotted in fig 6 a1 a2 b1 and b2 as shown in these figures the runup process of the len can be described in detail as follows first as the positive wave described in fig 1 front of the len approaches the shoreline the positive wave height and length become larger and shorter respectively due to shoaling as shown by line 3 in fig 6 a1 then the positive wave begins to run up due to its onshore directed momentum and kinetic energy as illustrated by line 3 until it finally reaches its maximum runup as shown by line 4 in fig 6 a in contrast to the len the ldn shows more complex processes until maximum runup occurs because it includes not only runup but also rundown processes as shown in fig 6 b1 because the negative wave described in fig 1 of the ldn preceding it arrives at the shoreline first the rundown process takes place ahead of runup as depicted by lines 1 and 2 in fig 6 b1 at that moment the flow direction of the negative wave 1 is directed offshore thus the amount of water in the control volume depicted in fig 1 under the negative wave 1 moves offshore which can also be inferred from fig 6 b1 and b2 on the shoreline side no water supply into the control volume occurs under the negative wave because the land is dry therefore the rundown process of the ldn occurs under the combined condition of the offshore directed momentum or flow direction under the negative wave and the zero mass flux from the beach as shown in fig 4 deeper trough indicates lower rundown the rhs of the ldn increases as μ increases on the steep slopes of the tested cases after the flow direction of the rundown area reverses to onshore the runup process begins which is identical to that of the len the sequential profiles of waves from 1 to 5 in fig 7 show that the maximum m o m oi of the len steadily decreases as it approaches the shoreline and runs up on the other hand the maximum m o m oi of the ldn at each step does not decrease but is sustained this results from the large gravity force induced from the steeper ζ x of the preceding rundown phase tadepalli and synolakis 1994 cho and na 2015 finally this amplified momentum of the ldn causes the runup of this wave to be higher than that of the len 4 2 energy paradigm on sb fig 6 also shows the relative potential and kinetic energy values calculated using eqs 4 and 5 respectively to clearly describe wave induced potential energy two different bases are defined first the mean sea level z 0 is conveniently defined as the basis for the calculation under which the wave induced potential energy is zero under the condition of no waves second during the runup process we can define the basis as the lowest position between the shoreline and the leading wave for example during the len runup the blue point where the elevation is z 0 in fig 6 a1 can be used as the basis for the calculation of wave induced potential energy because it represents the lowest water level between the positive wave and the shoreline level before shoreline recession occurs on the other hand the shoreline retreats during the rundown of the ldn thus the lowest elevation point between the leading wave and the shoreline i e the basis of the potential energy moves from z 0 to the red point in fig 6 b1 as a result the potential energy based on the red point becomes much larger as seen when comparing line 2 to line 2 in turn some of this amplified potential energy transforms into kinetic energy and the kinetic energy increases near the shoreline as seen in line 3 in fig 6 b4 consequently the amplified kinetic energy i e that seen in line 3 in fig 6 b4 has the capacity to push the water higher up on land because the len skips the rundown step unlike the ldn the magnitude of the kinetic energy of the len as seen in line 3 in fig 6 a4 is much smaller than that of the ldn in summary the amplification of potential energy due to the decreasing reference basis during the rundown phase and its conversion to kinetic energy result in the high rh of the ldn on steep slopes similar to the momentum paradigm noted above the rhs of the ldn are proportional to μ on the steep slopes as shown in fig 4 4 3 energy paradigm on gb while an n wave is propagating on a slope the wave becomes steeper because its celerity changes with variations in water depth at the same time the curvature of the wave profile sharpens and alters its sign which induces horizontal pressure gradients soares frazao 2002 kim and lynett 2011 and eventually creates a secondary wave fig 8 captures the profiles of the ldn and len at the instant when a secondary wave begins to be generated on the main wave of the positive waves in the given spatial range of fig 8 b the magnitudes of curvature of the ldn are approximately 10 100 times larger than those of the len as a result a secondary wave appears on the ldn but not on the len even though both positive waves are at the same location this also implies that the len may generate a secondary wave after it travels further to the shoreline therefore an undular bore can occur farther from the shoreline on the ldn than on the len as shown in fig 8 a and b which means that the ldn is more likely to develop a higher and shorter secondary wave until it breaks down a higher and shorter wave represents a condition that is prone to collapsing for the given cases in fig 9 the calculated distances from the breaking points to the shoreline of the ldn and len are approximately 17 km and 11 km respectively accordingly more of the energy of the ldn will likely be dissipated by breaking over a longer travelling distance than that of the len with the same incident wave height and period finally when the positive wave front of the ldn arrives at the beach as represented by line 3 in fig 9 the magnitudes of the relative potential and kinetic energy will become weaker than those of the len this entire process is clearly described in fig 9 a3 a4 b3 and b4 in addition larger μ also indicates more chance to develop a higher and shorter secondary wave than smaller μ thus the rhs of the ldn is inversely proportional to μ on the mild slopes due to the wave breaking as shown in fig 4 4 4 momentum paradigm on gb fig 9 a2 and b2 show the momentum of the n wave on the gb calculated by eq 3 as shown in this figure the paradigms of the momentum before and after the onset of wave breaking are clearly different before the positive wave front reaches the breaking point the momentum shows an oscillating pattern due to the secondary wave as shown in line 1 after the positive wave front passes the breaking point as shown in lines 2 4 the magnitude of momentum significantly decreases because the breaking attenuates the secondary wave height and flow velocity appeared in the leading order terms of eq 3 consequently when the positive fronts of the n wave arrive at the shoreline the momentums on the gb decrease greatly in comparison with that of the n wave on the sb in fig 6 where secondary wave breaking is not observed as described in the above section the ldn can exhibit higher runup than the len on steep slopes due to the large depression of the water surface that occurs during the rundown phase which later induces strong onshore directed momentum due to the steeper ζ x however on gb the breaking induced attenuation considerably weakens the offshore directed momentum of the ldn during the rundown phase thus this weak momentum results in a small decrease in the water surface during rundown in turn the weak onshore directed momentum generated by a relatively gentle water surface gradient will eventually produce a smaller runup height than that of the len on gb 4 5 mass flux paradigm on the sb and gb the depth averaged horizontal velocity at the location where ζ 0 i e aa in fig 10 or the interface between positive and negative waves is not always zero on an uneven bottom thus mass or volume exchange occurs between the control volumes depicted in fig 1 of the positive and negative waves at that location kim and son 2018 throughout all of the tested len cases it was found that the horizontal velocity at aa is directed offshore and thus the water in the control volume of the positive wave moves through aa to the control volume of the negative wave as shown in fig 10 a kim and son 2018 on the other hand for all of the ldn cases simulated in this study the flow direction at aa is directed onshore and thus the water in the control volume of the positive wave moves to the control volume of the negative wave through aa as shown in fig 10 b therefore the void area surrounded by the negative wave profile and mean sea level ζ 0 is gradually filled with the water released from the control volume of the positive wave when the waves approach the shoreline regardless of whether they are the ldn or len this process explains why and how the wave profile of the n wave becomes flattened and closer to the mean sea level as it approaches the shoreline separately to the wave breaking or wave bathymetry interactions the accumulated volume flux through aa is proportional to the travel time from the slope toe to the shoreline on a plain slope the travel time of a tsunami from the slope toe to the shoreline is given as t c 2 s h s g where h s is the water depth of the slope toe kim and son 2018 thus it is evident that a greater mass or volume of water in the control volume of the positive wave moves to the control volume of the negative wave on a mildly sloped bathymetry than it does on a steeply sloped bathymetry therefore the volume of the positive wave when it reaches the shoreline becomes very small if s is very small the examples in figs 6 and 9 show that when the positive waves of s 1 15 arrive at the shoreline the water volume above the mean sea level is much larger than that when s 1 600 it is important to mention that the wave height reduction caused by the mass transport through aa should be distinguished from that caused by the wave breaking 5 conclusion in this study the runup of simplified n type tsunamis and their physical characteristics were investigated considering geophysical scale bathymetry and wave breaking idealized conditions were adopted for the incident wave and bathymetry to determine the fundamental relationships between the geometric features of incident wave and bathymetry and the runup characteristics to obtain accurate tsunami simulations higher order effects such as wave dispersion and breaking were included because they are considered the major factors affecting the evolution and runup of a tsunami the momentum and energy of the ldn and len type tsunamis were estimated using the depth integrated eqs 3 5 based on long wave scales the major findings obtained from the simulation results under the simplified wave and bathymetry conditions considering geophysical scale and their analysis are summarized as follows 1 under the geophysical scale the rhs of the n waves are proportional to s 1 and s on relatively steep and mild slopes the former result is consistent with those obtained from previous studies but the latter result contrasts with those of previous studies 2 on the steeply sloped bathymetry the rh of the ldn is higher than that of the len however the rh of the ldn is lower than that of the len on the mildly sloped bathymetry which was not explained by previous studies 3 the descending water surface during the rundown process amplifies the onshore directed momentum and potential energy which is then transformed into kinetic energy thus the ldn induces a higher rh than the len on steeply sloped bathymetry 4 on mildly sloped bathymetry a secondary wave forms on the main wave and then breaks down which significantly dissipates the potential and kinetic energy necessary for runup this process is more active in the ldn than in the len thus the ldn is likely to lose more energy and momentum than the len 5 on sloped bathymetry the negative wave gains the water released from the positive wave through the interface between the negative and positive waves aa in fig 10 because it takes longer for a tsunami to travel on mildly sloped bathymetry the accumulated flux can be sufficiently large to make the water surface flatter over a longer distance thus a relatively small wave height and volume will remain when a tsunami arrives at the shoreline across a very long and mildly sloped bathymetry such as a continental shelf the limitations of the proposed conclusions are clear the use of idealized bathymetry and incident waves unlike real field conditions and limited cases of initial wave profiles many factors contributing to the two dimensional evolution of a tsunami such as refraction and diffraction were not considered in addition many key geophysical processes were completely neglected including the actual generation of the tsunamis through a complex rupture process among many others lastly although n waves are a more appropriate model for a tsunami wave than solitary wave or others they are still very different from the waveform of real tsunami in field therefore the specific numbers proposed in the results and discussion may not be an absolute criterion however although there are still many uncertainties to overcome the simple but well defined concept proposed in this study can be used to help analyse complex computational results and observation data in real fields the following is the supplementary data related to this article fig s1 profiles of relative ζ m o e ϕ and e k of a ldn and b len on gentle bathymetry s 1 600 μ 1 numbers indicate the timing of the following events 1

24031,taking advantage of alternative expressions for potential vorticity pv in divergence forms we derive balances between volume integral of pv and boundary conditions that are then applied to practical computations of pv we propose a new method for diagnosing the ertel potential vorticity from model output that preserves the balances we show how the expression of pv can be derived in general coordinate systems this is here emphasised with isopycnic coordinates by generalising the pv expression to the general navier stokes equations we propose a generalised derivation for the haynes mcintyre impermeability theorem which highlights the role of the bottom boundary condition choice e g no slip vs free slip and mixing near the bottom boundary for the volume integral of pv the implications of balances between volume integral of pv and boundary conditions are then analysed for specific processes at various scales at large scale we show how an integral involving surface observations derived from satellite observations is linked to the integral of pv within a layer between two isopycnals this surface integral can be calculated for models and observations and can be used for validation at mesoscale or sub mesoscale we analyse the relationship between net pv anomalies and net surface density anomalies for idealised vortices and 2d fronts this can help determining vortex or jet structures for idealised studies or empirical methodologies we also confirm and integrate previous results on the modification of pv within a bottom boundary layer into a single diagnostic taking into account the effect of density and velocity modifications by diabatic processes along the topography and diapycnal mixing within the boundary layer keywords potential vorticity

circulation at all scales in geophysical fluids the conservation property of pv in adiabatic evolution and the inversion principle the geostrophic velocity field can be inferred from the pv field and boundary conditions are key principles to interpret the ocean dynamics see hoskins et al 1985 mcwilliams 2006 and section 2 for more details conservation and inversion of pv are the basis of the quasigeostrophic qg model pedlosky 1987 that has been successfully used in pioneering studies aiming at understanding and modelling the ocean circulation from basin gyres rhines and young 1982a b luyten et al 1983 holland et al 1984 rhines 1986 talley 1988 marshall and nurser 1992 to current instabilities charney and stern 1962 geophysical turbulence mcwilliams 1984 and mesoscale dynamics mcwilliams and flierl 1979 sutyrin and flierl 1994 in the qg framework pv is related to the streamfunction by a linear elliptic differential operator pedlosky 1987 cushman roisin and beckers 2011 which has several important consequences first boundary conditions impose important dynamical constraints too in a qg framework bretherton 1966 has shown that surface or bottom outcropping of isopycnic surfaces is dynamically similar to a shallow layer of high pv anomaly in practice a dirac delta sheet whose strength can be related to the density anomaly this has led to the generalised surface quasigeostrophic sqg model held et al 1995 lapeyre 2017 lateral boundaries can be important too for the inversion of pv in the qg or sqg framework it has been shown that the velocity field away from a region of pv anomalies decreases slowly as the inverse of the distance from the region unless pv and surface density satisfy an integral constraint morel and mcwilliams 1997 assassi et al 2016 in models practical inversion of pv with given surface and bottom density fields is often done considering biperiodic domains lapeyre et al 2006 wang et al 2013 which can lead to discrepancies if the latter constraint is not satisfied second since the relationship between pv and the circulation is linear at first order qg and sqg the balance between smoothed averaged fields is preserved provided averaging is done using a linear convolution moreover pv concept is also useful for forced dissipative dynamics for instance diapycnal mixing does not change the volume integral of pv within a layer bounded by isopycnic surfaces which shows that pv can only be diluted or concentrated when the layer respectively gains or looses mass haynes and mcintyre 1987 1990 the influence of viscous surface or bottom stress on the pv evolution has also been analysed theoretically thomas 2005 taylor and ferrari 2010 benthuysen and thomas 2012 2013 thus the consequences of diabatic effects on the ocean dynamics can again be analysed and interpreted in terms of pv modification from basin scales see for instance hallberg and rhines 1996 2000 czaja and hausmann 2009 to meso and submesoscales see for instance morel and mcwilliams 2001 morel et al 2006 morel and thomas 2009 rossi et al 2010 meunier et al 2010 thomas et al 2013 molemaker et al 2015 gula et al 2019 2015 2016 vic et al 2015 giordani et al 2017 to conclude the ocean circulation and pv are linked and calculating pv at all scales under adiabatic or diabatic conditions is thus of considerable interest for geophysical fluid dynamics in qg or sqg models it is possible to ensure consistent balances between circulation pv and surface bottom and lateral boundary conditions from local to averaged fields in more complex models pv calculation involves many velocity and density derivatives in particular in non isopycnic models and keeping the link between averaged pv and averaged circulation implies to find a consistent calculation of pv if several studies have used diagnostics involving pv they remain rare and none have discussed the pv calculations in details in particular to evaluate if the relationships between pv and boundary conditions are maintained and if averaging can be done consistently the bretherton principle bretherton 1966 has been recently revisited and extended by schneider et al 2003 who generalised the concept of pv to take into account the dynamical effect of outcropping for the general navier stokes equations to do so they used the alternative divergence form for the expression of pv vallis 2006 in this paper we show how this divergence form of pv naturally leads to general constraints on volume balances of pv and boundary conditions section 3 these follow from the definition of pv and are independent of the dynamics adiabatic or diabatic of the flow in section 4 we show that the divergence form also makes pv computations easier and consistent in the sense that balances are automatically preserved when integrating pv a consequence of the divergence form we then propose several frameworks involving dynamics at different scales to discuss the generalised constraints between pv and surface bottom or lateral boundary conditions section 5 we summarise and discuss our results in the concluding section section 2 summarises basic definitions and properties of pv which are not new and can be skipped by readers familiar with pv 2 reminders on potential vorticity 2 1 definition of ertel potential vorticity ertel 1942 defined potential vorticity as 1 p v e r t e l u f ρ ρ u a ρ ρ where u is the fluid velocity field in the reference frame of the rotating earth ρ is the potential density in the ocean and entropy in the atmosphere u a u ω r is the absolute velocity where ω 0 ω y ω z is the rotation vector of the earth r is the position relative to the earth center and f 0 f y f z ω r 2 ω see fig 1 note that f is fixed but its components in some coordinate system spherical coordinates for instance can vary with position the minus sign on the left hand side of eq 1 is so that pv is generally positive for gravitationally stable low rossby number flows in the northern hemisphere in the ocean the boussinesq approximation is typically valid and ρ ρ can be replaced by ρ ρ 0 where ρ 0 is a mean oceanic density ρ 0 can then be omitted from the definition of pv and we can use 2 p v e r t e l u f ρ u a ρ we retain this definition for pv as it leads to clearer expressions for the calculations we present and the formulas we obtain this approximation is however not necessary and all the following results are valid provided ρ is replaced by g ρ log ρ see appendix b 2 2 properties 2 2 1 conservation the non hydrostatic navier stokes equations with boussinesq approximation are 3 d d t u f u p ρ 0 g ρ ρ 0 f d i v u 0 d d t ρ ρ where u u v w is the velocity field d d t ϕ t ϕ u ϕ f 0 f y f z is the coriolis vector p is the pressure ρ is the potential density and f f x f y f z and ρ are terms associated with diabatic processes for momentum and density fields the lagrangian evolution of ertel pv can be derived from eq 3 4 d d t p v e r t e l f ρ u f ρ as shown by ertel 1942 pv ertel is thus conserved in regions where diabatic processes are negligible the evolution conservation of pv following fluid particles is a major constraint for geophysical fluid dynamics hoskins et al 1985 to study geophysical fluids simplified forms of eq 3 are sought which conserve a simplified expression for pv white et al 2005 this is the case for instance for quasigeostrophic or primitive equations pedlosky 1987 cushman roisin and beckers 2011 mcwilliams 2006 for the primitive equations the hydrostatic approximation is assumed and f y is neglected pv can be written white et al 2005 5 p v p e x v y u f z z ρ z v x ρ z u y ρ where f z is the local vertical component of the coriolis vector and is called coriolis parameter the lagrangian conservation of pv pe is more conveniently derived and achieved in numerical models using density ρ instead of the geopotential vertical coordinate z this has been one of the motivation for the development of isopycnic coordinate ocean models see for instance bleck et al 1992 hallberg 1997 using isopycnic coordinate pv pe can be written cushman roisin and beckers 2011 6 p v p e ζ f z h where ζ x v y u ρ is the relative vorticity now calculated using horizontal velocity components along isopycnic surfaces and h ρ z is a measure of the local stratification we will see below how the expression of pv can be easily derived in isopycnic coordinates for the full navier stokes equations including terms coming from all components of the coriolis vector and non hydrostatic effects 2 2 2 inversion if cyclo geostrophy is assumed the velocity field and stratification can be calculated from the pv and are associated with the balanced dynamics hoskins et al 1985 davis and emanuel 1991 mcintyre and norton 2000 morel and mcwilliams 2001 herbette et al 2003 2005 the pv of a fluid at rest and with a horizontally homogeneous stratification is not null the potential vorticity anomaly pva is defined as the difference between total pv and a reference pv associated with a state of rest of the entire fluid 7 p v a p v p v r e s t pv a is the part of the pv that is linked to the balanced dynamics and at first order it corresponds to the quasigeostrophic pv davis and emanuel 1991 mcintyre and norton 2000 herbette et al 2003 the pv of the state at rest is given by the stratification at rest 8 p v r e s t f ρ ρ f z z ρ ρ f z ρ z ρ f z h an important point is that in eq 7 pva has to be calculated along surfaces of constant density this is underlined by the ρ symbol in eq 8 which is valid for both non hydrostatic and primitive equations the stratification at rest ρ is associated with the adiabatic rearrangement of the density to get a horizontally uniform field holliday and mcintyre 1981 kang and fringer 2010 and it is generally not easy to determine pva is thus often used in idealised configurations where the fluid is at rest in some area generally at the edge of the domain see sections 5 2 and 5 3 below alternatively pva can be associated with small scale processes superposed on a larger scale circulation the reference state can then be approximately determined as a spatial average over a distance that is much larger than the processes scales 3 alternative expressions for pv 3 1 divergence form in the following the calculations rely on general mathematical properties relating divergence curl and gradient of 3d fields and integral properties of these operators whose general forms are recalled in appendix a previous studies have shown that ertel pv as defined in eq 2 can be expressed in divergence form see schneider et al 2003 vallis 2006 trivial manipulations explained in appendix a see eq a 1 lead to the following equivalent expressions for the pv in divergence form remember u a u ω r is the absolute velocity see fig 1 9c p v e r t e l d i v u a ρ d i v ρ u a d i v u ρ d i v ρ f notice that these expressions are exact whatever the evolution diabatic or adiabatic of pv and have been reported and or used before in particular in atmospheric sciences see haynes and mcintyre 1987 bretherton and schar 1993 schneider et al 2003 vallis 2006 here we demonstrate that they also lead to consistent and convenient practical approach to calculating and analysing pv in ocean modelling 3 2 implication for the integral of pv using ostrogradsky stokes theorem see appendix a the previous divergence form of the pv simplifies the calculation of the integral of pv ertel over a volume v it can be calculated from the knowledge of the density velocity or relative vorticity fields around the surface v containing v eqs 9 give the exact expressions 10c v p v e r t e l d v v ρ u a d s v u a ρ d s v ρ f d s v u ρ d s the previous expressions follow from the definition of pv and do not depend on equations governing its evolution they represent exact instantaneous diagnostics of net pv within a volume and should not be confused with the general flux form of the pv evolution equation haynes and mcintyre 1987 4 applications to the calculation of pv in this section we discuss how the divergence formulation and its associated integral constraints eq 10 yield an easier way to diagnose pv and maintain balances between volume integral of pv and boundary conditions eq 10 4 1 pv diagnostics for numerical models the diagnosis of pv from numerical model outputs is generally cumbersome if the literal form eq 2 or eq 5 is chosen as it implies numerous gradients calculated at different grid points which then have to be averaged the use of the divergence form simplifies the pv calculation and also preserves eq 10 as they are used in the majority of ocean circulation models we consider a 3d c grid which are 3d extensions of the horizontal arakawa c grid see fig 2 and arakawa and lamb 1977 using cartesian coordinates we start from the divergence form of pv 9b rewritten as 11 p v e r t e l d i v ρ ζ f x ρ ζ x f x y ρ ζ y f y z ρ ζ z f z where ζ u and 12 ζ x y w z v ζ y x w z u ζ z x v y u the elementary cell for which pv is calculated has the density values at its corners see fig 2 as is clear from fig 2 ζ z values need to be calculated at the center of lower and upper sides of the cell it can be calculated using the circulation along edges of the cell lower and upper sides an interesting property of 3d c grid is that this is straightforward thanks to the position of the velocity points located at the middle of edges parallel to the velocity component density is averaged over the 4 density points located at the side corners the same calculation is also valid for the other sides of the cell as a result the pv of the cell can easily be calculated from physical fields within this single cell we get 13 ζ i j k x w i j k w i j 1 k δ y v i j k v i j k 1 δ z ζ i j k y w i j k w i 1 j k δ y u i j k u i j k 1 δ z ζ i j k z v i j k v i 1 j k δ x u i j k u i j 1 k δ y and finally 14 p v i j k ρ x i j k ζ i j k x f i j k x ρ x i 1 j k ζ i 1 j k x f i 1 j k x δ x ρ y i j k ζ i j k y f i j k y ρ y i j 1 k ζ i j 1 k y f i j 1 k y δ y ρ z i j k ζ i j k z f i j k z ρ z i j k 1 ζ i j k 1 z f i j k 1 z δ z where 15 ρ x i j k 1 4 ρ i j k ρ i j k 1 ρ i j 1 k ρ i j 1 k 1 is the density calculated at the position of ζ i j k x see fig 2 and so forth for the other components the coriolis components f i j k x y z are calculated at the location of the ζ i j k x y z points note that for the specific discretization of the 3d c grid see fig 2 the divergence form leads to a compact expression of pv in eq 14 pv is calculated using density and velocity values from a single grid cell eq 14 has a flux form which ensures that given a volume v the integral of pv calculated over v using the accumulation of individual cells or using eq 10 exactly match thus preserving the general balances between integral of pv and boundary conditions for any volume flux form pv expressions can be derived for b grids or other grids with a similar property 4 2 general pv expression in isopycnal coordinates the integral constraints 10 may be used for an easier derivation of the expression of pv in any coordinate systems and for the full navier stokes equations as an example we calculate pv using the isopycnic coordinate ρ instead of the geopotential coordinate z see section 4a of schneider et al 2003 this is of interest as the interpretation of the pv evolution in particular the pv anomaly has to be made along isopycnic surfaces hoskins et al 1985 for the sake of simplicity we just replace the vertical cartesian coordinate z by ρ and we keep the cartesian x y coordinates in the horizontal see fig 3 other systems for instance spherical can be used without much more complications we also keep the orthogonal cartesian elementary vectors i j k associated with axis ox oy oz see fig 3 to express all vectors in this framework z z x y ρ is the vertical position of isopycnic surfaces and to calculate pv we will use eq 10b which only requires the evaluation of the density gradient ρ x ρ i y ρ j z ρ k but using the x y ρ coordinates to do so we use h ρ z 1 z ρ x z y ρ h x ρ y z y z x ρ h y ρ x z the density gradient is then given by 16 ρ 1 h x z i y z j k eq 10b is then applied to an elementary volume bounded by two isopycnic surfaces sketched in fig 3 17 δ v p v e r t e l d v δ v u a ρ d s u a ρ d s δ v where δv is the flux through all surfaces delimiting δv note that u a u a i v a j w a k remains the absolute velocity field expressed in the orthogonal cartesian system since the flux across isopycnic surfaces ρ δρ is null and since the other surfaces are simple vertical planes of constant y or x eq 17 gives 18 p v e r t e l ρ δ v u a ρ i 2 δ y 2 h δ ρ x δ x x δ x u a ρ j 2 δ x 2 h δ ρ y δ y y δ y given that δv 2δx2δy 2δz 2δx 2δy 2hδρ and 19 u a ρ 1 h v a w a y z u a w a x z u a y z v a x z eq 18 gives 20 p v e r t e l ρ x v a w a y z ρ y u a w a x z ρ h x v w y z ρ y u w x z ρ f z f y y z h which is a generalised form of eq 6 with additional terms in particular all components of the coriolis effect the terms u w x z ρ v w y z ρ represent the projection of the velocity field on the plane tangent to the isopycnic surface this exact general result can also be derived using eq 2 with a change of coordinate but the calculations based on eq 10 offer a straightforward method 4 3 integration of pv in a layer we consider a volume v constituted of a layer embedded between two isopycnic surfaces associated with densities ρ 1 and ρ 2 that can outcrop at the surface or bottom see fig 4 the total pv contained within v may be deduced from eq 10c and trivial calculations taking advantage of the fact that the boundaries v of the layer are partly delimited by isentropic isopycnic surfaces and some rearrangements using eq a 4 this leads to the following form which depends only on physical fields at the surface and bottom outcropping regions 21 v p v e r t e l d v s s s b s w u ρ d s s s ρ 1 ρ s d s s b s w ρ 1 ρ b d s s ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 2 d s f where ρ s x y is the density at the ocean surface and ρ b x y the density along the bottom of the ocean this form takes advantage of the expression eq 10c to deal with volumes delimited by the two isopycnal surfaces s ρ 1 and s ρ 2 part of the layer boundaries are however associated with outcropping surfaces where density varies s s s w and s b see fig 4 the first right hand side term of eq 21 depends on u ρ and has to be evaluated along these surfaces for this term depending on the boundary condition used it may be more convenient to switch back to a form in ρ ζ like in eq 10a this has to be done carefully using eq a 4 see appendix a for instance we obtain for the surface s s 22 s s u ρ d s s s ρ 1 ρ s ζ s d x d y finally notice that the bottom surface has been divided in sidewalls and bottom regions s w and s b see fig 4 possibly associated with different boundary conditions this is artificial if both surfaces are associated with the seafloor but we did make a difference for the sake of generality for instance in academic configurations such as a rectangular basin boundary conditions at the walls and at the bottom can differ 4 4 impermeability theorem the impermeability theorem haynes and mcintyre 1987 1990 states that there is no net transport of pv across isopycnic or isentropic surfaces whatever the evolution as already shown by vallis 2006 eq 10b is a straightforward demonstration of this theorem indeed across such surfaces d s is parallel to ρ and eq 10b shows that they do not contribute to the calculation of the pv volume integral whatever the evolution of the isopycnic surfaces thus if there are no outcropping regions and the isopycnic surfaces are closed the volume integral of ertel pv within closed isopycnic surfaces is and remains null whatever the evolution alternatively modification of the volume integral of pv in an isopycnic layer is only possible when isopycnic surfaces outcrop haynes and mcintyre 1987 this principle can be slightly extended considering a layer without surface outcropping and considering a no slip boundary condition at the ocean bottom u w u b 0 eq 21 gives 23 v p v e r t e l d v s b s w ρ 1 ρ b d s s ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 2 d s f if u w u b 0 the density distribution along the bottom can only be modified by diabatic mixing effects along the bottom if the latter are negligible the density field along the bottom is constant and eq 23 then shows that there is no modification of the volume integral of pv indeed in this case both terms in the right hand side of eq 23 are constant this is obvious for the first term the second term is simply the scalar product of f constant and the net s ρ 2 surface vector the latter only depends on the position of the edge of the surface defined by the ρ 2 contour along the bottom and thus constant too an alternative way to demonstrate this is to transform the second term using eq a 4 see appenix a to conclude with no slip boundary conditions the volume integral of pv is only modified if there exists mixing of the density near the bottom in practice the free slip boundary condition is often preferred in ocean circulation models the implication for the generation of pv will be discussed below section 5 4 another case of interest is when outcropping only occurs at the surface and sidewalls fig 4 b in numerical models sidewalls are sometimes considered vertical and the f y component of the coriolis vector is also neglected so that f d s 0 if no slip boundary conditions are used many terms disappear in eq 21 and we then obtain 24 v p v e r t e l d v s s u ρ d s s s f z ρ 1 ρ s d s this draws attention to the potential importance of sloping boundaries and the f y component for the volume integral of pv at basin scale it also shows that the surface terms in eq 24 are of special interest and we further evaluate their contributions in the next section 5 applications to specific balances as discussed in the introduction there exists a strong link between ocean circulation and the pv field from mesoscale eddies to large scale currents eq 21 shows that there exists a balance between a volume integral of pv and boundary conditions using the divergence form of pv and the local pv calculation discussed in section 4 1 allows to preserve this balance this is important for the physical interpretation of model outputs in terms of pv in this section we illustrate how the balance can be used at several scales and for various processes in realistic or idealised configurations for which some terms in eq 21 can be easily evaluated from observations e g the surface ones simplified or neglected e g for no slip boundary conditions in section 5 1 we discuss how time variations of large scale volume integral of pv can be related to surface fields for both models and observations at mesoscale surface density anomalies play a role similar to pva bretherton 1966 in sections 5 2 and 5 3 we show how eq 21 can be applied to isolated vortices and jets we show that the balance leads to a precise relationship between surface density anomalies and pva integrals which has to be satisfied for isolated vortices and jets finally in section 5 4 we show how eq 21 can be applied to study the modification of pv in the bottom boundary layer underlining the strong impact of the boundary conditions free no slip 5 1 surface outcropping regions as indicators of the circulation of deep layers for some choices of boundary conditions eq 21 reduces to eq 24 in addition pv can be quickly modified by diabatic processes at the surface thomas 2005 morel et al 2006 thomas and ferrari 2008 thomas et al 2013 wenegrat et al 2018 we can thus hypothesise that the surface term i s u r f s s ρ 1 ρ s f u ρ s d s dominates the time evolutions of the integral of pv within a deeper layer which is itself linked to modification of the circulation rhines and young 1982a b luyten et al 1983 holland et al 1984 rhines 1986 thomas and rhines 2002 polton and marshall 2003 deremble et al 2014 comparing i surf from numerical models and observations is thus of interest using d s k d x d y where k is the vertical elementary vector i surf can be rewritten 25 i s u r f s s ρ 1 ρ s f u ρ s k d x d y note that the integral in eq 25 only requires the knowledge of surface fields in particular u ρ s k only depends on the horizontal gradient of the surface density i surf can be calculated directly for numerical models for observations satellite observations possibly complemented by in situ surface drifter observations provide good estimates of the surface circulation over most of the ocean down to scales of order 25 km see for instance sudre and morrow 2008 abernathey and marshall 2013 rio et al 2014 to do so the surface current is split into a geostrophic component and a component induced by the wind stress 26 u s u g e o u τ the geostrophic component u g e o and the associated relative vorticity can be calculated from the knowledge of the sea surface height ssh observed by satellite altimetry 27 u g e o g f z k s s h the wind induced surface current can be evaluated from satellite scatterometer observations and using the wind induced ekman spiral which gives see cushman roisin and beckers 2011 28 u τ τ w π 4 f z ν where ν is the turbulent eddy viscosity and 29 τ w π 4 ρ a ρ o c d w w π 4 where w π 4 is the surface wind but whose orientation has been rotated by π 4 ρ a ρ o is the ratio of the air to ocean density and c d 3 10 3 is the turbulent transfer parameter as a result the surface term contributing to the calculation of the observed pv within a layer eq 25 can be written 30 i s u r f s s ρ 1 ρ s f z g f z k s s h ρ a c d w w π 4 ρ o f z ν ρ s k d x d y and can be calculated from the observed sea surface density calculated using sss and sst from smos aquarius and microwave satellite observations ssh and surface wind all fields generally available over most of the ocean at 1 4 resolution we believe the comparison of i surf from numerical models eq 25 and from observations eq 30 can provide an interesting new diagnostic for the validation of global or basin scale numerical models 5 2 constraints for coherent isolated vortices most observed eddies in the ocean are isolated 1 1 an isolated vortex has a velocity field that decreases more rapidly than 1 r where r is the distance from its center and the horizontal integral of its vorticity is null at any level chelton et al 2011 in qg and sqg models for coherent isolated vortices the volume integral of pva and surface density field are linked morel and mcwilliams 1997 assassi et al 2016 we here extend this balance to ertel pva consider a flat earth for which f 0 0 f z f plane approximation and an axisymmetric vortex over a flat bottom see fig 5 b d for the sake of simplicity we also hypothesise that ρ is constant at the bottom and that p v r e s t is spatially uniform linear stratification at rest integrating the pva over the control volume v o see fig 5 b d gives 31 v o p v a d v v o p v e r t e l p v r e s t d v v o f ρ p v r e s t d v v o u ρ d v by using that p v r e s t f z ρ s ρ b h eq a 1b and the fact that the vortex is isolated we get 32 v o f ρ p v r e s t d v s s ρ s ρ s f z d x d y and 33 v o u ρ d v v o ρ u d s s s ρ s ζ s u r f d x d y o 1 r s s ρ s ρ s ζ s u r f d x d y o 1 r where ζ surf x v y u is the relative vorticity at the surface ρ s is the surface density at rest or the surface density far from the vortex center and ρ s ρ s is the surface density anomaly associated with the vortex 2 2 in eq 33 the last line is obtained since s s ζ d x d y 0 for isolated vortices the o 1 r term accounts for the integration over the bottom and lateral boundaries dashed contours in fig 5 in particular the lateral contribution scales as ρh 2π r z u r o 1 r the o 1 r rate of decrease is symbolic and the term simply indicates that these contributions vanish when r integration of eq 31 over the whole infinite domain shows that pv anomalies associated with isolated vortices have to satisfy 34 p v a d v s s ρ s ρ s ζ s u r f f z d x d y 0 this extends the integral constraints found in assassi et al 2016 which is modified for strong surface vorticity when ζ surf f z 3 3 strictly speaking strong anticyclonic vortices for which ζ surf f z could even reverse the sign of the deep pva but these structures are subject to inertial instability and are not long lived structures this is the case for submesoscale vortices lapeyre et al 2006 klein et al 2008 capet et al 2008 roullet et al 2012 gula et al 2015 molemaker et al 2015 capet et al 2016 thus for isolated vortices a positive surface density anomaly is accompanied with negative pva a positive surface density is equivalent to a positive dirac delta sheet of pva bretherton 1966 a similar constraint holds for a negative density anomaly hence the generalised pva structure of isolated vortices has both positive and negative values which implies opposite sign pv gradient and opens the possibility of barotropic baroclinic instabilities charney and stern 1962 ripa 1991 this has an impact on the evolution stability and displacement of the vortex see morel and mcwilliams 1997 in idealised studies dealing with the dynamics of isolated vortices instability of the initial vortex structure can spoil the analysis and it is preferential to use specific methods based on the inversion of stable pv structures to initialise isolated vortices in models see herbette et al 2003 moreover the constraint eq 34 can have implications for methodologies deriving velocity fields of vortices from surface density observations the methodologies empirically generate pva distributions based on large scale pv distributions or statistical correlations between surface density observations and pva lapeyre et al 2006 lapeyre and klein 2006 lapeyre 2009 ponte et al 2013 wang et al 2013 fresnay et al 2018 in general the derived pva distributions do not satisfy constraint 34 the consequence is that the velocity field of a reconstructed vortex decreases slowly which can lead to spurious calculations near lateral boundaries the methodologies often consider periodic boundary conditions it could be interesting to modify the methodologies so as to satisfy eq 34 in the vicinity of each vortex we however have no clue on the spatial distribution of the pva from the constraint pva poles crown vertically aligned or not vertical position within the water column possibly multiple poles of opposite sign and the reconstruction of the vertical vortex pva have thus to be done carefully 5 3 constraints for jets and surface fronts similar constraints can be found for density fronts associated with jet like currents we consider a 2d configuration with no variation in the y direction in 2d eq 10 becomes 35 s p v e r t e l d s s ρ u a n d l s u a ρ n d l s ρ f n d l s u ρ n d l consider a 2d front outcropping at the surface but with a constant density along a flat bottom see fig 6 the velocity field can be written u v x z j where v is the velocity component along the y axis for jet like currents the velocity vanishes away from the front v x z 0 the stratification is different on both sides of the front and varies from ρ z to ρ z for this configuration the determination of the reference pv associated with the state at rest is slightly more delicate as we hypothesised that both the left and right edges of the front are at rest it has however to be chosen at the left edge as only this side covers the entire density range the reference pv is thus p v r e s t and we then integrate pva from x to x l again for the sake of simplification we hypothesise that f 0 0 f z and p v r e s t is spatially uniform trivial manipulations yield an equation similar to eq 33 36 s p v a d s s p v e r t e l p v r e s t d s x l ρ ρ z 0 ζ z f z z 0 d x z h z 0 z ρ v x l d z assuming the velocity has a jet like structure v x l z becomes small enough so that the last term in eq 36 can be neglected given the density structure discussed here see fig 6 ρ ρ z 0 is positive which shows that a negative pva must exist below the outcropping region for jets if ζ z f z remains positive opposite sign generalised pva is necessarily associated with opposite sign pva gradients and to instability charney and stern 1962 similarly to isolated vortices integral constraint 36 can be useful to study the instability of surface fronts and for methods aiming at reconstructing the ocean at mesoscale and submesoscale via an estimation of pva within the water column lapeyre et al 2006 ponte et al 2013 spall 1995 boss et al 1996 manucharyan and timmermans 2013 5 4 pv modification by bottom boundary layer processes to study the modification of pv by necessarily diabatic processes eq 4 complemented with the knowledge of diabatic terms is needed benthuysen and thomas 2012 molemaker et al 2015 gula et al 2019 2015 however as shown next integral constraints may provide an interesting way to monitor the pv evolution within an isopycnic layer intersecting the topography to do so let us consider the development of a bottom boundary layer in 2d with no variation in the y direction fig 7 we also consider that there is no outcropping at the surface and we follow a control area a 2d bounded by two isopycnic surfaces ρ 1 and ρ 2 the topography and a vertical boundary located at a distance l sufficiently large so that we can consider being away from the boundary layer and unaffected by the diabatic processes the stratification and velocity field are unchanged see fig 7 integration of pv over this area gives see eq 35 37 a 2 d p v e r t e l d a s w ρ 1 ρ b n d l s ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 2 n d l f s w u ρ n d l s v z ρ d z given its definition the last term in eq 37 does not vary the isopycnic levels initially intersect the topography at x 0 and x l and along the topography the velocity field is v o j fig 7a after some diabatic processes involving the viscous boundary layer and diapycnal mixing the velocity profile and the position of isopycnic surfaces are modified the positions of the intersection with the topography are now x l 1 and x l 2 and the velocity field along the topography is v j fig 7b some trivial manipulations give 38 s w ρ 1 ρ b n f d l f z l 1 l 2 ρ 1 ρ b d x s ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 2 n f d l f z ρ 2 ρ 1 l l 2 s w u ρ n d l ρ 1 ρ 2 v d ρ assuming a linear variation of the density along the bottom topography this gives for the initial condition see fig 7 39 a 2 d p v e r t e l d a f z ρ 2 ρ 1 l l

the average is weighted by density the net modification of the volume integral of pv within the layer is thus 41 δ l a y e r p v ρ 2 ρ 1 f z δ x b o t ρ 1 ρ 2 ρ 2 ρ 1 δ v b o t ρ 1 ρ 2 where δ v b o t ρ 1 ρ 2 v v o is the modification of the mean velocity field along the bottom and within the layer ρ 1 ρ 2 and δ x b o t ρ 1 ρ 2 l 1 l 2 l 2 is the modification of the mean x position of the layer along the bottom if no slip conditions are chosen at the bottom we recover that only density mixing along the bottom can modify the volume integral of pv within a layer as already discussed in section 4 4 the time evolution of the volume integral of pv then only depends on the variation of the position of the intersection of the isopycnic layer it is negative if the layer goes downslope destratification case as illustrated in fig 7 and positive if the layer goes upslope restratification case our results are qualitatively consistent with benthuysen and thomas 2012 despite the fact that we consider a layer and not a fixed box for the volume integral of pv eq 41 allows the possibility to consider free slip bottom conditions free slip boundary conditions is the constraint usually used in numerical models and can provide an additional modification of the volume integral of pv if viscous effects are considered as first imagined by d asaro 1988 these viscous effects have to be added to the effect of the modification of density studied in benthuysen and thomas 2012 and discussed above eq 41 shows that they superimpose when calculating the volume integral of pv and generally act similarly since our results are only diagnostics we have to imagine the evolution of the velocity and density fields along the boundary to evaluate the possible pv modification if we consider a velocity field with the shallow region on its right v o 0 as depicted in fig 7 in the northern hemisphere the bottom friction develops a downslope ekman flux that leads to destratification and mixing induces a negative volume integral of pv variation we can also assume that bottom friction also acts so as to reduce the strength of the velocity along the bottom topography so that v v o this leads to δ v b o t ρ 1 ρ 2 0 and again to a negative volume integral of pv variation similarly an initial current with shallow region on its left would lead to a positive variation this is consistent with recent high resolution numerical results using free slip boundary conditions see molemaker et al 2015 gula et al 2015 vic et al 2015 gula et al 2019 2016 however as discussed above the important dynamical quantity is not necessarily the volume integral of pv the key quantity is the pva within an isopycnic layer we can diagnose the mean pva evolution within the boundary layer by dividing the volume integral of pv by the volume of the followed fluid or its area a 2d and a 2d in 2d see fig 7 when all isopycnic surfaces remain parallel this volume is constant as is the case in benthuysen and thomas 2012 for instance the mean pva is similar to the volume integral of pv and all previous results thus apply to the mean pva however when this is not the case the modification of pva is more complex and also involves pv dilution or concentration within a layer which respectively gains or loses mass see haynes and mcintyre 1990 morel and mcwilliams 2001 this process is effective whenever there exists variation of turbulence along the topography which is the case if the bottom slope or the velocity field vary spatially in addition global mass conservation requires that the depletion of one layer coincides with the inflation of another layer thus differential diapycnal mixing in bottom boundary layers is probably ubiquitous in realistic configurations and we can expect the creation of both positive and negative pv anomalies 6 summary and discussion 6 1 summary in the present paper we have used three different formulations of ertel pv in divergence form see schneider et al 2003 and eq 9 to calculate a volume integral of pv from the knowledge of physical fields at the surface encompassing the volume the divergence form and associated integral constraints have then been used to enable easier calculation of pv for numerical models also preserving the balances between boundary conditions and pv this has been explored in more details for specific physical processes at different scales we have also shown that the integral constraints associated with the divergence form lead to an easier calculation of the pv expression for non cartesian coordinate systems we have in particular illustrated this by calculating its expression in isopycnal coordinates for the general navier stokes equations we have then considered the volume integral of pv within a layer delimited by two isopycnic surfaces and their intersections with the ocean surface and bottom a general integral constraint was derived which allows to extend the pv impermeability theorem to no slip conditions provided there is no density mixing along the topography the integral constraint is then applied to several specific processes we first explored the link between volume integral of pv and surface fields at basin scale and we proposed an indicator to evaluate the time evolution of the volume integral of pv within a layer provided it outcrops at the sea surface section 5 1 we proposed an indicator i surf depending on physical fields at the surface as the signature of deeper pv the indicator can be easily calculated for models and compared to observations it depends on physical fields that can be estimated using satellite observations wind sea surface height surface temperature and salinity when applied to isolated vortices or jets given the equivalence between outcropping and surface pva concentration bretherton 1966 the balances indicate that such structures have opposite sign generalised pva and are thus potentially unstable it also provides a useful constraint to estimate pva structures from surface information as currently attempted empirically lapeyre et al 2006 lapeyre and klein 2006 lapeyre 2009 ponte et al 2013 wang et al 2013 fresnay et al 2018 we finally applied the integral constraints to the modification of pv by diabatic processes within the bottom boundary layer this provides a diagnostic of the pv evolution within a layer based on the displacement of its mean position and on the modification of the mean along slope velocity along the topography it shows in particular that free slip boundary conditions have potentially stronger effects on the formation of pva in the viscous boundary layer differential mixing variation of the density mixing along the topography also leads to additional and possibly opposite sign pva along the topography 6 2 discussion concerning the calculation of pv in numerical models the divergence form approach can be adapted to any type of grid including unstructured grids in numerical models the main problem is however lagrangian conservation of pv during the adiabatic evolution of the flow this principally relies on numerical schemes used in the model there exists debates on the optimality of numerical grids for instance between the charney phillips grid and the 3d c grid see arakawa and moorthi 1988 bell 2003 but a fair comparison relies on comparable numerical schemes too numerical schemes have to be optimised for the conservation of pv for each grid see winther et al 2007 when this is established the influence of the pv diagnostic on the conservation property is interesting to assess too even though this influence is expected to be marginal compared to numerical schemes concerning the i surf indicator we hypothesised that the time evolution of the integral of pv in a layer was mostly induced by the evolution of the surface fields recent studies ferrari et al 2016 mcdougall and ferrari 2017 de lavergne et al 2017 callies and ferrari 2018 have however shown that mixing is bottom intensified at large scale and that it is associated with strong upwelling downwelling circulations along the bottom topography which control the abyssal circulation overturning according to what is discussed here in section 5 4 this can also modify the average pv the signature of the modification of the deep pv on surface and bottom boundary terms of the pv balance eq 21 can be tested using numerical models deremble et al 2014 eq 14 can be used to calculate pv consistently with eq 21 an interesting perspective is to combine the present results with the water mass transformation wmt approach walin 1982 tziperman 1986 speer and tziperman 1992 if the surface contribution to the volume integral of pv can be exactly estimated for numerical models we have to rely on geostrophic and ekman currents for observations so that we may miss some important ageostrophic contributions to the surface current in particular associated with mixing the wmt theory allows one to estimate the surface drift associated with mixing and heat fluxes and correct the surface observations where needed the importance of this term for the pv balance can be assessed in models and the wmt approach provides a way to take this effect into account in observations concerning the dynamics of isolated vortices and jets the balances can be easily extended to take into account variations of density along the bottom variations of bottom density have then to be included in eqs 34 and 36 and a variable stratification at rest see eq b 6 in b this implies that the pva evaluation is also possibly influenced by the bottom conditions so that it may be difficult to reconstruct pva profiles from the knowledge of surface density anomalies alone our calculations used the f plane approximation on the β plane weak vortices are dispersed into rossby waves and their initial isolated nature can be rapidly lost the results we derive here are thus of interest mainly for coherent vortices whose pv structures is comprised of closed pv contours for these vortices we can neglect the variation of the coriolis parameter and rossby waves concerning modification of pv in the bottom boundary layer the net modification of pv is also a function of time benthuysen and thomas 2013 the velocity and stratification in the bottom boundary layer do not reach instantaneously their equilibrium value benthuysen and thomas 2012 thus the final modification of pv along a boundary depends on the time a fluid parcel will remain in contact with the boundary layer a lagrangian perspective shows that 3d effects are important for realistic conditions when a circulation encounters a bottom boundary a fluid parcel will be in contact with the boundary layer for a limited time period which is a function of the boundary and circulation shapes see fig 8 both frictional effects and diapycnal mixing will modify the pv value of the fluid parcel and the strength of the created pva which eventually separates from the boundary the identified processes for pv modification in the bottom boundary layer have physical grounds but their implementation in numerical simulations is a delicate issue as the result also depends on the choices of several parameters turbulent viscosity and diffusion but also numerical schemes boundary conditions and closure schemes for momentum and tracers in the bottom boundary layer further studies are needed to evaluate the respective strength of each process in numerical simulations and in nature the present results give exact diagnostics that can be helpful for

a d l where v is a finite volume v is its external surface and d s is an elementary surface oriented outward and is perpendicular to ω s is a surface s is its boundary and d l is an elementary line oriented parallel to s and in the trigonometric direction when s is seen from above see fig a 9 finally eqs a 1 and a 3 also give a 4 s ρ u d s s u ρ d s s ρ u d l all these integral properties allow the derivation of eq 10 and its alternative forms appendix b generalised constraints in nonuniform stratification b 1 generalised pv the definition of pv eq 2 could be changed and ρ can be replaced by

increasing function so that all the physics discussed in section 5 2 remains qualitatively valid 
24031,taking advantage of alternative expressions for potential vorticity pv in divergence forms we derive balances between volume integral of pv and boundary conditions that are then applied to practical computations of pv we propose a new method for diagnosing the ertel potential vorticity from model output that preserves the balances we show how the expression of pv can be derived in general coordinate systems this is here emphasised with isopycnic coordinates by generalising the pv expression to the general navier stokes equations we propose a generalised derivation for the haynes mcintyre impermeability theorem which highlights the role of the bottom boundary condition choice e g no slip vs free slip and mixing near the bottom boundary for the volume integral of pv the implications of balances between volume integral of pv and boundary conditions are then analysed for specific processes at various scales at large scale we show how an integral involving surface observations derived from satellite observations is linked to the integral of pv within a layer between two isopycnals this surface integral can be calculated for models and observations and can be used for validation at mesoscale or sub mesoscale we analyse the relationship between net pv anomalies and net surface density anomalies for idealised vortices and 2d fronts this can help determining vortex or jet structures for idealised studies or empirical methodologies we also confirm and integrate previous results on the modification of pv within a bottom boundary layer into a single diagnostic taking into account the effect of density and velocity modifications by diabatic processes along the topography and diapycnal mixing within the boundary layer keywords potential vorticity boundary conditions general circulation vortex fronts boundary layers 1 introduction it is well known that ertel s potential vorticity pv see ertel 1942 is an important quantity when studying the circulation at all scales in geophysical fluids the conservation property of pv in adiabatic evolution and the inversion principle the geostrophic velocity field can be inferred from the pv field and boundary conditions are key principles to interpret the ocean dynamics see hoskins et al 1985 mcwilliams 2006 and section 2 for more details conservation and inversion of pv are the basis of the quasigeostrophic qg model pedlosky 1987 that has been successfully used in pioneering studies aiming at understanding and modelling the ocean circulation from basin gyres rhines and young 1982a b luyten et al 1983 holland et al 1984 rhines 1986 talley 1988 marshall and nurser 1992 to current instabilities charney and stern 1962 geophysical turbulence mcwilliams 1984 and mesoscale dynamics mcwilliams and flierl 1979 sutyrin and flierl 1994 in the qg framework pv is related to the streamfunction by a linear elliptic differential operator pedlosky 1987 cushman roisin and beckers 2011 which has several important consequences first boundary conditions impose important dynamical constraints too in a qg framework bretherton 1966 has shown that surface or bottom outcropping of isopycnic surfaces is dynamically similar to a shallow layer of high pv anomaly in practice a dirac delta sheet whose strength can be related to the density anomaly this has led to the generalised surface quasigeostrophic sqg model held et al 1995 lapeyre 2017 lateral boundaries can be important too for the inversion of pv in the qg or sqg framework it has been shown that the velocity field away from a region of pv anomalies decreases slowly as the inverse of the distance from the region unless pv and surface density satisfy an integral constraint morel and mcwilliams 1997 assassi et al 2016 in models practical inversion of pv with given surface and bottom density fields is often done considering biperiodic domains lapeyre et al 2006 wang et al 2013 which can lead to discrepancies if the latter constraint is not satisfied second since the relationship between pv and the circulation is linear at first order qg and sqg the balance between smoothed averaged fields is preserved provided averaging is done using a linear convolution moreover pv concept is also useful for forced dissipative dynamics for instance diapycnal mixing does not change the volume integral of pv within a layer bounded by isopycnic surfaces which shows that pv can only be diluted or concentrated when the layer respectively gains or looses mass haynes and mcintyre 1987 1990 the influence of viscous surface or bottom stress on the pv evolution has also been analysed theoretically thomas 2005 taylor and ferrari 2010 benthuysen and thomas 2012 2013 thus the consequences of diabatic effects on the ocean dynamics can again be analysed and interpreted in terms of pv modification from basin scales see for instance hallberg and rhines 1996 2000 czaja and hausmann 2009 to meso and submesoscales see for instance morel and mcwilliams 2001 morel et al 2006 morel and thomas 2009 rossi et al 2010 meunier et al 2010 thomas et al 2013 molemaker et al 2015 gula et al 2019 2015 2016 vic et al 2015 giordani et al 2017 to conclude the ocean circulation and pv are linked and calculating pv at all scales under adiabatic or diabatic conditions is thus of considerable interest for geophysical fluid dynamics in qg or sqg models it is possible to ensure consistent balances between circulation pv and surface bottom and lateral boundary conditions from local to averaged fields in more complex models pv calculation involves many velocity and density derivatives in particular in non isopycnic models and keeping the link between averaged pv and averaged circulation implies to find a consistent calculation of pv if several studies have used diagnostics involving pv they remain rare and none have discussed the pv calculations in details in particular to evaluate if the relationships between pv and boundary conditions are maintained and if averaging can be done consistently the bretherton principle bretherton 1966 has been recently revisited and extended by schneider et al 2003 who generalised the concept of pv to take into account the dynamical effect of outcropping for the general navier stokes equations to do so they used the alternative divergence form for the expression of pv vallis 2006 in this paper we show how this divergence form of pv naturally leads to general constraints on volume balances of pv and boundary conditions section 3 these follow from the definition of pv and are independent of the dynamics adiabatic or diabatic of the flow in section 4 we show that the divergence form also makes pv computations easier and consistent in the sense that balances are automatically preserved when integrating pv a consequence of the divergence form we then propose several frameworks involving dynamics at different scales to discuss the generalised constraints between pv and surface bottom or lateral boundary conditions section 5 we summarise and discuss our results in the concluding section section 2 summarises basic definitions and properties of pv which are not new and can be skipped by readers familiar with pv 2 reminders on potential vorticity 2 1 definition of ertel potential vorticity ertel 1942 defined potential vorticity as 1 p v e r t e l u f ρ ρ u a ρ ρ where u is the fluid velocity field in the reference frame of the rotating earth ρ is the potential density in the ocean and entropy in the atmosphere u a u ω r is the absolute velocity where ω 0 ω y ω z is the rotation vector of the earth r is the position relative to the earth center and f 0 f y f z ω r 2 ω see fig 1 note that f is fixed but its components in some coordinate system spherical coordinates for instance can vary with position the minus sign on the left hand side of eq 1 is so that pv is generally positive for gravitationally stable low rossby number flows in the northern hemisphere in the ocean the boussinesq approximation is typically valid and ρ ρ can be replaced by ρ ρ 0 where ρ 0 is a mean oceanic density ρ 0 can then be omitted from the definition of pv and we can use 2 p v e r t e l u f ρ u a ρ we retain this definition for pv as it leads to clearer expressions for the calculations we present and the formulas we obtain this approximation is however not necessary and all the following results are valid provided ρ is replaced by g ρ log ρ see appendix b 2 2 properties 2 2 1 conservation the non hydrostatic navier stokes equations with boussinesq approximation are 3 d d t u f u p ρ 0 g ρ ρ 0 f d i v u 0 d d t ρ ρ where u u v w is the velocity field d d t ϕ t ϕ u ϕ f 0 f y f z is the coriolis vector p is the pressure ρ is the potential density and f f x f y f z and ρ are terms associated with diabatic processes for momentum and density fields the lagrangian evolution of ertel pv can be derived from eq 3 4 d d t p v e r t e l f ρ u f ρ as shown by ertel 1942 pv ertel is thus conserved in regions where diabatic processes are negligible the evolution conservation of pv following fluid particles is a major constraint for geophysical fluid dynamics hoskins et al 1985 to study geophysical fluids simplified forms of eq 3 are sought which conserve a simplified expression for pv white et al 2005 this is the case for instance for quasigeostrophic or primitive equations pedlosky 1987 cushman roisin and beckers 2011 mcwilliams 2006 for the primitive equations the hydrostatic approximation is assumed and f y is neglected pv can be written white et al 2005 5 p v p e x v y u f z z ρ z v x ρ z u y ρ where f z is the local vertical component of the coriolis vector and is called coriolis parameter the lagrangian conservation of pv pe is more conveniently derived and achieved in numerical models using density ρ instead of the geopotential vertical coordinate z this has been one of the motivation for the development of isopycnic coordinate ocean models see for instance bleck et al 1992 hallberg 1997 using isopycnic coordinate pv pe can be written cushman roisin and beckers 2011 6 p v p e ζ f z h where ζ x v y u ρ is the relative vorticity now calculated using horizontal velocity components along isopycnic surfaces and h ρ z is a measure of the local stratification we will see below how the expression of pv can be easily derived in isopycnic coordinates for the full navier stokes equations including terms coming from all components of the coriolis vector and non hydrostatic effects 2 2 2 inversion if cyclo geostrophy is assumed the velocity field and stratification can be calculated from the pv and are associated with the balanced dynamics hoskins et al 1985 davis and emanuel 1991 mcintyre and norton 2000 morel and mcwilliams 2001 herbette et al 2003 2005 the pv of a fluid at rest and with a horizontally homogeneous stratification is not null the potential vorticity anomaly pva is defined as the difference between total pv and a reference pv associated with a state of rest of the entire fluid 7 p v a p v p v r e s t pv a is the part of the pv that is linked to the balanced dynamics and at first order it corresponds to the quasigeostrophic pv davis and emanuel 1991 mcintyre and norton 2000 herbette et al 2003 the pv of the state at rest is given by the stratification at rest 8 p v r e s t f ρ ρ f z z ρ ρ f z ρ z ρ f z h an important point is that in eq 7 pva has to be calculated along surfaces of constant density this is underlined by the ρ symbol in eq 8 which is valid for both non hydrostatic and primitive equations the stratification at rest ρ is associated with the adiabatic rearrangement of the density to get a horizontally uniform field holliday and mcintyre 1981 kang and fringer 2010 and it is generally not easy to determine pva is thus often used in idealised configurations where the fluid is at rest in some area generally at the edge of the domain see sections 5 2 and 5 3 below alternatively pva can be associated with small scale processes superposed on a larger scale circulation the reference state can then be approximately determined as a spatial average over a distance that is much larger than the processes scales 3 alternative expressions for pv 3 1 divergence form in the following the calculations rely on general mathematical properties relating divergence curl and gradient of 3d fields and integral properties of these operators whose general forms are recalled in appendix a previous studies have shown that ertel pv as defined in eq 2 can be expressed in divergence form see schneider et al 2003 vallis 2006 trivial manipulations explained in appendix a see eq a 1 lead to the following equivalent expressions for the pv in divergence form remember u a u ω r is the absolute velocity see fig 1 9c p v e r t e l d i v u a ρ d i v ρ u a d i v u ρ d i v ρ f notice that these expressions are exact whatever the evolution diabatic or adiabatic of pv and have been reported and or used before in particular in atmospheric sciences see haynes and mcintyre 1987 bretherton and schar 1993 schneider et al 2003 vallis 2006 here we demonstrate that they also lead to consistent and convenient practical approach to calculating and analysing pv in ocean modelling 3 2 implication for the integral of pv using ostrogradsky stokes theorem see appendix a the previous divergence form of the pv simplifies the calculation of the integral of pv ertel over a volume v it can be calculated from the knowledge of the density velocity or relative vorticity fields around the surface v containing v eqs 9 give the exact expressions 10c v p v e r t e l d v v ρ u a d s v u a ρ d s v ρ f d s v u ρ d s the previous expressions follow from the definition of pv and do not depend on equations governing its evolution they represent exact instantaneous diagnostics of net pv within a volume and should not be confused with the general flux form of the pv evolution equation haynes and mcintyre 1987 4 applications to the calculation of pv in this section we discuss how the divergence formulation and its associated integral constraints eq 10 yield an easier way to diagnose pv and maintain balances between volume integral of pv and boundary conditions eq 10 4 1 pv diagnostics for numerical models the diagnosis of pv from numerical model outputs is generally cumbersome if the literal form eq 2 or eq 5 is chosen as it implies numerous gradients calculated at different grid points which then have to be averaged the use of the divergence form simplifies the pv calculation and also preserves eq 10 as they are used in the majority of ocean circulation models we consider a 3d c grid which are 3d extensions of the horizontal arakawa c grid see fig 2 and arakawa and lamb 1977 using cartesian coordinates we start from the divergence form of pv 9b rewritten as 11 p v e r t e l d i v ρ ζ f x ρ ζ x f x y ρ ζ y f y z ρ ζ z f z where ζ u and 12 ζ x y w z v ζ y x w z u ζ z x v y u the elementary cell for which pv is calculated has the density values at its corners see fig 2 as is clear from fig 2 ζ z values need to be calculated at the center of lower and upper sides of the cell it can be calculated using the circulation along edges of the cell lower and upper sides an interesting property of 3d c grid is that this is straightforward thanks to the position of the velocity points located at the middle of edges parallel to the velocity component density is averaged over the 4 density points located at the side corners the same calculation is also valid for the other sides of the cell as a result the pv of the cell can easily be calculated from physical fields within this single cell we get 13 ζ i j k x w i j k w i j 1 k δ y v i j k v i j k 1 δ z ζ i j k y w i j k w i 1 j k δ y u i j k u i j k 1 δ z ζ i j k z v i j k v i 1 j k δ x u i j k u i j 1 k δ y and finally 14 p v i j k ρ x i j k ζ i j k x f i j k x ρ x i 1 j k ζ i

the ζ i j k x y z points note that for the specific discretization of the 3d c grid see fig 2 the divergence form leads to a compact expression of pv in eq 14 pv is calculated using density and velocity values from a single grid cell eq 14 has a flux form which ensures that given a volume v the integral of pv calculated over v using the accumulation of individual cells or using eq 10 exactly match thus preserving the general balances between integral of pv and boundary conditions for any volume flux form pv expressions can be derived for b grids or other grids with a similar property 4 2 general pv expression in isopycnal coordinates the integral constraints 10 may be used for an easier derivation of the expression of pv in any coordinate systems and for the full navier stokes equations as an example we calculate pv using the isopycnic coordinate ρ instead of the geopotential coordinate z see section 4a of schneider et al 2003 this is of interest as the interpretation of the pv evolution in particular the pv anomaly has to be made along isopycnic surfaces hoskins et al 1985 for the sake of simplicity we just replace the vertical cartesian coordinate z by ρ and we keep the cartesian x y coordinates in the horizontal see fig 3 other systems for instance spherical can be used without much more complications we also keep the orthogonal cartesian elementary vectors i j k associated with axis ox oy oz see fig 3 to express all vectors in this framework z z x y ρ is the vertical position of isopycnic surfaces and to calculate pv we will use eq 10b which only requires the evaluation of the density gradient ρ x ρ i y ρ j z ρ k but using the x y ρ coordinates to do so we use h ρ z 1 z ρ x z y ρ h x ρ y z y z x ρ h y ρ x z the density gradient is then given by 16 ρ 1 h x z i y z j k eq 10b is then applied to an elementary volume bounded by two isopycnic surfaces sketched in fig 3 17 δ v p v e r t e l d v δ v u a ρ d s u a ρ d s δ v where δv is the flux through all surfaces delimiting δv note that u a u a i v a j w a k remains the absolute velocity field expressed in the orthogonal cartesian system since the flux across isopycnic surfaces ρ δρ is null and since the other surfaces are simple vertical planes of constant y or x eq 17 gives 18 p v e r t e l ρ δ v u a ρ i 2 δ y 2 h δ ρ x δ x x δ x u a ρ j 2 δ x 2 h δ ρ y δ y y δ y given that δv 2δx2δy 2δz 2δx 2δy 2hδρ and 19 u a ρ 1 h v a w a y z u a w a x z u a y z v a x z eq 18 gives 20 p v e r t e l ρ x v a w a y z ρ y u a w a x z ρ h x v w y z ρ y u w x z ρ f z f y y z h which is a generalised form of eq 6 with additional terms in particular all components of the coriolis effect the terms u w x z ρ v w y z ρ represent the projection of the velocity field on the plane tangent to the isopycnic surface this exact general result can also be derived using eq 2 with a change of coordinate but the calculations based on eq 10 offer a straightforward method 4 3 integration of pv in a layer we consider a volume v constituted of a layer embedded between two isopycnic surfaces associated with densities ρ 1 and ρ 2 that can outcrop at the surface or bottom see fig 4 the total pv contained within v may be deduced from eq 10c and trivial calculations taking advantage of the fact that the boundaries v of the layer are partly delimited by isentropic isopycnic surfaces and some rearrangements using eq a 4 this leads to the following form which depends only on physical fields at the surface and bottom outcropping regions 21 v p v e r t e l d v s s s b s w u ρ d s s s ρ 1 ρ s d s s b s w ρ 1 ρ b d s s ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 2 d s f where ρ s x y is the density at the ocean surface and ρ b x y the density along the bottom of the ocean this form takes advantage of the expression eq 10c to deal with volumes delimited by the two isopycnal surfaces s ρ 1 and s ρ 2 part of the layer boundaries are however associated with outcropping surfaces where density varies s s s w and s b see fig 4 the first right hand side term of eq 21 depends on u ρ and has to be evaluated along these surfaces for this term depending on the boundary condition used it may be more convenient to switch back to a form in ρ ζ like in eq 10a this has to be done carefully using eq a 4 see appendix a for instance we obtain for the surface s s 22 s s u ρ d s s s ρ 1 ρ s ζ s d x d y finally notice that the bottom surface has been divided in sidewalls and bottom regions s w and s b see fig 4 possibly associated with different boundary conditions this is artificial if both surfaces are associated with the seafloor but we did make a difference for the sake of generality for instance in academic configurations such as a rectangular basin boundary conditions at the walls and at the bottom can differ 4 4 impermeability theorem the impermeability theorem haynes and mcintyre 1987 1990 states that there is no net transport of pv across isopycnic or isentropic surfaces whatever the evolution as already shown by vallis 2006 eq 10b is a straightforward demonstration of this theorem indeed across such surfaces d s is parallel to ρ and eq 10b shows that they do not contribute to the calculation of the pv volume integral whatever the evolution of the isopycnic surfaces thus if there are no outcropping regions and the isopycnic surfaces are closed the volume integral of ertel pv within closed isopycnic surfaces is and remains null whatever the evolution alternatively modification of the volume integral of pv in an isopycnic layer is only possible when isopycnic surfaces outcrop haynes and mcintyre 1987 this principle can be slightly extended considering a layer without surface outcropping and considering a no slip boundary condition at the ocean bottom u w u b 0 eq 21 gives 23 v p v e r t e l d v s b s w ρ 1 ρ b d s s ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 2 d s f if u w u b 0 the density distribution along the bottom can only be modified by diabatic mixing effects along the bottom if the latter are negligible the density field along the bottom is constant and eq 23 then shows that there is no modification of the volume integral of pv indeed in this case both terms in the right hand side of eq 23 are constant this is obvious for the first term the second term is simply the scalar product of f constant and the net s ρ 2 surface vector the latter only depends on the position of the edge of the surface defined by the ρ 2 contour along the bottom and thus constant too an alternative way to demonstrate this is to transform the second term using eq a 4 see appenix a to conclude with no slip boundary conditions the volume integral of pv is only modified if there exists mixing of the density near the bottom in practice the free slip boundary condition is often preferred in ocean circulation models the implication for the generation of pv will be discussed below section 5 4 another case of interest is when outcropping only occurs at the surface and sidewalls fig 4 b in numerical models sidewalls are sometimes considered vertical and the f y component of the coriolis vector is also neglected so that f d s 0 if no slip boundary conditions are used many terms disappear in eq 21 and we then obtain 24 v p v e r t e l d v s s u ρ d s s s f z ρ 1 ρ s d s this draws attention to the potential importance of sloping boundaries and the f y component for the volume integral of pv at basin scale it also shows that the surface terms in eq 24 are of special interest and we further evaluate their contributions in the next section 5 applications to specific balances as discussed in the introduction there exists a strong link between ocean circulation and the pv field from mesoscale eddies to large scale currents eq 21 shows that there exists a balance between a volume integral of pv and boundary conditions using the divergence form of pv and the local pv calculation discussed in section 4 1 allows to preserve this balance this is important for the physical interpretation of model outputs in terms of pv in this section we illustrate how the balance can be used at several scales and for various processes in realistic or idealised configurations for which some terms in eq 21 can be easily evaluated from observations e g the surface ones simplified or neglected e g for no slip boundary conditions in section 5 1 we discuss how time variations of large scale volume integral of pv can be related to surface fields for both models and observations at mesoscale surface density anomalies play a role similar to pva bretherton 1966 in sections 5 2 and 5 3 we show how eq 21 can be applied to isolated vortices and jets we show that the balance leads to a precise relationship between surface density anomalies and pva integrals which has to be satisfied for isolated vortices and jets finally in section 5 4 we show how eq 21 can be applied to study the modification of pv in the bottom boundary layer underlining the strong impact of the boundary conditions free no slip 5 1 surface outcropping regions as indicators of the circulation of deep layers for some choices of boundary conditions eq 21 reduces to eq 24 in addition pv can be quickly modified by diabatic processes at the surface thomas 2005 morel et al 2006 thomas and ferrari 2008 thomas et al 2013 wenegrat et al 2018 we can thus hypothesise that the surface term i s u r f s s ρ 1 ρ s f u ρ s d s dominates the time evolutions of the integral of pv within a deeper layer which is itself linked to modification of the circulation rhines and young 1982a b luyten et al 1983 holland et al 1984 rhines 1986 thomas and rhines 2002 polton and marshall 2003 deremble et al 2014 comparing i surf from numerical models and observations is thus of interest using d s k d x d y where k is the vertical elementary vector i surf can be rewritten 25 i s u r f s s ρ 1 ρ s f u ρ s k d x d y note that the integral in eq 25 only requires the knowledge of surface fields in particular u ρ s k only depends on the horizontal gradient of the surface density i surf can be calculated directly for numerical models for observations satellite observations possibly complemented by in situ surface drifter observations provide good estimates of the surface circulation over most of the ocean down to scales of order 25 km see for instance sudre and morrow 2008 abernathey and marshall 2013 rio et al 2014 to do so the surface current is split into a geostrophic component and a component induced by the wind stress 26 u s u g e o u τ the geostrophic component u g e o and the associated relative vorticity can be calculated from the knowledge of the sea surface height ssh observed by satellite altimetry 27 u g e o g f z k s s h the wind induced surface current can be evaluated from satellite scatterometer observations and using the wind induced ekman spiral which gives see cushman roisin and beckers 2011 28 u τ τ w π 4 f z ν where ν is the turbulent eddy viscosity and 29 τ w π 4 ρ a ρ o c d w w π 4 where w π 4 is the surface wind but whose orientation has been rotated by π 4 ρ a ρ o is the ratio of the air to ocean density and c d 3 10 3 is the turbulent transfer parameter as a result the surface term contributing to the calculation of the observed pv within a layer eq 25 can be written 30 i s u r f s s ρ 1 ρ s f z g f z k s s h ρ a c d w w π 4 ρ o f z ν ρ s k d x d y and can be calculated from the observed sea surface density calculated using sss and sst from smos aquarius and microwave satellite observations ssh and surface wind all fields generally available over most of the ocean at 1 4 resolution we believe the comparison of i surf from numerical models eq 25 and from observations eq 30 can provide an interesting new diagnostic for the validation of global or basin scale numerical models 5 2 constraints for coherent isolated vortices most observed eddies in the ocean are isolated 1 1 an isolated vortex has a velocity field that decreases more rapidly than 1 r where r is the distance from its center and the horizontal integral of its vorticity is null at any level chelton et al 2011 in qg and sqg models for coherent isolated vortices the volume integral of pva and surface density field are linked morel and mcwilliams 1997 assassi et al 2016 we here extend this balance to ertel pva consider a flat earth for which f 0 0 f z f plane approximation and an axisymmetric vortex over a flat bottom see fig 5 b d for the sake of simplicity we also hypothesise that ρ is constant at the bottom and that p v r e s t is spatially uniform linear stratification at rest integrating the pva over the control volume v o see fig 5 b d gives 31 v o p v a d v v o p v e r t e l p v r e s t d v v o f ρ p v r e s t d v v o u ρ d v by using that p v r e s t f z ρ s ρ b h eq a 1b and the fact that the vortex is isolated we get 32 v o f ρ p v r e s t d v s s ρ s ρ s f z d x d y and 33 v o u ρ d v v o ρ u d s s s ρ s ζ s u r f d x d y o 1 r s s ρ s ρ s ζ s u r f d x d y o 1 r where ζ surf x v y u is the relative vorticity at the surface ρ s is the surface density at rest or the surface density far from the vortex center and ρ s ρ s is the surface density anomaly associated with the vortex 2 2 in eq 33 the last line is obtained since s s ζ d x d y 0 for isolated vortices the o 1 r term accounts for the integration over the bottom and lateral boundaries dashed contours in fig 5 in particular the lateral contribution scales as ρh 2π r z u r o 1 r the o 1 r rate of decrease is symbolic and the term simply indicates that these contributions vanish when r integration of eq 31 over the whole infinite domain shows that pv anomalies associated with isolated vortices have to satisfy 34 p v a d v s s ρ s ρ s ζ s u r f f z d x d y 0 this extends the integral constraints found in assassi et al 2016 which is modified for strong surface vorticity when ζ surf f z 3 3 strictly speaking strong anticyclonic vortices for which ζ surf f z could even reverse the sign of the deep pva but these structures are subject to inertial instability and are not long lived structures this is the case for submesoscale vortices lapeyre et al 2006 klein et al 2008 capet et al 2008 roullet et al 2012 gula et al 2015 molemaker et al 2015 capet et al 2016 thus for isolated vortices a positive surface density anomaly is accompanied with negative pva a positive surface density is equivalent to a positive dirac delta sheet of pva bretherton 1966 a similar constraint holds for a negative density anomaly hence the generalised pva structure of isolated vortices has both positive and negative values which implies opposite sign pv gradient and opens the possibility of barotropic baroclinic instabilities charney and stern 1962 ripa 1991 this has an impact on the evolution stability and displacement of the vortex see morel and mcwilliams 1997 in idealised studies dealing with the dynamics of isolated vortices instability of the initial vortex structure can spoil the analysis and it is preferential to use specific methods based on the inversion of stable pv structures to initialise isolated vortices in models see herbette et al 2003 moreover the constraint eq 34 can have implications for methodologies deriving velocity fields of vortices from surface density observations the methodologies empirically generate pva distributions based on large scale pv distributions or statistical correlations between surface density observations and pva lapeyre et al 2006 lapeyre and klein 2006 lapeyre 2009 ponte et al 2013 wang et al 2013 fresnay et al 2018 in general the derived pva distributions do not satisfy constraint 34 the consequence is that the velocity field of a reconstructed vortex decreases slowly which can lead to spurious calculations near lateral boundaries the methodologies often consider periodic boundary conditions it could be interesting to modify the methodologies so as to satisfy eq 34 in the vicinity of each vortex we however have no clue on the spatial distribution of the pva from the constraint pva poles crown vertically aligned or not vertical position within the water column possibly multiple poles of opposite sign and the reconstruction of the vertical vortex pva have thus to be done carefully 5 3 constraints for jets and surface fronts similar constraints can be found for density fronts associated with jet like currents we consider a 2d configuration with no variation in the y direction in 2d eq 10 becomes 35 s p v e r t e l d s s ρ u a n d l s u a ρ n d l s ρ f n d l s u ρ n d l consider a 2d front outcropping at the surface but with a constant density along a flat bottom see fig 6 the velocity field can be written u v x z j where v is the velocity component along the y axis for jet like currents the velocity vanishes away from the front v x z 0 the stratification is different on both sides of the front and varies from ρ z to ρ z for this configuration the determination of the reference pv associated with the state at rest is slightly more delicate as we hypothesised that both the left and right edges of the front are at rest it has however to be chosen at the left edge as only this side covers the entire density range the reference pv is thus p v r e s t and we then integrate pva from x to x l again for the sake of simplification we hypothesise that f 0 0 f z and p v r e s t is spatially uniform trivial manipulations yield an equation similar to eq 33 36 s p v a d s s p v e r t e l p v r e s t d s x l ρ ρ z 0 ζ z f z z 0 d x z h z 0 z ρ v x l d z assuming the velocity has a jet like structure v x l z becomes small enough so that the last term in eq 36 can be neglected given the density structure discussed here see fig 6 ρ ρ z 0 is positive which shows that a negative pva must exist below the outcropping region for jets if ζ z f z remains positive opposite sign generalised pva is necessarily associated with opposite sign pva gradients and to instability charney and stern 1962 similarly to isolated vortices integral constraint 36 can be useful to study the instability of surface fronts and for methods aiming at reconstructing the ocean at mesoscale and submesoscale via an estimation of pva within the water column lapeyre et al 2006 ponte et al 2013 spall 1995 boss et al 1996 manucharyan and timmermans 2013 5 4 pv modification by bottom boundary layer processes to study the modification of pv by necessarily diabatic processes eq 4 complemented with the knowledge of diabatic terms is needed benthuysen and thomas 2012 molemaker et al 2015 gula et al 2019 2015 however as shown next integral constraints may provide an interesting way to monitor the pv evolution within an isopycnic layer intersecting the topography to do so let us consider the development of a bottom boundary layer in 2d with no variation in the y direction fig 7 we also consider that there is no outcropping at the surface and we follow a control area a 2d bounded by two isopycnic surfaces ρ 1 and ρ 2 the topography and a vertical boundary located at a distance l sufficiently large so that we can consider being away from the boundary layer and unaffected by the diabatic processes the stratification and velocity field are unchanged see fig 7 integration of pv over this area gives see eq 35 37 a 2 d p v e r t e l d a s w ρ 1 ρ b n d l s ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 2 n d l f s w u ρ n d l s v z ρ d z given its definition the last term in eq 37 does not vary the isopycnic levels initially intersect the topography at x 0 and x l and along the topography the velocity field is v o j fig 7a after some diabatic processes involving the viscous boundary layer and diapycnal mixing the velocity profile and the position of isopycnic surfaces are modified the positions of the intersection with the topography are now x l 1 and x l 2 and the velocity field along the topography is v j fig 7b some trivial manipulations give 38 s w ρ 1 ρ b n f d l f z l 1 l 2 ρ 1 ρ b d x s ρ 2 ρ 1 ρ 2 n f d l f z ρ 2 ρ 1 l l 2 s w u ρ n d l ρ 1 ρ 2 v d ρ assuming a linear variation of the density along the bottom topography this gives for the initial condition see fig 7 39 a 2 d p v e r t e l d a f z ρ 2 ρ 1 l l 2 v o ρ 2 ρ 1 s v z ρ d z and after the diabatic modification 40 a 2 d p v e r t e l d a f z ρ 2 ρ 1 l l 1 l 2 2 v ρ 2 ρ 1 s v z ρ d z where v is the mean velocity along the bottom topography where the average is weighted by density the net modification of the volume integral of pv within the layer is thus 41 δ l a y e r p v ρ 2 ρ 1 f z δ x b o t ρ 1 ρ 2 ρ 2 ρ 1 δ v b o t ρ 1 ρ 2 where δ v b o t ρ 1 ρ 2 v v o is the modification of the mean velocity field along the bottom and within the layer ρ 1 ρ 2 and δ x b o t ρ 1 ρ 2 l 1 l 2 l 2 is the modification of the mean x position of the layer along the bottom if no slip conditions are chosen at the bottom we recover that only density mixing along the bottom can modify the volume integral of pv within a layer as already discussed in section 4 4 the time evolution of the volume integral of pv then only depends on the variation of the position of the intersection of the isopycnic layer it is negative if the layer goes downslope destratification case as illustrated in fig 7 and positive if the layer goes upslope restratification case our results are qualitatively consistent with benthuysen and thomas 2012 despite the fact that we consider a layer and not a fixed box for the volume integral of pv eq 41 allows the possibility to consider free slip bottom conditions free slip boundary conditions is the constraint usually used in numerical models and can provide an additional modification of the volume integral of pv if viscous effects are considered as first imagined by d asaro 1988 these viscous effects have to be added to the effect of the modification of density studied in benthuysen and thomas 2012 and discussed above eq 41 shows that they superimpose when calculating the volume integral of pv and generally act similarly since our results are only diagnostics we have to imagine the evolution of the velocity and density fields along the boundary to evaluate the possible pv modification if we consider a velocity field with the shallow region on its right v o 0 as depicted in fig 7 in the northern hemisphere the bottom friction develops a downslope ekman flux that leads to destratification and mixing induces a negative volume integral of pv variation we can also assume that bottom friction also acts so as to reduce the strength of the velocity along the bottom topography so that v v o this leads to δ v b o t ρ 1 ρ 2 0 and again to a negative volume integral of pv variation similarly an initial current with shallow region on its left would lead to a positive variation this is consistent with recent high resolution numerical results using free slip boundary conditions see molemaker et al 2015 gula et al 2015 vic et al 2015 gula et al 2019 2016 however as discussed above the important dynamical quantity is not necessarily the volume integral of pv the key quantity is the pva within an isopycnic layer we can diagnose the mean pva evolution within the boundary layer by dividing the volume integral of pv by the volume of the followed fluid or its area a 2d and a 2d in 2d see fig 7 when all isopycnic surfaces remain parallel this volume is constant as is the case in benthuysen and thomas 2012 for instance the mean pva is similar to the volume integral of pv and all previous results thus apply to the mean pva however when this is not the case the modification of pva is more complex and also involves pv dilution or concentration within a layer which respectively gains or loses mass see haynes and mcintyre 1990 morel and mcwilliams 2001 this process is effective whenever there exists variation of turbulence along the topography which is the case if the bottom slope or the velocity field vary spatially in addition global mass conservation requires that the depletion of one layer coincides with the inflation of another layer thus differential diapycnal mixing in bottom boundary layers is probably ubiquitous in realistic configurations and we can expect the creation of both positive and negative pv anomalies 6 summary and discussion 6 1 summary in the present paper we have used three different formulations of ertel pv in divergence form see schneider et al 2003 and eq 9 to calculate a volume integral of pv from the knowledge of physical fields at the surface encompassing the volume the divergence form and associated integral constraints have then been used to enable easier calculation of pv for numerical models also preserving the balances between boundary conditions and pv this has been explored in more details for specific physical processes at different scales we have also shown that the integral constraints associated with the divergence form lead to an easier calculation of the pv expression for non cartesian coordinate systems we have in particular illustrated this by calculating its expression in isopycnal coordinates for the general navier stokes equations we have then considered the volume integral of pv within a layer delimited by two isopycnic surfaces and their intersections with the ocean surface and bottom a general integral constraint was derived which allows to extend the pv impermeability theorem to no slip conditions provided there is no density mixing along the topography the integral constraint is then applied to several specific processes we first explored the link between volume integral of pv and surface fields at basin scale and we proposed an indicator to evaluate the time evolution of the volume integral of pv within a layer provided it outcrops at the sea surface section 5 1 we proposed an indicator i surf depending on physical fields at the surface as the signature of deeper pv the indicator can be easily calculated for models and compared to observations it depends on physical fields that can be estimated using satellite observations wind sea surface height surface temperature and salinity when applied to isolated vortices or jets given the equivalence between outcropping and surface pva concentration bretherton 1966 the balances indicate that such structures have opposite sign generalised pva and are thus potentially unstable it also provides a useful constraint to estimate pva structures from surface information as currently attempted empirically lapeyre et al 2006 lapeyre and klein 2006 lapeyre 2009 ponte et al 2013 wang et al 2013 fresnay et al 2018 we finally applied the integral constraints to the modification of pv by diabatic processes within the bottom boundary layer this provides a diagnostic of the pv evolution within a layer based on the displacement of its mean position and on the modification of the mean along slope velocity along the topography it shows in particular that free slip boundary conditions have potentially stronger effects on the formation of pva in the viscous boundary layer differential mixing variation of the density mixing along the topography also leads to additional and possibly opposite sign pva along the topography 6 2 discussion concerning the calculation of pv in numerical models the divergence form approach can be adapted to any type of grid including unstructured grids in numerical models the main problem is however lagrangian conservation of pv during the adiabatic evolution of the flow this principally relies on numerical schemes used in the model there exists debates on the optimality of numerical grids for instance between the charney phillips grid and the 3d c grid see arakawa and moorthi 1988 bell 2003 but a fair comparison relies on comparable numerical schemes too numerical schemes have to be optimised for the conservation of pv for each grid see winther et al 2007 when this is established the influence of the pv diagnostic on the conservation property is interesting to assess too even though this influence is expected to be marginal compared to numerical schemes concerning the i surf indicator we hypothesised that the time evolution of the integral of pv in a layer was mostly induced by the evolution of the surface fields recent studies ferrari et al 2016 mcdougall and ferrari 2017 de lavergne et al 2017 callies and ferrari 2018 have however shown that mixing is bottom intensified at large scale and that it is associated with strong upwelling downwelling circulations along the bottom topography which control the abyssal circulation overturning according to what is discussed here in section 5 4 this can also modify the average pv the signature of the modification of the deep pv on surface and bottom boundary terms of the pv balance eq 21 can be tested using numerical models deremble et al 2014 eq 14 can be used to calculate pv consistently with eq 21 an interesting perspective is to combine the present results with the water mass transformation wmt approach walin 1982 tziperman 1986 speer and tziperman 1992 if the surface contribution to the volume integral of pv can be exactly estimated for numerical models we have to rely on geostrophic and ekman currents for observations so that we may miss some important ageostrophic contributions to the surface current in particular associated with mixing the wmt theory allows one to estimate the surface drift associated with mixing and heat fluxes and correct the surface observations where needed the importance of this term for the pv balance can be assessed in models and the wmt approach provides a way to take this effect into account in observations concerning the dynamics of isolated vortices and jets the balances can be easily extended to take into account variations of density along the bottom variations of bottom density have then to be included in eqs 34 and 36 and a variable stratification at rest see eq b 6 in b this implies that the pva evaluation is also possibly influenced by the bottom conditions so that it may be difficult to reconstruct pva profiles from the knowledge of surface density anomalies alone our calculations used the f plane approximation on the β plane weak vortices are dispersed into rossby waves and their initial isolated nature can be rapidly lost the results we derive here are thus of interest mainly for coherent vortices whose pv structures is comprised of closed pv contours for these vortices we can neglect the variation of the coriolis parameter and rossby waves concerning modification of pv in the bottom boundary layer the net modification of pv is also a function of time benthuysen and thomas 2013 the velocity and stratification in the bottom boundary layer do not reach instantaneously their equilibrium value benthuysen and thomas 2012 thus the final modification of pv along a boundary depends on the time a fluid parcel will remain in contact with the boundary layer a lagrangian perspective shows that 3d effects are important for realistic conditions when a circulation encounters a bottom boundary a fluid parcel will be in contact with the boundary layer for a limited time period which is a function of the boundary and circulation shapes see fig 8 both frictional effects and diapycnal mixing will modify the pv value of the fluid parcel and the strength of the created pva which eventually separates from the boundary the identified processes for pv modification in the bottom boundary layer have physical grounds but their implementation in numerical simulations is a delicate issue as the result also depends on the choices of several parameters turbulent viscosity and diffusion but also numerical schemes boundary conditions and closure schemes for momentum and tracers in the bottom boundary layer further studies are needed to evaluate the respective strength of each process in numerical simulations and in nature the present results give exact diagnostics that can be helpful for

24032,the leeuwin current system lcs consists of the leeuwin current lc a surface poleward current along the west coast of australia the leeuwin undercurrent luc a subsurface equatorward current on the continental slope beneath the lc and zonal flows in the interior ocean that interact with the lc and luc to understand the three dimensional structure of the lcs circulation we construct a mean flow over twenty years in z coordinates and density coordinates from three day snapshots of an eddy resolving ocean general circulation model ogcm and carry out a leak free volume budget analysis on the mean flow field in both coordinate systems the mean flow in z coordinates forms a zonal and a meridional overturning where a near surface eastward flow enters the lc flows poleward and at the same time sinks to the luc depths flows equatorward and finally moves westward out of the lcs as found in a previous study on the other hand the mean flow in density coordinates is mostly isopycnic except that the upper part of the lc becomes denser as it flows poleward partly owing to sea surface cooling the lower part of the lc becomes denser not because of cooling but because denser water joins the lc from the interior ocean the luc becomes lighter as it flows equatorward because its lower part flows westward out of the lcs and its top part is joined by eastward flows from the interior the mean downwelling in z coordinates is therefore isopycnic and is likely a result of temporal variability keywords leeuwin current leeuwin undercurrent eddy resolving ogcm volume budget diapycnal flux residual mean circulation 1 introduction 1 1 description of the lcs the leeuwin current lc is a narrow current that flows poleward on the shelf break along the west coast of australia over the top 200m and the leeuwin undercurrent luc flows equatorward on the continental slope below the lc and extending from 200m to 800 m e g domingues et al 2007 woo and pattiaratchi 2008 furue et al 2017 and references therein offshore interior flows interact with these boundary currents see below and together they form the leeuwin current system lcs this is a follow on paper to furue et al 2017 hereafter f17 and as such the present introduction serves only to establish a minimal context for the present study the reader is refer to the introduction of f17 which includes broader background information about the lcs and cites other papers that include excellent reviews 1 1 1 leeuwin current the lc starts as a narrow coastal current from 22 s north west cape its main sources are southward or southeastward flows from the interior ocean and in austral autumn a southwestward current along the northwest coast of australia the holloway current also joins the head of the lc domingues et al 2007 d adamo et al 2009 further south eastward flows seem to join or impinge on the lc domingues et al 2007 waite et al 2007 meuleners et al 2008 menezes et al 2014 f17 mesoscale eddy activity is strong in this region and the lc is sometimes disrupted by eddies feng et al 2005 waite et al 2007 meuleners et al 2008 moreover semi stationary mesoscale recirculations interact with the lc in long term 10 20yr averages of eddy resolving ocean general circulation model ogcm solutions and in a geostrophic calculation derived from a gridded climatological hydrography f17 the lc flows around the southwest corner of australia cape leeuwin 34 s and continues on the shelf break along the south coast of australia e g cresswell and peterson 1993 duran et al and references therein 1 1 2 leeuwin undercurrent the luc exists between 200m and 800 m most part of the flinders current fc a northern boundary current of the subtropical gyre flowing westward extending from the sea surface to 2000 m along the south coast of australia middleton and cirano 2002 continues westward past the southwest corner of australia cape leeuwin 34 s but a small fraction of it bends equatorward to form the luc at cape leeuwin woo and pattiaratchi 2008 batteen and miller 2009 duran 2015 another small fraction of the fc retroflects eastward and joins the luc to the north of cape leeuwin duran 2015 f17 as it flows equatorward the core of the luc seems to migrate to lighter density although its upper bound stays at 200 m f17 mesoscale eddies and eddy like semi stationary recirculations interact with the luc as it flows equatorward on the continental slope meuleners et al 2008 f17 at 23 22 s the luc bends offshore to leave the continental slope duran 2015 f17 apparently following the southern flank of the exmouth plateau although the top of the plateau is deeper than the bottom of the luc duran 2015 1 1 3 downwelling and zonal overturning one striking difference of the eastern south indian ocean from the other eastern subtropical oceans is the large poleward sea level drop godfrey and ridgway 1985 maximenko and niiler 2005 associated with this drop is a near surface eastward geostrophic flow schott and mccreary 2001 and references therein which is broken up into narrower jet like flows domingues et al 2007 menezes et al 2014 f17 this flow generally extends to 200 m depth domingues et al 2007 menezes et al 2014 f17 despite the offshore westward ekman drift the net transport is generally onshore in the upper 200m which tends to accelerate the lc domingues et al 2007 f17 as it flows eastward the near surface water tends to downwell in this region domingues et al 2007 this tendency is consistent with the fact that the subtropical subduction zone extends close to australia schott et al 2002 in addition much stronger downwelling has been reported in or near the lc domingues et al 2007 f17 f17 set up two control volumes boxes that follow the outlines of the lc and luc and calculated volume fluxes across the faces of the boxes using a geostrophic velocity field based on a gridded hydrographical climatology they also carried out the same calculation on the long term averaged velocity field of an eddy resolving ogcm they found that a large fraction of the eastward volume flux that enters the lc box from the interior ocean sinks into the luc box instead of accelerating the lc and then exits the luc westward out of the offshore edge of the luc box thus forming a zonal overturning circulation their fig 12 domingues et al 2007 released lagrangian particles in their eddy permitting ogcm and found that some of their near surface particles gradually sink as they flow eastward and some of them join the lc and start to flow poleward and some sink deep enough to directly join the luc and start to flow equatorward before flowing back westward out of the luc the latter particles thus form a zonal overturning cell but the cell appears slightly different from f17 s where the eastward flux first enters the lc box before sinking to the luc depth see also furue et al 2018a 1 1 4 watermass properties the interior eastward flow that joins the lc is also consistent with the watermass properties the low salinity low s high oxygen high o source water of the lc is gradually overwhelmed by the high s indian central water icw woo and pattiaratchi 2008 the core of the luc consists of the high o subantarctic mode water which forms south of australia and is carried westward by the flinders current woo and pattiaratchi 2008 whether the icw is found in the upper part of the luc is debated the downwelling from the lc box into the luc box in f17 or domingues et al s 2007 pathway of near surface water joining the luc would suggest that the upper part of the luc should include some icw f17 also explained the northward migration of the luc core to lighter density as due to the additional lighter water from the lc layer on the other hand woo and pattiaratchi 2008 did not find icw there 1 2 present study it is not clear how the zonal overturning cell works if the icw joins the lc and sinks to the luc level as indicated by f17 s volume budget analysis or if some near surface water directly joins the luc as suggested by some of domingues et al s 2007 lagrangian particles the water must be found at the top of the luc is this a major pathway of the interior water another important and interesting question is how much diapycnal mixing is necessary for this downwelling the overturning pathway as described above appears to be crossing mean isopycnal surfaces the mean isopycnals however have a complex three dimensional structure and may allow for a mean downward along isopycnal motions it is also possible that temporal variability presumably due to mesoscale eddies may result in mean vertical volume flux without diapycnal flux to address these questions we analyze a high frequency output from an eddy resolving ogcm we calculate volume fluxes in density coordinates to separate isopycnal and diapycnal transports the frequency of the output must be high enough to resolve intrinsic temporal variabilities in the model the fastest of which for our spatial resolution is presumably that associated with mesoscale eddies otherwise spurious diapycnal flux would be diagnosed hazeleger et al 2003 this paper is organized as follows the next section describes the ogcm and a hydrographic dataset the latter used to validate the ogcm and then discusses the methods of analyses section 3 describes the three dimensional structure of the mean flow first in z coordinates and then in density coordinates finally section 4 summarizes and discusses the results the supplementary material provides technical details which section 2 only summarizes 2 data and methods 2 1 numerical model the ogcm we use is that of masumoto et al 2004 sasaki et al 2006 and sasaki et al 2008 and is called ofes for ogcm for the earth simulator which is a variant of the modular ocean model version 3 mom3 pacanowski and griffies 2000 detailed descriptions of ofes are found in the above three references and in furue et al 2018b here we only discuss the most important aspects of the model for the present study the computational domain is semi global extending from 7 5 s to 7 5 n with a horizontal grid spacing of 1 1 0 and there are 54 levels in the vertical with the grid spacing increasing from 5m at the sea surface to 15m at 200 m depth then to about 140m at 1000 m and finally to 330m at the maximum depth of 6065m the model topography is based on a 1 30 bathymetry dataset from the occam project webb et al 1997 1998 the model uses partial bottom cells pacanowski and gnanadesikan 1998 pacanowski and griffies 2000 to follow the actual bottom as closely as possible at the given horizontal resolution the horizontal mixing is parameterized with a two dimensional biharmonic operator semtner and mintz 1977 and the vertical mixing with the kpp scheme large et al 1994 our data is a set of three day snapshots from the ncep run described in detail by sasaki et al 2008 data publicly available from http apdrc soest hawaii edu the model has been integrated from 1950 to 2017 so far under daily mean forcings based on atmospheric variables from the ncep ncar reanalysis kalnay et al 1996 we use the twenty years from 1993 to 2012 to compare the model with the cars aus8 gridded hydrographic climatology see below which is based on hydrographic profiles including argo up to the end of 2012 2 2 gridded hydrography we use a gridded t s climatology called cars aus8 which is a regional high resolution version of cars csiro atlas of regional seas ridgway et al 2002 dunn and ridgway 2002 http www cmar csiro au cars http www marine csiro au atlas cars aus8 maps historical hydrographic profiles from 1950 to the end of 2012 onto a 1 8 grid and is designed to resolve longshore currents around australia using a terrain aware anisotropic smoothing interpolation technique ridgway et al 2002 dunn and ridgway 2002 f17 and duran et al applied a geostrophic calculation to this dataset and showed that it indeed resolves the climatological flow field of the lcs and the similar narrow coastal current system along the south coast of australia in the present paper we briefly compare the ogcm flow field with f17 s geostrophic velocity derived from cars aus8 the geostrophic calculation is referenced to 900 m where the ocean is deeper than 900 m but in the shallower ocean the unknown barotropic velocity is adjusted in such a way as to eliminate volume flux through the ocean bottom 2 3 coordinate system following the lcs to define and visualize the zonal and meridional circulation associated with the lcs we introduce a curved surface x x w y which is independent of z like a curtain and is designed to follow the offshore outline of both lc and luc for a visual aid see fig 2 below as in f17 we locate the position of the 200 m isobath x x z200 y off the west coast of australia between 34 s and 22 s and define x w y to be 0 8 west of the isobath x w y x z200 y 0 8 at many latitudes the mean lc extends somewhat onshore of the shelf break see below and we define its inshore edge to be x e y x z200 y 0 1 the bottom topography we refer to is that of the numerical model section 2 1 when determining x w and x e for the numerical model we choose for each latitude the gridbox whose bottom is the closest to 200 m instead of finding the x coordinate of 200 m depth by zonal interpolation so that x w and x e exactly follow edges of gridboxes see fig 1 below this definition allows for an exact calculation of volume budgets deshayes et al 2014 see supplement s 3 for technical details a minor inconvenience is that some zonal integrals and averages include gridscale noise e g fig 3 b below in f17 an additional curve was used to delineate the offshore edge of the luc which was located slightly offshore of the curve x w because the luc tends to be located slightly offshore of the lc the difference between the two curves however was not essential in f17 the vertical volume transport was strongest near the inshore edge of the luc box where its upper surface is shared by the bottom surface of the lc box and the volume transport across that portion of the upper surface of the luc box which is not shared was minor in the present study we therefore use x x w y to delineate both lc and luc as can be seen below fig 1 below the curve fits both currents fairly well the vertical extents of the mean lc and luc are relatively constant in the latitudinal direction shown later in fig 2 and we set the nominal bottoms of the lc and luc to be at d 1 200 m and d b 900 m respectively as in f17 the depth 900m is well beyond the bottom of the luc and therefore was a good choice of the level of no motion in f17 in density coordinates however the vertical boundary between the mean lc and luc significantly changes in the latitudinal direction the densities of the lc change much and those of the luc somewhat shown later in fig 5 for convenience we set ρ 1 26 σ θ and ρ b 27 σ θ as nominal upper and lower boundaries of the luc to visualize the x z circulation associated with the lcs we shift the variables in the zonal direction at each latitude in such a way that x w y becomes a straight meridional line along 113 s for convenience while the actual meridional average of the unshifted x w y is 112 95 e 2 4 isopycnal and diapycnal transports here we summarize a formulation to construct the three dimensional structure of the flow in density coordinates details are found in supplement s 1 the formulation is based on temporal residual mean trm and thickness weighted average twa quantities e g mcdougall and mcintosh 1996 aiki and yamagata 2006 young 2012 it has been used mostly to understand or interpret the impacts of mesoscale eddies in large scale circulation e g aiki and yamagata 2006 or to parameterize them in coarse resolution ogcms e g gent et al 1995 this study on the other hand focuses on diagnosing mean diapycnal volume flux and on constructing a three dimensional view of the mean lcs circulation in density coordinates our formulation is specifically designed for that purpose and in particular it calculates exact volume transports from the discrete velocity field of the numerical model deshayes et al 2014 supplement s 3 we integrate the horizontal velocity from the bottom upward at each point x y for each snapshot for each t 1 u d z d z u we sometimes use a complementary quantity which is the integral from z to the sea surface u z u 0 u z the volume transport below an arbitrary density surface ρ 1 can be calculated from 2 u z ρ 1 d z ρ 1 d z u for each x y t by finding the depth z ρ 1 at which ρ ρ 1 we basically carry out this calculation for each x y t and then take its temporal average to obtain the mean transport below the isopycnal ρ 1 if we need to know the mean transport between two isopycnals ρ 1 and ρ 2 we carry out the same calculation for ρ 2 and then u z ρ 1 u z ρ 2 is the value we want this discussion however suggests that it would be convenient to use ρ as an independent variable in place of z we accordingly project u z onto density coordinates using the local for each x y and t potential density profile ρ z the expression 1 is then transformed into 3 u ρ d ρ d ρ z ρ u where ρ d x y t is the density value at the bottom and the subscript ρ in z ρ represents partial derivative with respect to ρ we introduce an arbitrary constant density value ρ h such that ρ h ρ d x y t for all x y t and we formally define z ρ x y t d x y for all ρ ρ d x y t and hence z ρ 0 for ρ ρ d x y t this boundary condition is discussed by young 2012 for surface outcrops see supplement s 1 for details this definition allows ρ d to be replaced with ρ h in 3 the temporal average of the volume transport below the surface ρ is then 4 u ρ ρ h ρ d ρ z ρ u ρ where ρ denotes average for each fixed ρ the mean volume transport between the ρ 1 and ρ 2 surfaces is naturally u ρ ρ 1 u ρ ρ 2 more generally 5a ρ u ρ z ρ u ρ is the mean volume flux per unit density that is the mean volume flux between the ρ and ρ d ρ surfaces is d ρ z ρ u ρ on the other hand it can be shown that the horizontal convergence of u ρ is equal to the mean upward diapycnal volume flux per unit horizontal area supplement s 1 5b u ρ z ρ ω ρ where the prime denotes differentiation with fixed density and ω d ρ d t is the sum of all diabatic changes of density consistent with eqs 5 the long term average of the continuity equation in density coordinates reads e g young 2012 6 z ρ u ρ ρ z ρ ω ρ 0 indicating that the vector z ρ u ρ z ρ ω ρ is divergence free in the density space this circulation is sometimes called the residual mean circulation e g mcdougall and mcintosh 1996 in the above formalism the coordinate transformation is applied only to the running integral u z and then the other quantities we need z ρ u ρ and z ρ ω ρ are calculated as derivatives eqs 5a and 5b there are a few advantages to this approach first the conservation of volume eq 6 is easy to guarantee for the discrete velocity field supplement s 3 because the transport vector is a derivative of a streamfunction u eq 5 our numerical method indeed ensures that the relations 5 and 6 exactly hold for the discrete velocity field of the numerical model deshayes et al 2014 supplement s 3 second u does not have to be mapped onto density coordinates finally one does not have to calculate ω at all to do so would need the evaluation of all diabatic effects including diapycnal diffusion numerical diffusion and cabbeling see supplement s 3 1 for more details 2 5 mapping residual mean flow onto z coordinates mean vertical motion is often viewed as a combination of mean diapycnal motion and the vertical component of mean flow along sloping isopycnal surfaces there is a third process as indicated below to quantify these processes we project the residual mean flow onto z coordinates details are found in supplement s 2 1 for the mapping a mean depth field of isopycnal surfaces ζ ρ x y is needed under the transformation z ζ ρ x y using any ζ 7 u ρ ρ h ρ d ρ z ρ u ρ ρ h ρ d ρ ζ ρ u ˆ d z ρ d ζ u ˆ where u ˆ z ρ u ρ ζ ρ note that this quantity has a dimension of velocity the mean horizontal flux z ρ u ρ integrated from the bottom ρ h to ρ is equal to the vertical integral of u ˆ from the bottom d to the depth z of the density surface ρ we can therefore calculate u ˆ from u ˆ z u ρ next we define a vertical velocity associated with u ˆ by w ˆ z u ˆ with the kinematic boundary condition that w ˆ z d u ˆ d it can then be shown supplement s 2 1 that 8 w ˆ z ρ ω ρ u ˆ ζ this expression allows for a nice interpretation that this new vertical velocity w ˆ is the sum of the mean diapycnal volume flux and the vertical component of the flow along the isopycnal surface z ζ ρ x y because the residual mean circulation is projected onto z coordinates direct comparison between u ˆ w ˆ and u w is possible where denotes average at fixed z in particular we can formally attribute the difference between w and w ˆ to temporal variability 9 w w ˆ eddies because in a hypothetical state where there is no temporal variability and defining ζ z ρ y z it can be shown that u ˆ w ˆ u w we call the difference eddies but it includes all temporal variability for a more formal and conventional representation of the impacts of eddies see for example aiki and yamagata 2006 young 2012 and supplement s 2 2 2 6 volume budget we carry out the same volume budget calculation on the ofes output using exactly the same formulation as in f17 in addition we extend the calculation to density coordinates using the formulae presented in section 2 4 supplement s 3 2 extends f17 s derivation to include the use of density coordinates and to discuss numerical methods let v y be the temporal average of a zonally and vertically integrated v with its range of zonal integration from x w y to the coast and its vertical range to be specified below u y be the temporal average of a vertically and meridionally integrated horizontal velocity not just u normal to x w y with the meridional integration starting either from y s or from y n the southern or northern end of our analysis domain w y be a zonal and meridional integral of w or z ρ ω ρ on a level or density surface to be specified below with its zonal integration from x w y to the coast and its meridional integration starting either from y s or from y n with these general definitions the volume budget for the lc layer can be written as 10a v y v y n u y w y where the meridional integration is from y n to y that is the southward flow of lc v is increased by the lateral inflow u across x w y and upward volume flux w across the lower surface between y n and y in z coordinates the vertical integration is from z 0 to z d 1 and w is an integration of w on z d 1 in density coordinates the lower surface is ρ ρ 1 and w is an integration of z ρ ω ρ on it likewise for the luc layer 10b v y v y s u y w y w b y where the meridional integration is from y s to y that is the northward flow of the luc v is increased by the lateral inflow u across x w and downward w and upward w b volume fluxes across the upper z d 1 or ρ ρ 1 and lower z d b or ρ ρ b surfaces of the luc layer between y s and y note that the vertical volume flux w or z ρ ω ρ across z d 1 or ρ ρ 1 is shared by the lc and luc boxes and that the cumulative flux w is different between them only because the direction and the starting point of the meridional integration are different from y n southward for the lc layer and from y s northward for the luc layer a formal derivation of eqs 10 is found in f17 these calculations are facilitated by the quantities u and u ρ defined in section 2 4 it is noteworthy supplement s 3 2 that we use a discrete version of eqs 10 which is consistent with the model s discrete equation of continuity so that eqs 10 exactly hold for the model s discrete u w field except that the volume flux across the sea surface z 0 is assumed to vanish which is a very good approximation for a long term mean field likewise eqs 10 are exact on our discrete z ρ u ρ z ρ ω ρ field because it satisfies its own continuity equation 6 the property that x w follows edges of the model s gridboxes section 2 3 is necessary for this exact mass closure to hold deshayes et al 2014 supplement s 3 2 3 results 3 1 description in z coordinates 3 1 1 horizontal structure of the lcs fig 1 shows the horizontal velocity fields integrated over the lc and luc depth ranges and averaged over our analysis period 1993 2012 in the upper layer there is a broad poleward flow off australia from 20 s down to 24 25 s this broad flow actually consists not shown of a relatively well defined lc which is located at the shelf break and broader poleward flows offshore because the lc is relatively weak there see below and the offshore poleward flows vary from year to year not shown the long term average shows this smooth broad current south of 24 s the lc is well defined and continues around the southwestern corner and onto the south coast of australia where this flow is sometimes called the leeuwin current extension e g ridgway and condie 2004 duran et al and references therein to the south of the leeuwin current extension there is a strong westward flow south of australia the flinders current middleton and cirano 2002 and references therein which is deep extending to 3000 m hufford et al 1997 its subsurface part manifests itself as a very strong westward flow in the luc depth range in fig 1 b it appears stronger in fig 1 b than in fig 1 a because the depth range of integration is larger for the former a small fraction of the flinders current retroflects eastward at 34 s to form the luc fig 1 b unlike in f17 s geostrophic calculation on cars aus8 this retroflection does not follow the outline of the deep naturaliste plateau not shown in this mean field the plateau is deeper than the luc depth range and does not directly block the flow in some years not shown the flow shows tendencies to follow the deep bottom topography and therefore this difference between cars and ofes may be due to the smoothing of variability in this region in ofes the luc flows equatorward along the continental slope bends offshore between 23 s and 22 s and completely disappears beyond 22 s this departure of the luc from the continental slope seems to be controlled by the exmouth plateau although it is deeper than the bottom of the luc duran 2015 the departure occurs also somewhat to the south of the location where the southern edge of the plateau joins the continental slope see below there is a strong outflow from and a strong inflow into the lc at 28 5 s and 29 5 s respectively fig 1 a and a similar pair exists in the luc depth range fig 1 b in annual mean fields not shown similar mesoscale flows are more visible they tend to be vertically coherent extending to 1000 m reminiscent of the zonal jets or striations divakaran and brassington 2011 and references therein and their positions tend to vary from year to year in the average over our twenty year analysis period they tend to average out at depths leaving a series of surface trapped 0 150m eastward jets similar to menezes et al s 2014 countercurrents except for the pair of the inflow and outflow at 28 5 s and 28 9 s which has a much deeper tail 3 1 2 vertical structure of the lcs fig 2 shows zonal sections of the mean meridional velocity and potential density from ofes and from f17 s geostrophic calculation the overall vertical and horizontal structure of the lc and luc and the associated density structure are similar between cars and ofes one obvious difference is that strong mesoscale features remains in cars offshore of the lc and luc whereas they are largely canceled out by the long term averaging in ofes even though cars aus8 is a compilation of hydrographic observations over many years 1950 2012 the temporal or spatial sampling is probably insufficient to cancel out the mesoscale variability in fact the ofes annual mean field not shown includes stronger mesoscale variability similar to those in cars another difference is that the luc almost vanishes at 22 s in ofes whereas it is still strong there in cars the luc leaves the coast somewhat farther north f17 and follows the southern edge of the exmouth plateau more closely not shown in cars in both cars and ofes the lc s core is located at or somewhat offshore of the shelf break and the luc is located on the continental slope the near surface density contours slope down toward the bottom of the lc and they slope up toward the bottom of the luc both consistent with the geostrophic shear there all these characteristics are consistent with past observations e g smith et al 1991 the bottom of the mean lc stays at a relatively constant depth of 200m it is interesting that the topmost part of the luc moves to lighter density as it flows equatorward a feature noted by f17 3 1 3 zonal overturning the long term mean velocity and density fields are shifted in the x direction in such a way that x w y becomes a straight meridian section 2 3 and then their meridional averages are computed over 22 34 s fig 3 a shows the result all the characteristics of the lcs noted in the discussion of fig 2 are visible in fig 3 a except that both lc and luc appear detached from the bottom this is only because the profile of the bottom slope varies in the meridional direction the surface flow is predominantly westward which is the mean ekman drift the mean winds being predominantly equatorward not shown the weak broad poleward flow blue near the surface is a manifestation of the broad poleward flow in the north fig 2 and is consistent with geostrophy see the upward westward tilt of density contours and note that the annual mean ekman drift is very weakly equatorward not shown below the ekman layer and above 180 m is an eastward flow which feeds into the lc a small fraction of this flow upwells and feeds the westward ekman drift and the rest sinks to the luc depth range and flows westward this zonal overturning circulation is consistent with that found in cars and another eddy resolving ogcm by f17 there is a broader and weaker downwelling west of 111 7 e but remember that our x coordinate is shifted which may be part of the basin scale broad ekman downwelling subduction in the subtropical gyre e g schott et al 2002 2004 3 1 4 meridional overturning fig 3 b plots the v w field averaged between x w y and x e y which are shown as green curves in figs 1 and 2 the lc flows poleward above the equatorward flowing luc and their boundary is fairly constant in the latitudinal direction at 200m there is a downwelling near the bottom of the lc which joins the top of the luc these characteristics agree with those found for cars aus8 in f17 the lc is weakened at 28 5 s and strengthened again at 29 5 s barely visible in the figure consistent with the outflow and inflow noted for fig 1 a likewise the luc is strengthened and weakened again at 29 5 s and 28 5 s respectively by the same pair of inflow and outflow fig 1 b note that the density contours shoal poleward within the lc and most of them outcrop by 34 s consistent with the general poleward increase in sea surface density as noted for fig 2 although the top of the luc stays around 200m its density gradually decreases as it flows equatorward these relations between the currents and density are discussed in section 3 2 in greater detail 3 1 5 volume budget finally fig 4 shows the volume budgets for the lc and luc depth ranges according to eqs 10 the lc is weak at 22 s and is accelerated to its maximum transport by 25 s by the lateral inflow u consistent with the horizontal flow pattern fig 1 a the lateral inflow continues but the lc ceases to be accelerated and hence the solid and dotted curves start to diverge from 24 s instead of accelerating the lc the zonal inflow is absorbed by the sinking w it is interesting that the mesoscale features of u are mostly absorbed by the local accelerations and decelerations of the lc and the downwelling does not include much mesoscale features in total there is a lateral inflow of 2 8sv half of which is used to accelerate the lc and the other half downwells a small equatorward branch of the flinders current is the source of the luc fig 1 b and its transport is about 0 5sv at 34 s fig 4 b further north a small retroflection of the flinders current joins the luc eastward which is reflected as the lateral inflow and acceleration of the luc between 34 s and 33 5 s after that the lateral flow is generally westward out of the luc box apart from the mesoscale inflows and outflows despite this general outflow the luc is generally accelerated up to 28 s by the downwelling w from the lc layer equatorward of 28 s the outflow somewhat increases and the downwelling somewhat decreases and as a result the luc is gradually weakened finally it rapidly veers offshore between 23 s and 22 s fig 1 b there is a negligibly small upwelling w b through the bottom 900m of the luc layer mostly concentrated around 29 s which may have something to do with the relatively large deep mesoscale inflow there fig 1 in summary these volume budgets are due to two components one is the zonal and meridional overturning seen in figs 3 a and 3 b in which a broad lateral eastward inflow in the upper layer downwells into the lower layer and flows offshore westward and the other is the mostly horizontal mesoscale recirculations visible in fig 1 qualitatively this picture is the same as that of f17 the only notable qualitative difference is that the relative contribution of the lateral inflow in the south to the luc is smaller in ofes than in cars quantitatively all flows are weaker in ofes compare our fig 4 with f17 s fig 11 3 2 the structure of the lcs in density coordinates we plotted a meridional composite like fig 3 a in density coordinates not shown because the density of the lc drastically changes in the meridional direction see below the meridional composite at fixed density turned out more confusing than useful we therefore skip the zonal circulation 3 2 1 meridional circulation fig 5 shows the residual mean circulation zonally integrated over the lc band x w y x e y the contours show the zonal and temporal averages of depths of isopycnal surfaces isopycnal depths the poleward flow near the sea surface i e lighter density is the lc its upper part is largely parallel to z ρ contours and becomes denser as it flows poleward consistent with the zonal and temporal average in z coordinates fig 3 b where the water appears to flow at constant depths and to cross density contours as it flows poleward interestingly however below z ρ 100 m the diapycnal flux is very weak e g the arrows are almost horizontal in fig 5 which means that the water flows poleward and upward with z ρ decreasing along isopycnals in the lower part of the lc because diapycnal diffusion is minimal below the mixed layer section 2 1 this result in density coordinates is as expected in contrast the arrows appear to cross isopycnals in z coordinates even in the lower part of the lc fig 3 b the vertical motion is even downward near the bottom of the lc this apparent discrepancy must be due to the large poleward bend in the x y plane of isopycnal surfaces not shown which is due to the poleward advection of light warm water by the lc e g legeckis and cresswell 1981 weaver and middleton 1989 benthuysen et al 2014 in the lower part of the lc the water parcels move on average eastward and on joining the lc turn poleward all along isopycnals in this way the zonal mean meridional flow appears to be crossing the zonal mean isopycnal surfaces in z coordinates fig 3 b without actually crossing isopycnals interestingly the bottom of the lc moves to higher densities as the lc flows poleward fig 5 even though the flow itself is along isopycnals this feature is due to the eastward inflow that keeps adding volume to the lc fig 4 below the lc is the luc which flows equatorward along isopycnals the arrows being horizontal similarly to the migration of the bottom of the lc the luc s upper bound moves to lighter densities equatorward although it stays largely below 200m as shown later this extension is also due to lateral eastward inflow of lighter waters across x w that joins the top of the luc even though the overall lateral transport is outward westward if averaged over the entire luc layer fig 4 unlike in the x z and y z circulation figs 3 a and 3 b in z coordinates there is no downwelling from the lc to the luc layer 3 2 2 volume budget this weakness of diapycnal flux between the lc and luc layers is quantified in a similar volume budget calculation to fig 4 this time however no isopycnal forms a clear boundary between the lc and luc fig 5 we choose ρ 1 26 0 σ θ and ρ b 27 0 σ θ as the top and bottom of the luc in density coordinates for convenience according to fig 5 ρ 1 and ρ b respectively enter the lower parts of the lc and luc poleward of 28 s the definitions of the volume fluxes are the same as in z coordinates section 2 6 except that the vertical integration is either between the sea surface and ρ 1 or between ρ 1 and ρ b eqs 10 still hold fig 6 is the result the meridional structure of the lc transport v is similar to that in z coordinates fig 4 especially equatorward of 28 s after the large outflow at 28 5 s however the lc transport does not recover in density coordinates because of the weaker lateral inflow this suggests that most inflow seen in fig 4 poleward of 28 s occurs below ρ 1 and above z 1 depth fig 5 indeed the lateral inflow to the luc box is larger in density coordinates fig 6 b than in z coordinates fig 4 b poleward of 28 s a shortcoming because the ρ 1 26 σ θ surface is shallower than the bottom of the lc poleward of 28 s fig 5 the lc s meridional evolution is almost entirely due to the lateral inflow the slight difference south of 31 s is due to weak diapycnal upwelling across the ρ 1 surface the meridional evolution of the luc fig 6 lower panel is also similar to that in z coordinates the luc transport is somewhat weaker poleward of 29 s than in z coordinates because it now includes the small fraction of the lc below ρ 1 the lateral inflow is positive eastward on average south of 29 s likely because it now includes the part missed by the lc layer mentioned above equatorward of 28 s lateral outflow dominates and the luc is decelerated accordingly contribution from vertical exchange is negligible throughout it is reassuring that the impact of numerical diffusion is negligible suggesting that mesoscale eddies are well resolved griffies et al 2000 3 2 3 residual mean circulation projected onto z coordinates we project the residual mean flow onto z coordinates by z ζ ρ x y z ρ ρ x y section 2 5 and calculate the volume budgets for the lc and luc boxes fig 7 the vertical motion w ˆ associated with the mapped residual mean circulation is weak except for the localized downwelling at about 29 s the budget curves are more similar to those in fig 6 than to those in fig 4 because the diapycnic flux is negligible the downward motion w ˆ is interpreted as due to flow along isopycnal surfaces eq 8 the above results further indicates that the vertical component of the along isopycnal flow of u ˆ is not a major contributor to the vertical motion either at least in the present interpretation using z z ρ ρ x y for the mapping in other words 9 reduces to w w ˆ eddy u ˆ ζ eddy eddy that is mean vertical motion is mostly due to temporal variability 3 2 4 isopycnal circulation to understand what three dimensional structure of the residual mean circulation leads to the above results we plot the residual mean transport within five representative density layers fig 8 lc layer in the shallowest layer in the figure 23 5 23 6 σ θ a southwestward flow on the north west shelf holloway current d adamo et al 2009 is seen to be one of the sources of the lc a broad southward flow offshore also joins and accelerates the lc between 22 s and 24 s consistent with the lateral inflow and the acceleration of the lc in figs 4 a and 6 a according to these volume budget curves further inflow occurs between 24 s and 25 s which resides on deeper isopycnals not shown the lc in this layer gradually weakens south of 25 s and vanishes at about 28 s presumably because surface cooling by the atmosphere converts the lighter water to a heavier one figs 3 b and 5 the maximum sea surface density during the year is often higher than 24 0 σ θ over the region plotted in fig 8 the density layer we discuss now 23 5 23 6 σ θ vanishes at such times in summer the layer extends to and outcrops at 28 s which is the southernmost latitude the layer can exist south of 25 s the lc appears weak near the offshore edge the green curve because density is typically higher there than 23 6 σ θ even in summer not shown the next layer 24 4 24 5 σ θ extends to 32 s in summer it is interesting that there is a strong outflow from the lc between 28 and 29 s this flow recirculates and creates a weak countercurrent along the offshore edge of the lc this feature is visible in fig 1 a and is also the reason for the dip in the lc transport at 28 s in figs 4 a and 6 a the lost transport is partially recovered at 29 s in these volume budget plots between 29 s and 30 s because this recirculation rejoins the lc there the main onshore flow that rejoins the lc however occurs on somewhat deeper isopycnals not shown in the present density range fig 8 b the onshore flow of the recirculation is weak and occurs between 30 s and 31 s the gradual inflow and acceleration of the lc further south seen in the volume budget curves figs 4 a and 6 a is a superposition of recirculating inflows and outflows with a similarly complicated vertical structure not shown which does not lend itself to a simple description luc layer the next density layer in the figure fig 8 c includes the bottom of the lc in the south and the uppermost part of luc in the north see also fig 5 in this density layer an interior eastward flow joins the top of the luc at around 29 s this is the main source of the lighter upper luc seen in fig 5 above the 26 3 σ θ surface the additional inflow into the luc near 23 s seen in fig 5 is also visible on somewhat lighter density surfaces not shown part of the inflow immediately turns offshore between 29 s and 28 s consistent with the deceleration of the luc in the volume budget calculations figs 4 a and 6 a this offshore flow is vertically collocated with the outflow from the lc in fig 8 b although the direction of the outflow has also a southward component in the lc layer in this panel fig 8 c are plotted two mean depth z ρ contours the isopycnals deepen from the outer edge of the lc toward its core see also fig 3 a fig 8 c indicates that the onshore inflow around 29 s goes downward across the z ρ 200 m contour which is expressed as the downwelling in the volume budget calculation on the residual mean flow mapped to z coordinates fig 7 a between 23 and 22 s the luc turns westward and vanishes in the next density layer fig 8 d the luc originates from the onshore retroflection of the flinders current there is a weak outflow to the north decelerating the luc and there is some inflow between 32 and 30 s accelerating the luc again figs 4 a and 6 a between 30 and 28 s there is a pair of strong inflow and outflow creating the peak luc transport see also figs 5 and 6 b north of 26 s there is week outflow figs 4 a and 6 a and finally between 23 and 22 s the luc turns westward and vanishes the bottom of the luc fig 8 e starts also as a retroflection of the flinders current and there is an inflow at about 29 s as in the upper layers the luc however all bends offshore at 29 s and disappears there the inflow and outflow over 30 29 s and 29 28 s respectively is vertically coherent over the luc depth range figs 8 c to e further north the luc is replaced by a poleward current along the slope this current occupies the entire latitude range on deeper isopycnals not shown and is visible in fig 5 this flow extends down to 2000 m but appears to be somewhat less coherent or persistent than the lc or luc not shown in this way lighter water is added to the top of the luc in the north and heavier water leaves from the bottom of the luc in the south as a result the core of the luc appears to move to lighter density surfaces as it flows north fig 5 see also fig 2 3 2 5 overturning based on the mean field alone fig 9 a plots the residual mean velocity vertically integrated above the 26 0 σ θ surface this velocity field is very similar to the integrated velocity for the upper 200m fig 1 a except that the shading shows the u component for figs 9 a and 9 b which is because the 26 0 σ θ surface approximately follows the bottom of the lc fig 9 c shows the mean diapycnal velocity across the 26 0 σ θ surface this flux is mostly positive upward east of x w y and has a very small net contribution to the volume budget fig 6 in passing the diapycnal flux generally turns negative in the south the 26 0 σ θ surface outcrops in the south in winter not shown which suggests that lighter water is cooled and converted to heavier water resulting in downwelling in the density space on the other hand the reason for the net diapycnal upwelling east of x w is not clear what happens if the isopycnal diapycnal separation is attempted on the temporal averages in z coordinates u v and ρ this simulates a calculation of isopycnal and diapycnal flows from a climatological t s data it turns out that the horizontal velocity looks very similar to fig 9 a not shown the difference is mostly less than 30 fig 9 b its horizontal divergence fig 9 d is however 10 times as large as the true diapycnic flux and has the opposite sign fig 9 c in other words the mean field u v ρ gives both qualitatively and quantitatively wrong vertical flux that appears to be diapycnic the isopycnal flow derived from u v ρ has extra onshore flow orange brown in fig 9 b which converges at the shelf break and results in the extra diapycnic downwelling fig 9 d 4 summary and discussion 4 1 summary to understand the three dimensional structure of the circulation of the leeuwin current system lcs we construct a mean flow over twenty years in z coordinates and density coordinates from the three day snapshots of an eddy resolving ogcm the mean flow in z coordinates forms a zonal and a meridional overturning fig 3 where an eastward zonal flow enters the leeuwin current lc flows poleward and at the same time sinks to the leeuwin undercurrent luc depths flows equatorward and finally moves westward out of the lcs to quantify this circulation we set up two control volumes one on top of the other whose offshore western edges tightly fit the lc and luc and inshore edges coincide with the australian continent fig 4 the upper layer eastward flow tends to accelerate the lc but the downwelling into the luc layer absorbs a large fraction of it in the south the luc is accelerated both by the downwelling and an eastward inflow in the north it becomes weaker and eventually vanishes owing to an westward outflow despite the continuous downwelling the lc and luc transports include small scale variability which is highly correlated with the variability in zonal inflow and outflow but the downwelling is much smoother suggesting that the small scale features are all horizontal recirculations all these results agree with those of furue et al 2017 f17 who analyzed a geostrophic velocity field based on a gridded hydrography as well as the velocity field of another eddy resolving model on the other hand the mean flow in density coordinates is mostly isopycnic except that the upper part of the lc becomes denser presumably partly owing to sea surface cooling as it flows poleward fig 5 see also figs 8 a and b it is interesting that the lower part of the lc becomes denser not because of cooling but because denser water joins the lc from the interior ocean see also fig 8 c the luc also becomes lighter as it flows equatorward because the lower part leaves the luc fig 8 e and eastward flows join the top of the luc from the interior fig 8 c volume budget calculations are carried out on the residual mean flow fig 6 using the same control volumes except that the vertical boundary between the lc and luc layers are set to a constant density consistent with the very small explicit diapycnal diffusion below the mixed layer in the model diapycnal volume flux is negligible between the lc and luc layers the changes in volume transports of the lc and luc are almost entirely controlled by lateral inflow and outflow in each layer this mean flow pattern coincides with some of the pathways of domingues et al s 2007 lagrangian floats the residual mean transport field fig 8 indicates that the part of the eastward flow that enters the lc box just flows poleward and the other part that enters the luc box just flows equatorward on the other hand the residual mean flow does not include the flow pattern f17 s volume budget analysis implied the interior eastward flow would enter the lc box and the large fraction of it would sink into the luc box before exiting the luc westward f17 s conjecture that the equatorward lightening of the luc is due to the downwelling from the lc layer is therefore wrong the downwelling across the 200 m isobath in the z coordinate average is a result of temporal variability not a property of the isopycnal mean flow finally to simulate a geostrophic calculation on climatological hydrography we test what would happen if only long term mean fields in z coordinates were available fig 9 it turns out that a large downwelling across the mean density surface is predicted from the bottom of the lc this result also supports the idea that the actual mean downwelling in z coordinates without diapycnal flux is possible owing to temporal correlation between velocity and isopycnal depths 4 2 discussion 4 2 1 kinematics of the downwelling this situation is reminiscent of that of the so called deacon cell döös and webb 1994 and references therein the zonally integrated streamfunction in z coordinates from a global ocean gcm is known to include a deep meridional overturning cell across the equatorward edge of the antarctic circumpolar current with strong downwelling and upwelling at around 40 s and 60 s respectively manabe et al 1990 this downwelling was especially puzzling because it appeared to cross mean isopycnal surfaces this mean vertical motion however turned out to be the vertical component of the mean motion of water parcels along zonally tilted isopycnal surfaces upon zonal average along isopycnal surfaces the equatorward and poleward motions almost cancel out each other and the overturning cell almost disappears in density coordinates döös et al 2008 for this reason this cell is sometimes called spurious e g mcintosh and mcdougall 1996 this situation is schematically depicted in fig 10 b with axes a and b interpreted as x and y respectively in the present study downwelling is also isopycnic fig 6 fig 10 a shows the eastward running integral from 105 e in the shifted x coordinate section 2 3 of w across 200m integrated over 34 22 s in the interior ocean there is a weak downwelling which is probably the manifestation of the interior subduction e g schott et al 2002 2004 there is also a weak upwelling just west of x w both these upwelling and downwelling are visible in fig 3 a there is then the stronger downwelling west of x w on average therefore the water parcel that flows into the lc sinks and exits the lcs when or where the isopycnal surface is deeper it stays deep at least in our study region and its upwelling may require heating at low latitudes as in the regular subtropical cell e g mccreary and lu 1994 for this reason this sinking may not be spurious in the sense of the deacon cell if that is the case this flow may be regarded as a form of subduction the mechanism of the sinking however does not seem to be a downslope flow along mean isopycnals as in regular subduction but due to temporal variability as discussed above a plausible scenario is this the particle moves eastward near the surface the water converges at the continental slope and the density layer the particle belongs to becomes thicker which results in a downward vertical velocity within the density layer the particle then sinks turns westward and exits the lcs at a deeper depth as a result the eastward and westward velocities cancel in density coordinates on temporal average that would be the reason that the horizontal convergence of the mean horizontal transports which is equal to the mean diapycnic velocity is weak in density coordinates if the thinning phase of the density layer were perfectly symmetric with the thickening phase there should be a mean upward motion that would cancel the downward motion in the thickening phase on temporal average but the fact that w 0 suggests that when the layer thins the associated upward motion is weaker for some reason if there were no mean flow the water particle would return to a shallow depth when the layer thins forming a small circular trajectory if so there would be a matching upwelling just west of x w the fact that the upwelling west of x w does not entirely cancel the downward flux fig 10 a suggests that some of the particles are entrained in a mean downward flow perhaps that of the interior subduction what drives such a flow associated with eddies is not clear neither is it clear whether the notion that this flow is driven by eddies is apt or not we do not know after all what the hypothetical eddy less state would look like our analysis is totally kinematic lacking any dynamical interpretation if mesoscale eddies and the resultant downwelling are a crucial dynamical ingredient that might explain why benthuysen et al s 2014 ogcm did not reproduce a luc while it produced a strong lc 4 2 2 jet like inflow and outflow the large scale poleward sea level drop in the south indian ocean godfrey and ridgway 1985 maximenko and niiler 2005 suggests a broad eastward geostrophic flow near the sea surface some studies e g menezes et al 2014 however find a set of jet like eastward flows instead as suggested by f17 this feature may be a superposition of a shallow 200 m broad eastward geostrophic flow and a set of deep 1000 m eastward and westward jets because they are deep these jets contribute to the small scale features not only in the lc but also in the luc figs 4 and 8 the comparison of these small scale structures between numerical models and observations is tricky as observations include remnants of mesoscale noise and these jets are not necessarily stationary such deep jets or striations are ubiquitous in the world ocean e g divakaran and brassington 2011 taguchi et al 2012 whereas some jets seem to be generated in the interior ocean nakano and hasumi 2005 qiu et al 2013 and some migrate in the meridional direction richards et al 2006 some seem to be quasi stationary and generated at the eastern boundary by the instability of coastal currents davis et al 2014 their positions presumably fixed by coastal features this or similar mechanism may exist at the west coast of australia generating the quasi stationary jets we see 4 3 concluding remarks the present study raises a number of questions what is the dynamical significance if any of the euler mean downwelling what is the nature of the temporal variability that give rise to the downwelling in z coordinates although we have loosely called it eddies other types of variabilities may contribute in particular the depths of isopycnals have a clear seasonal cycle which might play some role also how is this overturning circulation closed if the downwelling is a form of subduction the downwelled water may be joining the shallow overturning circulation schott et al 2002 describes what is the fate of the luc after it has left the continental slope the luc water seems to keep flowing westward after leaving the coast instead of following the outline of the exmouth plateau and returning to the australian coast not shown on a more technical note how would the error in the diagnosed mean diapycnic velocity change if the sampling interval were shorter or longer our sampling interval of three days is most likely sufficient considering that the diagnosed diapycnal flux is small section 3 and that the strongest variability in our model at a 1 10 resolution under daily mean forcings section 2 is likely due to mesoscale eddies a necessary sampling interval for a higher resolution model under higher frequency forcings or an optimal sampling interval to save storage space while minimizing error may be an interesting subject of study f17 compared the volume budget like fig 4 between another eddy resolving model ofam3 oke et al 2013 and a geostrophic velocity field based on the gridded hydrography cars aus8 described in section 2 2 if we now add the present result from ofes to the comparison we can see that both ofam3 and ofes qualitatively agree with cars but quantitatively the flows are systematically weaker in the ogcms than in cars this is an interesting difference do we need more horizontal resolution for example for ogcms to improve the flow field of the lcs wijeratne et al 2018 analyzed an ogcm with a 3 4km resolution and found significantly larger lc transports than in our ogcms even though this is not a clean comparison because the zonal and vertical extents of integration are somewhat different it is also interesting that the structure of the self break currents along the south coast of australia such as the leeuwin current extension has some similarity to that of the lc there is indeed a systematic mean downwelling averaged in z coordinates from the surface layer that includes the eastward flowing shelf break currents to a deeper layer where there seem to exist a westward flowing undercurrent duran et al acknowledgments the

24032,the leeuwin current system lcs consists of the leeuwin current lc a surface poleward current along the west coast of australia the leeuwin undercurrent luc a subsurface equatorward current on the continental slope beneath the lc and zonal flows in the interior ocean that interact with the lc and luc to understand the three dimensional structure of the lcs circulation we construct a mean flow over twenty years in z coordinates and density coordinates from three day snapshots of an eddy resolving ocean general circulation model ogcm and carry out a leak free volume budget analysis on the mean flow field in both coordinate systems the mean flow in z coordinates forms a zonal and a meridional overturning where a near surface eastward flow enters the lc flows poleward and at the same time sinks to the luc depths flows equatorward and finally moves westward out of the lcs as found in a previous study on the other hand the mean flow in density coordinates is mostly isopycnic except that the upper part of the lc becomes denser as it flows poleward partly owing to sea surface cooling the lower part of the lc becomes denser not because of cooling but because denser water joins the lc from the interior ocean the luc becomes lighter as it flows equatorward because its lower part flows westward out of the lcs and its top part is joined by eastward flows from the interior the mean downwelling in z coordinates is therefore isopycnic and is likely a result of temporal variability keywords leeuwin current leeuwin undercurrent eddy resolving ogcm volume budget diapycnal flux residual mean circulation 1 introduction 1 1 description of the lcs the leeuwin current lc is a narrow current that flows poleward on the shelf break along the west coast of australia over the top 200m and the leeuwin undercurrent luc flows equatorward on the continental slope below the lc and extending from 200m to 800 m e g domingues et al 2007 woo and pattiaratchi 2008 furue et al 2017 and references therein offshore interior flows interact with these boundary currents see below and together they form the leeuwin current system lcs this is a follow on paper to furue et al 2017 hereafter f17 and as such the present introduction serves only to establish a minimal context for the present study the reader is refer to the introduction of f17 which includes broader background information about the lcs and cites other papers that include excellent reviews 1 1 1 leeuwin current the lc starts as a narrow coastal current from 22 s north west cape its main sources are southward or southeastward flows from the interior ocean and in austral autumn a southwestward current along the northwest coast of australia the holloway current also joins the head of the lc domingues et al 2007 d adamo et al 2009 further south eastward flows seem to join or impinge on the lc domingues et al 2007 waite et al 2007 meuleners et al 2008 menezes et al 2014 f17 mesoscale eddy activity is strong in this region and the lc is sometimes disrupted by eddies feng et al 2005 waite et al 2007 meuleners et al 2008 moreover semi stationary mesoscale recirculations interact with the lc in long term 10 20yr averages of eddy resolving ocean general circulation model ogcm solutions and in a geostrophic calculation derived from a gridded climatological hydrography f17 the lc flows around the southwest corner of australia cape leeuwin 34 s and continues on the shelf break along the south coast of australia e g cresswell and peterson 1993 duran et al and references therein 1 1 2 leeuwin undercurrent the luc exists between 200m and 800 m most part of the flinders current fc a northern boundary current of the subtropical gyre flowing westward extending from the sea surface to 2000 m along the south coast of australia middleton and cirano 2002 continues westward past the southwest corner of australia cape leeuwin 34 s but a small fraction of it bends equatorward to form the luc at cape leeuwin woo and pattiaratchi 2008 batteen and miller 2009 duran 2015 another small fraction of the fc retroflects eastward and joins the luc to the north of cape leeuwin duran 2015 f17 as it flows equatorward the core of the luc seems to migrate to lighter density although its upper bound stays at 200 m f17 mesoscale eddies and eddy like semi stationary recirculations interact with the luc as it flows equatorward on the continental slope meuleners et al 2008 f17 at 23 22 s the luc bends offshore to leave the continental slope duran 2015 f17 apparently following the southern flank of the exmouth plateau although the top of the plateau is deeper than the bottom of the luc duran 2015 1 1 3 downwelling and zonal overturning one striking difference of the eastern south indian ocean from the other eastern subtropical oceans is the large poleward sea level drop godfrey and ridgway 1985 maximenko and niiler 2005 associated with this drop is a near surface eastward geostrophic flow schott and mccreary 2001 and references therein which is broken up into narrower jet like flows domingues et al 2007 menezes et al 2014 f17 this flow generally extends to 200 m depth domingues et al 2007 menezes et al 2014 f17 despite the offshore westward ekman drift the net transport is generally onshore in the upper 200m which tends to accelerate the lc domingues et al 2007 f17 as it flows eastward the near surface water tends to downwell in this region domingues et al 2007 this tendency is consistent with the fact that the subtropical subduction zone extends close to australia schott et al 2002 in addition much stronger downwelling has been reported in or near the lc domingues et al 2007 f17 f17 set up two control volumes boxes that follow the outlines of the lc and luc and calculated volume fluxes across the faces of the boxes using a geostrophic velocity field based on a gridded hydrographical climatology they also carried out the same calculation on the long term averaged velocity field of an eddy resolving ogcm they found that a large fraction of the eastward volume flux that enters the lc box from the interior ocean sinks into the luc box instead of accelerating the lc and then exits the luc westward out of the offshore edge of the luc box thus forming a zonal overturning circulation their fig 12 domingues et al 2007 released lagrangian particles in their eddy permitting ogcm and found that some of their near surface particles gradually sink as they flow eastward and some of them join the lc and start to flow poleward and some sink deep enough to directly join the luc and start to flow equatorward before flowing back westward out of the luc the latter particles thus form a zonal overturning cell but the cell appears slightly different from f17 s where the eastward flux first enters the lc box before sinking to the luc depth see also furue et al 2018a 1 1 4 watermass properties the interior eastward flow that joins the lc is also consistent with the watermass properties the low salinity low s high oxygen high o source water of the lc is gradually overwhelmed by the high s indian central water icw woo and pattiaratchi 2008 the core of the luc consists of the high o subantarctic mode water which forms south of australia and is carried westward by the flinders current woo and pattiaratchi 2008 whether the icw is found in the upper part of the luc is debated the downwelling from the lc box into the luc box in f17 or domingues et al s 2007 pathway of near surface water joining the luc would suggest that the upper part of the luc should include some icw f17 also explained the northward migration of the luc core to lighter density as due to the additional lighter water from the lc layer on the other hand woo and pattiaratchi 2008 did not find icw there 1 2 present study it is not clear how the zonal overturning cell works if the icw joins the lc and sinks to the luc level as indicated by f17 s volume budget analysis or if some near surface water directly joins the luc as suggested by some of domingues et al s 2007 lagrangian particles the water must be found at the top of the luc is this a major pathway of the interior water another important and interesting question is how much diapycnal mixing is necessary for this downwelling the overturning pathway as described above appears to be crossing mean isopycnal surfaces the mean isopycnals however have a complex three dimensional structure and may allow for a mean downward along isopycnal motions it is also possible that temporal variability presumably due to mesoscale eddies may result in mean vertical volume flux without diapycnal flux to address these questions we analyze a high frequency output from an eddy resolving ogcm we calculate volume fluxes in density coordinates to separate isopycnal and diapycnal transports the frequency of the output must be high enough to resolve intrinsic temporal variabilities in the model the fastest of which for our spatial resolution is presumably that associated with mesoscale eddies otherwise spurious diapycnal flux would be diagnosed hazeleger et al 2003 this paper is organized as follows the next section describes the ogcm and a hydrographic dataset the latter used to validate the ogcm and then discusses the methods of analyses section 3 describes the three dimensional structure of the mean flow first in z coordinates and then in density coordinates finally section 4 summarizes and discusses the results the supplementary material provides technical details which section 2 only summarizes 2 data and methods 2 1 numerical model the ogcm we use is that of masumoto et al 2004 sasaki et al 2006 and sasaki et al 2008 and is called ofes for ogcm for the earth simulator which is a variant of the modular ocean model version 3 mom3 pacanowski and griffies 2000 detailed descriptions of ofes are found in the above three references and in furue et al 2018b here we only discuss the most important aspects of the model for the present study the computational domain is semi global extending from 7 5 s to 7 5 n with a horizontal grid spacing of 1 1 0 and there are 54 levels in the vertical with the grid spacing increasing from 5m at the sea surface to 15m at 200 m depth then to about 140m at 1000 m and finally to 330m at the maximum depth of 6065m the model topography is based on a 1 30 bathymetry dataset from the occam project webb et al 1997 1998 the model uses partial bottom cells pacanowski and gnanadesikan 1998 pacanowski and griffies 2000 to follow the actual bottom as closely as possible at the given horizontal resolution the horizontal mixing is parameterized with a two dimensional biharmonic operator semtner and mintz 1977 and the vertical mixing with the kpp scheme large et al 1994 our data is a set of three day snapshots from the ncep run described in detail by sasaki et al 2008 data publicly available from http apdrc soest hawaii edu the model has been integrated from 1950 to 2017 so far under daily mean forcings based on atmospheric variables from the ncep ncar reanalysis kalnay et al 1996 we use the twenty years from 1993 to 2012 to compare the model with the cars aus8 gridded hydrographic climatology see below which is based on hydrographic profiles including argo up to the end of 2012 2 2 gridded hydrography we use a gridded t s climatology called cars aus8 which is a regional high resolution version of cars csiro atlas of regional seas ridgway et al 2002 dunn and ridgway 2002 http www cmar csiro au cars http www marine csiro au atlas cars aus8 maps historical hydrographic profiles from 1950 to the end of 2012 onto a 1 8 grid and is designed to resolve longshore currents around australia using a terrain aware anisotropic smoothing interpolation technique ridgway et al 2002 dunn and ridgway 2002 f17 and duran et al applied a geostrophic calculation to this dataset and showed that it indeed resolves the climatological flow field of the lcs and the similar narrow coastal current system along the south coast of australia in the present paper we briefly compare the ogcm flow field with f17 s geostrophic velocity derived from cars aus8 the geostrophic calculation is referenced to 900 m where the ocean is deeper than 900 m but in the shallower ocean the unknown barotropic velocity is adjusted in such a way as to eliminate volume flux through the ocean bottom 2 3 coordinate system following the lcs to define and visualize the zonal and meridional circulation associated with the lcs we introduce a curved surface x x w y which is independent of z like a curtain and is designed to follow the offshore outline of both lc and luc for a visual aid see fig 2 below as in f17 we locate the position of the 200 m isobath x x z200 y off the west coast of australia between 34 s and 22 s and define x w y to be 0 8 west of the isobath x w y x z200 y 0 8 at many latitudes the mean lc extends somewhat onshore of the shelf break see below and we define its inshore edge to be x e y x z200 y 0 1 the bottom topography we refer to is that of the numerical model section 2 1 when determining x w and x e for the numerical model we choose for each latitude the gridbox whose bottom is the closest to 200 m instead of finding the x coordinate of 200 m depth by zonal interpolation so that x w and x e exactly follow edges of gridboxes see fig 1 below this definition allows for an exact calculation of volume budgets deshayes et al 2014 see supplement s 3 for technical details a minor inconvenience is that some zonal integrals and averages include gridscale noise e g fig 3 b below in f17 an additional curve was used to delineate the offshore edge of the luc which was located slightly offshore of the curve x w because the luc tends to be located slightly offshore of the lc the difference between the two curves however was not essential in f17 the vertical volume transport was strongest near the inshore edge of the luc box where its upper surface is shared by the bottom surface of the lc box and the volume transport across that portion of the upper surface of the luc box which is not shared was minor in the present study we therefore use x x w y to delineate both lc and luc as can be seen below fig 1 below the curve fits both currents fairly well the vertical extents of the mean lc and luc are relatively constant in the latitudinal direction shown later in fig 2 and we set the nominal bottoms of the lc and luc to be at d 1 200 m and d b 900 m respectively as in f17 the depth 900m is well beyond the bottom of the luc and therefore was a good choice of the level of no motion in f17 in density coordinates however the vertical boundary between the mean lc and luc significantly changes in the latitudinal direction the densities of the lc change much and those of the luc somewhat shown later in fig 5 for convenience we set ρ 1 26 σ θ and ρ b 27 σ θ as nominal upper and lower boundaries of the luc to visualize the x z circulation associated with the lcs we shift the variables in the zonal direction at each latitude in such a way that x w y becomes a straight meridional line along 113 s for convenience while the actual meridional average of the unshifted x w y is 112 95 e 2 4 isopycnal and diapycnal transports here we summarize a formulation to construct the three dimensional structure of the flow in density coordinates details are found in supplement s 1 the formulation is based on temporal residual mean trm and thickness weighted average twa quantities e g mcdougall and mcintosh 1996 aiki and yamagata 2006 young 2012 it has been used mostly to understand or interpret the impacts of mesoscale eddies in large scale circulation e g aiki and yamagata 2006 or to parameterize them in coarse resolution ogcms e g gent et al 1995 this study on the other hand focuses on diagnosing mean diapycnal volume flux and on constructing a three dimensional view of the mean lcs circulation in density coordinates our formulation is specifically designed for that purpose and in particular it calculates exact volume transports from the discrete velocity field of the numerical model deshayes et al 2014 supplement s 3 we integrate the horizontal velocity from the bottom upward at each point x y for each snapshot for each t 1 u d z d z u we sometimes use a complementary quantity which is the integral from z to the sea surface u z u 0 u z the volume transport below an arbitrary density surface ρ 1 can be calculated from 2 u z ρ 1 d z ρ 1 d z u for each x y t by finding the depth z ρ 1 at which ρ ρ 1 we basically carry out this calculation for each x y t and then take its temporal average to obtain the mean transport below the isopycnal ρ 1 if we need to know the mean transport between two isopycnals ρ 1 and ρ 2 we carry out the same calculation for ρ 2 and then u z ρ 1 u z ρ 2 is the value we want this discussion however suggests that it would be convenient to use ρ as an independent variable in place of z we accordingly project u z onto density coordinates using the local for each x y and t potential density profile ρ z the expression 1 is then transformed into 3 u ρ d ρ d ρ z ρ u where ρ d x y t is the density value at the bottom and the subscript ρ in z ρ represents partial derivative with respect to ρ we introduce an arbitrary constant density value ρ h such that ρ h ρ d x y t for all x y t and we formally define z ρ x y t d x y for all ρ ρ d x y t and hence z ρ 0 for ρ ρ d x y t this boundary condition is discussed by young 2012 for surface outcrops see supplement s 1 for details this definition allows ρ d to be replaced with ρ h in 3 the temporal average of the volume transport below the surface ρ is then 4 u ρ ρ h ρ d ρ z ρ u ρ where ρ denotes average for each fixed ρ the mean volume transport between the ρ 1 and ρ 2 surfaces is naturally u ρ ρ 1 u ρ ρ 2 more generally 5a ρ u ρ z ρ u ρ is the mean volume flux per unit density that is the mean volume flux between the ρ and ρ d ρ surfaces is d ρ z ρ u ρ on the other hand it can be shown that the horizontal convergence of u ρ is equal to the mean upward diapycnal volume flux per unit horizontal area supplement s 1 5b u ρ z ρ ω ρ where the prime denotes differentiation with fixed density and ω d ρ d t is the sum of all diabatic changes of density consistent with eqs 5 the long term average of the continuity equation in density coordinates reads e g young 2012 6 z ρ u ρ ρ z ρ ω ρ 0 indicating that the vector z ρ u ρ z ρ ω ρ is divergence free in the density space this circulation is sometimes called the residual mean circulation e g mcdougall and mcintosh 1996 in the above formalism the coordinate transformation is applied only to the running integral u z and then the other quantities we need z ρ u ρ and z ρ ω ρ are calculated as derivatives eqs 5a and 5b there are a few advantages to this approach first the conservation of volume eq 6 is easy to guarantee for the discrete velocity field supplement s 3 because the transport vector is a derivative of a streamfunction u eq 5 our numerical method indeed ensures that the relations 5 and 6 exactly hold for the discrete velocity field of the numerical model deshayes et al 2014 supplement s 3 second u does not have to be mapped onto density coordinates finally one does not have to calculate ω at all to do so would need the evaluation of all diabatic effects including diapycnal diffusion numerical diffusion and cabbeling see supplement s 3 1 for more details 2 5 mapping residual mean flow onto z coordinates mean vertical motion is often viewed as a combination of mean diapycnal motion and the vertical component of mean flow along sloping isopycnal surfaces there is a third process as indicated below to quantify these processes we project the residual mean flow onto z coordinates details are found in supplement s 2 1 for the mapping a mean depth field of isopycnal surfaces ζ ρ x y is needed under the transformation z ζ ρ x y using any ζ 7 u ρ ρ h ρ d ρ z ρ u ρ ρ h ρ d ρ ζ ρ u ˆ d z ρ d ζ u ˆ where u ˆ z ρ u ρ ζ ρ note that this quantity has a dimension of velocity the mean horizontal flux z ρ u ρ integrated from the bottom ρ h to ρ is equal to the vertical integral of u ˆ from the bottom d to the depth z of the density surface ρ we can therefore calculate u ˆ from u ˆ z u ρ next we define a vertical velocity associated with u ˆ by w ˆ z u ˆ with the kinematic boundary condition that w ˆ z d u ˆ d it can then be shown supplement s 2 1 that 8 w ˆ z ρ ω ρ u ˆ ζ this expression allows for a nice interpretation that this new vertical velocity w ˆ is the sum of the mean diapycnal volume flux and the vertical component of the flow along the isopycnal surface z ζ ρ x y because the residual mean circulation is projected onto z coordinates direct comparison between u ˆ w ˆ and u w is possible where denotes average at fixed z in particular we can formally attribute the difference between w and w ˆ to temporal variability 9 w w ˆ eddies because in a hypothetical state where there is no temporal variability and defining ζ z ρ y z it can be shown that u ˆ w ˆ u w we call the difference eddies but it includes all temporal variability for a more formal and conventional representation of the impacts of eddies see for example aiki and yamagata 2006 young 2012 and supplement s 2 2 2 6 volume budget we carry out the same volume budget calculation on the ofes output using exactly the same formulation as in f17 in addition we extend the calculation to density coordinates using the formulae presented in section 2 4 supplement s 3 2 extends f17 s derivation to include the use of density coordinates and to discuss numerical methods let v y be the temporal average of a zonally and vertically integrated v with its range of zonal integration from x w y to the coast and its vertical range to be specified below u y be the temporal average of a vertically and meridionally integrated horizontal velocity not just u normal to x w y with the meridional integration starting either from y s or from y n the southern or northern end of our analysis domain w y be a zonal and meridional integral of w or z ρ ω ρ on a level or density surface to be specified below with its zonal integration from x w y to the coast and its meridional integration starting either from y s or from y n with these general definitions the volume budget for the lc layer can be written as 10a v y v y n u y w y where the meridional integration is from y n to y that is the southward flow of lc v is increased by the lateral inflow u across x w y and upward volume flux w across the lower surface between y n and y in z coordinates the vertical integration is from z 0 to z d 1 and w is an integration of w on z d 1 in density coordinates the lower surface is ρ ρ 1 and w is an integration of z ρ ω ρ on it likewise for the luc layer 10b v y v y s u y w y w b y where the meridional integration is from y s to y that is the northward flow of the luc v is increased by the lateral inflow u across x w and downward w and upward w b volume fluxes across the upper z d 1 or ρ ρ 1 and lower z d b or ρ ρ b surfaces of the luc layer between y s and y note that the vertical volume flux w or z ρ ω ρ across z d 1 or ρ ρ 1 is shared by the lc and luc boxes and that the cumulative flux w is different between them only because the direction and the starting point of the meridional integration are different from y n southward for the lc layer and from y s northward for the luc layer a formal derivation of eqs 10 is found in f17 these calculations are facilitated by the quantities u and u ρ defined in section 2 4 it is noteworthy supplement s 3 2 that we use a discrete version of eqs 10 which is consistent with the model s discrete equation of continuity so that eqs 10 exactly hold for the model s discrete u w field except that the volume flux across the sea surface z 0 is assumed to vanish which is a very good approximation for a long term mean field likewise eqs 10 are exact on our discrete z ρ u ρ z ρ ω ρ field because it satisfies its own continuity equation 6 the property that x w follows edges of the model s gridboxes section 2 3 is necessary for this exact mass closure to hold deshayes et al 2014 supplement s 3 2 3 results 3 1 description in z coordinates 3 1 1 horizontal structure of the lcs fig 1 shows the horizontal velocity fields integrated over the lc and luc depth ranges and averaged over our analysis period 1993 2012 in the upper layer there is a broad poleward flow off australia from 20 s down to 24 25 s this broad flow actually consists not shown of a relatively well defined lc which is located at the shelf break and broader poleward flows offshore because the lc is relatively weak there see below and the offshore poleward flows vary from year to year not shown the long term average shows this smooth broad current south of 24 s the lc is well defined and continues around the southwestern corner and onto the south coast of australia where this flow is sometimes called the leeuwin current extension e g ridgway and condie 2004 duran et al and references therein to the south of the leeuwin current extension there is a strong westward flow south of australia the flinders current middleton and cirano 2002 and references therein which is deep extending to 3000 m hufford et al 1997 its subsurface part manifests itself as a very strong westward flow in the luc depth range in fig 1 b it appears stronger in fig 1 b than in fig 1 a because the depth range of integration is larger for the former a small fraction of the flinders current retroflects eastward at 34 s to form the luc fig 1 b unlike in f17 s geostrophic calculation on cars aus8 this retroflection does not follow the outline of the deep naturaliste plateau not shown in this mean field the plateau is deeper than the luc depth range and does not directly block the flow in some years not shown the flow shows tendencies to follow the deep bottom topography and therefore this difference between cars and ofes may be due to the smoothing of variability in this region in ofes the luc flows equatorward along the continental slope bends offshore between 23 s and 22 s and completely disappears beyond 22 s this departure of the luc from the continental slope seems to be controlled by the exmouth plateau although it is deeper than the bottom of the luc duran 2015 the departure occurs also somewhat to the south of the location where the southern edge of the plateau joins the continental slope see below there is a strong outflow from and a strong inflow into the lc at 28 5 s and 29 5 s respectively fig 1 a and a similar pair exists in the luc depth range fig 1 b in annual mean fields not shown similar mesoscale flows are more visible they tend to be vertically coherent extending to 1000 m reminiscent of the zonal jets or striations divakaran and brassington 2011 and references therein and their positions tend to vary from year to year in the average over our twenty year analysis period they tend to average out at depths leaving a series of surface trapped 0 150m eastward jets similar to menezes et al s 2014 countercurrents except for the pair of the inflow and outflow at 28 5 s and 28 9 s which has a much deeper tail 3 1 2 vertical structure of the lcs fig 2 shows zonal sections of the mean meridional velocity and potential density from ofes and from f17 s geostrophic calculation the overall vertical and horizontal structure of the lc and luc and the associated density structure are similar between cars and ofes one obvious difference is that strong mesoscale features remains in cars offshore of the lc and luc whereas they are largely canceled out by the long term averaging in ofes even though cars aus8 is a compilation of hydrographic observations over many years 1950 2012 the temporal or spatial sampling is probably insufficient to cancel out the mesoscale variability in fact the ofes annual mean field not shown includes stronger mesoscale variability similar to those in cars another difference is that the luc almost vanishes at 22 s in ofes whereas it is still strong there in cars the luc leaves the coast somewhat farther north f17 and follows the southern edge of the exmouth plateau more closely not shown in cars in both cars and ofes the lc s core is located at or somewhat offshore of the shelf break and the luc is located on the continental slope the near surface density contours slope down toward the bottom of the lc and they slope up toward the bottom of the luc both consistent with the geostrophic shear there all these characteristics are consistent with past observations e g smith et al 1991 the bottom of the mean lc stays at a relatively constant depth of 200m it is interesting that the topmost part of the luc moves to lighter density as it flows equatorward a feature noted by f17 3 1 3 zonal overturning the long term mean velocity and density fields are shifted in the x direction in such a way that x w y becomes a straight meridian section 2 3 and then their meridional averages are computed over 22 34 s fig 3 a shows the result all the characteristics of the lcs noted in the discussion of fig 2 are visible in fig 3 a except that both lc and luc appear detached from the bottom this is only because the profile of the bottom slope varies in the meridional direction the surface flow is predominantly westward which is the mean ekman drift the mean winds being predominantly equatorward not shown the weak broad poleward flow blue near the surface is a manifestation of the broad poleward flow in the north fig 2 and is consistent with geostrophy see the upward westward tilt of density contours and note that the annual mean ekman drift is very weakly equatorward not shown below the ekman layer and above 180 m is an eastward flow which feeds into the lc a small fraction of this flow upwells and feeds the westward ekman drift and the rest sinks to the luc depth range and flows westward this zonal overturning circulation is consistent with that found in cars and another eddy resolving ogcm by f17 there is a broader and weaker downwelling west of 111 7 e but remember that our x coordinate is shifted which may be part of the basin scale broad ekman downwelling subduction in the subtropical gyre e g schott et al 2002 2004 3 1 4 meridional overturning fig 3 b plots the v w field averaged between x w y and x e y which are shown as green curves in figs 1 and 2 the lc flows poleward above the equatorward flowing luc and their boundary is fairly constant in the latitudinal direction at 200m there is a downwelling near the bottom of the lc which joins the top of the luc these characteristics agree with those found for cars aus8 in f17 the lc is weakened at 28 5 s and strengthened again at 29 5 s barely visible in the figure consistent with the outflow and inflow noted for fig 1 a likewise the luc is strengthened and weakened again at 29 5 s and 28 5 s respectively by the same pair of inflow and outflow fig 1 b note that the density contours shoal poleward within the lc and most of them outcrop by 34 s consistent with the general poleward increase in sea surface density as noted for fig 2 although the top of the luc stays around 200m its density gradually decreases as it flows equatorward these relations between the currents and density are discussed in section 3 2 in greater detail 3 1 5 volume budget finally fig 4 shows the volume budgets for the lc and luc depth ranges according to eqs 10 the lc is weak at 22 s and is accelerated to its maximum transport by 25 s by the lateral inflow u consistent with the horizontal flow pattern fig 1 a the lateral inflow continues but the lc ceases to be accelerated and hence the solid and dotted curves start to diverge from 24 s instead of accelerating the lc the zonal inflow is absorbed by the sinking w it is interesting that the mesoscale features of u are mostly absorbed by the local accelerations and decelerations of the lc and the downwelling does not include much mesoscale features in total there is a lateral inflow of 2 8sv half of which is used to accelerate the lc and the other half downwells a small equatorward branch of the flinders current is the source of the luc fig 1 b and its transport is about 0 5sv at 34 s fig 4 b further north a small retroflection of the flinders current joins the luc eastward which is reflected as the lateral inflow and acceleration of the luc between 34 s and 33 5 s after that the lateral flow is generally westward out of the luc box apart from the mesoscale inflows and outflows despite this general outflow the luc is generally accelerated up to 28 s by the downwelling w from the lc layer equatorward of 28 s the outflow somewhat increases and the downwelling somewhat decreases and as a result the luc is gradually weakened finally it rapidly veers offshore between 23 s and 22 s fig 1 b there is a negligibly small upwelling w b through the bottom 900m of the luc layer mostly concentrated around 29 s which may have something to do with the relatively large deep mesoscale inflow there fig 1 in summary these volume budgets are due to two components one is the zonal and meridional overturning seen in figs 3 a and 3 b in which a broad lateral eastward inflow in the upper layer downwells into the lower layer and flows offshore westward and the other is the mostly horizontal mesoscale recirculations visible in fig 1 qualitatively this picture is the same as that of f17 the only notable qualitative difference is that the relative contribution of the lateral inflow in the south to the luc is smaller in ofes than in cars quantitatively all flows are weaker in ofes compare our fig 4 with f17 s fig 11 3 2 the structure of the lcs in density coordinates we plotted a meridional composite like fig 3 a in density coordinates not shown because the density of the lc drastically changes in the meridional direction see below the meridional composite at fixed density turned out more confusing than useful we therefore skip the zonal circulation 3 2 1 meridional circulation fig 5 shows the residual mean circulation zonally integrated over the lc band x w y x e y the contours show the zonal and temporal averages of depths of isopycnal surfaces isopycnal depths the poleward flow near the sea surface i e lighter density is the lc its upper part is largely parallel to z ρ contours and becomes denser as it flows poleward consistent with the zonal and temporal average in z coordinates fig 3 b where the water appears to flow at constant depths and to cross density contours as it flows poleward interestingly however below z ρ 100 m the diapycnal flux is very weak e g the arrows are almost horizontal in fig 5 which means that the water flows poleward and upward with z ρ decreasing along isopycnals in the lower part of the lc because diapycnal diffusion is minimal below the mixed layer section 2 1 this result in density coordinates is as expected in contrast the arrows appear to cross isopycnals in z coordinates even in the lower part of the lc fig 3 b the vertical motion is even downward near the bottom of the lc this apparent discrepancy must be due to the large poleward bend in the x y plane of isopycnal surfaces not shown which is due to the poleward advection of light warm water by the lc e g legeckis and cresswell 1981 weaver and middleton 1989 benthuysen et al 2014 in the lower part of the lc the water parcels move on average eastward and on joining the lc turn poleward all along isopycnals in this way the zonal mean meridional flow appears to be crossing the zonal mean isopycnal surfaces in z coordinates fig 3 b without actually crossing isopycnals interestingly the bottom of the lc moves to higher densities as the lc flows poleward fig 5 even though the flow itself is along isopycnals this feature is due to the eastward inflow that keeps adding volume to the lc fig 4 below the lc is the luc which flows equatorward along isopycnals the arrows being horizontal similarly to the migration of the bottom of the lc the luc s upper bound moves to lighter densities equatorward although it stays largely below 200m as shown later this extension is also due to lateral eastward inflow of lighter waters across x w that joins the top of the luc even though the overall lateral transport is outward westward if averaged over the entire luc layer fig 4 unlike in the x z and y z circulation figs 3 a and 3 b in z coordinates there is no downwelling from the lc to the luc layer 3 2 2 volume budget this weakness of diapycnal flux between the lc and luc layers is quantified in a similar volume budget calculation to fig 4 this time however no isopycnal forms a clear boundary between the lc and luc fig 5 we choose ρ 1 26 0 σ θ and ρ b 27 0 σ θ as the top and bottom of the luc in density coordinates for convenience according to fig 5 ρ 1 and ρ b respectively enter the lower parts of the lc and luc poleward of 28 s the definitions of the volume fluxes are the same as in z coordinates section 2 6 except that the vertical integration is either between the sea surface and ρ 1 or between ρ 1 and ρ b eqs 10 still hold fig 6 is the result the meridional structure of the lc transport v is similar to that in z coordinates fig 4 especially equatorward of 28 s after the large outflow at 28 5 s however the lc transport does not recover in density coordinates because of the weaker lateral inflow this suggests that most inflow seen in fig 4 poleward of 28 s occurs below ρ 1 and above z 1 depth fig 5 indeed the lateral inflow to the luc box is larger in density coordinates fig 6 b than in z coordinates fig 4 b poleward of 28 s a shortcoming because the ρ 1 26 σ θ surface is shallower than the bottom of the lc poleward of 28 s fig 5 the lc s meridional evolution is almost entirely due to the lateral inflow the slight difference south of 31 s is due to weak diapycnal upwelling across the ρ 1 surface the meridional evolution of the luc fig 6 lower panel is also similar to that in z coordinates the luc transport is somewhat weaker poleward of 29 s than in z coordinates because it now includes the small fraction of the lc below ρ 1 the lateral inflow is positive eastward on average south of 29 s likely because it now includes the part missed by the lc layer mentioned above equatorward of 28 s lateral outflow dominates and the luc is decelerated accordingly contribution from vertical exchange is negligible throughout it is reassuring that the impact of numerical diffusion is negligible suggesting that mesoscale eddies are well resolved griffies et al 2000 3 2 3 residual mean circulation projected onto z coordinates we project the residual mean flow onto z coordinates by z ζ ρ x y z ρ ρ x y section 2 5 and calculate the volume budgets for the lc and luc boxes fig 7 the vertical motion w ˆ associated with the mapped residual mean circulation is weak except for the localized downwelling at about 29 s the budget curves are more similar to those in fig 6 than to those in fig 4 because the diapycnic flux is negligible the downward motion w ˆ is interpreted as due to flow along isopycnal surfaces eq 8 the above results further indicates that the vertical component of the along isopycnal flow of u ˆ is not a major contributor to the vertical motion either at least in the present interpretation using z z ρ ρ x y for the mapping in other words 9 reduces to w w ˆ eddy u ˆ ζ eddy eddy that is mean vertical motion is mostly due to temporal variability 3 2 4 isopycnal circulation to understand what three dimensional structure of the residual mean circulation leads to the above results we plot the residual mean transport within five representative density layers fig 8 lc layer in the shallowest layer in the figure 23 5 23 6 σ θ a southwestward flow on the north west shelf holloway current d adamo et al 2009 is seen to be one of the sources of the lc a broad southward flow offshore also joins and accelerates the lc between 22 s and 24 s consistent with the lateral inflow and the acceleration of the lc in figs 4 a and 6 a according to these volume budget curves further inflow occurs between 24 s and 25 s which resides on deeper isopycnals not shown the lc in this layer gradually weakens south of 25 s and vanishes at about 28 s presumably because surface cooling by the atmosphere converts the lighter water to a heavier one figs 3 b and 5 the maximum sea surface density during the year is often higher than 24 0 σ θ over the region plotted in fig 8 the density layer we discuss now 23 5 23 6 σ θ vanishes at such times in summer the layer extends to and outcrops at 28 s which is the southernmost latitude the layer can exist south of 25 s the lc appears weak near the offshore edge the green curve because density is typically higher there than 23 6 σ θ even in summer not shown the next layer 24 4 24 5 σ θ extends to 32 s in summer it is interesting that there is a strong outflow from the lc between 28 and 29 s this flow recirculates and creates a weak countercurrent along the offshore edge of the lc this feature is visible in fig 1 a and is also the reason for the dip in the lc transport at 28 s in figs 4 a and 6 a the lost transport is partially recovered at 29 s in these volume budget plots between 29 s and 30 s because this recirculation rejoins the lc there the main onshore flow that rejoins the lc however occurs on somewhat deeper isopycnals not shown in the present density range fig 8 b the onshore flow of the recirculation is weak and occurs between 30 s and 31 s the gradual inflow and acceleration of the lc further south seen in the volume budget curves figs 4 a and 6 a is a superposition of recirculating inflows and outflows with a similarly complicated vertical structure not shown which does not lend itself to a simple description luc layer the next density layer in the figure fig 8 c includes the bottom of the lc in the south and the uppermost part of luc in the north see also fig 5 in this density layer an interior eastward flow joins the top of the luc at around 29 s this is the main source of the lighter upper luc seen in fig 5 above the 26 3 σ θ surface the additional inflow into the luc near 23 s seen in fig 5 is also visible on somewhat lighter density surfaces not shown part of the inflow immediately turns offshore between 29 s and 28 s consistent with the deceleration of the luc in the volume budget calculations figs 4 a and 6 a this offshore flow is vertically collocated with the outflow from the lc in fig 8 b although the direction of the outflow has also a southward component in the lc layer in this panel fig 8 c are plotted two mean depth z ρ contours the isopycnals deepen from the outer edge of the lc toward its core see also fig 3 a fig 8 c indicates that the onshore inflow around 29 s goes downward across the z ρ 200 m contour which is expressed as the downwelling in the volume budget calculation on the residual mean flow mapped to z coordinates fig 7 a between 23 and 22 s the luc turns westward and vanishes in the next density layer fig 8 d the luc originates from the onshore retroflection of the flinders current there is a weak outflow to the north decelerating the luc and there is some inflow between 32 and 30 s accelerating the luc again figs 4 a and 6 a between 30 and 28 s there is a pair of strong inflow and outflow creating the peak luc transport see also figs 5 and 6 b north of 26 s there is week outflow figs 4 a and 6 a and finally between 23 and 22 s the luc turns westward and vanishes the bottom of the luc fig 8 e starts also as a retroflection of the flinders current and there is an inflow at about 29 s as in the upper layers the luc however all bends offshore at 29 s and disappears there the inflow and outflow over 30 29 s and 29 28 s respectively is vertically coherent over the luc depth range figs 8 c to e further north the luc is replaced by a poleward current along the slope this current occupies the entire latitude range on deeper isopycnals not shown and is visible in fig 5 this flow extends down to 2000 m but appears to be somewhat less coherent or persistent than the lc or luc not shown in this way lighter water is added to the top of the luc in the north and heavier water leaves from the bottom of the luc in the south as a result the core of the luc appears to move to lighter density surfaces as it flows north fig 5 see also fig 2 3 2 5 overturning based on the mean field alone fig 9 a plots the residual mean velocity vertically integrated above the 26 0 σ θ surface this velocity field is very similar to the integrated velocity for the upper 200m fig 1 a except that the shading shows the u component for figs 9 a and 9 b which is because the 26 0 σ θ surface approximately follows the bottom of the lc fig 9 c shows the mean diapycnal velocity across the 26 0 σ θ surface this flux is mostly positive upward east of x w y and has a very small net contribution to the volume budget fig 6 in passing the diapycnal flux generally turns negative in the south the 26 0 σ θ surface outcrops in the south in winter not shown which suggests that lighter water is cooled and converted to heavier water resulting in downwelling in the density space on the other hand the reason for the net diapycnal upwelling east of x w is not clear what happens if the isopycnal diapycnal separation is attempted on the temporal averages in z coordinates u v and ρ this simulates a calculation of isopycnal and diapycnal flows from a climatological t s data it turns out that the horizontal velocity looks very similar to fig 9 a not shown the difference is mostly less than 30 fig 9 b its horizontal divergence fig 9 d is however 10 times as large as the true diapycnic flux and has the opposite sign fig 9 c in other words the mean field u v ρ gives both qualitatively and quantitatively wrong vertical flux that appears to be diapycnic the isopycnal flow derived from u v ρ has extra onshore flow orange brown in fig 9 b which converges at the shelf break and results in the extra diapycnic downwelling fig 9 d 4 summary and discussion 4 1 summary to understand the three dimensional structure of the circulation of the leeuwin current system lcs we construct a mean flow over twenty years in z coordinates and density coordinates from the three day snapshots of an eddy resolving ogcm the mean flow in z coordinates forms a zonal and a meridional overturning fig 3 where an eastward zonal flow enters the leeuwin current lc flows poleward and at the same time sinks to the leeuwin undercurrent luc depths flows equatorward and finally moves westward out of the lcs to quantify this circulation we set up two control volumes one on top of the other whose offshore western edges tightly fit the lc and luc and inshore edges coincide with the australian continent fig 4 the upper layer eastward flow tends to accelerate the lc but the downwelling into the luc layer absorbs a large fraction of it in the south the luc is accelerated both by the downwelling and an eastward inflow in the north it becomes weaker and eventually vanishes owing to an westward outflow despite the continuous downwelling the lc and luc transports include small scale variability which is highly correlated with the variability in zonal inflow and outflow but the downwelling is much smoother suggesting that the small scale features are all horizontal recirculations all these results agree with those of furue et al 2017 f17 who analyzed a geostrophic velocity field based on a gridded hydrography as well as the velocity field of another eddy resolving model on the other hand the mean flow in density coordinates is mostly isopycnic except that the upper part of the lc becomes denser presumably partly owing to sea surface cooling as it flows poleward fig 5 see also figs 8 a and b it is interesting that the lower part of the lc becomes denser not because of cooling but because denser water joins the lc from the interior ocean see also fig 8 c the luc also becomes lighter as it flows equatorward because the lower part leaves the luc fig 8 e and eastward flows join the top of the luc from the interior fig 8 c volume budget calculations are carried out on the residual mean flow fig 6 using the same control volumes except that the vertical boundary between the lc and luc layers are set to a constant density consistent with the very small explicit diapycnal diffusion below the mixed layer in the model diapycnal volume flux is negligible between the lc and luc layers the changes in volume transports of the lc and luc are almost entirely controlled by lateral inflow and outflow in each layer this mean flow pattern coincides with some of the pathways of domingues et al s 2007 lagrangian floats the residual mean transport field fig 8 indicates that the part of the eastward flow that enters the lc box just flows poleward and the other part that enters the luc box just flows equatorward on the other hand the residual mean flow does not include the flow pattern f17 s volume budget analysis implied the interior eastward flow would enter the lc box and the large fraction of it would sink into the luc box before exiting the luc westward f17 s conjecture that the equatorward lightening of the luc is due to the downwelling from the lc layer is therefore wrong the downwelling across the 200 m isobath in the z coordinate average is a result of temporal variability not a property of the isopycnal mean flow finally to simulate a geostrophic calculation on climatological hydrography we test what would happen if only long term mean fields in z coordinates were available fig 9 it turns out that a large downwelling across the mean density surface is predicted from the bottom of the lc this result also supports the idea that the actual mean downwelling in z coordinates without diapycnal flux is possible owing to temporal correlation between velocity and isopycnal depths 4 2 discussion 4 2 1 kinematics of the downwelling this situation is reminiscent of that of the so called deacon cell döös and webb 1994 and references therein the zonally integrated streamfunction in z coordinates from a global ocean gcm is known to include a deep meridional overturning cell across the equatorward edge of the antarctic circumpolar current with strong downwelling and upwelling at around 40 s and 60 s respectively manabe et al 1990 this downwelling was especially puzzling because it appeared to cross mean isopycnal surfaces this mean vertical motion however turned out to be the vertical component of the mean motion of water parcels along zonally tilted isopycnal surfaces upon zonal average along isopycnal surfaces the equatorward and poleward motions almost cancel out each other and the overturning cell almost disappears in density coordinates döös et al 2008 for this reason this cell is sometimes called spurious e g mcintosh and mcdougall 1996 this situation is schematically depicted in fig 10 b with axes a and b interpreted as x and y respectively in the present study downwelling is also isopycnic fig 6 fig 10 a shows the eastward running integral from 105 e in the shifted x coordinate section 2 3 of w across 200m integrated over 34 22 s in the interior ocean there is a weak downwelling which is probably the manifestation of the interior subduction e g schott et al 2002 2004 there is also a weak upwelling just west of x w both these upwelling and downwelling are visible in fig 3 a there is then the stronger downwelling west of x w on average therefore the water parcel that flows into the lc sinks and exits the lcs when or where the isopycnal surface is deeper it stays deep at least in our study region and its upwelling may require heating at low latitudes as in the regular subtropical cell e g mccreary and lu 1994 for this reason this sinking may not be spurious in the sense of the deacon cell if that is the case this flow may be regarded as a form of subduction the mechanism of the sinking however does not seem to be a downslope flow along mean isopycnals as in regular subduction but due to temporal variability as discussed above a plausible scenario is this the particle moves eastward near the surface the water converges at the continental slope and the density layer the particle belongs to becomes thicker which results in a downward vertical velocity within the density layer the particle then sinks turns westward and exits the lcs at a deeper depth as a result the eastward and westward velocities cancel in density coordinates on temporal average that would be the reason that the horizontal convergence of the mean horizontal transports which is equal to the mean diapycnic velocity is weak in density coordinates if the thinning phase of the density layer were perfectly symmetric with the thickening phase there should be a mean upward motion that would cancel the downward motion in the thickening phase on temporal average but the fact that w 0 suggests that when the layer thins the associated upward motion is weaker for some reason if there were no mean flow the water particle would return to a shallow depth when the layer thins forming a small circular trajectory if so there would be a matching upwelling just west of x w the fact that the upwelling west of x w does not entirely cancel the downward flux fig 10 a suggests that some of the particles are entrained in a mean downward flow perhaps that of the interior subduction what drives such a flow associated with eddies is not clear neither is it clear whether the notion that this flow is driven by eddies is apt or not we do not know after all what the hypothetical eddy less state would look like our analysis is totally kinematic lacking any dynamical interpretation if mesoscale eddies and the resultant downwelling are a crucial dynamical ingredient that might explain why benthuysen et al s 2014 ogcm did not reproduce a luc while it produced a strong lc 4 2 2 jet like inflow and outflow the large scale poleward sea level drop in the south indian ocean godfrey and ridgway 1985 maximenko and niiler 2005 suggests a broad eastward geostrophic flow near the sea surface some studies e g menezes et al 2014 however find a set of jet like eastward flows instead as suggested by f17 this feature may be a superposition of a shallow 200 m broad eastward geostrophic flow and a set of deep 1000 m eastward and westward jets because they are deep these jets contribute to the small scale features not only in the lc but also in the luc figs 4 and 8 the comparison of these small scale structures between numerical models and observations is tricky as observations include remnants of mesoscale noise and these jets are not necessarily stationary such deep jets or striations are ubiquitous in the world ocean e g divakaran and brassington 2011 taguchi et al 2012 whereas some jets seem to be generated in the interior ocean nakano and hasumi 2005 qiu et al 2013 and some migrate in the meridional direction richards et al 2006 some seem to be quasi stationary and generated at the eastern boundary by the instability of coastal currents davis et al 2014 their positions presumably fixed by coastal features this or similar mechanism may exist at the west coast of australia generating the quasi stationary jets we see 4 3 concluding remarks the present study raises a number of questions what is the dynamical significance if any of the euler mean downwelling what is the nature of the temporal variability that give rise to the downwelling in z coordinates although we have loosely called it eddies other types of variabilities may contribute in particular the depths of isopycnals have a clear seasonal cycle which might play some role also how is this overturning circulation closed if the downwelling is a form of subduction the downwelled water may be joining the shallow overturning circulation schott et al 2002 describes what is the fate of the luc after it has left the continental slope the luc water seems to keep flowing westward after leaving the coast instead of following the outline of the exmouth plateau and returning to the australian coast not shown on a more technical note how would the error in the diagnosed mean diapycnic velocity change if the sampling interval were shorter or longer our sampling interval of three days is most likely sufficient considering that the diagnosed diapycnal flux is small section 3 and that the strongest variability in our model at a 1 10 resolution under daily mean forcings section 2 is likely due to mesoscale eddies a necessary sampling interval for a higher resolution model under higher frequency forcings or an optimal sampling interval to save storage space while minimizing error may be an interesting subject of study f17 compared the volume budget like fig 4 between another eddy resolving model ofam3 oke et al 2013 and a geostrophic velocity field based on the gridded hydrography cars aus8 described in section 2 2 if we now add the present result from ofes to the comparison we can see that both ofam3 and ofes qualitatively agree with cars but quantitatively the flows are systematically weaker in the ogcms than in cars this is an interesting difference do we need more horizontal resolution for example for ogcms to improve the flow field of the lcs wijeratne et al 2018 analyzed an ogcm with a 3 4km resolution and found significantly larger lc transports than in our ogcms even though this is not a clean comparison because the zonal and vertical extents of integration are somewhat different it is also interesting that the structure of the self break currents along the south coast of australia such as the leeuwin current extension has some similarity to that of the lc there is indeed a systematic mean downwelling averaged in z coordinates from the surface layer that includes the eastward flowing shelf break currents to a deeper layer where there seem to exist a westward flowing undercurrent duran et al acknowledgments the

24033,we present a new energy backscatter parametrization for primitive equation ocean models at eddy permitting resolution specifically for unstructured grids traditional eddy parametrizations in terms of viscosity closures lead to excessive dissipation of kinetic energy when used with eddy permitting meshes implemented into the fesom2 ocean model the backscatter parametrization leads to a more realistic total dissipation of kinetic energy it maintains a reservoir of dissipated energy and reinjects this subgrid energy at larger scales at a controlled rate the separation between dissipation and backscatter scales is achieved by using different order differential operators and or spatial smoothing this ensures numerical model stability we perform sensitivity studies with different choices of parameter settings and viscosity schemes in a configuration with a baroclinically unstable flow in a zonally reentrant channel with a horizontally uniform mesh the best backscatter setup substantially improves eddy permitting simulations at 1 4 and 1 6 resolution bringing them close to a 1 12 eddy resolving reference improvements are largest for levels of kinetic energy and variability in temperature and vertical velocity a selected optimal default scheme is then tested in a mixed resolution setup a channel with narrow transitions between an eddy permitting and an eddy resolving subdomain the backscatter scheme is able to adapt dynamically to the different resolutions and moves the diagnostics closer to the high resolution reference throughout the domain our study is a first step toward using backscatter in global variable mesh ocean models and suggests potential for substantial improvements of ocean mean state and variability at reduced computational cost keywords kinetic energy backscatter subgrid eddy parametrization inverse energy cascade viscosity closure eddy permitting resolution 1 introduction mesoscale eddies contribute to the transport of heat and tracers in many regions of the ocean e g griffies et al 2015 jayne and marotzke 2002 they affect the shape and temporal behavior of the ocean currents e g kirtman et al 2012 and modify the atmosphere ocean exchange e g bryan et al 2010 frenger et al 2016 roberts et al 2016 they further play a crucial role in the response to changes in atmospheric forcing in a warming climate and can for example counteract the effect of increasing westerlies on the southern ocean circumpolar current munday et al 2013 the resolution of any ocean or atmosphere model defines to a large degree which processes can be explicitly resolved and which need to be parametrized i e represented through theoretical or heuristic equations that describe the mean impact of unresolved subgrid processes on the resolved mean flow the traditional approach to simulating subgrid mesoscale turbulence is via the gent mcwilliams parametrization gent and mcwilliams 1990 in the tracer equations and an eddy viscosity closure in the momentum equation when mesoscale eddies are resolved only the latter is used it simulates the effects of baroclinic instability due to subgrid structures and maintains model stability by dissipating enstrophy at the grid scale danilov et al 2019 however if resolution is insufficient horizontal viscosity closures while dissipating enstrophy at small scales are also excessively dissipating energy they are thereby degrading the effective resolution of the ocean model even further by damping eddy structures and reducing mean and eddy kinetic energy at 1 resolution still in use today in many climate models taylor et al 2012 the gent mcwilliams parametrization is widely used to simulate the mean impact of unresolved eddies on potential energy release present day global ocean models used for climate research generally move toward an ocean grid resolution of 1 4 haarsma et al 2016 which is eddy permitting over broad ocean domains such models start to resolve mesoscale turbulence the size of mesoscale eddies however depends on the first internal rossby radius which varies from a few kilometers on shelves in the high latitudes to around 100 km at around 10 n 10 s hallberg 2013 sein et al 2017 according to hallberg 2013 the local rossby radius should be resolved with at least two mesh points to represent eddies and even finer resolution may be needed to reduce over dissipation on scales where physical instabilities occur soufflet et al 2016 thus only the largest eddies are fully resolved on 1 4 meshes and most of the mesoscale eddy activity remains part of the unresolved subgrid an eddy permitting model is able to represent some of the inverse energy cascade whereby energy is transferred from smaller to larger scales a process predicted in theory danilov et al 2019 and observed in the ocean e g scott and wang 2005 wang et al 2015 although the arguments for the underlying physical mechanisms driving an inverse cascade may vary depending on the analyzed flow regime its existence has been observed in many studies see e g wang et al 2015 and references therein the challenge of eddy permitting meshes comes from combining resolved eddies in low latitudes with unresolved i e parametrized eddies in high latitudes through wide areas where eddies could be simulated but suffer from excessive damping by the viscosity closure in the real ocean mesoscale eddy kinetic energy is removed from the system by many processes such as bottom friction and dissipation in the mixed layer with the horizontal viscosity contribution being small to improve eddy permitting ocean models the ideal concept is to keep the level and distribution of kinetic energy dissipation close to what is observed in the real ocean where horizontal viscous energy dissipation is much smaller than in the models conceptually this means that energy dissipated due to horizontal viscosity needs to be reintroduced into the system without violating model stability one of the main constraints for any numerical simulation as the inverse energy cascade is at least partly resolved at eddy permitting resolution this gives an opportunity to inject energy back into the system at scales larger than those of dissipation and make use of this inverse energy cascade in the sense of energy backscatter i e energy transferred from smaller back to larger scales energizing the entire spectrum of wavenumbers the concept of energy backscatter parametrizations has a long history danilov et al 2019 frederiksen and davies 1997 jansen and held 2014 jansen et al 2015 kitsios et al 2013 predominantly in the context of idealized setups energy backscatter parametrizations have also been used in the atmospheric sciences and in global atmospheric models berner et al 2009 leutbecher et al 2017 shutts 2005 in this context backscatter parametrizations are to a large degree used as a tool for estimating the uncertainty due to the lack of information about the unresolved scales in particular stochastic backscatter can be used to inflate the dynamical growth of model ensemble spread shutts 2005 recently in the context of increased ocean model resolution the idea of backscatter as an energetically consistent closure has gathered new momentum and generated promising results in idealized ocean model simulations jansen et al 2015 klöwer et al 2018 the approaches in these studies are making efficient use of the special situation of model resolution we currently encounter in ocean models energy backscatter can be employed to reinject energy and improve both the mean and variability of connected model quantities the next step is to investigate the impact of ocean kinetic energy backscatter in full primitive equation global ocean models a wide variety of ocean models are currently used in coupled climate models applying different parametrizations discretizations resolutions and dynamical cores the finite element sea ice ocean model fesom danilov et al 2004 wang et al 2014 was the first multiresolution global ocean model coupled to an atmospheric component in a climate model setup rackow et al 2018 sidorenko et al 2015 it allows to locally vary grid resolutions by designing telescoped i e locally increased resolution triangular meshes the advantage is that mesh refinement can be made where it is necessary for example to locally resolve the mesoscale eddy field sein et al 2016 sein et al 2017 fesom has moved to a finite volume dynamical core in fesom2 in variable grid simulations the effect of a coarse domain region upstream or nearby may still be visible in the high resolution areas see danilov and wang 2015 sein et al 2016 backscatter parametrizations may be used to partly compensate for these effects making fesom and fesom2 an ideal testbed to implement study and improve backscatter parametrizations not only on classical equidistant grids but also on more challenging grids with varying resolution on such grids backscatter is expected to be most active in the low resolution parts helping to energize the flow there and consequently also in the downstream higher resolution regions in this paper we provide a systematic evaluation of different backscatter implementations in the context of fesom2 in a 3d zonally reentrant channel setup our backscatter model as in jansen et al 2015 applies an unresolved kinetic energy uke equation to the scalar uke field which keeps track of the energy dissipated by the viscous operator making it available for reinjection into the momentum equation different from jansen et al 2015 we use a three dimensional rather than vertically averaged two dimensional uke field we test the backscatter setup on horizontally uniform and variable meshes and for different viscosity parametrizations with temporally and spatially varying viscosity coefficients we compare the eddy permitting simulations with and without backscatter with a high resolution eddy resolving reference to investigate the impact of the backscatter on mean and eddy kinetic energy but also on flow variability in quantities such as temperature and vertical velocity the paper is structured as follows in section 2 we introduce the model and the experimental setup we also introduce the viscosity parametrization options and present the new backscatter parametrizations including relevant parameters section 3 discusses simulations with backscatter on two uniform grids of 1 4 and 1 6 resolution and compares them to an eddy resolving reference of 1 12 resolution we further explore the sensitivity of the backscatter parametrization to different parameter settings and identify an optimal default scheme in section 4 we test the default scheme in a mixed resolution setup we compare simulations with and without backscatter focusing on the transitions between high and low resolution mesh domains section 5 discusses the results and their potential with regard to global ocean simulations 2 model and backscatter parametrization 2 1 model setup the model used for this study is the current version of fesom2 danilov et al 2017 it solves the primitive equations using triangular surface meshes and a cell vertex quasi b grid discretization with tracers sea surface height and vertical velocities on mesh vertices and horizontal velocities on triangle centroids details to the model setup temporal discretization and the advection schemes can be found in danilov et al 2017 here we use a simplified setup that does not include the sea ice model and uses a linear equation of state with temperature being the only advected scalar field the classical ocean momentum equation is given by 1 t u u u w z u f u 1 ρ 0 p v u z a v z u with u u v the horizontal velocity field w the vertical velocity time t vertical coordinate z x y the horizontal gradient operator coriolis parameter f u v u reference water density ρ 0 pressure p vertical viscosity coefficient a v which is specified by the vertical mixing parametrization in fesom2 and horizontal subgrid viscosity parametrization v to be discussed further we use the usual quadratic frictional stress term as the bottom boundary condition where a v z u c d u u with c d 0 001 no wind stress is applied at the surface with regard to viscous stresses at vertical walls free slip boundary conditions were applied impermeability at the boundaries is always implied furthermore for the biharmonic operator there is one more boundary condition we set to zero contributions from boundary edges in eq b 6 which is equivalent to the assumption that the velocity derivative in the direction of the boundary u n is zero the flow is maintained by temperature relaxation near the boundaries via the temperature equation 2 t t u t z w t z k v z t γ t clim t the density ρ is given by the linear equation of state 3 ρ ρ 0 1 α t t 0 here t denotes the temperature t 0 its reference value k v the vertical diffusivity provided by the vertical mixing parametrization t clim the given climatological temperature distribution γ the relaxation parameter different from zero only in narrow zones see section 2 3 and α is the thermal expansion coefficient in the linear equation of state horizontal diffusivity is provided by the transport scheme which combines 3rd order upwind with weight 0 25 and 4th order centered with weight 0 75 fluxes heat fluxes through all surfaces are assumed to be zero the setup of the numerical experiments will be explained further in section 2 3 together with the selection of γ and t clim 2 2 backscatter scheme the focus of this study is the subgrid closure for the momentum equation of the ocean model eq 1 is augmented to include a negative viscosity term that acts as kinetic energy backscatter the new momentum equation reads 4 t u u u w z u f u 1 ρ 0 p v u b u z a v z u with b u as the backscatter term it should be emphasized here that the backscatter term b u is not designed to represent the physical inverse energy transfer from unresolved to resolved scales in the sense of an inverse cascade near the model grid s truncation scale instead it is a numerically stable method to compensate for the unphysical forward energy transfer caused by the viscous closure v u this is achieved by reinjecting excessively dissipated kinetic energy on larger scales and making use of the already resolved inverse energy cascade to allow the resolved flow dynamics to simulate well developed mesoscale turbulence see also the discussion in jansen et al 2015 in the following we will discuss the design of both the viscosity term v u and the backscatter term b u 2 2 1 viscosity parametrization v u on triangular meshes triangles with a common edge differ in the orientation relative to one another for example on regular triangular grids one can imagine that a central triangle is pointing northwards with one of its tips while all three neighboring triangles are pointing southwards with one of their tips the neighboring triangles are effectively rotated by 180 relative to the central triangle this may lead to a grid mode grid imprinting for discrete quantities located on triangles see also danilov et al 2017 since the horizontal velocities of fesom2 are defined as volume averages over triangular prisms they may suffer from such a mode in order to keep it under control a special form of viscous dissipation operator is needed capable of dissipating a grid pattern in velocity fesom2 is therefore run with approximate harmonic and biharmonic operators detailed in appendix b which act strongly dissipatively on the grid mode and are thus capable of effectively suppressing it for simulations of turbulent flows we seek such a viscous operator that would provide minimum dissipation consistent with numerical stability in this study we test two different viscosity schemes in the following we will only discuss the reynolds type viscosity scheme that showed the best results as discussed in section 3 the alternative leith viscosity parametrization is detailed in appendix a the reynolds type viscosity uses the discrete biharmonic operator given by eq b 6 with a coefficient for each grid cell c 5 ν c b s c ν c r with ν c r max u 0 r u c s c 30 here s c is the area of the top of the prism c u 0 r 0 2 m s is a velocity scale selected experimentally as well as the factor 1 30 and u c is the cell horizontal velocity for large velocities this form of dissipation is similar to that of the third order upwind scheme but with a reduced coefficient we note that ν c r has the dimension of a harmonic viscosity it keeps the cell reynolds number constant throughout the simulation hence the superscript r 2 2 2 energetic considerations of v u to know how much uke is available for reinjection into the resolved flow we need to know how much energy has been dissipated by the viscous operator the energy dissipation rate due to horizontal viscosity at a given location in space x and time t in the continuum is given by 6 v u v u this expression is not sign definite and it only leads to consistent energy dissipation when averaged over the entire domain the subgrid viscous force v is the divergence of the subgrid viscous stress tensor σ i e v σ in the case of the classical harmonic viscosity σ 2 ν ε tr ε with ε 1 2 u u t so that the local rate of energy dissipation v takes the form 7 v u σ σu 2 ν ε tr ε 2 σu v where v is nonpositive a similar relation holds for the biharmonic viscosity v and v will become equal if averaged over some area such that the flux contribution σu becomes small both forms of the dissipation rate i e the full form v or the nonpositive form v can be used in calculations of uke available for backscatter and their discrete analogs are given in appendix b the advantage of the original form v is that it contains the full viscous energy contribution however it contains grid scale flux contributions and has to be smoothed before it is applied to computations of uke spatial smoothing is done by applying the filters defined in appendix c because of the properties of the discretization and the selection of viscous operators dissipation related to mesoscale turbulence is accompanied by dissipation of the grid mode of the cell vertex discretization this is common for staggered discretizations on unstructured meshes and may lead to increased dissipation on the grid scale 2 2 3 backscatter parametrization b u conceptually the term b u in eq 4 reinjects the energy that is excessively dissipated by the viscous parametrization but on a larger spatial scale and at a controlled rate over time in fully developed quasi geostrophic turbulence viscosity is thought to dissipate enstrophy near the truncation scale while energy dissipation is small hence by reinjecting energy at larger scales we shift the dynamics toward such a well developed turbulent state in this new equilibrium excessive energy dissipation is substantially reduced the system still dissipates a sufficient amount of enstrophy to prevent model instabilities our backscatter operator takes the form of the approximate harmonic operator given by eq b 2 except that its coefficient has the opposite sign to the coefficient of a viscosity parametrization and that its magnitude is related to the amount of available uke in our model the scalar uke field e e x z t defined on cells c follows the prognostic equation 8 t e c dis e dis e back ν c e the first term on the right c dis e dis is the resolved kinetic energy dissipation rate the second describes the rate at which uke is returned back to the resolved flow through backscatter and the last is some uke harmonic diffusion with coefficient ν c c s c s r 1 2 600 m 2 s at a specific cell c which follows jansen et al 2015 but is scaled due to changes in grid resolution with s r 5 8 109 m2 the area of a reference triangle since we apply smoothing to the first two terms additional uke diffusion is small and will not be discussed in detail note that our uke field varies in z as well in contrast to jansen et al 2015 who applied vertical averaging to the uke contributions the same is true for the spatially varying viscosity coefficient used in this study in our setup this choice is physically more realistic as the observed rates of dissipation and backscatter are about 1 3 smaller in the bottom layer than at the surface see section 3 3 2 below uke advection is neglected since it is not clear whether uke should simply be advected by the mean flow jansen et al 2015 have shown that even without uke advection the backscatter parametrization can achieve good results adding an advective term will increase computational costs but more importantly will affect model stability dissipation of resolved kinetic energy by the spatial and temporal discretization schemes is also neglected here and may be considered in future studies furthermore we do not dissipate uke through an additional term in eq 8 in line with jansen et al 2015 adding such a dissipative term could be seen as an alternative approach which we did not follow in this study instead the fact that some energy dissipates is modeled by the coefficient c dis which takes values between 0 and 1 and determines which fraction of the energy that is removed from the resolved flow enters the uke budget the coefficient c dis varies in time and space and follows the design by klöwer et al 2018 where 9 c dis u 1 r u r dis 1 with r u d r u f the local rossby number calculated for each cell by a discrete estimate of the local horizontal deformation rate 10 d r u x u y v 2 y u x v 2 where x and y are local zonal and meridional directions and u u v r dis is a tunable scaling parameter that defines for which flow regime distinguished by the local rossby number dissipated energy will enter the uke large values i e values greater than one correspond to a more effective recycling of dissipated kinetic energy see klöwer et al 2018 for a detailed discussion the first two terms in eq 8 can be calculated in two different ways the first is to use the respective tendency contributions from viscosity and backscatter directly and take the dot product with the local value of u this yields the sign non definite form corresponding to the v form of eq 7 however for reasons of numerical stability it is desirable to keep these contributions sign definite i e to have local uke injection by the viscosity term and local uke removal by the backscatter term this is achieved by applying spatial filtering as described in appendix c v is not necessarily sign definite only its area mean is non positive likewise the local values of harmonic backscatter are not sign definite injection of energy is only achieved in an area mean sense the second alternative is to use a sign definite form i e the v form of the respective terms to ensure positivity of uke as well as numerical stability sign definite forms of their respective operators were also used by jansen et al 2015 and klöwer et al 2018 the corresponding sign definite discrete forms for our scheme are detailed in appendices b 1 and b 2 in both cases spatial filtering is used for the following reasons the viscous dissipation rate may include contributions from a grid mode cf the discussion at the end of section 2 2 1 and so does the backscatter term as it is based on the same differencing scheme we do not want grid scales to be emphasized by the backscatter and carried into the subgrid energy equation spatial filtering of the tendencies will smooth it spatial filtering can be used for scale separation see also berloff 2018 smoothing of the backscatter term and the uke will ensure that the backscatter scheme is active at different larger scales than the corresponding unfiltered viscous operator some scale separation can also be achieved by using the less scale selective harmonic operator for the backscatter and the more scale selective biharmonic operator for the viscous parametrization see jansen et al 2015 for the sign indefinite form of the energy contributions spatial filtering will reduce the relative amplitude of the flux term in eq 7 if filtering is large enough the contributions from the flux term become small making the remaining energy tendency almost sign definite hence bringing v closer to v the spatial filter applied here is the one described in eq c 3 this filter has a spatial scale that depends on the grid as it incorporates only information from neighboring grid points its advantage is a minimal halo size for exchange of information across processor boundaries which is crucial for massively parallel implementations thus the first two terms in the uke model eq 8 for cell c take the form 11a c dis e dis c f n 1 c c c dis v c with v c u v u c u v b u c for the uke source and 11b e back c f n 2 c c b c with b c u b u c u c f n 3 c c v b u c for the uke sink f n denotes n cycles of the smoothing filter eq c 3 n 1 n 2 and n 3 are the experimentally selected numbers of smoothing cycles summation over the repeated index c is implied these expressions are written out for the reynolds viscosity scheme where v b denotes the discrete biharmonic operator eq b 6 with coefficient given by eq 5 and v b denotes the discrete harmonic backscatter operator eq b 2 with the coefficient scaled by the local uke amplitude e c 12 ν c b c 0 s c max 2 e c 0 0 the constant c 0 determines how quickly the dissipated energy is reinjected into the resolved flow i e it controls the temporal response of the parametrization the maximum function ensures that the backscatter is only active when there is a local reservoir of uke physically negative values of e c correspond to a local depletion of uke and can potentially occur because both the backscatter and the viscosity operators act on different scales for the leith viscosity scheme v b in eq 11a must be replaced by the sum of the harmonic operator v eq b 2 with coefficient given by eq a 1 and the biharmonic background operator v b eq b 6 with coefficient given by eq a 2 see appendix a finally the actual discrete backscatter contribution to the momentum equation eq 4 takes the form 13 b c u f n 3 c c v b u c note that the smoothing filter applied in the computation of b c in eq 11b must also be used in the backscatter tendency contribution b c u to remove the grid mode from the operator alternatively we may replace v c and b c in eqs 11a and 11b by their sign definite alternatives eqs b 4 and b 7 we retain the smoothing filters to potentially increase the scales on which the backscatter acts the backscatter term in the momentum equation also retains its smoothing filter to prevent backscatter into the grid mode the sign definite formulation typically requires fewer smoothing cycles i e smaller values of n 1 n 2 and n 3 as a consequence of these different choices we end up with four separate backscatter implementations two with sign definite energy tendencies v and two with non definite ones v one of each for the leith and one for the reynolds viscosity schemes appendix a and section 2 2 1 respectively we will further discuss the effect of different filter cycle choices the coefficients r dis and c 0 and the choice of the backscatter implementation in section 3 2 below 2 3 experimental setup we simulate a zonally reentrant baroclinically unstable flow in a channel with walls at 30 n and 45 n and spherical geometry as for global model simulations the grid is rotated with the rotated pole over greenland located at 40 w 75 n the channel has 24 unevenly spaced vertical layers with thicknesses ranging from 10 m at the surface to 100 m for the last few layers going down to the constant depth of 1600 m the flow is analyzed in two distinct sets of experimental setups that differ in their meshes and zonal extent described below for both sets of experiments when varying the horizontal resolution the vertical resolution is kept constant to enable a better comparison of the effect of increased horizontal resolution vs the backscatter parametrization both sets of experiments use the same temperature relaxation to force the mean flow this takes place in 1 5 strips at the northern and the southern boundaries the relaxation parameter γ in eq 2 takes the value 1 3 days directly at the boundary and is linearly reduced to zero at 43 5 and 31 5 respectively the reference temperature climatology t clim to which the temperature near the boundaries is relaxed is the same as the temperature initial condition which is linear with vertical gradient of 8 10 3 k m and meridional gradient of 0 5 10 5 k m the surface temperature at the southern boundary is 25 c initial velocities are zero a small temperature perturbation the structure of which is not relevant for the discussion of the results is added to the initial state to create small instabilities that quickly grow on a mean eastward flow all runs reach a statistically steady state of kinetic energy within the first year the first set of experiments compares three equidistant meshes with resolutions of 1 4 1 6 and 1 12 corresponding to triangle areas of about 270 km2 120 km2 and 30 km2 the zonal extent of the channel is 20 the lower resolution runs were performed with and without backscatter the high resolution run is used as a reference without backscatter the rossby radius is about 25 km so that the 1 4 and 1 6 grids are eddy permitting while the 1 12 grid is eddy resolving for the 1 4 setup different viscosity and backscatter schemes were tested in short 5 year integrations the default backscatter and viscosity configurations selected after carrying out the sensitivity studies of the 1 4 setup see section 3 are extended to a total of ten years each to improve statistics which are well equilibrated over this period timestep lengths for the 1 4 1 6 and 1 12 grid configurations are 15 min 10 min and 1 min respectively these choices are relatively conservative i e small especially for the 1 12 grid configuration a moderate increase of timestep did not significantly affect the results not shown the second set of experiments has a zonal extent of 40 to accommodate subdomains of different resolution the horizontal grid is unstructured and has a high and a low resolution part with two transition regions at 7 5 and 32 5 longitude see fig 1 of danilov and wang 2015 and later in this paper fig 8 the resolution varies from 1 12 in the high resolution domain to around 1 3 in the low resolution part incorporating both eddy permitting and eddy resolving grids two simulations are carried out with and without the default backscatter parametrization discussed in section 3 for the equidistant grid the general setup of the experimental domain corresponds to setup a of danilov and wang 2015 simulation length is 10 years with the timestep set to 1 min as a high resolution reference for these simulations we use the same 1 12 equidistant mesh setup with zonal extent of 20 as in the first set of experiments further details on the parameter choices of all experimental setups of this study especially for the viscosity and backscatter parametrizations can be found in the next sections 3 and 4 and are summarized in table 1 2 4 diagnostics diagnostics are based on daily mean data if not stated otherwise which provides sufficient temporal resolution the first year of each simulation is excluded as spinup unless stated otherwise we focus on zonally averaged surface mean and temporal standard deviation fields vertical layer averaged mean and temporal standard deviation fields and total integrated fields over different vertical levels eddy kinetic energy eke is here defined as the kinetic energy ke of the velocity fluctuations after removing the temporal model mean state 3 equidistant grid simulations 3 1 reference simulations without backscatter for the reference simulations we use the discrete form of the reynolds viscosity operator eq b 2 with coefficient given by eq 5 in our experiments this choice resulted in the least amount of spurious dissipation and the least amount of grid scale noise even on high resolution unstructured grids we will discuss the effect of the leith compared to the reynolds parametrization in section 3 2 1 below the circulation at 1 12 resolution is characterized by a mean eastward flow with a mean ke peak between about 38 n and a trough at about 31 n and right at the northern boundary fig 1d where the troughs can be seen as artificially forced by the temperature boundary layer relaxation the temperature relaxation forcing is also visible as a steep gradient in zonally averaged temperature close to the southern boundary fig 1a snapshots of sea surface temperature sst sea surface height ssh surface vorticity and vertical velocity w at 100 m depth reveal that turbulence is strongest in the middle of the channel fig 1 right two columns eddy size varies from larger to smaller going northward in accordance with the increase of the coriolis parameter vertical velocity fig 1f is the most sensitive field when it comes to grid scale noise some small wave like structures are visible in w but not in the other fields increased viscosity would damp these waves but also reduce the simulated variability and provide a less competitive reference for the backscatter comparing resolutions of 1 4 1 6 and 1 12 with focus on zonal temporal mean ke and eke reveals that there is not only a strong resolution dependence of the amplitude of eke but also of its meridional location and of the feedback of eddies on the mean ke fig 2 while layer averaged ke and especially eke amplitudes generally increase with increasing resolution the resolution change also impacts the general flow structure at 1 12 the flow has only one major meridional peak seen both in mean eke and ke at 1 4 and 1 6 the flow has two distinct peaks at slightly different locations around 32 and 40 n at 1 4 resolution and around 32 34 and 40 42 n at 1 6 resolution increasing resolution from 1 4 to 1 6 spreads out the two peaks but the additional eddy forcing at 1 6 is still not strong enough to break the bimodal flow structure and create the unimodal flow seen at 1 12 in the vertical an increase in horizontal resolution from 1 4 to 1 6 and finally to 1 12 leads to an intensification of ke eke by a factor of around 1 5 2 between the coarsest and the finest resolution in all layers fig 3 similar differences are seen in the layer averaged temporal standard deviations of temperature and w fig 3 right two columns we note that ke and eke increase monotonically from bottom to surface the standard deviation of temperature has peaks near bottom and surface and a minimum at a depth of about 600 800 m the opposite is true for variations in w which are most intense at mid depth and weakest near the surface and the bottom total surface ke varies substantially between resolutions fig 3 left column fig 4a at 1 12 resolution it is about 1 5 times larger than at 1 4 and about 1 2 times larger than at 1 6 this change is accompanied by an increase of the temporal variability in the total ke vertical lines in fig 4a 3 2 impact of backscatter sensitivity studies to test the backscatter scheme several parameter choices have to be made which we will briefly discuss we study the effect of these choices in structured sensitivity studies a summary of the simulations carried out for the sensitivity studies is given in table 1 3 2 1 viscosity schemes to provide baseline benchmarks we carried out a set of simulations without backscatter but with different viscosity schemes and different resolutions the biharmonic reynolds viscosity scheme is taken as described in section 2 2 1 the harmonic leith scheme with additional biharmonic background viscosity see appendix a has a tunable coefficient of minimum viscosity ν 0 we tested different values at 1 4 resolution the reynolds viscosity scheme shows the least depletion of total ke the two leith viscosity settings with minimum viscosities of ν 0 500 and 2000 m2 s 1 perform slightly worse with respect to minimizing spurious dissipation while remaining numerically stable fig 4a increased minimum viscosity tends to stabilize the leith viscosity scheme but also reduces total ke slightly fig 4a consequently we select the reynolds viscosity as our default viscosity scheme 3 2 2 viscosity backscatter combinations related to the choice of the viscosity is the backscatter implementation as it uses the viscous energy dissipation to estimate the amount of uke available for the backscatter even though the leith scheme without backscatter tends to be more dissipative than the reynolds scheme in combination with backscatter the leith scheme over energizes the flow and produces far too much surface ke in the 1 4 setup when compared to the high resolution reference ref 1 12 consequently the reynolds scheme performs generally better with backscatter than the leith scheme fig 4d still the leith scheme also equilibrates within the five year run and does not spin up infinitely figs 4d and 5c looking at the detailed daily averaged energy tendency contributions we see that in the leith case backscatter tends to inject more energy than viscosity removes fig 5c even though the excessive injection of energy is small at the surface it is relative to the rate of viscous dissipation much larger in the subsurface and near the bottom while the backscatter equation eqs 8 and 12 is designed to balance energy removal and injection e varies in time and space and the balance is neither local nor instantaneous the scheme may potentially inject more or alternatively considerably less energy than is globally removed at a particular instance of time furthermore the inclusion of backscatter increases the spatially and temporally varying viscosity coefficient as well as it energizes the flow which the viscosity scheme tries to counteract compare amplitudes in fig 5a with those in fig 5b f therefore a new balance between viscosity and backscatter is created which varies in both components and for both time and space this balance can potentially either lean toward too much dissipation or too much backscatter for the leith scheme the latter is the case the backscatter is only directly controlling the injection of ke into the flow but not the conversion of potential to kinetic energy as the flow is fed by a temperature relaxation at the boundaries eq 2 an excessively turbulent flow may modify eddy heat fluxes from an effectively infinite heat reservoir at the walls increasing the release of potential energy in the leith backscatter setup the standard deviations in w and temperature are much larger than in the 1 12 reference not shown this might be a result of the spatially strongly varying leith viscosity which also imprints onto the backscatter as a result the reynolds scheme is chosen as the default backscatter scheme 3 2 3 backscatter parameter r dis backscatter amplitude changing r dis has only minor effects on the total ke of the simulation fig 4b low values of r dis correspond to a reduced backscatter amplitude and show some effect by reducing total ke fig 4b although sensitivity to this parameter is considerably smaller than what is reported by klöwer et al 2018 one of the reasons is that our setup does not have a pronounced turbulent boundary layer as can be found near complex bottom topography coast lines or in the case of western boundary currents we expect that this parameter will have more impact once we test the backscatter in global ocean simulations aside from the surface ke another indicator for the effect of this parameter is the balance of backscatter vs viscosity energy tendencies fig 5d f decreasing this parameter leads to a balance that is more dissipative i e favors the viscosity energy tendencies increasing this parameter leads to a balance that injects more energy the equilibrium levels of viscous and backscatter energy tendencies change with lower values of r dis injecting less energy and consequently leading to reduced total viscous dissipation as the flow is slightly less turbulent fig 5e 3 2 4 backscatter parameter c0 temporal smoothing the temporal uke smoothing controls the timescale of the energy release from the uke reservoir and is governed by c 0 it shows an impact on ke only when the parameter is reduced substantially i e when temporal smoothing is high fig 4c however it has a considerable impact on the uke equation not shown as it can prevent the occurrence of negative uke values when c 0 is decreased we found a good balance between a smooth mostly positive uke and high values of total ke with a parameter choice of 0 1 which is smaller than reported by jansen et al 2015 probably due to the fact that our implementation needs a stronger spatial and temporal smoothing for the uke equation 3 2 5 backscatter parameters n 1 n 2 n 3 spatial smoothing spatial smoothing is applied to each of the following three terms i the dissipated energy term which forces the uke equation ii the backscattered energy term which dissipates energy in the uke equation and iii the actual backscatter tendency contribution to the velocity field u the filter settings are described by a triple of integers n 1 n 2 n 3 which specify the number of iterated filter cycles in i ii and iii respectively spatial smoothing does not affect the total surface ke much fig 4e it is however crucial for model stability and the prevention of negative uke also the backscatter tendency in the momentum equation needs sufficient smoothing to reinject energy at scales larger than the dominant scales of viscous dissipation especially higher resolution setups are sensitive to the number of smoothing cycles not shown we found that n 1 n 2 n 3 2 2 4 is a good choice with regard to model stability and smallest amount of total energy dissipation for all tested resolutions this suggests a sufficient scale separation of the backscatter and viscosity operators even for high wavenumber resolving simulations where the backscatter is small 3 2 6 sign definite vs sign indefinite formulation we analyzed the effect of the sign indefinite v compared to the sign definite v formulation of the energy tendency operators in the uke equation fig 4f the sign definite formulation remains numerically stable and is more energetic than the reference simulation without backscatter ref 1 4 it also does not need as many spatial smoothing cycles or potentially as low a value for c 0 to keep the model numerically stable compared to the sign indefinite version furthermore the leith sign definite version performs just as well as the reynolds sign definite version without the excessive injection of energy seen for the sign indefinite leith backscatter scheme this points to the flux components of the viscous dissipation rate v i e the first term on the right of eq 7 as the main cause of excessive energy injection for the sign indefinite leith scheme however all sign definite versions are clearly outperformed by the sign indefinite reynolds scheme in terms of improved surface ke this observation indicates that the flux components in eq 7 are relevant and necessary contributions for a good performance of the backscatter scheme in this setup 3 2 7 decision on the default scheme based on the sensitivity studies we choose the following default scheme viscosity is implemented by the biharmonic reynolds scheme the energy source and sink terms to the uke equation are chosen in their sign indefinite form with parameter r dis 1 the temporal smoothing parameter is taken to be c 0 0 1 and the number of filtering cycles is 2 2 4 for smoothing the source term in the uke model the sink term in the uke model and the backscatter forcing in the momentum equation respectively the two default backscatter setups for the two lower resolutions are back 1 4 and back 1 6 see table 1 both setups reach similar levels of surface ke as the reference ref 1 12 fig 4d 3 3 impact of the default backscatter scheme 3 3 1 simulated flow hereafter we give a detailed assessment of the flow which is simulated with the default backscatter setup total ke in the lower resolution runs with backscatter is restored to a level comparable to the level at much higher eddy resolving resolution we note that backscatter actually increases the rate of viscous dissipation however this loss is balanced by the backscatter energy injection fig 5b and d up to a level where the balance between the two is closer to total ke conservation than the rate of viscous energy loss in the high resolution 1 12 reference compare to fig 5a the improved energy balance is also visible in the total ke of the default scheme at 1 4 resolution at different model layer depths fig 6a b and c ke is increased by about 50 in all layers to a level comparable to ref 1 12 in the surface layer energy spectra backscatter leads to an increased energy across the entire spectrum near the northern and southern boundaries and in the center of the channel both for the 1 4 and 1 6 simulations not shown however the increase in spectral power through backscatter does not necessarily rectify the structure of the mean flow at lower resolution to the structure observed in ref 1 12 the lower resolution runs without backscatter ref 1 4 and ref 1 6 have a bimodal zonal mean flow but ref 1 12 is unimodal even though the bimodal structure collapses to a unimodal one in back 1 4 the location and width of the mean flow peak is not quite the same as in ref 1 12 fig 2a and b in back 1 6 the flow stays bimodal although the jets are getting closer fig 2d and e as a consequence line spectra at different locations do not always match the high resolution reference not shown total mean ke and eke in the different layers on the other hand are similar between the backscatter simulations and the high resolution reference figs 2 and 4d the question to which degree backscatter schemes are capable of rectifying the spatial structure and strength of the mean flow will need to be addressed in follow up studies aside from ke and eke backscatter also considerably improves other layer mean quantities such as the standard deviation of w and of t fig 3 while the improvement is not quite strong enough to totally alleviate errors in these fields in back 1 4 the results in back 1 6 show a remarkably good match with ref 1 12 this is especially noteworthy since the backscatter scheme injects ke only into the horizontal momentum equation eq 4 it does not directly affect the variability of t or w nonetheless the improved representation of eddies in the system leads to a corresponding improvement in the variability of other fields as well on the other hand the horizontal mean flow biases which are still present in the backscatter simulations are also visible in these other flow variables as they are affected by the position of the mean current not shown however many flow properties can be represented on a 1 4 mesh with backscatter nearly as well as on a 1 12 mesh without backscatter the additional computational costs for backscatter are around 50 in this setup with only one tracer equation and including all the high frequency output this is a very small amount of additional costs compared to those resulting from a resolution increase from 1 4 to 1 12 the 1 12 is at least 30 times more expensive in theory and is often even more expensive in practice 3 3 2 unresolved kinetic energy details the uke of the backscatter scheme nicely scales with resolution as expected fig 7b although the general horizontal structure of the subgrid energy is quite similar between the resolutions the difference between the northern and southern part of the domain is more pronounced in back 1 4 than in back 1 6 this might be one of the reasons why in back 1 4 the mean flow representation looks better than in back 1 6 another noteworthy aspect is that uke drops to about one third its maximum value from surface to bottom fig 7a justifying the use of a vertically variable uke as designed the backscatter parametrization tends to act on larger scales than the viscosity parametrization compare fig 7h and fig 7i the smoothing of the two energy tendency contributions to the uke equation fig 7e and f ensures that the uke field is sufficiently smooth and mostly positive at each timestep fig 7d and positive when layer averaged fig 7a both contributions are large at similar locations following the flow structure but smoothed in time and space the energy contribution from the backscatter term eq 13 to the momentum equation has a very similar form as the sink term in the uke equation eq 11b with the exception of being spatially slightly more distinct in structure compare fig 7f to 7g the actual energy injection by the backscatter has a very similar unimodal structure at the surface compared to the surface total ke and eke of ref 1 12 fig 7c only the peak of the energy injection is slightly more northward around 40 n 41 n compared to the reference simulation ke peak around 38 n and the eke peak around 38 n 40 n the zonally averaged backscatter energy tendency of the momentum equation also looks much smoother in space than the actual uke compare fig 7b to 7c 4 variable grid simulations we test the effect of backscatter on a grid with zonally varying resolution the zonal extent is increased to 40 where about half of the domain is eddy permitting while the other half is eddy resolving with transition zones between the two grid resolutions fig 8 these transition zones are relatively sharp in this setup and therefore present a somewhat extreme testcase as a high resolution reference for the mixed resolution simulations we keep the equidistant grid ref 1 12 simulation with zonal extent of 20 used in the previous section 4 1 reference simulation without backscatter in the reference simulation without backscatter ref m an imprint of the local resolution is clearly visible in the daily means of all fields fig 9a b c the high resolution part of the domain is also visible in the temporal means of for example surface eke fig 10b and in the standard deviation of sea surface height fig 10c further imprints of the resolution change can also be found in the vertical structure of mean eke fig 11a and standard deviation of temperature fig 11b and w fig 11c once the flow enters the high resolution part of the domain all these fields become more intense and reach deeper down once they leave the high resolution part they return back to much smaller values for a detailed discussion of these observations see danilov and wang 2015 the mean flow shows an artifact of the resolution change visible for example in the mean ke fig 10a in the low resolution region just upstream of the high resolution part around 0 5 longitude the flow shows a wave like excursion as if confronted with an obstacle further the length of the high resolution domain in this grid configuration does not seem sufficient to saturate the vertical structure of for example eke since there is still a zonal slope in this field at the downstream end of the high resolution domain fig 11a this suggests that equilibrium amplitudes i e those corresponding to a purely high resolution simulation of this and other fields are not reached compared to ref 1 12 ref m underestimates the amplitudes of the flow fields when looking at zonal averages fig 12a b c d and the vertical structure of layer averages fig 12e f g h furthermore even though ref m does reproduce the unimodal structure of the mean flow the peak in the mean flow is slightly too far north this is caused by the northward excursion of the spurious wave pattern described above from which the flow cannot fully recover even in the high resolution domain 4 2 impact of default backscatter setup 4 2 1 simulated flow the effect of backscatter in the mixed resolution setup back m is very similar to the effect in the equidistant mesh configurations generally ke and eke are considerably increased especially in the low resolution part of the channel fig 10d and e the pattern of ke and also of t and ssh variability is much more zonally uniform for back m fig 10d e f reducing the visible imprint of the resolution change on these fields this is also true for the vertical structure of the flow i e meridionally averaged ke and eke and meridionally averaged standard deviation of t and w fig 11d e f daily means of w at 100 m depth sst and surface vorticity are also much more uniform fig 9d e f to the point where the visible imprint of the change of resolution is substantially reduced backscatter does however not reduces the wave like disturbance upstream of the high resolution subdomain fig 10a if anything it reenergizes this flow anomaly as the structure is already present in ref m the inclusion of backscatter just strengthens it rather than removing it from the flow backscatter enhanced imprints of the anomaly are also visible in the vertical flow structure for layer averaged eke and for the variability of t fig 11d and e back m is slightly more energetic in terms of total ke and slightly more variable in fields such as t ssh and w when compared to ref 1 12 see the zonal surface layer averages and the vertical structure of total layer averages in fig 12 the reason is that back m also allows for backscatter in the part of the domain which is resolved at 1 12 while ref 1 12 does not include any backscatter in general backscatter reenergizes the flow not only at the surface but at all vertical layers the typical increase of layer ke is about 30 between ref m and back m and brings the backscatter simulation close to ref 1 12 fig 12e 4 2 2 unresolved kinetic energy details backscatter is especially active in regions with low resolution hence strong dissipation fig 13d in the high resolution part of the domain backscatter is more active in the northern central part of the domain where the mean flow is strong and eddy scales are small therefore even pushing the limits of an eddy resolving simulation at 1 12 resolution fig 13d the same pattern is visible in daily mean snapshots of uke fig 13c interestingly time averaged uke actually exhibits slightly negative values near the surface in the middle of the channel in the high resolution part of the domain dark blue areas in fig 13a and b while backscatter is sometimes active to energize the flow in this region fig 13c and d there are substantial periods where the backscatter scheme is switched off due to local depletion of uke the 1 12 resolution is already so high that backscatter is inactive more often than not backscatter is also active in the high resolution part of the domain because a the mean flow transports under resolved eddies from the low resolution part into the high resolution part and b the mean flow distortion is rectified when the flow enters the high resolution region the vertical uke structure shows a slight increase of uke when moving from mid depth of about 1000 m further down toward the bottom as discussed above the flow reaches higher energy levels and flow variability once it enters the high resolution region even though it does not saturate before it returns to the low resolution region for mean eke this is especially pronounced at depth see fig 11a for ref m this in turn affects local dissipation consequently uke is affected in back m as well such visible variations in uke with depth highlight the necessity to maintain a three dimensional uke field to capture the varying dissipation rates between vertical layers 5 discussion and outlook we developed an energy backscatter parametrization based on previous studies by jansen et al 2015 and klöwer et al 2018 the parametrization is energetically more consistent and less dissipative than classical eddy viscosity parametrizations at the same time it maintains sufficient dissipation of enstrophy to preserve numerical stability our sensitivity studies showed that energy backscatter is able to balance the viscosity energy tendencies and that it reinjects the right amount of energy back into the flow on larger scales without violating model stability the nonlinear upscale energy transfer of the resolved flow then distributes the reinjected energy in a physically realistic way an important aspect both for the theoretical design of backscatter and for the observed numerical stability of the scheme is the necessity of temporal and spatial smoothing temporal smoothing simulates the delay of uke release back into the mean flow spatial smoothing is necessary to release the energy on larger scales than where it is dissipated certainly the existence of a grid mode in our finite volume discretization adds to the amount of smoothing cycles that are needed to keep the model numerically stable and the unresolved energy smooth and mostly positive in the reentrant channel setup of this study the low resolution simulations without backscatter were far too dissipative thus deficient in the level of total kinetic energy and in the level of flow variability when compared to an eddy resolving 1 12 simulation without backscatter the 1 4 simulation had only about 60 70 of the reference kinetic energy the 1 6 simulation had an energy defect of around 20 with backscatter these energy deficits are entirely rectified moreover the variability of for example temperature and of vertical velocity improved to the point where they are nearly indistinguishable from the reference while characteristics of the mean flow are also improved the backscatter parametrization cannot entirely rectify a mean flow bias the next more challenging step following this idealized channel setup will be the implementation of backscatter in a global ocean configuration we expect that some adjustments will be necessary first the current test case has no complex bottom topography along complex ocean floor structures physical dissipation is a relevant ke sink so that backscatter would need to be reduced or switched off entirely to prevent reinjection of the dissipated energy backscatter might also lead to numerical instabilities if it is too strong similar considerations apply to complex boundaries e g along to the western flanks of the strong western boundary currents the parameter r dis might take care of such backscatter damping in a physically consistent way as reported by klöwer et al 2018 but it might become necessary to adapt r dis to the basin geometry or to otherwise redesign the part of the parametrization that defines how much dissipated energy is actually entering the uke regime and is available for backscatter second changes in resolution on unstructured grids might still become a problem although we showed that the scheme works well for rapidly changing grid resolution a more complex structure of the transition zones might still lead to issues that are not covered by our current study while uke should scale with resolution issues might still arise for very high resolution parts of a global mesh configuration where backscatter is no longer desired at all future studies will have to address issues regarding model stability brought about by the coupling with the uke equation while the highly spatially and temporally varying viscosity coefficient employed in this study might be a better subgrid eddy closure than the one varying only according to the grid resolution which has previously been applied in the context of kinetic energy backscatter it also is more difficult to combine with the backscatter scheme this is evidenced by the overenergizing of the mean flow when combining backscatter with the harmonic leith and biharmonic background viscosity adding vertical layers to the uke field requires extra effort but was found necessary for reasons of stability and model performance furthermore there is a strong interplay between the details of the numerical scheme and the details of the backscatter closure different schemes will raise additional questions that need to be solved more or less individually smoothing in this context is a powerful tool to distinguish between the large scale flow and eddy and backscatter scales as also discussed by berloff 2018 one aspect that is certainly worth further investigation is the question with what kind of spatial structure the energy should be backscattered while we need to have a scale separation between dissipation and backscatter it is not clear what the exact structure of the respective operators or the related smoothing should be it seems sensible that energy should be backscattered close to where it is dissipated unless uke advection is significant which is currently not clear generally energy should mostly be injected where the model is dynamically active or should be active compared to higher resolutions the latter is not necessarily predictable alternative approaches to ocean backscatter also include stochastic implementations cooper 2017 cooper and zanna 2015 jansen and held 2014 mana and zanna 2014 where the unresolved eddy effects are simulated by stochastic patterns a combination of a stochastic and the here presented deterministic approach are feasible where the deterministic part tracks the backscatter amplitude and approximate location while the stochastic patterns distribute the energy locally in a random fashion furthermore certain parameters as part of the backscatter scheme are related to high uncertainties that could be tackled by stochastic components following implementations by for example juricke et al 2017 2018 an example in this context would be the parameter r dis which when chosen in a specific regime does not seem to affect model stability very much but would affect the total amount of backscattered energy additionally it is of interest to study how backscatter affects higher order eddy statistics such as eddy size and life time these properties are not directly included in the backscatter scheme but are certainly affected by the backscatter forcing of the flow furthermore the impact of backscatter on the mean flow deserves much closer attention finally there are other aspects of the energy cycle that are not addressed by our backscatter parametrization one example is numerical energy dissipation through time stepping and horizontal discretization this loss of kinetic energy is not captured by the uke equation other examples are the generally underestimated growth rates of baroclinic instabilities barham et al 2018 and the conversion of potential to kinetic energy which are also affected by the resolution and the capability of the model to fully resolve mesoscale and even submesoscale structures with backscatter the conversion might be improved by increased eke but we will have to investigate the full energy cycle including potential energy conversion in future studies with more realistic forcing the current results suggest that there is potential for savings in terms of computing cost of more than one order of magnitude without degrading the level of mean kinetic and eddy kinetic energy on a lower resolution grid acknowledgments this paper is a contribution to the projects m3 and s2 of the

computational resources were supplied by the supercomputing facilities at the alfred wegener institute in bremerhaven appendix a leith viscosity scheme an alternative to the biharmonic reynolds viscosity with coefficient following eq 5 relies on the leith and modified leith viscosities fox kemper and menemenlis 2008 a 1 ν c l 0 0 2 min s c s c c d u c 2 c l q c 2 ν 0 s c s r s c δ t with the minimum function serving to taper the viscosity to ensure that the cfl condition is not violated here q k u denotes the vertical vorticity and c d c l are constants on the order of one the term ν 0 s c s r provides a resolution scaled minimum viscosity where ν 0 is the constant minimum viscosity coefficient and s r 5 8 109 m2 as before the leith viscosity can be associated with the scaling laws for 2d turbulence in the enstrophy range fox kemper and menemenlis 2008 since it is already scale selective it is used with the harmonic operator a recent study by pearson et al 2017 shows that this form of viscosity generally leads to smaller total dissipation than the biharmonic one with quasi uniform coefficient however it is nonuniform in space and may be insufficient to damp a grid mode where ν c l0 is small it is therefore run in combination with small background biharmonic viscosity with coefficient a 2 ν c bb max 0 u 0 bb s c 1 2 ν c l 0 where u 0 bb 0 01 ms 1 so that the background viscosity is active only when the harmonic leith viscosity is small the numerical factors in the formulas above are obtained experimentally as to prevent buildup of grid scale noise in the vertical velocity field they differ from those in pearson et al 2017 because of the differences in mesh geometry and discretization the leith viscosity coefficient is rather patchy in our simulations and is smoothed with a spatial filter f defined in eq c 3 so that ν c l f 2 c c ν c l 0 here f 2 denotes the composition of f with itself and einstein summation over the repeated index c running over neighbors of c is implied appendix b approximate viscosity operators b 1 approximate harmonic viscosity operator to compute the viscous force in the discrete case one needs to estimate the components of the stress tensor σ at the edges of the triangular cell the components can be easily computed either at cell centroids or at vertices and then averaged to edges as it turns out the resulting divergence of σ on the triangle c involves the velocities at neighboring triangles i e those sharing the same edges only with small weights which reduce to zero on equilateral meshes as a consequence the difference between the velocities on triangle c and neighboring triangles c only weakly contributes to the viscous force it will therefore fail to damp a grid mode for a discussion on spurious modes on triangular grids see e g roux 2012 for this reason we define an approximate viscous operator v which acts dissipatively on the grid mode via b 1 v u c 1 s c c n c u c u c ℓ c c r c c ν c ν c 2 where n c is the set of triangles having a common edge with c ℓ c c is the length of the edge between cells c and c r c c is the vector pointing from the centroid of cell c to the centroid of cell c and s c as before when the mesh cells are equilateral triangles u c u c r c c is the velocity gradient in the direction of the outward normal to the edge between c and c so that the right of eq b 1 is the sum of viscous fluxes leaving cell c thus defining a consistent discretization of the harmonic viscosity operator v u ν u although this interpretation is only approximate on general meshes we use the formula above as a substitute for the harmonic viscosity operator see also the discussion of different viscosity operator options for fesom2 in danilov et al 2017 since the geometric quantities in eq b 1 and the mean viscosity are defined on edges they can be incorporated into a generalized edge viscosity ν c c which is symmetric between c and c so that eq b 1 takes the form b 2 v u c 1 s c c n c u c u c ν c c summing over all cells c c s c v u c 0 because the difference between u c and u c appears with opposite signs in the expressions for cell c and c hence momentum is globally preserved furthermore taking the total viscous dissipation c s c v c s c u c v u c we observe that the contribution from c and c appears twice one time as ν cc u c u c u c and the other time as ν c c u c u c u c which sum to ν c c u c u c 2 note that this rearrangement is equivalent to operations in eq 7 with the flux contribution disappearing because of the area sum this proves that area mean kinetic energy dissipation is non positive and introduces a discrete equivalent of the sign definite dissipation rate v see eq 7 namely b 3 v c c ν c c s c c u c u c 2 which is associated with the area s c c s c s c 3 around the edge c c it is conservatively remapped to a cell dissipation rate b 4 v c 1 3 c n c v c c if layer thicknesses vary the coefficients must vary with volume rather than area b 2 approximate biharmonic viscosity operator a discrete biharmonic viscosity operator is obtained by applying an expression of the form of eq b 1 twice to avoid splitting the viscosity coefficient between the two harmonic operators we define b 5 l u c c n c u c u c which we can represent by a symmetric matrix l c c where l c c 1 if c c have a common edge and zero otherwise and l cc c n c l c c then l u c l c c u c where summation over repeated indices is implied we further define an operator n whose matrix representation is diagonal with n cc ν c b then the discrete biharmonic operator defined via b 6 v b u c 1 s c lnl u c 1 s c l cn n nm l mj u j is symmetric and negative as can be shown by taking the dot product with u c and summing over all cells as for the case of harmonic viscosity this suggests a sign definite expression for the energy dissipation rate defined on cells b 7 v c b ν c b s c l u c 2 it is convenient to specify the coefficient of biharmonic viscosity in terms of its harmonic equivalent by setting ν c b s c ν c no summation implied which is assumed in our implementation appendix c smoothing filter as discussed in the main text we require smoothing filters in several places of our implementation of backscatter to smooth the leith coefficient of viscosity to smooth the diagnosed dissipation rate v and most importantly to ensure that the energy returned back to the flow is free of small scales our filters are powers of a single filtering operator the composition of averaging from cell centroids to common vertices denoted x with averaging from vertices back to centroids denoted c let a c be any quantity defined at cells its vertex values a v are obtained as c 1 a v x a v c c v a c s c c c v s c where c v denotes the set of cells containing vertex v letting x vc denote the associated matrix symbol we can also write a v x vc a c similarly for a quantity b v defined on vertices we define its cell values b c via c 2 b c c b c 1 3 v v c b v where v c is the set of vertices of cell c finally we set c 3 f cx the effective spatial smoothing length of eq c 3 varies with grid resolution however the filter can be applied several times to increase the smoothing length for example the leith viscosity is filtered twice which can be written as f 2 
24033,we present a new energy backscatter parametrization for primitive equation ocean models at eddy permitting resolution specifically for unstructured grids traditional eddy parametrizations in terms of viscosity closures lead to excessive dissipation of kinetic energy when used with eddy permitting meshes implemented into the fesom2 ocean model the backscatter parametrization leads to a more realistic total dissipation of kinetic energy it maintains a reservoir of dissipated energy and reinjects this subgrid energy at larger scales at a controlled rate the separation between dissipation and backscatter scales is achieved by using different order differential operators and or spatial smoothing this ensures numerical model stability we perform sensitivity studies with different choices of parameter settings and viscosity schemes in a configuration with a baroclinically unstable flow in a zonally reentrant channel with a horizontally uniform mesh the best backscatter setup substantially improves eddy permitting simulations at 1 4 and 1 6 resolution bringing them close to a 1 12 eddy resolving reference improvements are largest for levels of kinetic energy and variability in temperature and vertical velocity a selected optimal default scheme is then tested in a mixed resolution setup a channel with narrow transitions between an eddy permitting and an eddy resolving subdomain the backscatter scheme is able to adapt dynamically to the different resolutions and moves the diagnostics closer to the high resolution reference throughout the domain our study is a first step toward using backscatter in global variable mesh ocean models and suggests potential for substantial improvements of ocean mean state and variability at reduced computational cost keywords kinetic energy backscatter subgrid eddy parametrization inverse energy cascade viscosity closure eddy permitting resolution 1 introduction mesoscale eddies contribute to the transport of heat and tracers in many regions of the ocean e g griffies et al 2015 jayne and marotzke 2002 they affect the shape and temporal behavior of the ocean currents e g kirtman et al 2012 and modify the atmosphere ocean exchange e g bryan et al 2010 frenger et al 2016 roberts et al 2016 they further play a crucial role in the response to changes in atmospheric forcing in a warming climate and can for example counteract the effect of increasing westerlies on the southern ocean circumpolar current munday et al 2013 the resolution of any ocean or atmosphere model defines to a large degree which processes can be explicitly resolved and which need to be parametrized i e represented through theoretical or heuristic equations that describe the mean impact of unresolved subgrid processes on the resolved mean flow the traditional approach to simulating subgrid mesoscale turbulence is via the gent mcwilliams parametrization gent and mcwilliams 1990 in the tracer equations and an eddy viscosity closure in the momentum equation when mesoscale eddies are resolved only the latter is used it simulates the effects of baroclinic instability due to subgrid structures and maintains model stability by dissipating enstrophy at the grid scale danilov et al 2019 however if resolution is insufficient horizontal viscosity closures while dissipating enstrophy at small scales are also excessively dissipating energy they are thereby degrading the effective resolution of the ocean model even further by damping eddy structures and reducing mean and eddy kinetic energy at 1 resolution still in use today in many climate models taylor et al 2012 the gent mcwilliams parametrization is widely used to simulate the mean impact of unresolved eddies on potential energy release present day global ocean models used for climate research generally move toward an ocean grid resolution of 1 4 haarsma et al 2016 which is eddy permitting over broad ocean domains such models start to resolve mesoscale turbulence the size of mesoscale eddies however depends on the first internal rossby radius which varies from a few kilometers on shelves in the high latitudes to around 100 km at around 10 n 10 s hallberg 2013 sein et al 2017 according to hallberg 2013 the local rossby radius should be resolved with at least two mesh points to represent eddies and even finer resolution may be needed to reduce over dissipation on scales where physical instabilities occur soufflet et al 2016 thus only the largest eddies are fully resolved on 1 4 meshes and most of the mesoscale eddy activity remains part of the unresolved subgrid an eddy permitting model is able to represent some of the inverse energy cascade whereby energy is transferred from smaller to larger scales a process predicted in theory danilov et al 2019 and observed in the ocean e g scott and wang 2005 wang et al 2015 although the arguments for the underlying physical mechanisms driving an inverse cascade may vary depending on the analyzed flow regime its existence has been observed in many studies see e g wang et al 2015 and references therein the challenge of eddy permitting meshes comes from combining resolved eddies in low latitudes with unresolved i e parametrized eddies in high latitudes through wide areas where eddies could be simulated but suffer from excessive damping by the viscosity closure in the real ocean mesoscale eddy kinetic energy is removed from the system by many processes such as bottom friction and dissipation in the mixed layer with the horizontal viscosity contribution being small to improve eddy permitting ocean models the ideal concept is to keep the level and distribution of kinetic energy dissipation close to what is observed in the real ocean where horizontal viscous energy dissipation is much smaller than in the models conceptually this means that energy dissipated due to horizontal viscosity needs to be reintroduced into the system without violating model stability one of the main constraints for any numerical simulation as the inverse energy cascade is at least partly resolved at eddy permitting resolution this gives an opportunity to inject energy back into the system at scales larger than those of dissipation and make use of this inverse energy cascade in the sense of energy backscatter i e energy transferred from smaller back to larger scales energizing the entire spectrum of wavenumbers the concept of energy backscatter parametrizations has a long history danilov et al 2019 frederiksen and davies 1997 jansen and held 2014 jansen et al 2015 kitsios et al 2013 predominantly in the context of idealized setups energy backscatter parametrizations have also been used in the atmospheric sciences and in global atmospheric models berner et al 2009 leutbecher et al 2017 shutts 2005 in this context backscatter parametrizations are to a large degree used as a tool for estimating the uncertainty due to the lack of information about the unresolved scales in particular stochastic backscatter can be used to inflate the dynamical growth of model ensemble spread shutts 2005 recently in the context of increased ocean model resolution the idea of backscatter as an energetically consistent closure has gathered new momentum and generated promising results in idealized ocean model simulations jansen et al 2015 klöwer et al 2018 the approaches in these studies are making efficient use of the special situation of model resolution we currently encounter in ocean models energy backscatter can be employed to reinject energy and improve both the mean and variability of connected model quantities the next step is to investigate the impact of ocean kinetic energy backscatter in full primitive equation global ocean models a wide variety of ocean models are currently used in coupled climate models applying different parametrizations discretizations resolutions and dynamical cores the finite element sea ice ocean model fesom danilov et al 2004 wang et al 2014 was the first multiresolution global ocean model coupled to an atmospheric component in a climate model setup rackow et al 2018 sidorenko et al 2015 it allows to locally vary grid resolutions by designing telescoped i e locally increased resolution triangular meshes the advantage is that mesh refinement can be made where it is necessary for example to locally resolve the mesoscale eddy field sein et al 2016 sein et al 2017 fesom has moved to a finite volume dynamical core in fesom2 in variable grid simulations the effect of a coarse domain region upstream or nearby may still be visible in the high resolution areas see danilov and wang 2015 sein et al 2016 backscatter parametrizations may be used to partly compensate for these effects making fesom and fesom2 an ideal testbed to implement study and improve backscatter parametrizations not only on classical equidistant grids but also on more challenging grids with varying resolution on such grids backscatter is expected to be most active in the low resolution parts helping to energize the flow there and consequently also in the downstream higher resolution regions in this paper we provide a systematic evaluation of different backscatter implementations in the context of fesom2 in a 3d zonally reentrant channel setup our backscatter model as in jansen et al 2015 applies an unresolved kinetic energy uke equation to the scalar uke field which keeps track of the energy dissipated by the viscous operator making it available for reinjection into the momentum equation different from jansen et al 2015 we use a three dimensional rather than vertically averaged two dimensional uke field we test the backscatter setup on horizontally uniform and variable meshes and for different viscosity parametrizations with temporally and spatially varying viscosity coefficients we compare the eddy permitting simulations with and without backscatter with a high resolution eddy resolving reference to investigate the impact of the backscatter on mean and eddy kinetic energy but also on flow variability in quantities such as temperature and vertical velocity the paper is structured as follows in section 2 we introduce the model and the experimental setup we also introduce the viscosity parametrization options and present the new backscatter parametrizations including relevant parameters section 3 discusses simulations with backscatter on two uniform grids of 1 4 and 1 6 resolution and compares them to an eddy resolving reference of 1 12 resolution we further explore the sensitivity of the backscatter parametrization to different parameter settings and identify an optimal default scheme in section 4 we test the default scheme in a mixed resolution setup we compare simulations with and without backscatter focusing on the transitions between high and low resolution mesh domains section 5 discusses the results and their potential with regard to global ocean simulations 2 model and backscatter parametrization 2 1 model setup the model used for this study is the current version of fesom2 danilov et al 2017 it solves the primitive equations using triangular surface meshes and a cell vertex quasi b grid discretization with tracers sea surface height and vertical velocities on mesh vertices and horizontal velocities on triangle centroids details to the model setup temporal discretization and the advection schemes can be found in danilov et al 2017 here we use a simplified setup that does not include the sea ice model and uses a linear equation of state with temperature being the only advected scalar field the classical ocean momentum equation is given by 1 t u u u w z u f u 1 ρ 0 p v u z a v z u with u u v the horizontal velocity field w the vertical velocity time t vertical coordinate z x y the horizontal gradient operator coriolis parameter f u v u reference water density ρ 0 pressure p vertical viscosity coefficient a v which is specified by the vertical mixing parametrization in fesom2 and horizontal subgrid viscosity parametrization v to be discussed further we use the usual quadratic frictional stress term as the bottom boundary condition where a v z u c d u u with c d 0 001 no wind stress is applied at the surface with regard to viscous stresses at vertical walls free slip boundary conditions were applied impermeability at the boundaries is always implied furthermore for the biharmonic operator there is one more boundary condition we set to zero contributions from boundary edges in eq b 6 which is equivalent to the assumption that the velocity derivative in the direction of the boundary u n is zero the flow is maintained by temperature relaxation near the boundaries via the temperature equation 2 t t u t z w t z k v z t γ t clim t the density ρ is given by the linear equation of state 3 ρ ρ 0 1 α t t 0 here t denotes the temperature t 0 its reference value k v the vertical diffusivity provided by the vertical mixing parametrization t clim the given climatological temperature distribution γ the relaxation parameter different from zero only in narrow zones see section 2 3 and α is the thermal expansion coefficient in the linear equation of state horizontal diffusivity is provided by the transport scheme which combines 3rd order upwind with weight 0 25 and 4th order centered with weight 0 75 fluxes heat fluxes through all surfaces are assumed to be zero the setup of the numerical experiments will be explained further in section 2 3 together with the selection of γ and t clim 2 2 backscatter scheme the focus of this study is the subgrid closure for the momentum equation of the ocean model eq 1 is augmented to include a negative viscosity term that acts as kinetic energy backscatter the new momentum equation reads 4 t u u u w z u f u 1 ρ 0 p v u b u z a v z u with b u as the backscatter term it should be emphasized here that the backscatter term b u is not designed to represent the physical inverse energy transfer from unresolved to resolved scales in the sense of an inverse cascade near the model grid s truncation scale instead it is a numerically stable method to compensate for the unphysical forward energy transfer caused by the viscous closure v u this is achieved by reinjecting excessively dissipated kinetic energy on larger scales and making use of the already resolved inverse energy cascade to allow the resolved flow dynamics to simulate well developed mesoscale turbulence see also the discussion in jansen et al 2015 in the following we will discuss the design of both the viscosity term v u and the backscatter term b u 2 2 1 viscosity parametrization v u on triangular meshes triangles with a common edge differ in the orientation relative to one another for example on regular triangular grids one can imagine that a central triangle is pointing northwards with one of its tips while all three neighboring triangles are pointing southwards with one of their tips the neighboring triangles are effectively rotated by 180 relative to the central triangle this may lead to a grid mode grid imprinting for discrete quantities located on triangles see also danilov et al 2017 since the horizontal velocities of fesom2 are defined as volume averages over triangular prisms they may suffer from such a mode in order to keep it under control a special form of viscous dissipation operator is needed capable of dissipating a grid pattern in velocity fesom2 is therefore run with approximate harmonic and biharmonic operators detailed in appendix b which act strongly dissipatively on the grid mode and are thus capable of effectively suppressing it for simulations of turbulent flows we seek such a viscous operator that would provide minimum dissipation consistent with numerical stability in this study we test two different viscosity schemes in the following we will only discuss the reynolds type viscosity scheme that showed the best results as discussed in section 3 the alternative leith viscosity parametrization is detailed in appendix a the reynolds type viscosity uses the discrete biharmonic operator given by eq b 6 with a coefficient for each grid cell c 5 ν c b s c ν c r with ν c r max u 0 r u c s c 30 here s c is the area of the top of the prism c u 0 r 0 2 m s is a velocity scale selected experimentally as well as the factor 1 30 and u c is the cell horizontal velocity for large velocities this form of dissipation is similar to that of the third order upwind scheme but with a reduced coefficient we note that ν c r has the dimension of a harmonic viscosity it keeps the cell reynolds number constant throughout the simulation hence the superscript r 2 2 2 energetic considerations of v u to know how much uke is available for reinjection into the resolved flow we need to know how much energy has been dissipated by the viscous operator the energy dissipation rate due to horizontal viscosity at a given location in space x and time t in the continuum is given by 6 v u v u this expression is not sign definite and it only leads to consistent energy dissipation when averaged over the entire domain the subgrid viscous force v is the divergence of the subgrid viscous stress tensor σ i e v σ in the case of the classical harmonic viscosity σ 2 ν ε tr ε with ε 1 2 u u t so that the local rate of energy dissipation v takes the form 7 v u σ σu 2 ν ε tr ε 2 σu v where v is nonpositive a similar relation holds for the biharmonic viscosity v and v will become equal if averaged over some area such that the flux contribution σu becomes small both forms of the dissipation rate i e the full form v or the nonpositive form v can be used in calculations of uke available for backscatter and their discrete analogs are given in appendix b the advantage of the original form v is that it contains the full viscous energy contribution however it contains grid scale flux contributions and has to be smoothed before it is applied to computations of uke spatial smoothing is done by applying the filters defined in appendix c because of the properties of the discretization and the selection of viscous operators dissipation related to mesoscale turbulence is accompanied by dissipation of the grid mode of the cell vertex discretization this is common for staggered discretizations on unstructured meshes and may lead to increased dissipation on the grid scale 2 2 3 backscatter parametrization b u conceptually the term b u in eq 4 reinjects the energy that is excessively dissipated by the viscous parametrization but on a larger spatial scale and at a controlled rate over time in fully developed quasi geostrophic turbulence viscosity is thought to dissipate enstrophy near the truncation scale while energy dissipation is small hence by reinjecting energy at larger scales we shift the dynamics toward such a well developed turbulent state in this new equilibrium excessive energy dissipation is substantially reduced the system still dissipates a sufficient amount of enstrophy to prevent model instabilities our backscatter operator takes the form of the approximate harmonic operator given by eq b 2 except that its coefficient has the opposite sign to the coefficient of a viscosity parametrization and that its magnitude is related to the amount of available uke in our model the scalar uke field e e x z t defined on cells c follows the prognostic equation 8 t e c dis e dis e back ν c e the first term on the right c dis e dis is the resolved kinetic energy dissipation rate the second describes the rate at which uke is returned back to the resolved flow through backscatter and the last is some uke harmonic diffusion with coefficient ν c c s c s r 1 2 600 m 2 s at a specific cell c which follows jansen et al 2015 but is scaled due to changes in grid resolution with s r 5 8 109 m2 the area of a reference triangle since we apply smoothing to the first two terms additional uke diffusion is small and will not be discussed in detail note that our uke field varies in z as well in contrast to jansen et al 2015 who applied vertical averaging to the uke contributions the same is true for the spatially varying viscosity coefficient used in this study in our setup this choice is physically more realistic as the observed rates of dissipation and backscatter are about 1 3 smaller in the bottom layer than at the surface see section 3 3 2 below uke advection is neglected since it is not clear whether uke should simply be advected by the mean flow jansen et al 2015 have shown that even without uke advection the backscatter parametrization can achieve good results adding an advective term will increase computational costs but more importantly will affect model stability dissipation of resolved kinetic energy by the spatial and temporal discretization schemes is also neglected here and may be considered in future studies furthermore we do not dissipate uke through an additional term in eq 8 in line with jansen et al 2015 adding such a dissipative term could be seen as an alternative approach which we did not follow in this study instead the fact that some energy dissipates is modeled by the coefficient c dis which takes values between 0 and 1 and determines which fraction of the energy that is removed from the resolved flow enters the uke budget the coefficient c dis varies in time and space and follows the design by klöwer et al 2018 where 9 c dis u 1 r u r dis 1 with r u d r u f the local rossby number calculated for each cell by a discrete estimate of the local horizontal deformation rate 10 d r u x u y v 2 y u x v 2 where x and y are local zonal and meridional directions and u u v r dis is a tunable scaling parameter that defines for which flow regime distinguished by the local rossby number dissipated energy will enter the uke large values i e values greater than one correspond to a more effective recycling of dissipated kinetic energy see klöwer et al 2018 for a detailed discussion the first two terms in eq 8 can be calculated in two different ways the first is to use the respective tendency contributions from viscosity and backscatter directly and take the dot product with the local value of u this yields the sign non definite form corresponding to the v form of eq 7 however for reasons of numerical stability it is desirable to keep these contributions sign definite i e to have local uke injection by the viscosity term and local uke removal by the backscatter term this is achieved by applying spatial filtering as described in appendix c v is not necessarily sign definite only its area mean is non positive likewise the local values of harmonic backscatter are not sign definite injection of energy is only achieved in an area mean sense the second alternative is to use a sign definite form i e the v form of the respective terms to ensure positivity of uke as well as numerical stability sign definite forms of their respective operators were also used by jansen et al 2015 and klöwer et al 2018 the corresponding sign definite discrete forms for our scheme are detailed in appendices b 1 and b 2 in both cases spatial filtering is used for the following reasons the viscous dissipation rate may include contributions from a grid mode cf the discussion at the end of section 2 2 1 and so does the backscatter term as it is based on the same differencing scheme we do not want grid scales to be emphasized by the backscatter and carried into the subgrid energy equation spatial filtering of the tendencies will smooth it spatial filtering can be used for scale separation see also berloff 2018 smoothing of the backscatter term and the uke will ensure that the backscatter scheme is active at different larger scales than the corresponding unfiltered viscous operator some scale separation can also be achieved by using the less scale selective harmonic operator for the backscatter and the more scale selective biharmonic operator for the viscous parametrization see jansen et al 2015 for the sign indefinite form of the energy contributions spatial filtering will reduce the relative amplitude of the flux term in eq 7 if filtering is large enough the contributions from the flux term become small making the remaining energy tendency almost sign definite hence bringing v closer to v the spatial filter applied here is the one described in eq c 3 this filter has a spatial scale that depends on the grid as it incorporates only information from neighboring grid points its advantage is a minimal halo size for exchange of information across processor boundaries which is crucial for massively parallel implementations thus the first two terms in the uke model eq 8 for cell c take the form 11a c dis e dis c f n 1 c c c dis v c with v c u v u c u v b u c for the uke source and 11b e back c f n 2 c c b c with b c u b u c u c f n 3 c c v b u c for the uke sink f n denotes n cycles of the smoothing filter eq c 3 n 1 n 2 and n 3 are the experimentally selected numbers of smoothing cycles summation over the repeated index c is implied these expressions are written out for the reynolds viscosity scheme where v b denotes the discrete biharmonic operator eq b 6 with coefficient given by eq 5 and v b denotes the discrete harmonic backscatter operator eq b 2 with the coefficient scaled by the local uke amplitude e c 12 ν c b c 0 s c max 2 e c 0 0 the constant c 0 determines how quickly the dissipated energy is reinjected into the resolved flow i e it controls the temporal response of the parametrization the maximum function ensures that the backscatter is only active when there is a local reservoir of uke physically negative values of e c correspond to a local depletion of uke and can potentially occur because both the backscatter and the viscosity operators act on different scales for the leith viscosity scheme v b in eq 11a must be replaced by the sum of the harmonic operator v eq b 2 with coefficient given by eq a 1 and the biharmonic background operator v b eq b 6 with coefficient given by eq a 2 see appendix a finally the actual discrete backscatter contribution to the momentum equation eq 4 takes the form 13 b c u f n 3 c c v b u c note that the smoothing filter applied in the computation of b c in eq 11b must also be used in the backscatter tendency contribution b c u to remove the grid mode from the operator alternatively we may replace v c and b c in eqs 11a and 11b by their sign definite alternatives eqs b 4 and b 7 we retain the smoothing filters to potentially increase the scales on which the backscatter acts the backscatter term in the momentum equation also retains its smoothing filter to prevent backscatter into the grid mode the sign definite formulation typically requires fewer smoothing cycles i e smaller values of n 1 n 2 and n 3 as a consequence of these different choices we end up with four separate backscatter implementations two with sign definite energy tendencies v and two with non definite ones v one of each for the leith and one for the reynolds viscosity schemes appendix a and section 2 2 1 respectively we will further discuss the effect of different filter cycle choices the coefficients r dis and c 0 and the choice of the backscatter implementation in section 3 2 below 2 3 experimental setup we simulate a zonally reentrant baroclinically unstable flow in a channel with walls at 30 n and 45 n and spherical geometry as for global model simulations the grid is rotated with the rotated pole over greenland located at 40 w 75 n the channel has 24 unevenly spaced vertical layers with thicknesses ranging from 10 m at the surface to 100 m for the last few layers going down to the constant depth of 1600 m the flow is analyzed in two distinct sets of experimental setups that differ in their meshes and zonal extent described below for both sets of experiments when varying the horizontal resolution the vertical resolution is kept constant to enable a better comparison of the effect of increased horizontal resolution vs the backscatter parametrization both sets of experiments use the same temperature relaxation to force the mean flow this takes place in 1 5 strips at the northern and the southern boundaries the relaxation parameter γ in eq 2 takes the value 1 3 days directly at the boundary and is linearly reduced to zero at 43 5 and 31 5 respectively the reference temperature climatology t clim to which the temperature near the boundaries is relaxed is the same as the temperature initial condition which is linear with vertical gradient of 8 10 3 k m and meridional gradient of 0 5 10 5 k m the surface temperature at the southern boundary is 25 c initial velocities are zero a small temperature perturbation the structure of which is not relevant for the discussion of the results is added to the initial state to create small instabilities that quickly grow on a mean eastward flow all runs reach a statistically steady state of kinetic energy within the first year the first set of experiments compares three equidistant meshes with resolutions of 1 4 1 6 and 1 12 corresponding to triangle areas of about 270 km2 120 km2 and 30 km2 the zonal extent of the channel is 20 the lower resolution runs were performed with and without backscatter the high resolution run is used as a reference without backscatter the rossby radius is about 25 km so that the 1 4 and 1 6 grids are eddy permitting while the 1 12 grid is eddy resolving for the 1 4 setup different viscosity and backscatter schemes were tested in short 5 year integrations the default backscatter and viscosity configurations selected after carrying out the sensitivity studies of the 1 4 setup see section 3 are extended to a total of ten years each to improve statistics which are well equilibrated over this period timestep lengths for the 1 4 1 6 and 1 12 grid configurations are 15 min 10 min and 1 min respectively these choices are relatively conservative i e small especially for the 1 12 grid configuration a moderate increase of timestep did not significantly affect the results not shown the second set of experiments has a zonal extent of 40 to accommodate subdomains of different resolution the horizontal grid is unstructured and has a high and a low resolution part with two transition regions at 7 5 and 32 5 longitude see fig 1 of danilov and wang 2015 and later in this paper fig 8 the resolution varies from 1 12 in the high resolution domain to around 1 3 in the low resolution part incorporating both eddy permitting and eddy resolving grids two simulations are carried out with and without the default backscatter parametrization discussed in section 3 for the equidistant grid the general setup of the experimental domain corresponds to setup a of danilov and wang 2015 simulation length is 10 years with the timestep set to 1 min as a high resolution reference for these simulations we use the same 1 12 equidistant mesh setup with zonal extent of 20 as in the first set of experiments further details on the parameter choices of all experimental setups of this study especially for the viscosity and backscatter parametrizations can be found in the next sections 3 and 4 and are summarized in table 1 2 4 diagnostics diagnostics are based on daily mean data if not stated otherwise which provides sufficient temporal resolution the first year of each simulation is excluded as spinup unless stated otherwise we focus on zonally averaged surface mean and temporal standard deviation fields vertical layer averaged mean and temporal standard deviation fields and total integrated fields over different vertical levels eddy kinetic energy eke is here defined as the kinetic energy ke of the velocity fluctuations after removing the temporal model mean state 3 equidistant grid simulations 3 1 reference simulations without backscatter for the reference simulations we use the discrete form of the reynolds viscosity operator eq b 2 with coefficient given by eq 5 in our experiments this choice resulted in the least amount of spurious dissipation and the least amount of grid scale noise even on high resolution unstructured grids we will discuss the effect of the leith compared to the reynolds parametrization in section 3 2 1 below the circulation at 1 12 resolution is characterized by a mean eastward flow with a mean ke peak between about 38 n and a trough at about 31 n and right at the northern boundary fig 1d where the troughs can be seen as artificially forced by the temperature boundary layer relaxation the temperature relaxation forcing is also visible as a steep gradient in zonally averaged temperature close to the southern boundary fig 1a snapshots of sea surface temperature sst sea surface height ssh surface vorticity and vertical velocity w at 100 m depth reveal that turbulence is strongest in the middle of the channel fig 1 right two columns eddy size varies from larger to smaller going northward in accordance with the increase of the coriolis parameter vertical velocity fig 1f is the most sensitive field when it comes to grid scale noise some small wave like structures are visible in w but not in the other fields increased viscosity would damp these waves but also reduce the simulated variability and provide a less competitive reference for the backscatter comparing resolutions of 1 4 1 6 and 1 12 with focus on zonal temporal mean ke and eke reveals that there is not only a strong resolution dependence of the amplitude of eke but also of its meridional location and of the feedback of eddies on the mean ke fig 2 while layer averaged ke and especially eke amplitudes generally increase with increasing resolution the resolution change also impacts the general flow structure at 1 12 the flow has only one major meridional peak seen both in mean eke and ke at 1 4 and 1 6 the flow has two distinct peaks at slightly different locations around 32 and 40 n at 1 4 resolution and around 32 34 and 40 42 n at 1 6 resolution increasing resolution from 1 4 to 1 6 spreads out the two peaks but the additional eddy forcing at 1 6 is still not strong enough to break the bimodal flow structure and create the unimodal flow seen at 1 12 in the vertical an increase in horizontal resolution from 1 4 to 1 6 and finally to 1 12 leads to an intensification of ke eke by a factor of around 1 5 2 between the coarsest and the finest resolution in all layers fig 3 similar differences are seen in the layer averaged temporal standard deviations of temperature and w fig 3 right two columns we note that ke and eke increase monotonically from bottom to surface the standard deviation of temperature has peaks near bottom and surface and a minimum at a depth of about 600 800 m the opposite is true for variations in w which are most intense at mid depth and weakest near the surface and the bottom total surface ke varies substantially between resolutions fig 3 left column fig 4a at 1 12 resolution it is about 1 5 times larger than at 1 4 and about 1 2 times larger than at 1 6 this change is accompanied by an increase of the temporal variability in the total ke vertical lines in fig 4a 3 2 impact of backscatter sensitivity studies to test the backscatter scheme several parameter choices have to be made which we will briefly discuss we study the effect of these choices in structured sensitivity studies a summary of the simulations carried out for the sensitivity studies is given in table 1 3 2 1 viscosity schemes to provide baseline benchmarks we carried out a set of simulations without backscatter but with different viscosity schemes and different resolutions the biharmonic reynolds viscosity scheme is taken as described in section 2 2 1 the harmonic leith scheme with additional biharmonic background viscosity see appendix a has a tunable coefficient of minimum viscosity ν 0 we tested different values at 1 4 resolution the reynolds viscosity scheme shows the least depletion of total ke the two leith viscosity settings with minimum viscosities of ν 0 500 and 2000 m2 s 1 perform slightly worse with respect to minimizing spurious dissipation while remaining numerically stable fig 4a increased minimum viscosity tends to stabilize the leith viscosity scheme but also reduces total ke slightly fig 4a consequently we select the reynolds viscosity as our default viscosity scheme 3 2 2 viscosity backscatter combinations related to the choice of the viscosity is the backscatter implementation as it uses the viscous energy dissipation to estimate the amount of uke available for the backscatter even though the leith scheme without backscatter tends to be more dissipative than the reynolds scheme in combination with backscatter the leith scheme over energizes the flow and produces far too much surface ke in the 1 4 setup when compared to the high resolution reference ref 1 12 consequently the reynolds scheme performs generally better with backscatter than the leith scheme fig 4d still the leith scheme also equilibrates within the five year run and does not spin up infinitely figs 4d and 5c looking at the detailed daily averaged energy tendency contributions we see that in the leith case backscatter tends to inject more energy than viscosity removes fig 5c even though the excessive injection of energy is small at the surface it is relative to the rate of viscous dissipation much larger in the subsurface and near the bottom while the backscatter equation eqs 8 and 12 is designed to balance energy removal and injection e varies in time and space and the balance is neither local nor instantaneous the scheme may potentially inject more or alternatively considerably less energy than is globally removed at a particular instance of time furthermore the inclusion of backscatter increases the spatially and temporally varying viscosity coefficient as well as it energizes the flow which the viscosity scheme tries to counteract compare amplitudes in fig 5a with those in fig 5b f therefore a new balance between viscosity and backscatter is created which varies in both components and for both time and space this balance can potentially either lean toward too much dissipation or too much backscatter for the leith scheme the latter is the case the backscatter is only directly controlling the injection of ke into the flow but not the conversion of potential to kinetic energy as the flow is fed by a temperature relaxation at the boundaries eq 2 an excessively turbulent flow may modify eddy heat fluxes from an effectively infinite heat reservoir at the walls increasing the release of potential energy in the leith backscatter setup the standard deviations in w and temperature are much larger than in the 1 12 reference not shown this might be a result of the spatially strongly varying leith viscosity which also imprints onto the backscatter as a result the reynolds scheme is chosen as the default backscatter scheme 3 2 3 backscatter parameter r dis backscatter amplitude changing r dis has only minor effects on the total ke of the simulation fig 4b low values of r dis correspond to a reduced backscatter amplitude and show some effect by reducing total ke fig 4b although sensitivity to this parameter is considerably smaller than what is reported by klöwer et al 2018 one of the reasons is that our setup does not have a pronounced turbulent boundary layer as can be found near complex bottom topography coast lines or in the case of western boundary currents we expect that this parameter will have more impact once we test the backscatter in global ocean simulations aside from the surface ke another indicator for the effect of this parameter is the balance of backscatter vs viscosity energy tendencies fig 5d f decreasing this parameter leads to a balance that is more dissipative i e favors the viscosity energy tendencies increasing this parameter leads to a balance that injects more energy the equilibrium levels of viscous and backscatter energy tendencies change with lower values of r dis injecting less energy and consequently leading to reduced total viscous dissipation as the flow is slightly less turbulent fig 5e 3 2 4 backscatter parameter c0 temporal smoothing the temporal uke smoothing controls the timescale of the energy release from the uke reservoir and is governed by c 0 it shows an impact on ke only when the parameter is reduced substantially i e when temporal smoothing is high fig 4c however it has a considerable impact on the uke equation not shown as it can prevent the occurrence of negative uke values when c 0 is decreased we found a good balance between a smooth mostly positive uke and high values of total ke with a parameter choice of 0 1 which is smaller than reported by jansen et al 2015 probably due to the fact that our implementation needs a stronger spatial and temporal smoothing for the uke equation 3 2 5 backscatter parameters n 1 n 2 n 3 spatial smoothing spatial smoothing is applied to each of the following three terms i the dissipated energy term which forces the uke equation ii the backscattered energy term which dissipates energy in the uke equation and iii the actual backscatter tendency contribution to the velocity field u the filter settings are described by a triple of integers n 1 n 2 n 3 which specify the number of iterated filter cycles in i ii and iii respectively spatial smoothing does not affect the total surface ke much fig 4e it is however crucial for model stability and the prevention of negative uke also the backscatter tendency in the momentum equation needs sufficient smoothing to reinject energy at scales larger than the dominant scales of viscous dissipation especially higher resolution setups are sensitive to the number of smoothing cycles not shown we found that n 1 n 2 n 3 2 2 4 is a good choice with regard to model stability and smallest amount of total energy dissipation for all tested resolutions this suggests a sufficient scale separation of the backscatter and viscosity operators even for high wavenumber resolving simulations where the backscatter is small 3 2 6 sign definite vs sign indefinite formulation we analyzed the effect of the sign indefinite v compared to the sign definite v formulation of the energy tendency operators in the uke equation fig 4f the sign definite formulation remains numerically stable and is more energetic than the reference simulation without backscatter ref 1 4 it also does not need as many spatial smoothing cycles or potentially as low a value for c 0 to keep the model numerically stable compared to the sign indefinite version furthermore the leith sign definite version performs just as well as the reynolds sign definite version without the excessive injection of energy seen for the sign indefinite leith backscatter scheme this points to the flux components of the viscous dissipation rate v i e the first term on the right of eq 7 as the main cause of excessive energy injection for the sign indefinite leith scheme however all sign definite versions are clearly outperformed by the sign indefinite reynolds scheme in terms of improved surface ke this observation indicates that the flux components in eq 7 are relevant and necessary contributions for a good performance of the backscatter scheme in this setup 3 2 7 decision on the default scheme based on the sensitivity studies we choose the following default scheme viscosity is implemented by the biharmonic reynolds scheme the energy source and sink terms to the uke equation are chosen in their sign indefinite form with parameter r dis 1 the temporal smoothing parameter is taken to be c 0 0 1 and the number of filtering cycles is 2 2 4 for smoothing the source term in the uke model the sink term in the uke model and the backscatter forcing in the momentum equation respectively the two default backscatter setups for the two lower resolutions are back 1 4 and back 1 6 see table 1 both setups reach similar levels of surface ke as the reference ref 1 12 fig 4d 3 3 impact of the default backscatter scheme 3 3 1 simulated flow hereafter we give a detailed assessment of the flow which is simulated with the default backscatter setup total ke in the lower resolution runs with backscatter is restored to a level comparable to the level at much higher eddy resolving resolution we note that backscatter actually increases the rate of viscous dissipation however this loss is balanced by the backscatter energy injection fig 5b and d up to a level where the balance between the two is closer to total ke conservation than the rate of viscous energy loss in the high resolution 1 12 reference compare to fig 5a the improved energy balance is also visible in the total ke of the default scheme at 1 4 resolution at different model layer depths fig 6a b and c ke is increased by about 50 in all layers to a level comparable to ref 1 12 in the surface layer energy spectra backscatter leads to an increased energy across the entire spectrum near the northern and southern boundaries and in the center of the channel both for the 1 4 and 1 6 simulations not shown however the increase in spectral power through backscatter does not necessarily rectify the structure of the mean flow at lower resolution to the structure observed in ref 1 12 the lower resolution runs without backscatter ref 1 4 and ref 1 6 have a bimodal zonal mean flow but ref 1 12 is unimodal even though the bimodal structure collapses to a unimodal one in back 1 4 the location and width of the mean flow peak is not quite the same as in ref 1 12 fig 2a and b in back 1 6 the flow stays bimodal although the jets are getting closer fig 2d and e as a consequence line spectra at different locations do not always match the high resolution reference not shown total mean ke and eke in the different layers on the other hand are similar between the backscatter simulations and the high resolution reference figs 2 and 4d the question to which degree backscatter schemes are capable of rectifying the spatial structure and strength of the mean flow will need to be addressed in follow up studies aside from ke and eke backscatter also considerably improves other layer mean quantities such as the standard deviation of w and of t fig 3 while the improvement is not quite strong enough to totally alleviate errors in these fields in back 1 4 the results in back 1 6 show a remarkably good match with ref 1 12 this is especially noteworthy since the backscatter scheme injects ke only into the horizontal momentum equation eq 4 it does not directly affect the variability of t or w nonetheless the improved representation of eddies in the system leads to a corresponding improvement in the variability of other fields as well on the other hand the horizontal mean flow biases which are still present in the backscatter simulations are also visible in these other flow variables as they are affected by the position of the mean current not shown however many flow properties can be represented on a 1 4 mesh with backscatter nearly as well as on a 1 12 mesh without backscatter the additional computational costs for backscatter are around 50 in this setup with only one tracer equation and including all the high frequency output this is a very small amount of additional costs compared to those resulting from a resolution increase from 1 4 to 1 12 the 1 12 is at least 30 times more expensive in theory and is often even more expensive in practice 3 3 2 unresolved kinetic energy details the uke of the backscatter scheme nicely scales with resolution as expected fig 7b although the general horizontal structure of the subgrid energy is quite similar between the resolutions the difference between the northern and southern part of the domain is more pronounced in back 1 4 than in back 1 6 this might be one of the reasons why in back 1 4 the mean flow representation looks better than in back 1 6 another noteworthy aspect is that uke drops to about one third its maximum value from surface to bottom fig 7a justifying the use of a vertically variable uke as designed the backscatter parametrization tends to act on larger scales than the viscosity parametrization compare fig 7h and fig 7i the smoothing of the two energy tendency contributions to the uke equation fig 7e and f ensures that the uke field is sufficiently smooth and mostly positive at each timestep fig 7d and positive when layer averaged fig 7a both contributions are large at similar locations following the flow structure but smoothed in time and space the energy contribution from the backscatter term eq 13 to the momentum equation has a very similar form as the sink term in the uke equation eq 11b with the exception of being spatially slightly more distinct in structure compare fig 7f to 7g the actual energy injection by the backscatter has a very similar unimodal structure at the surface compared to the surface total ke and eke of ref 1 12 fig 7c only the peak of the energy injection is slightly more northward around 40 n 41 n compared to the reference simulation ke peak around 38 n and the eke peak around 38 n 40 n the zonally averaged backscatter energy tendency of the momentum equation also looks much smoother in space than the actual uke compare fig 7b to 7c 4 variable grid simulations we test the effect of backscatter on a grid with zonally varying resolution the zonal extent is increased to 40 where about half of the domain is eddy permitting while the other half is eddy resolving with transition zones between the two grid resolutions fig 8 these transition zones are relatively sharp in this setup and therefore present a somewhat extreme testcase as a high resolution reference for the mixed resolution simulations we keep the equidistant grid ref 1 12 simulation with zonal extent of 20 used in the previous section 4 1 reference simulation without backscatter in the reference simulation without backscatter ref m an imprint of the local resolution is clearly visible in the daily means of all fields fig 9a b c the high resolution part of the domain is also visible in the temporal means of for example surface eke fig 10b and in the standard deviation of sea surface height fig 10c further imprints of the resolution change can also be found in the vertical structure of mean eke fig 11a and standard deviation of temperature fig 11b and w fig 11c once the flow enters the high resolution part of the domain all these fields become more intense and reach deeper down once they leave the high resolution part they return back to much smaller values for a detailed discussion of these observations see danilov and wang 2015 the mean flow shows an artifact of the resolution change visible for example in the mean ke fig 10a in the low resolution region just upstream of the high resolution part around 0 5 longitude the flow shows a wave like excursion as if confronted with an obstacle further the length of the high resolution domain in this grid configuration does not seem sufficient to saturate the vertical structure of for example eke since there is still a zonal slope in this field at the downstream end of the high resolution domain fig 11a this suggests that equilibrium amplitudes i e those corresponding to a purely high resolution simulation of this and other fields are not reached compared to ref 1 12 ref m underestimates the amplitudes of the flow fields when looking at zonal averages fig 12a b c d and the vertical structure of layer averages fig 12e f g h furthermore even though ref m does reproduce the unimodal structure of the mean flow the peak in the mean flow is slightly too far north this is caused by the northward excursion of the spurious wave pattern described above from which the flow cannot fully recover even in the high resolution domain 4 2 impact of default backscatter setup 4 2 1 simulated flow the effect of backscatter in the mixed resolution setup back m is very similar to the effect in the equidistant mesh configurations generally ke and eke are considerably increased especially in the low resolution part of the channel fig 10d and e the pattern of ke and also of t and ssh variability is much more zonally uniform for back m fig 10d e f reducing the visible imprint of the resolution change on these fields this is also true for the vertical structure of the flow i e meridionally averaged ke and eke and meridionally averaged standard deviation of t and w fig 11d e f daily means of w at 100 m depth sst and surface vorticity are also much more uniform fig 9d e f to the point where the visible imprint of the change of resolution is substantially reduced backscatter does however not reduces the wave like disturbance upstream of the high resolution subdomain fig 10a if anything it reenergizes this flow anomaly as the structure is already present in ref m the inclusion of backscatter just strengthens it rather than removing it from the flow backscatter enhanced imprints of the anomaly are also visible in the vertical flow structure for layer averaged eke and for the variability of t fig 11d and e back m is slightly more energetic in terms of total ke and slightly more variable in fields such as t ssh and w when compared to ref 1 12 see the zonal surface layer averages and the vertical structure of total layer averages in fig 12 the reason is that back m also allows for backscatter in the part of the domain which is resolved at 1 12 while ref 1 12 does not include any backscatter in general backscatter reenergizes the flow not only at the surface but at all vertical layers the typical increase of layer ke is about 30 between ref m and back m and brings the backscatter simulation close to ref 1 12 fig 12e 4 2 2 unresolved kinetic energy details backscatter is especially active in regions with low resolution hence strong dissipation fig 13d in the high resolution part of the domain backscatter is more active in the northern central part of the domain where the mean flow is strong and eddy scales are small therefore even pushing the limits of an eddy resolving simulation at 1 12 resolution fig 13d the same pattern is visible in daily mean snapshots of uke fig 13c interestingly time averaged uke actually exhibits slightly negative values near the surface in the middle of the channel in the high resolution part of the domain dark blue areas in fig 13a and b while backscatter is sometimes active to energize the flow in this region fig 13c and d there are substantial periods where the backscatter scheme is switched off due to local depletion of uke the 1 12 resolution is already so high that backscatter is inactive more often than not backscatter is also active in the high resolution part of the domain because a the mean flow transports under resolved eddies from the low resolution part into the high resolution part and b the mean flow distortion is rectified when the flow enters the high resolution region the vertical uke structure shows a slight increase of uke when moving from mid depth of about 1000 m further down toward the bottom as discussed above the flow reaches higher energy levels and flow variability once it enters the high resolution region even though it does not saturate before it returns to the low resolution region for mean eke this is especially pronounced at depth see fig 11a for ref m this in turn affects local dissipation consequently uke is affected in back m as well such visible variations in uke with depth highlight the necessity to maintain a three dimensional uke field to capture the varying dissipation rates between vertical layers 5 discussion and outlook we developed an energy backscatter parametrization based on previous studies by jansen et al 2015 and klöwer et al 2018 the parametrization is energetically more consistent and less dissipative than classical eddy viscosity parametrizations at the same time it maintains sufficient dissipation of enstrophy to preserve numerical stability our sensitivity studies showed that energy backscatter is able to balance the viscosity energy tendencies and that it reinjects the right amount of energy back into the flow on larger scales without violating model stability the nonlinear upscale energy transfer of the resolved flow then distributes the reinjected energy in a physically realistic way an important aspect both for the theoretical design of backscatter and for the observed numerical stability of the scheme is the necessity of temporal and spatial smoothing temporal smoothing simulates the delay of uke release back into the mean flow spatial smoothing is necessary to release the energy on larger scales than where it is dissipated certainly the existence of a grid mode in our finite volume discretization adds to the amount of smoothing cycles that are needed to keep the model numerically stable and the unresolved energy smooth and mostly positive in the reentrant channel setup of this study the low resolution simulations without backscatter were far too dissipative thus deficient in the level of total kinetic energy and in the level of flow variability when compared to an eddy resolving 1 12 simulation without backscatter the 1 4 simulation had only about 60 70 of the reference kinetic energy the 1 6 simulation had an energy defect of around 20 with backscatter these energy deficits are entirely rectified moreover the variability of for example temperature and of vertical velocity improved to the point where they are nearly indistinguishable from the reference while characteristics of the mean flow are also improved the backscatter parametrization cannot entirely rectify a mean flow bias the next more challenging step following this idealized channel setup will be the implementation of backscatter in a global ocean configuration we expect that some adjustments will be necessary first the current test case has no complex bottom topography along complex ocean floor structures physical dissipation is a relevant ke sink so that backscatter would need to be reduced or switched off entirely to prevent reinjection of the dissipated energy backscatter might also lead to numerical instabilities if it is too strong similar considerations apply to complex boundaries e g along to the western flanks of the strong western boundary currents the parameter r dis might take care of such backscatter damping in a physically consistent way as reported by klöwer et al 2018 but it might become necessary to adapt r dis to the basin geometry or to otherwise redesign the part of the parametrization that defines how much dissipated energy is actually entering the uke regime and is available for backscatter second changes in resolution on unstructured grids might still become a problem although we showed that the scheme works well for rapidly changing grid resolution a more complex structure of the transition zones might still lead to issues that are not covered by our current study while uke should scale with resolution issues might still arise for very high resolution parts of a global mesh configuration where backscatter is no longer desired at all future studies will have to address issues regarding model stability brought about by the coupling with the uke equation while the highly spatially and temporally varying viscosity coefficient employed in this study might be a better subgrid eddy closure than the one varying only according to the grid resolution which has previously been applied in the context of kinetic energy backscatter it also is more difficult to combine with the backscatter scheme this is evidenced by the overenergizing of the mean flow when combining backscatter with the harmonic leith and biharmonic background viscosity adding vertical layers to the uke field requires extra effort but was found necessary for reasons of stability and model performance furthermore there is a strong interplay between the details of the numerical scheme and the details of the backscatter closure different schemes will raise additional questions that need to be solved more or less individually smoothing in this context is a powerful tool to distinguish between the large scale flow and eddy and backscatter scales as also discussed by berloff 2018 one aspect that is certainly worth further investigation is the question with what kind of spatial structure the energy should be backscattered while we need to have a scale separation between dissipation and backscatter it is not clear what the exact structure of the respective operators or the related smoothing should be it seems sensible that energy should be backscattered close to where it is dissipated unless uke advection is significant which is currently not clear generally energy should mostly be injected where the model is dynamically active or should be active compared to higher resolutions the latter is not necessarily predictable alternative approaches to ocean backscatter also include stochastic implementations cooper 2017 cooper and zanna 2015 jansen and held 2014 mana and zanna 2014 where the unresolved eddy effects are simulated by stochastic patterns a combination of a stochastic and the here presented deterministic approach are feasible where the deterministic part tracks the backscatter amplitude and approximate location while the stochastic patterns distribute the energy locally in a random fashion furthermore certain parameters as part of the backscatter scheme are related to high uncertainties that could be tackled by stochastic components following implementations by for example juricke et al 2017 2018 an example in this context would be the parameter r dis which when chosen in a specific regime does not seem to affect model stability very much but would affect the total amount of backscattered energy additionally it is of interest to study how backscatter affects higher order eddy statistics such as eddy size and life time these properties are not directly included in the backscatter scheme but are certainly affected by the backscatter forcing of the flow furthermore the impact of backscatter on the mean flow deserves much closer attention finally there are other aspects of the energy cycle that are not addressed by our backscatter parametrization one example is numerical energy dissipation through time stepping and horizontal discretization this loss of kinetic energy is not captured by the uke equation other examples are the generally underestimated growth rates of baroclinic instabilities barham et al 2018 and the conversion of potential to kinetic energy which are also affected by the resolution and the capability of the model to fully resolve mesoscale and even submesoscale structures with backscatter the conversion might be improved by increased eke but we will have to investigate the full energy cycle including potential energy conversion in future studies with more realistic forcing the current results suggest that there is potential for savings in terms of computing cost of more than one order of magnitude without degrading the level of mean kinetic and eddy kinetic energy on a lower resolution grid acknowledgments this paper is a contribution to the projects m3 and s2 of the

computational resources were supplied by the supercomputing facilities at the alfred wegener institute in bremerhaven appendix a leith viscosity scheme an alternative to the biharmonic reynolds viscosity with coefficient following eq 5 relies on the leith and modified leith viscosities fox kemper and menemenlis 2008 a 1 ν c l 0 0 2 min s c s c c d u c 2 c l q c 2 ν 0 s c s r s c δ t with the minimum function serving to taper the viscosity to ensure that the cfl condition is not violated here q k u denotes the vertical vorticity and c d c l are constants on the order of one the term ν 0 s c s r provides a resolution scaled minimum viscosity where ν 0 is the constant minimum viscosity coefficient and s r 5 8 109 m2 as before the leith viscosity can be associated with the scaling laws for 2d turbulence in the enstrophy range fox kemper and menemenlis 2008 since it is already scale selective it is used with the harmonic operator a recent study by pearson et al 2017 shows that this form of viscosity generally leads to smaller total dissipation than the biharmonic one with quasi uniform coefficient however it is nonuniform in space and may be insufficient to damp a grid mode where ν c l0 is small it is therefore run in combination with small background biharmonic viscosity with coefficient a 2 ν c bb max 0 u 0 bb s c 1 2 ν c l 0 where u 0 bb 0 01 ms 1 so that the background viscosity is active only when the harmonic leith viscosity is small the numerical factors in the formulas above are obtained experimentally as to prevent buildup of grid scale noise in the vertical velocity field they differ from those in pearson et al 2017 because of the differences in mesh geometry and discretization the leith viscosity coefficient is rather patchy in our simulations and is smoothed with a spatial filter f defined in eq c 3 so that ν c l f 2 c c ν c l 0 here f 2 denotes the composition of f with itself and einstein summation over the repeated index c running over neighbors of c is implied appendix b approximate viscosity operators b 1 approximate harmonic viscosity operator to compute the viscous force in the discrete case one needs to estimate the components of the stress tensor σ at the edges of the triangular cell the components can be easily computed either at cell centroids or at vertices and then averaged to edges as it turns out the resulting divergence of σ on the triangle c involves the velocities at neighboring triangles i e those sharing the same edges only with small weights which reduce to zero on equilateral meshes as a consequence the difference between the velocities on triangle c and neighboring triangles c only weakly contributes to the viscous force it will therefore fail to damp a grid mode for a discussion on spurious modes on triangular grids see e g roux 2012 for this reason we define an approximate viscous operator v which acts dissipatively on the grid mode via b 1 v u c 1 s c c n c u c u c ℓ c c r c c ν c ν c 2 where n c is the set of triangles having a common edge with c ℓ c c is the length of the edge between cells c and c r c c is the vector pointing from the centroid of cell c to the centroid of cell c and s c as before when the mesh cells are equilateral triangles u c u c r c c is the velocity gradient in the direction of the outward normal to the edge between c and c so that the right of eq b 1 is the sum of viscous fluxes leaving cell c thus defining a consistent discretization of the harmonic viscosity operator v u ν u although this interpretation is only approximate on general meshes we use the formula above as a substitute for the harmonic viscosity operator see also the discussion of different viscosity operator options for fesom2 in danilov et al 2017 since the geometric quantities in eq b 1 and the mean viscosity are defined on edges they can be incorporated into a generalized edge viscosity ν c c which is symmetric between c and c so that eq b 1 takes the form b 2 v u c 1 s c c n c u c u c ν c c summing over all cells c c s c v u c 0 because the difference between u c and u c appears with opposite signs in the expressions for cell c and c hence momentum is globally preserved furthermore taking the total viscous dissipation c s c v c s c u c v u c we observe that the contribution from c and c appears twice one time as ν cc u c u c u c and the other time as ν c c u c u c u c which sum to ν c c u c u c 2 note that this rearrangement is equivalent to operations in eq 7 with the flux contribution disappearing because of the area sum this proves that area mean kinetic energy dissipation is non positive and introduces a discrete equivalent of the sign definite dissipation rate v see eq 7 namely b 3 v c c ν c c s c c u c u c 2 which is associated with the area s c c s c s c 3 around the edge c c it is conservatively remapped to a cell dissipation rate b 4 v c 1 3 c n c v c c if layer thicknesses vary the coefficients must vary with volume rather than area b 2 approximate biharmonic viscosity operator a discrete biharmonic viscosity operator is obtained by applying an expression of the form of eq b 1 twice to avoid splitting the viscosity coefficient between the two harmonic operators we define b 5 l u c c n c u c u c which we can represent by a symmetric matrix l c c where l c c 1 if c c have a common edge and zero otherwise and l cc c n c l c c then l u c l c c u c where summation over repeated indices is implied we further define an operator n whose matrix representation is diagonal with n cc ν c b then the discrete biharmonic operator defined via b 6 v b u c 1 s c lnl u c 1 s c l cn n nm l mj u j is symmetric and negative as can be shown by taking the dot product with u c and summing over all cells as for the case of harmonic viscosity this suggests a sign definite expression for the energy dissipation rate defined on cells b 7 v c b ν c b s c l u c 2 it is convenient to specify the coefficient of biharmonic viscosity in terms of its harmonic equivalent by setting ν c b s c ν c no summation implied which is assumed in our implementation appendix c smoothing filter as discussed in the main text we require smoothing filters in several places of our implementation of backscatter to smooth the leith coefficient of viscosity to smooth the diagnosed dissipation rate v and most importantly to ensure that the energy returned back to the flow is free of small scales our filters are powers of a single filtering operator the composition of averaging from cell centroids to common vertices denoted x with averaging from vertices back to centroids denoted c let a c be any quantity defined at cells its vertex values a v are obtained as c 1 a v x a v c c v a c s c c c v s c where c v denotes the set of cells containing vertex v letting x vc denote the associated matrix symbol we can also write a v x vc a c similarly for a quantity b v defined on vertices we define its cell values b c via c 2 b c c b c 1 3 v v c b v where v c is the set of vertices of cell c finally we set c 3 f cx the effective spatial smoothing length of eq c 3 varies with grid resolution however the filter can be applied several times to increase the smoothing length for example the leith viscosity is filtered twice which can be written as f 2 
24034,numerical discretization with a finite difference scheme is known to introduce frequency dispersion in depth integrated long wave models commonly used in tsunami research and hazard mapping while prior studies on numerical dispersion focused on the linear shallow water equations we include the non hydrostatic pressure and vertical velocity through a keller box scheme and investigate the properties of the resulting system in relation to a hydrostatic model fourier analysis of the discretized governing equations gives rise to a dispersion relation in terms of the water depth parameter as well as the time step grid size and wave direction the dispersion relation is illustrated by its lead order approximation derived from taylor series expansions as well as numerical experiments involving standing and progressive waves with uniform water depth interaction between the spatial discretization and non hydrostatic terms leads to significant reduction of numerical dispersion outside the shallow water range numerical dispersion also decreases for wave propagation oblique to the computational grid due to effective increase in spatial resolution the time step which counteracts numerical dispersion from spatial discretization only has secondary effects within the applicable range of courant numbers since the governing equations of the non hydrostatic model derived from the keller box scheme tend to underestimate dispersion in shoaling water the numerical effects are complementary in producing a solution closer to airy wave theory a case study of the 2011 tohoku tsunami illustrates the grid sensitivity and convergence properties in real world applications a properly selected grid size can achieve an accurate description of wave propagation over a wide range of water depth parameters across the ocean keywords numerical dispersion non hydrostatic models long wave propagation staggered finite difference scheme shallow water equations keller box scheme 1 introduction numerical long wave models have been an essential tool for tsunami research and hazard mapping conventional finite difference models based on the nonlinear shallow water equations are the primary choice due to their simple numerical frameworks low computing costs and ease of implementation e g imamura et al 1988 kowalik and bang 1987 liu et al 1995 titov and synolakis 1998 the hydrostatic governing equations describe wave propagation through the shallow water celerity independent of the wave period recent advances in sensor technology have enabled detection of intricate dispersive wave systems even in large catastrophic tsunamis hanson and bowman 2005 and kulikov 2006 deduced separation of wave components by period in hydrophone and altimetry records of the 2004 indian ocean tsunami saito et al 2010 and yamazaki et al 2011a identified strong frequency dispersion in ocean bottom pressure records of the 2010 chile and 2011 tohoku tsunamis the observations show lagging of short period components as tsunamis propagate across the ocean near the coast acoustic doppler current profiler adcp records have suggested these trailing tsunami waves are the primary energy source for persistent surges and strong currents in insular shelf and reef environments bricker et al 2007 cheung et al 2013 yamazaki et al 2012a dispersion is typically regarded as a high order property of tsunami waves but its influence on the amplitude and phase adds up across the ocean with significant contributions to the waveform researchers have been exploring the use of numerical means in shallow water models as well as high order properties in boussinesq type or non hydrostatic models to account for frequency dispersion during tsunami propagation discretization of hyperbolic differential equations introduces truncation errors that manifest as dispersion and dissipation in the solution the taylor series expansion which allows detailed step by step analysis of discretization errors is a classical approach to characterize the property of these numerical artifacts abbott et al 1984 warming and hyett 1974 trans oceanic propagation of tsunamis is primarily a linear process because the wave amplitude is small compared to the water depth imamura et al 1988 analyzed the staggered finite difference scheme with leap frog time integration for the linear shallow water equations and showed the grid size and time step can be adjusted to match the lead order term of the dispersion relation from the boussinesq type equations of peregrine 1967 this approach can numerically describe wave dispersion over a range of water depth parameters around shallow water shuto 1991 and burwell et al 2007 showed the lead order approximation can be maintained in varying water depth through adjustment of the grid size for modeling of one dimensional long wave propagation cho 1995 extended the method to two dimensions by including corrections in the discretized shallow water equations to mimic the cross derivative dispersion terms in the boussinesq type equations instead of adjusting the grid size locally cho et al 2007 and ha and cho 2015 introduced variable coefficients in the correction terms to accommodate variation of water depth yoon 2002 proposed a variant of the approach by employing a hidden grid in the discretized governing equations with resolution tuned to mimic the lead order dispersion property at the local water depth wang and liu 2011 adopted this approach to manipulate numerical dispersion for weakly nonlinear and weakly dispersive waves propagating over slowly varying water depth with a shallow water model more advanced depth integrated models can describe dispersion mathematically over a wide range of water depth parameters through the governing equations one approach is to include high order terms in the nonlinear shallow water equations through a taylor series expansion of the dispersion relation from airy wave theory peregrine 1967 this gives rise to the boussinesq type equations of varying complexity commonly used in modeling of wind generated waves e g madsen et al 1991 nwogu 1993 wei and kirby 1995 gobbi et al 2000 boussinesq type models have also been implemented to account for dispersion in trans oceanic tsunami propagation e g horrillo et al 2006 kirby et al 2013 saito et al 2014 baba et al 2017 an alternate approach to describe dispersive waves is to directly include the non hydrostatic pressure and vertical velocity through the keller box scheme without increasing the order of the governing equations stelling and zijlema 2003 while a one layer model is sufficient for tsunami modeling yamazaki et al 2009 additional layers instead of higher order derivatives are used to improve linear and nonlinear properties for modeling of wind generated waves e g zijlema et al 2011 bai and cheung 2013 smit et al 2014 the relatively simple numerical framework allows implementation of a two way grid nesting scheme for modeling of tsunamis from trans oceanic propagation to coastal runup e g yamazaki et al 2011b bai et al 2018a the vertical velocity also facilitates modeling of kinematic seafloor deformation to provide a more complete account of tsunami generation and the near field wave dynamics for inference of earthquake rupture processes e g yamazaki et al 2011a 2018 lay et al 2013 lay et al 2013 li et al 2016b bai et al 2018b the governing equations of boussinesq type and non hydrostatic models can account for dispersion to varying degree of accuracy in relation to the exact solution from airy wave theory while the dispersion relation of the boussinesq type equations converges asymptotically at the shallow water limit the low order depth integration accompanying the keller box scheme in the non hydrostatic approach leads to slight underestimation of dispersion in shoaling water bai et al 2018c this is complicated by the discretization scheme which introduces truncation errors associated with the time step and grid size that interfere with the dispersion property intrinsic to the governing equations furthermore the intrinsic property itself is a mathematical approximation of the exact solution understanding of the numerical and intrinsic properties is crucial for selection of computational grids that can most appropriately account for physical dispersion and make efficient use of computing resources however the truncation error analysis based on the taylor series expansion becomes very cumbersome with the high order derivatives in the boussinesq type equations vitousek and fringer 2011 decoupled the intrinsic and numerical dispersion by assuming the water depth parameter is small and examined how superposition of numerical dispersion from a shallow water model to the intrinsic properties of the one dimensional boussinesq type and kdv equations would modify internal wave propagation as the dispersion properties from those governing equations are highly accurate around shallow water the discretization errors inevitably lead to overestimation of dispersion in the numerical solution baba et al 2017 pointed out the need to use a very small grid size to suppress numerical dispersion in a boussinesq type model for computation of tsunami propagation numerical dispersion is present regardless of the governing equations as along as a finite grid size is used in the computation however the discretization errors can potentially alleviate the underestimation of dispersion by the governing equations of depth integrated non hydrostatic models the one layer formulation which provides the basic building block for multilayer models serves as a proxy for examination of numerical dispersion in the non hydrostatic approach in this study the non hydrostatic system of linear governing equations is discretized with a staggered finite difference scheme in the two dimensional horizontal plane and the keller box approach in the vertical direction the non hydrostatic terms involving the pressure and vertical velocity present a challenge in the taylor series expansion even though the governing equations remain at first order the truncation error in the non hydrostatic pressure is dependent on other variables effectively introducing high order terms through recursive operations numerical dispersion is not directly additive to the intrinsic property of the non hydrostatic system as demonstrated in the comparative model study of li et al 2016a and their interaction remains a topic for investigation the fourier method provides a straightforward procedure to derive the dispersion relation without expanding the high order and cross derivative terms as would be the case in the taylor approach with the dispersion relation expressed in terms of the discretization parameters and aided by numerical experiments and a case study we explore the coupling between intrinsic and numerical dispersion the anisotropic propagation property over a two dimensional computation grid the use of numerical dispersion to offset errors intrinsic to the governing equations and the manifestation of numerical dispersion in hydrostatic and non hydrostatic modeling of tsunamis across the ocean with varying bathymetry 2 governing equations the non hydrostatic free surface flow is defined by a cartesian coordinate system x y z with the x and y axes in the horizontal plane and the positive z axis pointing upward from the still water level let g denote the acceleration due to gravity h the water depth and n the manning roughness coefficient the depth integrated governing equations define conservation of momentum in the x y and z directions as well as continuity of flow in the horizontal

depth averaged velocity ζ is the surface elevation d ζ h is the flow depth and q denotes the depth averaged non hydrostatic pressure the governing equations augment the nonlinear shallow water system with the non hydrostatic pressure terms in the horizontal momentum equations 1 and 2 and the addition of the vertical momentum equation 3 the continuity equation 4 remains the same as in the shallow water equations to ensure conservation of mass the keller box scheme in stelling and zijlema 2003 defines the variables at the free surface and seabed in deriving the horizontal momentum equations 1 and 2 the trapezoidal rule along with the dynamic free surface boundary condition are invoked to approximate the depth averaged non hydrostatic pressure as 5 q 1 d h ζ q dz 1 2 q ζ q b 1 2 q b where q b and q ζ denote the non hydrostatic pressure at the bottom and free surface the same rule integrates the vertical velocity w to give the depth averaged w in the momentum equation 3 as 6 w 1 d h ζ w

the vertical velocity over depth the non hydrostatic pressure should follow a quadratic distribution jeschke et al 2017 but is also approximated as linear in the depth integration 5 following the keller box scheme this approximation leads to slight underestimation of dispersion in shoaling water with non asymptotic convergence at the shallow water limit even for a multi layer model bai et al

for the flow velocity in the horizontal momentum equations 15 and 16 and implicit for the surface elevation in the continuity equation 18 the use of the horizontal velocity at m 1 in the time integration of the surface elevation introduces second order truncation properties identical to the commonly used leap frog scheme see appendix a while the spatial derivatives are approximated by second order central differences the semi implicit time integration stabilizes the computation kowalik and murty 1993 the leapfrog scheme which is explicit and second order can alternatively pair with the second order spatial discretization to integrate the solution in time with the same order of accuracy imamura et al 1988 liu et al 1995 zijlema et al 2011 smit et al 2014 the non hydrostatic pressure in the horizontal momentum equations 15 and 16 is defined at the new time step m 1 and is solved implicitly from a poisson type equation assembled from the mass conservation 19 a semi implicit solution approach evaluates the hydrostatic and non hydrostatic components in two steps chorin 1968 integration of eqs 15 and 16 with non hydrostatic pressure terms omitted provides an initial estimate for the horizontal velocity u v at m 1 substitution of u v and w expressed in terms of the non hydrostatic pressure q from the momentum equations 15 17 into the mass conservation 19 gives a matrix equation of poisson type as 20 δ t δ x 2 q i 1 j m 1 δ t δ x 2 q i 1 j m 1 δ t δ y 2 q i j 1 m 1 δ t δ y 2 q i j 1 m 1 2 δ t δ x 2 2 δ t δ y 2 4 δ t h 2 q i j m 1 u i 1 2 j m 1 u i 1 2

implicit solution for the non hydrostatic pressure q at m 1 the velocity u v w is then updated from integration of the non hydrostatic terms in the momentum equations 15 17 and ζ from the continuity equation 18 before proceeding to the next time step 3 fourier and taylor expansions the fourier expansion which has been a standard approach in deriving dispersion relations for governing equations of free surface flow is implemented here to study the propagation property of the non hydrostatic model formulated in section 2 the discretization transforms the governing differential equations into a system of algebraic equations which must be satisfied by each frequency component in the expansion the resulting eigenvalue matrix links the wave frequency and number as well as the discretization parameters in a dispersion relation this analytical technique has also been used to study numerical dispersion and stability in shallow water models e g leendertse 1967 foreman 1984 sankaranarayanan and spaulding 2003 its extension to the non hydrostatic system involves two additional variables with the rank of the eigen value matrix increased by two the resulting dispersion relation expressed in trigonometric functions can in turn be expanded by taylor series to illustrate systematically the order of truncation errors as in the conventional approach for the shallow water model imamura et al 1988 we consider a system of regular progressive waves on water of uniform depth for derivation of the dispersion relation the surface elevation ζ flow velocity u v w and non hydrostatic pressure q

demonstrate the inter relationship among the parameters in this section we focus on the dispersion properties of the non hydrostatic model with respect to airy wave theory and use results from the shallow water and boussinesq type equations as baselines for comparison introduction of the combined grid size time step and water depth parameter γ in the dispersion relation 43 allows elucidation of the convergence properties and provides guidance for practical application in tsunami modeling 4 1 asymptotic properties the lead order approximation 42 is derived from taylor series expansions of the trigonometric functions in the dispersion relation 38 and is valid for small values of the discretization parameters for examination of the asymptotic properties with kδx and ωδt 0 numerical dispersion and wave directionality vanish in the absence of discretization errors the expression reduces to 44 c gh 1 1 4 kh 2 1 2 which is the intrinsic dispersion relation of the continuous governing equations 9 13 eq 44 has the same structure as the dispersion relation of the boussinesq type equations from peregrine 1967 but has a coefficient of 1 4 instead of 1 3 for the water depth parameter the coefficient 1 4 is carried over from the dispersion term of the governing equations of the non hydrostatic system in boussinesq form bai et al 2018c a comparison between eqs 44 and 43 shows the discretization augments the order of the dispersion relation from a 0 2 to a 4 6 rational function along with introduction of the parameter γ for model optimization or error assessment numerical dispersion in shallow water models has been studied extensively here we seek to illustrate the property in terms of the water depth parameter when kh 0 the non hydrostatic terms in the governing equations vanish and the dispersion relation 42 reduces to 45 c gh 1 β 12 k δ x 2 1 12 cr 2 k δ x 2 1 2 setting β 1 results in the lead order dispersion relation for wave propagation along a principal axis the resulting expression is identical to that derived by imamura et al 1988 due to the use of the same staggered finite difference grid and the comparable time integration schemes to second order see appendix a substitution of δx 2 γh 2 ghδt 2 yields 46 c gh 1 γ 12 kh 2 1 2 where kh is reintroduced into the dispersion relation of the hydrostatic model to account for depth dependence of discretization errors imamura et al 1988 showed a value of γ 4 gives rise to 47 c gh 1 1 3 kh 2 1 2 which is the lead order expansion of the dispersion relation from the boussinesq type equations of peregrine 1967 a value of γ 3 results in a coefficient of 1 4 for the depth parameter providing a lead order approximation to the intrinsic dispersion relation 44 of the non hydrostatic system the propagation property from the governing equations boils down to the coefficient in the intrinsic dispersion relation the boussinesq type approach yields a coefficient of 1 3 with accurate results around the shallow water range and asymptotic convergence to airy wave theory at kh 0 the coefficient 1 4 which results from the linear non hydrostatic pressure profile in the depth integration 5 leads to slight underestimation of dispersion in shoaling water but better agreement with airy wave theory toward deep water bai et al 2018c an assumption of a quadratic profile for the non hydrostatic pressure can produce a coefficient of 1 3 equivalent to the boussinesq type equations jeschke et al 2017 discretization errors however are always present in the numerical solution even with an accurate account of dispersion from the governing equations a small grid size can help alleviate the numerical artifacts but will increase the computing cost and limit the model application the slightly weaker dispersion intrinsic in the governing equations of the non hydrostatic model provides an opportunity to accommodate discretization errors in matching the numerical solution with airy wave theory 4 2 inter relationship among parameters the lead order dispersion relation 42 shows the intrinsic property from the governing equations and its influence on the numerical contribution in separate terms the underlying expansion stands out the role of each parameter and its inter relationship with the others the water depth parameter kh lowers the celerity through intrinsic dispersion and interacts with the spatial and temporal discretizations to modulate the numerical property while the upper bound of the grid size parameter kδx is π the practical maximum is around one for resolution of a wavelength with at least six computational cells such that the denominator of the numerical dispersion term is always positive the wave direction parameter β has a range of 0 5 to 1 0 and the courant number cr must be less than 1 2 for wave propagation over a two dimensional grid the positive numerator indicates the primary role of the temporal discretization in increasing the celerity while reducing numerical dispersion in contrast the parameter kδx facilitates reduction of the celerity through the numerator and denominator of the numerical dispersion term the complementary effects of kh and kδx provide the basis for the use of spatial discretization errors to mimic dispersion in numerical wave models it is important to note that the presence of kh in the denominator indicates reduction of discretization errors with increasing water depth or intrinsic dispersion the exact dispersion relation 38 describes the celerity without assuming small values of the discretization parameters to aid interpretation of the property over the full range fig 2a plots the celerity over kδx and cr with the propagation direction along the x axis the depth parameter kh from 0 to 0 6 is most relevant to tsunami modeling bai and cheung 2016a the celerity decreases and dispersion increases with kh and kδx but vice versa with cr the courant number plays a secondary role in counteracting numerical dispersion because its coupling with kδx results in a combined fourth order term as shown in the lead order approximation 42 oblique wave propagation also reduces numerical dispersion fig 2b demonstrates the increased celerity with an oblique wave direction of 45 from the x axis the lead order dispersion relation 42 can provide an insight into the mechanism the parameter β can be incorporated into the discretization parameter as k β δ x to denote an effective grid size in the direction of wave propagation since β 1 the decrease in effective grid spacing reduces numerical dispersion for oblique wave propagation turning the waves to 45 with β 1 2 has the same effects on the celerity as a reduction of the grid size by a factor of 1 2 as illustrated geometrically in fig 1 the results also show increased influence of cr at the smaller value of β 0 5 as indicated in the lead order dispersion relation it is useful to investigate the interplay between intrinsic and numerical dispersion in matching airy wave theory we consider waves propagating along the x axis for illustration the concept of effective grid spacing can be applied to infer numerical dispersion for oblique wave directions fig 3 plots the celerity from the dispersion relation 38 normalized by the exact solution from airy wave theory over kδx and cr the celerity reduction or numerical dispersion is most prominent in the absence of intrinsic dispersion at kh 0 the governing equations of the hydrostatic and non hydrostatic models give higher predictions of the celerity in relation to airy wave theory when kh 0 numerical dispersion can offset the overestimation in matching the exact solution through a combination of spatial and temporal discretization errors the effects however are relatively mild and insensitive at small values of kδx the hydrostatic model requires a grid size of kδx 0 6 to achieve the correct dispersion property outside the shallow water range a slightly larger grid size is needed to counter the effects of temporal discretization within the applicable range of kδx numerical dispersion alone is not sufficient to match airy wave theory above kh 0 5 inclusion of the non hydrostatic terms in the governing equations alleviates this requirement and enables achievement of proper dispersion within the range of kδx for accurate resolution of tsunami waves 4 3 convergence with grid size and water depth a tsunami consists of a range of harmonics associated with the bathymetry at the source and the seafloor deformation from earthquake rupture recent advances in imaging techniques using combinations of global seismic waves region gps observations near field tsunami waveforms and coastal runup measurements have led to development of detailed source models for inference of earthquake rupture processes lay 2018 these source models involve complex patterns of heterogeneous slip and seafloor deformation with multiple length scales since the initial harmonics of a tsunami are defined spatially in terms of their wavelengths at the source dispersion is key to reproduction of the wave periods across the ocean as well as the subsequent resonance and impact near the coast it is therefore important for a numerical model to match the dispersion relation from airy wave theory over an appropriate range of water depth parameters beyond shallow water for practical applications the hydrostatic model in which numerical dispersion has been extensively studied provides a baseline for comparison fig 4a plots the normalized celerity from the dispersion relation 39 as a function of kh reintroduced by substitution of δx 2 γh 2 ghδt 2 since the time step size plays a secondary role in numerical dispersion we assign a small value of cr 0 01 to focus on the effects of spatial discretization with δt 0 the combined grid size and depth parameter γ δx h 2 relates the numerical component of the model celerity versus the intrinsic component from the governing equations in defining the propagation property across the ocean the results illustrate strong dependence of numerical dispersion on γ and kh at γ 0 the lack of dispersion in the shallow water equations results in substantial overestimation of the celerity with increasing kh increasing the value of γ leads to numerical dispersion that in turn reduces the celerity a value of γ 4 which reproduces the lead order term of the dispersion relation from the boussinesq type equations of peregrine 1967 provides a very good approximation of the celerity from airy wave theory around shallow water the results show a 0 53 error at kh 0 6 around the upper bound of the tsunami range the celerity is quite sensitive to γ especially outside shallow water through local adjustment of the grid size with water depth wang and liu 2011 managed to mimic the lead order dispersion property over varying bathymetry by maintaining γ 4 using a hydrostatic model the discretization errors can similarly be tuned to augment the dispersion relation 38 of the non hydrostatic model for improved wave propagation characteristics as shown in fig 4b a large value of γ 4 results in excess numerical dispersion leading to underestimation of the celerity even within the shallow water range reducing γ leads to increase of the celerity but at a lower rate over a smaller range comparing to the hydrostatic model results in fig 4a in comparison to airy wave theory the intrinsic dispersion relation at γ 0 slightly underestimates dispersion for kh 2 4 a value of γ 0 8 introduces the right amount of numerical dispersion to offset the underestimation and reproduces the celerity up to kh 0 6 and 1 2 with less than 0 13 and 0 77 error comparing to airy wave theory the resulting dispersion relation follows closely the boussineq type equations of peregrine 1967 for tsunami modeling and has slightly better performance over most of the intermediate depth range tuning of numerical dispersion in the non hydrostatic model might provide a computationally efficient alternative instead of additional layers for modeling of surf zone processes involving wind generated waves the governing equations account for a significant portion of physical dispersion and reduce the effects of spatial discretization with increasing kh numerical dispersion also becomes less sensitive to γ when compared to the hydrostatic model results the optimal grid size parameter of γ 0 8 can provide an accurate description of broad band tsunami waves over varying bathymetry 5 numerical experiments the validity and interpretation of the dispersion relation 38 are illustrated through a series of numerical experiments using the hydrostatic and non hydrostatic modes of neowave yamazaki et al 2009 2011b which is based on the staggered finite difference keller box and semi implicit time integration schemes described in section 2 neowave has been validated with the laboratory and field benchmarks of the national tsunami hazard mitigation program for hazard mapping and assessment yamazaki et al 2012b bai et al 2015 the use of a single computer code in this comparative study allows examination of the hydrostatic and non hydrostatic results from the same model input and setting for the subtle difference in numerical dispersion associated with grid spacing we first consider standing waves in a flume to examine computational errors from the implicit solution of the non hydrostatic pressure and then illustrate effects of numerical dispersion in modeling of progressive waves on water of uniform depth 5 1 standing waves in a flume the dispersion relation 38 of the non hydrostatic model is independent of the implicit solution of the pressure poisson equation 20 the effects of the solution scheme and its computational errors on dispersion are examined through a one dimensional numerical experiment dispersion in a numerical model can be evaluated from regular standing waves of a given length in a flume of uniform depth bai and cheung 2016b the initial static condition corresponds to a sinusoidal wave profile with a very small amplitude of a h 1 4000 to minimize nonlinear effects zero surface elevation is imposed at the open boundaries to restrain the node locations and thus the length of the standing waves the period of the subsequent oscillation is defined by the dispersion property of the numerical model depending on the spatial and temporal discretizations a numerical gauge at the center of the numerical flume records the surface elevation time series which provides the wave period for computation of the celerity from the prescribed wavelength adjustment of the water depth time step and grid size allows comparison of the model results with the dispersion relation 38 in terms of the parameters kh kδx and cr fig 5a shows the celerity as a function of kδx for kh up to 0 6 and a small cr 0 1 the numerical model and the dispersion relation give almost identical results at kh 0 which correspond to the hydrostatic conditions the discrepancy increases slightly with kδx for kh 0 when the implicit solution of the non hydrostatic pressure is involved the computational errors however are very small comparing to the discretization errors in defining dispersion properties in the numerical model also included in the comparison is the lead order approximation 42 which is practically identical to the dispersion relation 38 for kδx 0 3 independent of kh as the accuracy is to second order minor discrepancies develop at large values of kδx that are less relevant for numerical modeling fig 5b shows the celerity as a function of cr while minimizing the spatial discretization errors by setting kδx 0 1 because of the small values of kδx the celerity is not very sensitive to cr see fig 2a the good agreement between the model and analytical results over the full range of cr confirms that the time step plays a secondary role in the implicit solution of the non hydrostatic pressure 5 2 progressive waves in a basin we utilize a second set of numerical experiments to illustrate manifestation of spatial discretization errors in wave propagation and anisotropy of wave dispersion over a two dimensional cartesian grid the numerical experiments involve a square domain with initial conditions defined by a gaussian hump at the center 48 ζ r ae r 2 b 4 2 where r is radial distance a is the amplitude and b is effectively the diameter at the still water level the hump which contains a range of spatial harmonics is analogous to the static initial conditions commonly used for tsunami modeling the resulting waves propagate radially from the center with celerity and period determined by the model dispersion property although the physical problem is axisymmetric the numerical solution depends on the wave direction relative to the principal axis the effects of the courant number are secondary and independent of the wave direction we utilize a small cr 0 01 to focus on the spatial discretization which dominates numerical dispersion the domain has uniform water depth with grid size parameters of γ 0 8 2 and 4 to illustrate hydrostatic and non hydrostatic modeling of long wave propagation from optimal to suboptimal conditions a small wave amplitude of a h 1 4000 ensures linearity for evaluation and interpretation of the model results in relation to the dispersion relation 38 the first series of tests utilizes an effective diameter of b h 30 for the gaussian hump that the dominant harmonic is within the shallow water range fig 6a plots the time series and spectra at x h 375 along the axis the non hydrostatic solution with γ 0 8 which closely follows the dispersion relation from airy wave theory up to kh 1 2 provides a reference for comparison the waveform shows a distinct crest and trough profile in the form of an n wave followed by dispersive waves with decreasing amplitude and period associated with the higher harmonics in the initial conditions the amplitude spectrum has the peak at kh 0 17 and tapers off at kh 0 77 the hydrostatic solution shows a typical crest and trough profile with a larger amplitude and a longer peak period the low numerical dispersion in the shallow water range also leads to a more impulsive crest with the peak shewed forward the non hydrostatic solution continues to provide a reasonable description for the main wave component at γ 2 albeit with a slight increase in the amplitude and period of the trailing waves the hydrostatic solution shows reduced skewness of the leading crest as well as lagging of short period components with increased numerical dispersion at γ 4 the non hydrostatic solution overestimates dispersion with noticeable transfer of energy from the leading to the trailing waves the hydrostatic solution closely matches the dispersion relation of airy wave theory up to kh 0 6 and produces very similar results as the non hydrostatic solution with γ 0 8 as shown in fig 6b the second series of tests utilizes an effective diameter of b h 15 for the gaussian hump with the dominant harmonic outside the shallow water range fig 7a plots the time series and spectra at x h 375 for the non hydrostatic solution with γ 0 8 the time series shows a wave train with decreasing amplitude and period typical of a dispersive system the spectrum has a peak at kh 0 44 with energy up to kh 0 96 inside the range of accurate model dispersion the hydrostatic solution produces a distinct initial crest and trough profile followed by short period waves since the initial conditions defines the spectral components spatially in terms of the wavelength the overestimated celerity as shown in fig 4a leads to underestimation of the wave period dispersion is instrumental in eliminating these short period artifacts commonly seen in hydrostatic modeling of tsunamis bai and cheung 2016a li et al 2016a b the non hydrostatic solution still resolves the initial wave accurately with γ 2 but the slightly underestimated celerity with increasing kh results in transfer of more energy to the trailing waves the increased numerical dispersion in the hydrostatic model produces a less impulsive initial crest and longer trailing waves with an improved description of amplitude attenuation at γ 4 the excess dispersion in the non hydrostatic model leads to shifting of the largest peak to the second wave the hydrostatic model resolves dispersion in the shallow water range and as illustrated in fig 7b reproduces the longer period initial waves from the non hydrostatic solution with γ 0 8 the short period trailing waves which are outside the range of numerical dispersion are slowly attenuating on the fringe of numerical noise the numerical results have demonstrated the reduced influence of discretization when intrinsic dispersion is present in the model this is evident in the subtle variation of the non hydrostatic solution versus the transformation of the hydrostatic solution from non dispersive to weakly dispersive over the range of γ from 0 8 to 4 we utilize the test with b h 15 and γ 2 that involves suboptimal numerical dispersion in both the hydrostatic and non hydrostatic models to examine manifestation of discretization errors in oblique propagation directions and the concept of effective grid spacing as suggested in the lead order dispersion relation 42 fig 8 plots the time series and spectra at r h 375 for wave directions of 0 22 5 and 45 relative to the x axis numerical dispersion attenuates with wave obliquity in both the hydrostatic and non hydrostatic solutions but the effects are more significant in the former due to the absence of intrinsic dispersion as demonstrated by the increasing leading wave amplitude the parameter β decreases from 1 to 3 4 as the wave direction turns from the x axis to 22 5 and reaches the minimum at 1 2 for propagation along the grid diagonal the results at 22 5 and 45 corroborate those along the x axis from a separate set of tests using reduced grid size parameters of k β δ x with β 3 4 and 1 2 the minor discrepancies are due to interpolation of the surface elevation from adjacent grid points the use of effective grid spacing provides an intuitive assessment of numerical dispersion in practical application 6 case study the 2011 mw 9 1 tohoku earthquake ruptured the megathrust off northeastern japan with strong shaking and a destructive tsunami across the region hayes 2011 mori et al 2011 the event produced unprecedented geophysical and hydrographic datasets for development of a range of earthquake and tsunami source models to understand the mechanisms and impacts lay 2018 the tsunami and p wave constrained model tp mod of yamazaki et al 2018 consistently reproduces the global seismic and regional geodetic records through a finer scale moment and rake constrained inversion as well as wave runup along 2000 km of east japan coasts near field waveforms at 18 buoys surrounding the tsunami source and far field waveforms from 26 dart stations across the north and south pacific using neowave the pacific ocean has an average depth of 4000 m while having a general range of 2000 to 6000 m associated with large scale seafloor features such as basins and rises their grid size of 2 arcmin and the average depth of the pacific give γ 0 8 which produces optimal performance for wave dispersion in the open ocean the value of γ ranges from 0 4 to 3 2 over large scale seafloor features but the effective grid size for oblique wave directions and the decreasing grid spacing with latitude reduce the actual value of γ and the level of undesirable numerical dispersion in the non hydrostatic solution the good agreement over extended durations between the computed and recorded tsunami waveforms at locations as far as the chile coasts indicates accurate reproduction of the seafloor deformation at the tsunami source as well as the propagation processes across 16 000 km of the ocean we utilize tp mod to define the seafloor deformation for modeling of the 2011 tohoku tsunami across the north pacific using neowave the model input and setting from yamazaki et al 2018 provide the basis for a grid sensitivity analysis in hydrostatic and non hydrostatic computations of tsunami waves with varying bathymetry fig 9a shows the fault slip distribution and seafloor displacement at the end of the 2 5 min rupture the dislocation extends 240 km along dip and 400 km along strike with average slip reaching 22 and 37 m at subfaults near the epicenter and trench implementation of the planar fault solution of okada 1985 provides the time history of seafloor vertical displacement which in turn is augmented by horizontal displacement on local slopes tanioka and satake 1996 for modeling of tsunami generation via the non hydrostatic terms in neowave the final deformation with up to 2 m of subsidence near the coast 9 m of uplift adjacent to the epicenter and 7 and 33 m of vertical and horizontal displacements near the trench is consistent with the geodetic records from iinuma et al 2012 and ito et al 2011 both the hydrostatic and non hydrostatic computations of the tsunami utilize 1 2 and 5 arcmin grid spacing to examine sensitivity of numerical dispersion across the pacific a two way nested 1 arcmin grid is implemented over the source region within the 2 and 5 arcmin grids as shown in fig 9b for the hydrostatic modeling the vertical velocity term is disabled after the tsunami is generated and the resulting nonlinear shallow water equations are integrated with the semi implicit scheme for the rest of the computation the use of the same tsunami generation mechanism and near field resolution in the hydrostatic and non hydrostatic modeling allows direct comparison of the results to quantify dispersion effects from trans oceanic propagation figs 10 and 11 compare the non hydrostatic and hydrostatic solutions at 6 and 8 h after the earthquake as the tsunami passes through the western and major hawaiian islands the dominant 45 60 and 90 min components associated with the overall slip near the epicenter and trench are in the shallow water range across the pacific yamazaki et al 2018 but effects of dispersion or the lack of it are seen from the source to the wave front the non hydrostatic model with the 2 arcmin grid which at γ 0 8 has the optimal combination of intrinsic and numerical dispersion over a wide kh range fig 4b provides a reference for comparison the modeled waves show decreasing amplitude and period behind the leading crest the many seamounts and atolls in the western and central pacific produce prominent scattering of the trailing waves due to their shorter wavelengths associated with the detailed slip pattern the hydrostatic model at the same resolution underestimates dispersion even in the shallow water range fig 4a this results in a larger and more impulsive leading crest crisscrossed and followed by notably shorter waves in contrast to the non hydrostatic solution scattering of the trailing waves generates signals with less than 3 min period due to more pronounced nonlinear effects the artifacts are most evident along the emperor seamounts and the hawaiian islands obscuring the tsunami wave patterns the hydrostatic solution from the 5 arcmin grid can reproduce dispersion around the shallow water range with γ 4 fig 4a the amplitude and timing of the dominant components near the wave front compare reasonably well with the non hydrostatic solution but the short period artifacts remains in the trailing wave system due to the limited range of dispersion through numerical discretization alone dispersion plays a significant role in the overall amplitude and phase of trans oceanic tsunamis that have significant implications for geophysical research hazard assessment warning guidance and engineering design fig 12 plots the reference wave amplitude from the 2 arcmin non hydrostatic computation as well as the amplitude difference from those obtained using grid sizes of 1 to 5 arcmin with and without intrinsic dispersion the reference wave amplitude shows multiple energy lobes radiating from the source off the tohoku coast across the north pacific the non hydrostatic solution at finer grid spacing of 1 arcmin involves an 8 fold increase of the computing time but exhibits negligible differences from the reference amplitude as intrinsic dispersion in the governing equations is sufficient to describe the propagation processes and numerical dispersion is small for the grid spacing increasing the grid size to 5 arcmin overshoots numerical dispersion resulting in moderate reduction of wave amplitude primarily along the main energy lobes switching the non hydrostatic terms off reduces the computing time by a factor of four in neowave the lack of intrinsic dispersion results in overestimation of the wave amplitude across most of the north pacific increasing the grid size enhances numerical dispersion with gradual reduction of the wave amplitude the 5 arcmin grid can generate enough dispersion around the shallow water range to account for the dominant wave components the overestimated amplitude is due to insufficient dispersion of short period waves as well as presence of high frequency artifacts trailing the leading waves the large grid size of more than two times the average water depth might not fully resolve the small islands and seamounts as most evident in the wave amplitude overestimation in the well sheltered sea of okhotsk and sea of japan tables 1 and 2 compare the computed initial peak amplitude and arrival time with observations at selected dart stations across the north pacific see fig 12 for station locations the comparison at dart 21418 which is located 550 km from the source with relatively uniform bathymetry in between provides a straightforward demonstration of dispersion as in the gaussian hump numerical experiment the non hydrostatic computations at 1 and 2 arcmin grid spacing γ 0 8 give good agreement with the observed wave amplitude through a combination of intrinsic and numerical dispersion the computed amplitude deteriorates slightly at lower resolution due to excess numerical dispersion from the spatial discretization the hydrostatic model produces the optimal amount of discretization errors at 5 arcmin γ 4 in matching the observation but overestimates the amplitude at higher resolution due to insufficient dispersion tsunami arrival time is also influenced by earth elasticity and water density variation tsai et al 2013 baba et al 2017 which are typically not included in the governing equations for free surface flow the absence of these high order physical processes leads to early arrivals in both hydrostatic and non hydrostatic modeling of trans oceanic tsunamis bai and cheung 2016a at dart 21418 the initial peak from the non hydrostatic computation arrives 1 3 min early relatively independent of the grid spacing the more impulsive initial crest from the hydrostatic solution leads to an earlier arrival of the peak as seen in the gaussian hump experiment figs 6 and 7 the skewness of the computed initial crest is large and is an important factor for the timing of the peak in the near field but is somewhat reduced by numerical dispersion when the grid spacing is increased to 5 arcmin and improved agreement of the arrival time is observed the physical processes become more complex in the far field and the wave pattern is influenced by additional factors such as refraction diffraction and reflection of the broad band components by landmasses the effects are most pronounced at dart 21415 immediately to the east of the emperor seamount chain across from the tsunami source overall the non hydrostatic model continues to produce consistent results for the peak amplitude and arrival time that demonstrate convergence of the solution at 2 arcmin or finer grid spacing the offsets from observations are due to approximation or omission of physical processes other than dispersion the hydrostatic solution maintains the general trend associated with numerical dispersion but shows variations depending on the model resolution and station location the peak arrival time is closer to the non hydrostatic prediction albeit with interference from the short period artifacts and is less sensitive to grid spacing at the far field locations as wave skewness reduces with numerical dispersion over long distance of propagation except for dart 21415 the travel time from the non hydrostatic and hydrostatic models is typically 1 and 2 shorter than the observations the 1 difference between the two approaches is due to the respective celerity of the long period leading waves the effects of intrinsic and numerical dispersion on arrival time are secondary comparing to the peak amplitude which is influenced by harmonic components outside the shallow water range the computed peak amplitude from the hydrostatic model at 1 and 2 arcmin grid spacing can be 40 larger due to phase locking but even at the optimal resolution of 5 arcmin does not necessarily approach the non hydrostatic solution in contrast to the gaussian hump experiment the use of numerical dispersion through adjustment of grid spacing in a hydrostatic model does not always provide reliable wave amplitude in real world applications 7 discussion and conclusions the fourier method is an effective and straightforward alternative to the taylor expansion in deriving dispersion relations for high order wave models through the eigenvalue of the discretized linear governing equations the present study focuses on one layer non hydrostatic flows for tsunami modeling but the approach can be readily applied to multi layer or boussinesq type models for wind generated waves the extension of the fourier method from hydrostatic to non hydrostatic models simply increases the rank of the eigenvalue matrix from three to five the eigenvalue gives rise to a stability condition for the numerical scheme as well as a combined relation for intrinsic dispersion from the continuous governing equations and numerical dispersion as a phase error associated with the grid size and time step the discretization with a staggered finite difference scheme and first order semi implicit time integration remains neutrally stable with inclusion of the non hydrostatic terms through the keller box approach the dispersion relation is independent of the implicit solution of the non hydrostatic pressure and is exact for linear wave propagation over uniform depth implementation of taylor expansions to the dispersion relation produces a lead order approximation which demonstrates the interrelationship among the depth and discretization parameters in modulating dispersion the exact and lead order dispersion relations provide insights into the interplay between intrinsic and numerical dispersion during the computation as well as a useful tool to guide selection of discretization parameters for real world applications the depth parameter kh and spatial discretization kδx have complementary effects on dispersion providing a means to optimize non hydrostatic wave models through adjustment of the grid size their coupling results in notable reduction of numerical dispersion outside the shallow water range in comparison to the hydrostatic model the temporal discretization tends to reduce numerical dispersion but the effects are secondary within the range of courant numbers used in wave modeling numerical dispersion which results primarily from truncation errors associated with the spatial discretization decreases for oblique wave propagation due to effective increase in resolution and reaches a minimum at 45 from a principal axis of the grid the intrinsic property from the continuous governing equations accounts for a significant portion of physical dispersion and reduces the effects of spatial discretization thereby improving numerical modeling of broadband wave propagation discretization errors in shallow water models can mimic the lead order dispersion term from boussinesq type systems for tsunami modeling but the required grid size might not be sufficient to resolve the many seamounts and islands across the pacific in addition the lead order dispersion does not cover the full spectrum of tsunami waves resulting in phase locking of harmonic components during propagation and high frequency noise across the ocean the wave amplitude from a hydrostatic model is influenced by these numerical artifacts and sensitive to the spatial resolution commonly used in tsunami modeling the boussinesq type equations which have accurate dispersion in the tsunami range might be adversely affected by numerical dispersion a tsunami consists of a number of harmonics related to the complexity of the seafloor bathymetry and deformation at the source the wave components with varying dispersion properties need to be captured by a computational grid spanning across the ocean the keller box scheme leads to slight underestimation of dispersion in the governing equations of the non hydrostatic model the numerical solution can be tuned with grid spacing to achieve good and consistent convergence properties the use of a 2 arcmin grid is optimal in balancing intrinsic and numerical dispersion over the varying bathymetry across the pacific ocean the use of two way nested grids with increasing resolution from the open ocean to the coast has been a standard practice in tsunami hazard mapping e g imamura et al 1988 liu et al 1995 yamazaki et al 2011b for example the resolution can span a wide range from 2 arcmin 3700 m near the equator across the pacific ocean to as fine as 5 to 10 m at the shore e g bai et al 2018a yamazaki et al 2018 the primary purpose of grid refinement is to more precisely capture shelf and coastal features which play an important role in wave amplification and coastal inundation although the present study focuses on trans oceanic tsunami propagation the dispersion relation can provide guidance for grid refinement across shelf breaks the governing equations of the non hydrostatic model can describe dispersion within the tsunami range reasonably well the numerical means only serves as a secondary and convenient measure to refine the wave propagation property there exists an optimal grid size to water depth ratio but it is not necessary to keep refining the grid toward the shore because physical dispersion vanishes in the sheet flow as the water depth parameter kh 0 and numerical dispersion is negligible within the range of kδx commonly used for inundation modeling acknowledgments the authors received support from the national tsunami hazard mitigation

taylor method to analyze the semi implicit time integration used in neowave of yamazaki et al 2009 2011b for a direct comparison with the truncation properties in the leap frog scheme considering one

ζ i m δ t h u i 1 2 m 1 u i 1 2 m 1 δ x 0 where m denotes the current time step and i is an index at the cell center the staggered finite difference scheme introduces second order spatial discretization errors in the flow velocity and surface elevation the first order time integration is explicit for the flow velocity in the momentum equation a 1 and implicit for the surface elevation

24034,numerical discretization with a finite difference scheme is known to introduce frequency dispersion in depth integrated long wave models commonly used in tsunami research and hazard mapping while prior studies on numerical dispersion focused on the linear shallow water equations we include the non hydrostatic pressure and vertical velocity through a keller box scheme and investigate the properties of the resulting system in relation to a hydrostatic model fourier analysis of the discretized governing equations gives rise to a dispersion relation in terms of the water depth parameter as well as the time step grid size and wave direction the dispersion relation is illustrated by its lead order approximation derived from taylor series expansions as well as numerical experiments involving standing and progressive waves with uniform water depth interaction between the spatial discretization and non hydrostatic terms leads to significant reduction of numerical dispersion outside the shallow water range numerical dispersion also decreases for wave propagation oblique to the computational grid due to effective increase in spatial resolution the time step which counteracts numerical dispersion from spatial discretization only has secondary effects within the applicable range of courant numbers since the governing equations of the non hydrostatic model derived from the keller box scheme tend to underestimate dispersion in shoaling water the numerical effects are complementary in producing a solution closer to airy wave theory a case study of the

wide range of water depth parameters across the ocean keywords numerical dispersion non hydrostatic models long wave propagation staggered finite difference scheme shallow water equations keller box scheme 1 introduction numerical long wave models have been an essential tool for tsunami research and hazard mapping conventional finite difference models based on the nonlinear shallow water equations are the primary choice due to their simple numerical frameworks low computing costs and ease of implementation e g imamura et al 1988 kowalik and bang 1987 liu et al 1995 titov and synolakis 1998 the hydrostatic governing equations describe wave propagation through the shallow water celerity independent of the wave period recent advances in sensor technology have enabled detection of intricate dispersive wave systems even in large catastrophic tsunamis hanson and bowman 2005 and kulikov 2006 deduced separation of wave components by period in hydrophone and altimetry records of the 2004 indian ocean tsunami saito et al 2010 and yamazaki et al 2011a identified strong frequency dispersion in ocean bottom pressure records of the 2010 chile and 2011 tohoku tsunamis the observations show lagging of short period components as tsunamis propagate across the ocean near the coast acoustic doppler current profiler adcp records have suggested these trailing tsunami waves are the primary energy source for persistent surges and strong currents in insular shelf and reef environments bricker et al 2007 cheung et al 2013 yamazaki et al 2012a dispersion is typically regarded as a high order property of tsunami waves but its influence on the amplitude and phase adds up across the ocean with significant contributions to the waveform researchers have been exploring the use of numerical means in shallow water models as well as high order properties in boussinesq type or non hydrostatic models to account for frequency dispersion during tsunami propagation discretization of hyperbolic differential equations introduces truncation errors that manifest as dispersion and dissipation in the solution the taylor series expansion which allows detailed step by step analysis of discretization errors is a classical approach to characterize the property of these numerical artifacts abbott et al 1984 warming and hyett 1974 trans oceanic propagation of tsunamis is primarily a linear process because the wave amplitude is small compared to the water depth imamura et al 1988 analyzed the staggered finite difference scheme with leap frog time integration for the linear shallow water equations and showed the grid size and time step can be adjusted to match the lead order term of the dispersion relation from the boussinesq type equations of peregrine 1967 this approach can numerically describe wave dispersion over a range of water depth parameters around shallow water shuto 1991 and burwell et al 2007 showed the lead order approximation can be maintained in varying water depth through adjustment of the grid size for modeling of one dimensional long wave propagation cho 1995 extended the method to two dimensions by including corrections in the discretized shallow water equations to mimic the cross derivative dispersion terms in the boussinesq type equations instead of adjusting the grid size locally cho et al 2007 and ha and cho 2015 introduced variable coefficients in the correction terms to accommodate variation of water depth yoon 2002 proposed a variant of the approach by employing a hidden grid in the discretized governing equations with resolution tuned to mimic the lead order dispersion property at the local water depth wang and liu 2011 adopted this approach to manipulate numerical dispersion for weakly nonlinear and weakly dispersive waves propagating over slowly varying water depth with a shallow water model more advanced depth integrated models can describe dispersion mathematically over a wide range of water depth parameters through the governing equations one approach is to include high order terms in the nonlinear shallow water equations through a taylor series expansion of the dispersion relation from airy wave theory peregrine 1967 this gives rise to the boussinesq type equations of varying complexity commonly used in modeling of wind generated waves e g madsen et al 1991 nwogu 1993 wei and kirby 1995 gobbi et al 2000 boussinesq type models have also been implemented to account for dispersion in trans oceanic tsunami propagation e g horrillo et al 2006 kirby et al 2013 saito et al 2014 baba et al 2017 an alternate approach to describe dispersive waves is to directly include the non hydrostatic pressure and vertical velocity through the keller box scheme without increasing the order of the governing equations stelling and zijlema 2003 while a one layer model is sufficient for tsunami modeling yamazaki et al 2009 additional layers instead of higher order derivatives are used to improve linear and nonlinear properties for modeling of wind generated waves e g zijlema et al 2011 bai and cheung 2013 smit et al 2014 the relatively simple numerical framework allows implementation of a two way grid nesting scheme for modeling of tsunamis from trans oceanic propagation to coastal runup e g yamazaki et al 2011b bai et al 2018a the vertical velocity also facilitates modeling of kinematic seafloor deformation to provide a more complete account of tsunami generation and the near field wave dynamics for inference of earthquake rupture processes e g yamazaki et al 2011a 2018 lay et al 2013 lay et al 2013 li et al 2016b bai et al 2018b the governing equations of boussinesq type and non hydrostatic models can account for dispersion to varying degree of accuracy in relation to the exact solution from airy wave theory while the dispersion relation of the boussinesq type equations converges asymptotically at the shallow water limit the low order depth integration accompanying the keller box scheme in the non hydrostatic approach leads to slight underestimation of dispersion in shoaling water bai et al 2018c this is complicated by the discretization scheme which introduces truncation errors associated with the time step and grid size that interfere with the dispersion property intrinsic to the governing equations furthermore the intrinsic property itself is a mathematical approximation of the exact solution understanding of the numerical and intrinsic properties is crucial for selection of computational grids that can most appropriately account for physical dispersion and make efficient use of computing resources however the truncation error analysis based on the taylor series expansion becomes very cumbersome with the high order derivatives in the boussinesq type equations vitousek and fringer 2011 decoupled the intrinsic and numerical dispersion by assuming the water depth parameter is small and examined how superposition of numerical dispersion from a shallow water model to the intrinsic properties of the one dimensional boussinesq type and kdv equations would modify internal wave propagation as the dispersion properties from those governing equations are highly accurate around shallow water the discretization errors inevitably lead to overestimation of dispersion in the numerical solution baba et al 2017 pointed out the need to use a very small grid size to suppress numerical dispersion in a boussinesq type model for computation of tsunami propagation numerical dispersion is present regardless of the governing equations as along as a finite grid size is used in the computation however the discretization errors can potentially alleviate the underestimation of dispersion by the governing equations of depth integrated non hydrostatic models the one layer formulation which provides the basic building block for multilayer models serves as a proxy for examination of numerical dispersion in the non hydrostatic approach in this study the non hydrostatic system of linear governing equations is discretized with a staggered finite difference scheme in the two dimensional horizontal plane and the keller box approach in the vertical direction the non hydrostatic terms involving the pressure and vertical velocity present a challenge in the taylor series expansion even though the governing equations remain at first order the truncation error in the non hydrostatic pressure is dependent on other variables effectively introducing high order terms through recursive operations numerical dispersion is not directly additive to the intrinsic property of the non hydrostatic system as demonstrated in the comparative model study of li et al 2016a and their interaction remains a topic for investigation the fourier method provides a straightforward procedure to derive the dispersion relation without expanding the high order and cross derivative terms as would be the case in the taylor approach with the dispersion relation expressed in terms of the discretization parameters and aided by numerical experiments and a case study we explore the coupling between intrinsic and numerical dispersion the anisotropic propagation property over a two dimensional computation grid the use of numerical dispersion to offset errors intrinsic to the governing equations and the manifestation of numerical dispersion in hydrostatic and non hydrostatic modeling of tsunamis across the ocean with varying bathymetry 2 governing equations the non hydrostatic free surface flow is defined by a cartesian coordinate system x y z with the x and y axes in the horizontal plane and the positive z axis pointing upward from the still water level let g denote the acceleration due to gravity h the

with the non hydrostatic pressure terms in the horizontal momentum equations 1 and 2 and the addition of the vertical momentum equation 3 the continuity equation 4 remains the same as in the shallow water equations to ensure conservation of mass the keller box scheme in stelling and zijlema 2003 defines the variables at the free surface and seabed in deriving the horizontal momentum equations 1

for the flow velocity in the horizontal momentum equations 15 and 16 and implicit for the surface elevation in the continuity equation 18 the use of the horizontal velocity at m 1 in the time integration of the surface elevation introduces second order truncation properties identical to the commonly used leap frog scheme see appendix a while the spatial derivatives are approximated by second order central differences the semi implicit time integration stabilizes the computation kowalik and murty 1993 the leapfrog scheme which is explicit and second order can alternatively pair with the second order spatial discretization to integrate the solution in time with the same order of accuracy imamura et al 1988 liu et al 1995 zijlema et al 2011 smit et al 2014 the non hydrostatic

implicit solution for the non hydrostatic pressure q at m 1 the velocity u v w is then updated from integration of the non hydrostatic terms in the momentum equations 15 17 and ζ from the continuity equation 18 before proceeding to the next time step 3 fourier and taylor expansions the fourier expansion which has been a standard approach in deriving dispersion relations for governing equations of free surface flow is implemented here to study the propagation property of the non hydrostatic model formulated in section 2 the discretization transforms the governing differential equations into a system of algebraic equations which must be satisfied by each frequency component in the expansion the resulting eigenvalue matrix links the wave frequency and number as well as the discretization parameters in a dispersion relation this analytical technique has also been used to study numerical dispersion and stability in shallow water models e g leendertse 1967 foreman 1984 sankaranarayanan and spaulding 2003 its extension to the non hydrostatic system involves two additional variables with the rank of the eigen value matrix increased by two the resulting dispersion relation expressed in

second order see appendix a substitution of δx 2 γh 2 ghδt 2 yields 46 c gh 1 γ 12 kh 2 1 2 where kh is reintroduced into the dispersion relation of the hydrostatic model to account for depth dependence of discretization errors imamura et al 1988 showed a value of γ 4 gives rise to 47 c gh 1 1 3 kh 2 1 2 which is the lead order expansion of the dispersion relation from the boussinesq type equations of peregrine 1967 a value of γ 3 results in a coefficient of 1 4 for the depth parameter providing a lead order approximation to the intrinsic dispersion relation 44 of the non hydrostatic system the propagation property from the governing equations boils down to the coefficient in the intrinsic dispersion relation the boussinesq type approach yields a coefficient of 1 3 with accurate results around the shallow water range and asymptotic convergence to airy wave theory at kh 0 the coefficient 1 4 which results from the linear non hydrostatic pressure profile in the depth integration 5 leads to slight underestimation of dispersion in shoaling water but better agreement with airy wave theory toward deep water bai et al 2018c an assumption of a quadratic profile for the non hydrostatic pressure can produce a coefficient of 1 3 equivalent to the boussinesq type equations jeschke et al 2017 discretization errors however are always present in the numerical solution even with an accurate account of dispersion from the governing equations a small grid size can help alleviate the numerical artifacts but will increase the computing cost and limit the model application the slightly weaker dispersion intrinsic in the governing equations of the non hydrostatic model provides an opportunity to accommodate discretization errors in matching the numerical solution with airy wave theory 4 2 inter relationship among parameters the lead order dispersion relation 42 shows the intrinsic property from the governing equations and its influence on the numerical contribution in separate terms the underlying expansion stands out the role of each parameter and its inter relationship with the others the water depth parameter kh lowers the celerity through intrinsic dispersion and interacts with the spatial and temporal discretizations to modulate the numerical property while the upper bound of the grid size parameter kδx is π the practical maximum is around one for resolution of a wavelength with at least six computational cells such that the denominator of the numerical dispersion term is always positive the wave direction parameter β has a range of 0 5 to 1 0 and the courant number cr must be less than 1 2 for wave propagation over a two dimensional grid the positive numerator indicates the primary role of the temporal discretization in increasing the celerity while reducing numerical dispersion in contrast the parameter kδx facilitates reduction of the celerity through the numerator and denominator of the numerical dispersion term the complementary effects of kh and kδx provide the basis for the use of spatial discretization errors to mimic dispersion in numerical wave models it is important to note that the presence of kh in the denominator indicates reduction of discretization errors with increasing water depth or intrinsic dispersion the exact dispersion relation 38 describes the celerity without assuming small values of the discretization parameters to aid interpretation of the property over the full range fig 2a plots the celerity over kδx and cr with the propagation direction along the x axis the depth parameter kh from 0 to 0 6 is most relevant to tsunami modeling bai and cheung 2016a the celerity decreases and dispersion increases with kh and kδx but vice versa with cr the courant number plays a secondary role in counteracting numerical dispersion because its coupling with kδx results in a combined fourth order term as shown in the lead order approximation 42 oblique wave propagation also reduces numerical dispersion fig 2b demonstrates the increased celerity with an oblique wave direction of 45 from the x axis the lead order dispersion relation 42 can provide an insight into the mechanism the parameter β can be incorporated into the discretization parameter as k β δ x to denote an effective grid size in the direction of wave propagation since β 1 the decrease in effective grid spacing reduces numerical dispersion for oblique wave propagation turning the waves to 45 with β 1 2 has the same effects on the celerity as a reduction of the grid size by a factor of 1 2 as illustrated geometrically in fig 1 the results also show increased influence of cr at the smaller value of β 0 5 as indicated in the lead order dispersion relation it is useful to investigate the interplay between intrinsic and numerical dispersion in matching airy wave theory we consider waves propagating along the x axis for illustration the concept of effective grid spacing can be applied to infer numerical dispersion for oblique wave directions fig 3 plots the celerity from the dispersion relation 38 normalized by the exact solution from airy wave theory over kδx and cr the celerity reduction or numerical dispersion is most prominent in the absence of intrinsic dispersion at kh 0 the governing equations of the hydrostatic and non hydrostatic models give higher predictions of the celerity in relation to airy wave theory when kh 0 numerical dispersion can offset the overestimation in matching the exact solution through a combination of spatial and temporal discretization errors the effects however are relatively mild and insensitive at small values of kδx the hydrostatic model requires a grid size of kδx 0 6 to achieve the correct dispersion property outside the shallow water range a slightly larger grid size is needed to counter the effects of temporal discretization within the applicable range of kδx numerical dispersion alone is not sufficient to match airy wave theory above kh 0 5 inclusion of the non hydrostatic terms in the governing equations alleviates this requirement and enables achievement of proper dispersion within the range of kδx for accurate resolution of tsunami waves 4 3 convergence with grid size and water depth a tsunami consists of a range of harmonics associated with the bathymetry at the source and the seafloor deformation from earthquake rupture recent advances in imaging techniques using combinations of global seismic waves region gps observations near field tsunami waveforms and coastal runup measurements have led to development of detailed source models for inference of earthquake rupture processes lay 2018 these source models involve complex patterns of heterogeneous slip and seafloor deformation with multiple length scales since the initial harmonics of a tsunami are defined spatially in terms of their wavelengths at the source dispersion is key to reproduction of the wave periods across the ocean as well as the subsequent resonance and impact near the coast it is therefore important for a numerical model to match the dispersion relation from airy wave theory over an appropriate range of water depth parameters beyond shallow water for practical applications the hydrostatic model in which numerical dispersion has been extensively studied provides a baseline for comparison fig 4a plots the normalized celerity from the dispersion relation 39 as a function of kh reintroduced by substitution of δx 2 γh 2 ghδt 2 since the time step size plays a secondary role in numerical dispersion we assign a small value of cr 0 01 to focus on the effects of spatial discretization with δt 0 the combined grid size and depth parameter γ δx h 2 relates the numerical component of the model celerity versus the intrinsic component from the governing equations in defining the propagation property across the ocean the results illustrate strong dependence of numerical dispersion on γ and kh at γ 0 the lack of dispersion in the shallow water equations results in substantial overestimation of the celerity with increasing kh increasing the value of γ leads to numerical dispersion that in turn reduces the celerity a value of γ 4 which reproduces the lead order term of the dispersion relation from the boussinesq type equations of peregrine 1967 provides a very good approximation of the celerity from airy wave theory around shallow water the results show a 0 53 error at kh 0 6 around the upper bound of the tsunami range the celerity is quite sensitive to γ especially outside shallow water through local adjustment of the grid size with water depth wang and liu 2011 managed to mimic the lead order dispersion property over varying bathymetry by maintaining γ 4 using a hydrostatic model the discretization errors can similarly be tuned to augment the dispersion relation 38 of the non hydrostatic model for improved wave propagation characteristics as shown in fig 4b a large value of γ 4 results in excess numerical dispersion leading to underestimation of the celerity even within the shallow water range reducing γ leads to increase of the celerity but at a lower rate over a smaller range comparing to the hydrostatic model results in fig 4a in comparison to airy wave theory the intrinsic dispersion relation at γ 0 slightly underestimates dispersion for kh 2 4 a value of γ 0 8 introduces the right amount of numerical dispersion to offset the underestimation and reproduces the celerity up to kh 0 6 and 1 2 with less than 0 13 and 0 77 error comparing to airy wave theory the resulting dispersion relation follows closely the boussineq type equations of peregrine 1967 for tsunami modeling and has slightly better performance over most of the intermediate depth range tuning of numerical dispersion in the non hydrostatic model might provide a computationally efficient alternative instead of additional layers for modeling of surf zone processes involving wind generated waves the governing equations account for a significant portion of physical dispersion and reduce the effects of spatial discretization with increasing kh numerical dispersion also becomes less sensitive to γ when compared to the hydrostatic model results the optimal grid size parameter of γ 0 8 can provide an accurate description of broad band tsunami waves over varying bathymetry 5 numerical experiments the validity and interpretation of the dispersion relation 38 are illustrated through a series of numerical experiments using the hydrostatic and non hydrostatic modes of neowave yamazaki et al 2009 2011b which is based on the staggered finite difference keller box and semi implicit time integration schemes described in section 2 neowave has been validated with the laboratory and field benchmarks of the national tsunami hazard mitigation program for hazard mapping and assessment yamazaki et al 2012b bai et al 2015 the use of a single computer code in this comparative study allows examination of the hydrostatic and non hydrostatic results from the same model input and setting for the subtle difference in numerical dispersion associated with grid spacing we first consider standing waves in a flume to examine computational errors from the implicit solution of the non hydrostatic pressure and then illustrate effects of numerical dispersion in modeling of progressive waves on water of uniform depth 5 1 standing waves in a flume the dispersion relation 38 of the non hydrostatic model is independent of the implicit solution of the pressure poisson equation 20 the effects of the solution scheme and its computational errors on dispersion are examined through a one dimensional numerical experiment dispersion in a numerical model can be evaluated from regular standing waves of a given length in a flume of uniform depth bai and cheung 2016b the initial static condition corresponds to a sinusoidal wave profile with a very small amplitude of a h 1 4000 to minimize nonlinear effects zero surface elevation is imposed at the open boundaries to restrain the node locations and thus the length of the standing waves the period of the subsequent oscillation is defined by the dispersion property of the numerical model depending on the spatial and temporal discretizations a numerical gauge at the center of the numerical flume records the surface elevation time series which provides the wave period for computation of the celerity from the prescribed wavelength adjustment of the water depth time step and grid size allows comparison of the model results with the dispersion relation 38 in terms of the parameters kh kδx and cr fig 5a shows the celerity as a function of kδx for kh up to 0 6 and a small cr 0 1 the numerical model and the dispersion relation give almost identical results at kh 0 which correspond to the hydrostatic conditions the discrepancy increases slightly with kδx for kh 0 when the implicit solution of the non hydrostatic pressure is involved the computational errors however are very small comparing to the discretization errors in defining dispersion properties in the numerical model also included in the comparison is the lead order approximation 42 which is practically identical to the dispersion relation 38 for kδx 0 3 independent of kh as the accuracy is to second order minor discrepancies develop at large values of kδx that are less relevant for numerical modeling fig 5b shows the celerity as a function of cr while minimizing the spatial discretization errors by setting kδx 0 1 because of the small values of kδx the celerity is not very sensitive to cr see fig 2a the good agreement between the model and analytical results over the full range of cr confirms that the time step plays a secondary role in the implicit solution of the non hydrostatic pressure 5 2 progressive waves in a basin we utilize a second set of numerical experiments to illustrate manifestation of spatial discretization errors in wave propagation and anisotropy of wave dispersion over a two dimensional cartesian grid the numerical experiments involve a square domain with initial conditions defined by a gaussian hump at the center 48 ζ r ae r 2 b 4 2 where r is radial distance a is the amplitude and b is effectively the diameter at the still water level the hump which contains a range of spatial harmonics is analogous to the static initial conditions commonly used for tsunami modeling the resulting waves propagate radially from the center with celerity and period determined by the model dispersion property although the physical problem is axisymmetric the numerical solution depends on the wave direction relative to the principal axis the effects of the courant number are secondary and independent of the wave direction we utilize a small cr 0 01 to focus on the spatial discretization which dominates numerical dispersion the domain has uniform water depth with grid size parameters of γ 0 8 2 and 4 to illustrate hydrostatic and non hydrostatic modeling of long wave propagation from optimal to suboptimal conditions a small wave amplitude of a h 1 4000 ensures linearity for evaluation and interpretation of the model results in relation to the dispersion relation 38 the first series of tests utilizes an effective diameter of b h 30 for the gaussian hump that the dominant harmonic is within the shallow water range fig 6a plots the time series and spectra at x h 375 along the axis the non hydrostatic solution with γ 0 8 which closely follows the dispersion relation from airy wave theory up to kh 1 2 provides a reference for comparison the waveform shows a distinct crest and trough profile in the form of an n wave followed by dispersive waves with decreasing amplitude and period associated with the higher harmonics in the initial conditions the amplitude spectrum has the peak at kh 0 17 and tapers off at kh 0 77 the hydrostatic solution shows a typical crest and trough profile with a larger amplitude and a longer peak period the low numerical dispersion in the shallow water range also leads to a more impulsive crest with the peak shewed forward the non hydrostatic solution continues to provide a reasonable description for the main wave component at γ 2 albeit with a slight increase in the amplitude and period of the trailing waves the hydrostatic solution shows reduced skewness of the leading crest as well as lagging of short period components with increased numerical dispersion at γ 4 the non hydrostatic solution overestimates dispersion with noticeable transfer of energy from the leading to the trailing waves the hydrostatic solution closely matches the dispersion relation of airy wave theory up to kh 0 6 and produces very similar results as the non hydrostatic solution with γ 0 8 as shown in fig 6b the second series of tests utilizes an effective diameter of b h 15 for the gaussian hump with the dominant harmonic outside the shallow water range fig 7a plots the time series and spectra at x h 375 for the non hydrostatic solution with γ 0 8 the time series shows a wave train with decreasing amplitude and period typical of a dispersive system the spectrum has a peak at kh 0 44 with energy up to kh 0 96 inside the range of accurate model dispersion the hydrostatic solution produces a distinct initial crest and trough profile followed by short period waves since the initial conditions defines the spectral components spatially in terms of the wavelength the overestimated celerity as shown in fig 4a leads to underestimation of the wave period dispersion is instrumental in eliminating these short period artifacts commonly seen in hydrostatic modeling of tsunamis bai and cheung 2016a li et al 2016a b the non hydrostatic solution still resolves the initial wave accurately with γ 2 but the slightly underestimated celerity with increasing kh results in transfer of more energy to the trailing waves the increased numerical dispersion in the hydrostatic model produces a less impulsive initial crest and longer trailing waves with an improved description of amplitude attenuation at γ 4 the excess dispersion in the non hydrostatic model leads to shifting of the largest peak to the second wave the hydrostatic model resolves dispersion in the shallow water range and as illustrated in fig 7b reproduces the longer period initial waves from the non hydrostatic solution with γ 0 8 the short period trailing waves which are outside the range of numerical dispersion are slowly attenuating on the fringe of numerical noise the numerical results have demonstrated the reduced influence of discretization when intrinsic dispersion is present in the model this is evident in the subtle variation of the non hydrostatic solution versus the transformation of the hydrostatic solution from non dispersive to weakly dispersive over the range of γ from 0 8 to 4 we utilize the test with b h 15 and γ 2 that involves suboptimal numerical dispersion in both the hydrostatic and non hydrostatic models to examine manifestation of discretization errors in oblique propagation directions and the concept of effective grid spacing as suggested in the lead order dispersion relation 42 fig 8 plots the time series and spectra at r h 375 for wave directions of 0 22 5 and 45 relative to the x axis numerical dispersion attenuates with wave obliquity in both the hydrostatic and non hydrostatic solutions but the effects are more significant in the former due to the absence of intrinsic dispersion as demonstrated by the increasing leading wave amplitude the parameter β decreases from 1 to 3 4 as the wave direction turns from the x axis to 22 5 and reaches the minimum at 1 2 for propagation along the grid diagonal the results at 22 5 and 45 corroborate those along the x axis from a separate set of tests using reduced grid size parameters of k β δ x with β 3 4 and 1 2 the minor discrepancies are due to interpolation of the surface elevation from adjacent grid points the use of effective grid spacing provides an intuitive assessment of numerical dispersion in practical application 6 case study the 2011 mw 9 1 tohoku earthquake ruptured the megathrust off northeastern japan with strong shaking and a destructive tsunami across the region hayes 2011 mori et al 2011 the event produced unprecedented geophysical and hydrographic datasets for development of a range of earthquake and tsunami source models to understand the mechanisms and impacts lay 2018 the tsunami and p wave constrained model tp mod of yamazaki et al 2018 consistently reproduces the global seismic and regional geodetic records through a finer scale moment and rake constrained inversion as well as wave runup along 2000 km of east japan coasts near field waveforms at 18 buoys surrounding the tsunami source and far field waveforms from 26 dart stations across the north and south pacific using neowave the pacific ocean has an average depth of 4000 m while having a general range of 2000 to 6000 m associated with large scale seafloor features such as basins and rises their grid size of 2 arcmin and the average depth of the pacific give γ 0 8 which produces optimal performance for wave dispersion in the open ocean the value of γ ranges from 0 4 to 3 2 over large scale seafloor features but the effective grid size for oblique wave directions and the decreasing grid spacing with latitude reduce the actual value of γ and the level of undesirable numerical dispersion in the non hydrostatic solution the good agreement over extended durations between the computed and recorded tsunami waveforms at locations as far as the chile coasts indicates accurate reproduction of the seafloor deformation at the tsunami source as well as the propagation processes across 16 000 km of the ocean we utilize tp mod to define the seafloor deformation for modeling of the 2011 tohoku tsunami across the north pacific using neowave the model input and setting from yamazaki et al 2018 provide the basis for a grid sensitivity analysis in hydrostatic and non hydrostatic computations of tsunami waves with varying bathymetry fig 9a shows the fault slip distribution and seafloor displacement at the end of the 2 5 min rupture the dislocation extends 240 km along dip and 400 km along strike with average slip reaching 22 and 37 m at subfaults near the epicenter and trench implementation of the planar fault solution of okada 1985 provides the time history of seafloor vertical displacement which in turn is augmented by horizontal displacement on local slopes tanioka and satake 1996 for modeling of tsunami generation via the non hydrostatic terms in neowave the final deformation with up to 2 m of subsidence near the coast 9 m of uplift adjacent to the epicenter and 7 and 33 m of vertical and horizontal displacements near the trench is consistent with the geodetic records from iinuma et al 2012 and ito et al 2011 both the hydrostatic and non hydrostatic computations of the tsunami utilize 1 2 and 5 arcmin grid spacing to examine sensitivity of numerical dispersion across the pacific a two way nested 1 arcmin grid is implemented over the source region within the 2 and 5 arcmin grids as shown in fig 9b for the hydrostatic modeling the vertical velocity term is disabled after the tsunami is generated and the resulting nonlinear shallow water equations are integrated with the semi implicit scheme for the rest of the computation the use of the same tsunami generation mechanism and near field resolution in the hydrostatic and non hydrostatic modeling allows direct comparison of the results to quantify dispersion effects from trans oceanic propagation figs 10 and 11 compare the non hydrostatic and hydrostatic solutions at 6 and 8 h after the earthquake as the tsunami passes through the western and major hawaiian islands the dominant 45 60 and 90 min components associated with the overall slip near the epicenter and trench are in the shallow water range across the pacific yamazaki et al 2018 but effects of dispersion or the lack of it are seen from the source to the wave front the non hydrostatic model with the 2 arcmin grid which at γ 0 8 has the optimal combination of intrinsic and numerical dispersion over a wide kh range fig 4b provides a reference for comparison the modeled waves show decreasing amplitude and period behind the leading crest the many seamounts and atolls in the western and central pacific produce prominent scattering of the trailing waves due to their shorter wavelengths associated with the detailed slip pattern the hydrostatic model at the same resolution underestimates dispersion even in the shallow water range fig 4a this results in a larger and more impulsive leading crest crisscrossed and followed by notably shorter waves in contrast to the non hydrostatic solution scattering of the trailing waves generates signals with less than 3 min period due to more pronounced nonlinear effects the artifacts are most evident along the emperor seamounts and the hawaiian islands obscuring the tsunami wave patterns the hydrostatic solution from the 5 arcmin grid can reproduce dispersion around the shallow water range with γ 4 fig 4a the amplitude and timing of the dominant components near the wave front compare reasonably well with the non hydrostatic solution but the short period artifacts remains in the trailing wave system due to the limited range of dispersion through numerical discretization alone dispersion plays a significant role in the overall amplitude and phase of trans oceanic tsunamis that have significant implications for geophysical research hazard assessment warning guidance and engineering design fig 12 plots the reference wave amplitude from the 2 arcmin non hydrostatic computation as well as the amplitude difference from those obtained using grid sizes of 1 to 5 arcmin with and without intrinsic dispersion the reference wave amplitude shows multiple energy lobes radiating from the source off the tohoku coast across the north pacific the non hydrostatic solution at finer grid spacing of 1 arcmin involves an 8 fold increase of the computing time but exhibits negligible differences from the reference amplitude as intrinsic dispersion in the governing equations is sufficient to describe the propagation processes and numerical dispersion is small for the grid spacing increasing the grid size to 5 arcmin overshoots numerical dispersion resulting in moderate reduction of wave amplitude primarily along the main energy lobes switching the non hydrostatic terms off reduces the computing time by a factor of four in neowave the lack of intrinsic dispersion results in overestimation of the wave amplitude across most of the north pacific increasing the grid size enhances numerical dispersion with gradual reduction of the wave amplitude the 5 arcmin grid can generate enough dispersion around the shallow water range to account for the dominant wave components the overestimated amplitude is due to insufficient dispersion of short period waves as well as presence of high frequency artifacts trailing the leading waves the large grid size of more than two times the average water depth might not fully resolve the small islands and seamounts as most evident in the wave amplitude overestimation in the well sheltered sea of okhotsk and sea of japan tables 1 and 2 compare the computed initial peak amplitude and arrival time with observations at selected dart stations across the north pacific see fig 12 for station locations the comparison at dart 21418 which is located 550 km from the source with relatively uniform bathymetry in between provides a straightforward demonstration of dispersion as in the gaussian hump numerical experiment the non hydrostatic computations at 1 and 2 arcmin grid spacing γ 0 8 give good agreement with the observed wave amplitude through a combination of intrinsic and numerical dispersion the computed amplitude deteriorates slightly at lower resolution due to excess numerical dispersion from the spatial discretization the hydrostatic model produces the optimal amount of discretization errors at 5 arcmin γ 4 in matching the observation but overestimates the amplitude at higher resolution due to insufficient dispersion tsunami arrival time is also influenced by earth elasticity and water density variation tsai et al 2013 baba et al 2017 which are typically not included in the governing equations for free surface flow the absence of these high order physical processes leads to early arrivals in both hydrostatic and non hydrostatic modeling of trans oceanic tsunamis bai and cheung 2016a at dart 21418 the initial peak from the non hydrostatic computation arrives 1 3 min early relatively independent of the grid spacing the more impulsive initial crest from the hydrostatic solution leads to an earlier arrival of the peak as seen in the gaussian hump experiment figs 6 and 7 the skewness of the computed initial crest is large and is an important factor for the timing of the peak in the near field but is somewhat reduced by numerical dispersion when the grid spacing is increased to 5 arcmin and improved agreement of the arrival time is observed the physical processes become more complex in the far field and the wave pattern is influenced by additional factors such as refraction diffraction and reflection of the broad band components by landmasses the effects are most pronounced at dart 21415 immediately to the east of the emperor seamount chain across from the tsunami source overall the non hydrostatic model continues to produce consistent results for the peak amplitude and arrival time that demonstrate convergence of the solution at 2 arcmin or finer grid spacing the offsets from observations are due to approximation or omission of physical processes other than dispersion the hydrostatic solution maintains the general trend associated with numerical dispersion but shows variations depending on the model resolution and station location the peak arrival time is closer to the non hydrostatic prediction albeit with interference from the short period artifacts and is less sensitive to grid spacing at the far field locations as wave skewness reduces with numerical dispersion over long distance of propagation except for dart 21415 the travel time from the non hydrostatic and hydrostatic models is typically 1 and 2 shorter than the observations the 1 difference between the two approaches is due to the respective celerity of the long period leading waves the effects of intrinsic and numerical dispersion on arrival time are secondary comparing to the peak amplitude which is influenced by harmonic components outside the shallow water range the computed peak amplitude from the hydrostatic model at 1 and 2 arcmin grid spacing can be 40 larger due to phase locking but even at the optimal resolution of 5 arcmin does not necessarily approach the non hydrostatic solution in contrast to the gaussian hump experiment the use of numerical dispersion through adjustment of grid spacing in a hydrostatic model does not always provide reliable wave amplitude in real world applications 7 discussion and conclusions the fourier method is an effective and straightforward alternative to the taylor expansion in deriving dispersion relations for high order wave models through the eigenvalue of the discretized linear governing equations the present study focuses on one layer non hydrostatic flows for tsunami modeling but the approach can be readily applied to multi layer or boussinesq type models for wind generated waves the extension of the fourier method from hydrostatic to non hydrostatic models simply increases the rank of the eigenvalue matrix from three to five the eigenvalue gives rise to a stability condition for the numerical scheme as well as a combined relation for intrinsic dispersion from the continuous governing equations and numerical dispersion as a phase error associated with the grid size and time step the discretization with a staggered finite difference scheme and first order semi implicit time integration remains neutrally stable with inclusion of the non hydrostatic terms through the keller box approach the dispersion relation is independent of the implicit solution of the non hydrostatic pressure and is exact for linear wave propagation over uniform depth implementation of taylor expansions to the dispersion relation produces a lead order approximation which demonstrates the interrelationship among the depth and discretization parameters in modulating dispersion the exact and lead order dispersion relations provide insights into the interplay between intrinsic and numerical dispersion during the computation as well as a useful tool to guide selection of discretization parameters for real world applications the depth parameter kh and spatial discretization kδx have complementary effects on dispersion providing a means to optimize non hydrostatic wave models through adjustment of the grid size their coupling results in notable reduction of numerical dispersion outside the shallow water range in comparison to the hydrostatic model the temporal discretization tends to reduce numerical dispersion but the effects are secondary within the range of courant numbers used in wave modeling numerical dispersion which results primarily from truncation errors associated with the spatial discretization decreases for oblique wave propagation due to effective increase in resolution and reaches a minimum at 45 from a principal axis of the grid the intrinsic property from the continuous governing equations accounts for a significant portion of physical dispersion and reduces the effects of spatial discretization thereby improving numerical modeling of broadband wave propagation discretization errors in shallow water models can mimic the lead order dispersion term from boussinesq type systems for tsunami modeling but the required grid size might not be sufficient to resolve the many seamounts and islands across the pacific in addition the lead order dispersion does not cover the full spectrum of tsunami waves resulting in phase locking of harmonic components during propagation and high frequency noise across the ocean the wave amplitude from a hydrostatic model is influenced by these numerical artifacts and sensitive to the spatial resolution commonly used in tsunami modeling the boussinesq type equations which have accurate dispersion in the tsunami range might be adversely affected by numerical dispersion a tsunami consists of a number of harmonics related to the complexity of the seafloor bathymetry and deformation at the source the wave components with varying dispersion properties need to be captured by a computational grid spanning across the ocean the keller box scheme leads to slight underestimation of dispersion in the governing equations of the non hydrostatic model the numerical solution can be tuned with grid spacing to achieve good and consistent convergence properties the use of a 2 arcmin grid is optimal in balancing intrinsic and numerical dispersion over the varying bathymetry across the pacific ocean the use of two way nested grids with increasing resolution from the open ocean to the coast has been a standard practice in tsunami hazard mapping e g imamura et al 1988 liu et al 1995 yamazaki et al 2011b for example the resolution can span a wide range from 2 arcmin 3700 m near the equator across the pacific ocean to as fine as 5 to 10 m at the shore e g bai et al 2018a yamazaki et al 2018 the primary purpose of grid refinement is to more precisely capture shelf and coastal features which play an important role in wave amplification and coastal inundation although the present study focuses on trans oceanic tsunami propagation the dispersion relation can provide guidance for grid refinement across shelf breaks the governing equations of the non hydrostatic model can describe dispersion within the tsunami range reasonably well the numerical means only serves as a secondary and convenient measure to refine the wave propagation property there exists an optimal grid size to water depth ratio but it is not necessary to keep refining the grid toward the shore because physical dispersion vanishes in the sheet flow as the water depth parameter kh 0 and numerical dispersion is negligible within the range of kδx commonly used for inundation modeling acknowledgments the authors received support from the national tsunami hazard mitigation

taylor method to analyze the semi implicit time integration used in neowave of yamazaki et al 2009 2011b for a direct comparison with the truncation properties in the leap frog scheme considering one

ζ i m δ t h u i 1 2 m 1 u i 1 2 m 1 δ x 0 where m denotes the current time step and i is an index at the cell center the staggered finite difference scheme introduces second order spatial discretization errors in the flow velocity and surface elevation the first order time integration is explicit for the flow velocity in the momentum equation a 1 and implicit for the surface elevation
