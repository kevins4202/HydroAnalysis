11005,subsurface drip irrigation is increasingly being used for sugarcane production in southeast brazil in attempts to conserve water especially after extreme droughts in 2014 and 2015 correct design of a subsurface drip system is essential to provide information about water and solutes dynamics in the subsurface leading to possible water savings while field investigations demand much time and financial resources numerical models can also provide much information about expected water and solute distributions in the soil profile the objective of this study was to use hydrus 2d for simulations of water and potassium movement in containers packed with a subsurface drip irrigated tropical soil cultivated with sugarcane and comparing simulated and observed data through statistical parameters investigations were carried out in a greenhouse during 240 days after the tillering stage spatial and temporal distributions of water content and potassium concentrations were collected using time domain reflectometry tdr to calibrate and validate hydrus 2d simulations were carried out using hydraulic properties fitted directly to measured retention date as well as estimated using pedotransfer functions rosetta lite and the class pedotransfer of carsel and parrish rmse and mae indicated a favorable capacity of the model to simulate soil water content using with measured properties and a better performance than estimated properties by pedotransfer functions for the potassium concentrations a less than optimal performance was obtained with hydrus 2d using both the measured hydraulic properties and the pedotransfer functions a better understanding and accurate determination of solute concentrations in soil uptake parameters the crop root growth and distribution should be necessary for improve the simulations and observed data the inability of hydrus 2d to accurately estimate potassium concentrations was not necessarily a limitation of model but rather a limitation of knowledge about the soil and plant parameters involved keywords subsurface drip fertigation sugarcane tropical soil hydrus 2d 1 introduction first introduced in 1532 sugarcane has always been important for brazil s economy brazil at present is not only the largest sugarcane producer in the world followed by india and china but also the largest producer of sugar and ethanol derived from sugarcane responsible for more than 50 of the world s sugar market sugarcane is cultivated in nearly all parts of the country severe droughts during 2014 and 2015 had a direct impact on sugarcane productivity productivity decreased especially dramatically in the brazilian southeast where rainfall remained far below the long term average along with high temperatures conab 2015 subsurface drip has become a viable alternative to traditional irrigation methods in terms of optimizing water and nutrient applications e g keller and bliesner 1990 ramos et al 2012 investigations conducted in são paulo state brazil about the viability of subsurface drip in sugarcane cultivation demonstrated an increase of 24 in stem yield and 23 in sugar yield relative to no irrigation gava et al 2011 dalri and cruz 2002 studied the effect of subsurface drip frequency on the initial development of sugarcane and found an average increase of 45 in fresh stem and leaf mass in relation to the control without irrigation júnior et al 2012 further showed a significant increase in sugar 25 3 mg ha 1 and ethanol 20 m3 ha 1 productivity with fertigation of 90 kg n ha 1 and 60 kg k ha 1 by subsurface drip dalri and cruz 2008 observed increases in sugarcane production of 43 and 62 for the second and third harvests respectively thus demonstrating good adaptation with this type of irrigation because of the high potassium demand of crops cultivated in tropical soils many studies have focused on the potassium dynamics in such soils miranda et al 2005 melo et al 2006 rivera et al 2006 pinho and miranda 2014 kolahchi and jalali 2007 found that potassium concentrations can increase substantially in groundwater by leaching groundwater near agricultural areas often show potassium concentrations above the limit for potable water 12 mg l 1 according to world health organization 2011 and griffioen 2001 the rational use of natural resources and avoiding or limiting environmental impacts because of poor management requires a thorough understanding of water and solute transport processes in irrigated soil profiles time domain reflectometry tdr has many advantages for monitoring water and solute transport processes such as its precision the use of multiple readings repetition without destruction of the soil and security bizari et al 2014 coelho and or 1996 elaiuy et al 2015 souza and folegatti 2010 however field investigations with tdr are often time consuming and costly plus may have some environmental impact because of the use of trenches during their installation numerical models can provide additional insight into prevailing water and solute transport processes in the subsurface the hydrus 2d software šimůnek et al 1999a 1999b šimůnek et al 2016 in particular has been used in a large number of drip irrigation and or fertigation studies cote et al 2003 doltra and muñoz 2010 kandelous and šimůnek 2010 li et al 2015 mguidiche et al 2015 provenzano 2007 ramos et al 2012 rodríguez sinobas et al 2012 skaggs et al 2004 of these mguidiche et al 2015 simulated volumetric soil water content in the potato crop under subsurface drip irrigation with the results showing relatively close agreement between simulated and measured data in the root zone provenzano 2007 showed the suitability of hydrus 2d to simulate water contents around a buried emitter during irrigation for roberts et al 2009 and mguidiche et al 2015 a better understanding of the processes that occur in a subsurface drip irrigated soil profile such as root growth and distribution as well as plant water uptake are essential for reliable modeling of the water and solute transport processes involved other studies used hydrus 2d to obtain also general information about solute transport processes in soils for example ajdary et al 2007 reported that nitrogen leaching in fields with shallow root systems can be minimized by appropriate selection of the flow rate and the time duration and intermittency of irrigation intervals doltra and muñoz 2010 obtained acceptable accuracy of the estimated soil n no3 contents of the upper 90 cm surface soil at four levels of fertigation during crop rotation while phogat et al 2014 used hydrus 2d to optimize the drip timescale for perennial horticultural crops to improve fertigation efficiency and limit groundwater contamination karandish and šimůnek 2017 concluded that hydrus 2d could be used to determine optimal strategies for deficit irrigation and partial root zone drying as a complement or even substitute of time consuming and expensive field studies most or all the above studies concerned non tropical soils by comparison few if any hydrus 2d investigations have focused on subsurface drip fertigation applications of tropical soils the objective of this study was to use hydrus 2d for simulations of water and potassium dynamics in greenhouse containers packed with a subsurface drip irrigated tropical soil cultivated with sugarcane and comparing simulated and observed data using statistical parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experiments was conducted during the tillering stage 2nd phenological stage between june 2015 to january 2016 in a greenhouse at the experimental area of the department of biosystems engineering university of são paulo leb esalq usp in piracicaba são paulo brazil 22 43 33 s 47 38 00 w elevation of 547 m according to the meteorological station installed inside the greenhouse average temperature global radiation and relative humidity were 24 8 c 19 2 mj m 2 day 1 and 78 7 during the experimental period three 500 l polyethylene containers 120 cm diameter and 60 cm high were uniformly packed with a sandy loam soil oxisol ustox collected in 0 30 cm depth with the initial soil water content of 0 15 cm3 cm 3 packing was done from the bottom of containers using five layers of 10 cm which the first bottom layer consisting of gravel covered by a geotextile blanket to avoid soil losses to the drain outlet subsequently four layers were packed in each container one emitter was installed per container at a depth of 25 cm button drippers had a flow rate equal to 4 0 l h 1 at a nominal pressure of 100 kpa the rb92579 sugarcane variety saccharum officinarum l was planted using 30 day old seedlings soil samples were collected to determine initial soil conditions such as selected physical and chemical properties table 1 a total of sixteen tdr probes 5 cm width and 10 cm length with three stainless steel rods 3 mm thickness were installed in four 10 cm layers and in one side of the containers fig 1 because of symmetry of the wetted soil volume measures according to kandelous et al 2011 soil water contents were monitored using a tdr calibration curve developed by ponciano et al 2015 1 θ 2 6953 1 0 5 k a 3 0 0016 k a 2 0 0395 k a 0 014 where θ is soil water content l3l 3 and ka the apparent dielectric constant obtained with tdr tdr calibration for the potassium concentration was performed with solution extractors to obtain a correlation between indirect and direct measurements of potassium in soil solution we used three treatments with three replicates c1 for deionized water and c2 and c3 for 500 and 2000 mg l 1 potassium concentrations respectively the calibration was carried out using 8 l buckets with a drain at the bottom buckets were packed using soil layers of 5 cm to the same bulk density as the containers and the initial soil water content of 0 15 cm3 cm 3 tdr probes and solution extractors for the calibration were installed in the center of each bucket the soil saturation was obtained by capillary ascension for 24 h we used the methodology of rhoades et al 1976 to determine the soil solution concentration as a function of soil water content which enables a relationship between the electrical conductivity estimated using tdr ectdr and the solution electrical conductivity ecs measured with an electrical conductivity meter the soil solution was collected 24 h after the application of 80 kpa vacuum inside the extractor for the correlations were determined the potassium ck and nitrate cno3 concentrations since the fertilizer kno3 contained these nutrient sources and therefore both affected ecs ck and cno3 were measured in laboratory with a flame photometer and a spectrophotometer respectively ectdr and ecs readings were accomplished weekly until the limit of 0 15 cm3 cm 3 the experimental design was completely randomized using three replicates for irrigation management of sugarcane we used the pressure head of 40 kpa steduto et al 2012 as the limit without crop water stress corresponding to 0 17 cm3 cm 3 when reaching this value irrigation started until the water content in the field capacity 0 24 cm3 cm 3 considering the soil area of 11 309 cm2 per container drainage during and after the irrigations was estimated from the volume collected through the drains fertigation was accomplished using a schedule as documented by malavolta 1994 agricultural activities during the experiments are summarized in table 2 2 2 hydrus 2d simulations the radially symmetric subsurface drip irrigation process was modeled using hydrus 2d šimůnek et al 1999a based on the following form of the richards equation for an isotropic soil profile cote et al 2003 ramos et al 2012 2

hydraulic parameters that were either fitted directly to observed retention curve fig 2 using eq 4 or obtained using pedotransfer functions for the measured hydraulic data we used undisturbed samples taken from the containers a total of 9 points were obtained gravimetric water contents at pressure heads of 10 20 40 and 100 cm using a tension table system and at 300 500 1000 5000 and 15000 cm using the richards pressure plate approach klute 1986 for the pedotransfer functions we used both the rosetta lite function of schaap et al 2001 and the class pedotransfer function of carsel and parrish 1988 as implemented in hydrus 2d for the rosetta estimates we used the measured granulometric data as well as the measured values of bulk density and water contents at 330 and 15000 cm table 3 lists the estimated hydraulic parameters 2 2 2 root water uptake the spatial root distribution was described using the model of vrugt et al 2001 7 β r z 1 r r m 1 z z m exp p r r r r m p z z z z m where β r z denotes the dimensionless two dimensional spatial distribution of root water uptake rm is the maximum rooting length in the radial direction l r is the radial distance from the origin of the plant l

into all available space in the containers zm 50 cm but concentrated mainly above the dripper r 2 cm z 25 cm where water and potassium were applied and then extended horizontally to 30 cm rm 30 cm reductions of root water uptake due to the water stress α1 h were described using the formulation of feddes et al 1978 8 α 1 h 0 h h 1 o r h h 4 h h 1 h 2 h 1 h 2 h h 1 1 h 3 h h 2 h h 4 h 3 h 4 h 4 h h 3 where h1 h2 h3 and h4 are the threshold parameters eq 8 assumes that water uptake is at its potential rate when the pressure head is between h2 and h3 decreases linearly when h h2 or h h3 and becomes zero when h h4 or h h1 the following parameters of the feddes et al 1978 model were used h1 10 h2 25 h3 150 to 500 h4 16000 cm which were taken from taylor and ashcroft 1972 for sugarcane potassium in a soil can generally be subdivided into four different fractions structural non exchangeable exchangeable and in soil solution whereby the latter can be taken up directly by plants with mass flow of water uptake barber 1995 sparks 1987 consequently we assumed that potassium was passively taken up by the root system of sugarcane šimůnek and hopmans 2009 by moving with the soil solution 2 2 3 potassium transport simulations of potassium transport were carried out using the three dimensional radially axisymmetric advection dispersion equation given by 9 θ r c t 1 r r r θ d r

potassium uptake process until some maximum value c s max šimůnek and hopmans 2009 assuming linear sorption of potassium by the solid phase the retardation factor r is given by 10 r 1 ρ k d θ where ρ is soil bulk density ml 3 and kd is the potassium distribution coefficient l3m 1 van genuchten and wierenga 1986 components of the dispersion tensor are given by the standard equations bear 1988 11 θ d r r θ d o τ λ l q r 2 q λ t q z 2 q θ d z z θ d o τ λ l q z 2 q λ t q r 2 q θ d r z λ l λ l q r q z q where do is the potassium ionic diffusion coefficient in free water l2t 1 τ is the tortuosity factor described here using the millington and quirk 1961 formulation and λ l and λ t are the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities l respectively and q represents the absolute value of the water flux lt 1 the diffusion coefficient for potassium was set at 1 7 cm2 day 1 miranda et al 2005 values of λ l and kd were derived from a simple one dimensional solute breakthrough experiments while λ t was taken to be one tenth of the value of λ t the 1 d transport experiments were carried out using 20 cm pvc columns having inside diameters of 5 cm filled with the same loamy sand soil as used for the containers the upper end of the column was fixed at a positive pressure head of 1 cm while a geotextile membrane and metal grille were used for the bottom boundary the columns were packed uniformly to the same bulk density as the containers and then saturated with deionized water for 24 h after saturation the columns were washed with deionized water for 24 h to remove most or all ions from the soil exchange complex after which a solution of 2000 mg l 1 of potassium was applied pinho and miranda 2014 breakthrough data were collected and subsequently analyzed using the cfitim code van genuchten 1981 within the stanmod software šimůnek et al 1999b 2 2 4 initial and boundary conditions a time variable flux boundary condition was applied to a semicircle with radium r0 of 2 cm at 25 cm depth fig 3 the boundary condition with a flux qd was defined as 12 q d v o l u m e o f s o l u t i o n a p p l i e d d a y a s w where the volume of solution applied l3 varied for different events and asw is the surface wetted area l2 given by 13 a s w 4 π r 0 2 where r0 is the radius of semicircle l during irrigation the dripper boundary was held at a constant water flux qd an atmospheric boundary condition was assumed for the entire soil surface a no flow boundary condition was established along the left and right edges of the soil profile and along part of the bottom of the container a drain was assumed at the bottom of container with the actual drainage flux being calculated similarly as eqs 12 and 13 the initial soil water content was 0 15 cm3 cm 3 while the initial concentration of potassium was estimated from measured soil chemical properties for solute k transport a third type boundary condition was imposed along the dripper and zero flux boundary along all sides except for a zero concentration gradient along the drain at the bottom of the container 2 3 flow domain and finite element mesh the dripper can be considered as a semicircle source fig 3 because the radially symmetric of subsurface drip irrigation process kandelous et al 2011 kandelous and šimůnek 2010 the transport domain was set as a rectangle in a radial direction with a width of 60 cm half of the container diameter and a depth of 50 cm discretized into 1959 two dimensional elements involving 1035 nodes fig 3 several observation nodes were included fig 4 at selected locations in the flow domain to follow simulated soil water contents and potassium concentrations versus time the observation nodes had very similar coordinates as the tdr probes installed in the containers to allow comparisons of observed and simulated data 2 4 estimation of potential evapotranspiration potential evapotranspiration was calculated using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 as implemented in the hydrus 1d software šimůnek et al 1998 the simulations require daily estimates of potential evaporation and transpiration fig 5 shows the partitioning of potential evapotranspiration etp into potential evaporation es and potential transpiration tp in correspondence to the leaf area index lai per unit surface of soil below the canopy at sowing nearly 100 of et comes from evaporation while at full crop cover more than 90 of et comes from transpiration allen et al 1998 specific crop data we used were as follow crop height 120 and 230 cm for 2nd and 3rd phenological stages respectively albedo 0 23 and 0 31 for 2nd and 3rd phenological stages respectively and lai 2 5 and 7 5 for 2nd and 3rd phenological stages respectively the latter calculated using 14 l a i 1 α i l n 1 s c f where αi is a constant for radiation extinction by the canopy and scf is the surface cover fraction the values of daily potential transpiration tp and soil evaporation es obtained fig 6 were used as time variable boundary conditions in the model during the experimental period a maximum tp of 7 9 mm occurred on day 237 31th january 2016 when the average temperature global radiation and relative humidity were the highest during the experiments 2 5 statistical analysis model performance for predicting soil water contents and potassium concentrations were evaluated in terms of the root mean square error rmse and the mean absolute error mae 15 r m s e i 1 n a i b i 2 n 16 m a e i 1 n a i b i n where ai and bi represent the observed and simulated water contents or potassium concentrations the surfer software was used for comparisons and mapping of the observed and simulated soil water content and potassium concentrations at selected dates we used kriging as the gridding method while the statistical analyses were carried out at preselected dates 3 results and discussion 3 1 tdr calibration for potassium concentration in this study we used an indirect tdr based method for determining potassium concentrations the approach requires careful correlation of the indirect electrical conductivity measurements ectdr with directly observed solution values ecs in the soil system being used fig 7 shows a relatively high correlation between ectdr and ecs as reflected by an r 2 value of 0 923 albeit with relatively high rmse and mae values 1 447 and 1 063 ds m 1 respectively indicating a less that satisfactory fit the calibration could be improved by carrying out multiple linear regression between electrical conductivity and tdr measured soil water contents 17 e c s 1 9790 e c t d r 0 0630 θ 0 0391 where ecs is the solution electrical conductivity ds m 1 ectdr is the electrical conductivity estimated using tdr ds m 1 and θ is the soil water content cm3 cm 3 the r2 value 0 960 was better but the errors remained high 0 536 and 0 400 ds m 1 for rmse and mae respectively reflecting a relatively poor adjustment potassium nitrate solution concentrations were correlated next with the electrical conductivity ecs by preparing different potassium concentrations 0 02 2 00 mg cm 3 in solution with deionized water the following correlation was obtained fig 8 18 c k n o 3 0 8699 e c s 0 0634 where ckno3 is the potassium nitrate concentration in solution mg cm 3 since our study focused on potassium transport we needed to separate the potassium and nitrate concentrations as shown fig 9 this produced the following correlation having an r2 of 0 987 19 c k 0 3760 c k n o 3 0 0281 where ck is the potassium concentration in solution mg cm 3 fig 10 compares indirectly measured potassium concentrations using tdr and direct measurements as reflected by an r 2 value of 0 995 rmse and mae were 0 038 and 0 030 ds m 1 respectively 3 2 potassium breakthrough curve fig 11 shows the measured potassium breakthrough curve plotted in terms of dimensionless concentration from 0 for the initial concentration to unity for the inlet concentration versus the number of pore volumes pv of solution leached through the column the use of dimensionless time is useful since it eliminates the effects of travel distance and flow velocity which are specific to any one experiment skaggs and leij 2002 20 p v ϕ v s v c where ϕ is the soil porosity decimal vs is the soil column volume cm3 and vc is the volume collected cm3 from each point of breakthrough curve from the fitted dimensionless transport data a column peclet number of 4 90 a retardation factor r of 1 79 the values of 4 08 cm for the longitudinal dispersivity λ l and 0 289 cm3 g 1 for the distribution coefficient kd which we used subsequently in the hydrus 2d simulations 3 3 simulations of soil water content the average soil water content of the first 0 25 cm layer of the containers as measured with eight tdr probes observed data and of the eight observation nodes simulated data as calculated with hydrus 2d are shown in fig 12 similar data are provided for the second 25 50 cm layer hydrus 2d overestimated volumetric water contents of the first layer before and at the time of the irrigations until about day 101 with simulated values varying between 0 16 and 0 27 cm3 cm 3 compared to the observed data between 0 16 and 0 23 cm3 cm 3 the maximum simulated value was above of field capacity which did not occur with the observed data however after this period the model simulated smaller water contents before irrigation until day 210 one plausible explanation is the assumption in hydrus 2d of having a constant crop rooting system in time because the model has no options to change the root system each day or during a certain period this may well be an important limitation for example assouline 2002 noted temporal changes in root growth and distribution of drip irrigated corn which also depended on the drip irrigation rate within 28 day periods while roberts et al 2009 illustrated these effects for successive crops of cantaloupe and broccoli and mguidiche et al 2015 for potato fig 12 shows that after day 210 simulated water contents became very similar to the observed data before irrigation varying from 0 16 to 0 17 cm3 cm 3 simulations of the second layer mostly agreed better with the data especially during the middle and later parts of the experiments when simulated water contents varied between about 0 18 to 0 30 cm3 cm 3 and observed values between 0 15 and 0 28 cm3 cm 3 notable differences between simulated and observed data remained between day 60 and the first irrigation on day 80 these changes can be explained in part by small differences in the coordinates of the tdr probes and the observation nodes in the model in addition to the differences in root growth distribution and water uptake observed experimentally and simulated with the model rmse values of observed versus simulated data were 0 027 and 0 030 cm3 cm 3 and mae values 0 023 and 0 024 cm3 cm 3 for the first and second layer respectively these values compare closely with results of other investigations crevoisier et al 2008 ghazouani et al 2016 kandelous and šimůnek 2010 mguidiche et al 2015 phogat et al 2014 ramos et al 2012 skaggs et al 2004 and show that hydrus 2d provides relatively accurate results also for subsurface drip irrigation with sugarcane fig 13 shows the maps of observed and simulated water content at different dates during the experiments the isolines had a very similar structure on day 2 one day after 1st irrigation however the model overestimated soil water contents by producing a maximum value of about 0 40 cm3 cm 3 compared to 0 36 cm3 cm 3 observed experimentally only the isolines with 0 18 cm3 cm 3 were close rmse and mae were 0 048 and 0 043 cm3 cm 3 respectively these values were higher than those of the average water content per day in each layer on day 83 one day before 2nd irrigation the observed isolines were relatively horizontal with the water content showing lower value in a homogeneous fashion from the container bottom to the soil surface hydrus 2d produced more concentrated isolines on the left side near the soil surface with simulated water contents being higher than the observed values along the entire profile the concentrated isolines near the dripper are indicative of the locally higher root distribution and hence water uptake rmse and mae were 0 051 and 0 050 cm3 cm 3 respectively higher observed and simulated values water contents occurred on the lower left side at day 84 irrigation day nevertheless the model overestimated all water contents in the soil profile on this day with numerical results being the least accurate as reflected also by rmse and mae values of 0 067 and 0 062 cm3 cm 3 respectively days 86 and 233 two days after irrigation showed similar behavior as day 84 with rmse values of 0 051 and 0 050 cm3 cm 3 and mae of 0 046 and 0 043 cm3 cm 3 respectively the observed isolines were relatively horizontal and the simulated isolines vertical on day 226 five days before irrigation the model underestimated the lower water contents 0 12 cm3 cm 3 and overestimated the higher values 0 30 cm3 cm 3 rmse and mae were 0 062 and 0 056 cm3 cm 3 respectively the same behavior of day 226 was present in days 230 one day before irrigation and 240 last observed day with rmse of 0 060 and 0 059 cm3 cm 3 respectively and mae of 0 052 cm3 cm 3 for both the best hydrus 2d simulations were obtained using the measured soil hydraulic properties we also ran the model using hydraulic properties based on rosetta schaap et al 2001 and the carsel and parrish 1988 pedotransfer functions fig 14 compares results using these pedotransfer functions with the measured properties for the first layer simulations with the rosetta function produced similar rmse and mae values 0 029 and 0 022 cm3 cm 3 respectively compared to using the measured hydraulic properties however rmse and mae for the second layer were 0 041 and 0 036 cm3 cm 3 these values were higher than those for the measured properties simulations with rosetta underestimated the water contents near days 125 200 especially during the drying events before the mid season irrigations results with the class pedotransfer functions by carsel and parrish 1988 were even less accurate giving rmse and mae of 0 038 and 0 030 cm3 cm 3 for the first layer and 0 050 and 0 044 cm3 cm 3 for the second layer respectively compared to the simulations using the measured properties one reason may be that the pedotransfer functions by carsel and parrish 1988 and to a lesser extent also those by schaap et al 2001 were derived nearly exclusively using temperate region soils data and hence may not be overly applicable to the tropical soil used in our study most notable again are the very low water content values especially in the second layer near the middle and end of the simulations simulated water contents were then only 0 09 to 0 16 cm3 cm 3 during pre irrigation drying thus causing apparent water stress problems for the sugarcane crop one reason of the lower water contents with the pedotransfer functions is the very low value of the wilting point and of the residual water content which contributed to a rapid reduction in the water content of the lower layers also in view of the adopted bottom boundary condition 3 4 simulations of potassium concentrations in soil solution fig 15 compares observed and simulated average potassium concentrations of the 0 25 and 25 50 cm layers hydrus 2d overestimated potassium concentrations of the first layer during most of the experimental period accurate results were obtained at the beginning but the model slightly underestimated the concentrations in some periods such as between days 94 106 and isolated days as 109 127 219 and 233 most notable is that simulated potassium concentrations generally remained constant between the fertigation periods as if the model did not consider any leaching from the container or other sinks like potassium uptake by the sugarcane roots these results point to the need to understand and describe relevant root solute uptake processes and parameters to be used by hydrus 2d including root growth and dynamic root distributions as discussed by assouline 2002 mguidiche et al 2015 and roberts et al 2009 simulated data in the first layer ranged from 0 08 to 0 25 mg cm 3 and observed data from 0 09 to 0 24 mg cm 3 results reflect a less than optimal performance of the model relative to the observed data simulated potassium results for the second layer intercalated between fluctuated between underestimation and overestimation relative to the observed data simulated concentrations during the fertigation applications were far below the observed data while remaining practically constant in between the applications and then higher than the observed data this suggest that potassium uptake by roots was passive and constant in each interval after the fertigation applications as seen for the 0 25 layer leading to concentrations that remained constant in time in experimental initial conditions it is important to notice that sodium concentration presents in chemical analyze was higher than potassium concentration one could presume that sodium influenced potassium dispersion because its lower atomic radius 280 pm and higher ionization energy 496 kj mol 1 as compared to potassium 227 pm and 419 kj mol 1 respectively which would have caused more spreading of potassium through the flow domain andrade 2009 this sodium influence and potassium dispersion were not considered in the simulations by the model the rmse and mae values for the first layer was 0 065 and 0 053 mg cm 3 respectively and for second layer of 0 135 and 0 105 mg cm 3 respectively similar values were found by others doltra and muñoz 2010 ramos et al 2011 phogat et al 2014 wang et al 2014 karandish and šimůnek 2017 however all those studies were carried out for nitrate leaching in temperate soils and not of potassium this demonstrates the importance of our study on potassium dynamics in a tropical soil including potential contamination of underlying groundwater fig 16 shows the distributions of observed and simulated potassium concentration at different dates the isolines showed difference behavior in day 83 one day before 1st fertigation in that the observed isolines were mostly horizontal with the potassium concentrations declining steadily between the container bottom and the soil surface hydrus 2d on the other hand showed far more vertical isolines on the left side with lower concentrations rmse and mae were 0 037 and 0 030 mg cm 3 respectively on day 86 the model overestimated the observed data on the left side close to dripper and underestimated the measurements in the lower left side the statistical parameters rmse and mae were 0 180 and 0 135 mg cm 3 respectively the distributions for days 127 the day of fertigation and 130 three days after fertigation were very similar to those on day 86 but with the model now underestimating the potassium concentrations in nearly the entire soil profile day 127 showed the worst performance of all plots having rmse and mae values of 0 284 and 0 207 mg cm 3 respectively rmse and mae for day 130 were 0 117 and 0 088 mg cm 3 respectively subsequent plots in fig 16 were for irrigations without fertigation days 226 230 233 and 240 the higher observed concentrations 0 32 to 0 26 mg cm 3 were now in the 25 40 cm layer in day 226 and the higher simulated concentrations 0 24 to 0 21 mg cm 3 in the 20 50 cm layer with rmse and mae of 0 078 and 0 063 mg cm 3 respectively the highest potassium concentrations obtained with hydrus 2d remained in the same layer at day 230 but with overestimated values on this day the higher observed concentrations started at the 25 cm depth showing rmse and mae of 0 080 and 0 070 mg cm 3 respectively the model underestimated the higher concentrations on day 233 with the concentrations slowly decreasing from a depth of 35 cm until the bottom of the container suggesting some leaching with the now potassium free irrigation water rmse and mae were 0 109 and 0 086 mg cm 3 respectively and the higher observed concentrations 0 26 to 0 22 mg cm 3 started in 20 cm depth a similar behavior of days 230 and 233 was present in day 240 last observed day with rmse and mae of 0 072 and 0 060 mg cm 3 respectively we further show in fig 17 how the calculated potassium concentrations in the soil profile were affected by using the measured hydraulic properties and estimated table 3 using pedotransfer functions rosetta lite by schaap et al 2001 and the carsel and parrish 1988 class pedotransfer functions the pedotransfer functions overestimated potassium concentrations in the 0 25 cm layer almost the entire experimental period results of measured and estimated hydraulic properties were close in the interval of days 92 108 however the concentrations were underestimated by the functions from day 219 the first layer showed rmse and mae values were 0 066 and 0 055 mg cm 3 when we used the rosetta actually very similar to those of the measured properties 0 065 and 0 053 mg cm 3 respectively rmse and mae were 0 082 and 0 068 mg cm 3 for the pedotransfer functions of carsel and parrish 1988 calculations for the 25 50 cm layer using the pedotransfer functions were nearly identical to the results using measured hydraulic properties rmse and mae were the same for measured properties and the rosetta function 0 135 and 0 105 mg cm 3 respectively while those for the carsel and parrish functions were only minimally larger 0 137 and 0 106 mg cm 3 respectively these results suggest that the relatively poor results for potassium fate and transport were not caused by the hydraulic properties but rather by incomplete or inaccurate knowledge of root growth and root distribution and related water and solute uptake processes and its parameters 4 conclusions the present research concerned a combination of observed and simulated data involving subsurface drip irrigation under sugarcane to evaluate hydrus 2d performance in water and potassium dynamics soil water contents monitored by tdr were predicted reasonably well through the technique calibration but potassium concentrations had a non consistent adjustment between variables parameters statistical indicated a favorable capacity of hydrus 2d model to simulate soil water content the measured hydraulic properties were found to generally lead to better water content predictions that the estimated functions the rosetta function actually produced very similar results as the measured properties for the first 0 25 cm layer but performed less well for the second 25 50 cm layer the carsel and parrish 1988 function by comparison performed relatively poorly for both layers for the potassium concentrations a less than optimal performance was obtained with hydrus 2d using both the measured hydraulic properties as well as the pedotransfer functions thus suggesting that overall model performance for potassium was not related to proper estimation of the hydraulic properties a better understanding and accurate determination of potassium concentration in soil profile uptake parameters schematization of the spatial and temporal crop root system should be necessary for improve simulations and observed data the inability of hydrus 2d to accurately estimate potassium concentrations hence should not be viewed as a limitation of the model as such but rather a limitation of our understanding of selected crop growth processes

11005,subsurface drip irrigation is increasingly being used for sugarcane production in southeast brazil in attempts to conserve water especially after extreme droughts in 2014 and 2015 correct design of a subsurface drip system is essential to provide information about water and solutes dynamics in the subsurface leading to possible water savings while field investigations demand much time and financial resources numerical models can also provide much information about expected water and solute distributions in the soil profile the objective of this study was to use hydrus 2d for simulations of water and potassium movement in containers packed with a subsurface drip irrigated tropical soil cultivated with sugarcane and comparing simulated and observed data through statistical parameters investigations were carried out in a greenhouse during 240 days after the tillering stage spatial and temporal distributions of water content and potassium concentrations were collected using time domain reflectometry tdr to calibrate and validate hydrus 2d simulations were carried out using hydraulic properties fitted directly to measured retention date as well as estimated using pedotransfer functions rosetta lite and the class pedotransfer of carsel and parrish rmse and mae indicated a favorable capacity of the model to simulate soil water content using with measured properties and a better performance than estimated properties by pedotransfer functions for the potassium concentrations a less than optimal performance was obtained with hydrus 2d using both the measured hydraulic properties and the pedotransfer functions a better understanding and accurate determination of solute concentrations in soil uptake parameters the crop root growth and distribution should be necessary for improve the simulations and observed data the inability of hydrus 2d to accurately estimate potassium concentrations was not necessarily a limitation of model but rather a limitation of knowledge about the soil and plant parameters involved keywords subsurface drip fertigation sugarcane tropical soil hydrus 2d 1 introduction first introduced in 1532 sugarcane has always been important for brazil s economy brazil at present is not only the largest sugarcane producer in the world followed by india and china but also the largest producer of sugar and ethanol derived from sugarcane responsible for more than 50 of the world s sugar market sugarcane is cultivated in nearly all parts of the country severe droughts during 2014 and 2015 had a direct impact on sugarcane productivity productivity decreased especially dramatically in the brazilian southeast where rainfall remained far below the long term average along with high temperatures conab 2015 subsurface drip has become a viable alternative to traditional irrigation methods in terms of optimizing water and nutrient applications e g keller and bliesner 1990 ramos et al 2012 investigations conducted in são paulo state brazil about the viability of subsurface drip in sugarcane cultivation demonstrated an increase of 24 in stem yield and 23 in sugar yield relative to no irrigation gava et al 2011 dalri and cruz 2002 studied the effect of subsurface drip frequency on the initial development of sugarcane and found an average increase of 45 in fresh stem and leaf mass in relation to the control without irrigation júnior et al 2012 further showed a significant increase in sugar 25 3 mg ha 1 and ethanol 20 m3 ha 1 productivity with fertigation of 90 kg n ha 1 and 60 kg k ha 1 by subsurface drip dalri and cruz 2008 observed increases in sugarcane production of 43 and 62 for the second and third harvests respectively thus demonstrating good adaptation with this type of irrigation because of the high potassium demand of crops cultivated in tropical soils many studies have focused on the potassium dynamics in such soils miranda et al 2005 melo et al 2006 rivera et al 2006 pinho and miranda 2014 kolahchi and jalali 2007 found that potassium concentrations can increase substantially in groundwater by leaching groundwater near agricultural areas often show potassium concentrations above the limit for potable water 12 mg l 1 according to world health organization 2011 and griffioen 2001 the rational use of natural resources and avoiding or limiting environmental impacts because of poor management requires a thorough understanding of water and solute transport processes in irrigated soil profiles time domain reflectometry tdr has many advantages for monitoring water and solute transport processes such as its precision the use of multiple readings repetition without destruction of the soil and security bizari et al 2014 coelho and or 1996 elaiuy et al 2015 souza and folegatti 2010 however field investigations with tdr are often time consuming and costly plus may have some environmental impact because of the use of trenches during their installation numerical models can provide additional insight into prevailing water and solute transport processes in the subsurface the hydrus 2d software šimůnek et al 1999a 1999b šimůnek et al 2016 in particular has been used in a large number of drip irrigation and or fertigation studies cote et al 2003 doltra and muñoz 2010 kandelous and šimůnek 2010 li et al 2015 mguidiche et al 2015 provenzano 2007 ramos et al 2012 rodríguez sinobas et al 2012 skaggs et al 2004 of these mguidiche et al 2015 simulated volumetric soil water content in the potato crop under subsurface drip irrigation with the results showing relatively close agreement between simulated and measured data in the root zone provenzano 2007 showed the suitability of hydrus 2d to simulate water contents around a buried emitter during irrigation for roberts et al 2009 and mguidiche et al 2015 a better understanding of the processes that occur in a subsurface drip irrigated soil profile such as root growth and distribution as well as plant water uptake are essential for reliable modeling of the water and solute transport processes involved other studies used hydrus 2d to obtain also general information about solute transport processes in soils for example ajdary et al 2007 reported that nitrogen leaching in fields with shallow root systems can be minimized by appropriate selection of the flow rate and the time duration and intermittency of irrigation intervals doltra and muñoz 2010 obtained acceptable accuracy of the estimated soil n no3 contents of the upper 90 cm surface soil at four levels of fertigation during crop rotation while phogat et al 2014 used hydrus 2d to optimize the drip timescale for perennial horticultural crops to improve fertigation efficiency and limit groundwater contamination karandish and šimůnek 2017 concluded that hydrus 2d could be used to determine optimal strategies for deficit irrigation and partial root zone drying as a complement or even substitute of time consuming and expensive field studies most or all the above studies concerned non tropical soils by comparison few if any hydrus 2d investigations have focused on subsurface drip fertigation applications of tropical soils the objective of this study was to use hydrus 2d for simulations of water and potassium dynamics in greenhouse containers packed with a subsurface drip irrigated tropical soil cultivated with sugarcane and comparing simulated and observed data using statistical parameters 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experiments was conducted during the tillering stage 2nd phenological stage between june 2015 to january 2016 in a greenhouse at the experimental area of the department of biosystems engineering university of são paulo leb esalq usp in piracicaba são paulo brazil 22 43 33 s 47 38 00 w elevation of 547 m according to the meteorological station installed inside the greenhouse average temperature global radiation and relative humidity were 24 8 c 19 2 mj m 2 day 1 and 78 7 during the experimental period three 500 l polyethylene containers 120 cm diameter and 60 cm high were uniformly packed with a sandy loam soil oxisol ustox collected in 0 30 cm depth with the initial soil water content of 0 15 cm3 cm 3 packing was done from the bottom of containers using five layers of 10 cm which the first bottom layer consisting of gravel covered by a geotextile blanket to avoid soil losses to the drain outlet subsequently four layers were packed in each container one emitter was installed per container at a depth of 25 cm button drippers had a flow rate equal to 4 0 l h 1 at a nominal pressure of 100 kpa the rb92579 sugarcane variety saccharum officinarum l was planted using 30 day old seedlings soil samples were collected to determine initial soil conditions such as selected physical and chemical properties table 1 a total of sixteen tdr probes 5 cm width and 10 cm length with three stainless steel rods 3 mm thickness were installed in four 10 cm layers and in one side of the containers fig 1 because of symmetry of the wetted soil volume measures according to kandelous et al 2011 soil water contents were monitored using a tdr calibration curve developed by ponciano et al 2015 1 θ 2 6953 1 0 5 k a 3 0 0016 k a 2 0 0395 k a 0 014 where θ is soil water content l3l 3 and ka the apparent dielectric constant obtained with tdr tdr calibration for the potassium concentration was performed with solution extractors to obtain a correlation between indirect and direct measurements of potassium in soil solution we used three treatments with three replicates c1 for deionized water and c2 and c3 for 500 and 2000 mg l 1 potassium concentrations respectively the calibration was carried out using 8 l buckets with a drain at the bottom buckets were packed using soil layers of 5 cm to the same bulk density as the containers and the initial soil water content of 0 15 cm3 cm 3 tdr probes and solution extractors for the calibration were installed in the center of each bucket the soil saturation was obtained by capillary ascension for 24 h we used the methodology of rhoades et al 1976 to determine the soil solution concentration as a function of soil water content which enables a relationship between the electrical conductivity estimated using tdr ectdr and the solution electrical conductivity ecs measured with an electrical conductivity meter the soil solution was collected 24 h after the application of 80 kpa vacuum inside the extractor for the correlations were determined the potassium ck and nitrate cno3 concentrations since the fertilizer kno3 contained these nutrient sources and therefore both affected ecs ck and cno3 were measured in laboratory with a flame photometer and a spectrophotometer respectively ectdr and ecs readings were accomplished weekly until the limit of 0 15 cm3 cm 3 the experimental design was completely randomized using three replicates for irrigation management of sugarcane we used the pressure head of 40 kpa steduto et al 2012 as the limit without crop water stress corresponding to 0 17 cm3 cm 3 when reaching this value irrigation started until the water content in the field capacity 0 24 cm3 cm 3 considering the soil area of 11 309 cm2 per container drainage during and after the irrigations was estimated from the volume collected through the drains fertigation was accomplished using a schedule as documented by malavolta 1994 agricultural activities during the experiments are summarized in table 2 2 2 hydrus 2d simulations the radially symmetric subsurface drip irrigation process was modeled using hydrus 2d šimůnek et al 1999a based on the following form of the richards equation for an isotropic soil profile cote et al 2003 ramos et al 2012 2

hydraulic parameters that were either fitted directly to observed retention curve fig 2 using eq 4 or obtained using pedotransfer functions for the measured hydraulic data we used undisturbed samples taken from the containers a total of 9 points were obtained gravimetric water contents at pressure heads of 10 20 40 and 100 cm using a tension table system and at 300 500 1000 5000 and 15000 cm using the richards pressure plate approach klute 1986 for the pedotransfer functions we used both the rosetta lite function of schaap et al 2001 and the class pedotransfer function of carsel and parrish 1988 as implemented in hydrus 2d for the rosetta estimates we used the measured granulometric data as well as the measured values of bulk density and water contents at 330 and 15000 cm table 3 lists the estimated hydraulic parameters 2 2 2 root water uptake the spatial root distribution was described using the model of vrugt et al 2001 7 β r z 1 r r m 1 z z m exp p r r r r m p z z z z m where β r

into all available space in the containers zm 50 cm but concentrated mainly above the dripper r 2 cm z 25 cm where water and potassium were applied and then extended horizontally to 30 cm rm 30 cm reductions of root water uptake due to the water stress α1 h were described using the formulation of feddes et al 1978 8 α 1 h 0 h h 1 o r h h 4 h h 1 h 2 h 1 h 2 h h 1 1 h 3 h h 2 h h 4 h 3 h 4 h 4 h h 3 where h1 h2 h3 and h4 are the threshold parameters eq 8 assumes that water uptake is at its potential rate when the pressure head is between h2 and h3 decreases linearly when h h2 or h h3 and becomes zero when h h4 or h h1 the following parameters of the feddes et al 1978 model were used h1 10 h2 25 h3 150 to 500 h4 16000 cm which were taken from taylor and ashcroft 1972 for sugarcane potassium in a soil can generally be subdivided into four different fractions structural non exchangeable exchangeable and in soil solution whereby the latter can be taken up directly by plants with mass flow of water uptake barber 1995 sparks 1987 consequently we assumed that potassium was passively taken up by the root system of sugarcane šimůnek and hopmans 2009 by moving with the soil solution 2 2 3 potassium transport simulations of potassium transport were carried out using the three dimensional radially axisymmetric advection dispersion equation given by 9 θ r c t 1 r r r θ d r

potassium uptake process until some maximum value c s max šimůnek and hopmans 2009 assuming linear sorption of potassium by the solid phase the retardation factor r is given by 10 r 1 ρ k d θ where ρ is soil bulk density ml 3 and kd is the potassium distribution coefficient l3m 1 van genuchten and wierenga 1986 components of the dispersion tensor are given by the standard equations bear 1988 11 θ d r r θ d o τ λ l q r 2 q λ t q z 2 q θ d z z θ d o τ λ l q z 2 q λ t q r 2 q θ d r z λ l λ l q r q z q where do is the potassium ionic diffusion coefficient in free water l2t 1 τ is the tortuosity factor described here using the millington and quirk 1961 formulation and λ l and λ t are the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities l respectively and q represents the absolute value of the water flux lt 1 the diffusion coefficient for potassium was set at 1 7 cm2 day 1 miranda et al 2005 values of λ l and kd were derived from a simple one dimensional solute breakthrough experiments while λ t was taken to be one tenth of the value of λ t the 1 d transport experiments were carried out using 20 cm pvc columns having inside diameters of 5 cm filled with the same loamy sand soil as used for the containers the upper end of the column was fixed at a positive pressure head of 1 cm while a geotextile membrane and metal grille were used for the bottom boundary the columns were packed uniformly to the same bulk density as the containers and then saturated with deionized water for 24 h after saturation the columns were washed with deionized water for 24 h to remove most or all ions from the soil exchange complex after which a solution of 2000 mg l 1 of potassium was applied pinho and miranda 2014 breakthrough data were collected and subsequently analyzed using the cfitim code van genuchten 1981 within the stanmod software šimůnek et al 1999b 2 2 4 initial and boundary conditions a time variable flux boundary condition was applied to a semicircle with radium r0 of 2 cm at 25 cm depth fig 3 the boundary condition with a flux qd was defined as 12 q d v o l u m e o f s o l u t i o n a p p l i e d d a y a s w where the volume of solution applied l3 varied for different events and asw is the surface wetted area l2 given by 13 a s w 4 π r 0 2 where r0 is the radius of semicircle l during irrigation the dripper boundary was held at a constant water flux qd an atmospheric boundary condition was assumed for the entire soil surface a no flow boundary condition was established along the left and right edges of the soil profile and along part of the bottom of the container a drain was assumed at the bottom of container with the actual drainage flux being calculated similarly as eqs 12 and 13 the initial soil water content was 0 15 cm3 cm 3 while the initial concentration of potassium was estimated from measured soil chemical properties for solute k transport a third type boundary condition was imposed along the dripper and zero flux boundary along all sides except for a zero concentration gradient along the drain at the bottom of the container 2 3 flow domain and finite element mesh the dripper can be considered as a semicircle source fig 3 because the radially symmetric of subsurface drip irrigation process kandelous et al 2011 kandelous and šimůnek 2010 the transport domain was set as a rectangle in a radial direction with a width of 60 cm half of the container diameter and a depth of 50 cm discretized into 1959 two dimensional elements involving 1035 nodes fig 3 several observation nodes were included fig 4 at selected locations in the flow domain to follow simulated soil water contents and potassium concentrations versus time the observation nodes had very similar coordinates as the tdr probes installed in the containers to allow comparisons of observed and simulated data 2 4 estimation of potential evapotranspiration potential evapotranspiration was calculated using the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 as implemented in the hydrus 1d software šimůnek et al 1998 the simulations require daily estimates of potential evaporation and transpiration fig 5 shows the partitioning of potential evapotranspiration etp into potential evaporation es and potential transpiration tp in correspondence to the leaf area index lai per unit surface of soil below the canopy at sowing nearly 100 of et comes from evaporation while at full crop cover more than 90 of et comes from transpiration allen et al 1998 specific crop data we used were as follow crop height 120 and 230 cm for 2nd and 3rd phenological stages respectively albedo 0 23 and 0 31 for 2nd and 3rd phenological stages respectively and lai 2 5 and 7 5 for 2nd and 3rd phenological stages respectively the latter calculated using 14 l a i 1 α i l n 1 s c f where αi is a constant for radiation extinction by the canopy and scf is the surface cover fraction the values of daily potential transpiration tp and soil evaporation es obtained fig 6 were used as time variable boundary conditions in the model during the experimental period a maximum tp of 7 9 mm occurred on day 237 31th january 2016 when the average temperature global radiation and relative humidity were the highest during the experiments 2 5 statistical analysis model performance for predicting soil water contents and potassium concentrations were evaluated in terms of the root mean square error rmse and the mean absolute error mae 15 r m s e i 1 n a i b i 2 n 16 m a e i 1 n a i b i n where ai and bi represent the observed and simulated water contents or potassium concentrations the surfer software was used for comparisons and mapping of the observed and simulated soil water content and potassium concentrations at selected dates we used kriging as the gridding method while the statistical analyses were carried out at preselected dates 3 results and discussion 3 1 tdr calibration for potassium concentration in this study we used an indirect tdr based method for determining potassium concentrations the approach requires careful correlation of the indirect electrical conductivity measurements ectdr with directly observed solution values ecs in the soil system being used fig 7 shows a relatively high correlation between ectdr and ecs as reflected by an r 2 value of 0 923 albeit with relatively high rmse and mae values 1 447 and 1 063 ds m 1 respectively indicating a less that satisfactory fit the calibration could be improved by carrying out multiple linear regression between electrical conductivity and tdr measured soil water contents 17 e c s 1 9790 e c t d r 0 0630 θ 0 0391 where ecs is the solution electrical conductivity ds m 1 ectdr is the electrical conductivity estimated using tdr ds m 1 and θ is the soil water content cm3 cm 3 the r2 value 0 960 was better but the errors remained high 0 536 and 0 400 ds m 1 for rmse and mae respectively reflecting a relatively poor adjustment potassium nitrate solution concentrations were correlated next with the electrical conductivity ecs by preparing different potassium concentrations 0 02 2 00 mg cm 3 in solution with deionized water the following correlation was obtained fig 8 18 c k n o 3 0 8699 e c s 0 0634 where ckno3 is the potassium nitrate concentration in solution mg cm 3 since our study focused on potassium transport we needed to separate the potassium and nitrate concentrations as shown fig 9 this produced the following correlation having an r2 of 0 987 19 c k 0 3760 c k n o 3 0 0281 where ck is the potassium concentration in solution mg cm 3 fig 10 compares indirectly measured potassium concentrations using tdr and direct measurements as reflected by an r 2 value of 0 995 rmse and mae were 0 038 and 0 030 ds m 1 respectively 3 2 potassium breakthrough curve fig 11 shows the measured potassium breakthrough curve plotted in terms of dimensionless concentration from 0 for the initial concentration to unity for the inlet concentration versus the number of pore volumes pv of solution leached through the column the use of dimensionless time is useful since it eliminates the effects of travel distance and flow velocity which are specific to any one experiment skaggs and leij 2002 20 p v ϕ v s v c where ϕ is the soil porosity decimal vs is the soil column volume cm3 and vc is the volume collected cm3 from each point of breakthrough curve from the fitted dimensionless transport data a column peclet number of 4 90 a retardation factor r of 1 79 the values of 4 08 cm for the longitudinal dispersivity λ l and 0 289 cm3 g 1 for the distribution coefficient kd which we used subsequently in the hydrus 2d simulations 3 3 simulations of soil water content the average soil water content of the first 0 25 cm layer of the containers as measured with eight tdr probes observed data and of the eight observation nodes simulated data as calculated with hydrus 2d are shown in fig 12 similar data are provided for the second 25 50 cm layer hydrus 2d overestimated volumetric water contents of the first layer before and at the time of the irrigations until about day 101 with simulated values varying between 0 16 and 0 27 cm3 cm 3 compared to the observed data between 0 16 and 0 23 cm3 cm 3 the maximum simulated value was above of field capacity which did not occur with the observed data however after this period the model simulated smaller water contents before irrigation until day 210 one plausible explanation is the assumption in hydrus 2d of having a constant crop rooting system in time because the model has no options to change the root system each day or during a certain period this may well be an important limitation for example assouline 2002 noted temporal changes in root growth and distribution of drip irrigated corn which also depended on the drip irrigation rate within 28 day periods while roberts et al 2009 illustrated these effects for successive crops of cantaloupe and broccoli and mguidiche et al 2015 for potato fig 12 shows that after day 210 simulated water contents became very similar to the observed data before irrigation varying from 0 16 to 0 17 cm3 cm 3 simulations of the second layer mostly agreed better with the data especially during the middle and later parts of the experiments when simulated water contents varied between about 0 18 to 0 30 cm3 cm 3 and observed values between 0 15 and 0 28 cm3 cm 3 notable differences between simulated and observed data remained between day 60 and the first irrigation on day 80 these changes can be explained in part by small differences in the coordinates of the tdr probes and the observation nodes in the model in addition to the differences in root growth distribution and water uptake observed experimentally and simulated with the model rmse values of observed versus simulated data were 0 027 and 0 030 cm3 cm 3 and mae values 0 023 and 0 024 cm3 cm 3 for the first and second layer respectively these values compare closely with results of other investigations crevoisier et al 2008 ghazouani et al 2016 kandelous and šimůnek 2010 mguidiche et al 2015 phogat et al 2014 ramos et al 2012 skaggs et al 2004 and show that hydrus 2d provides relatively accurate results also for subsurface drip irrigation with sugarcane fig 13 shows the maps of observed and simulated water content at different dates during the experiments the isolines had a very similar structure on day 2 one day after 1st irrigation however the model overestimated soil water contents by producing a maximum value of about 0 40 cm3 cm 3 compared to 0 36 cm3 cm 3 observed experimentally only the isolines with 0 18 cm3 cm 3 were close rmse and mae were 0 048 and 0 043 cm3 cm 3 respectively these values were higher than those of the average water content per day in each layer on day 83 one day before 2nd irrigation the observed isolines were relatively horizontal with the water content showing lower value in a homogeneous fashion from the container bottom to the soil surface hydrus 2d produced more concentrated isolines on the left side near the soil surface with simulated water contents being higher than the observed values along the entire profile the concentrated isolines near the dripper are indicative of the locally higher root distribution and hence water uptake rmse and mae were 0 051 and 0 050 cm3 cm 3 respectively higher observed and simulated values water contents occurred on the lower left side at day 84 irrigation day nevertheless the model overestimated all water contents in the soil profile on this day with numerical results being the least accurate as reflected also by rmse and mae values of 0 067 and 0 062 cm3 cm 3 respectively days 86 and 233 two days after irrigation showed similar behavior as day 84 with rmse values of 0 051 and 0 050 cm3 cm 3 and mae of 0 046 and 0 043 cm3 cm 3 respectively the observed isolines were relatively horizontal and the simulated isolines vertical on day 226 five days before irrigation the model underestimated the lower water contents 0 12 cm3 cm 3 and overestimated the higher values 0 30 cm3 cm 3 rmse and mae were 0 062 and 0 056 cm3 cm 3 respectively the same behavior of day 226 was present in days 230 one day before irrigation and 240 last observed day with rmse of 0 060 and 0 059 cm3 cm 3 respectively and mae of 0 052 cm3 cm 3 for both the best hydrus 2d simulations were obtained using the measured soil hydraulic properties we also ran the model using hydraulic properties based on rosetta schaap et al 2001 and the carsel and parrish 1988 pedotransfer functions fig 14 compares results using these pedotransfer functions with the measured properties for the first layer simulations with the rosetta function produced similar rmse and mae values 0 029 and 0 022 cm3 cm 3 respectively compared to using the measured hydraulic properties however rmse and mae for the second layer were 0 041 and 0 036 cm3 cm 3 these values were higher than those for the measured properties simulations with rosetta underestimated the water contents near days 125 200 especially during the drying events before the mid season irrigations results with the class pedotransfer functions by carsel and parrish 1988 were even less accurate giving rmse and mae of 0 038 and 0 030 cm3 cm 3 for the first layer and 0 050 and 0 044 cm3 cm 3 for the second layer respectively compared to the simulations using the measured properties one reason may be that the pedotransfer functions by carsel and parrish 1988 and to a lesser extent also those by schaap et al 2001 were derived nearly exclusively using temperate region soils data and hence may not be overly applicable to the tropical soil used in our study most notable again are the very low water content values especially in the second layer near the middle and end of the simulations simulated water contents were then only 0 09 to 0 16 cm3 cm 3 during pre irrigation drying thus causing apparent water stress problems for the sugarcane crop one reason of the lower water contents with the pedotransfer functions is the very low value of the wilting point and of the residual water content which contributed to a rapid reduction in the water content of the lower layers also in view of the adopted bottom boundary condition 3 4 simulations of potassium concentrations in soil solution fig 15 compares observed and simulated average potassium concentrations of the 0 25 and 25 50 cm layers hydrus 2d overestimated potassium concentrations of the first layer during most of the experimental period accurate results were obtained at the beginning but the model slightly underestimated the concentrations in some periods such as between days 94 106 and isolated days as 109 127 219 and 233 most notable is that simulated potassium concentrations generally remained constant between the fertigation periods as if the model did not consider any leaching from the container or other sinks like potassium uptake by the sugarcane roots these results point to the need to understand and describe relevant root solute uptake processes and parameters to be used by hydrus 2d including root growth and dynamic root distributions as discussed by assouline 2002 mguidiche et al 2015 and roberts et al 2009 simulated data in the first layer ranged from 0 08 to 0 25 mg cm 3 and observed data from 0 09 to 0 24 mg cm 3 results reflect a less than optimal performance of the model relative to the observed data simulated potassium results for the second layer intercalated between fluctuated between underestimation and overestimation relative to the observed data simulated concentrations during the fertigation applications were far below the observed data while remaining practically constant in between the applications and then higher than the observed data this suggest that potassium uptake by roots was passive and constant in each interval after the fertigation applications as seen for the 0 25 layer leading to concentrations that remained constant in time in experimental initial conditions it is important to notice that sodium concentration presents in chemical analyze was higher than potassium concentration one could presume that sodium influenced potassium dispersion because its lower atomic radius 280 pm and higher ionization energy 496 kj mol 1 as compared to potassium 227 pm and 419 kj mol 1 respectively which would have caused more spreading of potassium through the flow domain andrade 2009 this sodium influence and potassium dispersion were not considered in the simulations by the model the rmse and mae values for the first layer was 0 065 and 0 053 mg cm 3 respectively and for second layer of 0 135 and 0 105 mg cm 3 respectively similar values were found by others doltra and muñoz 2010 ramos et al 2011 phogat et al 2014 wang et al 2014 karandish and šimůnek 2017 however all those studies were carried out for nitrate leaching in temperate soils and not of potassium this demonstrates the importance of our study on potassium dynamics in a tropical soil including potential contamination of underlying groundwater fig 16 shows the distributions of observed and simulated potassium concentration at different dates the isolines showed difference behavior in day 83 one day before 1st fertigation in that the observed isolines were mostly horizontal with the potassium concentrations declining steadily between the container bottom and the soil surface hydrus 2d on the other hand showed far more vertical isolines on the left side with lower concentrations rmse and mae were 0 037 and 0 030 mg cm 3 respectively on day 86 the model overestimated the observed data on the left side close to dripper and underestimated the measurements in the lower left side the statistical parameters rmse and mae were 0 180 and 0 135 mg cm 3 respectively the distributions for days 127 the day of fertigation and 130 three days after fertigation were very similar to those on day 86 but with the model now underestimating the potassium concentrations in nearly the entire soil profile day 127 showed the worst performance of all plots having rmse and mae values of 0 284 and 0 207 mg cm 3 respectively rmse and mae for day 130 were 0 117 and 0 088 mg cm 3 respectively subsequent plots in fig 16 were for irrigations without fertigation days 226 230 233 and 240 the higher observed concentrations 0 32 to 0 26 mg cm 3 were now in the 25 40 cm layer in day 226 and the higher simulated concentrations 0 24 to 0 21 mg cm 3 in the 20 50 cm layer with rmse and mae of 0 078 and 0 063 mg cm 3 respectively the highest potassium concentrations obtained with hydrus 2d remained in the same layer at day 230 but with overestimated values on this day the higher observed concentrations started at the 25 cm depth showing rmse and mae of 0 080 and 0 070 mg cm 3 respectively the model underestimated the higher concentrations on day 233 with the concentrations slowly decreasing from a depth of 35 cm until the bottom of the container suggesting some leaching with the now potassium free irrigation water rmse and mae were 0 109 and 0 086 mg cm 3 respectively and the higher observed concentrations 0 26 to 0 22 mg cm 3 started in 20 cm depth a similar behavior of days 230 and 233 was present in day 240 last observed day with rmse and mae of 0 072 and 0 060 mg cm 3 respectively we further show in fig 17 how the calculated potassium concentrations in the soil profile were affected by using the measured hydraulic properties and estimated table 3 using pedotransfer functions rosetta lite by schaap et al 2001 and the carsel and parrish 1988 class pedotransfer functions the pedotransfer functions overestimated potassium concentrations in the 0 25 cm layer almost the entire experimental period results of measured and estimated hydraulic properties were close in the interval of days 92 108 however the concentrations were underestimated by the functions from day 219 the first layer showed rmse and mae values were 0 066 and 0 055 mg cm 3 when we used the rosetta actually very similar to those of the measured properties 0 065 and 0 053 mg cm 3 respectively rmse and mae were 0 082 and 0 068 mg cm 3 for the pedotransfer functions of carsel and parrish 1988 calculations for the 25 50 cm layer using the pedotransfer functions were nearly identical to the results using measured hydraulic properties rmse and mae were the same for measured properties and the rosetta function 0 135 and 0 105 mg cm 3 respectively while those for the carsel and parrish functions were only minimally larger 0 137 and 0 106 mg cm 3 respectively these results suggest that the relatively poor results for potassium fate and transport were not caused by the hydraulic properties but rather by incomplete or inaccurate knowledge of root growth and root distribution and related water and solute uptake processes and its parameters 4 conclusions the present research concerned a combination of observed and simulated data involving subsurface drip irrigation under sugarcane to evaluate hydrus 2d performance in water and potassium dynamics soil water contents monitored by tdr were predicted reasonably well through the technique calibration but potassium concentrations had a non consistent adjustment between variables parameters statistical indicated a favorable capacity of hydrus 2d model to simulate soil water content the measured hydraulic properties were found to generally lead to better water content predictions that the estimated functions the rosetta function actually produced very similar results as the measured properties for the first 0 25 cm layer but performed less well for the second 25 50 cm layer the carsel and parrish 1988 function by comparison performed relatively poorly for both layers for the potassium concentrations a less than optimal performance was obtained with hydrus 2d using both the measured hydraulic properties as well as the pedotransfer functions thus suggesting that overall model performance for potassium was not related to proper estimation of the hydraulic properties a better understanding and accurate determination of potassium concentration in soil profile uptake parameters schematization of the spatial and temporal crop root system should be necessary for improve simulations and observed data the inability of hydrus 2d to accurately estimate potassium concentrations hence should not be viewed as a limitation of the model as such but rather a limitation of our understanding of selected crop growth processes

rotation crop yield increase fertilization soil water use tillage rotation 1 introduction as an important rainfed crop production area water shortage and soil nutrients depletion are considered to be the most limiting factors in the loess plateau china wang et al 2009 sustained crop productivity relies on constant renewal of soil nutrients and water supply wang and shangguan 2015 yousaf et al 2017 hence application of chemical fertilizers and increased water capture are necessary for enhancing crop yields and sustaining soil fertility to pursue high crop yield excessive fertilizers have been applied to fields by farmers in recent years liu et al 2013 however inappropriate or excessive fertilizer application does not guarantee constantly increasing yields potentially results in low nutrients efficiency and causes environmental problems in agro ecosystems wang et al 2012a b with excessive fertilization more soil water is consumed a situation exacerbated by water shortage in fields zhang et al 2015b limited by climate and geographical conditions annual winter wheat summer fallow or annual spring maize winter fallow is the prevailing crop system in this area there is a fallow period each year however the prevailing conventional tillage applied after crop harvest aggravates the water deficit during fallow periods zhao et al 2009 in this area conventional tillage means plowing and turning the surface soil at deep levels the bare soil surface brings high evaporation in fallow periods and causes a dry soil water condition for crop growth in subsequent years feng et al 2011 he et al 2006 huang et al 2006 the prevailing conventional tillage and excessive fertilization practices create a severe water deficit conservation tillage including crop residue mulching no tillage subsoiling and rotary tillage etc has been recommended as an effective practice to conserve soil water and enhance soil fertility alleviating soil water shortage under rainfed conditions in numerous areas hou et al 2012 xie et al 2016 however continuous mono one tillage practice applied annually would bring some defects to crop growth and soil in field such as long time no tillage would lead to compact soil surface and more weeds in fields long time conventional tillage would result in high soil water evaporation and soil erosion tillage rotation has been reported as one of the most recommended tillage practices for conserving soil water in this area zhang et al 2015a rotation of two or three practices including no tillage subsoiling and conventional tillage in a specific sequence can offset some defects brought about by annual one tillage practices enhanced the soil structure and incorporated crop residue to field tillage rotation can capture precipitation effectively conserve soil water in fallow periods and enhance the soil nutrient conditions in fields hou et al 2012 sun et al 2010 zhu et al 2015 although tillage rotation has a significant effect on soil fertility it cannot entirely replace the benefits of fertilizers farmers without access to mineral fertilizer cannot compensate for n deficiencies and will suffer yield reductions as a direct result giller et al 2009 moreover straw mulching straw returned to field and covered on soil surface with fertilizers promotes higher crop yields and fertilizer efficiency fan et al 2004 as a major component of nt straw mulching has been proven as one of the most effective measures for conserving soil water feng et al 2011 thus proper fertilization with tillage rotation has significant importance in rainfed dryland agriculture however the effects of tillage rotations on crop yield and soil conditions have primarily focused on short term experiments 2 5 years in this area and the results were not consistent with previous studies hou et al 2012 nie et al 2015 zhu et al 2015 relevant long term experiments on tillage rotation with fertilization are limited with proper fertilization tillage rotation may couple soil water and nutrients rationally and function more effectively and economically in addition the effects of conservation tillage rotation and fertilization on soil water and crop yield is a long and sustainable process and these effects are site and climate dependent xie et al 2016 therefore determination of an appropriate tillage rotation system with fertilization is essential for crop production on the loess plateau hence a long term experiment ten years conducted in heyang shaanxi province china was established to study soil water use and crop yield in a spring maize winter wheat fallow rotation field over a two year period our objectives were to study the soil water conservation effect in fallow periods soil water use during growth periods and crop yield variation in rainfed fields and to select an optimal tillage rotation with fertilization for crop production on the loess plateau 2 methods 2 1 study site description the field experiment has been conducted since 2007 at the dryland agricultural research station of northwest a f university which is located in ganjing 35 19 n 106 4 e heyang county shaanxi province china the research station was located on the loess plateau which is characterized by a temperate semi arid continental monsoon climate at an altitude of 877 m the annual mean temperature and evaporation were 11 5 c and 1833 mm respectively during the last 30 years the annual mean precipitation was 526 mm the data derived from heyang weather station the annual precipitation displayed an uneven characteristic 60 of which mainly occurred in the summer season july august and september that deviated from the winter wheat growth season the climate details for this experiment are shown in fig 1 before the experiment continuous spring maize was planted and conventional tillage with crop residue removal or burning was applied every year after crop harvest the field experiment was conducted on level terrain with dark loessial soil which is a typical soil type in the loess plateau and it is classified as middle loam soil based on the fao unesco soil classification 1993 the soil properties and nutrient conditions at a soil depth of 0 60 cm before this experiment started in 2007 are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental design and treatments the field experiment was designed with three fertilizations balanced fertilization bf low fertilization lf and conventional fertilization cf as the main treatments and was spilt into four tillage practices no tillage rotated with subsoiling annually ns subsoiling rotated with conventional tillage annually sc conventional tillage rotated with no tillage annually cn and continuous conventional tillage ct as sub treatments each sub plot was 5 m wide and 22 5 m long 112 5 m2 with a 60 cm interval between plots these three fertilization and four tillage practices were combined into twelve fertilization with tillage rotation systems table 2 bns bf ns bsc bf sc bcn bf cn bct bf ct lns lf ns lsc lf sc lcn lf cn lct lf ct cns cf ns csc cf sc ccn cf cn cct cf ct the fertilizers were spread evenly on the soil surface before sowing the fertilizers for n were urea and diammonium phosphate the fertilizer for p2o5 was diammonium phosphate the fertilizer for p2o5 was potassium chloride for the balanced fertilization bf 150 kg n ha 1 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 90 kg k2o ha 1 were applied to the soil before sowing each year for the low fertilization lf 75 kg n ha 1 60 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 45 kg k2o ha 1 were applied to the soil before sowing for the conventional fertilization cf 255 kg n ha 1 and 180 kg p2o5 ha 1 were applied to the soil before sowing each year the soil in the loess plateau is rich in potassium k and the soil total k is relatively high so farmers generally apply fertilizers without potassium conventional fertilization cf was determined according to the mean fertilization level of the local farmers balanced fertilization bf was applied at the recommended rate determined by the local soil nutrient conditions and adequate nutrient ratios of crop production the fertilizer rate of low fertilization lf was one half that of balanced fertilization ns treatment means no tillage applied in the first year and rotated with subsoiling in the second year and the following years would replicate the rotation in the first and second year by sequence sc treatment means subsoiling applied in the first year and rotated with conventional tillage in the second year and the following years would replicate the rotation in the first and second year by sequence cn treatment means conventional tillage applied in the first year and rotated with no tillage in the second year and the following years would replicate the rotation in the first and second year by sequence ct treatment means conventional tillage applied each year for the no tillage practice the crop straw was chopped and spread evenly on the surface of the experimental plots after the harvest of the previous crop using a combine harvester for the subsoiling practice the crop straw was left on the soil surface as mulch and the soil was then subsoiled to a depth of 30 35 cm with an interval of 60 cm by a subsoiler with adjustable wings the surface soil had little disturbance with the subsoiling all tillage practices were applied after the crop harvests for the conventional tillage practice the crop straw was incorporated into the soil layer and plowed to a depth of 22 25 cm for all tillage practices there was a one time herbicide spray in the fallow period and no other soil disturbance or management was applied before sowing to produce a good soil condition for crop emergence and improve the effect of fertilizers rotary tillage was applied at crop sowing one time each year the cultivated varieties of winter wheat were jinmai 47 in 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 and 2013 2014 and chang 6359 in 2015 2016 table 3 the cultivated varieties of spring maize were yuyu 22 in 2009 2011 and 2013 and zhengdan 958 in 2015 winter wheat and spring maize were sown at a density of 3 3 million plants ha 1 and 60 thousand plants ha 1 respectively the row spaces for winter wheat and spring maize were 0 2 m and 0 6 m respectively the operation of tillage practices and crop planting details are shown in fig 2 and table 3 2 3 measurements the gravimetric water content was multiplied by the soil bulk density which measured every year after crop harvest to obtain the volumetric water content soil water storage was calculated for a 2 0 m profile by multiplying the mean soil volumetric water content by soil profile depth the soil moisture storage was measured using a 5 cm soil auger at 20 cm increments to a depth of 200 cm with three replications in all experimental plots every month the soil water content was determined using the oven drying method the crop yield was determined by manual harvesting threshing and air drying grain from three 3 m2 and 9 m2 areas selected at random in each plot for winter wheat and spring maize respectively the requisite indices were calculated according to the following

difference between sc rotation and ct was not significant in the first experimental year of 2008 the difference among tillage practices was not significant and the difference was primarily due to fertilization fig 3 in subsequent years differences occurred and ccn 5440 kg ha 1 and lsc 3799 kg ha 1 produced the highest and lowest average wheat yield in ten years respectively cns bns bsc and bcn

fallow periods lns 419 mm and lcn 412 mm always showed better soil water conditions at the end of the fallow period p 0 05 fig 6 a after a spring maize winter wheat rotation the soil water storage was relatively low at the beginning of the fallow period with the arrival of the rainy season july august and september the water storage increased significantly and the difference between fertilization and tillage treatments was significant p 0 05 fig 6b following a dry winter season and evaporation the soil water storage decreased and this difference declined 3 4 soil water variation during crop growth to further explore the soil water use and redistribution of spring maize winter wheat rotation the total soil water storage in 0 2 m at important crop growth stages was studied fig 7 3 4 1 winter wheat during growth season of winter wheat the soil water storage declined persistently with the wheat growth fig 7 the sowing time mean value 435 mm performed the highest soil water storage and consumed nearly 33 6 of that when it harvested mean value 289 mm from jointing stage to filling time the soil water storage declined sharply that due to the fast growth of winter wheat differences among different fertilization with tillage systems were significant p 0 05 and lns mean value 381 mm showed better soil water storage through the whole wheat growth season while bct mean value 348 mm showed less soil water storage 3 4 2 spring maize unlike the soil water dynamics of winter wheat the soil water storage of spring maize at sowing stage mean value 404 mm and harvest time mean value 415 mm keep on the same level fig 7 at seedling stage soil water storage increased that due to the more precipitation at summer season june july august from seedling to filling stage soil water storage declined sharply which due to the high evaporation in summer season and emergency requirement for crop growth but the crop consumed little soil water when it finished filling with the rainy season at august the soil water increased from filling stage to harvest time during maize growth season differences among different fertilization with tillage systems were significant p 0 05 and lns mean value 410 mm showed better soil water storage through the whole wheat growth season while bct mean value 391 mm showed less soil water storage 3 5 wue 3 5 1 winter wheat the wue of winter wheat

conservation in rainfed areas crop yield depended on soil water storage at sowing and effective precipitation during the crop growth season meng et al 2012 sang et al 2016 this demonstrated that soil water at sowing time plays an important role in crop production in dryland agriculture in this study there was a long term fallow period from late june after the winter wheat harvest to late april before maize sowing the following year followed by a consecutive spring maize and winter wheat rotation growth season thus better soil water conservation in the fallow period would provide a better soil condition for the subsequent production of maize and wheat due to the better rainfall capture and soil water conservation effect of straw mulching in no tillage giller et al 2009 ns and cn rotations provided higher soil water storage in the fallow period in addition tillage rotations that enhanced the soil physical properties also promoted soil water movement that led to better soil water conditions in the deep soil hou et al 2012 sang et al 2016 as a result of the combination of bare soil surface and intensive evaporation of ct sc and ct resulted in low soil water storage moreover the better soil texture and aeration of tillage rotation may cause more evaporation and lead to lower soil water in sc than ct although et of different tillage rotations and fertilizations had no significant effect in ten years cf and ct showed a higher average et than other treatments this would result in lower soil water storage in long term crop production in agreement with a previous study on the loess plateau zhang et al 2015b high fertilization would consume more soil water and lead to less soil water than low fertilization moreover crop rotation and the significant interaction of fertilization and tillage rotation also would affect the soil water storage in this study this needs to be further explored in the future 4 2 soil water use a good soil water condition is the basis for obtaining a high and sustainable crop yield yan et al 2002 especially in the critical growth period the sharp decline of soil water from the heading stage to the filling stage illustrated the importance of soil water at a critical stage despite the special case in the filling stage of spring maize the soil water conditions of ns and cn showed better soil water conditions in the entire winter wheat spring maize growth season especially in deep soil layers this may be attributed to the better soil water condition in the fallow period and soil water movement of tillage rotations the higher soil water storage in the fallow period provided a better soil water condition for maize sowing in ns and cn rotations in the following maize growth season straw mulching reduced evaporation on the soil surface and produced more effective soil water for crop growth zhao et al 2014 in addition tillage rotations improved the soil structure promoted the growth of roots and fully utilized the soil water in the surface and deep soil layers nie et al 2015 zhu et al 2015 this led to better soil water conditions and high wues during the maize growth season in ns and cn rotations the different soil water distribution at the maize filling stage and the lower difference among tillage systems from sowing time to filling stage was also due to the water use of tillage rotations and the special crop rotation in this study unlike our prediction initially intensive soil water consumption did not affect subsequent wheat growth the high rainfall at maize harvest time restored the soil water rapidly and ensured good soil water conditions for wheat especially in ns and cn rotations the better soil structure and water movement provided better soil water in the deep soil layer hou et al 2012 sun et al 2010 in contrast to spring maize the soil water in the wheat growth season was greatly diminished however the long term fallow period followed by the wheat growth season can replenish the soil water and provide good soil water conditions for the following crop rotation cycle this is an advantage of wheat maize rotation this typical rotation can restore soil water seasonably and provide sufficient soil water for crop growth furthermore the long term fallow period in this rotation provided sufficient time for the decomposition of crop residue and enhanced soil properties for crop growth surprisingly with straw mulching tillage rotations did not significantly decrease et during this crop rotation however water was utilized effectively and increased the wue this does not agree with previous studies on the loess plateau wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2015a b previous studies showed that tillage rotations have a significant effect on et the different results may be due to the typical benefits brought by crop and tillage rotations in this study no tillage with straw mulching reduced evaporation on the soil surface wang et al 2012a b but subsoiling promoted soil water depletion on roots in deep soil layers cai et al 2014 moreover the typical crop rotation also affected crop growth and water use this should be further studied regarding fertilization et was not significant but the higher et during crop growth season and low soil water storage in fallow period in cf that would exaggerate the difference of soil water storage among different fertilization treatments zhang et al 2015b 4 3 crop yield increase due to the coordination and interaction of tillage rotations and fertilization the highest average crop yield was observed in bns and was followed by bcn in this study the reasonable colocalization of soil water and soil nutrients provided a better crop growth condition for obtaining high crop yields in bf meng et al 2012 excessive fertilization causes no significant increase in crop yield but the soil water would decrease liu et al 2013 zhang et al 2015b additional fertilizer input would cause low fertilizer efficiency unused fertilizer and environmental pollution yousaf et al 2017 application of a balanced fertilizer with n p and k would increase wheat yield at a rate of 5 8 kg kg 1 n p and k fertilizer has the benefit of enhancing each component liu et al 2013 although the soil in the loess plateau is rich in k it does not facilitate long term high crop production a balanced n p and k treatment would improve the crop yield and avoid further deterioration of soil fertility the absence of least one major nutrient i e either n p or k would cause a specific nutrient deficiency stress and retard crop growth with a concomitant reduction in yield yousaf et al 2017 thus the lack of k in cf limited the positive effect of n and p on crop yield yousaf et al 2017 the factors by which tillage practices influence crop growth are complex chen et al 2011 the changes in soil quality such as soil moisture soil temperature and soil nutrient availability have all been considered as the dominant reasons for crop yield differences among tillage practices soane et al 2012 ns and cn provide favorable water during the crop growth season and st loosens soil structure zhang et al 2017 this promotes soil water movement and crop root growth in the deep soil layer liu et al 2015 the interaction of water and balanced soil nutrients eventually increases crop yield optimized or balanced fertilization with proper tillage practices can effectively increase soil water and crop yield these practices are an effective way to increase crop yield and income in dryland agriculture 5 conclusion in ten years lf ns and cn showed a better soil water condition in the fallow period during the spring maize winter wheat growth season ns and cn rotations provided higher soil water especially in the deep soil layers for the entire

11006,water shortage and soil nutritionally depleted are the most limiting factors of crop production on the loess plateau conservation tillage rotation conserved soil water and enhanced soil fertility effectively produced high and stable crop yields in a spring maize winter wheat fallow rotation over a two year period hereafter called maize wheat fallow rotation corresponding and appropriate fertilization practices should enable the full potential of tillage rotation therefore a long term two factor split plot experiment 2007 2016 was established in heyang county shaanxi

tillage systems no tillage rotated with subsoiling annually ns subsoiling rotated with conventional tillage annually sc conventional tillage rotated with no tillage annually cn and continuous conventional tillage ct were conducted to assess crop yield and soil water variation the results showed that ccn cf cn 5440 kg ha 1 and bns bf ns 8415 kg ha 1 produced the highest crop yield for winter wheat and spring maize respectively lns lf ns 419 mm had a better soil water condition in fallow periods ns and cn rotations had a better soil water condition reserved more soil water for crop

wheat and maize yield respectively soil water in fallow 388 mm are recommended as the optimal fertilization and tillage rotations for rainfed crop production on the loess plateau keywords crop rotation crop yield increase fertilization soil water use tillage rotation 1 introduction as an important rainfed crop production area water shortage and soil nutrients depletion are considered to be the most limiting factors in the loess plateau china wang et al 2009 sustained crop productivity relies on constant renewal of soil nutrients and water supply wang and shangguan 2015 yousaf et al 2017 hence application of chemical fertilizers and increased water capture are necessary for enhancing crop yields and sustaining soil fertility to pursue high crop yield excessive fertilizers have been applied to fields by farmers in recent years liu et al 2013 however inappropriate or excessive fertilizer application does not guarantee constantly increasing yields potentially results in low nutrients efficiency and causes environmental problems in agro ecosystems wang et al 2012a b with excessive fertilization more soil water is consumed a situation exacerbated by water shortage in fields zhang et al 2015b limited by climate and geographical conditions annual winter wheat summer fallow or annual spring maize winter fallow is the prevailing crop system in this area there is a fallow period each year however the prevailing conventional tillage applied after crop harvest aggravates the water deficit during fallow periods zhao et al 2009 in this area conventional tillage means plowing and turning the surface soil at deep levels the bare soil surface brings high evaporation in fallow periods and causes a dry soil water condition for crop growth in subsequent years feng et al 2011 he et al 2006 huang et al 2006 the prevailing conventional tillage and excessive fertilization practices create a severe water deficit conservation tillage including crop residue mulching no tillage subsoiling and rotary tillage etc has been recommended as an effective practice to conserve soil water and enhance soil fertility alleviating soil water shortage under rainfed conditions in numerous areas hou et al 2012 xie et al 2016 however continuous mono one tillage practice applied annually would bring some defects to crop growth and soil in field such as long time no tillage would lead to compact soil surface and more weeds in fields long time conventional tillage would result in high soil water evaporation and soil erosion tillage rotation has been reported as one of the most recommended tillage practices for conserving soil water in this area zhang et al 2015a rotation of two or three practices including no tillage subsoiling and conventional tillage in a specific sequence can offset some defects brought about by annual one tillage practices enhanced the soil structure and incorporated crop residue to field tillage rotation can capture precipitation effectively conserve soil water in fallow periods and enhance the soil nutrient conditions in fields hou et al 2012 sun et al 2010 zhu et al 2015 although tillage rotation has a significant effect on soil fertility it cannot entirely replace the benefits of fertilizers farmers without access to mineral fertilizer cannot compensate for n deficiencies and will suffer yield reductions as a direct result giller et al 2009 moreover straw mulching straw returned to field and covered on soil surface with fertilizers promotes higher crop yields and fertilizer efficiency fan et al 2004 as a major component of nt straw mulching has been proven as one of the most effective measures for conserving soil water feng et al 2011 thus proper fertilization with tillage rotation has significant importance in rainfed dryland agriculture however the effects of tillage rotations on crop yield and soil conditions have primarily focused on short term experiments 2 5 years in this area and the results were not consistent with previous studies hou et al 2012 nie et al 2015 zhu et al 2015 relevant long term experiments on tillage rotation with fertilization are limited with proper fertilization tillage rotation may couple soil water and nutrients rationally and function more effectively and economically in addition the effects of conservation tillage rotation and fertilization on soil water and crop yield is a long and sustainable process and these effects are site and climate dependent xie et al 2016 therefore determination of an appropriate tillage rotation system with fertilization is essential for crop production on the loess plateau hence a long term experiment ten years conducted in heyang shaanxi province china was established to study soil water use and crop yield in a spring maize winter wheat fallow rotation field over a two year period our objectives were to study the soil water conservation effect in fallow periods soil water use during growth periods and crop yield variation in rainfed fields and to select an optimal tillage rotation with fertilization for crop production on the loess plateau 2 methods 2 1 study site description the field experiment has been conducted since 2007 at the dryland agricultural research station of northwest a f university which is located in ganjing 35 19 n 106 4 e heyang county shaanxi province china the research station was located on the loess plateau which is characterized by a temperate semi arid continental monsoon climate at an altitude of 877 m the annual mean temperature and evaporation were 11 5 c and 1833 mm respectively during the last 30 years the annual mean precipitation was 526 mm the data derived from heyang weather station the annual precipitation displayed an uneven characteristic 60 of which mainly occurred in the summer season july august and september that deviated from the winter wheat growth season the climate details for this experiment are shown in fig 1 before the experiment continuous spring maize was planted and conventional tillage with crop residue removal or burning was applied every year after crop harvest the field experiment was conducted on level terrain with dark loessial soil which is a typical soil type in the loess plateau and it is classified as middle loam soil based on the fao unesco soil classification 1993 the soil properties and nutrient conditions at a soil depth of 0 60 cm before this experiment started in 2007 are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental design and treatments the field experiment was designed with three fertilizations balanced fertilization bf low fertilization lf and conventional fertilization cf as the main treatments and was spilt into four tillage practices no tillage rotated with subsoiling annually ns subsoiling rotated with conventional tillage annually sc conventional tillage rotated with no tillage annually cn and continuous conventional tillage ct as sub treatments each sub plot was 5 m wide and 22 5 m long 112 5 m2 with a 60 cm interval between plots these three fertilization and four tillage practices were combined into twelve fertilization with tillage rotation systems table 2 bns bf ns bsc bf sc bcn bf cn bct bf ct lns lf ns lsc lf sc lcn lf cn lct lf ct cns cf ns csc cf sc ccn cf cn cct cf ct the fertilizers were spread evenly on the soil surface before sowing the fertilizers for n were urea and diammonium phosphate the fertilizer for p2o5 was diammonium phosphate the fertilizer for p2o5 was potassium chloride for the balanced fertilization bf 150 kg n ha 1 120 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 90 kg k2o ha 1 were applied to the soil before sowing each year for the low fertilization lf 75 kg n ha 1 60 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 45 kg k2o ha 1 were applied to the soil before sowing for the conventional fertilization cf 255 kg n ha 1 and 180 kg p2o5 ha 1 were applied to the soil before sowing each year the soil in the loess plateau is rich in potassium k and the soil total k is relatively high so farmers generally apply fertilizers without potassium conventional fertilization cf was determined according to the mean fertilization level of the local farmers balanced fertilization bf was applied at the recommended rate determined by the local soil nutrient conditions and adequate nutrient ratios of crop production the fertilizer rate of low fertilization lf was one half that of balanced fertilization ns treatment means no tillage applied in the first year and rotated with subsoiling in the second year and the following years would replicate the rotation in the first and second year by sequence sc treatment means subsoiling applied in the first year and rotated with conventional tillage in the second year and the following years would replicate the rotation in the first and second year by sequence cn treatment means conventional tillage applied in the first year and rotated with no tillage in the second year and the following years would replicate the rotation in the first and second year by sequence ct treatment means conventional tillage applied each year for the no tillage practice the crop straw was chopped and spread evenly on the surface of the experimental plots after the harvest of the previous crop using a combine harvester for the subsoiling practice the crop straw was left on the soil surface as mulch and the soil was then subsoiled to a depth of 30 35 cm with an interval of 60 cm by a subsoiler with adjustable wings the surface soil had little disturbance with the subsoiling all tillage practices were applied after the crop harvests for the conventional tillage practice the crop straw was incorporated into the soil layer and plowed to a depth of 22 25 cm for all tillage practices there was a one time herbicide spray in the fallow period and no other soil disturbance or management was applied before sowing to produce a good soil condition for crop emergence and improve the effect of fertilizers rotary tillage was applied at crop sowing one time each year the cultivated varieties of winter wheat were jinmai 47 in 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 and 2013 2014 and chang 6359 in 2015 2016 table 3 the cultivated varieties of spring maize were yuyu 22 in 2009 2011 and 2013 and zhengdan 958 in 2015 winter wheat and spring maize were sown at a density of 3 3 million plants ha 1 and 60 thousand plants ha 1 respectively the row spaces for winter wheat and spring maize were 0 2 m and 0 6 m respectively the operation of tillage practices and crop planting details are shown in fig 2 and table 3 2 3 measurements the gravimetric water content was multiplied by the soil bulk density which measured every year after crop harvest to obtain the volumetric water content soil water storage was calculated for a 2 0 m profile by multiplying the mean soil volumetric water content by soil profile depth the soil moisture storage was measured using a 5 cm soil auger at 20 cm increments to a depth of 200 cm with three replications in all experimental plots every month the soil water content was determined using the oven drying method the crop yield was determined by manual harvesting threshing and air drying grain from three 3 m2 and 9 m2 areas selected at random in each plot for winter wheat and spring maize respectively the requisite indices were calculated according to the following formulae 1 swc wet soil weight dried soil weight 100 dried soil weight 2 soil water storage mm swci di hi 3 et w1 w2 p note in loess plateau the soil has deep loess soil layer that has good soil water

difference between sc rotation and ct was not significant in the first experimental year of 2008 the difference among tillage practices was not significant and the difference was primarily due to fertilization fig 3 in subsequent years differences occurred and ccn 5440 kg ha 1 and lsc 3799 kg ha 1 produced the highest and lowest average wheat yield in ten years respectively cns bns bsc and bcn

maize growth seasons the difference among fertilization and tillage systems was significant bns 8415 kg ha 1 and lct 6849 kg ha 1 produced the highest and lowest average maize yield in four years bsc bcn bct cns and ccn had nearly the same level of maize yield as bns fig 4 in the rainy growth seasons of 2009 and 2011 the maize yield was quite different among treatments in the dry growth seasons of

fallow periods lns 419 mm and lcn 412 mm always showed better soil water conditions at the end of the fallow period p 0 05 fig 6 a after a spring maize winter wheat rotation the soil water storage was relatively low at the beginning of the fallow period with the arrival of the rainy season july august and september the water storage increased significantly and the difference between fertilization and tillage treatments was significant p 0 05 fig 6b following a dry winter season and evaporation the soil water storage decreased and this difference declined 3 4 soil water variation during crop growth to further explore the soil water use and redistribution of spring maize winter wheat rotation the total soil water storage in 0 2 m at important crop growth stages was studied fig 7 3 4 1 winter wheat during growth season of winter wheat the soil water storage declined persistently with the wheat growth fig 7 the sowing time mean value 435 mm performed the highest soil water storage and consumed nearly 33 6 of that when it harvested mean value 289 mm from jointing stage to filling time the soil water storage declined sharply that due to the fast growth of winter wheat differences among different fertilization with tillage systems were significant p 0 05 and lns mean value 381 mm showed better soil water storage through the whole wheat growth season while bct mean value 348 mm showed less soil water storage 3 4 2 spring maize unlike the soil water dynamics of winter wheat the soil water storage of spring maize at sowing stage mean value 404 mm and harvest time mean value 415 mm keep on the same level fig 7 at seedling stage soil water storage increased that due to the more precipitation at summer season june july august from seedling to filling stage soil water storage declined sharply which due to the high evaporation in summer season and emergency requirement for crop growth but the crop consumed little soil water when it finished filling with the rainy season at august the soil water increased from filling stage to harvest time during maize growth season differences among different fertilization with tillage systems were significant p 0 05 and lns mean value 410 mm showed better soil water storage through the whole wheat growth season while bct mean value 391 mm showed less soil water storage 3 5 wue 3 5 1 winter wheat the wue of winter wheat

conservation in rainfed areas crop yield depended on soil water storage at sowing and effective precipitation during the crop growth season meng et al 2012 sang et al 2016 this demonstrated that soil water at sowing time plays an important role in crop production in dryland agriculture in this study there was a long term fallow period from late june after the winter wheat harvest to late april before maize sowing the following year followed by a consecutive spring maize and winter wheat rotation growth season thus better soil water conservation in the fallow period would provide a better soil condition for the subsequent production of maize and wheat due to the better rainfall capture and soil water conservation effect of straw mulching in no tillage giller et al 2009 ns and cn rotations provided higher soil water storage in the fallow period in addition tillage rotations that enhanced the soil physical properties also promoted soil water movement that led to better soil water conditions in the deep soil hou et al 2012 sang et al 2016 as a result of the combination of bare soil surface and intensive evaporation of ct sc and ct resulted in low soil water storage moreover the better soil texture and aeration of tillage rotation may cause more evaporation and lead to lower soil water in sc than ct although et of different tillage rotations and fertilizations had no significant effect in ten years cf and ct showed a higher average et than other treatments this would result in lower soil water storage in long term crop production in agreement with a previous study on the loess plateau zhang et al 2015b high fertilization would consume more soil water and lead to less soil water than low fertilization moreover crop rotation and the significant interaction of fertilization and tillage rotation also would affect the soil water storage in this study this needs to be further explored in the future 4 2 soil water use a good soil water condition is the basis for obtaining a high and sustainable crop yield yan et al 2002 especially in the critical growth period the sharp decline of soil water from the heading stage to the filling stage illustrated the importance of soil water at a critical stage despite the special case in the filling stage of spring maize the soil water conditions of ns and cn showed better soil water conditions in the entire winter wheat spring maize growth season especially in deep soil layers this may be attributed to the better soil water condition in the fallow period and soil water movement of tillage rotations the higher soil water storage in the fallow period provided a better soil water condition for maize sowing in ns and cn rotations in the following maize growth season straw mulching reduced evaporation on the soil surface and produced more effective soil water for crop growth zhao et al 2014 in addition tillage rotations improved the soil structure promoted the growth of roots and fully utilized the soil water in the surface and deep soil layers nie et al 2015 zhu et al 2015 this led to better soil water conditions and high wues during the maize growth season in ns and cn rotations the different soil water distribution at the maize filling stage and the lower difference among tillage systems from sowing time to filling stage was also due to the water use of tillage rotations and the special crop rotation in this study unlike our prediction initially intensive soil water consumption did not affect subsequent wheat growth the high rainfall at maize harvest time restored the soil water rapidly and ensured good soil water conditions for wheat especially in ns and cn rotations the better soil structure and water movement provided better soil water in the deep soil layer hou et al 2012 sun et al 2010 in contrast to spring maize the soil water in the wheat growth season was greatly diminished however the long term fallow period followed by the wheat growth season can replenish the soil water and provide good soil water conditions for the following crop rotation cycle this is an advantage of wheat maize rotation this typical rotation can restore soil water seasonably and provide sufficient soil water for crop growth furthermore the long term fallow period in this rotation provided sufficient time for the decomposition of crop residue and enhanced soil properties for crop growth surprisingly with straw mulching tillage rotations did not significantly decrease et during this crop rotation however water was utilized effectively and increased the wue this does not agree with previous studies on the loess plateau wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2015a b previous studies showed that tillage rotations have a significant effect on et the different results may be due to the typical benefits brought by crop and tillage rotations in this study no tillage with straw mulching reduced evaporation on the soil surface wang et al 2012a b but subsoiling promoted soil water depletion on roots in deep soil layers cai et al 2014 moreover the typical crop rotation also affected crop growth and water use this should be further studied regarding fertilization et was not significant but the higher et during crop growth season and low soil water storage in fallow period in cf that would exaggerate the difference of soil water storage among different fertilization treatments zhang et al 2015b 4 3 crop yield increase due to the coordination and interaction of tillage rotations and fertilization the highest average crop yield was observed in bns and was followed by bcn in this study the reasonable colocalization of soil water and soil nutrients provided a better crop growth condition for obtaining high crop yields in bf meng et al 2012 excessive fertilization causes no significant increase in crop yield but the soil water would decrease liu et al 2013 zhang et al 2015b additional fertilizer input would cause low fertilizer efficiency unused

enhancing each component liu et al 2013 although the soil in the loess plateau is rich in k it does not facilitate long term high crop production a balanced n p and k treatment would improve the crop yield and avoid further deterioration of soil fertility the absence of least one major nutrient i e either n p or k would cause a specific nutrient deficiency stress and retard crop growth with a concomitant reduction in yield yousaf et al 2017 thus the lack of k in cf limited the positive effect of n and p on crop yield yousaf et al 2017 the factors by which tillage practices influence crop growth are complex chen et al 2011 the changes in soil quality such as soil moisture soil temperature and soil nutrient availability have all been considered as the dominant reasons for crop yield differences among tillage practices soane et al 2012 ns and cn provide favorable water during the crop growth season and st loosens soil structure zhang et al 2017 this promotes soil water movement and crop root growth in the deep soil layer liu et al 2015 the interaction of water and balanced soil nutrients eventually increases crop yield optimized or balanced fertilization with proper tillage

irrigation at the jointing stage significantly increased the gy in w during both growing seasons 4 discussion flag leaves are the main component of the canopy during the late growth stage of winter wheat and more than 60 of the grain dry matter comes from the photosynthetic carbon substrate assimilation by flag leaves gao et al 2018 chlorophyll molecules are an important part of photosynthesis and electron transport reactions during photosynthesis as they regulate the absorption transformation and distribution of light eppley and sloan 2010 an increase in the flag leaf area may lead to a reduction in the total chlorophyll content austin et al 1982 in this study the cci at the filling stage in the ci1 treatment was significantly higher than that in the ci2 treatment photoinhibition and photodamage of the pigment and pigment protein complexes caused by drought and instability of the photosynthetic membranes lead to a decrease in the chlorophyll content the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters are important for the breeding of drought resistant varieties because water can regulate a favorable gene expression for maximum photochemical efficiency bai et al 2011 a decrease in fv fm indicates a decrease in the excitation energy for capture and conversion in the psii reaction center resulting in a decreased psii photochemical efficiency the photosynthetic activity of winter wheat flag leaves increased at the seedling and jointing stages due to drought resulting in a higher gy kang et al 2002 the decrease in fv fm was consistent with the decrease in the chlorophyll index of each genotype under the combined action of drought and high temperature urban et al 2018 dong et al 2014 showed that irrigation and planting patterns had significant effects on the fv fm of wheat leaf chlorophyll fluorescence parameter in psii and the irrigation effect was significantly greater than the planting pattern effect irrigation and ditching can maintain high fv fm values in post anthesis flag leaves improve the psii activity in flag leaves of post anthesis wheat slow down the degree of photoinhibition and senescence of leaves and increase the pn and gy in this study delayed irrigation at the jointing stage increased the cci in flag leaves during the late growth stage and delayed the degradation of flag leaf chlorophyll furthermore it significantly prolonged the aging period of wheat producing more photosynthetic products and increasing the gy due to insufficient water availability the crop productivity and yield are limited by insufficient levels of photosynthesis mokhtar et al 2009 winter wheat maintains a high pn for a long time which is beneficial for full grain filling and ultimately the yield zhang et al 2000 the pn directly expresses the photosynthetic capacity of a single leaf tr indicates the transpiration intensity of plants wue is an important ecological and physiological factor affecting pn under field growth conditions li et al 2002 and wuel is the intrinsic wue under mild drought conditions photosynthesis decreased slightly after flowering which not only promoted the translocation of pre flowering assimilates and grains but also increased the accumulation of photosynthetic products thus promoting the translocation of photosynthetic products and increasing the gy in this study the results for pn were consistent with those of tr and both quantities reached the maximum during the flowering stage the effect of planting pattern on pn and tr exceeded that of irrigation and the pn and tr were significantly higher in w than in c the wuel at the filling stage showed the greatest value in the wi2 treatment which was significantly higher than the values for other treatments the wue is closely related to photosynthetic activity and transpiration efficiency while the transpiration efficiency in turn is affected by irrigation monneveux et al 2006 the likely reason for the increase in pn during the flowering stage is that 60 mm irrigation at the jointing stage resulted in an increase of co2 in the flag leaves which increased the availability of the carbon source for photosynthesis reduced the limitation of stomatal photosynthesis and increased the net pn li et al 2011 ma et al 2015 appropriate moisture control before winter wheat jointing can control excessive vegetative growth promote the distribution of photosynthetic products to the roots increase the tillering and improve the canopy structure the light capture and light energy utilization efficiency are directly affected by the canopy structure canopy structure optimization is the basis for improving the crop photosynthetic efficiency and obtaining a high yield stewart et al 2003 de bruin and pedersen 2008 giunta et al 2008 yu et al 1998 suggested that the effect of canopy light distribution on photosynthesis was greater than that of other factors zhao et al 2013 showed that both irrigation and planting patterns had a significant effect on the winter wheat canopy structure translating to an improved photosynthetically active radiation capture ratio for the above reasons in this study delayed irrigation at the jointing stage improved the fv fm of psii improved the photosynthetic capacity and wue and increased the kernel numbers per spike in this study we only measured the pn tr and wuel in the flag leaves in future studies the effects of delayed irrigation at the winter wheat jointing stage and planting patterns on the canopy photosynthetic characteristics such as light capturing ability and light energy utilization efficiency should also be studied in addition to the gy the grain quality is also a crucial research topic for the ncp on the other hand only one winter wheat variety was tested in this study and there are many different varieties developed in the ncp for this reason different winter wheat varieties may show different responses to the different planting patterns and delayed irrigation at the jointing stage this topic requires further exploration 5 conclusion delayed irrigation at the jointing stage and the planting patterns significantly affected the flag leaf fluorescence parameters of winter wheat the increase in the psii fv fm upon treatment with wi2 which was beneficial for the psii photoreaction in flag leaves in addition to improving the photosynthetic capacity and wue resulted in an increased gy given the improvement in wuel and gy the combination of delayed irrigation at the jointing stage and w is potentially a suitable water saving planting method for winter wheat croplands in the ncp acknowledgements supported in part by the national nature science foundation of china 31571603 and funds of shandong double tops program

yield and yield components at the maturity stage of winter wheat the spike numbers and gy were measured in 1 5 m double rows with uniform growth except for the three lines on the side in each plot in addition 20 representative plants were selected consecutively in each row and the kernel numbers per spike and 1000 grain weight were examined in the laboratory 2 5 statistical analysis the statistical analysis system of microsoft excel 2010 and dps data processing system were adopted and the significance was assessed using the least significant difference lsd method 3 results 3 1 chlorophyll content index cci the effects of different treatments on the cci of winter wheat are shown in table 1 at the heading stage the cci for wi2 treatment was significantly higher than that of wi1 treatment by 4 94 and 6 56 during 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 respectively during 2015 2016 the cci at flowering stage for the ci1 treatment was significantly higher than that of the ci2 treatment by 16 99 and that of the wi2 treatment was significantly higher than that of the wi1 treatment by 6 78 there was no significant difference between treatments during 2016 2017 at the heading and flowering stages delayed irrigation at the jointing stage reduced the cci in c whereas it increased the cci in w in both the growing seasons the cci during the filling stage for w was significantly higher than that of c by 4 87 and 7 94 and that of i2 was significantly higher than that of i1 by 6 71 and 4 20 respectively during the two year study period the highest value of cci was observed in the wi2 treatment the cci for wi2 treatment was higher than that of the ci1 ci2 and wi1 treatments by 11 73 7 57 and 9 42 during the first growing season and by 12 38 9 02 and 5 23 during the second growing season respectively 3 2 chlorophyll ﬂuorescence parameters the fv fm of the flag leaf photosystem ii psii during the winter wheat growth stages is shown in table 2 in both the growing seasons except for the flowering stage in 2015 2016 the fv fm for w was significantly higher than that of c during the first growing season the fv fm for i2 was significantly higher than that of i1 during the second growing season the fv fm for i2 was significantly higher than that of i1 only at the filling stage in both growing seasons at the filling stages the fv fm was significantly higher in the wi2 treatment than in the ci1 and ci2 treatments 3 3 photosynthetic characteristics the effects of different treatments on the photosynthetic characteristics of winter wheat flag leaves are shown in fig 2 during both the growing seasons from the heading through the filling stage the pn of flag leaves first increased and then decreased at the heading stage the pn for the wi1 treatment was 8 07 and 5 90 higher than that of the ci1 treatment and the pn for the wi2 treatment was 15 13 and 4 40 higher than that of the ci2 treatment during 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 respectively the pn of flag leaves reached the maximum value at the flowering stage after the flowering stage the pn began to decrease at the filling stage the pn was higher in the wi2 than in the ci1 ci2 and wi1 treatments by 14 14 12 46 and 4 35 during the first growing season and by 36 48 24 04 and 10 42 during the second growing season respectively the trend in tr values for winter wheat flag leaves was consistent with the trend for pn which was the highest at the flowering stage at the heading stage the tr was significantly higher in the wi1 treatment than in the ci1 treatment by 6 99 and 3 28 and significantly higher in the wi2 treatment than in the ci2 treatment by 7 19 and 2 37 during the first and second growing seasons respectively at the flowering stage the tr was significantly higher in wi2 than in ci1 ci2 and wi1

wi1 treatment than in the ci1 treatment by 4 58 and 4 88 and significantly higher in the wi2 treatment than in the ci2 treatment by 7 27 and 2 81 during the first and second growing seasons respectively during both the heading and flowering stages the difference in wuel was not significant between any two treatments however at the filling stage the wuel was significantly higher in the wi2 treatment than in the ci1 ci2 and wi1 treatments by 3 77 4 76 and 1 23 during the first growing season and by 28 76 20 49 and 9 44 during the second growing season respectively 3 4 grain yield and yield components the gy and yield component data of winter wheat are shown in table 3 the spike numbers for w were significantly higher than that of c by 18 51 and 9 51 during 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 respectively however the spike numbers in i1 and i2 did not reach a significant difference in either of the growing seasons the spike numbers for wi2 were significantly higher than that of the wi1 treatment by 5 60 and 2 96 during the first and second growing seasons respectively the kernel numbers per spike were significantly higher in w than in c by 4 12 and 6 93 during the first and second growing seasons respectively and the kernel numbers per spike were significantly higher in the i2 than in the i1 by 2 77 and 1 17 during the first and second growing seasons respectively the kernel numbers per spike were significantly higher in the ci2 treatment than in the ci1 treatment by 3 12 during the first growing season however during the second growing season the kernel numbers per spike were significantly lower in the ci2 treatment than in the ci1 treatment by 2 65 the kernel numbers per spike in the wi2 treatment were significantly higher than that in the wi1 treatment by 2 45 and 4 88 during the first and second growing seasons respectively the 1000 grain weight did not yield a significant difference between any two treatments delayed irrigation at the jointing stage significantly increased the spike numbers as well as the kernel numbers per spike in w during both growing seasons the highest gy was observed in the wi2 treatment the gy was significantly higher in the wi2 treatment than in the ci1 ci2 and wi1 treatments by 12 28 6 01 and 1 65 during the first growing season and by 12 99 11 93 and 4 20 during the second growing season respectively delayed irrigation at the jointing stage significantly increased the gy in w during both growing seasons 4 discussion flag leaves are the main component of the canopy during the late growth stage of winter wheat and more than 60 of the grain dry matter comes from the photosynthetic carbon substrate assimilation by flag leaves gao et al 2018 chlorophyll molecules are an important part of photosynthesis and electron transport reactions during photosynthesis as they regulate the absorption transformation and distribution of light eppley and sloan 2010 an increase in the flag leaf area may lead to a reduction in the total chlorophyll content austin et al 1982 in this study the cci at the filling stage in the ci1 treatment was significantly higher than that in the ci2 treatment photoinhibition and photodamage of the pigment and pigment protein complexes caused by drought and instability of the photosynthetic membranes lead to a decrease in the chlorophyll content the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters are important for the breeding of drought resistant varieties because water can regulate a favorable gene expression for maximum photochemical efficiency bai et al 2011 a decrease in fv fm indicates a decrease in the excitation energy for capture and conversion in the psii reaction center resulting in a decreased psii photochemical efficiency the photosynthetic activity of winter wheat flag leaves increased at the seedling and jointing stages due to drought resulting in a higher gy kang et al 2002 the decrease in fv fm was consistent with the decrease in the chlorophyll index of each genotype under the combined action of drought and high temperature urban et al 2018 dong et al 2014 showed that irrigation and planting patterns had significant effects on the fv fm of wheat leaf chlorophyll fluorescence parameter in psii and the irrigation effect was significantly greater than the planting pattern effect irrigation and ditching can maintain high fv fm values in post anthesis flag leaves improve the psii activity in flag leaves of post anthesis wheat slow down the degree of photoinhibition and senescence of leaves and increase the pn and gy in this study delayed irrigation at the jointing stage increased the cci in flag leaves during the late growth stage and delayed the degradation of flag leaf chlorophyll furthermore it significantly prolonged the aging period of wheat producing more photosynthetic products and increasing the gy due to insufficient water availability the crop productivity and yield are limited by insufficient levels of photosynthesis mokhtar et al 2009 winter wheat maintains a high pn for a long time which is beneficial for full grain filling and ultimately the yield zhang et al 2000 the pn directly expresses the photosynthetic capacity of a single leaf tr indicates the transpiration intensity of plants wue is an important ecological and physiological factor affecting pn under field growth conditions li et al 2002 and wuel is the intrinsic wue under mild drought conditions photosynthesis decreased slightly after flowering which not only promoted the translocation of pre flowering assimilates and grains but also increased the accumulation of photosynthetic products thus promoting the translocation of photosynthetic products and increasing the gy in this study the results for pn were consistent with those of tr and both quantities reached the maximum during the flowering stage the effect of planting pattern on pn and tr exceeded that of irrigation and the pn and tr were significantly higher in w than in c the wuel at the filling stage showed the greatest value in the wi2 treatment which was significantly higher than the values for other treatments the wue is closely related to photosynthetic activity and transpiration efficiency while the transpiration efficiency in turn is affected by irrigation monneveux et al 2006 the likely reason for the increase in pn during the flowering stage is that 60 mm irrigation at the jointing stage resulted in an increase of co2 in the flag leaves which increased the availability of the carbon source for photosynthesis reduced the limitation of stomatal photosynthesis and increased the net pn li et al 2011 ma et al 2015 appropriate moisture control before winter wheat jointing can control excessive vegetative growth promote the distribution of photosynthetic products to the roots increase the tillering and improve the canopy structure the light capture and light energy utilization efficiency are directly affected by the canopy structure canopy structure optimization is the basis for improving the crop photosynthetic efficiency and obtaining a high yield stewart et al 2003 de bruin and pedersen 2008 giunta et al 2008 yu et al 1998 suggested that the effect of canopy light distribution on photosynthesis was greater than that of other factors zhao et al 2013 showed that both irrigation and planting patterns had a significant effect on the winter wheat canopy structure translating to an improved photosynthetically active radiation capture ratio for the above reasons in this study delayed irrigation at the jointing stage improved the fv fm of psii improved the photosynthetic capacity and wue and increased the kernel numbers per spike in this study we only measured the pn tr and wuel in the flag leaves in future studies the effects of delayed irrigation at the winter wheat jointing stage and planting patterns on the canopy photosynthetic characteristics such as light capturing ability and light energy utilization efficiency should also be studied in addition to the gy the grain quality is also a crucial research topic for the ncp on the other hand only one winter wheat variety was tested in this study and there are many different varieties developed in the ncp for this reason different winter wheat varieties may show different responses to the different planting patterns and delayed irrigation at the jointing stage this topic requires further exploration 5 conclusion delayed irrigation at the jointing stage and the planting patterns significantly affected the flag leaf fluorescence parameters of winter wheat the increase in the psii fv fm upon treatment with wi2 which was beneficial for the psii photoreaction in flag leaves in addition to improving the photosynthetic capacity and wue resulted in an increased gy given the improvement in wuel and gy the combination of delayed irrigation at the jointing stage and w is potentially a suitable water

11008,oil palm eleais guineensisjacq production in west africa is limited by poor soils and suboptimal climate the potential to improve fruit bunch fb yields with appropriate water and nutrient management in ghana is thus considerable to assess the effects of water and nutrient management on oil palm yields a 2 x 2 factorial randomized complete block design with irrigation and fertilizer was implemented for three years in the main oil palm production area of western region ghana treatments included i zero irrigation zero fertilizer control ii zero irrigation fertilizer iii irrigation zero fertilizer and iv irrigation fertilizer all replicated four times fertilized treatments received annual nutrient application rates of 2 0 kg palm 1 nitrogen n 0 4 kg palm 1 phosphorus p 2 5 kg palm 1 potassium k 0 3 kg palm 1 magnesium mg and 0 15 kg palm 1 boron b irrigation using sprinklers was scheduled using tensiometers and was given to meet the daily evaporation of oil palm 450 l palm 1 day 1 or 6 5 mm day 1 average attainable yields of 32 6 t ha 1 fb were achieved with irrigation and fertilizer which was 4 7 t ha 1 greater than the control 27 9 t ha 1 and 4 1 t ha 1 greater than with irrigation alone 28 5 t ha 1 fertilizer was therefore essential for a maximum response to irrigation whilst yield increases were mostly attributed to increases in bunch number large variations in monthly yield persisted at all treatments despite the use of irrigation with production peaks typically coninciding with the onset of the long rain season march july whilst a number of factors may contribute e g vapour pressure deficit the process es regulating yield cycles remain unclear and require further research keywords irrigation fertilizer water deficit yield cycle yield gap 1 introduction although oil palm eleais guineensis jacq is indigenous to west africa the soils and climatic conditions in the region are considered suboptimal for its cultivation rhebergen et al 2016 in southern ghana soils are predominately coarse textured strongly weathered and highly leached acrisols and ferralsols usda ultisols and oxisols respectively with low ph and poor soil fertility status buringh 1979 the major climatic constraint is the prolonged dry season of 4 5 months with mean annual water deficits up to 600 mm yr 1 rhebergen et al 2016 van der vossen 1969 a recent land suitability assessment showed that large areas within the oil palm belt of ghana are susceptible to annual water deficits approaching 400 mm rhebergen et al 2016 there is a time lag of 35 40 months between the occurrence of abiotic and biotic stress events and yield response in oil palm which makes it difficult to unravel the effects of environmental factors on fruit bunch fb yield breure 2003 corley and tinker 2016 several authors have attempted to explain yield responses in relation to the annual water deficit in west africa for example hartley 1988 reported a 10 yield reduction with every 100 mm of annual water deficit caliman and southworth 1998 observed that moisture stress negatively affected floral initiation 1 3 sex differentiation 3 4 and abortion rate 8 10 per 100 mm of deficit with a concomitant yield reduction of 8 10 per 100 mm deficit in the first year and 3 4 in the second a yield reduction of 40 50 was recorded when severe water stress occurred in the previous year in côte d ivoire olivin 1968 reported a yield reduction of 10 20 with 100 mm annual water deficit depending on the soils water storage capacity while ochs and daniel 1976 reported similar yield penalties based on observations made in the ivory coast benin and cameroon in ghana yields ranged from 22 25 t ha 1 fb for areas with annual water deficits of 150 mm 16 18 t ha 1 fb for areas with annual water deficits of 250 mm and 6 7 t ha 1 fb for areas with an annual water deficit of 400 mm suggesting an almost linear relationship between yield and water deficit danso et al 2008 therefore there are strong prospects for reducing the negative impact of moisture stress on yields in ghana supplementary water supply through irrigation provides an opportunity to increase oil palm yields in regions with sub optimal rainfall corley and hong 1982 prioux et al 1992 obtained maximum yields of 22 t ha 1 fb with irrigation in ivory coast a 21 increase in production over non irrigated palms while yields increased four fold with irrigation in a trial described by desmarest 1967 in addition to moisture stress oil palm yields in ghana are limited by poor soil fertility and inadequate nutrient supply rhebergen et al 2018 analysis of soil and plant samples from trial sites in ghana showed severe and widespread deficiencies of soil phosphorus p and potassium k on large plantations and smallholder farms rhebergen et al 2018 in addition several trials in west africa confirmed that k is deficient on sedimentary soils p on basement complex derived soils and that mg may be needed on acid sandy soils corley and tinker 2016 the potential to improve oil palm production with appropriate water and nutrient management in ghana is thus substantial and could greatly increase profitability for oil palm producers as well as sparing land for nature in this paper we evaluated the interaction of irrigation and nutrient application on the yield of oil palm on a large scale oil palm plantation over three years in western region ghana the objectives were i to quantify yield gaps caused by water and nutrient constraints and ii to analyse the interaction of water and nutrients on yield trends and yield components 2 methods 2 1 study area a trial was established to assess the effects of irrigation and fertilizer on oil palm yields at the norpalm ghana ltd plantation ngl 4 55 29 04 n 1 53 31 75 w 11 masl which is located in the ahanta west district of the western region ghana ngl s nucleus estate consists of approximately 4 500 ha distributed between the sese 500 ha and pretsea 4 000 ha sites fig 1 slopes at ngl are gentle to hilly 4 40 and soils are classified as gleysols in poorly drained valley bottoms and flood plains and lixisols on sloping terrain fig 1 rainfall at ngl is bimodal with long rains from march july and short rains from september november average rainfall from 2011 to 2016 was lower at the sese site 1 136 mm than at pretsea 1 511 mm with considerable variability between months and years as a result the average annual water deficit calculated using the method of surre 1968 over the same period was higher at sese 608 mm than in pretsea 355 mm fig 2 2 2 trial setup and management the trial was established at the sese plantation on february 2015 in a 34 ha block that had been planted in 2002 fig 1 the trial block was planted at 143 palms ha 1 using triangular spacing and consisted entirely of tenera i e dura x pisifera dxp palms of pobé benin material which had been planted 13 years before at the time of trial establishment the topography was flat an isometric map of the trial block was produced including the number of mature immature new supply abnormal and dead removed palms or unplantable points and was used to delineate the trial plots each plot consisted of clusters of 36 palms 6 6 of which the inner 16 palms 4 4 were used for taking measurements recording palms and the outer palms provided a guard row fig 3 the recording palms consisted entirely of productive and healthy palms while the guard row included some abnormal and immature palms each recording plot 4 4 was approximately 0 11 ha all plots were bounded by a trench of at least 50 cm deep to avoid nutrient and water movement between trial plots and access from bordering palms at least two palm rows were also kept as a buffer between plots the entire trial block was managed with best management practices bmp donough et al 2009 to ensure that yields were not constrained by other factors besides nutrients and water 2 3 experimental design the trial was established at the sese plantation division because of its proximity to a river for irrigation the trial was designed to quantify the bunch yield potential yp without moisture stress and to investigate the interaction of nutrient and water supply on oil palm yield components a 2 2 factorial randomized complete block design was used which included four treatments i zero irrigation zero fertilizer i0f0 i e control ii zero irrigation fertilizer i0f1 iii irrigation zero fertilizer i1f0 and iv irrigation fertilizer i1f1 each treatment was replicated four times with blocks following moisture gradients in total 16 plots were installed fig 3 fertilizer treatments covered the main limiting nutrients nitrogen n phosphorus p potassium k and magnesium mg applied as urea triple superphosphate tsp muriate of potash mop and kieserite respectively annual application rates ofnutrients elemental form were 2 0 kg palm 1 n 0 4 kg palm 1 p 2 5 kg palm 1 k and 0 3 kg palm 1 mg in addition all fertilizer treatment plots received an annual application of 0 15 kg palm 1 boron b to overcome b deficiency fertilizer application rates were based on previous fertilizer experiments and were drafted to ensure nutrients were not limiting fertilizers were applied to all palms in each fertilizer treatment plot including the guard row p k and mg fertilizers were broadcast over the edge of the weeded circle into the frond stack whilst b was applied as sodium borate in a band 1 m wide and 1 m from the palm trunk and urea in the weeded circle to reduce volatilization losses all fertilizers were applied during the rainy seasons sodium borate was applied in march urea in april and august mop in may and september tsp in june and kieserite in july fertilizer application rates and timing followed the same schedule each year and no mill residues e g empty fruit bunches efb were applied to the palms during the experiment irrigation needs were based on the soil water potential kpa which was measured using tensiometers in total four tensiometers were installed one in each block at 20 cm depth where most of the fine roots are located taillez 1971 all tensiometers were installed at the edge of the weeded circle at approximately 2 m from the palm trunk to maintain the soil as close as possible to field capacity at all times the critical soil water potential for irrigation was set at 20 kpa alam and rogers 1997 irrigated plots consisted of 12 sprinklers senninger smoothdrive each with a radius of 9 3 10 2 m each sprinkler thus covered three palms see insert fig 3 at an operating pressure of 207 kpa approximately 150 min of irrigation was given to meet the daily evaporation of oil palm 450 l palm 1 day 1 or 6 5 mm day 1 carr 2011 corley and tinker 2016 which was recorded during each irrigation event to ensure that the right quantity of water was supplied a flow meter was installed in line with the irrigation discharge pipe in order to evaluate the effect of irrigation in eliminating soil moisture stress we calculated the water balance for irrigated and non irrigated plots following the method of surre 1968 b s r e s p e t p where b monthly water balance mm sres residual soil water from the previous month mm p monthly rainfall mm and etp monthly potential evapotranspiration mm the monthly evapotranspiration etp of an oil palm field was estimated at 150 mm when there were 11 days on which measurable rainfall was recorded and at 120 mm for months with 11 rainfall days surre 1968 soil texture in the trial block was predominantly clay loam which has a maximum plant available water storage of about 150 mm per metre of soil depth saxton and rawls 2006 a soil depth of 1 m was taken since this is the zone exploited by the majority of oil palm roots nelson et al 2006 when b was 0 then that value was the water deficit and the initial soil moisture sres for the next month was zero where b was 150 mm but positive then that value was taken as the initial sres of the following month where b was 150 mm the sres of the following month was 150 mm we assumed that all excess water was lost as runoff or drainage to depth the annual water deﬁcit was calculated as the sum of all negative monthly water balances for the year for irrigated plots the water balance was calculated by adding the amount of irrigation mm to the monthly precipitation and the number of irrigation days to the number of rain days scorching of palm leaves was briefly experienced in the dry season in the first year due to tidal saline water incursions and a corrective measure was taken to use ec meters to monitor the salinity of the irrigation water at each irrigation event no irrigation was given when ec exceeded 3000 μs cm 1 to prevent scorching of the palm leaves and ground cover fipps 2003 piezometers were installed in eight plots two per replicate and monitored weekly to assess the groundwater level tensiometers were removed from the field during periods of flooding which occurred with heavy rainfall in march june and october 2016 and may and june 2017 2 4 data collection 2 4 1 crop production bunch number fruit bunch weight kg including loose fruits and number of male flowers were recorded at harvest intervals of 7 days at each plot crop production data were reported as the total for each plot inner 16 palms fruit bunch weight was measured with a tripod and digital scale and bunch production data was used to derive yield totals t ha 1 fb bunch number and the number of male flowers were used to determine the sex ratio i e the ratio of female to total inflorescences 2 4 2 leaf sampling palm nutritional status and fertilizer recommendations for mature oil palm are commonly made based on leaf and rachis nutrient concentrations from frond 17 due to their high correlation with yield fairhurst 1996 foster and prabowo 2006 leaf and rachis samples for nutrient determination were therefore taken annually at each recording palm inner 16 palms at a distance of approximately two thirds between the insertion point of the first true leaves on the leaf petiole and the distal end of frond 17 chapman and gray 1949 fairhurst et al 2004 composite leaf and rachis samples were produced for each plot and analysed at yara laboratory uk for n using a combustion analyser dumas technique and p k mg and b only leaf by inductively coupled plasma analyser icp with averages derived per treatment 2 4 3 physiological measurements physiological measurements were taken to investigate the effects of drought and water stress on oil palm development and production the following effects of drought or water stress on physiology and yields of oil palm are known to occur corley and hong 1982 i longer immature period

production peak carr 2011 viii bunch and early inflorescence abortion paramananthan 2003 and ix reduction in fruit bunch oil content ochs and daniel 1976 van der vossen 1974 physiological measurements included maturation time and number of unopened fronds and were carried out at weekly intervals on each individual recording palm inner 16 palms with averages derived per plot maturation time was measured as the time interval days between anthesis and harvesting ripeness all bunches were labelled with wire tags embedded in the flower to record the date and frond position at anthesis and at harvest newly emerging bunches were monitored routinely on each palm during each recording event crop production data including bunch number and the number of male flowers were used to determine the sex ratio and monthly yield distribution for each treatment 2 4 4 calculation of yield gaps we adjusted the yield gap model of rhebergen et al 2018 to include the nutrient limited yield yn because the trial was managed with bmp and only complete productive palm stands were used production level ymey the yield reduced by deficiencies in plantation establishment and yam the yield reduced by inadequate agronomic management were not included in the model the average yield achieved with i1f1 in year 3 served as a proxy for the potential yield yp the average yield with i0f1 in year 3 provided an estimate of oil palm production assuming optimal nutrient management and served as a proxy for the water limited yield yw while the i1f0 treatment served as a proxy for the yield limited by nutrients only yn and i0f0 for the water and nutrient limited yw n the difference between average yields achieved with yp and yw therefore gives us an estimate of the yield gap caused by water yield gap 1 yg1 and was calculated as y g 1 y p y w while nutrient limited yield gaps yield gap 2 yg2 were calculated as y g 2 y p y n the gap caused by both water and nutrient limitations yield gap 3 yg3 was calculated as the difference between yp and yw n y g 3 y p y w n 2 5 data analysis all data was summarized on an annual basis unless indicated differences between treatment means were analysed with a unianova for each year including yield components yield bunch weight and bunch number and leaf and rachis nutrient concentrations as dependent variables and replication and treatment as factors in oil palm there are three periods where production is sensitive to water stress caliman and southworth 1998 dufour et al 1988 i 30 33 months before harvesting which corresponds to the sex differentiation period ii 19 24 months before harvesting which corresponds to the fast growth of the leaf supporting the inflorescence and iii 7 13 months before harvesting which corresponds to the period of abortion for each water stress sensitive period we used simple linear regression with fruit bunch yield as the dependent variable and the water balance as the independent variable to determine which months were most significant in predicting yield for each treatment we then entered the most significant months in a multiple linear regression model for each treatment and removed the variables that did not make a significant p 0 05 contribution to the regression all statistics were performed using ibm spss statistics version 24 3 results 3 1 yield components the pre trial annual yield was 17 7 ha 1 fb across the whole block in year 1 average fb yields were 6 9 t ha 1 greater at 24 6 t ha 1 in the control treatment i0f0 compared with 7 0 t ha 1 greater in the i0f1 treatment 24 7 t ha 1 6 3 t ha 1 in the i1f0 24 0 t ha 1 and 6 6 t ha 1 larger in the i1f1 treatment 24 3 t ha 1 table 1 we attribute the larger yields in year 1 to the fact that trial plots consisted entirely of productive palms as well as improved crop management including more frequent and complete harvesting events average fb yields increased in year 2 and 3 with the i1f1 treatment yielding significantly more than other treatments at 32 6 t ha 1 the large fb yield increase with i1f1 suggests that there was a significant irrigation x fertilizer interaction average bunch weight abw kg decreased with each year for all treatments whilst bunch number per palm bn increased the increase was largest for the i1f1 treatment where bunch number increased from 7 5 11 1 bunches palm 1 48 bunch number per palm depends on the frond production rate the sex ratio the abortion rate and the bunch failure rate carr 2011 the increase in bunch number coincided with a decrease in the number of male flowers and an increase in the sex ratio for all treatments table 1 whilst increases in bunch number with irrigation are mostly due to changes in both abortion rate and sex ratio corley and hong 1982 monthly yield components fluctuated widely for all treatments with most notably the clear seasonality in bunch number fig 4 in mature palms variation in bunch number contibutes much more to yield cycles than does bunch weight with sex variation commonly regarded as the prime cause of yield variation corley and tinker 2016 henson and dolmat 2004 in regions with high and regular rainfall e g parts of north sumatra indonesia and sabah malaysia sex ratios tend to vary little throughout the year whilst in areas with a marked dry season west africa sex ratios fluctuate widely adam et al 2011 peaks in bunch number and yield and to a lesser extent sex ratio typically conincided with the onset of the long rain season march july fig 2 in year 3 the average number of bunches ha 1 month 1 was 120 for the i0f0 treatment 124 for i0f1 and 128 and 132 for i1f0 and i1f1 respectively most bunches were harvested in february with 228 bunches 16 of the annual bunch production for the i0f0 treatment 273 18 bunches for i0f1 226 15 for i1f0 and 239 15 for i1f1 fig 5 the peak months were february may where 55 of the annual number of bunches were harvested for the i0f0 treatment an average of 199 bunches ha 1 month 1 opposed to an average of 81 bunches ha 1 month 1 during the other months 53 for i0f1 196 bunches ha 1 month 1 vs 88 bunches ha 1 month 1 49 186 bunches ha 1 month 1 vs 98 bunches ha 1 month 1 for i1f0 and 45 for i1f1 179 bunches ha 1 month 1 vs 108 bunches ha 1 month 1 indicating a slightly lower peak for irrigated treatments the coefficient of variance cov for monthly fruit bunch production was 56 for the i0f0 treatment 55 for i0f1 51 for i1f0 and 48 for the i1f1 treatment suggesting a slightly more regular annual bunch number production with irrigation for comparison prioux et al 1992 obtained a cov of 30 with irrigation opposed to 60 without irrigation suggesting irrigation was essential in regulating monthly production distribution 3 2 water balance i1f0 and i1f1 treatments received 656 mm of water with irrigation in year 1 711 mm irrigation in year 2 and 496 mm irrigation in year 3 as a result the annual water deficit in year 1 was 735 mm and 96 mm for non irrigated and irrigated plots respectively 709 mm and 80 mm in year 2 and 735 and 331 mm in year 3 table 1 the deficits were largest in the months august september and december march which coincided with dry spells irrigation events were succesfully planned using tensiometers but water deficits could not be fully erradicated due to pump failures and periods when the irrigation water was too saline to be used simple linear regression indicated that 31 months before harvest 20 months before harvest and 8 months before harvest were the three most sensitive periods to water stress in the i0f0 treatment whilst 30 months 19 months and 7 months before harvest accounted for most of the observed variation in yield for all other treatments fig 6 table 2 additionally multiple linear regressions suggested that the period corresponding to bunch abortion 7 13 months before harvest gave the least significant prediction of yield for all treatments table 2 the main sensitive phase for drought effects was estimated to be 30 months before bunch harvest i e the period of inflorescence sex determination for all treatments except the control this is in line with results reported by legros et al 2009 but in contrast to results reported by dufour et al 1988 and caliman and southworth 1998 where the period associated with bunch abortion had the greatest impact on yield repeating both analyses including the effect of irrigation on the water balance showed a weaker coefficient of determination r2 suggesting that irrigation did not influence yield cycles in irrigated plots and that environmental factors other than rainfall may also contribute to yield oscillations corley and tinker 2016 3 3 leaf nutrient concentrations there were no significant differences p 0 05 between average leaf nutrient concentrations for nitrogen n phosphorus p potassium k magnesium mg and boron b for all treatments and years except in year 2 where leaf n concentration in i1f1 and i1f0 treatments was significantly larger p 0 05 than the i0f0 treatment and where leaf k concentration in i1f1 was significantly larger p 0 05 than the i1f0 treatment fig 7 all leaf nutrient concentrations increased from year 1 3 except for n where a decline was observed significant p 0 05 for the i1f0 treatment the increase was significant p 0 05 for k for all treatments but i0f0 for mg for the i0f0 treatment and in all treatments for b in year 3 n was within the optimal range for the i1f1 treatment whilst all other treatments were deficient p was only sufficient for the i0f0 treatment in year 3 whilst k was deficient in all treatments all treatments were sufficient in mg and b in year 3 no significant differences p 0 05 between average rachis nutrient concentrations for n p k and mg were observed for all treatments and years but for rachis n concentration in year 3 between the i0f0 and i1f1 treatment and for rachis p concentration in year 1 between the i1f0 and i1f1 treatment rachis n concentrations declined for all treatments from year 1 3 whilst rachis p k and mg concentrations increased for all treatments significant p 0 05 for p and k and for the i0f0 treatment in mg rachis n concentration was deficient for all treatments whilst rachis p k and mg were all sufficient in year 3 3 4 physiological measurements the maturation time and accumulation of unopened leaves spears in the crown are direct physiological responses to water stress whilst no clear relationships were found between time of maturation and the actual water balance no time lag included data suggests a shorter bunch maturation time and an increase in the accumulation of unopened leaves in the crown following periods of water stress particularly after the long dry season from december february for the i0f1 treatment fig 8 a shorter maturation time is likely caused by an increase in ethylene production initiated by water stress abeles et al 1992 which could accelerate fruit ripening it is known that variations in maturation time and frond production rate exacerbate production irregularities nouy et al 1999 during the dry season leaflets often accumulate as unopened spears in the palm crown whilst the bunch maturation time is shorter frond production rate therefore shows a clear seasonality in west africa with a minimum during the dry season and a maximum immediately after the dry season corley 1977 thus after the rains have started a flush of leaf opening is commonly observed carr 2011 however no significant differences p 0 10 were found for the average maturation time between treatments for year 2 3 5 yield gaps oil palm is in the plateau yield phase at 16 years after planting yap with the nutrient limited yield yn estimated at 28 5 t ha 1 fb the water limited yield yw at 27 9 t ha 1 fb and the potential yield yp at 32 6 t ha 1 fb the average yw was similar to the average yw in the plateau yield phase 26 6 t ha 1 fb reported by rhebergen et al 2018 which was determined from yield data across 23 trial sites in the oil palm belt of ghana short term yield gaps caused by nutrients yg2 were estimated to be 4 1 t ha 1 fb while yield gaps caused by water and water nutrients yg1 yg3 were both estimated to be 4 7 t ha 1 fb 4 discussion 4 1 water and nutrient limited yield gaps we investigated the short term fruit bunch yield performance of mature oil palm under several fertilizer and irrigation treatments because of the long time lag between sex differentiation of the inﬂorescences and harvesting of ripe fruit it is only possible to begin to assess the effectiveness of irrigation and fertilizer after 28 months provided it is sustained over the whole time period carr 2011 the full treatment response is therefore only expected in the third year after trial implementation compared with the control treatment i0f0 27 9 t ha 1 fb the i1f1 treatment increased fruit bunch yields by 4 7 t ha 1 while the effect of irrigation alone i1f0 was 0 6 t ha 1 indicating that fertilizer was critical for a maximum response to irrigation this is similar to findings reported by tittinutchanon et al 2008 where fertilizer was essential for maximizing yields with irrigation the benefit of adding fertilizer with irrigation was therefore estimated at 4 1 t ha 1 fb which is approximately 0 9 t ha 1 crude palm oil cpo at 21 oil extraction rate oer leaf nutrient concentrations are known to vary due to a wide range of factors such as rainfall soil type and fertilization fairhurst and mutert 1999 clear trends were found in leaf and rachis nutrient concentrations in all treatments including a decrease in n concentration and an increase in all other nutrient concentrations from start to end of the experiment whilst treatments did not have a clear significant effect on nutrient concentrations by year 3 leaf nutrient concentrations for n k and b were largest in the i1f1 treatment and largest in the i0f0 treatment for p by comparison cheng xu et al 2011 found that water and nutrient stress decreased leaf n and p concentrations in oil palm seedlings but increased k concentration compared with irrigated treatments lee et al 2011 on the other hand found lower leaf nutrient concentrations for n p k and mg in irrigated palms 5 yap but higher rachis nutrient concentrations particularly for k and b and a larger storage of rachis p k s and b contents due to a larger increase in dry matter lee et al 2014 lee et al 2011 suggests that higher yields with irrigation demand larger amounts of plant nutrients to support optimal growth and yield which is reflected by lower leaf nutrient concentrations furthermore leaching losses of soluble nutrients k and mg are expected to be higher with irrigation lee et al 2011 despite efforts to ensure nutrients were non limiting with fertilization leaf nutrient concentrations for p and k were deficient in all treatments whilst rachis p k and mg concentrations were excessive indicating a nutritional imbalance in the palm particularly for p and k rachis concentrations were largest with the i1f1 treatment supporting the hypothesis that palms grown under more favourable conditions have higher rachis nutrient concentrations and are able to store larger amounts of nutrients lee et al 2014 given the nutritional imbalance between the leaf and rachis it is therefore essential to consider the nutrients stored in the reserve tissues i e rachis as well as the leaf while preparing fertilizer recommendations foster and prabowo 2006 for example to increase a deficient concentration of leaf p if rachis p is satisfactory an increase in either fertilizer n or fertilizer k is generally effective depending on whether n or k is most deficient to increase a deficient concentration of leaf k if rachis k is satisfactory an increase in fertilizer n is generally effective foster and prabowo 2006 given these complex interactions further research is required to determine optimal application rates of specific nutrients following a 4r nutrient stewardship ipni 2012 approach with and without irrigation because the yield in the control treatment i0f0 improved from year 1 to year 3 table 1 it is likely that the actual yield response with irrigation and fertilizer was underestimated yield improvements were most likely due to better management in trial plots but it is also possible that water and nutrient poaching from neighbouring plots occurred since oil palm roots can spread laterally up to 25 m from the trunk carr 2011 the i0f0 average yield for year 1 therefore provides a better baseline for the water and nutrient limited yield giving a yg3 of 8 0 t ha 1 fb for comparison tittinutchanon et al 2008 reported fruit bunch yield increases of up to 10 t ha 1 to 28 t ha 1 with irrigation and high rates of fertilizer in thailand in a climate similar to that of ghana the increase in yield can be attributed to an increase in bunch number with little to no effect of bunch weight increases in bunch number were therefore most likely caused by improvements in the sex ratio and a reduction in the abortion of immature inflorescences 4 2 understanding mechanisms that determine yield fluctuations results from the multiple linear regression indicated that the period associated with inflorescence sex determination was most sensitive to drought and likely to contribute most to yield oscillations in ghana fig 6 however because of the unique vegetative structure of oil palm stem and leaves together with the long time lag between floral initiation and fruit bunch harvest causal links between environmental factors and yield are difficult to establish carr 2011 whilst the effects of water stress on oil palm are well known the extent to which the monthly yield cycles are affected is poorly understood corley and hong 1982 the environmental factor most likely to explain yield oscillations in regions with severe and regular annual dry seasons is the soil water supply henson and dolmat 2004 however because of the trial block s proximity to a river it is likely that palms in all treatments had access to water in the dry season due to a high water table which can modify the actual water deficit caliman and southworth 1998 while piezometer readings indicate the existence of a water table 2 m which was the limit of measurement at the onset of the long rains it is uncertain to which depth the palms extracted water exactly since no root profiles were done observations from cote d ivoire for example have shown that palms can access water from the soil at a depth of at least 5 m caliman 1992 and that large yields can be obtained under drier conditions when the lack of rainfall is compensated for by a high water table quencez et al 1987 given that all palms may have had access to groundwater this suggests that yield cycles were not solely regulated by the soil water supply in support of this whilst irrigation ameliorated the water deficit and increased fruit bunch yields the use of irrigation did not affect yield cycles fig 6 this is consistent with findings reported by chan et al 1985 foong and lee 2000 and kee and chew 1991 suggesting that yield cycles are controlled by factors other than rainfall corley and tinker 2016 alternatively henson and dolmat 2004 suggested that factors associated with dry conditions other than the soil water supply such as high temperature high atmospheric vapour pressure deficit and high evaporation rate may be involved in yield cycling all of which correlate well with rainfall in particular the stomata are considerably sensitive to vapour pressure deficit an increase in which causes the stomata to close even when there is a good water supply carr 2011 stomatal closure is therefore an important factor limiting photosynthesis and hence dry matter production in oil palm dufrene et al 1990 smith 1989 for example showed that high atmospheric vapour pressure deficits may limit production even in parts of the world where oil palm do not normally suffer from water stress while it can be expected that the use of sprinkler irrigation might overcome stomatal closure in dry air by wetting the soil surface and humidifying the atmosphere no evidence has been provided yet tittinutchanon et al 2008 it is therefore likely that atmospheric conditions were similar in the trial but measurements of stomatal conductance or vapour pressure deficit are required to confirm this annual cycles of meteorological variables other than rainfall may also contribute to yield cycle patterns henson and dolmat 2004 demonstrated that it was possible to match oscillations in solar radiation and evaporation rate with annual yield using appropriate time lags although the relationship may not be causal additionally legros et al 2009 assumed that seasonal peaks of ﬂowering in oil palm are controlled by photoperiod response within a phytomer even at oil palm sites close to the equator they further suggest these patterns are confounded with drought effects that affect fruit bunch yield with long time lags but results remain to be confirmed using a modelling approach combres et al 2013 also suggested the involvement of photoperiod in bunch production dynamics whilst dufrene et al 1990 observed that sunlight and vapour pressure deficit combined may explain variations in maximal yield between west africa and southeast asia it is therefore possible that present monthly yield may be affected by multiple past stress events at different time lags before harvest which complicates attempts to understand the effects of climate in the absence of external constraints it has been proposed that yield cycles are regulated by endogenous mechanisms whereby current yield levels may impact future bunch number through sex differentiation and abortion corley 1977 however it has been argued that the time lags involved in these processes would not readily lead to annual yield cycles unless abortion levels were high and sex differentiation occurred at a relatively late stage henson and dolmat 2004 4 3 managing oil palms under water stress in west africa where rainfall patterns are characterized by a long and short rainy season and a long and short dry season irregular patterns in production are typical for all treatments 15 of the annual bunch production in year 3 was harvested in february with as little as 4 in low crop months fig 5 understanding local yield cycles of oil palm is of economic importance because the volume of fruit in the peak month determines the size of the mill and hence the scale of investment needed by a plantation corley and tinker 2016 furthermore irregular distribution of production has several consequences for plantation management including lack of milling capacity during peak crop months and underutilization in the production trough lack of sufficient harvesters in the peak months resulting in extended harvest intervals and crop loss and fluctuations in fruit bunch oil content with in particular a sharp drop at the end of the dry season nouy et al 1999 forecasting future yields on a monthly basis therefore helps plantation managers to better plan labour and milling requirements and is also useful to marketers as forward selling of palm oil is common corley and tinker 2016 because climate is becoming increasingly unpredictable the need for simple predictive models to forecast future yields will therefore become more essential in plantation management a practical way of reducing annual fluctuations in production is to plant a mixture of planting materials with different yield patterns corley and tinker 2016 as demonstrated in north sumatra nouy et al 1996 and benin cros et al 2013 implying that genetic diversity partly regulates the annual bunch production profile in oil palm or by partially disbudding palms to shift yield peaks out of phase and reducing yield fluctuations of the area as a whole corley 1977 management implications to mitigate the effect of water stress on oil palm include the use of irrigation to correct water deficits planting in sites with a high water table adequate drainage to remove excess water since prolonged flooding is known to reduce stomatal conductance and gas exchange processes photosynthesis and transpiration and to kill young palms lamade et al 1998 preventing water runoff on sloping terrain e g contour planting terraces appropriate frondstacking techniques improving structure in compact soils to allow for better root development mulching with organic materials e g empty fruit bunches to reduce soil surface evaporation and removal of inflorescences on young oil palms to stimulate root development and improve drought tolerance caliman 1992 carr 2011 furthermore potassium k is an essential macronutrient needed in large amounts by oil palm and is directly involved in several physiological processes including transport of assimilates and stomatal regulation taulya 2013 k is therefore essential in avoiding water loss during water stress situations maintaining adequate plant k with balanced fertilization is thus important for plant drought resistance wang et al 2013 5 conclusions results of the trial show the potential of irrigation and fertilizer to close yield gaps in mature oil palm stands in ghana average fb yields of 32 6 t ha 1 were obtained with a combination of irrigation and fertilizer while fb yields with irrigation only averaged 28 5 t ha 1 fb the benefit of adding fertilizer with irrigation was therefore estimated at 4 1 t ha 1 fb which is approximately equivalent to 0 9 t ha 1 crude palm oil cpo at 21 oil extraction rate oer fertilizer was therefore essential for a maximum response to irrigation but information on which nutrients are most important and optimal application rates are lacking to ensure balanced nutrition in oil palm with irrigation while yield increases were mostly caused by increases in bunch number annual yield cycles persisted despite the use of irrigation irregular distribution of production leads to lack of mill capacity and insufficient harvesters in the peak crop months many factors have been proposed that cause these fluctuations both external and endogenous indicating a complicated interaction of several components yield cycles and yield determining process es therefore remain unclear and require

11008,oil palm eleais guineensisjacq production in west africa is limited by poor soils and suboptimal climate the potential to improve fruit bunch fb yields with appropriate water and nutrient management in ghana is thus considerable to assess the effects of water and nutrient management on oil palm yields a 2 x 2 factorial randomized complete block design with irrigation and fertilizer was implemented for three years in the main oil palm production area of western region ghana treatments included i zero irrigation zero fertilizer control ii zero irrigation fertilizer iii irrigation zero fertilizer and iv irrigation fertilizer all replicated four times fertilized treatments received annual nutrient application rates of 2 0 kg palm 1 nitrogen n 0 4 kg palm 1 phosphorus p 2 5 kg palm 1 potassium k 0 3 kg palm 1 magnesium mg and 0 15 kg palm 1 boron b irrigation using sprinklers was scheduled using tensiometers and was given to meet the daily evaporation of oil palm 450 l palm 1 day 1 or 6 5 mm day 1 average attainable yields of 32 6 t ha 1 fb were achieved with irrigation and fertilizer which was 4 7 t ha 1 greater than the control 27 9 t ha 1 and 4 1 t ha 1 greater than with irrigation alone 28 5 t ha 1 fertilizer was therefore essential for a maximum response to irrigation whilst yield increases were mostly attributed to increases in bunch number large variations in monthly yield persisted at all treatments despite the use of irrigation with production peaks typically coninciding with the onset of the long rain season march july whilst a number of factors may contribute e g vapour pressure deficit the process es regulating yield cycles remain unclear and require further research keywords irrigation fertilizer water deficit yield cycle yield gap 1 introduction although oil palm eleais guineensis jacq is indigenous to west africa the soils and climatic conditions in the region are considered suboptimal for its cultivation rhebergen et al 2016 in southern ghana soils are predominately coarse textured strongly weathered and highly leached acrisols and ferralsols usda ultisols and oxisols respectively with low ph and poor soil fertility status buringh 1979 the major climatic constraint is the prolonged dry season of 4 5 months with mean annual water deficits up to 600 mm yr 1 rhebergen et al 2016 van der vossen 1969 a recent land suitability assessment showed that large areas within the oil palm belt of ghana are susceptible to annual water deficits approaching 400 mm rhebergen et al 2016 there is a time lag of 35 40 months between the occurrence of abiotic and biotic stress events and yield response in oil palm which makes it difficult to unravel the effects of environmental factors on fruit bunch fb yield breure 2003 corley and tinker 2016 several authors have attempted to explain yield responses in relation to the annual water deficit in west africa for example hartley 1988 reported a 10 yield reduction with every 100 mm of annual water deficit caliman and southworth 1998 observed that moisture stress negatively affected floral initiation 1 3 sex differentiation 3 4 and abortion rate 8 10 per 100 mm of deficit with a concomitant yield reduction of 8 10 per 100 mm deficit in the first year and 3 4 in the second a yield reduction of 40 50 was recorded when severe water stress occurred in the previous year in côte d ivoire olivin 1968 reported a yield reduction of 10 20 with 100 mm annual water deficit depending on the soils water storage capacity while ochs and daniel 1976 reported similar yield penalties based on observations made in the ivory coast benin and cameroon in ghana yields ranged from 22 25 t ha 1 fb for areas with annual water deficits of 150 mm 16 18 t ha 1 fb for areas with annual water deficits of 250 mm and 6 7 t ha 1 fb for areas with an annual water deficit of 400 mm suggesting an almost linear relationship between yield and water deficit danso et al 2008 therefore there are strong prospects for reducing the negative impact of moisture stress on yields in ghana supplementary water supply through irrigation provides an opportunity to increase oil palm yields in regions with sub optimal rainfall corley and hong 1982 prioux et al 1992 obtained maximum yields of 22 t ha 1 fb with irrigation in ivory coast a 21 increase in production over non irrigated palms while yields increased four fold with irrigation in a trial described by desmarest 1967 in addition to moisture stress oil palm yields in ghana are limited by poor soil fertility and inadequate nutrient supply rhebergen et al 2018 analysis of soil and plant samples from trial sites in ghana showed severe and widespread deficiencies of soil phosphorus p and potassium k on large plantations and smallholder farms rhebergen et al 2018 in addition several trials in west africa confirmed that k is deficient on sedimentary soils p on basement complex derived soils and that mg may be needed on acid sandy soils corley and tinker 2016 the potential to improve oil palm production with appropriate water and nutrient management in ghana is thus substantial and could greatly increase profitability for oil palm producers as well as sparing land for nature in this paper we evaluated the interaction of irrigation and nutrient application on the yield of oil palm on a large scale oil palm plantation over three years in western region ghana the objectives were i to quantify yield gaps caused by water and nutrient constraints and ii to analyse the interaction of water and nutrients on yield trends and yield components 2 methods 2 1 study area a trial was established to assess the effects of irrigation and fertilizer on oil palm yields at the norpalm ghana ltd plantation ngl 4 55 29 04 n 1 53 31 75 w 11 masl which is located in the ahanta west district of the western region ghana ngl s nucleus estate consists of approximately 4 500 ha distributed between the sese 500 ha and pretsea 4 000 ha sites fig 1 slopes at ngl are gentle to hilly 4 40 and soils are classified as gleysols in poorly drained valley bottoms and flood plains and lixisols on sloping terrain fig 1 rainfall at ngl is bimodal with long rains from march july and short rains from september november average rainfall from 2011 to 2016 was lower at the sese site 1 136 mm than at pretsea 1 511 mm with considerable variability between months and years as a result the average annual water deficit calculated using the method of surre 1968 over the same period was higher at sese 608 mm than in pretsea 355 mm fig 2 2 2 trial setup and management the trial was established at the sese plantation on february 2015 in a 34 ha block that had been planted in 2002 fig 1 the trial block was planted at 143 palms ha 1 using triangular spacing and consisted entirely of tenera i e dura x pisifera dxp palms of pobé benin material which had been planted 13 years before at the time of trial establishment the topography was flat an isometric map of the trial block was produced including the number of mature immature new supply abnormal and dead removed palms or unplantable points and was used to delineate the trial plots each plot consisted of clusters of 36 palms 6 6 of which the inner 16 palms 4 4 were used for taking measurements recording palms and the outer palms provided a guard row fig 3 the recording palms consisted entirely of productive and healthy palms while the guard row included some abnormal and immature palms each recording plot 4 4 was approximately 0 11 ha all plots were bounded by a trench of at least 50 cm deep to avoid nutrient and water movement between trial plots and access from bordering palms at least two palm rows were also kept as a buffer between plots the entire trial block was managed with best management practices bmp donough et al 2009 to ensure that yields were not constrained by other factors besides nutrients and water 2 3 experimental design the trial was established at the sese plantation division because of its proximity to a river for irrigation the trial was designed to quantify the bunch yield potential yp without moisture stress and to investigate the interaction of nutrient and water supply on oil palm yield components a 2 2 factorial randomized complete block design was used which included four treatments i zero irrigation zero fertilizer i0f0 i e control ii zero irrigation fertilizer i0f1 iii irrigation zero fertilizer i1f0 and iv irrigation fertilizer i1f1 each treatment was replicated four times with blocks following moisture gradients in total 16 plots were installed fig 3 fertilizer treatments covered the main limiting nutrients nitrogen n phosphorus p potassium k and magnesium mg applied as urea triple superphosphate tsp muriate of potash mop and kieserite respectively annual application rates ofnutrients elemental form were 2 0 kg palm 1 n 0 4 kg palm 1 p 2 5 kg palm 1 k and 0 3 kg palm 1 mg in addition all fertilizer treatment plots received an annual application of 0 15 kg palm 1 boron b to overcome b deficiency fertilizer application rates were based on previous fertilizer experiments and were drafted to ensure nutrients were not limiting fertilizers were applied to all palms in each fertilizer treatment plot including the guard row p k and mg fertilizers were broadcast over the edge of the weeded circle into the frond stack whilst b was applied as sodium borate in a band 1 m wide and 1 m from the palm trunk and urea in the weeded circle to reduce volatilization losses all fertilizers were applied during the rainy seasons sodium borate was applied in march urea in april and august mop in may and september tsp in june and kieserite in july fertilizer application rates and timing followed the same schedule each year and no mill residues e g empty fruit bunches efb were applied to the palms during the experiment irrigation needs were based on the soil water potential kpa which was measured using tensiometers in total four tensiometers were installed one in each block at 20 cm depth where most of the fine roots are located taillez 1971 all tensiometers were installed at the edge of the weeded circle at approximately 2 m from the palm trunk to maintain the soil as close as possible to field capacity at all times the critical soil water potential for irrigation was set at 20 kpa alam and rogers 1997 irrigated plots consisted of 12 sprinklers senninger smoothdrive each with a radius of 9 3 10 2 m each sprinkler thus covered three palms see insert fig 3 at an operating pressure of 207 kpa approximately 150 min of irrigation was given to meet the daily evaporation of oil palm 450 l palm 1 day 1 or 6 5 mm day 1 carr 2011 corley and tinker 2016 which was recorded during each irrigation event to ensure that the right quantity of water was supplied a flow meter was installed in line with the irrigation discharge pipe in order to evaluate the effect of irrigation in eliminating soil moisture stress we calculated the water balance for irrigated and non irrigated plots following the method of surre 1968 b s r e s p e t p where b monthly water balance mm sres residual soil water from the previous month mm p monthly rainfall mm and etp monthly potential evapotranspiration mm the monthly evapotranspiration etp of an oil palm field was estimated at 150 mm when there were 11 days on which measurable rainfall was recorded and at 120 mm for months with 11 rainfall days surre 1968 soil texture in the trial block was predominantly clay loam which has a maximum plant available water storage of about 150 mm per metre of soil depth saxton and rawls 2006 a soil depth of 1 m was taken since this is the zone exploited by the majority of oil palm roots nelson et al 2006 when b was 0 then that value was the water deficit and the initial soil moisture sres for the next month was zero where b was 150 mm but positive then that value was taken as the initial sres of the following month where b was 150 mm the sres of the following month was 150 mm we assumed that all excess water was lost as runoff or drainage to depth the annual water deﬁcit was calculated as the sum of all negative monthly water balances for the year for irrigated plots the water balance was calculated by adding the amount of irrigation mm to the monthly precipitation and the number of irrigation days to the number of rain days scorching of palm leaves was briefly experienced in the dry season in the first year due to tidal saline water incursions and a corrective measure was taken to use ec meters to monitor the salinity of the irrigation water at each irrigation event no irrigation was given when ec exceeded 3000 μs cm 1 to prevent scorching of the palm leaves and ground cover fipps 2003 piezometers were installed in eight plots two per replicate and monitored weekly to assess the groundwater level tensiometers were removed from the field during periods of flooding which occurred with heavy rainfall in march june and october 2016 and may and june 2017 2 4 data collection 2 4 1 crop production bunch number fruit bunch weight kg including loose fruits and number of male flowers were recorded at harvest intervals of 7 days at each plot crop production data were reported as the total for each plot inner 16 palms fruit bunch weight was measured with a tripod and digital scale and bunch production data was used to derive yield totals t ha 1 fb bunch number and the number of male flowers were used to determine the sex ratio i e the ratio of female to total inflorescences 2 4 2 leaf sampling palm nutritional status and fertilizer recommendations for mature oil palm are commonly made based on leaf and rachis nutrient concentrations from frond 17 due to their high correlation with yield fairhurst 1996 foster and prabowo 2006 leaf and rachis samples for nutrient determination were therefore taken annually at each recording palm inner 16 palms at a distance of approximately two thirds between the insertion point of the first true leaves on the leaf petiole and the distal end of frond 17 chapman and gray 1949 fairhurst et al 2004 composite leaf and rachis samples were produced for each plot and analysed at yara laboratory uk for n using a combustion analyser dumas technique and p k mg and b only leaf by inductively coupled plasma analyser icp with averages derived per treatment 2 4 3 physiological measurements physiological measurements were taken to investigate the effects of drought and water

included maturation time and number of unopened fronds and were carried out at weekly intervals on each individual recording palm inner 16 palms with averages derived per plot maturation time was measured as the time interval days between anthesis and harvesting ripeness all bunches were labelled with wire tags embedded in the flower to record the date and frond position at anthesis and at harvest newly emerging bunches were monitored routinely on each palm during each recording event crop production data including bunch number and the number of male flowers were used to determine the sex ratio and monthly yield distribution for each treatment 2 4 4 calculation of yield gaps we adjusted the yield gap model of rhebergen et al 2018 to include the nutrient limited yield yn because the trial was managed with bmp and only complete productive palm stands were used production level ymey the yield reduced by deficiencies in plantation establishment and yam the yield reduced by inadequate agronomic management were not included in the model the average yield achieved with i1f1 in year 3 served as a proxy for the potential yield yp the average yield with i0f1 in year 3 provided an estimate of oil palm production assuming optimal nutrient management and served as a proxy for the water limited yield yw while the i1f0 treatment served as a proxy for the yield limited by nutrients only yn and i0f0 for the water and nutrient limited yw n the difference between average yields achieved with yp and yw therefore gives us an estimate of the yield gap caused by water yield gap 1 yg1 and was calculated as y g 1 y p y w while nutrient limited yield gaps yield gap 2 yg2 were calculated as y g 2 y p y n the gap caused by both water and nutrient limitations yield gap 3 yg3 was calculated as the difference between yp and yw n y g 3 y p y w n 2 5 data analysis all data was summarized on an annual basis unless indicated differences between treatment means were analysed with a unianova for each year including yield components yield bunch weight and bunch number and leaf and rachis nutrient concentrations as dependent variables and replication and treatment as factors in oil palm there are three periods where production is sensitive to water stress caliman and southworth 1998 dufour et al 1988 i 30 33 months before harvesting which corresponds to the sex differentiation period ii 19 24 months before harvesting which corresponds to the fast growth of the leaf supporting the inflorescence and iii 7 13 months before harvesting which corresponds to the period of abortion for each water stress sensitive period we used simple linear regression with fruit bunch yield as the dependent variable and the water balance as the independent variable to determine which months were most significant in predicting yield for each treatment we then entered the most significant months in a multiple linear regression model for each treatment and removed the variables that did not make a significant p 0 05 contribution to the regression all statistics were performed using ibm spss statistics version 24 3 results 3 1 yield components the pre trial annual yield was 17 7 ha 1 fb across the whole block in year 1 average fb yields were 6 9 t ha 1 greater at 24 6 t ha 1 in the control treatment i0f0 compared with 7 0 t ha 1 greater in the i0f1 treatment 24 7 t ha 1 6 3 t ha 1 in the i1f0 24 0 t ha 1 and 6 6 t ha 1 larger in the i1f1 treatment 24 3 t ha 1 table 1 we attribute the larger yields in year 1 to the fact that trial plots consisted entirely of productive palms as well as improved crop management including more frequent and complete harvesting events average fb yields increased in year 2 and 3 with the i1f1 treatment yielding significantly more than other treatments at 32 6 t ha 1 the large fb yield increase with i1f1 suggests that there was a significant irrigation x fertilizer interaction average bunch weight abw kg decreased with each year for all treatments whilst bunch number per palm bn increased the increase was largest for the i1f1 treatment where bunch number increased from 7 5 11 1 bunches palm 1 48 bunch number per palm depends on the frond production rate the sex ratio the abortion rate and the bunch failure rate carr 2011 the increase in bunch number coincided with a decrease in the number of male flowers and an increase in the sex ratio for all treatments table 1 whilst increases in bunch number with irrigation are mostly due to changes in both abortion rate and sex ratio corley and hong 1982 monthly yield components fluctuated widely for all treatments with most notably the clear seasonality in bunch number fig 4 in mature palms variation in bunch number contibutes much more to yield cycles than does bunch weight with sex variation commonly regarded as the prime cause of yield variation corley and tinker 2016 henson and dolmat 2004 in regions with high and regular rainfall e g parts of north sumatra indonesia and sabah malaysia sex ratios tend to vary little throughout the year whilst in areas with a marked dry season west africa sex ratios fluctuate widely adam et al 2011 peaks in bunch number and yield and to a lesser extent sex ratio typically conincided with the onset of the long rain season march july fig 2 in year 3 the average number of bunches ha 1 month 1 was 120 for the i0f0 treatment 124 for i0f1 and 128 and 132 for i1f0 and i1f1 respectively most bunches were harvested in february with 228 bunches 16 of the annual bunch production for the i0f0 treatment 273 18 bunches for i0f1 226 15 for i1f0 and 239 15 for i1f1 fig 5 the peak months were february may where 55 of the annual number of bunches were harvested for the i0f0 treatment an average of 199 bunches ha 1 month 1 opposed to an average of 81 bunches ha 1 month 1 during the other months 53 for i0f1 196 bunches ha 1 month 1 vs 88 bunches ha 1 month 1 49 186 bunches ha 1 month 1 vs 98 bunches ha 1 month 1 for i1f0 and 45 for i1f1 179 bunches ha 1 month 1 vs 108 bunches ha 1 month 1 indicating a slightly lower peak for irrigated treatments the coefficient of variance cov for monthly fruit bunch production was 56 for the i0f0 treatment 55 for i0f1 51 for i1f0 and 48 for the i1f1 treatment suggesting a slightly more regular annual bunch number production with irrigation for comparison prioux et al 1992 obtained a cov of 30 with irrigation opposed to 60 without irrigation suggesting irrigation was essential in regulating monthly production distribution 3 2 water balance i1f0 and i1f1 treatments received 656 mm of water with irrigation in year 1 711 mm irrigation in year 2 and 496 mm irrigation in year 3 as a result the annual water deficit in year 1 was 735 mm and 96 mm for non irrigated and irrigated plots respectively 709 mm and 80 mm in year 2 and 735 and 331 mm in year 3 table 1 the deficits were largest in the months august september and december march which coincided with dry spells irrigation events were succesfully planned using tensiometers but water deficits could not be fully erradicated due to pump failures and periods when the irrigation water was too saline to be used simple linear regression indicated that 31 months before harvest 20 months before harvest and 8 months before harvest were the three most sensitive periods to water stress in the i0f0 treatment whilst 30 months 19 months and 7 months before harvest accounted for most of the observed variation in yield for all other treatments fig 6 table 2 additionally multiple linear regressions suggested that the period corresponding to bunch abortion 7 13 months before harvest gave the least significant prediction of yield for all treatments table 2 the main sensitive phase for drought effects was estimated to be 30 months before bunch harvest i e the period of inflorescence sex determination for all treatments except the control this is in line with results reported by legros et al 2009 but in contrast to results reported by dufour et al 1988 and caliman and southworth 1998 where the period associated with bunch abortion had the greatest impact on yield repeating both analyses including the effect of irrigation on the water balance showed a weaker coefficient of determination r2 suggesting that irrigation did not influence yield cycles in irrigated plots and that environmental factors other than rainfall may also contribute to yield oscillations corley and tinker 2016 3 3 leaf nutrient concentrations there were no significant differences p 0 05 between average leaf nutrient concentrations for nitrogen n phosphorus p potassium k magnesium mg and boron b for all treatments and years except in year 2 where leaf n concentration in i1f1 and i1f0 treatments was significantly larger p 0 05 than the i0f0 treatment and where leaf k concentration in i1f1 was significantly larger p 0 05 than the i1f0 treatment fig 7 all leaf nutrient concentrations increased from year 1 3 except for n where a decline was observed significant p 0 05 for the i1f0 treatment the increase was significant p 0 05 for k for all treatments but i0f0 for mg for the i0f0 treatment and in all treatments for b in year 3 n was within the optimal range for the i1f1 treatment whilst all other treatments were deficient p was only sufficient for the i0f0 treatment in year 3 whilst k was deficient in all treatments all treatments were sufficient in mg and b in year 3 no significant differences p 0 05 between average rachis nutrient concentrations for n p k and mg were observed for all treatments and years but for rachis n concentration in year 3 between the i0f0 and i1f1 treatment and for rachis p concentration in year 1 between the i1f0 and i1f1 treatment rachis n concentrations declined for all treatments from year 1 3 whilst rachis p k and mg concentrations increased for all treatments significant p 0 05 for p and k and for the i0f0 treatment in mg rachis n concentration was deficient for all treatments whilst rachis p k and mg were all sufficient in year 3 3 4 physiological measurements the maturation time and accumulation of unopened leaves spears in the crown are direct physiological responses to water stress whilst no clear relationships were found between time of maturation and the actual water balance no time lag included data suggests a shorter bunch maturation time and an increase in the accumulation of unopened leaves in the crown following periods of water stress particularly after the long dry season from december february for the i0f1 treatment fig 8 a shorter maturation time is likely caused by an increase in ethylene production initiated by water stress abeles et al 1992 which could accelerate fruit ripening it is known that variations in maturation time and frond production rate exacerbate production irregularities nouy et al 1999 during the dry season leaflets often accumulate as unopened spears in the palm crown whilst the bunch maturation time is shorter frond production rate therefore shows a clear seasonality in west africa with a minimum during the dry season and a maximum immediately after the dry season corley 1977 thus after the rains have started a flush of leaf opening is commonly observed carr 2011 however no significant differences p 0 10 were found for the average maturation time between treatments for year 2 3 5 yield gaps oil palm is in the plateau yield phase at 16 years after planting yap with the nutrient limited yield yn estimated at 28 5 t ha 1 fb the water limited yield yw at 27 9 t ha 1 fb and the potential yield yp at 32 6 t ha 1 fb the average yw was similar to the average yw in the plateau yield phase 26 6 t ha 1 fb reported by rhebergen et al 2018 which was determined from yield data across 23 trial sites in the oil palm belt of ghana short term yield gaps caused by nutrients yg2 were estimated to be 4 1 t ha 1 fb while yield gaps caused by water and water nutrients yg1 yg3 were both estimated to be 4 7 t ha 1 fb 4 discussion 4 1 water and nutrient limited yield gaps we investigated the short term fruit bunch yield performance of mature oil palm under several fertilizer and irrigation treatments because of the long time lag between sex differentiation of the inﬂorescences and harvesting of ripe fruit it is only possible to begin to assess the effectiveness of irrigation and fertilizer after 28 months provided it is sustained over the whole time period carr 2011 the full treatment response is therefore only expected in the third year after trial implementation compared with the control treatment i0f0 27 9 t ha 1 fb the i1f1 treatment increased fruit bunch yields by 4 7 t ha 1 while the effect of irrigation alone i1f0 was 0 6 t ha 1 indicating that fertilizer was critical for a maximum response to irrigation this is similar to findings reported by tittinutchanon et al 2008 where fertilizer was essential for maximizing yields with irrigation the benefit of adding fertilizer with irrigation was therefore estimated at 4 1 t ha 1 fb which is approximately 0 9 t ha 1 crude palm oil cpo at 21 oil extraction rate oer leaf nutrient concentrations are known to vary due to a wide range of factors such as rainfall soil type and fertilization fairhurst and mutert 1999 clear trends were found in leaf and rachis nutrient concentrations in all treatments including a decrease in n concentration and an increase in all other nutrient concentrations from start to end of the experiment whilst treatments did not have a clear significant effect on nutrient concentrations by year 3 leaf nutrient concentrations for n k and b were largest in the i1f1 treatment and largest in the i0f0 treatment for p by comparison cheng xu et al 2011 found that water and nutrient stress decreased leaf n and p concentrations in oil palm seedlings but increased k concentration compared with irrigated treatments lee et al 2011 on the other hand found lower leaf nutrient concentrations for n p k and mg in irrigated palms 5 yap but higher rachis nutrient concentrations particularly for k and b and a larger storage of rachis p k s and b contents due to a larger increase in dry matter lee et al 2014 lee et al 2011 suggests that higher yields with irrigation demand larger amounts of plant nutrients to support optimal growth and yield which is reflected by lower leaf nutrient concentrations furthermore leaching losses of soluble nutrients k and mg are expected to be higher with irrigation lee et al 2011 despite efforts to ensure nutrients were non limiting with fertilization leaf nutrient concentrations for p and k were deficient in all treatments whilst rachis p k and mg concentrations were excessive indicating a nutritional imbalance in the palm particularly for p and k rachis concentrations were largest with the i1f1 treatment supporting the hypothesis that palms grown under more favourable conditions have higher rachis nutrient concentrations and are able to store larger amounts of nutrients lee et al 2014 given the nutritional imbalance between the leaf and rachis it is therefore essential to consider the nutrients stored in the reserve tissues i e rachis as well as the leaf while preparing fertilizer recommendations foster and prabowo 2006 for example to increase a deficient concentration of leaf p if rachis p is satisfactory an increase in either fertilizer n or fertilizer k is generally effective depending on whether n or k is most deficient to increase a deficient concentration of leaf k if rachis k is satisfactory an increase in fertilizer n is generally effective foster and prabowo 2006 given these complex interactions further research is required to determine optimal application rates of specific nutrients following a 4r nutrient stewardship ipni 2012 approach with and without irrigation because the yield in the control treatment i0f0 improved from year 1 to year 3 table 1 it is likely that the actual yield response with irrigation and fertilizer was underestimated yield improvements were most likely due to better management in trial plots but it is also possible that water and nutrient poaching from neighbouring plots occurred since oil palm roots can spread laterally up to 25 m from the trunk carr 2011 the i0f0 average yield for year 1 therefore provides a better baseline for the water and nutrient limited yield giving a yg3 of 8 0 t ha 1 fb for comparison tittinutchanon et al 2008 reported fruit bunch yield increases of up to 10 t ha 1 to 28 t ha 1 with irrigation and high rates of fertilizer in thailand in a climate similar to that of ghana the increase in yield can be attributed to an increase in bunch number with little to no effect of bunch weight increases in bunch number were therefore most likely caused by improvements in the sex ratio and a reduction in the abortion of immature inflorescences 4 2 understanding mechanisms that determine yield fluctuations results from the multiple linear regression indicated that the period associated with inflorescence sex determination was most sensitive to drought and likely to contribute most to yield oscillations in ghana fig 6 however because of the unique vegetative structure of oil palm stem and leaves together with the long time lag between floral initiation and fruit bunch harvest causal links between environmental factors and yield are difficult to establish carr 2011 whilst the effects of water stress on oil palm are well known the extent to which the monthly yield cycles are affected is poorly understood corley and hong 1982 the environmental factor most likely to explain yield oscillations in regions with severe and regular annual dry seasons is the soil water supply henson and dolmat 2004 however because of the trial block s proximity to a river it is likely that palms in all treatments had access to water in the dry season due to a high water table which can modify the actual water deficit caliman and southworth 1998 while piezometer readings indicate the existence of a water table 2 m which was the limit of measurement at the onset of the long rains it is uncertain to which depth the palms extracted water exactly since no root profiles were done observations from cote d ivoire for example have shown that palms can access water from the soil at a depth of at least 5 m caliman 1992 and that large yields can be obtained under drier conditions when the lack of rainfall is compensated for by a high water table quencez et al 1987 given that all palms may have had access to groundwater this suggests that yield cycles were not solely regulated by the soil water supply in support of this whilst irrigation ameliorated the water deficit and increased fruit bunch yields the use of irrigation did not affect yield cycles fig 6 this is consistent with findings reported by chan et al 1985 foong and lee 2000 and kee and chew 1991 suggesting that yield cycles are controlled by factors other than rainfall corley and tinker 2016 alternatively henson and dolmat 2004 suggested that factors associated with dry conditions other than the soil water supply such as high temperature high atmospheric vapour pressure deficit and high evaporation rate may be involved in yield cycling all of which correlate well with rainfall in particular the stomata are considerably sensitive to vapour pressure deficit an increase in which causes the stomata to close even when there is a good water supply carr 2011 stomatal closure is therefore an important factor limiting photosynthesis and hence dry matter production in oil palm dufrene et al 1990 smith 1989 for example showed that high atmospheric vapour pressure deficits may limit production even in parts of the world where oil palm do not normally suffer from water stress while it can be expected that the use of sprinkler irrigation might overcome stomatal closure in dry air by wetting the soil surface and humidifying the atmosphere no evidence has been provided yet tittinutchanon et al 2008 it is therefore likely that atmospheric conditions were similar in the trial but measurements of stomatal conductance or vapour pressure deficit are required to confirm this annual cycles of meteorological variables other than rainfall may also contribute to yield cycle patterns henson and dolmat 2004 demonstrated that it was possible to match oscillations in solar radiation and evaporation rate with annual yield using appropriate time lags although the relationship may not be causal additionally legros et al 2009 assumed that seasonal peaks of ﬂowering in oil palm are controlled by photoperiod response within a phytomer even at oil palm sites close to the equator they further suggest these patterns are confounded with drought effects that affect fruit bunch yield with long time lags but results remain to be confirmed using a modelling approach combres et al 2013 also suggested the involvement of photoperiod in bunch production dynamics whilst dufrene et al 1990 observed that sunlight and vapour pressure deficit combined may explain variations in maximal yield between west africa and southeast asia it is therefore possible that present monthly yield may be affected by multiple past stress events at different time lags before harvest which complicates attempts to understand the effects of climate in the absence of external constraints it has been proposed that yield cycles are regulated by endogenous mechanisms whereby current yield levels may impact future bunch number through sex differentiation and abortion corley 1977 however it has been argued that the time lags involved in these processes would not readily lead to annual yield cycles unless abortion levels were high and sex differentiation occurred at a relatively late stage henson and dolmat 2004 4 3 managing oil palms under water stress in west africa where rainfall patterns are characterized by a long and short rainy season and a long and short dry season irregular patterns in production are typical for all treatments 15 of the annual bunch production in year 3 was harvested in february with as little as 4 in low crop months fig 5 understanding local yield cycles of oil palm is of economic importance because the volume of fruit in the peak month determines the size of the mill and hence the scale of investment needed by a plantation corley and tinker 2016 furthermore irregular distribution of production has several consequences for plantation management including lack of milling capacity during peak crop months and underutilization in the production trough lack of sufficient harvesters in the peak months resulting in extended harvest intervals and crop loss and fluctuations in fruit bunch oil content with in particular a sharp drop at the end of the dry season nouy et al 1999 forecasting future yields on a monthly basis therefore helps plantation managers to better plan labour and milling requirements and is also useful to marketers as forward selling of palm oil is common corley and tinker 2016 because climate is becoming increasingly unpredictable the need for simple predictive models to forecast future yields will therefore become more essential in plantation management a practical way of reducing annual fluctuations in production is to plant a mixture of planting materials with different yield patterns corley and tinker 2016 as demonstrated in north sumatra nouy et al 1996 and benin cros et al 2013 implying that genetic diversity partly regulates the annual bunch production profile in oil palm or by partially disbudding palms to shift yield peaks out of phase and reducing yield fluctuations of the area as a whole corley 1977 management implications to mitigate the effect of water stress on oil palm include the use of irrigation to correct water deficits planting in sites with a high water table adequate drainage to remove excess water since prolonged flooding is known to reduce stomatal conductance and gas exchange processes photosynthesis and transpiration and to kill young palms lamade et al 1998 preventing water runoff on sloping terrain e g contour planting terraces appropriate frondstacking techniques improving structure in compact soils to allow for better root development mulching with organic materials e g empty fruit bunches to reduce soil surface evaporation and removal of inflorescences on young oil palms to stimulate root development and improve drought tolerance caliman 1992 carr 2011 furthermore potassium k is an essential macronutrient needed in large amounts by oil palm and is directly involved in several physiological processes including transport of assimilates and stomatal regulation taulya 2013 k is therefore essential in avoiding water loss during water stress situations maintaining adequate plant k with balanced fertilization is thus important for plant drought resistance wang et al 2013 5 conclusions results of the trial show the potential of irrigation and fertilizer to close yield gaps in mature oil palm stands in ghana average fb yields of 32 6 t ha 1 were obtained with a combination of irrigation and fertilizer while fb yields with irrigation only averaged 28 5 t ha 1 fb the benefit of adding fertilizer with irrigation was therefore estimated at 4 1 t ha 1 fb which is approximately equivalent to 0 9 t ha 1 crude palm oil cpo at 21 oil extraction rate oer fertilizer was therefore essential for a maximum response to irrigation but information on which nutrients are most important and optimal application rates are lacking to ensure balanced nutrition in oil palm with irrigation while yield increases were mostly caused by increases in bunch number annual yield cycles persisted despite the use of irrigation irregular distribution of production leads to lack of mill capacity and insufficient harvesters in the peak crop months many factors have been proposed that cause these fluctuations both external and endogenous indicating a complicated interaction of several components yield cycles and yield determining process es therefore remain unclear and require

11009,extensive irrigation strategies are commonly and widely used for orchards in northern china leading to low water use efficiency wue and potential fertilizer pollution of underground water effective micro irrigation strategies for orchards remain unclear and require further investigation to assist in developing orchard water saving irrigation systems in this study compared with local traditional furrow irrigation six micro irrigation strategies with or without mulch film were applied to a 6 year old cherry prunus avium l field for three years 2015 2017 the moisture spatial distribution of soil profile water consumption yield and fruit quality were measured to evaluate the effectiveness of different irrigation strategies on growth and wue of cherry trees the results showed that the strongest variability of moisture in soil profile was in the 0 60 cm soil layer indicating the water uptake of cherry trees is closely related to the soil moisture content in this region compared with furrow irrigation micro irrigation strategies can significantly p 0 05 reduce the water consumption of cherry trees without reducing yield and treatments with mulch film will further enhance this effect ring drip irrigation with mulch film and parallel drip irrigation with mulch film significantly p 0 05 improved wue furthermore parallel drip irrigation with mulch film at

we are experiencing a continuous global water crisis dos santos et al 2017 pieper et al 2018 schindler and donahue 2006 yu 2011 in which nearly 80 of the world s population is threatened by water security issues mcintyre et al 2010 the shortage of water has restricted the sustainable development of agriculture and threatened food security and resulted in a slowdown of socioeconomic development freire gonzález et al 2017 hadadin et al 2010 hanjra and qureshi 2010 ledger et al 2013 agricultural irrigation accounts for 70 of water withdrawals and 80 90 of water consumption jägermeyr et al 2015 however increasing competition for water in the wake of rapid population growth accelerating urbanization and global warming will necessarily reduce water supplies for agricultural irrigation frisvold and konyar 2012 piao et al 2010 consequently there is a great challenge to produce an adequate yield with reduced irrigation water inputs scientists have paid great attention to using various micro irrigation strategies to improve the water use efficiency wue of crops to maintain an adequate yield camp 1998 çolak et al 2018 gärdenäs et al 2005 namara et al 2007 reynolds et al 1995 some typical

output with reduced irrigation water inputs while maintaining high wue for annual field crops ibragimov et al 2007 compared the effects of drip irrigation and traditional furrow irrigation on cotton growth to show that drip irrigation saved 18 42 of the irrigation water and also increased irrigation wue reyes cabrera et al 2016 indicated drip irrigation increased irrigation wue of potato and reduced water use comparing with the traditional seepage irrigation praharaj et al 2016 pointed out that sprinkler irrigation was effective in precision irrigation scheduling which resulted in a higher wue over the flood irrigation sarkar et al 2008 found the yield of onion increased with increasing sprinkler applied water but the maximum wue was obtained at a moderate water application level

characteristics of cherry water uptake to indicate that a variable drip irrigation strategy can minimize useless irrigation water yang et al 2013 reported that alternate drip irrigation was more conducive to evenly wetting the whole root zone which significantly increased the hydraulic conductivity of young pear tree resulting in the increase of wue ismail et al 2013 investigated vegetative

vegetative and root growth parameters reflecting in improved fruit quality and wue similar results indicating the positive effects of micro irrigation on crop growth yield and wue of crops have been confirmed by many other studies dehghanisanij et al 2007 fang et al 2018 fentabil et al 2016 paris et al 2018 praharaj et al 2016 in addition agronomic measures such as mulch film are usually combined

crops and perennial fruit trees in terms of micro irrigation strategies details such as soil moisture spatial distribution effective wetting depth and agronomic measures for perennial fruit trees

soil was ploughed in the middle of october every year and chicken manure organic fertilizer was used as the base fertilizer for all the treatments at an application rate of 4 5 kg m 2 irrigation and fertilization were carried out at key stages of cherry tree growth to replenish water and nutrients the amount and time of irrigation and fertilization for furrow irrigation followed the local traditional methods obtained from the local orchard manager which was used as the control treatment the irrigation amount of the control treatment was 70 mm at every irrigation event at the leaf spreading stage early april flowering stage middle and late april and fruit enlargement stage early may to maintain comparability between the control treatment and micro irrigation treatments during every growth stage the same schedules for irrigation and fertilization were performed for all six micro irrigation treatments for example the time of irrigation and fertilization was almost similar and a reduced irrigation amount of 45 mm was performed in each irrigation event during the growth stage not including the stage after harvest groundwater pumped from wells was used as irrigation water for furrow irrigation and the six micro irrigation treatments the irrigation amount for the micro irrigation treatments was calculated using the following equation 1 i 10hp θ u θ l where i is the amount of irrigation mm h is the designed wetting depth cm in this paper the monitoring depth for soil moisture was 120 cm due to the root depth of the investigated cherry tree is in the range of 0

mode for furrow irrigation compound fertilizer n p k 2 1 0 5 was first spread on the ground and then irrigation was performed to leach the fertilizer into soil at the leaf spreading stage early april flowering stage middle and late april and fruit enlargement stage early may in the local traditional manner the application amount was 600 750 and 750 kg hm 2 for 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively water soluble fertilizer n p k 1 8 1 1 8 was applied through the irrigation event at the flowering stage middle and late april and fruit enlargement stage early may for the six micro irrigation treatments the application amount was 150 225 and 225 kg hm 2 for 2015 2016 and 2017 respectively weeding was carried out after the flowering stage middle and late april every 20 25 d a pruning operation was carried out at the leaf spreading stage early april and fruit enlargement stage early may and a pulling operation was performed at the leaf spreading stage early april flowering stage middle and late april fruit enlargement stage early may and mature stage june respectively 2 4 yield and quality all of the cherry fruits from a tree were picked to be weighed to calculate the yield at the harvest stage of which 40 fruits were selected from each tree for the quality test the content of total soluble solids was measured with a hand held digital sugar meter palette pr32 atago co ltd tokyo japan the contents of organic acids ascorbic acids and nitrate nitrogen were measured by the standard association of official analytical chemists aoac analysis method aoac 2012 2 5 evapotranspiration and wue cherry evapotranspiration et mm was estimated using the soil water balance method following eq 2 and wue kg m 3 was calculated by the following eq 3 fang et al 2018 zhang et al 2008 2 et p i δsmv

parameters were also obtained from surfer 12 0 the box chart for soil moisture data distribution was drawn with originpro 2018 originlab corporation massachusetts usa the goal of this research was to study the difference between micro irrigation strategies and the local traditional furrow irrigation strategy therefore the affecting factors of irrigation amount fertilization irrigation modes and mulch film were assumed to be combined into one factor i e irrigation strategy during the statistical analysis process under this assumption one way anova spss 15 0 ibm usa was used for significance tests and the differences between treatments were determined by duncan s multiple range test 3 results 3 1 spatial distribution of moisture in soil profile the spatial distribution of moisture in soil profile before and after several water addition events such as 45 mm irrigation 26 mm accumulated precipitation and 182 mm accumulated precipitation are displayed in the supporting information si figs s1 s7 the results demonstrate that both irrigation and rainfall had obvious effects on the spatial distribution of soil moisture in the soil profile and the greater the amount of water the greater the impact the micro irrigation treatments irrigated mainly the main root system of the cherry trees for example rdm rd stm and st treatments irrigated the circular area within 80 cm of the trunk pdm and pd treatments irrigated the 0 100 cm horizontal range area of the trunk therefore the soil moisture of the 0 100 cm range area of the trunk of the six micro irrigation modes increased by 9 16 20 3 after two days of 45 mm irrigation water added but that of the 100 200 cm range area of the trunk increased just by 3 12 15 3 and no obvious difference was observed between the treatments with or without mulch film si figs s1 s7 a1 and a2 however there was an increasing tendency of moisture content in the whole soil monitoring section of fi treatment in addition the spatial distribution of soil moisture under two accumulated precipitation amounts i e small precipitation of 26 mm and large precipitation of 182 mm were determined as shown in si figs s1 s7 b1 and b2 c1 and c2 respectively the average moisture content of the soil profile increased by 5 41 after three days of 26 mm precipitation and 29 24 after three days of 182 mm precipitation but there was no obvious difference between different irrigation treatments mulch film may prevent water from low levels of rainfall from entering the soil under 182 mm precipitation the average moisture content of treatments without mulch film and treatments with mulch film increased by 30 15 and 30 29 respectively however under 26 mm precipitation the average increase of moisture content in treatments without mulch film was 7 86 whereas that in treatments with mulch film was only 2 55 3 2 variation of soil moisture spatial distribution a box chart of soil moisture under different irrigation treatments during 2015 2017 is displayed in fig 2 no obvious difference in soil moisture was observed among the different irrigation treatments the mean value of soil moisture was relatively close and the rd pdm and pd treatments had a more uniform moisture distribution based on the interannual soil moisture spatial distribution data sets statistical parameters obtained from surfer 12 0 table 2 showed that the soil moisture spatial distribution was affected by different irrigation modes as well as with or without mulch film the average soil moisture of the 0 120 cm soil profile for different irrigation treatments decreased in the following order stm st rd pdm fi rdm pd in which the maximum moisture treatment was stm 24 99 and the minimum moisture treatment was pd 23 53 with the increase of soil depth the average soil moisture content of different irrigation treatments increased gradually by 36 3 46 2 according to the spatial variability of soil moisture in different layers the average coefficient of variation cv of the 0 60 cm soil layer was 0 12 0 17 which was obviously higher than that in the 60 120 cm soil layer 0 06 0 09 in conclusion the interannual fluctuation of soil moisture data sets reduced with the increase of soil depth and the deeper soil layer held more water 3 3 water consumption of cherry tree at different growth stages the water consumption of cherry trees under different irrigation treatments is shown in table 3 the results for 2015 2017 showed that the highest water consumption rate wcr of cherry trees was the period from flowering to maturity and the wcr was also significantly affected by different irrigation treatments the wcr of the fi treatment was significantly p 0 05 higher than that of other treatments the wcr of treatments without mulch film was higher than that of treatments with mulch film but no significant differences were observed in most treatments only ring drip and parallel drip irrigation treatments at the fruit expansion stage in 2015 ring drip treatments at the flowering stage in 2016 and parallel drip treatments at the harvest stage in 2017 indicated significant differences p 0 05 in terms of total water consumption amount et during the growth period as the cherry tree grew its et values increased the sum of et values of the six micro irrigation treatments plus fi treatment for 2015 2017 were 4053 4251 and 4685 mm respectively furthermore the et value for fi was significantly higher than that of the six micro irrigation treatments p 0 05 compared with the corresponding treatments without mulch film the et values for the rdm treatment in 2015 and the pdm treatment in 2016 showed a significant decrease p 0 05 3 4 yield wue and fruit quality the fi treatment with the largest irrigation amount also obtained the largest yield in 2015 and 2017 but no significant difference was found from the micro irrigation treatments the difference in yield between the six micro irrigation treatments was also not significant fig 3 the wue results showed that micro irrigation treatments with mulch film micro irrigation irrigation treatments without mulch film fi treatment and the wue of the rdm and pdm treatments in 2015 and the rdm treatment in 2016 were significantly p 0 05 higher than that of fi treatment fig 3 in addition compared with fi treatment the fruit quality may have been reduced by micro irrigation treatments table 4 a significant decrease p 0 05 of soluble solid content rd pd and st treatments in 2015 rdm rd and pdm treatments in 2016 titratable acid content rdm rd pdm and pd treatments in 2017 and vitamin c content rdm and stm treatments in 2017 were observed 4 discussion 4 1 designed wetting depth the main purpose of irrigation is to supply water to the root zone of soil to maintain appropriate soil moisture regardless of the irrigation strategy used so as to ensure the sustained water absorption of roots meet the water requirements for crop growth and development the importance of soil moisture spatial distribution of profile affecting the growth and development of crop have been confirmed li and liu 2011 puértolas et al 2015 yuan et al 2003 the designed wetting depth would influence the soil moisture spatial distribution of the profile which deserves further discussion in this paper the results of data sets from 2015 to 2017 for all the treatments demonstrated obvious variability of soil moisture spatial distribution cv 0 1 at 0 60 cm soil depth a 6 year old cherry tree was used in this study whose roots were mainly distributed in the 10 60 cm soil layer the tree tends to directly use the soil water of the main root zone resulting in the obvious spatial variability of soil moisture at 0 60 cm soil depth which indicates that the soil moisture in this soil layer is mainly related to the water consumption of cherry trees this finding was supported by previous reports cao et al 2018 robles and botía 2016 sun et al 2016 micro irrigation treatments indicated greater variability at 0 20 cm soil depth in which the cv value of pdm pd and stm treatments was higher than 0 2 for fi treatment the variability between different soil depths was relatively similar because of the plane infiltration pattern caused by furrow irrigation in addition deep soil water may play a supplementary role to shallow soil moisture but this complementary effect is slow so deep soil showed no obvious spatial variability a suitable value for wetting depth of soil is not only good for water saving but also beneficial to soil permeability microorganism growth and wue ibragimov et al 2007 zhang et al 2017 we suggest therefore the average designed wetting depth of 60 cm as a reference for scheduling micro irrigation practices during a 6 year old cherry growing season 4 2 micro irrigation mode in general the choice of micro irrigation mode mainly depends on soil texture water sources crop types and local agronomic measures jalota et al 2006 martin and miller 1983 rowe et al 2014 in this paper irrigation water was taken from well water with low sediment and salt which is optimal for any type of micro irrigation furthermore analysis of the labor cost for repairing damaged emitter and drip tap and weeding as well as wue and quality of cherry under different micro irrigation treatments provide a reference for determining the correct method for the specific conditions aujla et al 2007 rowe et al 2014 six micro irrigation treatments were applied to a 6 year old cherry loam field and the data of labor cost and wue of cherry trees showed that treatments with mulch film can greatly save labor cost by for example reducing the number of damages to emitter and drip tape and shortening time required for once weeding table 4 two treatments i e ring drip irrigation with mulch film and parallel drip irrigation with mulch film significantly p 0 05 improved wue compared with local traditional furrow irrigation similar results have been reported in previous research bond and grundy 2001 hou et al 2010 qin et al 2016 wang et al 2011 which confirmed that micro irrigation with mulch film increased the soil temperature and water storage in the root zone as well as reduced weed growth surface evaporation and damage of the micro irrigation line this resulted in an improvement in the yield wue and economic factors of crops however micro irrigation treatments may reduce soluble solids organic acids and vitamin c content and the reason for this reduction of quality needs to be further investigated because there are many factors that determine the quality of fruit in addition note that in this study neglecting surface runoff and deep drainage may have caused overestimation of et with the soil water balance method on the occasion of a high cumulative rainfall event of 182 mm overall a comprehensive comparison of yield wue economic factors and quality revealed that parallel drip irrigation with mulch film can be recommended as a micro irrigation mode for a 6 year old cherry field 5 conclusion in this study six micro irrigation treatments with or without mulch film and local traditional furrow irrigation were compared to study the effectiveness of different irrigation strategies on growth and wue of cherry trees in order to optimize irrigation parameters the moisture spatial distribution of soil profile water consumption yield and fruit quality of cherry trees were analyzed the region with the strongest variability of moisture in soil profile was 0 60 cm soil layer coefficient of variation 0 1 showing that the water uptake of cherry trees was closely related to the soil moisture content in this region and timely supplementation of water in this area is beneficial to cherry tree growth compared with furrow irrigation the range of et is 695 27 757 28 mm micro irrigation treatments the range of et is 571 39 675 44 mm can significantly p 0 05 reduce values of et of cherry trees without reducing yield and treatments with mulch film the range of et is 530 75 656 96 mm will further enhance this effect although there is no significant difference in wue among the six micro irrigation treatments compared with furrow irrigation ring drip irrigation with mulch film significantly p 0 05 improved wue in 2015 and 2016 and parallel drip irrigation with mulch film significantly p 0 05 improved wue in 2015 however micro irrigation treatments may reduce soluble solids organic acids and vitamin c content which needs further determination the results demonstrate that parallel drip irrigation with mulch film is the suitable irrigation mode for a 6 year old cherry field in terms of both wue yield fruit quality and maintenance cost and suggest the depth of the designed wetting layer should be controlled below 60 cm of the surface we provide an effective micro irrigation strategy to improve the wue of cherry trees nevertheless more specific fertilization strategy during micro irrigation requires further

effective micro irrigation strategies for orchards remain unclear and require further investigation to assist in developing orchard water saving irrigation systems in this study compared with local traditional furrow irrigation six micro irrigation strategies with or without mulch film were applied to a 6 year old cherry prunus avium l field for three years 2015 2017 the moisture spatial distribution of soil profile water consumption yield and fruit quality were measured to evaluate the effectiveness of different irrigation strategies on growth and wue of cherry trees the results showed that the strongest variability of moisture in soil profile was in the 0 60 cm soil layer indicating the water uptake of cherry trees is closely related to the soil moisture content in this region compared with furrow irrigation micro irrigation strategies can significantly p 0 05 reduce the water consumption of cherry trees without reducing yield and treatments with mulch film will further enhance this effect ring drip irrigation with mulch film and parallel drip irrigation with mulch film significantly p 0 05 improved wue furthermore parallel drip irrigation with mulch film at a designed wetting depth of 60 cm was suggested irrigation strategy for a 6 year old cherry field in terms of wue yield fruit quality and maintenance cost the findings of this study provide a typical

freire gonzález et al 2017 hadadin et al 2010 hanjra and qureshi 2010 ledger et al 2013 agricultural irrigation accounts for 70 of water withdrawals and 80 90 of water consumption jägermeyr et al 2015 however increasing competition for water in the wake of rapid population growth accelerating urbanization and global warming will necessarily reduce water supplies for agricultural irrigation frisvold and konyar 2012 piao et al 2010 consequently there is a great challenge to produce an adequate yield with reduced irrigation water inputs scientists have paid great attention to using various micro

growth to show that drip irrigation saved 18 42 of the irrigation water and also increased irrigation wue reyes cabrera et al 2016 indicated drip irrigation increased irrigation wue of potato and reduced water use comparing with the traditional seepage irrigation praharaj et al 2016 pointed out that sprinkler irrigation was effective in precision irrigation scheduling which resulted in a higher wue over the flood irrigation sarkar et al 2008 found the yield of onion increased with increasing sprinkler applied water but the maximum wue was obtained at a moderate water application level

vegetative and root growth parameters reflecting in improved fruit quality and wue similar results indicating the positive effects of micro irrigation on crop growth yield and wue of crops have been confirmed by many other studies dehghanisanij et al 2007 fang et al 2018 fentabil et al 2016 paris et al 2018 praharaj et al 2016 in addition agronomic measures such as mulch film are usually combined

experiments to study the effect of drip irrigation on crop yield and wue under plastic mulch suggesting an optimum drip irrigation regime with mulch film to obtain higher yield and wue in later studies results revealed that crop grown with mulch film had greater yield and wue than that of treatments without mulch film zhang et al 2017 and further demonstrated a moderate phosphorus and an intermediate rate of nitrogen applied under drip irrigation with mulch film can achieve acceptable wue yield and quality yang et al 2017 although there have been many achievements in annual field crops and perennial fruit trees in terms of micro irrigation strategies details such as soil moisture spatial distribution effective wetting depth and agronomic measures for perennial fruit trees under different micro irrigation strategies remain unclear and further investigation is therefore needed to help develop a systematic micro irrigation strategy cherry prunus avium l is an important economic fruit with the largest fruit trees cultivated area in china cao et al 2018 and can provide a typical reference for further research on the micro irrigation strategy for perennial fruit trees

between different irrigation treatments mulch film may prevent water from low levels of rainfall from entering the soil under 182 mm precipitation the average moisture content of treatments without mulch film and treatments with mulch film increased by 30 15 and 30 29 respectively however under 26 mm precipitation the average increase of moisture content in treatments without mulch film was 7 86 whereas that in treatments with mulch film was only 2 55 3 2 variation of soil moisture spatial distribution a box chart of soil moisture under different irrigation treatments during 2015 2017 is displayed in fig 2 no obvious difference in soil moisture was observed among the different irrigation treatments the mean value of soil moisture was relatively close and the rd pdm and pd treatments had a more uniform moisture distribution based on the interannual soil moisture spatial distribution data sets statistical parameters obtained from surfer 12 0 table 2 showed that the soil moisture spatial distribution was affected by different irrigation modes as well as with or without mulch film the average soil moisture of the 0 120 cm soil profile for different irrigation treatments decreased in the following order stm st rd pdm fi rdm pd in which the maximum moisture treatment was stm 24 99 and the minimum moisture treatment was pd 23 53 with the increase of soil depth the average soil moisture content of different irrigation treatments increased gradually by 36 3 46 2 according to the spatial variability of soil moisture in different layers the average coefficient of variation cv of the 0 60 cm soil layer was 0 12 0 17 which was obviously higher than that in the 60 120 cm soil layer 0 06 0 09 in conclusion the interannual fluctuation of soil moisture data sets reduced with the increase of soil depth and the deeper soil layer held more water 3 3 water consumption of cherry tree at different growth stages the water consumption of cherry trees under different irrigation treatments is shown in table 3 the results for 2015 2017 showed that the highest water consumption rate wcr of cherry trees was the period from flowering to maturity and the wcr was also significantly affected by different irrigation treatments the wcr of the fi treatment was significantly p 0 05 higher than that of other treatments the wcr of treatments without mulch film was higher than that of treatments with mulch film but no significant differences were observed in most treatments only ring drip and parallel drip irrigation treatments at the fruit expansion stage in 2015 ring drip treatments at the flowering stage in 2016 and parallel drip treatments at the harvest stage in 2017 indicated significant differences p 0 05 in terms of total water consumption amount et during the growth period as the cherry tree grew its et values increased the sum of et values of the six micro irrigation treatments plus fi treatment for 2015 2017 were 4053 4251 and 4685 mm respectively furthermore the et value for fi was significantly higher than that of the six micro irrigation treatments p 0 05 compared with the corresponding treatments without mulch film the et values for the rdm treatment in 2015 and the pdm treatment in 2016 showed a significant decrease p 0 05 3 4 yield wue and fruit quality the fi treatment with the largest irrigation amount also obtained the largest yield in 2015 and 2017 but no significant difference was found from the micro irrigation treatments the difference in yield between the six micro irrigation treatments was also not significant fig 3 the wue results showed that micro irrigation treatments with mulch film micro irrigation irrigation treatments without mulch film fi treatment and the wue of the rdm and pdm treatments in 2015 and the rdm treatment in 2016 were significantly p 0 05 higher than that of fi treatment fig 3 in addition compared with fi treatment the fruit quality may have been reduced by micro irrigation treatments table 4 a significant decrease p 0 05 of soluble solid content rd pd and st treatments in 2015 rdm rd and pdm treatments in 2016 titratable acid content rdm rd pdm and pd treatments in 2017 and vitamin c content rdm and stm treatments in 2017 were observed 4 discussion 4 1 designed wetting depth the main purpose of irrigation is to supply water to the root zone of soil to maintain appropriate soil moisture regardless of the irrigation strategy used so as to ensure the sustained water absorption of roots meet the water requirements for crop growth and development the importance of soil moisture spatial distribution of profile affecting the growth and development of crop have been confirmed li and liu 2011 puértolas et al 2015 yuan et al 2003 the designed wetting depth would influence the soil moisture spatial distribution of the profile which deserves further discussion in this paper the results of data sets from 2015 to 2017 for all the treatments demonstrated obvious variability of soil moisture spatial distribution cv 0 1 at 0 60 cm soil depth a 6 year old cherry tree was used in this study whose roots were mainly distributed in the 10 60 cm soil layer the tree tends to directly use the soil water of the main root zone resulting in the obvious spatial variability of soil moisture at 0 60 cm soil depth which indicates that the soil moisture in this soil layer is mainly related to the water consumption of cherry trees this finding was supported by previous reports cao et al 2018 robles and botía 2016 sun et al 2016 micro irrigation treatments indicated greater variability at 0 20 cm soil depth in which the cv value of pdm pd and stm treatments was higher than 0 2 for fi treatment the variability between different soil depths was relatively similar because of the plane infiltration pattern caused by furrow irrigation in addition deep soil water may play a supplementary role to shallow soil moisture but this complementary effect is slow so deep soil showed no obvious spatial variability a suitable value for wetting depth of soil is not only good for water saving but also beneficial to soil permeability microorganism growth and wue ibragimov et al 2007 zhang et al 2017 we suggest therefore the average designed wetting depth of 60 cm as a reference for scheduling micro irrigation practices during a 6 year old cherry growing season 4 2 micro irrigation mode in general the choice of micro irrigation mode mainly depends on soil texture water sources crop types and local agronomic measures jalota et al 2006 martin and miller 1983 rowe et al 2014 in this paper irrigation water was taken from well water with low sediment and salt which is optimal for any type of micro irrigation furthermore analysis of the labor cost for repairing damaged emitter and drip tap and weeding as well as wue and quality of cherry under different micro irrigation treatments provide a reference for determining the correct method for the specific conditions aujla et al 2007 rowe et al 2014 six micro irrigation treatments were applied to a 6 year old cherry loam field and the data of labor cost and wue of cherry trees showed that treatments with mulch film can greatly save labor cost by for example reducing the number of damages to emitter and drip tape and shortening time required for once weeding table 4 two treatments i e ring drip irrigation with mulch film and parallel drip irrigation with mulch film significantly p 0 05 improved wue compared with local traditional furrow irrigation similar results have been reported in previous research bond and grundy 2001 hou et al 2010 qin et al 2016 wang et al 2011 which confirmed that micro irrigation with mulch film increased the soil temperature and water storage in the root zone as well as reduced weed growth surface evaporation and damage of the micro irrigation line this resulted in an improvement in the yield wue and economic factors of crops however micro irrigation treatments may reduce soluble solids organic acids and vitamin c content and the reason for this reduction of quality needs to be further investigated because there are many factors that determine the quality of fruit in addition note that in this study neglecting surface runoff and deep drainage may have caused overestimation of et with the soil water balance method on the occasion of a high cumulative rainfall event of 182 mm overall a comprehensive comparison of yield wue economic factors and quality revealed that parallel drip irrigation with mulch film can be recommended as a micro irrigation mode for a 6 year old cherry field 5 conclusion in this study six micro irrigation treatments with or without mulch film and local traditional furrow irrigation were compared to study the effectiveness of different irrigation strategies on growth and wue of cherry trees in order to optimize irrigation parameters the moisture spatial distribution of soil profile water consumption yield and fruit quality of cherry trees were analyzed the region with the strongest variability of moisture in soil profile was 0 60 cm soil layer coefficient of variation 0 1 showing that the water uptake of cherry trees was closely related to the soil moisture content in this region and timely supplementation of water in this area is beneficial to cherry tree growth compared with furrow irrigation the range of et is 695 27 757 28 mm micro irrigation treatments the range of et is 571 39 675 44 mm can significantly p 0 05 reduce values of et of cherry trees without reducing yield and treatments with mulch film the range of et is 530 75 656 96 mm will further enhance this effect although there is no significant difference in wue among the six micro irrigation treatments compared with furrow irrigation ring drip irrigation with mulch film significantly p 0 05 improved wue in 2015 and 2016 and parallel drip irrigation with mulch film significantly p 0 05 improved wue in 2015 however micro irrigation treatments may reduce soluble solids organic acids and vitamin c content which needs further determination the results demonstrate that parallel drip irrigation with mulch film is the suitable irrigation mode for a 6 year old cherry field in terms of both wue yield fruit quality and maintenance cost and suggest the depth of the designed wetting layer should be controlled below 60 cm of the surface we provide an effective micro irrigation strategy to improve the wue of cherry trees nevertheless more specific fertilization strategy during micro irrigation requires further
