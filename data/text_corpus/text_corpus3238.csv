increasingly intensified human activity has profoundly altered the global biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen resulting in serious problems in environmental management and human health smith et al 1999 wastewater both municipal and industrial wastewater as one of the human activity consequences has become a major source of anthropogenic nitrogen deposition into the environment garrido amador et al 2021 furthermore the increasing discharged wastewater poses a heavy burden on the energy supply since wastewater treatment is an energy intensive industry 0 36 0 67 kwh m3 guo et al 2021 yang and chen 2021 on the other hand many countries have issued stringent discharge standards for wwtps to prevent waterbody from contamination the cas process created over a century is still the core technology for sewage treatment hitherto however in the current stage cas cannot meet the sustainable development of wwtps because it requires large land area and intensive energy input therefore upgrades to the conventional biological process are urgently required both for performance improvement and energy savings hao et al 2020 granular sludge technology represents the next century wastewater treatment van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 it is defined as pellets with a diameter from 0 14 to 5 mm formed by the natural self immobilization of bacteria the average pellet size of 200 µm is the threshold that differentiates granules from flocs dai et al 2020 schmidt and ahring 1996 in 1980 granular sludge was first reported in strictly anaerobic systems to show excellent performance in energy consuming and biogas production lettinga et al 1980 lim and kim 2014 the subsequently developed nrgs including ags and angs expanded the application of granular sludge technology from cod removal to nitrogen removal morgenroth et al 1997 van dongen et al 2001 ags requires aeration and external carbon to ensure the simultaneous nitrification and denitrification which is completed by the cooperation of various functional microorganisms purba et al 2020 it is considered the most important breakthrough offspring of cas and set to become a new standard process for aerobic treatment of wastewater franca et al 2018 winkler and van loosdrecht 2022 anaob anaerobically convert ammonium to dinitrogen gas using nitrite as the electron acceptor strous et al 1999 anaob have a high self aggregation ability due to their large hydrophobic surface and high eps production which induces the formation of angs ali et al 2018 jia et al 2021 angs is an innovative technology for removing ammonium nitrogen from wastewater without aeration and carbon input kuenen 2020 nrgs allows retention of a high amount of biomass due to its compact structure and excellent settling ability contributing to its improved nitrogen removal capacity environmental stress tolerance and waste sludge reduction nrgs is generally cultivated in reactors with a high height diameter ratio endowing an effective use of the vertical space compared with cas nrgs can greatly reduce space requirements and construction costs abma et al 2010 van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 therefore nrgs is considered as an environmental friendly technology to achieve carbon and energy neutrality in wastewater treatment worldwide there are approximately 40 and 66 full scale ags and angs systems respectively driessen and hendrickx 2021 sepulveda mardones et al 2019 however the bottlenecks in treating low strength wastewater e g municipal wastewater including the long term start up period unpredictable instability and difficulty in incorporating it into the existing treatment process have hindered the burgeoning momentum of nrgs lin et al 2020 wang et al 2022 studies of nrgs have progressed over the past two decades but the present understanding in this area is still a tip of the iceberg the initial studies on nrgs mostly focused on start up and performance enhancement while that of nrgs properties have only been initiated in recent years the bibliometric analysis based on the web of science reveals that the number of articles about nrgs and nrgs characterization has increased gradually in recent years fig 1 notably the microbiome and eps are two of the most studied topics involved in nrgs as well as some novel properties of nrgs such as strength and color have gained attention meanwhile upgrades to characterization technologies can cover more properties and further improve the understanding of nrgs the aim of this review is to provide an overview of nrgs from the perspective of characterization it discusses the integrated nitrogen removal pathways of nrgs and its application in the treatment of various wastewaters summarizes the current advances in nrgs characterization compares the pros and cons of currently available characterization technologies and puts forward the issues that require further studies this review is expected to provide a systematic summary linking nrgs properties with performance and broadening the methodological perspectives of nrgs characterization 2 integrated microbial nitrogen transformation inside nrgs integrating multiple nitrogen transformation pathways inside granules in a single reactor is a prominent advantage of nrgs in contrast cas system requires the spatial movement of activated sludge through multiple compartments anoxic and aerobic zones for nitrogen removal the microbial nitrogen transformation and functional microorganisms in ags and angs are illustrated in fig 2 the functional microorganisms inside ags are stratified based on varying redox conditions i e aob and nob reside in the outer layer to convert ammonium to nitrate with access to sufficient dissolved oxygen db locate deep inside anoxic areas of the granules and convert nitrate to nitrogen gas nancharaiah and reddy 2018 organic pollutants also participate in heterotrophic denitrification as electron providers in ags systems enabling the simultaneous removal of nitrogen and carbon in angs anaob are responsible for converting ammonium to nitrogen gas with nitrite as the electron acceptor so far anaob are not available in pure culture and they generally live in a symbiotic relationship with other microorganisms inside angs peeters and van niftrik 2019 van der star et al 2008 for practical application of anammox process in wastewater treatment pn a and pd a are developed in single stage or two stage configurations which both provide novel pathways for nitrogen removal from wastewater speth et al 2016 xu et al 2020 in a single stage granular pn a system aob accumulate in the outer layer of granules or flocs and convert part of the influent ammonium into nitrite then nitrite and residual ammonium are transferred to the inner layer of angs for anammox process ali et al 2016 for a single stage granular pd a system the influent nitrate is first reduced to nitrite by db and subsequently consumed by anaob as the electron acceptor xu et al 2020 the integration of nitrogen transformation steps in nrgs systems could improve efficiency and lower construction costs 3 performance of nrgs in treatment of various wastewaters compared with cas ags possesses advantages of efficient nitrogen removal with a low sludge production and excellent biomass retention capacity de sousa rollemberg et al 2019 furthermore ags is more stable than cas in the presence of environmental inhibitors e g fluctuating loading rates toxic compounds as the dense structure of granular sludge can alleviate these negative stresses he et al 2021 nancharaiah and reddy 2018 previous studies of ags concentrated on stability while studies of cas focused on pollutants removal implying that application of ags is hindered by stability sepulveda mardones et al 2019 a bibliometric analysis of angs revealed that angs system could achieve a mean nitrogen removal efficiency of approximately 81 1 higher than that of biofilm 80 8 and flocs 74 1 suggesting that the granular format is more beneficial to nre liu et al 2020a additionally full scale application of pn a system with up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors granular system could sustain the highest average nitrogen load compared with sequencing batch reactor and moving bed biofilm reactor installations lackner et al 2014 the performances of nrgs technology employed for the treatment of varying wastewaters including domestic wastewater petrochemical wastewater landfill leachate and digestate are listed in table 1 the organic carbon requirement differentiated the wastewater that is suitable for using ags or angs ags technology is suited for treating wastewater with a relatively high c n ratio approximately 7 5 the influent organic matters serve as the electron donor for denitrification achieving simultaneous removal of carbon and nitrogen franca et al 2018 generally ags performed better nre than cas hasebe et al 2017 sepulveda mardones et al 2019 for example ags achieved a significantly higher nitrogen removal performance than anaerobic oxic process and oxidation ditch in a full scale application 59 6 vs 25 3 22 7 although they were comparable in removing cod and ammonium li et al 2014b nevertheless for real wastewater treatment nre and stability of ags system can be limited by the availability of high fraction of particulate organic matters haaksman et al 2020 wagner et al 2015 anammox based technology has shown excellent performance in treating high ammonium wastewater 300 2000 mg l at relatively high temperature 30 40 c with a low c n ratio 1 cao et al 2016b li et al 2020 mao et al 2017 tomaszewski et al 2017 at present pn a has gained the most interests in the full scale application of anammox based processes as the organic matters in the influent would accelerate the proliferation of heterotrophic bacteria and inhibit anaob function the pre capture of organic matters e g high rate activated sludge anaerobic digestion is necessary before anammox based process to avoid negative effects of the influent cod on anaob collectively nrgs exhibits satisfactory nitrogen removal performance in most cases with reduced energy input especially for angs technology the carbon harvest process prior to angs enables the decoupling of carbon and nitrogen removal being a feasible strategy to achieve carbon neutrality however several challenges remain for the reliable full scale application of nrgs technology i the operational stability of the nrgs systems and the working status are unpredictable in mainstream wastewater treatment and ii the maintenance of nrgs effectiveness is difficult when treating toxic industrial wastewater e g petrochemical wastewater textile wastewater franca et al 2018 kang et al 2020 weralupitiya et al 2021 given the strong associations between granule properties and performance a comprehensive understanding of nrgs properties could be the key to surmount these obstacles 4 advances and technologies in characterization of nrgs the studies on nrgs properties have been initiated in recent years with increasing attention since these findings could support the fine regulation of nrgs systems for enhancing performance in this section the characterization of nrgs is summarized in terms of nrgs properties and characterization technologies 4 1 characterization of nrgs physical properties the physical properties of nrgs introduced include size color strength microstructure and viscoelasticity these properties can be regarded as direct responses of nrgs to environmental variables such as temperature hydraulic shear force and influent composition enabling them to be used as diagnostic tools or improvement approaches for nrgs systems 4 1 1 characterization of granule size the characterization of granule size is generally carried out using wet sieved image analysis with microscopy and laser diffraction suja et al 2015 verawaty et al 2013 zhu et al 2018 among these technologies laser diffraction is the most commonly used one attributing to its high efficiency and simple execution supported by laser particle size analyzer since characterization of granule size is relatively simple to conduct this property has received massive research attention and a strong linkage has been proved between granule size and pollutant removal performance of the system generally granules that are too small do not retain sufficient biomass while granules that are too large would increase mass transfer limitations within granules and are prone to flotation chen et al 2010 trego et al 2020 therefore performance is not always positively correlated with granule size for angs granules with a size of 0 5 0 9 mm were found to present the highest nitrogen removal rate 60 6 mg n g vss h compared with granules of 0 2 0 5 mm 23 8 mg n g vss h and 2 0 2 5 mm 42 1 mg n g vss h zhu et al 2018 likewise ags with a medium size exhibited better nitrogen removal performance than the larger ones li et al 2019 meanwhile cooperation of nitrogen transformation microorganisms has been found among varying sized angs small granules were nitrite donors that provide sufficient nitrite for anammox process with a larger aerobic functional zone large granules were nitrite recipients with the enrichment of anaob chen et al 2020a wang et al 2014 on the other hand flocs diameter 0 2 mm could coexist with granules diameter 0 2 mm in the granular systems because granulation and disintegration processes co occur in reactors in some cases an occurrence of a fraction of flocs in the granular systems favors the performance for example biomass segregation was observed in a one stage pn a system where heterotrophic bacteria resided within the flocs and anaob resided within the granules when srtflocs hrt such ecological niche differentiation protects anaob from the disturbance of heterotrophic bacteria moreover heterotrophic bacteria could provide additional nitrite for anammox by reduction of nitrate to nitrite thereby favoring the anammox process chen et al 2020b nevertheless with an increasing proportion of flocs from 10 to 40 an obvious decline in nre ca 87 88 to ca 41 49 occurred and flocs were also proved to be mainly responsible for n2o emissions 60 even though they constituted only 10 biomass in an angs reactor liu et al 2020b zhuang et al 2020 therefore the potential negative impacts of floccular biomass on the system performance cannot be ignored collectively these findings put forward a requirement of granule size management to maximize the function of nrgs and minimize the risk of granule disintegration and n2o emissions studies have shown that nrgs with appropriate size is conducive to nre which can be achieved by optimizing hydraulic stress force such as the installation of hydrocyclones or screens kosgey et al 2021 however as the commonly used factor average size is not always precise to reflect the performance of granular systems other parameters such as aggregate morphology size distribution and volume surface mean diameter could be included to establish the correlations between granule size and nre bao nguyen et al 2021 costa et al 2022 xu et al 2021b 4 1 2 color color is a visual feature of nrgs especially for angs as anaob the representative member of angs present a carmine appearance due to harboring a series of heme c proteins which are responsible for the microbial activity of anaob kartal and keltjens 2016 a more reddish appearance of angs is generally believed to indicate higher performance therefore color could be a direct indicator reflecting the microbial activity of angs systems the introduction of the equation of l a b color space has allowed the quantitative color characterization of angs kang et al 2020 in l a b color space the value of l characterizes brightness and ranges from 0 to 100 the values of a and b vary from 128 to 127 and positive a and b values indicate pure red and yellow hues respectively fig s1 a digital value of surface color could be detected with a spectrophotometer the chroma of angs under different nitrogen loading rates was calculated with the equation a 2 b 2 a significant correlation was found between the average chroma value and saa saa 188 21 chroma 28 10 r 0 940 p 0 01 demonstrating the feasibility of chromaticity as a visual indicator of angs systems in addition to inferring activity the granule color reveals some details of granulation for instance color heterogenous angs were reported to present function segregation during its enlargement wang et al 2020a specifically dark red dr granules and bright red br granules co occurred in an angs system br granules contained significantly higher eps contents and were more viscous while dr granules had a more compact structure and higher mechanical intensity a self assemble model of these two color heterogeneous granules to the enlargement of angs was proposed i e dr granules served as a core to which br granules adhered and the continual growth of the adhered granules contributed to the enlargement of angs 4 1 3 strength measurement strength is another important property of granules and high strength granules are the basis for the long term stable operation of granular systems granules with a low strength cannot resist frequent hydrodynamic shear forces eventually leading to their disintegration while granules with very high intensity are prone to form large granules which lead to granules flotation wang et al 2019b thus assessing the mechanical strength of nrgs is critical to diagnose the operation status of granular systems four characterization methods are described herein including stirring measurement ultrasonic treatment rheological determination and optical coherence elastography stirring measurement and ultrasonic treatment are relatively simple methods that use easily attainable apparatus but the outcomes tend to be impacted by the manual operation rheological determination requires specific equipment which harvests more accurate and detailed results the granule intensity measurement by the oce technique could overcome some limitations of rheometry but the operation and analyses are more complex 4 1 3 1 stirring measurement stirring measurement is the earliest established method to measure the strength of microbial granules pereboom 1997 the strength is reflected by the abrasion of granules when they are exposed to different shear rates in a stirred tank so an abrasion rate coefficient k has been introduced to indicate the strength of granules xing et al 2015 the analytical equipment has evolved from a stirred flask to a stirred tank with a standard reactor geometry e g glass cylinder to achieve an accurate abrasion rate for granules through stirring measurement ags cultivated with synthetic wastewater exhibited stronger strength lower value of k than ags cultivated with sewage de graaff et al 2020 this finding proved that granules cultivated by different wastewaters possess varying strength which further suggests that maintaining a high granule strength is urgently required to ensure the operation of nrgs in the full scale application 4 1 3 2 ultrasonic treatment ultrasonic treatment is one of the most popular techniques for measuring the strength of concrete materials and this technology has also been introduced to evaluate the strength of granules benaicha et al 2015 wan et al 2013 randomly selected granules were treated with ultrasonic waves and then measured spectrophotometrically at 600 nm a600 at a series of timepoints wan et al 2013 the variation of the a600 value reflects the integrity of granules because granule disintegration will cause an increase in turbidity which can be reflected by the a600 value the faster the curve fitted by the a600 value at different timepoints approaches steady the lower the resistance and strength of the sample fig s2a also granule strength can be measured by the granulation rate of samples after ultrasonic treatment long et al 2019 long et al 2016 4 1 3 3 rheological determination to theoretically elucidate the mechanical intensity of nrgs rheological parameters have been introduced and evaluated by the controlled stress and strain rheometer lin and wang 2017 seviour et al 2009 wang et al 2019b during the measurement the storage modulus g loss modulus g and complex viscosity η changes with the time dependent strain γ fig s2b yield stress τ g γ is used to reflect the intensity of granules the rheological measurement revealed that angs exhibits a high intensity and possesses gel properties and a positive correlation was found between granule intensity τ and saa τ 0 349 exp 11 689 saa 2 832 r2 0 974 implying a close relationship between granular strength and nre of angs lin and wang 2017 wang et al 2019b based on these findings control of hydrodynamic shear force was proposed to maintain the effectiveness of angs under varying scenarios such as different nitrogen loadings and temperatures wang et al 2019b 4 1 3 4 application of optical coherence elastography the newest use of oce to characterize the mechanical intensity of granules has several advantages over rheometry e g oce can probe spatially heterogeneous mechanical properties and conduct in situ measurements of granules in aqueous solutions liou et al 2019 the oce technique works by measuring the propagating elastic waves in a sample and the wave speed is converted to the viscoelastic properties by inverse modeling in the test the layered viscoelastic properties of ags were examined by measuring the speed of circumferential waves in the samples and calculated with the two layered theoretical model finally the shear moduli and shear viscosities of the outer layer 8 41 kpa 0 37 pa s and the inner core 4 84 kpa 0 20 pa s were obtained for the ags this work for the first time provided in situ non destructive quantitative characterization of the layered viscoelastic properties of granular biofilms which cannot be obtained by employing other available technologies liou et al 2021 4 1 4 characterization of the microstructure of nrgs effective in situ imaging is of great importance to explore the microstructure of the unique spherical microbial aggregates visualization of the microstructure also helps to accurately assess the mass transfer efficiency that significantly affects the nre of nrgs pan et al 2016 tan et al 2020 conventional methods applied to visualize nrgs include optical microscopy 200 µm scanning electron microscopy 1 nm 6 nm and transmission electron microscopy 0 2 nm which are ordered by increasing resolution lemaire et al 2008 lin and wang 2017 tay et al 2001 the newly developed imaging technologies mri and x ray tomography stand out with the advanced equipment that allows the effective in situ visualization of the internal structure of granules as well as circumvention of the potential damages from the pretreatment for traditional microscopy methods however the high analytical costs determine that the two technologies cannot be used as regular tools 4 1 4 1 magnetic resonance imaging mri nmr has the superiority of intact detection of the granule internal structure and is more sensitive to different arrays of physical and chemical parameters than traditional microscopy methods as and lens 2001 mri can detect the distribution of nmr active nuclei commonly 1h relaxation times and diffusional and advective transport an image contrast between water and the granule results from the difference in the t1 relaxation time longitudinal and the t2 relaxation time transverse and the combination of the t1 and t2 weighted images enables the location of granules constituents in spatial and time scale for example t1 weighted images fig 3 demonstrated that ags fed with municipal wastewater or synthetic wastewater were structurally heterogenous with respect to variable density eps cell clusters and water voids kirkland et al 2020 furthermore self diffusion coefficients of water molecules within granules and the granule structure obtained by nmr imaging are correlated thereby giving valuable insights into the relationship between granule structure and substrate diffusion van den berg et al 2020 the transport and retention behavior of micro particles in real time inside the granular sludge bed was also vividly captured by mri most micro particles from the influent were retained in reactors hydrolyzed inside granules or discharged later ranzinger et al 2020 the application of mri in nrgs characterization include but not limited to providing valuable insights into the internal structure further application can be extended to detect the evolution of structure during the disintegration or flotation observe the multiphase flow and solute transport and monitor the environmental behavior of emerging contaminants when flowing into nrgs 4 1 4 2 x ray tomography x ray tomography provides direct and non destructive three dimensional images of the interior of optically opaque materials with a resolution varying from tens to 1 μm to date x ray tomography has been used to characterize biological and structural materials mainly by using obtained 3d images to clarify the deformation and fracture mechanisms buffiere et al 2010 the 3d construction of the interior structure of the granule as well as the pore size distribution can be collected by x ray tomography with related software the microstructure of angs was studied using x ray tomography to explore the effect of agnps on substrate diffusion in angs and the agnps treated angs had larger pore size and porosity compared with the original angs fig 4 a b peng et al 2019 the synchrotron confocal µ x ray fluorescence analysis also provided direct confirmation of distinct impacts of agnps on the granules i e ca fe and total elements were transferred to a deeper depth inside granules after adding 1 mm agnps fig 4c the scanning projections from x ray computed tomography also facilitated the characterization of the granule permeability the 3d images of angs with different sizes were reconstructed revealing that the pore distribution changed evidently with increasing size forming a denser surface layer that reduced the angs permeability xu et al 2021a 4 1 5 viscoelastic behaviors of nrgs viscoelastic behaviors of eps are crucial to the regulation of granulation process of nrgs felz et al 2020a qcm d uses acoustic waves to measure changes in frequency and dissipation of a quartz crystal sensor when samples are deposited onto the sensor rudolph et al 2021 since quartz crystal microbalance can be operated in liquids a condition that is applicable for biological samples it has been instrumental in biointerface research shi and liu 2021 qcm d analytic technology has been utilized to harvest data for a comprehensive understanding of nrgs granulation for instance stratified eps extracted from angs was analyzed using qcm d to characterize the initial adhesion of anammox consortia in this test the stratified eps were diluted and injected into qcm d analyzer to record the changes of frequency δf and dissipation energy δd over time fig s3 the greatest decrease velocity of frequency of the loosely boundeps revealed that it had the strongest adherence among the three fractions soluble eps loosely bound eps and tightly bound eps the slope of δd over δf indicates the induced energy dissipation per coupled unit mass as the absolute value of the slope increases so do the viscosity and loose structure of the adhered biomolecules layer this study demonstrated that the initial cell aggregation of angs was initiated by the bacteria themselves through secreting adhesion molecules on the surface rather than by eps wang et al 2020c the qcm d analytic results also revealed that floccular eps was more adhesive and tended to form stable layers on the mineral surface stimulating the initial granulation of ags subsequently the sludge eps became less adhesive to the abiotic surface during aerobic granulation providing more contact sites for biomolecules and bacteria to favor the structure and stability of ags shi and liu 2021 qcm d analytic technology provides unprecedented insight into the underlying process of granulation with a particular focus on the eps surface interplay greatly deepening our theoretical understanding of this phenomenon but the potential effects of eps extracting process the surface adsorption and binding orientation should be considered during eps evaluation easley et al 2021 4 2 characterization of nrgs chemical properties eps has attracted prominent attention in the study of nrgs chemical properties fig 1 due to the fact that eps play a crucial role in accelerating the granulation of flocs as well as maintaining the integrity and stability of nrgs jia et al 2017 xia et al 2018 zhu et al 2012 for example eps bonding model is the most widely used model to explain the granulation process among several models selection pressure model inert nuclei model surface tension model adams et al 2022 however eps have been called the dark matter of biofilms given the large range of matrix biopolymers and the difficulty in analyzing them flemming et al 2007 therefore the application of advanced technologies are highly required in the study for eps of nrgs 4 2 1 assessment of the eps contents eps are biopolymers produced by microorganisms and accounted for over 90 of the dry mass of biofilms flemming and wingender 2010 eps contents could be roughly classified into five parts including proteins polysaccharides nucleic acids lipids and other biopolymers proteins and polysaccharides are the two fractions that received significantly more research interests the colorimetric method is the primary way to quantify the eps composition that owns superiorities in costs efficiency and excecution while the detection range is limited in contrast 3d eem can differentiate dissolved organic matter and ftir can detect the fundamental structure of eps components but they are favoured options of qualitative approaches rather than quantitative approaches the large amounts of data obtained by colorimetric method have revealed a consensus that the eps of nrgs has a much higher protein polysaccharide ratio than that of flocs guo et al 2017 zhu et al 2012 nevertheless the colorimetric method has some limitations such as a lack of standardized protocols making this method less precise and comparable also some specific compositions e g sialic acids cannot be detected and quantified due to its low response to certain colorimetric methods de graaff et al 2019 ras et al 2008 to overcome these limitations 3d eem can be used as a supplementary tool to extend the detection range 3d eem is characterized by a high sensitivity and selectivity and employed to qualitatively and semi quantitatively determine fluorescence compounds in organic dissolved matter aromatic protein like and tryptophan protein like substances are detected as key fractions to support the stability of nrgs wang et al 2021 zhu et al 2012 however its determination of fluorescent compounds is too ambiguous for molecular characterization ftir is a non destructive and real time analytical method it can qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the molecular composition of cell parts based on vibrations of the functional groups of different cell contents and has been widely used in microbiology research galichet et al 2001 sheng et al 2006 in nrgs related studies ftir is utilized to investigate the surface properties of nrgs or uncover the impact of environmental pollutants on the eps of nrgs for example the abundance of hydrophilic groups i e c oh c o and coo of carboxylate groups was detected by ftir and revealed that these hydrophilic groups were significantly lower in angs than in activated sludge favoring the granulation of flocs wang et al 2021 ftir also offered a remarkable insight into the protein secondary structure α helix β sheet random coil and β turn with data processing of the amide i region of ftir spectra at 1700 1600 cm 1 the ratio of α helix β helix random coil can be used to assess the protein structure and a lower ratio suggests a looser structure with more exposed hydrophobic groups facilitating the granulation hou et al 2015 as for uncovering the response of nrgs systems to environmental stress for instance changes in hydroxyl groups amides and polysaccharides were considered responsible for the decreased nre when ags was exposed to perfluorooctanoic acid yang et al 2020 the variations in specific functional groups displayed by ftir provides a deeper insight into the response of nrgs systems to stressful circumstances 4 2 2 the identification of specific constituents in eps the rough classification of eps components ignores the diversity in composition and structure which hinders our deep understanding of the accurate eps composition yu 2020 meanwhile identification of the key eps biopolymers in nrgs has always been a challenge due to the difficulty in non destructive eps extraction and its precise match with a poorly studied database boleij et al 2018 tan et al 2015 additionally these issues also require a high degree of molecular biological knowledge and skills despite these difficulties recent studies have tried to unravel the molecular constituents of eps from nrgs to help establish more efficient and sustainable wastewater treatment systems feng et al 2021 yu 2020 indeed relying on the combination of chromatography and other molecular characterization techniques table 2 fig 5 more eps components have been identified and characterized most of the current identified constituents are saccharide based polymers and they are all characterized to facilitate the stability of nrgs sialic acids are a group of monosaccharides that have been detected in eps from both ags and angs through staining and quantification boleij et al 2020 de graaff et al 2019 they maintain the stability of granule structure by supplying a net negative charge to bind calcium cations and masking the penultimate galactose residues to avoid the degradation of the sugar chain feng et al 2021 lin et al 2013 there are two components of exopolysaccharide that have been identified granulan has been successfully purified by fractional precipitation and preparatory scale gel permeation chromatography it is a gel forming exopolysaccharide which was deemed to form self assemble symmetric antiparallel helices to strengthen the stability of gels determined by molecular dynamics simulation techniques seviour et al 2010 seviour et al 2012 alginate like exopolysaccharides have been identified in ags by chemical spectroscopic and electrophoresis analysis and it contributes to the physical structure of ags with gel form lin et al 2010 glycosaminoglycans are linear heteropolysaccharides of eps which tend to be overlooked by commonly used colorimetric methods using ftir and staining the presence of glycosaminoglycans in ags and angs was confirmed they were presumed to function in attracting cations forming hydrogel binding proteins and signaling in biological processes boleij et al 2020 felz et al 2020b analyzed by mass spectrometry a highly abundant glycoprotein was identified in the eps of angs boleij et al 2018 according to previous research these glycoproteins were postulated to support the formation of a gel matrix for structural stability as well as form an efficient protective layer against degradation for the slow growing microorganisms vanklinken et al 1995 the current literature reflects the gaps in our knowledge regarding granular eps which requires imminent establishment of combined multidisciplinary characterization methods for their identification and functional assignment 4 3 the characterization of nrgs biological properties biological characterization is a critical aspect that directly determines the pollutants removal performance of nrgs systems with the rapid development of molecular biological techniques the understanding of complex microbial communities in nrgs has been remarkably deepend fish is an effective tool to visualize the spatial distribution of specific microorganisms especially for studying dense bio aggregates like nrgs but the specific matching between probes and microorganisms makes the harvest of information for the whole microbiome difficult the amplicon sequencing could allow taxonomic classification and quantification of the microbiome which has been accepted as a routine tool for studying microbial community to date however without the information of the whole genome the data cannot be accounted for the macroscopical phenomenons from genetic level the invention of meta omics has increased the knowledge of the microbiome of nrgs by establishing direct connections between the system performance and functional macromolecules the meta omics technology will become more prevalent with improved analytic efficiency and declining cost 4 3 1 fluorescence in situ hybridization fish fish was initially adopted to classify chromosomes and has been widely used in medical and biological research since its invention in 1986 pinkel et al 1986 in situ hybridization aims to detect the presence of dna or rna sequences of interest and locate their position with specific probes that match the sequence probes for fish are labeled by fluorescein biotin or digoxigenin and the signals from hybridization can be visualized by fluorescent microscopy jensen 2014 specific probes carry different colors of fluorescence so microorganisms will be colorfully stained and the spatial distribution of functional microorganisms can be observed under the view of clsm semi quantification of functional microbial fractions can be achieved meantime in a work that cultivated anaob and n damo microorganisms in a membrane granular sludge reactor fish clsm results showed that the granules formed a clear layered structure that anaob located in the outer layers of the granules while n damo microorganisms located inside the granules fig s4 fan et al 2020 on the basis of fish analysis the niche differentiation of the targeted functional microorganisms can be uncovered and the subsequent optimization strategy can be taken to regulate the microbial composition for performance improvement for instance in an ags reactor fish results showed that glycogen accumulating organisms a competitive organism against paos accumulated on the top of the sludge bed while paos were dominant at the bottom accordingly the sludge from the top of the sludge bed was discarded contributing to the enrichment of paos and complete phosphorus removal bassin et al 2012 4 3 2 the application of amplicon sequencing with years of development amplicon sequencing has been widely popular in detecting the overarching shifts in microbial communities because of its modest cost and broad applicability garner et al 2021 amplicon sequencing is commonly applied to the 16s rrna gene which is universal to both bacteria and archaea caporaso et al 2011 its utilization has permitted for the description of the microbial community with higher coverage and fidelity due to the difference in operational conditions ags tend to develop more complex and diverse microbiome than angs trego et al 2020 in a review summarizing the microbial composition of ags microorganisms such as rhodocyclaceae xanthomonadaceae comamonadaceae and rhodobacteraceae were frequently detected implying that ags contains a common core bacterial community xia et al 2018 for angs planctomycetes proteobacteria and chloroflexi are the major phyla cao et al 2016a qian et al 2018 besides the core member anaob affiliated to planctomycetes filamentous chloroflexi are crucial in angs and function as the backbone of the granular structure the identification of core microorganisms was obtained attributing to the large scale database supported by the extensive use of amplicon sequencing generally the abundance of microorganisms obtained by amplicon sequencing is connected with performance of nrgs systems especially the dominant species or the ones present significant changes furthermore microbial interactions the keystone community and even the assembly mechanism of nrgs could be analyzed with suitable ecological models based on abundant 16s rrna gene sequencing data deng et al 2012 sloan et al 2007 however the limitations of this method are also significant i the use of improper primers will miss a certain fraction of microorganisms and ii the sequencing coverage is not sufficient to garner genomic data of targeted microbiota eisenstein 2018 these limitations of amplicon sequencing technology impeded its application in obtaining a thorough understanding of the microbial communities responsible for nitrogen transformation in nrgs 4 3 3 the application of meta omics the meta omics approaches can identify microbial species metabolic pathways and metabolites associated with the nutrients conversion process in nrgs providing detailed information about the functional microbiome its application in nrgs has made progress in several aspects such as the illumination of mutually beneficial relationships mechanistic understanding of granulation and uncover the response of nrgs systems to environmental stress at the molecular level the cog category analysis based on metagenomics compared the functional gene discrepancy of candidatus kuenenia from three sludge samples flocs biofilm and granules candidatus kuenenia in the granules interacted intensively with coexisting populations due to possessing more genes for signal transduction and defence mechanisms meanwhile candidatus kuenenia in flocs and biofilm showed more diverse cellular metabolism thus the cog category analysis elucidates for the first time that different sludge morphologies where anaob inhabit could induce a discrepancy in gene expression of anaob guo et al 2016 moreover the application of integrated multi omics amplicon metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing clarified functional discrepancy among angs with varying sizes larger granules were found to harbour higher species and functional diversity with a better habitat differentiation and enhanced heterogeneity than smaller granules but such increase in the diversity was limited to a certain range of granule size because functional redundancy appears when granules grow over a threshold value chen et al 2020a with meta omics techniques numerous vital studies have unravelled the cross feeding of metabolites exchange in the granular anammox community fig 6 the metatranscriptomic analysis highlighted the prevalence and complexity of interspecies cross feeding in angs because the biosynthetic pathways of certain amino acids and vitamins such as tyrosine phenylalanine and b vitamins were not expressed in the majority of anammox consortia in a pn a granular system wang et al 2019a specifically the mutualistic relationships between anaob and other members need to be combed and reconstructed metabolic pathways based on metagenomics elucidated several potential cross feedings in this microcosmos anaob ca brocadia donated acetate b vitamins and eps amino acids peptides to other residents while several abundant hb e g chloroflexi and chlorobi were missing these genes ji et al 2021 lawson et al 2017 wang et al 2019a on the other hand anaob also need exogenous support e g anaob obtained secondary metabolites molybdopterin cofactor and folate and amino acids methionine tryptophan and shikimate from other members such as armatimonadetes and proteobacteria ji et al 2021 wang et al 2019a zhao et al 2018b by comparing the functional gene abundance of dominant microorganisms a wise strategy was noticed of the heterotrophic auxotrophic genotypes to survive in the organic carbon deficient environment in the anammox community i e they improve the transcribed membrane transportation process but abandon costly amino acids biosynthesis wang et al 2019a during the accelerated aggregation of anammox granules a synchronous increase in the fructose 6 phosphate and udp n acetyl d glucosamine was observed these two metabolites participate in the biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides assisted by metabolomics this work for the first time unmasked the dynamic changes of metabolites hidden behind the anammox granulation process guo et al 2017 furthermore seven amino acids phenylalanine leucine alanine threonine glycine glutamate and valine involved in extracellular protein synthesis were found to be positively correlated with its production during granulation p 0 003 zhao et al 2018a indeed metabolic profiling further confirmed the vital role of eps during granulation of anammox consortium by detecting key metabolites associated with eps production 4 4 data driven modeling mathematical modeling is a powerful tool to understand complex processes that cannot be directly obtained through experiments allowing for evaluating multiple operating conditions and scenarios for wastewater treatment since the establishment of activated sludge models mathematical modeling has been widely applied in the field from academic research to engineering application boltz et al 2010 morgenroth et al 2002 mathematical modeling has also been used to simulate nrgs operation table 3 for example a one dimensional granule model was developed with embeded metabolisms of n damo microbes and anaob in activated sludge model type kinetics this granule model successfully reproduces nitrogen dynamics and distribution of functional microorganisms under highly different operational conditions a strategy based on simulation involving a short hrt and small granules was proposed to optimize system performance peng et al 2021 moreover an integrated mathematical model was proposed to clarify the potential mechanism of cavitation and flotation of angs this model matched well with the actual floating behavior of granules and keeping granule size 2 5 mm was proposed to avoid granule flotation especially with high substrate concentration tan et al 2020 thus the complex biological processes dunring nrgs can be properly understood by mathematical models nevertheless the necessity of considering a group of differential equations for process kinetics and mass transfer which are bound by conditions greatly limits the generalization ability of those models to make predictions ni and yu 2010 artificial intelligence based models are more adaptive in modeling intricate processes because they can establish relationships among highly non linear data el din et al 2004 machine learning is a set of algorithms in artificial intelligence that capable of autonomous acquisition and integration of knowledge which has been gradually applied in environmental fields for effluent quality prediction pipe system rehabilitation prediction and flood disaster management islam et al 2021 seshan et al 2014 winkler et al 2018 the attempt in nrgs began by using various models such as adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system support vector regression and artificial neuron network in ags to achieve process simulation and performance prediction liang et al 2020 zaghloul et al 2018 2020 in recent studies an ensemble of machine learning was developed with a good fit to model ags reactors a five stage machine learning model was proposed which could predict the performance of ags and explain the reason for predicted failures zaghloul et al 2021 although these properties are artificially classified as physical chemical biological and systematic their inherent associations cannot be overlooked for nrgs biological properties functional microorganisms are the fundamental ones that determine the whole system because physical properties are the macroscopical phenomenon regulated by microorganisms and their products while chemical properties mostly focus on the microbial products eps and the systematic properties are obtained by integrating the abovementioned properties the network of nrgs properties and performance are presented in fig 7 the performance of nrgs is impacted by multiple properties thus the combined evaluation of various properties during nrgs research is frequent and effective which can provide insights from different perspectives for one issue complementing or corroborating with each other 5 conclusions and prospects this review provides an overview of nrgs technology with a focus on properties characterization the dense structure that accommodates integrated microbial nitrogen transformation pathways enables the promising performance of nrgs in wastewater treatment while its application is still limited in treating mainstream wastewater research on the characterization of nrgs properties could be of great importance in addressing the current issues physical properties of nrgs such as size strength and color have presented direct and strong correlations with nre which can be used to evaluate the real time status of nrgs systems chemical properties that mostly refer to eps fractions have been demonstrated to play a crucial role in the start up and stability of nrgs systems biological properties have unraveled the diversified interactions among microorganisms within the micro niche which is fundamental to the system systematic properties using modeling have gained progress in optimizing and predicting system performance meanwhile the corresponding characterization technologies are exhibited highlighting their indispensable role in making continuous progress in this area moreover the inherent associations among these properties cannot be overlooked for obtaining a thorough understanding of nrgs this review also reflects the necessity of multidisciplinary background for researchers for advanced research to promote the application of nrgs furher efforts are highly desired in the following areas 1 develop fine regulation strategies to enhance nitrogen removal performance despite the increasing establishment of connections between nrgs operational status and its properties effective regulation strategies and practical implementation remain nascent which is important to establish a harmonious balance among nre system stability and operational cost recent studies on fine regulation were mainly conducted via controlling operation parameters and optimizing reactor configurations with the booming development of synthetic biology the bioengineering modification of core microorganisms and the establishment of engineered nrgs systems are promising as fundamental resolutions 2 illustrate the migration and transformation of toxic pollutants the real wastewater containing toxic pollutants such as humic acids azo dyes and crude oil emulsions would negatively impact the performance of nrgs systems describing the migration and transformation of these toxic pollutants during biological treatment using novel techniques like nmr dna stable isotope probing will accelerate the establishment of detoxification approaches and directional cultivation of nrgs 3 further explore granule eps based applications currently the important role of eps in maintaining the stability of nrgs is preliminarily illuminated by the identification of several functional compositions future studies can focus on establishing standardized and integrated techniques for extracting and identifying eps constituents and developing remedial measures for disintegration from the perspective of eps meanwhile the development of in situ approaches are necessary to study the spatial heterogeneity of granule eps which is ignored by eps extraction additionally eps contains valuable recyclable resources from wastewater treatment and granular sludge yielded significantly more eps than floccular sludge therefore efforts on resource recovery from granule eps should be emphasized to achieve an effective energy loop reducing the energy input and realizing a net zero impact 4 enrich understanding of nrgs as a micro niche the spherical structure of nrgs represents a unique ecological model on a spatial scale with the development of spatial analysis such as spatially resolved transcriptomics that can harvest data of high dimensionality the bioprocesses inside nrgs can be displayed in a more vivid way and functional groups can be studied separately according to the spatial position this will shed light on the microbiome of nrgs from a new level of dimensionality in nrgs systems each particle is a small but an intricate ecological system the increasing use of community ecology will provide brand new insights into nrgs studies 5 establish an integrated monitoring system the discovery of various mechanisms accounting for the deterioration of nrgs systems reveals that a single parameter cannot precisely reflect the conditions of nrgs systems therefore an integrated monitoring system based on multi parameters evaluation is needed to detect real time working status and predict the

16190,nitrogen removal granular sludge nrgs is a promising technology in wastewater treatment with advantages of efficient nitrogen removal less footprint lower sludge production and energy consumption and is a way for wastewater treatment plants to achieve carbon neutrality aerobic granular sludge ags and anammox granular sludge angs are two typical nrgs technologies that have attracted extensive attention mounting evidence has shown strong associations between nrgs properties and the status of nrgs systems however a holistic view is still missing the aim of this article is to provide an overview of nrgs with an emphasis on characterization specifically the integrated nitrogen transformation pathways inside nrgs and the performance of nrgs treating various wastewaters are discussed nrgs properties are categorized as physical chemical biological and systematical ones presenting current advances and corresponding characterization technologies finally the future prospects for furthering the mechanistic understanding and engineering application of nrgs are proposed overall the technological advancements in characterization have greatly contributed to understanding nrgs properties which are potential factors for optimizing the performance and evaluating the working status of nrgs this review will provide guidance in characterizing nrgs properties and boost the

increasingly intensified human activity has profoundly altered the global biogeochemical cycle of nitrogen resulting in serious problems in environmental management and human health smith et al 1999 wastewater both municipal and industrial wastewater as one of the human activity consequences has become a major source of anthropogenic nitrogen deposition into the environment garrido amador et al 2021 furthermore the increasing discharged wastewater poses a heavy burden on the energy supply since wastewater treatment is an energy intensive industry 0 36 0 67 kwh m3 guo et al 2021 yang and chen 2021 on the other hand many countries have issued stringent discharge standards for wwtps to prevent waterbody from contamination the cas process created over a century is still the core technology for sewage treatment hitherto however in the current stage cas cannot meet the sustainable development of wwtps because it requires large land area and intensive energy input therefore upgrades to the conventional biological process are urgently required both for performance improvement and energy savings hao et al 2020 granular sludge technology represents the next century wastewater treatment van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 it is defined as pellets with a diameter from 0 14 to 5 mm formed by the natural self immobilization of bacteria the average pellet size of 200 µm is the threshold that differentiates granules from flocs dai et al 2020 schmidt and ahring 1996 in 1980 granular sludge was first reported in strictly anaerobic systems to show excellent performance in energy consuming and biogas production lettinga et al 1980 lim and kim 2014 the subsequently developed nrgs including ags and angs expanded the application of granular sludge technology from cod removal to nitrogen removal morgenroth et al 1997 van dongen et al 2001 ags requires aeration and external carbon to ensure the simultaneous nitrification and denitrification which is completed by the cooperation of various functional microorganisms purba et al 2020 it is considered the most important breakthrough offspring of cas and set to become a new standard process for aerobic treatment of wastewater franca et al 2018 winkler and van loosdrecht 2022 anaob anaerobically convert ammonium to dinitrogen gas using nitrite as the electron acceptor strous et al 1999 anaob have a high self aggregation ability due to their large hydrophobic surface and high eps production which induces the formation of angs ali et al 2018 jia et al 2021 angs is an innovative technology for removing ammonium nitrogen from wastewater without aeration and carbon input kuenen 2020 nrgs allows retention of a high amount of biomass due to its compact structure and excellent settling ability contributing to its improved nitrogen removal capacity environmental stress tolerance and waste sludge reduction nrgs is generally cultivated in reactors with a high height diameter ratio endowing an effective use of the vertical space compared with cas nrgs can greatly reduce space requirements and construction costs abma et al 2010 van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 therefore nrgs is considered as an environmental friendly technology to achieve carbon and energy neutrality in wastewater treatment worldwide there are approximately 40 and 66 full scale ags and angs systems respectively driessen and hendrickx 2021 sepulveda mardones et al 2019 however the bottlenecks in treating low strength wastewater e g municipal wastewater including the long term start up period unpredictable instability and difficulty in incorporating it into the existing treatment process have hindered the burgeoning momentum of nrgs lin et al 2020 wang et al 2022 studies of nrgs have progressed over the past two decades but the present understanding in this area is still a tip of the iceberg the initial studies on nrgs mostly focused on start up and performance enhancement while that of nrgs properties have only been initiated in recent years the bibliometric analysis based on the web of science reveals that the number of articles about nrgs and nrgs characterization has increased gradually in recent years fig 1 notably the microbiome and eps are two of the most studied topics involved in nrgs as well as some novel properties of nrgs such as strength and color have gained attention meanwhile upgrades to characterization technologies can cover more properties and further improve the understanding of nrgs the aim of this review is to provide an overview of nrgs from the perspective of characterization it discusses the integrated nitrogen removal pathways of nrgs and its application in the treatment of various wastewaters summarizes the current advances in nrgs characterization compares the pros and cons of currently available characterization technologies and puts forward the issues that require further studies this review is expected to provide a systematic summary linking nrgs properties with performance and broadening the methodological perspectives of nrgs characterization 2 integrated microbial nitrogen transformation inside nrgs integrating multiple nitrogen transformation pathways inside granules in a single reactor is a prominent advantage of nrgs in contrast cas system requires the spatial movement of activated sludge through multiple compartments anoxic and aerobic zones for nitrogen removal the microbial nitrogen transformation and functional microorganisms in ags and angs are illustrated in fig 2 the functional microorganisms inside ags are stratified based on varying redox conditions i e aob and nob reside in the outer layer to convert ammonium to nitrate with access to sufficient dissolved oxygen db locate deep inside anoxic areas of the granules and convert nitrate to nitrogen gas nancharaiah and reddy 2018 organic pollutants also participate in heterotrophic denitrification as electron providers in ags systems enabling the simultaneous removal of nitrogen and carbon in angs anaob are responsible for converting ammonium to nitrogen gas with nitrite as the electron acceptor so far anaob are not available in pure culture and they generally live in a symbiotic relationship with other microorganisms inside angs peeters and van niftrik 2019 van der star et al 2008 for practical application of anammox process in wastewater treatment pn a and pd a are developed in single stage or two stage configurations which both provide novel pathways for nitrogen removal from wastewater speth et al 2016 xu et al 2020 in a single stage granular pn a system aob accumulate in the outer layer of granules or flocs and convert part of the influent ammonium into nitrite then nitrite and residual ammonium are transferred to the inner layer of angs for anammox process ali et al 2016 for a single stage granular pd a system the influent nitrate is first reduced to nitrite by db and subsequently consumed by anaob as the electron acceptor xu et al 2020 the integration of nitrogen transformation steps in nrgs systems could improve efficiency and lower construction costs 3 performance of nrgs in treatment of various wastewaters compared with cas ags possesses advantages of efficient nitrogen removal with a low sludge production and excellent biomass retention capacity de sousa rollemberg et al 2019 furthermore ags is more stable than cas in the presence of environmental inhibitors e g fluctuating loading rates toxic compounds as the dense structure of granular sludge can alleviate these negative stresses he et al 2021 nancharaiah and reddy 2018 previous studies of ags concentrated on stability while studies of cas focused on pollutants removal implying that application of ags is hindered by stability sepulveda mardones et al 2019 a bibliometric analysis of angs revealed that angs system could achieve a mean nitrogen removal efficiency of approximately 81 1 higher than that of biofilm 80 8 and flocs 74 1 suggesting that the granular format is more beneficial to nre liu et al 2020a additionally full scale application of pn a system with up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors granular system could sustain the highest average nitrogen load compared with sequencing batch reactor and moving bed biofilm reactor installations lackner et al 2014 the performances of nrgs technology employed for the treatment of varying wastewaters including domestic wastewater petrochemical wastewater landfill leachate and digestate are listed in table 1 the organic carbon requirement differentiated the wastewater that is suitable for using ags or angs ags technology is suited for treating wastewater with a relatively high c n ratio approximately 7 5 the influent organic matters serve as the electron donor for denitrification achieving simultaneous removal of carbon and nitrogen franca et al 2018 generally ags performed better nre than cas hasebe et al 2017 sepulveda mardones et al 2019 for example ags achieved a significantly higher nitrogen removal performance than anaerobic oxic process and oxidation ditch in a full scale application 59 6 vs 25 3 22 7 although they were comparable in removing cod and ammonium li et al 2014b nevertheless for real wastewater treatment nre and stability of ags system can be limited by the availability of high fraction of particulate organic matters haaksman et al 2020 wagner et al 2015 anammox based technology has shown excellent performance in treating high ammonium wastewater 300 2000 mg l at relatively high temperature 30 40 c with a low c n ratio 1 cao et al 2016b li et al 2020 mao et al 2017 tomaszewski et al 2017 at present pn a has gained the most interests in the full scale application of anammox based processes as the organic matters in the influent would accelerate the proliferation of heterotrophic bacteria and inhibit anaob function the pre capture of organic matters e g high rate activated sludge anaerobic digestion is necessary before anammox based process to avoid negative effects of the influent cod on anaob collectively nrgs exhibits satisfactory nitrogen removal performance in most cases with reduced energy input especially for angs technology the carbon harvest process prior to angs enables the decoupling of carbon and nitrogen removal being a feasible strategy to achieve carbon neutrality however several challenges remain for the reliable full scale application of nrgs technology i the operational stability of the nrgs systems and the working status are unpredictable in mainstream wastewater treatment and ii the maintenance of nrgs effectiveness is difficult when treating toxic industrial wastewater e g petrochemical wastewater textile wastewater franca et al 2018 kang et al 2020 weralupitiya et al 2021 given the strong associations between granule properties and performance a comprehensive understanding of nrgs properties could be the key to surmount these obstacles 4 advances and technologies in characterization of nrgs the studies on nrgs properties have been initiated in recent years with increasing attention since these findings could support the fine regulation of nrgs systems for enhancing performance in this section the characterization of nrgs is summarized in terms of nrgs properties and characterization technologies 4 1 characterization of nrgs physical properties the physical properties of nrgs introduced include size color strength microstructure and viscoelasticity these properties can be regarded as direct responses of nrgs to environmental variables such as temperature hydraulic shear force and influent composition enabling them to be used as diagnostic tools or improvement approaches for nrgs systems 4 1 1 characterization of granule size the characterization of granule size is generally carried out using wet sieved image analysis with microscopy and laser diffraction suja et al 2015 verawaty et al 2013 zhu et al 2018 among these technologies laser diffraction is the most commonly used one attributing to its high efficiency and simple execution supported by laser particle size analyzer since characterization of granule size is relatively simple to conduct this property has received massive research attention and a strong linkage has been proved between granule size and pollutant removal performance of the system generally granules that are too small do not retain sufficient biomass while granules that are too large would increase mass transfer limitations within granules and are prone to flotation chen et al 2010 trego et al 2020 therefore performance is not always positively correlated with granule size for angs granules with a size of 0 5 0 9 mm were found to present the highest nitrogen removal rate 60 6 mg n g vss h compared with granules of 0 2 0 5 mm 23 8 mg n g vss h and 2 0 2 5 mm 42 1 mg n g vss h zhu et al 2018 likewise ags with a medium size exhibited better nitrogen removal performance than the larger ones li et al 2019 meanwhile cooperation of nitrogen transformation microorganisms has been found among varying sized angs small granules were nitrite donors that provide sufficient nitrite for anammox process with a larger aerobic functional zone large granules were nitrite recipients with the enrichment of anaob chen et al 2020a wang et al 2014 on the other hand flocs diameter 0 2 mm could coexist with granules diameter 0 2 mm in the granular systems because granulation and disintegration processes co occur in reactors in some cases an occurrence of a fraction of flocs in the granular systems favors the performance for example biomass segregation was observed in a one stage pn a system where heterotrophic bacteria resided within the flocs and anaob resided within the granules when srtflocs hrt such ecological niche differentiation protects anaob from the disturbance of heterotrophic bacteria moreover heterotrophic bacteria could provide additional nitrite for anammox by reduction of nitrate to nitrite thereby favoring the anammox process chen et al 2020b nevertheless with an increasing proportion of flocs from 10 to 40 an obvious decline in nre ca 87 88 to ca 41 49 occurred and flocs were also proved to be mainly responsible for n2o emissions 60 even though they constituted only 10 biomass in an angs reactor liu et al 2020b zhuang et al 2020 therefore the potential negative impacts of floccular biomass on the system performance cannot be ignored collectively these findings put forward a requirement of granule size management to maximize the function of nrgs and minimize the risk of granule disintegration and n2o emissions studies have shown that nrgs with appropriate size is conducive to nre which can be achieved by optimizing hydraulic stress force such as the installation of hydrocyclones or screens kosgey et al 2021 however as the commonly used factor average size is not always precise to reflect the performance of granular systems other parameters such as aggregate morphology size distribution and volume surface mean diameter could be included to establish the correlations between granule size and nre bao nguyen et al 2021 costa et al 2022 xu et al 2021b 4 1 2 color color is a visual feature of nrgs especially for angs as anaob the representative member of angs present a carmine appearance due to harboring a series of heme c proteins which are responsible for the microbial activity of anaob kartal and keltjens 2016 a more reddish appearance of angs is generally believed to indicate higher performance therefore color could be a direct indicator reflecting the microbial activity of angs systems the introduction of the equation of l a b color space has allowed the quantitative color characterization of angs kang et al 2020 in l a b color space the value of l characterizes brightness and ranges from 0 to 100 the values of a and b vary from 128 to 127 and positive a and b values indicate pure red and yellow hues respectively fig s1 a digital value of surface color could be detected with a spectrophotometer the chroma of angs under different nitrogen loading rates was calculated with the equation a 2 b 2 a significant correlation was found between the average chroma value and saa saa 188 21 chroma 28 10 r 0 940 p 0 01 demonstrating the feasibility of chromaticity as a visual indicator of angs systems in addition to inferring activity the granule color reveals some details of granulation for instance color heterogenous angs were reported to present function segregation during its enlargement wang et al 2020a specifically dark red dr granules and bright red br granules co occurred in an angs system br granules contained significantly higher eps contents and were more viscous while dr granules had a more compact structure and higher mechanical intensity a self assemble model of these two color heterogeneous granules to the enlargement of angs was proposed i e dr granules served as a core to which br granules adhered and the continual growth of the adhered granules contributed to the enlargement of angs 4 1 3 strength measurement strength is another important property of granules and high strength granules are the basis for the long term stable operation of granular systems granules with a low strength cannot resist frequent hydrodynamic shear forces eventually leading to their disintegration while granules with very high intensity are prone to form large granules which lead to granules flotation wang et al 2019b thus assessing the mechanical strength of nrgs is critical to diagnose the operation status of granular systems four characterization methods are described herein including stirring measurement ultrasonic treatment rheological determination and optical coherence elastography stirring measurement and ultrasonic treatment are relatively simple methods that use easily attainable apparatus but the outcomes tend to be impacted by the manual operation rheological determination requires specific equipment which harvests more accurate and detailed results the granule intensity measurement by the oce technique could overcome some limitations of rheometry but the operation and analyses are more complex 4 1 3 1 stirring measurement stirring measurement is the earliest established method to measure the strength of microbial granules pereboom 1997 the strength is reflected by the abrasion of granules when they are exposed to different shear rates in a stirred tank so an abrasion rate coefficient k has been introduced to indicate the strength of granules xing et al 2015 the analytical equipment has evolved from a stirred flask to a stirred tank with a standard reactor geometry e g glass cylinder to achieve an accurate abrasion rate for granules through stirring measurement ags cultivated with synthetic wastewater exhibited stronger strength lower value of k than ags cultivated with sewage de graaff et al 2020 this finding proved that granules cultivated by different wastewaters possess varying strength which further suggests that maintaining a high granule strength is urgently required to ensure the operation of nrgs in the full scale application 4 1 3 2 ultrasonic treatment ultrasonic treatment is one of the most popular techniques for measuring the strength of concrete materials and this technology has also been introduced to evaluate the strength of granules benaicha et al 2015 wan et al 2013 randomly selected granules were treated with ultrasonic waves and then measured spectrophotometrically at 600 nm a600 at a series of timepoints wan et al 2013 the variation of the a600 value reflects the integrity of granules because granule disintegration will cause an increase in turbidity which can be reflected by the a600 value the faster the curve fitted by the a600 value at different timepoints approaches steady the lower the resistance and strength of the sample fig s2a also granule strength can be measured by the granulation rate of samples after ultrasonic treatment long et al 2019 long et al 2016 4 1 3 3 rheological determination to theoretically elucidate the mechanical intensity of nrgs rheological parameters have been introduced and evaluated by the controlled stress and strain rheometer lin and wang 2017 seviour et al 2009 wang et al 2019b during the measurement the storage modulus g loss modulus g and complex viscosity η changes with the time dependent strain γ fig s2b yield stress τ g γ is used to reflect the intensity of granules the rheological measurement revealed that angs exhibits a high intensity and possesses gel properties and a positive correlation was found between granule intensity τ and saa τ 0 349 exp 11 689 saa 2 832 r2 0 974 implying a close relationship between granular strength and nre of angs lin and wang 2017 wang et al 2019b based on these findings control of hydrodynamic shear force was proposed to maintain the effectiveness of angs under varying scenarios such as different nitrogen loadings and temperatures wang et al 2019b 4 1 3 4 application of optical coherence elastography the newest use of oce to characterize the mechanical intensity of granules has several advantages over rheometry e g oce can probe spatially heterogeneous mechanical properties and conduct in situ measurements of granules in aqueous solutions liou et al 2019 the oce technique works by measuring the propagating elastic waves in a sample and the wave speed is converted to the viscoelastic properties by inverse modeling in the test the layered viscoelastic properties of ags were examined by measuring the speed of circumferential waves in the samples and calculated with the two layered theoretical model finally the shear moduli and shear viscosities of the outer layer 8 41 kpa 0 37 pa s and the inner core 4 84 kpa 0 20 pa s were obtained for the ags this work for the first time provided in situ non destructive quantitative characterization of the layered viscoelastic properties of granular biofilms which cannot be obtained by employing other available technologies liou et al 2021 4 1 4 characterization of the microstructure of nrgs effective in situ imaging is of great importance to explore the microstructure of the unique spherical microbial aggregates visualization of the microstructure also helps to accurately assess the mass transfer efficiency that significantly affects the nre of nrgs pan et al 2016 tan et al 2020 conventional methods applied to visualize nrgs include optical microscopy 200 µm scanning electron microscopy 1 nm 6 nm and transmission electron microscopy 0 2 nm which are ordered by increasing resolution lemaire et al 2008 lin and wang 2017 tay et al 2001 the newly developed imaging technologies mri and x ray tomography stand out with the advanced equipment that allows the effective in situ visualization of the internal structure of granules as well as circumvention of the potential damages from the pretreatment for traditional microscopy methods however the high analytical costs determine that the two technologies cannot be used as regular tools 4 1 4 1 magnetic resonance imaging mri nmr has the superiority of intact detection of the granule internal structure and is more sensitive to different arrays of physical and chemical parameters than traditional microscopy methods as and lens 2001 mri can detect the distribution of nmr active nuclei commonly 1h relaxation times and diffusional and advective transport an image contrast between water and the granule results from the difference in the t1 relaxation time longitudinal and the t2 relaxation time transverse and the combination of the t1 and t2 weighted images enables the location of granules constituents in spatial and time scale for example t1 weighted images fig 3 demonstrated that ags fed with municipal wastewater or synthetic wastewater were structurally heterogenous with respect to variable density eps cell clusters and water voids kirkland et al 2020 furthermore self diffusion coefficients of water molecules within granules and the granule structure obtained by nmr imaging are correlated thereby giving valuable insights into the relationship between granule structure and substrate diffusion van den berg et al 2020 the transport and retention behavior of micro particles in real time inside the granular sludge bed was also vividly captured by mri most micro particles from the influent were retained in reactors hydrolyzed inside granules or discharged later ranzinger et al 2020 the application of mri in nrgs characterization include but not limited to providing valuable insights into the internal structure further application can be extended to detect the evolution of structure during the disintegration or flotation observe the multiphase flow and solute transport and monitor the environmental behavior of emerging contaminants when flowing into nrgs 4 1 4 2 x ray tomography x ray tomography provides direct and non destructive three dimensional images of the interior of optically opaque materials with a resolution varying from tens to 1 μm to date x ray tomography has been used to characterize biological and structural materials mainly by using obtained 3d images to clarify the deformation and fracture mechanisms buffiere et al 2010 the 3d construction of the interior structure of the granule as well as the pore size distribution can be collected by x ray tomography with related software the microstructure of angs was studied using x ray tomography to explore the effect of agnps on substrate diffusion in angs and the agnps treated angs had larger pore size and porosity compared with the original angs fig 4 a b peng et al 2019 the synchrotron confocal µ x ray fluorescence analysis also provided direct confirmation of distinct impacts of agnps on the granules i e ca fe and total elements were transferred to a deeper depth inside granules after adding 1 mm agnps fig 4c the scanning projections from x ray computed tomography also facilitated the characterization of the granule permeability the 3d images of angs with different sizes were reconstructed revealing that the pore distribution changed evidently with increasing size forming a denser surface layer that reduced the angs permeability xu et al 2021a 4 1 5 viscoelastic behaviors of nrgs viscoelastic behaviors of eps are crucial to the regulation of granulation process of nrgs felz et al 2020a qcm d uses acoustic waves to measure changes in frequency and dissipation of a quartz crystal sensor when samples are deposited onto the sensor rudolph et al 2021 since quartz crystal microbalance can be operated in liquids a condition that is applicable for biological samples it has been instrumental in biointerface research shi and liu 2021 qcm d analytic technology has been utilized to harvest data for a comprehensive understanding of nrgs granulation for instance stratified eps extracted from angs was analyzed using qcm d to characterize the initial adhesion of anammox consortia in this test the stratified eps were diluted and injected into qcm d analyzer to record the changes of frequency δf and dissipation energy δd over time fig s3 the greatest decrease velocity of frequency of the loosely boundeps revealed that it had the strongest adherence among the three fractions soluble eps loosely bound eps and tightly bound eps the slope of δd over δf indicates the induced energy dissipation per coupled unit mass as the absolute value of the slope increases so do the viscosity and loose structure of the adhered biomolecules layer this study demonstrated that the initial cell aggregation of angs was initiated by the bacteria themselves through secreting adhesion molecules on the surface rather than by eps wang et al 2020c the qcm d analytic results also revealed that floccular eps was more adhesive and tended to form stable layers on the mineral surface stimulating the initial granulation of ags subsequently the sludge eps became less adhesive to the abiotic surface during aerobic granulation providing more contact sites for biomolecules and bacteria to favor the structure and stability of ags shi and liu 2021 qcm d analytic technology provides unprecedented insight into the underlying process of granulation with a particular focus on the eps surface interplay greatly deepening our theoretical understanding of this phenomenon but the potential effects of eps extracting process the surface adsorption and binding orientation should be considered during eps evaluation easley et al 2021 4 2 characterization of nrgs chemical properties eps has attracted prominent attention in the study of nrgs chemical properties fig 1 due to the fact that eps play a crucial role in accelerating the granulation of flocs as well as maintaining the integrity and stability of nrgs jia et al 2017 xia et al 2018 zhu et al 2012 for example eps bonding model is the most widely used model to explain the granulation process among several models selection pressure model inert nuclei model surface tension model adams et al 2022 however eps have been called the dark matter of biofilms given the large range of matrix biopolymers and the difficulty in analyzing them flemming et al 2007 therefore the application of advanced technologies are highly required in the study for eps of nrgs 4 2 1 assessment of the eps contents eps are biopolymers produced by microorganisms and accounted for over 90 of the dry mass of biofilms flemming and wingender 2010 eps contents could be roughly classified into five parts including proteins polysaccharides nucleic acids lipids and other biopolymers proteins and polysaccharides are the two fractions that received significantly more research interests the colorimetric method is the primary way to quantify the eps composition that owns superiorities in costs efficiency and excecution while the detection range is limited in contrast 3d eem can differentiate dissolved organic matter and ftir can detect the fundamental structure of eps components but they are favoured options of qualitative approaches rather than quantitative approaches the large amounts of data obtained by colorimetric method have revealed a consensus that the eps of nrgs has a much higher protein polysaccharide ratio than that of flocs guo et al 2017 zhu et al 2012 nevertheless the colorimetric method has some limitations such as a lack of standardized protocols making this method less precise and comparable also some specific compositions e g sialic acids cannot be detected and quantified due to its low response to certain colorimetric methods de graaff et al 2019 ras et al 2008 to overcome these limitations 3d eem can be used as a supplementary tool to extend the detection range 3d eem is characterized by a high sensitivity and selectivity and employed to qualitatively and semi quantitatively determine fluorescence compounds in organic dissolved matter aromatic protein like and tryptophan protein like substances are detected as key fractions to support the stability of nrgs wang et al 2021 zhu et al 2012 however its determination of fluorescent compounds is too ambiguous for molecular characterization ftir is a non destructive and real time analytical method it can qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the molecular composition of cell parts based on vibrations of the functional groups of different cell contents and has been widely used in microbiology research galichet et al 2001 sheng et al 2006 in nrgs related studies ftir is utilized to investigate the surface properties of nrgs or uncover the impact of environmental pollutants on the eps of nrgs for example the abundance of hydrophilic groups i e c oh c o and coo of carboxylate groups was detected by ftir and revealed that these hydrophilic groups were significantly lower in angs than in activated sludge favoring the granulation of flocs wang et al 2021 ftir also offered a remarkable insight into the protein secondary structure α helix β sheet random coil and β turn with data processing of the amide i region of ftir spectra at 1700 1600 cm 1 the ratio of α helix β helix random coil can be used to assess the protein structure and a lower ratio suggests a looser structure with more exposed hydrophobic groups facilitating the granulation hou et al 2015 as for uncovering the response of nrgs systems to environmental stress for instance changes in hydroxyl groups amides and polysaccharides were considered responsible for the decreased nre when ags was exposed to perfluorooctanoic acid yang et al 2020 the variations in specific functional groups displayed by ftir provides a deeper insight into the response of nrgs systems to stressful circumstances 4 2 2 the identification of specific constituents in eps the rough classification of eps components ignores the diversity in composition and structure which hinders our deep understanding of the accurate eps composition yu 2020 meanwhile identification of the key eps biopolymers in nrgs has always been a challenge due to the difficulty in non destructive eps extraction and its precise match with a poorly studied database boleij et al 2018 tan et al 2015 additionally these issues also require a high degree of molecular biological knowledge and skills despite these difficulties recent studies have tried to unravel the molecular constituents of eps from nrgs to help establish more efficient and sustainable wastewater treatment systems feng et al 2021 yu 2020 indeed relying on the combination of chromatography and other molecular characterization techniques table 2 fig 5 more eps components have been identified and characterized most of the current identified constituents are saccharide based polymers and they are all characterized to facilitate the stability of nrgs sialic acids are a group of monosaccharides that have been detected in eps from both ags and angs through staining and quantification boleij et al 2020 de graaff et al 2019 they maintain the stability of granule structure by supplying a net negative charge to bind calcium cations and masking the penultimate galactose residues to avoid the degradation of the sugar chain feng et al 2021 lin et al 2013 there are two components of exopolysaccharide that have been identified granulan has been successfully purified by fractional precipitation and preparatory scale gel permeation chromatography it is a gel forming exopolysaccharide which was deemed to form self assemble symmetric antiparallel helices to strengthen the stability of gels determined by molecular dynamics simulation techniques seviour et al 2010 seviour et al 2012 alginate like exopolysaccharides have been identified in ags by chemical spectroscopic and electrophoresis analysis and it contributes to the physical structure of ags with gel form lin et al 2010 glycosaminoglycans are linear heteropolysaccharides of eps which tend to be overlooked by commonly used colorimetric methods using ftir and staining the presence of glycosaminoglycans in ags and angs was confirmed they were presumed to function in attracting cations forming hydrogel binding proteins and signaling in biological processes boleij et al 2020 felz et al 2020b analyzed by mass spectrometry a highly abundant glycoprotein was identified in the eps of angs boleij et al 2018 according to previous research these glycoproteins were postulated to support the formation of a gel matrix for structural stability as well as form an efficient protective layer against degradation for the slow growing microorganisms vanklinken et al 1995 the current literature reflects the gaps in our knowledge regarding granular eps which requires imminent establishment of combined multidisciplinary characterization methods for their identification and functional assignment 4 3 the characterization of nrgs biological properties biological characterization is a critical aspect that directly determines the pollutants removal performance of nrgs systems with the rapid development of molecular biological techniques the understanding of complex microbial communities in nrgs has been remarkably deepend fish is an effective tool to visualize the spatial distribution of specific microorganisms especially for studying dense bio aggregates like nrgs but the specific matching between probes and microorganisms makes the harvest of information for the whole microbiome difficult the amplicon sequencing could allow taxonomic classification and quantification of the microbiome which has been accepted as a routine tool for studying microbial community to date however without the information of the whole genome the data cannot be accounted for the macroscopical phenomenons from genetic level the invention of meta omics has increased the knowledge of the microbiome of nrgs by establishing direct connections between the system performance and functional macromolecules the meta omics technology will become more prevalent with improved analytic efficiency and declining cost 4 3 1 fluorescence in situ hybridization fish fish was initially adopted to classify chromosomes and has been widely used in medical and biological research since its invention in 1986 pinkel et al 1986 in situ hybridization aims to detect the presence of dna or rna sequences of interest and locate their position with specific probes that match the sequence probes for fish are labeled by fluorescein biotin or digoxigenin and the signals from hybridization can be visualized by fluorescent microscopy jensen 2014 specific probes carry different colors of fluorescence so microorganisms will be colorfully stained and the spatial distribution of functional microorganisms can be observed under the view of clsm semi quantification of functional microbial fractions can be achieved meantime in a work that cultivated anaob and n damo microorganisms in a membrane granular sludge reactor fish clsm results showed that the granules formed a clear layered structure that anaob located in the outer layers of the granules while n damo microorganisms located inside the granules fig s4 fan et al 2020 on the basis of fish analysis the niche differentiation of the targeted functional microorganisms can be uncovered and the subsequent optimization strategy can be taken to regulate the microbial composition for performance improvement for instance in an ags reactor fish results showed that glycogen accumulating organisms a competitive organism against paos accumulated on the top of the sludge bed while paos were dominant at the bottom accordingly the sludge from the top of the sludge bed was discarded contributing to the enrichment of paos and complete phosphorus removal bassin et al 2012 4 3 2 the application of amplicon sequencing with years of development amplicon sequencing has been widely popular in detecting the overarching shifts in microbial communities because of its modest cost and broad applicability garner et al 2021 amplicon sequencing is commonly applied to the 16s rrna gene which is universal to both bacteria and archaea caporaso et al 2011 its utilization has permitted for the description of the microbial community with higher coverage and fidelity due to the difference in operational conditions ags tend to develop more complex and diverse microbiome than angs trego et al 2020 in a review summarizing the microbial composition of ags microorganisms such as rhodocyclaceae xanthomonadaceae comamonadaceae and rhodobacteraceae were frequently detected implying that ags contains a common core bacterial community xia et al 2018 for angs planctomycetes proteobacteria and chloroflexi are the major phyla cao et al 2016a qian et al 2018 besides the core member anaob affiliated to planctomycetes filamentous chloroflexi are crucial in angs and function as the backbone of the granular structure the identification of core microorganisms was obtained attributing to the large scale database supported by the extensive use of amplicon sequencing generally the abundance of microorganisms obtained by amplicon sequencing is connected with performance of nrgs systems especially the dominant species or the ones present significant changes furthermore microbial interactions the keystone community and even the assembly mechanism of nrgs could be analyzed with suitable ecological models based on abundant 16s rrna gene sequencing data deng et al 2012 sloan et al 2007 however the limitations of this method are also significant i the use of improper primers will miss a certain fraction of microorganisms and ii the sequencing coverage is not sufficient to garner genomic data of targeted microbiota eisenstein 2018 these limitations of amplicon sequencing technology impeded its application in obtaining a thorough understanding of the microbial communities responsible for nitrogen transformation in nrgs 4 3 3 the application of meta omics the meta omics approaches can identify microbial species metabolic pathways and metabolites associated with the nutrients conversion process in nrgs providing detailed information about the functional microbiome its application in nrgs has made progress in several aspects such as the illumination of mutually beneficial relationships mechanistic understanding of granulation and uncover the response of nrgs systems to environmental stress at the molecular level the cog category analysis based on metagenomics compared the functional gene discrepancy of candidatus kuenenia from three sludge samples flocs biofilm and granules candidatus kuenenia in the granules interacted intensively with coexisting populations due to possessing more genes for signal transduction and defence mechanisms meanwhile candidatus kuenenia in flocs and biofilm showed more diverse cellular metabolism thus the cog category analysis elucidates for the first time that different sludge morphologies where anaob inhabit could induce a discrepancy in gene expression of anaob guo et al 2016 moreover the application of integrated multi omics amplicon metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing clarified functional discrepancy among angs with varying sizes larger granules were found to harbour higher species and functional diversity with a better habitat differentiation and enhanced heterogeneity than smaller granules but such increase in the diversity was limited to a certain range of granule size because functional redundancy appears when granules grow over a threshold value chen et al 2020a with meta omics techniques numerous vital studies have unravelled the cross feeding of metabolites exchange in the granular anammox community fig 6 the metatranscriptomic analysis highlighted the prevalence and complexity of interspecies cross feeding in angs because the biosynthetic pathways of certain amino acids and vitamins such as tyrosine phenylalanine and b vitamins were not expressed in the majority of anammox consortia in a pn a granular system wang et al 2019a specifically the mutualistic relationships between anaob and other members need to be combed and reconstructed metabolic pathways based on metagenomics elucidated several potential cross feedings in this microcosmos anaob ca brocadia donated acetate b vitamins and eps amino acids peptides to other residents while several abundant hb e g chloroflexi and chlorobi were missing these genes ji et al 2021 lawson et al 2017 wang et al 2019a on the other hand anaob also need exogenous support e g anaob obtained secondary metabolites molybdopterin cofactor and folate and amino acids methionine tryptophan and shikimate from other members such as armatimonadetes and proteobacteria ji et al 2021 wang et al 2019a zhao et al 2018b by comparing the functional gene abundance of dominant microorganisms a wise strategy was noticed of the heterotrophic auxotrophic genotypes to survive in the organic carbon deficient environment in the anammox community i e they improve the transcribed membrane transportation process but abandon costly amino acids biosynthesis wang et al 2019a during the accelerated aggregation of anammox granules a synchronous increase in the fructose 6 phosphate and udp n acetyl d glucosamine was observed these two metabolites participate in the biosynthesis of exopolysaccharides assisted by metabolomics this work for the first time unmasked the dynamic changes of metabolites hidden behind the anammox granulation process guo et al 2017 furthermore seven amino acids phenylalanine leucine alanine threonine glycine glutamate and valine involved in extracellular protein synthesis were found to be positively correlated with its production during granulation p 0 003 zhao et al 2018a indeed metabolic profiling further confirmed the vital role of eps during granulation of anammox consortium by detecting key metabolites associated with eps production 4 4 data driven modeling mathematical modeling is a powerful tool to understand complex processes that cannot be directly obtained through experiments allowing for evaluating multiple operating conditions and scenarios for wastewater treatment since the establishment of activated sludge models mathematical modeling has been widely applied in the field from academic research to engineering application boltz et al 2010 morgenroth et al 2002 mathematical modeling has also been used to simulate nrgs operation table 3 for example a one dimensional granule model was developed with embeded metabolisms of n damo microbes and anaob in activated sludge model type kinetics this granule model successfully reproduces nitrogen dynamics and distribution of functional microorganisms under highly different operational conditions a strategy based on simulation involving a short hrt and small granules was proposed to optimize system performance peng et al 2021 moreover an integrated mathematical model was proposed to clarify the potential mechanism of cavitation and flotation of angs this model matched well with the actual floating behavior of granules and keeping granule size 2 5 mm was proposed to avoid granule flotation especially with high substrate concentration tan et al 2020 thus the complex biological processes dunring nrgs can be properly understood by mathematical models nevertheless the necessity of considering a group of differential equations for process kinetics and mass transfer which are bound by conditions greatly limits the generalization ability of those models to make predictions ni and yu 2010 artificial intelligence based models are more adaptive in modeling intricate processes because they can establish relationships among highly non linear data el din et al 2004 machine learning is a set of algorithms in artificial intelligence that capable of autonomous acquisition and integration of knowledge which has been gradually applied in environmental fields for effluent quality prediction pipe system rehabilitation prediction and flood disaster management islam et al 2021 seshan et al 2014 winkler et al 2018 the attempt in nrgs began by using various models such as adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system support vector regression and artificial neuron network in ags to achieve process simulation and performance prediction liang et al 2020 zaghloul et al 2018 2020 in recent studies an ensemble of machine learning was developed with a good fit to model ags reactors a five stage machine learning model was proposed which could predict the performance of ags and explain the reason for predicted failures zaghloul et al 2021 although these properties are artificially classified as physical chemical biological and systematic their inherent associations cannot be overlooked for nrgs biological properties functional microorganisms are the fundamental ones that determine the whole system because physical properties are the macroscopical phenomenon regulated by microorganisms and their products while chemical properties mostly focus on the microbial products eps and the systematic properties are obtained by integrating the abovementioned properties the network of nrgs properties and performance are presented in fig 7 the performance of nrgs is impacted by multiple properties thus the combined evaluation of various properties during nrgs research is frequent and effective which can provide insights from different perspectives for one issue complementing or corroborating with each other 5 conclusions and prospects this review provides an overview of nrgs technology with a focus on properties characterization the dense structure that accommodates integrated microbial nitrogen transformation pathways enables the promising performance of nrgs in wastewater treatment while its application is still limited in treating mainstream wastewater research on the characterization of nrgs properties could be of great importance in addressing the current issues physical properties of nrgs such as size strength and color have presented direct and strong correlations with nre which can be used to evaluate the real time status of nrgs systems chemical properties that mostly refer to eps fractions have been demonstrated to play a crucial role in the start up and stability of nrgs systems biological properties have unraveled the diversified interactions among microorganisms within the micro niche which is fundamental to the system systematic properties using modeling have gained progress in optimizing and predicting system performance meanwhile the corresponding characterization technologies are exhibited highlighting their indispensable role in making continuous progress in this area moreover the inherent associations among these properties cannot be overlooked for obtaining a thorough understanding of nrgs this review also reflects the necessity of multidisciplinary background for researchers for advanced research to promote the application of nrgs furher efforts are highly desired in the following areas 1 develop fine regulation strategies to enhance nitrogen removal performance despite the increasing establishment of connections between nrgs operational status and its properties effective regulation strategies and practical implementation remain nascent which is important to establish a harmonious balance among nre system stability and operational cost recent studies on fine regulation were mainly conducted via controlling operation parameters and optimizing reactor configurations with the booming development of synthetic biology the bioengineering modification of core microorganisms and the establishment of engineered nrgs systems are promising as fundamental resolutions 2 illustrate the migration and transformation of toxic pollutants the real wastewater containing toxic pollutants such as humic acids azo dyes and crude oil emulsions would negatively impact the performance of nrgs systems describing the migration and transformation of these toxic pollutants during biological treatment using novel techniques like nmr dna stable isotope probing will accelerate the establishment of detoxification approaches and directional cultivation of nrgs 3 further explore granule eps based applications currently the important role of eps in maintaining the stability of nrgs is preliminarily illuminated by the identification of several functional compositions future studies can focus on establishing standardized and integrated techniques for extracting and identifying eps constituents and developing remedial measures for disintegration from the perspective of eps meanwhile the development of in situ approaches are necessary to study the spatial heterogeneity of granule eps which is ignored by eps extraction additionally eps contains valuable recyclable resources from wastewater treatment and granular sludge yielded significantly more eps than floccular sludge therefore efforts on resource recovery from granule eps should be emphasized to achieve an effective energy loop reducing the energy input and realizing a net zero impact 4 enrich understanding of nrgs as a micro niche the spherical structure of nrgs represents a unique ecological model on a spatial scale with the development of spatial analysis such as spatially resolved transcriptomics that can harvest data of high dimensionality the bioprocesses inside nrgs can be displayed in a more vivid way and functional groups can be studied separately according to the spatial position this will shed light on the microbiome of nrgs from a new level of dimensionality in nrgs systems each particle is a small but an intricate ecological system the increasing use of community ecology will provide brand new insights into nrgs studies 5 establish an integrated monitoring system the discovery of various mechanisms accounting for the deterioration of nrgs systems reveals that a single parameter cannot precisely reflect the conditions of nrgs systems therefore an integrated monitoring system based on multi parameters evaluation is needed to detect real time working status and predict the

16191,although achieving good activated sludge settleability is a key requirement for meeting effluent quality criteria wastewater treatment plants often face undesired floc structure changes filamentous bulking has widely been studied however viscous sludge formation much less investigated so far our main goal was to find relationship between sludge floc structure and related rheological properties moreover to estimate pressure loss in pipe networks through hydrodynamic modelling of the non newtonian flows in case of well settling ideal like viscous and filamentous sludge severe viscous and filamentous kinds of bulking were generated separately in continuous flow lab scale systems initially seeded with the same reference ideal like biomass and the entire evolution of viscous and filamentous bulking was monitored the results suggested correlation between the rheological properties and the floc structure transformations and showed the most appropriate fit for the herschel bulkley model vs power law and bingham validated computational fluid dynamics studies estimated the pipe pressure loss in a wide reynolds number range for the initial well settling reference and the final viscous and filamentous sludge as well a practical standard modelling protocol was developed for improving energy efficiency of sludge pumping in different floc structure scenarios keywords

the most commonly applied treatment technology in municipal wastewater treatment worldwide unfavorable influent wastewater quality tardy et al 2012 inappropriate bioreactor arrangement and or operational conditions may lead to filamentous wanner and jobbágy 2014 or viscous bulking jobbágy et al 2017 kiss et al 2011 resulting in poor sludge settling while a number of domestic wastewater treatment plants wwtps face the overgrowth of filaments bakos et al 2019 especially in the winter period viscous bulking is the typical problem of wwtps receiving nutrient n and p deficient wastewater of the food industry e g winery or beverage industry wastewater etc jobbágy et al 2002 wanner and jobbágy 2014 both of the above mentioned undesired changes in floc structure might seriously affect the flow properties of the sludge thus monitoring rheological characteristics is of utmost importance structure and shape of sludge flocs highly depend on shear stress resulting in non newtonian flow behavior the change in particle size shape and volume fraction of solids as well as the nature of the liquid phase may largely affect the viscosity of the suspension consequently both filamentous and viscous bulking may cause drastic changes in rheological properties the main influencing factors of as rheological properties are the total suspended solids tss or mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration baudez 2008 seyssiecq et al 2008 temperature baroutian et al 2013 including the effect of thermal hydrolysis farno et al 2016 hii et al 2019 2017 ph and sludge age hong et al 2016 2018 seyssiecq et al 2003 while the source of the sample i e primary mixed excess biological or digested sludge the nature of the compounds present in solid and liquid compartments of as vachoud et al 2019 as well as the presence and type of conditioning agents may also have an effect hong et al 2018 wang et al 2017 since rheological properties of as strongly affect its biogas production capacity and dewatering ability numerous studies aim to understand the hydraulics of anaerobic digesters eshtiaghi et al 2012 and the compressibility in the solid liquid separation process as well stickland 2015 the relationship between as floc structure changes and rheological properties is still not fully understood wágner et al 2015 investigated rheological and settling parameters for quantifying and modelling filamentous bulking and reported that the impact of different filamentous species i e microthrix parvicella and chloroflexi on settling velocities can be remarkable additionally they found that abundance of microthrix parvicella can associate with hindered settling velocity and yield stress at high tss concentrations of 8 15 g m l s s l however to our knowledge the entire evolution processes of viscous and filamentous bulking have not been characterized by rheological measurements so far in this study our main goal was to find relationship between floc structure changes i e extracellular polymeric substances eps content and filamentous bacteria abundance and rheological properties i e dynamic viscosity consistency index flow behavior index during the evolution of viscous and filamentous bulking the most relevant rheological characteristics were identified not only dynamic viscosity but also consistency and flow behavior index were estimated to our knowledge this work implemented for the first time the simultaneous and integrated full biotechnological and rheological tracking of viscous and filamentous bulking changes in flow behavior may affect oxygen mass transfer as well as aeration and pumping related energy consumption and costs eshtiaghi et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 thus the hydrodynamic behavior was calculated by computational fluid dynamics cfd for estimating pressure losses in pipe networks as well as friction losses and loss coefficients of a defined pipe elbow configuration in case of a well settling reference ideal like and for viscous and filamentous floc structures using the most frequently applied non newtonian models baroutian et al 2013 baudez et al 2013 although numerous studies are available to describe the non newtonian flow field inside pipes and elbows cabral et al 2011 csizmadia and hos 2014 csizmadia and till 2018 khandelwal et al 2015 pinho and whitelaw 1990 additional originality of the paper resides in data

for each dried sample in magn 400x by an automatic microscope euromex iscope specifically modified and equipped for the measurement method the optical software transformed the pictures to the size of 640x480 pixels and scanned every box of 40x40 pixels according to a pre determined scanning plan optical investigations and evaluation were carried out by the box counting method according to the evaluated box count values each box of 40x40 pixels was classified as follows i fragmented and diffuse flocs ii very weak and filamentous iii weak flocs iv poorly compact flocs and v firm and compact

intra and extracellular carbohydrate concentrations of the as were determined according to the procedure developed by jobbágy et al 2002 the capillary suction time cst was measured for investigating sludge dewatering ability for the different biomass floc structure scenarios by cst equipment of triton electronics ltd dunmow uk 2 2 assessing the fit of rheological models the flow behaviour of the sludge was characterized by applying an anton paar physica mcr 301 rheometer equipped by double gap setup in rotation mode the internal and external gaps of double gap geometry were e 1 0 989 mm and e 2 1 136 mm respectively applying gap sizes min 10 times higher than the activated sludge floc diameters measured 80 100 µm for safely avoiding blockage of the flow during the rheological measurements mori et al 2006 ratkovich et al 2013 vachoud et al 2019 mlss concentration of the samples taken from the bioreactor was set carefully to 3 5 g l preceding rheological measurements by slight decantation or dilution with treated effluent the viscosity of as was measured for a shear rate range of 1 100 s 1 with three repetitions for each sample based on the literature recommendation baroutian et al 2013 baudez et al 2013 ratkovich et al 2013 1 the power law pl 2 the bingham b and 3 the herschel bulkley hb rheological models were fit to the measured data i e 1 τ k γ n 2 τ τ 0 b μ

rheograms i e 3 repetitions of shear stress shear rate curves for each sample on each sampling day both for viscous system and filamentous system these model fittings were performed through linear and nonlinear trust region reflective least squares algorithms in originpro 8 5 software 2 3 definition of losses and reynolds numbers to characterize the hydrodynamic behavior of the as suspension dimensionless parameters were introduced according to eq 4 and 5 the friction factor f was determined from the total pressure drop of a fully developed flow in a straight pipe section with a length of

the inner diameter of the pipe and v is the average flow velocity in case of laminar flow of b plastic fluids the friction factor was determined by the buckingham reiner equation see e g swamee and aggarwal 2011a for hb laminar flow an explicit equation for friction was applied according to swamee and aggarwal 2011b which is reynolds number and hedström number dependent the loss coefficient of an elbow ζ was defined as the non dimensional difference in total pressure caused by the fitting csizmadia and hos 2014 i e 5 ζ δ p e ρ 2 v 2 where δ p e denotes the total pressure drop which was calculated between the beginning of the elbow and the end of a subsequent plane section after this fitting in a distance of 9 d the loss caused by the wall friction in a straight pipe of the same length was subtracted but the forward disturbance of the fitting was taken into consideration according to the method developed and verified by csizmadia and till 2018 in principle the reynolds number as being the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces is given as r e v d ρ μ for newtonian fluids for laminar and fully developed flow for cylindrical pipes the darcy friction factor can be defined as f d 64 r e which is generally valid for fluids regardless to their rheological characteristics metzner and reed 1955 madlener et al 2009 introduced an extended version of the modified reynolds

τ 0 is the yield stress and μ is the dynamic viscosity furthermore m is the local gradient depending on v of the shear stress shear rate curve in a log log diagram madlener et al 2009 the necessity of modification in reynolds numbers as well as the consequent favorable effects on further data applicability and adaptability were demonstrated earlier by csizmadia and till 2018 under laminar flow conditions the darcy friction factor can be calculated from the modified reynolds number in case of non newtonian fluids i e f d 64 r e m o d csizmadia and till 2018 madlener et al 2009 monteiro and bansal 2010 moreover the use of r e m o d in the turbulent region is also valid csizmadia and till 2018 2 4 computational fluid dynamics simulation set up geometry meshing and numerics a typical geometry from the most commonly used size range in industrial applications was selected for the numerical simulations i e a pipe section with the diameter of d 0 1 m and an elbow with the radius of curvature of r d 1 liu and duan 2009 rötsch 1999 according to former cfd results and own validated laboratory measurements of csizmadia and hos 2014 and csizmadia and till 2018 the fully structured 3d numerical o grid type mesh generated in icem cfd fig 2 included 1 2 million cells in the boundary layer near the wall the resolution of the cells was properly configured following the calculations the y dimensionless wall distance values have been verified and apart from the inlet boundary it did not exceed the value of 1 supporting the appropriateness of the cfd model ansys 2011 at the inlet the fully developed turbulent velocity profile for newtonian fluids at the outlet the average static pressure were prescribed as boundary conditions csizmadia and till 2018 the pipe was modelled as a no slip hydraulically smooth wall steady state computations were performed with the commercial ansys cfx software ansys 2011 by solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes the continuity and the transport equations associated with the actual turbulence model filali et al 2013 singh et al 2010 white 1991 and high resolution spatial scheme was used for all equations the sst shear stress transport turbulence model was used which was tested previously for non newtonian flows csizmadia and hos 2014 csizmadia and till 2018 kfuri et al 2011 additional straight pipes with a length of 50 d on the upstream and another one with a length of 10 d on the downstream side were applied for allowing proper boundary conditions see fig 2 the length set for the upstream section has been proved to be appropriate in earlier studies csizmadia and till 2018 convergence was judged by monitoring the total pressure drop between the inlet and outlet boundaries the cfd calculations were carried out through all the three investigated rheological models i e pl b and hb on the basis of the rheological data measured during the experiment the rheological parameters calculated by model fitting for further application in cfd study are listed in table 3 in chapter 3 2 in order to compare the hydrodynamic behavior of the different sludge floc structures three specific states were chosen for the cfd simulations by applying rheological properties of as taken from the i seeding material of the lab scale systems on the starting day reference well settling sludge start ii viscous system viscous sludge end and iii filamentous system filamentous sludge end at the end of the experiment 3 results and discussion 3 1 biotechnological implementation and biochemical monitoring of activated sludge floc structure transformations lab scale experiments were first evaluated from biotechnological aspects the bioreactor temperature varied between 17 0 21 5 c according to laboratory room temperature do concentration was as high as 6 m g l at the start of the experiment in the intensively aerated bioreactor of viscous system but it decreased to 4 0 4 5 m g l after one week of operation although air diffusers were regularly cleaned intensive eps and biofilm formation led to do levels of 0 6 2 8 m g l in the last two weeks of the experiment bioreactor of filamentous system was intentionally underaerated in order to ensure low do environment accordingly the do level varied between 0 05 0 3 m g l during the whole experiment as expected from the operating conditions a massive overproduction of eps was observed in viscous system without increasing filament abundance while serious filamentous bulking was achieved in filamentous system without excessive eps formation see fig 3 thus sludge settleability decreased in both systems with dsvi finally increasing to almost 900 c m 3 g and 2300 c m 3 g for viscous and filamentous system respectively see fig 4 as shown in fig 4 viscous bulking caused a continuous increase in dsvi in viscous system from day 6 of operation until the end of the experiment in contrast the abundance of filaments did not change significantly in the first 2 weeks in filamentous system however a sharp increase in dsvi can be seen from days 13 14 due to the poor sludge settleability the secondary clarifiers were filled up with bulking sludge all along the experiment in both systems finally resulting in sludge overflow on day 30 see photos in fig 3 cod concentration peak values of 4050 m g c o d l and 323 m g c o d l were measured in viscous system and filamentous system respectively figure a 1 in appendix a supplementary information this led also to the undesired dilution of bioreactor mixed liquor in viscous system resulting in a decrease of mlss to 2 8 g l in the last week of the experiment mlss concentration was continuously decreasing in filamentous system due to the very low growth rate of microorganisms under the applied low s low do conditions and to the inevitable daily sampling of ca 0 5 l mixed liquor for analysis the initial eps content of 7 w w started to increase on day 10 17 w w and achieved 42 w w at the end of the experiment in viscous system in the case of filamentous system the filament abundance started to increase around days 13 14 reached a value of 60 within 5 days and finally 87 expressed in covered microscopic picture area at the end of the experiment see fig 4 c and d microscopical observations of native and stained sludge samples see fig 3 showed that the initial well settling reference sludge contained a low quantity of microthrix parvicella and few nostocoida limicola ii type 021n and type 0041 species the serious bulking was generated primarily through the overgrowth of nostocoida limicola ii coupled with nostocoida limicola i and iii species as well thiothrix and sphaerotilus natans followed by the presence of some microthrix parvicella type 021n and type 0041 as illustrated in fig 4 b and d the dsvi showed strong correlation with the eps content in viscous system and also with the filament abundance in filamentous system with spearman correlation coefficients of r s p s y s t e m 1 e p s c o n t e n t d s v i 1 and r s p s y s t e m 2 f i l a m e n t c o n t e n t d s v i 0 932 respectively these results for viscous system are in good concordance with the relationship between eps content and svi published by jobbágy et al 2002 at the start of the experiment after some days of adaptation the cod removal efficiency of viscous system exceeded 90 figure a 1 a in appendix a supplementary information then after one week effluent cod started to increase in a monotonic manner then this change accelerated and finally jumped to as high as 4000 m g l due to i deteriorated sludge settleability and ii limited oxygen and soluble substrate transfer caused by overproduction of eps cod removal decreased from 95 to approx 75 in filamentous system the cod removal efficiency was around 85 all along the experiment except for the final date figure a 1 b in appendix a supplementary information when sludge overflow occurred in both systems from the fully filled secondary clarifiers resulting in effluent cod and tss concentration peaks the capillary suction time cst of the initial reference ideal like sludge was low 6 7 s in the filamentous system cst remained almost constant varied in the range of 5 7 6 7 s during the whole experiment however viscous bulking led to high cst values reaching 250 s already on day 10 and increased continuously leading to an extremely poorly filterable sludge with a cst of 573 s on day 28 the high cst values were coherent with the poor sludge filterability all along the experiment in viscous system 3 2 results of rheological investigations and the parameter set measured the viscosity curves of both viscous and filamentous system measured at the end of the experiment as well as referring data of the initial reference sludge showed a pronounced shear thinning behavior as expected from semi concentrated sludge suspensions fig 5 we observed a striking difference between the rheological properties of the two systems at the end of the experiment the viscosity values of filamentous system changed to a smaller extent than in the case of the viscous sludge compared to the initial reference sludge which can be explained by the softness and higher deformability of the filaments seemingly unable to form a stiff network structure and consequently easy to be broken down by shear stress contrarily the viscous system exhibited large viscosity values even at high shear rates due to i the increase of the viscosity of the suspending liquid caused by eps ii the embedment of the as flocs in the gelled bulk medium the slope of the curves is similar apparently they seemingly differ by a constant multiplier only data points of the viscosity curves were fit to power law pl bingham b and herschel bulkley hb rheological models hb has been proved to be the most accurate indicated by the high coefficients of determination of the fit for both systems table 3 pl ignores the existence of yield stress which appears at the final stage of the viscous system while the b model does not describe the non linearity of the rheological behavior of the sludge resulting in a less accurate fit as compared to the hb model therefore the changes of rheological parameters over time are shown only for the hb model in fig 6 a c while those for pl and b models can be found in appendix a supplementary information figures a 2 3 both systems preserved their shear dependent behavior for the whole time range of the experiment fig 6 a also supported by pl as shown in figure a 2 remarkable changes in all of the hb fluid properties could be observed only after day 20 for viscous system fig 6 the least significant change was in the flow behavior index which was nearly constant during the experiment in both cases fig 6 a the hb dynamic viscosity and hb yield stress increased steadily and slowly during the study for filamentous system fig 6 b and c in the latter case the small increase of yield stress compared to viscous system indicated the absence of a stiff structure and the formation of only a very loose connection between solid parts confirmed also by yield stress calculated from the b model as shown in figure a 3 viscosity and flow properties have been proved to be dependent on sludge floc structure b and hb yield stresses b and hb dynamic viscosities showed a linear correlation with the indicators of biomass structures i e eps or filament content and with the dsvi table 4 fig 7 shows the relationship between the floc structure and the two parameters of the hb model for both systems it should be emphasized that the dynamic viscosity changed significantly in viscous system and filamentous system as well 3 3 results of computational fluid dynamics studies in industrial applications sludge is transported through pipelines and pipe fittings typically at a mean velocity of 0 5 2 m s ksb 2005 rötsch 1999 for the present fluids this represents turbulent flow conditions in the reynolds number range of r e m o d 2200 100000 although our calculations were performed for only one geometry results obtained for the friction and loss coefficients may be widely applicable due to the generalization of the reynolds number the predicted friction factors are presented as a function of the r e m o d fig 8 a diagram the average difference between our calculated friction factors and the f 64 r e m o d curve was 5 and similarly in the turbulent region as well fig 8b shows the dimensionless loss coefficient ζ of the elbow calculated for the three different biomass structures i e blue reference ideal like red viscous black filamentous with the three models applied i e pl h and hb for turbulent flows typical for full scale applications the coefficients calculated for the same biomass structure i e same colour seem to be arranged along straight lines in the log log scale diagram for appropriate sizing of hydraulic systems in wwtps the pressure drop caused by pipe elements has to be estimated at different flow velocities fig 9 in our work the pressure losses of the elbow were also determined for clean water commonly used as a reference in design practice on one hand in the highlighted flow velocity range of v 0 5 2 m s the pressure losses of the reference well settling sludge were 33 higher than those of the clean water on average considered for all flow velocities and models the highest increase in pressure drop was gained by the b fluid model for viscous sludge at v 0 5 m s compared to the clean water i e the value calculated for water increased by 170 see the small column chart in fig 9 this increase was 135 by hb model on the other hand as for comparing viscous and filamentous sludge to the initial reference ideal like sludge by hb model in the range of v 0 5 2 m s the pressure loss increased by 59 in the viscous system while this increase in the filamentous system was 22 on average the relative difference between the estimated pressure drops decreased with the increase of the mean velocity in the case of filamentous system the standard deviation of the pressure drop values calculated by the different rheological models was within 10 thus in this system the applied rheological model had no significant effect model selection becomes more important with the increase of viscosity and or the decrease of flow velocity 3 4 relationship between structural changes and hydrodynamic behavior based on the rheological fit and the hydrodynamic simulations the r e m o d dependent loss coefficients of the examined elbow could be estimated for the entire period of the experiment from start to end for this evaluation the hb model was applied in the r e m o d range of 5000 110000 the estimated relationship for the loss coefficient was ζ h b 4 9539 r e m o d 0 282 figure a 4 in appendix a supplementary information the calculated pressure drop on the elbow is shown in fig 10 at v 1 m s average flow velocity as a function of eps content and filamentous bacteria abundance in viscous system and filamentous system respectively the pressure losses on the elbow have been proved to be closely related to the changes of floc micro structure in the case of viscous bulking viscous system the correlation coefficient between the pressure drop and the eps content was r 0 81 in filamentous system an increase of the pressure drop could definitely be observed with the growing ratio of filaments however correlation coefficient showed a loose relationship r 0 68 4 outlook and perspectives the advanced standard protocol developed for modelling both viscous and filamentous bulking by rheological approach may serve as useful tool for improving energy efficiency of sludge pumping at municipal and or industrial as wwtps facing high energy consumption as well as seasonal or permanent sludge separability issues estimations calculated for pressure loss in pipe elements may be taken into consideration in state of the art design protocols of hydraulic systems i e sizing of pipes and fittings pump selection although calculations were carried out for an mlss concentration typically applied in conventional as bioreactors the new concept and the results may be applicable and adaptable in a wide range of the given dimensionless parameters e g for sludge flows in sludge treatment and dewatering processes 5 conclusions severe viscous and filamentous kinds of bulking were successfully generated under controlled experimental conditions in two separate continuous flow lab scale systems seeded with the same well settling ideal like reference sludge at the start results suggest correlation between dsvi and eps content in viscous system and similarly between dsvi and filamentous bacteria abundance in filamentous system both viscous and filamentous floc structures showed strongly non newtonian behavior during the whole experiment indicated by consistency index values significantly lower than 1 viscosity and yield stress values determined from rheological models showed distinct tendencies for the two systems although we obtained some correlation between the change of floc structure and rheological properties in both cases viscous bulking had a more pronounced effect on the flow behavior than filamentous bulking model discrimination showed that the herschel bulkley model has the best fit vs power law and bingham for describing flow properties of the investigated floc structures thus rheology has been proved to be a useful complementary tool for the quick identification of dominant bulking mechanism the cfd studies determined the effect of as floc structure changes on the friction factor the loss coefficient and the pressure drop of a typical pipe elbow configuration investigated the pressure loss was significantly higher in the case of non newtonian flows compared to the clean water and viscous bulking generated the largest pressure loss values the increase of the pressure losses calculated for viscous and filamentous biomass was also remarkable compared to the reference ideal like sludge a standard protocol has been developed for hydrodynamic modelling of both viscous and filamentous bulking which has been proved to be efficient for analyzing the energy consumption of nitrate recirculating and sludge recirculating pumps at wwtps and calculating pressure loss for different sludge floc structures to our knowledge this has been the first time when the entire evolution of both viscous and filamentous bulking was comprehensively analyzed and tracked by detailed biochemical and rheological measurements at a fixed biomass concentration 3 5 g l as well as combined by further hydrodynamic modelling research results provided a powerful tool for improving energy efficiency of

16191,although achieving good activated sludge settleability is a key requirement for meeting effluent quality criteria wastewater treatment plants often face undesired floc structure changes filamentous bulking has widely been studied however viscous sludge formation much less investigated so far our main goal was to find relationship between sludge floc structure and related rheological properties moreover to estimate pressure loss in pipe networks through hydrodynamic modelling of the non newtonian flows in case of well settling ideal like viscous and filamentous sludge severe viscous and filamentous kinds of bulking were generated separately in continuous flow lab scale systems initially seeded with the same reference ideal like biomass and the entire evolution of viscous and filamentous bulking was monitored the results suggested correlation between the rheological properties and the floc structure transformations and showed the most appropriate fit for the herschel bulkley model vs power law and bingham validated computational fluid dynamics studies estimated the pipe pressure loss in a wide reynolds number range for the initial well settling reference and the final viscous and filamentous sludge as well a practical standard modelling protocol was developed for improving energy efficiency of sludge pumping in different floc structure scenarios keywords

the most commonly applied treatment technology in municipal wastewater treatment worldwide unfavorable influent wastewater quality tardy et al 2012 inappropriate bioreactor arrangement and or operational conditions may lead to filamentous wanner and jobbágy 2014 or viscous bulking jobbágy et al 2017 kiss et al 2011 resulting in poor sludge settling while a number of domestic wastewater treatment plants wwtps face the overgrowth of filaments bakos et al 2019 especially in the winter period viscous bulking is the typical problem of wwtps receiving nutrient n and p deficient wastewater of the food industry e g winery or beverage industry wastewater etc jobbágy et al 2002 wanner and jobbágy 2014 both of the above mentioned undesired changes in floc structure might seriously affect the flow properties of the sludge thus monitoring rheological characteristics is of utmost importance structure and shape of sludge flocs highly depend on shear stress resulting in non newtonian flow behavior the change in particle size shape and volume fraction of solids as well as the nature of the liquid phase may largely affect the viscosity of the suspension consequently both filamentous and viscous bulking may cause drastic changes in rheological properties the main influencing factors of as rheological properties are the total suspended solids tss or mixed liquor suspended solids mlss concentration baudez 2008 seyssiecq et al 2008 temperature baroutian et al 2013 including the effect of thermal hydrolysis farno et al 2016 hii et al 2019 2017 ph and sludge age hong et al 2016 2018 seyssiecq et al 2003 while the source of the sample i e primary mixed excess biological or digested sludge the nature of the compounds present in solid and liquid compartments of as vachoud et al 2019 as well as the presence and type of conditioning agents may also have an effect hong et al 2018 wang et al 2017 since rheological properties of as strongly affect its biogas production capacity and dewatering ability numerous studies aim to understand the hydraulics of anaerobic digesters eshtiaghi et al 2012 and the compressibility in the solid liquid separation process as well stickland 2015 the relationship between as floc structure changes and rheological properties is still not fully understood wágner et al 2015 investigated rheological and settling parameters for quantifying and modelling filamentous bulking and reported that the impact of different filamentous species i e microthrix parvicella and chloroflexi on settling velocities can be remarkable additionally they found that abundance of microthrix parvicella can associate with hindered settling velocity and yield stress at high tss concentrations of 8 15 g m l s s l however to our knowledge the entire evolution processes of viscous and filamentous bulking have not been characterized by rheological measurements so far in this study our main goal was to find relationship between floc structure changes i e extracellular polymeric substances eps content and filamentous bacteria abundance and rheological properties i e dynamic viscosity consistency index flow behavior index during the evolution of viscous and filamentous bulking the most relevant rheological characteristics were identified not only dynamic viscosity but also consistency and flow behavior index were estimated to our knowledge this work implemented for the first time the simultaneous and integrated full biotechnological and rheological tracking of viscous and filamentous bulking changes in flow behavior may affect oxygen mass transfer as well as aeration and pumping related energy consumption and costs eshtiaghi et al 2013 zhang et al 2012 thus the hydrodynamic behavior was calculated by computational fluid dynamics cfd for estimating pressure losses in pipe networks as well as friction losses and loss coefficients of a defined pipe elbow configuration in case of a well settling reference ideal like and for viscous and filamentous floc structures using the most frequently applied non newtonian models baroutian et al 2013 baudez et al 2013 although numerous studies are available to describe the non newtonian flow

rheograms i e 3 repetitions of shear stress shear rate curves for each sample on each sampling day both for viscous system and filamentous system these model fittings were performed through linear and nonlinear trust region reflective least squares algorithms in originpro 8 5 software 2 3 definition of losses and reynolds numbers to characterize the hydrodynamic behavior of the as suspension dimensionless parameters were introduced according to eq 4 and 5 the friction factor f was determined from the total pressure drop of a fully developed flow in a straight pipe section with a length of

the inner diameter of the pipe and v is the average flow velocity in case of laminar flow of b plastic fluids the friction factor was determined by the buckingham reiner equation see e g swamee and aggarwal 2011a for hb laminar flow an explicit equation for friction was applied according to swamee and aggarwal 2011b which is reynolds number and hedström number dependent the loss coefficient of an elbow ζ was defined as the non dimensional difference in total pressure caused by the fitting csizmadia and hos 2014 i e 5 ζ δ p e ρ 2 v 2 where δ p e denotes the total pressure drop which was calculated between the beginning of the elbow and the end of a subsequent plane section after this fitting in a distance of 9 d the loss caused by the wall friction in a straight pipe of the same length was subtracted but the forward disturbance of the fitting was taken into consideration according to the method developed and verified by csizmadia and till 2018 in principle the reynolds number as being the ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces is given as r e v d ρ μ for newtonian fluids for laminar and fully developed flow for cylindrical pipes the darcy friction factor can be defined as f d 64 r e which is generally valid for fluids regardless to their rheological characteristics metzner and reed 1955 madlener et al 2009 introduced an extended version of the modified reynolds

modification in reynolds numbers as well as the consequent favorable effects on further data applicability and adaptability were demonstrated earlier by csizmadia and till 2018 under laminar flow conditions the darcy friction factor can be calculated from the modified reynolds number in case of non newtonian fluids i e f d 64 r e m o d csizmadia and till 2018 madlener et al 2009 monteiro and bansal 2010 moreover the use of r e m o d in the turbulent region is also valid csizmadia and till 2018 2 4 computational fluid dynamics simulation set up geometry meshing and numerics a typical geometry from the most commonly used size range in industrial applications was selected for the numerical simulations i e a pipe section with the diameter of d 0 1 m and an elbow with the radius of curvature of r d 1 liu and duan 2009 rötsch 1999 according to former cfd results and own validated laboratory measurements of csizmadia and hos 2014 and csizmadia and till 2018 the fully structured 3d numerical o grid type mesh generated in icem cfd fig 2 included 1 2 million cells in the boundary layer near the wall the resolution of the cells was properly configured following the calculations the y dimensionless wall distance values have been verified and apart from the inlet boundary it did not exceed the value of 1 supporting the appropriateness of the cfd model ansys 2011 at the inlet the fully developed turbulent velocity profile for newtonian fluids at the outlet the average static pressure were prescribed as boundary conditions csizmadia and till 2018 the pipe was modelled as a no slip hydraulically smooth wall steady state computations were performed with the commercial ansys cfx software ansys 2011 by solving the reynolds averaged navier stokes the continuity and the transport equations associated with the actual turbulence model filali et al 2013 singh et al 2010 white 1991 and high resolution spatial scheme was used for all equations the sst shear stress transport turbulence model was used which was tested previously for non newtonian flows csizmadia and hos 2014 csizmadia and till 2018 kfuri et al 2011 additional straight pipes with a length of 50 d on the upstream and another one with a length of 10 d on the downstream side were applied for allowing proper boundary conditions see fig 2 the length set for the upstream section has been proved to be appropriate in earlier studies csizmadia and till 2018 convergence was judged by monitoring the total pressure drop between the inlet and outlet boundaries the cfd calculations were carried out through all the three investigated rheological models i e pl b and hb on the basis of the rheological data measured during the experiment the rheological parameters calculated by model fitting for further application in cfd study are listed in table 3 in chapter 3 2 in order to compare the hydrodynamic behavior of the different sludge floc structures three specific states were chosen for the cfd simulations by applying rheological properties of as taken from the i seeding material of the lab scale systems on the starting day reference well settling sludge start ii viscous system viscous sludge end and iii filamentous system filamentous sludge end at the end of the experiment 3 results and discussion 3 1 biotechnological implementation and biochemical monitoring of activated sludge floc structure transformations lab scale experiments were first evaluated from biotechnological aspects the bioreactor temperature varied between 17 0 21 5 c according to laboratory room temperature do concentration was as high as 6 m g l at the start of the experiment in the intensively aerated bioreactor of viscous system but it decreased to 4 0 4 5 m g l after one week of operation although air diffusers were regularly cleaned intensive eps and biofilm formation led to do levels of 0 6 2 8 m g l in the last two weeks of the experiment bioreactor of filamentous system was intentionally underaerated in order to ensure low do environment accordingly the do level varied between 0 05 0 3 m g l during the whole experiment as expected from the operating conditions a massive overproduction of eps was observed in viscous system without increasing filament abundance while serious filamentous bulking was achieved in filamentous system without excessive eps formation see fig 3 thus sludge settleability decreased in both systems with dsvi finally increasing to almost 900 c m 3 g and 2300 c m 3 g for viscous and filamentous system respectively see fig 4 as shown in fig 4 viscous bulking caused a continuous increase in dsvi in viscous system from day 6 of operation until the end of the experiment in contrast the abundance of filaments did not change significantly in the first 2 weeks in filamentous system however a sharp increase in dsvi can be seen from days 13 14 due to the poor sludge settleability the secondary clarifiers were filled up with bulking sludge all along the experiment in both systems finally resulting in sludge overflow on day 30 see photos in fig 3 cod concentration peak values of 4050 m g c o d l and 323 m g c o d l were measured in viscous system and filamentous system respectively figure a 1 in appendix a supplementary information this led also to the undesired dilution of bioreactor mixed liquor in viscous system resulting in a decrease of mlss to 2 8 g l in the last week of the experiment mlss concentration was continuously decreasing in filamentous system due to the very low growth rate of microorganisms under the applied low s low do conditions and to the inevitable daily sampling of ca 0 5 l mixed liquor for analysis the initial eps content of 7 w w started to increase on day 10 17 w w and achieved 42 w w at the end of the experiment in viscous system in the case of filamentous system the filament abundance started to increase around days 13 14 reached a value of 60 within 5 days and finally 87 expressed in covered microscopic picture area at the end of the experiment see fig 4 c and d microscopical observations of native and stained sludge samples see fig 3 showed that the initial well settling reference sludge contained a low quantity of microthrix parvicella and few nostocoida limicola ii type 021n and type 0041 species the serious bulking was generated primarily through the overgrowth of nostocoida limicola ii coupled with nostocoida limicola i and iii species as well thiothrix and sphaerotilus natans followed by the presence of some microthrix parvicella type 021n and type 0041 as illustrated in fig 4 b and d the dsvi showed strong correlation with the eps content in viscous system and also with the filament abundance in filamentous system with spearman correlation coefficients of r s p s y s t e m 1 e p s c o n t e n t d s v i 1 and r s p s y s t e m 2 f i l a m e n t c o n t e n t d s v i 0 932 respectively these results for viscous system are in good concordance with the relationship between eps content and svi published by jobbágy et al 2002 at the start of the experiment after some days of adaptation the cod removal efficiency of viscous system exceeded 90 figure a 1 a in appendix a supplementary information then after one week effluent cod started to increase in a monotonic manner then this change accelerated and finally jumped to as high as 4000 m g l due to i deteriorated sludge settleability and ii limited oxygen and soluble substrate transfer caused by overproduction of eps cod removal decreased from 95 to approx 75 in filamentous system the cod removal efficiency was around 85 all along the experiment except for the final date figure a 1 b in appendix a supplementary information when sludge overflow occurred in both systems from the fully filled secondary clarifiers resulting in effluent cod and tss concentration peaks the capillary suction time cst of the initial reference ideal like sludge was low 6 7 s in the filamentous system cst remained almost constant varied in the range of 5 7 6 7 s during the whole experiment however viscous bulking led to high cst values reaching 250 s already on day 10 and increased continuously leading to an extremely poorly filterable sludge with a cst of 573 s on day 28 the high cst values were coherent with the poor sludge filterability all along the experiment in viscous system 3 2 results of rheological investigations and the parameter set measured the viscosity curves of both viscous and filamentous system measured at the end of the experiment as well as referring data of the initial reference sludge showed a pronounced shear thinning behavior as expected from semi concentrated sludge suspensions fig 5 we observed a striking difference between the rheological properties of the two systems at the end of the experiment the viscosity values of filamentous system changed to a smaller extent than in the case of the viscous sludge compared to the initial reference sludge which can be explained by the softness and higher deformability of the filaments seemingly unable to form a stiff network structure and consequently easy to be broken down by shear stress contrarily the viscous system exhibited large viscosity values even at high shear rates due to i the increase of the viscosity of the suspending liquid caused by eps ii the embedment of the as flocs in the gelled bulk medium the slope of the curves is similar apparently they seemingly differ by a constant multiplier only data points of the viscosity curves were fit to power law pl bingham b and herschel bulkley hb rheological models hb has been proved to be the most accurate indicated by the high coefficients of determination of the fit for both systems table 3 pl ignores the existence of yield stress which appears at the final stage of the viscous system while the b model does not describe the non linearity of the rheological behavior of the sludge resulting in a less accurate fit as compared to the hb model therefore the changes of rheological parameters over time are shown only for the hb model in fig 6 a c while those for pl and b models can be found in appendix a supplementary information figures a 2 3 both systems preserved their shear dependent behavior for the whole time range of the experiment fig 6 a also supported by pl as shown in figure a 2 remarkable changes in all of the hb fluid properties could be observed only after day 20 for viscous system fig 6 the least significant change was in the flow behavior index which was nearly constant during the experiment in both cases fig 6 a the hb dynamic viscosity and hb yield stress increased steadily and slowly during the study for filamentous system fig 6 b and c in the latter case the small increase of yield stress compared to viscous system indicated the absence of a stiff structure and the formation of only a very loose connection between solid parts confirmed also by yield stress calculated from the b model as shown in figure a 3 viscosity and flow properties have been proved to be dependent on sludge floc structure b and hb yield stresses b and hb dynamic viscosities showed a linear correlation with the indicators of biomass structures i e eps or filament content and with the dsvi table 4 fig 7 shows the relationship between the floc structure and the two parameters of the hb model for both systems it should be emphasized that the dynamic viscosity changed significantly in viscous system and filamentous system as well 3 3 results of computational fluid dynamics studies in industrial applications sludge is transported through pipelines and pipe fittings typically at a mean velocity of 0 5 2 m s ksb 2005 rötsch 1999 for the present fluids this represents turbulent flow conditions in the reynolds number range of r e m o d 2200 100000 although our calculations were performed for only one geometry results obtained for the friction and loss coefficients may be widely applicable due to the generalization of the reynolds number the predicted friction factors are presented as a function of the r e m o d fig 8 a diagram the average difference between our calculated friction factors and the f 64 r e m o d curve was 5 and similarly in the turbulent region as well fig 8b shows the dimensionless loss coefficient ζ of the elbow calculated for the three different biomass structures i e blue reference ideal like red viscous black filamentous with the three models applied i e pl h and hb for turbulent flows typical for full scale applications the coefficients calculated for the same biomass structure i e same colour seem to be arranged along straight lines in the log log scale diagram for appropriate sizing of hydraulic systems in wwtps the pressure drop caused by pipe elements has to be estimated at different flow velocities fig 9 in our work the pressure losses of the elbow were also determined for clean water commonly used as a reference in design practice on one hand in the highlighted flow velocity range of v 0 5 2 m s the pressure losses of the reference well settling sludge were 33 higher than those of the clean water on average considered for all flow velocities and models the highest increase in pressure drop was gained by the b fluid model for viscous sludge at v 0 5 m s compared to the clean water i e the value calculated for water increased by 170 see the small column chart in fig 9 this increase was 135 by hb model on the other hand as for comparing viscous and filamentous sludge to the initial reference ideal like sludge by hb model in the range of v 0 5 2 m s the pressure loss increased by 59 in the viscous system while this increase in the filamentous system was 22 on average the relative difference between the estimated pressure drops decreased with the increase of the mean velocity in the case of filamentous system the standard deviation of the pressure drop values calculated by the different rheological models was within 10 thus in this system the applied rheological model had no significant effect model selection becomes more important with the increase of viscosity and or the decrease of flow velocity 3 4 relationship between structural changes and hydrodynamic behavior based on the rheological fit and the hydrodynamic simulations the r e m o d dependent loss coefficients of the examined elbow could be estimated for the entire period of the experiment from start to end for this evaluation the hb model was applied in the r e m o d range of 5000 110000 the estimated relationship for the loss coefficient was ζ h b 4 9539 r e m o d 0 282 figure a 4 in appendix a supplementary information the calculated pressure drop on the elbow is shown in fig 10 at v 1 m s average flow velocity as a function of eps content and filamentous bacteria abundance in viscous system and filamentous system respectively the pressure losses on the elbow have been proved to be closely related to the changes of floc micro structure in the case of viscous bulking viscous system the correlation coefficient between the pressure drop and the eps content was r 0 81 in filamentous system an increase of the pressure drop could definitely be observed with the growing ratio of filaments however correlation coefficient showed a loose relationship r 0 68 4 outlook and perspectives the advanced standard protocol developed for modelling both viscous and filamentous bulking by rheological approach may serve as useful tool for improving energy efficiency of sludge pumping at municipal and or industrial as wwtps facing high energy consumption as well as seasonal or permanent sludge separability issues estimations calculated for pressure loss in pipe elements may be taken into consideration in state of the art design protocols of hydraulic systems i e sizing of pipes and fittings pump selection although calculations were carried out for an mlss concentration typically applied in conventional as bioreactors the new concept and the results may be applicable and adaptable in a wide range of the given dimensionless parameters e g for sludge flows in sludge treatment and dewatering processes 5 conclusions severe viscous and filamentous kinds of bulking were successfully generated under controlled experimental conditions in two separate continuous flow lab scale systems seeded with the same well settling ideal like reference sludge at the start results suggest correlation between dsvi and eps content in viscous system and similarly between dsvi and filamentous bacteria abundance in filamentous system both viscous and filamentous floc structures showed strongly non newtonian behavior during the whole experiment indicated by consistency index values significantly lower than 1 viscosity and yield stress values determined from rheological models showed distinct tendencies for the two systems although we obtained some correlation between the change of floc structure and rheological properties in both cases viscous bulking had a more pronounced effect on the flow behavior than filamentous bulking model discrimination showed that the herschel bulkley model has the best fit vs power law and bingham for describing flow properties of the investigated floc structures thus rheology has been proved to be a useful complementary tool for the quick identification of dominant bulking mechanism the cfd studies determined the effect of as floc structure changes on the friction factor the loss coefficient and the pressure drop of a typical pipe elbow configuration investigated the pressure loss was significantly higher in the case of non newtonian flows compared to the clean water and viscous bulking generated the largest pressure loss values the increase of the pressure losses calculated for viscous and filamentous biomass was also remarkable compared to the reference ideal like sludge a standard protocol has been developed for hydrodynamic modelling of both viscous and filamentous bulking which has been proved to be efficient for analyzing the energy consumption of nitrate recirculating and sludge recirculating pumps at wwtps and calculating pressure loss for different sludge floc structures to our knowledge this has been the first time when the entire evolution of both viscous and filamentous bulking was comprehensively analyzed and tracked by detailed biochemical and rheological measurements at a fixed biomass concentration 3 5 g l as well as combined by further hydrodynamic modelling research results provided a powerful tool for improving energy efficiency of

mww and md are discharged in close proximity into the same stream while the separate impacts of these waste streams on receiving water bodies have been documented in countless studies the dynamic interaction and underlying mechanisms of these two pollution sources within the same body of water has been relatively unstudied in this work we hypothesize that if mww and md mix in stream downstream water quality degradation by nutrients and metals may be mitigated via in stream physicochemical interactions between the two pollutants during predominantly baseflow conditions this hypothesis was tested in a small stream in central pennsylvania that receives md and treated mww at the same location thus acting as a simple model system the study contributes to a broader understanding of ongoing

quality the md and mww discharges had noticeably different water quality characteristics each with potentially different impacts on downstream quality the md samples had ph 4 5 to 5 1 with elevated metals concentrations al 1 54 to 4 96 mg l fe 0 14 to 0 88 mg l mn 0 46 to 0 62 mg l and relatively low nutrient concentrations po4 0 28 to 0 89 mg l no3 0 91 to 1 53 mg l compared to mww samples the mww chemistry was generally similar to typical effluent quality metcalf and eddy et al 2013 with circumneutral ph low metals and high nutrient concentrations on most dates fig 2 combined with high doc 3 8 to 8 2 mg l md frequently contributed the largest fraction of streamflow after mixing often 50 75 while mww and us each generally composed 10 30 of the total streamflow fig 3 although bradley run

circumneutral levels measured upstream of md influence fig 2a increased ph with distance downstream from md discharges commonly results from the outgassing of dissolved co2 which tends to be elevated in md at the point of discharge cravotta 2008 2015 cravotta et al 2014 doc concentrations after mixing were generally low 1 3 mg l average due to minimal contributions from us and md the organics were rapidly removed along the flow path with 88 of doc removed upon reaching ds90 on average and many samples at ds90 and ds950 having doc below detection 0 1 mg l organics were likely removed by coagulation mechanisms such as sweep flocculation as previously demonstrated when co treating md and mww ruihua et al 2011 spellman et al 2020 strosnider et al 2013 dissolved al and fe concentrations in the stream were less than expected for conservative mixtures fig 2 with al predominating at all sites see fig si 2 streamflow did not increase from the mixing zone to the downstream sites indicating that changes in concentrations of metals and nutrients resulted from reactions not from dilution the downstream sites had average concentrations of dissolved al less than 1 mg l below the expected average of 1 7 mg l for conservative mixing fig 2b the average al concentrations at ds90 were greater than those at ds950 and ds1400 whereas concentrations of al at the two downstream sites were not significantly different one way anova f 128 df 5 p 0 001 than those at us and were always below the acute aquatic toxicity threshold of 0 75 mg l gensemer and playle 1999 which corresponds to the in stream limit for the total maximum daily loads in pennsylvania pennsylvania department of environmental protection 2007 furthermore dissolved al concentrations at ds1400 were less than those reported 0 3 0 5 mg l to negatively impact benthic communities burton and allan 1986 herrmann 2001 potential impacts to fish health are of greater concern however due to the respiratory ionoregulation and cardiovascular toxicity posed by relatively low al concentrations wilson 2011 although less of an aquatic health concern than al dissolved fe concentrations after mixing were always less than the 1 0 mg l criterion continuous concentration on average u s environmental protection agency 1986 the two most downstream sites exhibited substantial fe removal compared to that at ds90 within the mixing zone with ds1400 fe concentrations the same as the us location one way anova the al and fe removed from the water column accumulated as conspicuous white and orange colored precipitate on the streambed near the point of md discharge to the stream fig si 1 and graphical abstract although acute toxicity from dissolved metals was mitigated al oh 3 and fe oh 3 precipitate formed in an md mixing zone may actually pose higher acute toxicities to fish than initial dissolved al and fe concentrations because the precipitate may clog gills resulting in suffocation henry et al 1999 2001 teien et al 2006 long term accumulation of such precipitate into stream sediments may also impact the benthic community kotalik et al 2019 and aquatic plant diversity by shifting abundance to metal tolerant species bakker et al 2016 a primary concern for any mww discharge is the introduction of nutrients into freshwater streams bradley run is part of the susquehanna river basin which is responsible for 42 of the nutrients entering the chesapeake bay ator 2019 the no3 introduced to bradley run by the mww 79 5 mg l average had a notable impact on water quality after mixing elevating the downstream concentrations by an order of magnitude fig 2d although median no3 concentrations at the three downstream sites appear to trend downward fig 2d there was no significant change in the downstream averages one way anova as above f 202 9 df 5 p 0 001 suggesting there was little in stream removal estimated n removal rates in the studied reach i e ds1400 varied from 230 mg n m2d to 3000 mg n m2d which are considered normal rates for natural waterways which can have rates as low as 100 mg n m2d to as high as 5300 mg n m2d assuming denitrification as the primary removal mechanism laursen and seitzinger 2002 bott et al 2012 reported in stream no3 removal rates may be diminished because of limited availability of po4 attenuated by interactions with md metals which may also be the case for bradley run in contrast with no3 downstream attenuation of po4 concentrations was substantial fig 2e even though mww had notably elevated po4 12 3 mg l compared to upstream 0 28 mg l po4 concentrations at all downstream sampling sites were not significantly different than the us site one way anova as above f 258 1 df 5 p 0 001 with concentrations often approaching the limit of detection 0 08 mg l p p removal rates at ds90 were estimated between 2100 and 5500 mg p m2d orders of magnitude faster than p removal by typical in stream attenuation 10 250 mg p m2d ready et al 1999 svendsen and kronvang 1993 or in engineered treatment wetlands 100 400 mg p m2d bojcevska and tonderski 2007 braskerud 2002 the p concentrations via dilution resulting from conservatively mixing the three sources would have averaged 0 78 mg l as p classifying the stream well above the levels typically considered as eutrophic 0 08 mg l as p dodds et al 1998 gurung et al 2013 however the average po4 concentration at ds90 were often below detection indicating rapid in stream attenuation of po4 and improvement of the stream s trophic status to mesotrophic 0 03 0 08 mg l p with regards to p dodds et al 1998 gurung et al 2013 although the resultant n concentrations would still classify as eutrophic 1 5 mg l as n dodds et al 1998 it is important to note that p was likely the limiting nutrient for bradley run upstream of the mww discharge typical for freshwater systems clune et al 2020 dodds and smith 2016 hecky and kilham 1988 downstream of the discharge limited concentrations of p would be of even greater importance concerning algal production because of the highly elevated n concentrations contributed by the mww and not attenuated by mixing with md for example drerup and vis 2017 observed diminished biofilm productivity in md impaired and remediated streams owing to the limited availability of po4 3 2 factors affecting co attenuation of nutrients and metals results from this study indicate in stream physicochemical mechanisms result in a relatively high removal 90 of po4 al and fe while having smaller influence on no3 fig 4 a al removal was highly dependent r2 0 82 on stream ph fig 4b the highest removal occurred when the ph at ds90 exceeded 6 0 where al was always removed at 80 while removal varied between 65 and 90 when ds90 ph was 5 5 6 0 the inverse relation between ph and metals concentrations is consistent with precipitation of al oh 3 and fe oh 3 computations with phreeqc indicated saturation indices for gibbsite were greater than 0 supersaturated while those for amorphous al oh 3 were less than 0 undersaturated for all but a few samples whereas those for al oh 3 having solubility intermediate to gibbsite and amorphous al oh 3 ranged from 0 to 1 for two thirds of the samples implying equilibrium fig si 5 thus al oh 3 of intermediate solubility could feasibly control observed al concentrations in contrast more than 90 percent of samples having ph 7 were supersaturated with basaluminite al oh 2 5 so4 0 25 or hydrobasaluminite fig si 5 indicating kinetic barriers to precipitation of these al hydroxysulfate phases less pronounced decreases in fe concentrations were observed between the ph at ds90 and fe removal see fig si 4 this observation is consistent with partial oxidation of fe prior to and immediately after mixing and thus limited potential for precipitation of fe oh 3 slow oxidation kinetics of fe particularly at ph 6 are well documented e g stumm and morgan 1996 cravotta 2015 samples in the mixing zone ds90 site had a median ph of 5 4 however substantial fe removal was observed by ds950 which had ph ranging from 7 3 to 8 1 fig 2a assuming the oxidation state of fe in samples may be computed from do on the basis of the redox relation of sato 1960 saturation indices for goethite were always greater than 0 whereas those for amorphous fe oh 3 were less than 0 for 75 of the samples however all but two samples with ph 7 had saturation index 0 for amorphous fe oh 3 the removal rates for both dissolved al and fe are presented in fig 4c pseudo first order removal of both fe and al was 0 33 and 0 30 hr 1 respectively removals observed in this study are similar to fe rates 0 2 to 0 6 hr 1 previously quantified for streams impacted by md cravotta 2015 although the metals from md would slowly be removed via natural processes i e absent of mww over very long distances the co attenuation from addition of mww likely increased formation of precipitates upon mixing which attenuated dissolved metals leading to measurable water quality improvements within the study area the data in this study demonstrate strong langmuir isotherm behavior fig 4d supporting adsorption of po4 as a possible removal mechanism with a theoretical system maximum adsorption capacity qm of 0 43 mg p per mg metal this is in agreement with prior work interpreting po4 adsorption as a contributing removal mechanism in other md mww systems hughes and gray 2013 smyntek et al 2022 spellman et al 2020 wei et al 2008 the phreeqc modeling and related computations included in supplemental information and cravotta 2021a indicate in stream co attenuation mechanisms responsible for relatively high 90 po4 removal were likely adsorption onto fe oh 3 and al oh 3 particles and coatings on stream sediments e g pérez et al 2014 coupled with precipitation of crystalline to amorphous al po4 compounds e g variscite roncal herrero et al 2009 roncal herrero and oelkers 2011 saturation indices for variscite were 0 for more than 50 of the samples and were inversely correlated with ph fig si 5 indicating low ph samples had greater potential to precipitate alpo4 compounds than high ph samples an inverse correlation between the activity of al3 aal3 and activity of po4 3 apo4 3 fig 5 a and a positive correlation between apo4 3 and ph fig 5b are consistent with p solubility control by variscite or amorphous alpo4 particularly for samples having ph 7 0 as described earlier for al decreased aal 3 with increased ph is consistent with precipitation of al oh 3 having solubility intermediate between amorphous al oh 3 and crystalline gibbsite precipitation of al oh 3 is likely to be rapid seconds to minutes compared to alpo4 2h2o minutes to hours e g roncal herrero and oelkers 2011 and thus al oh 3 formation is likely to limit aqueous al concentrations fig 5b which assumes aal3 at equilibrium with al oh 3 shows most samples having ph 7 0 also have a po4 3 consistent with solubility delineated for variscite si 0 relative to equilibrium constant of mcbride 1994 to amorphous alpo4 variscite si 2 0 however for most of the ph 7 0 samples apo4 3 is less than variscite equilibrium values adsorption of po4 by al oh 3 and or fe oh 3 could maintain apo4 3 at those observed low levels for the high ph samples thus decreasing potential for variscite precipitation results of the phreeq n titration po4 adsorption simulations shown fig 6 indicate combined effects of adsorption and precipitation on po4 concentrations the models mix the us mww and md samples in proportions estimated for sample dates assuming all have initial ph of 2 and then subject the mixture to ph adjustment at 0 25 unit intervals instantaneous equilibrium precipitation and adsorption reactions occur in response to the ph increases for comparison one simulation mixes only us and mww samples without md and associated dissolved and precipitated metals this simulation does not explain the observed po4 data the models that simulate proportional mixing of us mww and md demonstrate that 1 efficient removal of po4 at ph 5 to 7 fig 6a may be explained by the precipitation of crystalline to amorphous alpo4 2h2o with solubilities considered by mcbride 1994 and stumm and morgan 1996 whereas 2 relatively inefficient removal of po4 at ph 5 or 7 fig 6b may be explained by the precipitation of highly soluble amorphous alpo4 and or adsorption to hydrous metal oxide hmeo containing predominantly al oh 3 with minor but important fe oh 3 explained below to simulate p precipitation for a range of potential saturation states the variscite solubility constant of mcbride 1994 is used as the reference state si 0 shown as black dotted curve in fig 6 to simulate precipitation of amorphous alpo4 saturation index values greater than 0 were specified at which solids would form for example the solubility constant of stumm and morgan 1996 which is 1 log unit greater than that of mcbride 1994 is equivalent to si 1 0 resulting in greater dissolved po4 at equilibrium with that higher solubility phase highly soluble amorphous alpo4 consistent with reporting by roncal herrero and oelkers 2011 was simulated by specifying si 2 0 to 2 5 as the equilibrium condition at which alpo4 precipitation could occur resulting in inefficient removal of po4 by precipitation the model results indicate that for cases where po4 attenuation is poor corresponding to ph 5 fig 6b adsorption could have a similar effect on po4 attenuation as precipitation of more soluble amorphous alpo4 for the model results shown in fig 6 previously accumulated hmeo is specified as having a constant mass 0 25 or 50 mg l with composition estimated as the percentage of al fe and mn any al oh 3 fe oh 3 or mnooh precipitated from solution is added to previously accumulated hmeo model results for 0hmeo specified hmeo mass 0 simulate conditions where sorption depends solely on fresh precipitate from dissolved al fe and mn in addition to the fresh precipitate other simulations include 25 or 50 mg l hmeo consisting of 98 al and 2 fe that relatively small mass of existing hmeo containing a small fraction of fe was adequate to simulate observations despite the relative abundance of accumulated al oh 3 po4 adsorption for this particular system is indicated to result mainly from the small amount of accumulated fe oh 3 which has greater affinity for po4 than an equal amount of al oh 3 increasing the mass of hmeo sorbent or the fraction of fe in the sorbent resulted in increased removal of po4 and also so4 which behaves conservatively and was not consistent with observations 3 3 implications of co attenuation the near complete removal of po4 from the downstream water in bradley run may be representative of other streams in the appalachian region and thus noteworthy in the context of the u s environmental protection agency s 2010 tmdl calling for a 24 reduction in total p loads entering the chesapeake bay watershed through the implementation of nutrient management practices considering the abundance of md and mww discharges in proximity to each other in the study area e g fig 1 and in other coal mined areas p removal via in stream interactions with md discharges may play an important role in decreasing overall nutrient loadings into major downstream water bodies based on the gallitzin mwwtp reported monthly average po4 discharges table si 2 the in stream co attenuation at bradley run alone could potentially remove between 810 and 950 kg yr of total p from the susquehanna river watershed this p is likely present as al fe po4 compounds and bound to hmeo deposited in bradley run because of sequestration of soluble p with sediment aquatic productivity may be diminished in amd impaired systems even after partial remediation bott et al 2012 drerup and vis 2017 nevertheless the p associated with such sediment could be transported downstream during high flow events or desorbed dissolved from those sediments in response to changing water chemistry extensive remediation and natural attenuation of md with consequent increases in ph and decreases in dissolved metals concentrations e g burrows et al 2015 younger et al 2002 may reduce the potential for precipitation of al fe po4 compounds and adsorption of po4 by hmeo unless water resource managers address pollutant reductions from p sources e g untreated or poorly treated mww discharges agricultural suburban urban runoff etc in conjunction with md remediation increased dissolved p availability and transport to downstream aquatic ecosystems will result 4 conclusions in stream interactions of po4 with al and fe resulted in 91 decrease in po4 concentrations compared to conservative mixing while no3 decreased by 20 al and fe were removed 90 from the water column as al oh 3 and fe oh 3 fe was removed at a faster rate than al inverse correlation between activities of po4 3 and al3 and corresponding saturation indices for crystalline to amorphous alpo4 2h2o i e variscite indicate equilibrium conditions for samples with ph 5 to 7 and potential co precipitation of al and po4 although precipitation of alpo4 2h2o could explain efficient removal of po4 such precipitation appeared to be inhibited or limited to formation of a high solubility amorphous phase when inefficient removal of p was observed adsorption of po4 was indicated as the predominant mechanism for po4 removal at ph 5 or 7 and likely to occur with alpo4 2h2o precipitation at ph 5 to 7 despite its relative abundance adsorption of po4 by al oh 3 was indicated as subordinate to adsorption by minor amounts of fe oh 3 in the mixed precipitate within the stream the results presented in this study suggest in stream dynamic interactions between mww and md lead to co attenuation of pollutants resulting in improved downstream trophic status and other water quality characteristics such as ph and metals concentrations in stream interactions between md and mww may play an important but under studied role in decreasing nutrient i e p and metal loadings to natural waterways via co attenuation in historic mining regions e g appalachia central andes xinjiang etc although results demonstrate co attenuation can improve downstream water quality co attenuation should not serve as the only option for abating these discharges due to the related uncontrolled deposition of metal oxyhydroxide solids and potential toxic effects to aquatic organisms resulting from gill clogging by precipitating solids additional study of the physical characteristics composition mineralogy and stability of metal rich precipitate formed by interaction of md and mww in the mixing zone would be beneficial to

of surface adsorption and precipitation perez et al 2014 the objective of this work was to identify and quantify the primary mechanisms that account for co attenuation of nutrients and metals after mww and md are discharged in close proximity into the same stream while the separate impacts of these waste streams on receiving water bodies have been documented in countless studies the dynamic interaction and underlying mechanisms of these two pollution sources within the same body of water has been relatively unstudied in this work we hypothesize that if mww and md mix in stream downstream water quality degradation by nutrients and metals may be mitigated via in stream physicochemical interactions between the two pollutants during predominantly baseflow conditions this hypothesis was tested in a small stream in central pennsylvania that receives md and treated mww at the same location thus acting as a simple model system the study contributes to a broader understanding of ongoing

information additionally the phreeq n titration po4 adsorption aqueous and surface speciation model cravotta 2021a was applied to investigate the relative importance of mineral precipitation and or adsorption for attenuating po4 and associated dissolved constituents mineral solubility adsorption equilibrium constants and surface properties employed in that model are explained in cravotta 2021b 2021a separately langmuir isotherm behavior of in situ po4 adsorption on metal hydroxides was calculated in a similar manner to yang et al 2006 3 results discussion 3 1 in stream mixing and downstream quality the md and mww discharges had noticeably different water quality characteristics each with potentially different impacts on downstream quality the md samples had ph 4 5 to 5 1 with elevated metals concentrations al 1 54 to 4 96 mg l fe 0 14 to 0 88 mg l mn 0 46 to 0 62 mg l and relatively low nutrient concentrations po4 0 28 to 0 89 mg l no3 0 91 to 1 53 mg l compared to mww samples the mww chemistry was generally similar to typical effluent quality metcalf and eddy et al 2013 with circumneutral ph low metals and high nutrient concentrations on most dates fig 2 combined with high doc 3 8 to 8 2 mg l md frequently contributed the largest fraction of streamflow after mixing often 50 75 while mww and us each generally composed 10 30 of the total streamflow fig 3 although bradley run was strongly influenced by the low ph md immediately after mixing site ds90 the stream ph significantly recovered one way anova tukey s family error rate f 199 4 df 5 p 0 001 by ds950 to the circumneutral levels measured upstream of md influence fig 2a increased ph with distance downstream from md discharges commonly results from the outgassing of dissolved co2 which tends to be elevated in md at the point of discharge cravotta 2008 2015 cravotta et al 2014 doc concentrations after mixing were generally low 1 3 mg l average due to minimal contributions from us and md the organics were rapidly removed along the flow path with 88 of doc removed upon reaching ds90 on average and many samples at ds90 and ds950 having doc below detection 0 1 mg l organics were likely removed by coagulation mechanisms such as sweep flocculation as previously demonstrated when co treating md and mww ruihua et al 2011 spellman et al 2020 strosnider et al 2013 dissolved al and fe concentrations in the stream were less than expected for conservative mixtures fig 2 with al predominating at all sites see fig si 2 streamflow did not increase from the mixing zone to the downstream sites indicating that changes in concentrations of metals and nutrients resulted from reactions not from dilution the downstream sites had average concentrations of dissolved al less than 1 mg l below the expected average of 1 7 mg l for conservative mixing fig 2b the average al concentrations at ds90 were greater than those at ds950 and ds1400 whereas concentrations of al at the two downstream sites were not significantly different one way anova f 128 df 5 p 0 001 than those at us and were always below the acute aquatic toxicity threshold of 0 75 mg l gensemer and playle 1999 which corresponds to the in stream limit for the total maximum daily loads in pennsylvania pennsylvania department of environmental protection 2007 furthermore dissolved al concentrations at ds1400 were less than those reported 0 3 0 5 mg l to negatively impact benthic communities burton and allan 1986 herrmann 2001 potential impacts to fish health are of greater concern however due to the respiratory ionoregulation and cardiovascular toxicity posed by relatively low al concentrations wilson 2011 although less of an aquatic health concern than al dissolved fe concentrations after mixing were always less than the 1 0 mg l criterion continuous concentration on average u s environmental protection agency 1986 the two most downstream sites exhibited substantial fe removal compared to that at ds90 within the mixing zone with ds1400 fe concentrations the same as the us location one way anova the al and fe removed from the water column accumulated as conspicuous white and orange colored precipitate on the streambed near the point of md discharge to the stream fig si 1 and graphical abstract although acute toxicity from dissolved metals was mitigated al oh 3 and fe oh 3 precipitate formed in an md mixing zone may actually pose higher acute toxicities to fish than initial dissolved al and fe concentrations because the precipitate may clog gills resulting in suffocation henry et al 1999 2001 teien et al 2006 long term accumulation of such precipitate into stream sediments may also impact the benthic community kotalik et al 2019 and aquatic plant diversity by shifting abundance to metal tolerant species bakker et al 2016 a primary concern for any mww discharge is the introduction of nutrients into freshwater streams bradley run is part of the susquehanna river basin which is responsible for 42 of the nutrients entering the chesapeake bay ator 2019 the no3 introduced to bradley run by the mww 79 5 mg l average had a notable impact on water quality after mixing elevating the downstream concentrations by an order of magnitude fig 2d although median no3 concentrations at the three downstream sites appear to trend downward fig 2d there was no significant change in the downstream averages one way anova as above f 202 9 df 5 p 0 001 suggesting there was little in stream removal estimated n removal rates in the studied reach i e ds1400 varied from 230 mg n m2d to 3000 mg n m2d which are considered normal rates for natural waterways which can have rates as low as 100 mg n m2d to as high as 5300 mg n m2d assuming denitrification as the primary removal mechanism laursen and seitzinger 2002 bott et al 2012 reported in stream no3 removal rates may be diminished because of limited availability of po4 attenuated by interactions with md metals which may also be the case for bradley run in contrast with no3 downstream attenuation of po4 concentrations was substantial fig 2e even though mww had notably elevated po4 12 3 mg l compared to upstream 0 28 mg l po4 concentrations at all downstream sampling sites were not significantly different than the us site one way anova as above f 258 1 df 5 p 0 001 with concentrations often approaching the limit of detection 0 08 mg l p p removal rates at ds90 were estimated between 2100 and 5500 mg p m2d orders of magnitude faster than p removal by typical in stream attenuation 10 250 mg p m2d ready et al 1999 svendsen and kronvang 1993 or in engineered treatment wetlands 100 400 mg p m2d bojcevska and tonderski 2007 braskerud 2002 the p concentrations via dilution resulting from conservatively mixing the three sources would have averaged 0 78 mg l as p classifying the stream well above the levels typically considered as eutrophic 0 08 mg l as p dodds et al 1998 gurung et al 2013 however the average po4 concentration at ds90 were often below detection indicating rapid in stream attenuation of po4 and improvement of the stream s trophic status to mesotrophic 0 03 0 08 mg l p with regards to p dodds et al 1998 gurung et al 2013 although the resultant n concentrations would still classify as eutrophic 1 5 mg l as n dodds et al 1998 it is important to note that p was likely the limiting nutrient for bradley run upstream of the mww discharge typical for freshwater systems clune et al 2020 dodds and smith 2016 hecky and kilham 1988 downstream of the discharge limited concentrations of p would be of even greater importance concerning algal production because of the highly elevated n concentrations contributed by the mww and not attenuated by mixing with md for example drerup and vis 2017 observed diminished biofilm productivity in md impaired and remediated streams owing to the limited availability of po4 3 2 factors affecting co attenuation of nutrients and metals results from this study indicate in stream physicochemical mechanisms result in a relatively high removal 90 of po4 al and fe while having smaller influence on no3 fig 4 a al removal was highly dependent r2 0 82 on stream ph fig 4b the highest removal occurred when the ph at ds90 exceeded 6 0 where al was always removed at 80 while removal varied between 65 and 90 when ds90 ph was 5 5 6 0 the inverse relation between ph and metals concentrations is consistent with precipitation of al oh 3 and fe oh 3 computations with phreeqc indicated saturation indices for gibbsite were greater than 0 supersaturated while those for amorphous al oh 3 were less than 0 undersaturated for all but a few samples whereas those for al oh 3 having solubility intermediate to gibbsite and amorphous al oh 3 ranged from 0 to 1 for two thirds of the samples implying equilibrium fig si 5 thus al oh 3 of intermediate solubility could feasibly control observed al concentrations in contrast more than 90 percent of samples having ph 7 were supersaturated with basaluminite al oh 2 5 so4 0 25 or hydrobasaluminite fig si 5 indicating kinetic barriers to precipitation of these al hydroxysulfate phases less pronounced decreases in fe concentrations were observed between the ph at ds90 and fe removal see fig si 4 this observation is consistent with partial oxidation of fe prior to and immediately after mixing and thus limited potential for precipitation of fe oh 3 slow oxidation kinetics of fe particularly at ph 6 are well documented e g stumm and morgan 1996 cravotta 2015 samples in the mixing zone ds90 site had a median ph of 5 4 however substantial fe removal was observed by ds950 which had ph ranging from 7 3 to 8 1 fig 2a assuming the oxidation state of fe in samples may be computed from do on the basis of the redox relation of sato 1960 saturation indices for goethite were always greater than 0 whereas those for amorphous fe oh 3 were less than 0 for 75 of the samples however all but two samples with ph 7 had saturation index 0 for amorphous fe oh 3 the removal rates for both dissolved al and fe are presented in fig 4c pseudo first order removal of both fe and al was 0 33 and 0 30 hr 1 respectively removals observed in this study are similar to fe rates 0 2 to 0 6 hr 1 previously quantified for streams impacted by md cravotta 2015 although the metals from md would slowly be removed via natural processes i e absent of mww over very long distances the co attenuation from addition of mww likely increased formation of precipitates upon mixing which attenuated dissolved metals leading to measurable water quality improvements within the study area the data in this study demonstrate strong langmuir isotherm behavior fig 4d supporting adsorption of po4 as a possible removal mechanism with a theoretical system maximum adsorption capacity qm of 0 43 mg p per mg metal this is in agreement with prior work interpreting po4 adsorption as a contributing removal mechanism in other md mww systems hughes and gray 2013 smyntek et al 2022 spellman et al 2020 wei et al 2008 the phreeqc modeling and related computations included in supplemental information and cravotta 2021a indicate in stream co attenuation mechanisms responsible for relatively high 90 po4 removal were likely adsorption onto fe oh 3 and al oh 3 particles and coatings on stream sediments e g pérez et al 2014 coupled with precipitation of crystalline to amorphous al po4 compounds e g variscite roncal herrero et al 2009 roncal herrero and oelkers 2011 saturation indices for variscite were 0 for more than 50 of the samples and were inversely correlated with ph fig si 5 indicating low ph samples had greater potential to precipitate alpo4 compounds than high ph samples an inverse correlation between the activity of al3 aal3 and activity of po4 3 apo4 3 fig 5 a and a positive correlation between apo4 3 and ph fig 5b are consistent with p solubility control by variscite or amorphous alpo4 particularly for samples having ph 7 0 as described earlier for al decreased aal 3 with increased ph is consistent with precipitation of al oh 3 having solubility intermediate between amorphous al oh 3 and crystalline gibbsite precipitation of al oh 3 is likely to be rapid seconds to minutes compared to alpo4 2h2o minutes to hours e g roncal herrero and oelkers 2011 and thus al oh 3 formation is likely to limit aqueous al concentrations fig 5b which assumes aal3 at equilibrium with al oh 3 shows most samples having ph 7 0 also have a po4 3 consistent with solubility delineated for variscite si 0 relative to equilibrium constant of mcbride 1994 to amorphous alpo4 variscite si 2 0 however for most of the ph 7 0 samples apo4 3 is less than variscite equilibrium values adsorption of po4 by al oh 3 and or fe oh 3 could maintain apo4 3 at those observed low levels for the high ph samples thus decreasing potential for variscite precipitation results of the phreeq n titration po4 adsorption simulations shown fig 6 indicate combined effects of adsorption and precipitation on po4 concentrations the models mix the us mww and md samples in proportions estimated for sample dates assuming all have initial ph of 2 and then subject the mixture to ph adjustment at 0 25 unit intervals instantaneous equilibrium precipitation and adsorption reactions occur in response to the ph increases for comparison one simulation mixes only us and mww samples without md and associated dissolved and precipitated metals this simulation does not explain the observed po4 data the models that simulate proportional mixing of us mww and md demonstrate that 1 efficient removal of po4 at ph 5 to 7 fig 6a may be explained by the precipitation of crystalline to amorphous alpo4 2h2o with solubilities considered by mcbride 1994 and stumm and morgan 1996 whereas 2 relatively inefficient removal of po4 at ph 5 or 7 fig 6b may be explained by the precipitation of highly soluble amorphous alpo4 and or adsorption to hydrous metal oxide hmeo containing predominantly al oh 3 with minor but important fe oh 3 explained below to simulate p precipitation for a range of potential saturation states the variscite solubility constant of mcbride 1994 is used as the reference state si 0 shown as black dotted curve in fig 6 to simulate precipitation of amorphous alpo4 saturation index values greater than 0 were specified at which solids would form for example the solubility constant of stumm and morgan 1996 which is 1 log unit greater than that of mcbride 1994 is equivalent to si 1 0 resulting in greater dissolved po4 at equilibrium with that higher solubility phase highly soluble amorphous alpo4 consistent with reporting by roncal herrero and oelkers 2011 was simulated by specifying si 2 0 to 2 5 as the equilibrium condition at which alpo4 precipitation could occur resulting in inefficient removal of po4 by precipitation the model results indicate that for cases where po4 attenuation is poor corresponding to ph 5 fig 6b adsorption could have a similar effect on po4 attenuation as precipitation of more soluble amorphous alpo4 for the model results shown in fig 6 previously accumulated hmeo is specified as having a constant mass 0 25 or 50 mg l with composition estimated as the percentage of al fe and mn any al oh 3 fe oh 3 or mnooh precipitated from solution is added to previously accumulated hmeo model results for 0hmeo specified hmeo mass 0 simulate conditions where sorption depends solely on fresh precipitate from dissolved al fe and mn in addition to the fresh precipitate other simulations include 25 or 50 mg l hmeo consisting of 98 al and 2 fe that relatively small mass of existing hmeo containing a small fraction of fe was adequate to simulate observations despite the relative abundance of accumulated al oh 3 po4 adsorption for this particular system is indicated to result mainly from the small amount of accumulated fe oh 3 which has greater affinity for po4 than an equal amount of al oh 3 increasing the mass of hmeo sorbent or the fraction of fe in the sorbent resulted in increased removal of po4 and also so4 which behaves conservatively and was not consistent with observations 3 3 implications of co attenuation the near complete removal of po4 from the downstream water in bradley run may be representative of other streams in the appalachian region and thus noteworthy in the context of the u s environmental protection agency s 2010 tmdl calling for a 24 reduction in total p loads entering the chesapeake bay watershed through the implementation of nutrient management practices considering the abundance of md and mww discharges in proximity to each other in the study area e g fig 1 and in other coal mined areas p removal via in stream interactions with md discharges may play an important role in decreasing overall nutrient loadings into major downstream water bodies based on the gallitzin mwwtp reported monthly average po4 discharges table si 2 the in stream co attenuation at bradley run alone could potentially remove between 810 and 950 kg yr of total p from the susquehanna river watershed this p is likely present as al fe po4 compounds and bound to hmeo deposited in bradley run because of sequestration of soluble p with sediment aquatic productivity may be diminished in amd impaired systems even after partial remediation bott et al 2012 drerup and vis 2017 nevertheless the p associated with such sediment could be transported downstream during high flow events or desorbed dissolved from those sediments in response to changing water chemistry extensive remediation and natural attenuation of md with consequent increases in ph and decreases in dissolved metals concentrations e g burrows et al 2015 younger et al 2002 may reduce the potential for precipitation of al fe po4 compounds and adsorption of po4 by hmeo unless water resource managers address pollutant reductions from p sources e g untreated or poorly treated mww discharges agricultural suburban urban runoff etc in conjunction with md remediation increased dissolved p availability and transport to downstream aquatic ecosystems will result 4 conclusions in stream interactions of po4 with al and fe resulted in 91 decrease in po4 concentrations compared to conservative mixing while no3 decreased by 20 al and fe were removed 90 from the water column as al oh 3 and fe oh 3 fe was removed at a faster rate than al inverse correlation between activities of po4 3 and al3 and corresponding saturation indices for crystalline to amorphous alpo4 2h2o i e variscite indicate equilibrium conditions for samples with ph 5 to 7 and potential co precipitation of al and po4 although precipitation of alpo4 2h2o could explain efficient removal of po4 such precipitation appeared to be inhibited or limited to formation of a high solubility amorphous phase when inefficient removal of p was observed adsorption of po4 was indicated as the predominant mechanism for po4 removal at ph 5 or 7 and likely to occur with alpo4 2h2o precipitation at ph 5 to 7 despite its relative abundance adsorption of po4 by al oh 3 was indicated as subordinate to adsorption by minor amounts of fe oh 3 in the mixed precipitate within the stream the results presented in this study suggest in stream dynamic interactions between mww and md lead to co attenuation of pollutants resulting in improved downstream trophic status and other water quality characteristics such as ph and metals concentrations in stream interactions between md and mww may play an important but under studied role in decreasing nutrient i e p and metal loadings to natural waterways via co attenuation in historic mining regions e g appalachia central andes xinjiang etc although results demonstrate co attenuation can improve downstream water quality co attenuation should not serve as the only option for abating these discharges due to the related uncontrolled deposition of metal oxyhydroxide solids and potential toxic effects to aquatic organisms resulting from gill clogging by precipitating solids additional study of the physical characteristics composition mineralogy and stability of metal rich precipitate formed by interaction of md and mww in the mixing zone would be beneficial to

16193,anaerobic digestion ad operating under organic overload stress usually increases the potential for process instability leading to significant economic and ecological consequences volatile fatty acids vfas accumulation is regularly considered a major factor during ad and their degradation is subject to thermodynamic constraints to date no study has systematically investigated the mechanisms of vfa degradation on process stability from the perspective of thermodynamics hence increased substrate to inoculum ratio was applied in this study to simulate organic overload stress using batch tests with hybrid pennisetum as a result vfas accumulation increased accompanied by decreased methane yield slower methane production kinetics and even severe process instability metagenomic analysis demonstrated that the accumulated propionate and butyrate were degraded by methyl malonyl coa and the β oxidation pathway while syntrophic acetate oxidation was preferred during acetate degradation the deviation of stability parameters to varying degrees from the recommended threshold values was observed however a subsequent thermodynamic analysis revealed that moderate organic overload stress merely retarded the syntrophic oxidation of propionate butyrate and acetate as a result the methanogenic activity decreased and the lag phase of ad was extended but no adverse thermodynamic effects actually occurred changes in the gibbs free energy for syntrophic propionate and acetate oxidation have the potential to better identify process stability this study provided novel insights into the underlying thermodynamic mechanisms of vfa degradation and may have important implications for improving the current diagnostic mode for ad process stability graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestion organic overload process stability substrate to inoculum ratio thermodynamic analysis volatile fatty acids 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad plays a positive role in energy structure optimization greenhouse gas reduction and environmental protection worldwide wu et al 2021a the conversion of organic material to biogas varies and largely depends on the applied substrate compared with commonly reported waste streams high yield perennial energy crops have received notable attention for biogas generation due to their high biomass yields low input requirements and lack of competition with land used for food production siri prieto et al 2020 an increase in substrate load is helpful to maximize the utilization of process capacity and methane yield however organic overload usually causes disruptions and stress in ad systems which will potentially increase the risk of process instability especially for lignocellulosic biomass with high total solid ts content and carbon to nitrogen c n ratios nguyen et al 2019 frequent occurrence of process instability events along with the adverse impact on the environment i e secondary pollution on microorganism propagation and surface water groundwater contamination are commonly reported in previous investigations westerholm et al 2019 wu et al 2021b therefore identifying process stability is the top priority and remains a critical issue acidogenic bacteria and methanogens have significantly different growth rates during the ad process and increasing substrate loads can further aggravate the imbalance causing severe volatile fatty acids vfas accumulation and even process instability awhangbo et al 2020 therefore vfas have long been widely accepted as critical factors in different kinds of ad systems and their variation in response to process disturbance is also regarded as an ideal state indicator related indicators i e acetate and propionate have been comprehensively reviewed recently in terms of their ability to identify process stability and predict instability wu et al 2021a thus a better understanding on the mechanism of vfa degradation under high organic loading stress can contribute to the improvement of the diagnostic mode for ad so that precautionary countermeasures can be taken in time related studies such as the exploration of physicochemical parameters li et al 2018a the establishment of simulation models wu et al 2019 and analyses of the microbial structure and function poirier et al 2016 are developing vigorously however in depth investigations and insights from the perspective of thermodynamics are rarely reported vfas degradation is strictly in accordance with thermodynamic characteristics and subject to thermodynamic constraints li et al 2020 in particular the degradation of long chain fatty acids lcfas i e propionate and butyrate requires thermodynamically favorable conditions during ad which means that the gibbs free energy δg must be negative this is mainly because the breakdown of lcfas to acetate and hydrogen h2 is an endergonic reaction to overcome the thermodynamic unfavorability it is necessary to siphon off newly formed products to maintain the concentration gradient in favor of the reactants and drive the oxidation process forward elsamadony et al 2021 this understanding can help in the investigation of the product concentrations that inhibit a bio reaction operating close to its thermodynamic equilibrium unfortunately the focus of related studies has primarily been the application of δg to describe the influence of changes in operational parameters i e temperature li et al 2020 and micro aeration nguyen et al 2019 and additives i e bicarbonate zhang et al 2018 and sulfate qiao et al 2016 on the performance of methane generation or the conversion of vfas during ad more importantly the biochemical reactions involved in ad are based on rather complex and diverse microbial roles de vrieze et al 2018 without microbial analysis for demonstration simply quoting commonly used equations from other studies for thermodynamic calculation lacks logical rigor and may result in misinterpretation or false assumptions to the best of our knowledge no study has combined thermodynamic analysis with traditional physicochemical and microbial analyses to systematically detail in depth investigations on how the kinetics of vfa accumulation and degradation varies with increased organic loadings and the subsequent effect on process stability during ad in this study a series of batch tests were conducted with increased substrate to inoculum s i ratios to simulate organic overload stress the objectives were 1 to evaluate the ad performance and process stability under different substrate loading stress and 2 to reveal the underlying thermodynamic mechanisms of key vfas degradation correlated with process instability based on a microbial analysis the potential of related thermodynamic parameters to identify process stability is also discussed 2 material and methods 2 1 substrate and inoculum the applied substrate was ensiled hybrid pennisetum pennisetum americanum p purpureum hp 3 months old obtained locally from zengcheng district in guangzhou city guangdong province china after collection the substrate was mixed and ground with an electrical kitchen blender to reduce the particle size to 1 mm and was stored at 20 c before use the inoculum was obtained from a 50 l laboratory thermophilic continuous stirred tank reactor cstr fed with a mixture of cattle manure and hp it has been operated for more than 100 days the current organic loading rate olr of this cstr is 3 g vs m 3 d 1 and hydraulic retention time hrt is 20 days daily biogas yield methane content and organic removal efficiency were within 10 of their average values after an operating period of at least three hrts the inoculum obtained for batch tests was degassed under the same thermophilic conditions to reduce endogenous biogas production the characteristics of the substrate and inoculum are presented in table s1 2 2 experimental setup for batch ad system owing to the high controllability of batch tests this experiment was carried out in batch bioreactors with a working volume of 800 ml under constant thermophilic conditions 50 1 c the s i ratios used in this study were 3 5 8 10 15 20 25 and 30 based on the volatile solid vs content and were labeled as r1 3 r2 5 r3 8 r4 10 r5 15 r6 20 r7 25 and r8 30 respectively briefly the concentration of inoculum in all reactors was 5 g vs l and organic overload stress was simulated by adding variant substrates afterward 20 v v of a medium containing macro and microelements and distilled water were added to each reactor to reach a working volume of 800 ml fig 1 the basal medium was prepared according to the method described previously raposo et al 2006 reactors without substrate addition were used as the control group and the methane yield for experimental groups was calculated by subtracting the methane yield for the control group the initial ph values in all batches were adjusted to 7 2 using 1 mol l hcl and naoh no extra c n ratios adjustment was conducted due to the sufficient concentration of total ammonia nitrogen tan contained in the inoculum the concentration of tan 200 mg l at the end of the experiment can also support this statement table s2 all of the reactors were purged with nitrogen gas for 5 min to create anaerobic conditions the reactors were then sealed with a rubber plug and pressed with an aluminum cover each reactor was placed in a water bath at predetermined temperatures after the temperature of the reactors reached that of the respective water bath a syringe was used to vent the gas produced by thermal expansion an increase in substrate load usually corresponds to higher ts content in ad consistent with the engineering practice and the ts content of these batches was within the recommended value of 12 voelklein et al 2016 mixing was rigorously conducted intermittently by manually shaking every 2 hours no foaming or rapid expansion event was observed during the whole experiment thus compared with other side effects such as high osmotic pressures and mass flow limitations the main influential factor was the variation in the s i ratio all experiments were terminated when the daily methane generation was less than 1 of the theoretical methane yield 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 chemical and metagenomic analysis biogas yield and composition were quantified daily the measured

nguyen et al 2019 temperature corrections for 50 c versus 25 c were made using the gibbs helmholz equation under standard conditions dolfing et al 2008 δg values pertaining to actual concentrations

shown in fig 2 a and b the daily methane yield dmy of r1 3 r7 25 increased in the early stage but decreased to a low level before the secondary peak the initial increase of dmy could be explained by the fast conversion of readily digestible fractions i e monosaccharides and proteins while the subsequent peak may be attributed to the degradation of relatively recalcitrant lignocellulosic components li et al 2018b subsequently the methane production rate fell but methane production continued and stabilized at a lower rate at the end of the experiment the cumulative methane yield cmy for r1 3 r3 8 increased as the s i ratio increased with further increases in the s i ratio no significant difference in cmy was observed for r4 10 and r5 15 when compared to the value for r3 8 p 0 05 when the substrate loading exceeded the above level as in r6 20 and r7 25 the cmy did not increase further but rather decreased by 7 06 0 26 and 9 72 1 77 compared to the value for r5 15 as for r8 30 only a small amount of biogas was detected in the first 9 days whereas no biogas was produced during the subsequent period indicating that severe process instability persisted throughout the entire period modified gompertz model was further employed to simulate the principal kinetic patterns of methane production during ad table 1 except for r8 30 which could not be simulated due to serious process instability the high coefficient r2 0 99 of r1 3 r7 25 suggested that the experimental results would fit well with the model similar rmax values were observed for r1 3 r4 10 and with further increases in the s i ratio decrease in the r max of r6 20 and r7 25 by 19 81 7 05 and 51 05 3 86 were observed when compared to that for r5 15 confirming the methanogenic activity was inhibited to various degrees furthermore a stepwise increase in the s i ratio also caused λ and t max to increase and notably the largest increases in both λ and t max were observed when the s i ratio increased from 20 to 25 suggesting greater microbial reorganizations may have occurred to adapt to the changing environment thus a moderate increase in s i helps to increase methane yield and an excessive s i will result in negative effects on methane generation kinetics or even worse the failure of ad the vsr for r1 3 r7 25 was in the range of 55 44 1 92 to 59 73 2 13 while in r8 30 it severely decreased to only 11 73 0 17 due to the complete cessation of ad accompanied by a significant accumulation of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin p 0 05 fig 2 c further the variation in the conversion efficiency at four stages indicated that the influence of an excessive s i ratio on ad performance was not only limited to the most concerned methane yield but also restrained the upstreaming hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis fig 2 d in particular although the stress in r1 3 was the lowest the overall conversion efficiency was the lowest among the reactors with consistent methane generation this case suggested that a lower substrate loading may not be able to trigger the maximum enzymatic activity of the microbes a similar concept was also reported by sambusiti et al 2014 the performance of undigested cellulose and hemicellulose can also support the above findings fig 2 c thus although a lower substrate load can ensure a fast methane generation process decreased enzyme activity may be otherwise unfavorable for the long term operation of ad fed with similar lignocellulosic feedstock after successful start up a moderate increase in organic loading is suggested to maximize the conversion efficiency at four stages 3 2 variation in the commonly used state indicators commonly used state indicators to evaluate the process stability of ad are shown in fig 3 the generation of vfas was immediate and massive amounts of total volatile fatty acids tvfas were observed during the first 5 days however there was no obvious vfa accumulation in r1 3 and r2 5 during the entire process whereas significant accumulation of vfas was observed at the early stage in r3 8 r7 25 process stability was also disrupted to various degrees during this period as evidenced by the fluctuation of critical state indicators beyond their recommended threshold values tvfa ba 0 4 and tvfa ta 0 35 wu et al 2021a table 2 the accumulated vfas in r3 8 r5 15 rapidly degraded within 10 days as the reaction progressed and subsequently remained at a low level conversely an obvious extended degradation period for vfas was observed in r6 20 and r7 25 acetate propionate and butyrate accounted for the majority of accumulated vfas in r3 8 r7 25 and these individual components continued to accumulate as the s i ratio increased especially acetate and butyrate which were significantly correlated p 0 001 fig s1 however regardless of the s i ratio acetate could always be degraded relatively quickly to a low level suggesting its moderate accumulation is harmless for process stability the degradation performance for butyrate was similar to that of acetate but the degradation rate was slower propionate had the slowest degradation rate and persisted during the subsequent ad process when both the acetate and butyrate in r3 8 r7 25 had degraded to low levels 0 2 g l propionate remained at a high concentration and continued to increase with the increase in the s i ratio ranging from 0 73 0 18 to 2 0 0 27 g l this difference between acetate propionate and butyrate was actually determined by the nature of the anaerobic microorganisms that utilized the vfas the specific growth rate of microorganisms is reported to be only 0 06 d 1 with propionate followed by butyrate ranging from 0 08 to 0 15 d 1 microorganisms growing on acetate have the highest specific growth rate of 0 3 d 1 due to their direct utilization of acetate li et al 2020 in other words the microorganisms involved in the degradation of acetate can better adapt to the disturbance caused by increased organic loading whereas a certain microbial adaptation period is required for the degradation of propionate and butyrate subsequently in r3 8 r7 25 with the continuous consumption of vfas and the concomitant increase in ba the severe acidification observed at the early stage was alleviated at the end of the experiment both tvfa ba and tvfa ta were close to 0 while the available buffer equilibrium namely ba ta had increased to a level similar to that of the inoculum congruently the initially decreased ph recovered thus although a clear inhibitory effect on methane yield and slower methane production kinetics were observed under increased organic loads the adverse effects of severe acidification at the early stage on the process stability of ad were actually reversible conversely in r8 30 the initial value of tvfa reached 10 0 0 11 g l while ba ta was only 0 30 0 01 tvfa ba was 11 times higher than the recommended threshold value suggesting a severe acid base imbalance as a result the accumulated vfas could not degrade smoothly and the phenomenon of severe over acidification became persistent this was mainly because of the rapid proliferation of hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria under organic overload slow growing methanogens were unable to proliferate as rapidly as possible and as a result the generated vfas could not be degraded over time ketheesan and stuckey 2015 ultimately vfas continued to accumulate and the amount of ba available decreased until it was completely consumed leading to a sharp reduction in the ph 5 5 in addition due to the inhibition on microorganisms cell mortality increased and consequently the organic nitrogen and protein stored in the cells were released into the reactor leading to an increased concentration of tan in r8 30 table s2 the phenomenon of over acidification caused by vfa accumulation at the early stage gradually became more severe as the s i ratio increased and the adverse effects on process stability could be either temporary or permanent severe process instability occurred when the tolerance of ad to perturbations broke down the metabolism of accumulated vfas might be the key factor that determines the process stability of ad 3 3 dominant metabolic pathway and equations for accumulated vfa degradation to provide insight into the behavior of anaerobic reactors and in particular to determine the dominant metabolic pathway for the accumulated vfa degradation inoculum lower r1 3 r4 10 and higher r7 25 r8 30 stress groups were selected and a total of 24 samples were collected for metagenomic analysis similarities between the microbial communities were evaluated using principal component analysis pca fig 4 and the similarity index was calculated by hierarchical clustering table s3 from the pca at the genus level samples inoculated with the same source clustered separately samples of r1 3 r4 10 and r7 25 at different sampling times were regularly distributed along with increasing s i while samples from r8 30 were almost completely separated from the others demonstrating a shift in the microbial communities in accordance with organic overload when sampling at 50 methanogenesis efficiency in different groups similarities in the microbial communities between r1 3 r4 10 r7 25 and the inoculum were 65 75 1 96 59 74 1 17 and 50 14 1 54 respectively as the reaction progressed the corresponding values reached 70 50 2 92 72 69 2 63 and 60 67 1 24 suggesting that higher stress will cause greater changes in microbial community structure consistent with the variations in the lag phases notably samples of r1 3 and r4 10 collected at the end of the experiment tended to cluster together with a similarity index of 79 90 1 87 but their similarities in composition to that of r7 25 were only 58 35 2 04 and 66 51 1 24 respectively implying that once the inhibitory effect was relieved the microbial community tended to evolve toward a less differentiated composition a similar concept was also reported by poirier et al 2016 shifts in the microbial community demonstrated the microbiome ability of self optimization and reorganization to adapt to stressed operating conditions and avoid process instability figure 5 a and b show microorganisms with significant differences among 24 samples and the functions of major genera are summarized in table s4 defluviitoga ruminiclostridium and clostridium were the predominant hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria due to their high abundance in all sampled groups which can be attributed to their ability to degrade various complex substances arelli et al 2021 defluviitoga ruminiclostridium and clostridium in r1 3 r4 10 and r7 25 were highly enriched initially but decreased as the reaction progressed this pattern is mainly attributed to the shifts in residue level and nutrition supply during ad zhou et al 2021 however ruminiclostridium and clostridium comprised the highest proportion at lower s i ratios while defluviitoga was the most predominant bacteria genus at higher ratios variations in the abundance of dominant hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria directly explained the difference in the performance of hydrolysis efficiency and indicated a higher organic load will stimulate the growth of defluviitoga the defluviitoga genus can metabolize sugars to generate acetate lactate ethanol h2 and co2 and ruminiclostridium and clostridium are commonly reported to be the main contributors to cellulose degradation li et al 2019 notably defluviitoga tunisiensis is more likely to degrade monosaccharides directly to acetate and h2 without producing propionate and butyrate hania et al 2011 therefore a high relative abundance of defluviitoga tunisiensis in r7 25 28 26 1 31 and r8 30 52 05 1 36 confirmed the massive generation of acetate and h2 at the early stage of ad leaving the subsequent biochemical reaction of vfa degradation prone to thermodynamic barriers syntrophy is a particularly mutualistic partnership in ad defined as a thermodynamically interdependent lifestyle where neither partner can operate without the other leng et al 2018 acetogens with significant differences included anaerobaculum desulfotomaculum syntrophomonas tepidanaerobacter bellilinea and pseudomonas fig 3 c except for anaerobaculum the levels of these syntrophic bacteria were relatively low 1 2 similar microbial results were also reported for ad systems subjected to stressed and high vfa concentrations nguyen et al 2019 the genus syntrophomonas has been associated with efficient acetogenic performance and is commonly reported to use the β oxidation pathway to break down butyrate to acetate and h2 following eq 4 du et al 2021 4 β oxidation c h 3 c h 2 c h 2 c o o 2 h 2 o 2 c h 3 c o o 2 h 2 h the relatively greater fraction of syntrophomonas in r1 3 r4 10 and r7 25 was helpful for the enhanced syntrophic degradation of butyrate subsequently its relative abundance decreased along with the consumption of butyrate however its abundance in r8 30 was merely 0 13 0 02 and significantly lower than that in the other groups p 0 05 this is consistent with the massive accumulation of butyrate in r8 30 during the entire process and corroborated the severe inhibition of butyrate degradation due to organic overload the randomized methyl malonyl coa pathway mmc eq 5 and the c 6 dismutation pathway eq 6 are two known pathways for propionate degradation dolfing 2017 5 mmc c h 3 c h 2 c o o 3 h 2 o c h 3 c o o 3 h 2 h c o 3 h 6 the c 6 dismutation pathway 2 c h 3 c h 2 c o o 2 h 2 o 3 c h 3 c o o 2 h 2 h the different stoichiometry shows that during the degradation of 1 mol propionate only 1 mol of h2 is produced in eq 6 while 3 mol of h2 in eq 5 can be generated this difference substantially affects the influence of partial pressure of h2 on the syntrophic oxidation of propionate lu et al 2013 also indicated that there is a significant range of conditions under which propionate oxidation via the c 6 dismutation pathway is exergonic whereas the mmc pathway would be endergonic suggesting that the c 6 dismutation pathway is more thermodynamically favorable however smithella the only known genus to utilize the c 6 dismutation pathway was not identified in this study in contrast the genera desulfotomaculum and bellilinea were identified and are known as typical propionate oxidizing bacteria pob that catalyze mmc pathway saha et al 2019 their abundance was relatively stable during different sampling times but their performance varied in r7 25 and r8 30 the abundance of desulfotomaculum in r7 25 was still comparable with that in r1 3 and r4 10 but the abundance of bellilinea was significantly lower p 0 05 the overall decrease in the abundance of key pob may explain the persistence of propionate in r7 25 and the corresponding low level of methane generation lasting for a long time in the latter stage during ad the abundance of desulfotomaculum and bellilinea was only 0 54 0 01 and 0 13 0 02 in r8 30 resulting in almost no consumption of propionate during the entire process methanosarcina was identified as the most abundant methanogenic genera followed by methanoculleus methanothermobacter and methanobacterium methanosarcina is a mixotrophic methanogen that can use acetate trimethylamine methanol h2 and co2 to produce methane its dominance under stressed operating conditions has been widely reported due to its fast growth rate and quick adaption to the changing environment the other three are typically regarded as hydrogenotrophic methanogens hm which can use co2 and h2 for methane generation zhao et al 2020 therefore acetate is either consumed by methanosarcina performing acetoclastic methanogenesis am also known as direct acetate cleavage eq 7 or by syntrophic acetate oxidation sao eq 8 7 am c h 3 c o o h 2 o c h 4 h c o 3 8 sao c h 3 c o o 4 h 2 o 2 h c o 3 4 h 2 h the microbial results confirmed the coexistence of eq 7 and eq 8 notably in r1 3 r4 10 and r7 25 a substantial increase in the abundance of methanosarcina and hm as well as the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathway fig 5 c was observed as the process progressed this finding was consistent with the results obtained regarding the increase in the abundance of defluviitoga ruminiclostridium and clostridium which can contribute to both the cellulose degradation and the production of h2 and acetate on the other hand the degradation of propionate and butyrate is essentially a multi step syntrophic oxidation process that can release a large quantity of h2 to stimulate the growth of hm in turn the increasing abundance of hm eliminates the adverse effects of excessively produced h2 creating a thermodynamically favorable operating condition thus acetate degradation by sao may be preferred at high organic loads previous reports also indicate that at stressed conditions sao can replace am to alleviate the inhibitory effect so as to maintain process stability and even compensate for biogas yield pan et al 2020 at the end of the experiment the relative abundance of methanogens in r4 10 was the highest followed by r1 3 and r7 25 their response to increasing s i was consistent with the methane generation performance methanogens in r8 30 however were inhibited to only 2 75 0 63 indicating the severe inhibition of methanogenesis and a total crash during the entire ad process 3 4 thermodynamics of vfa degradation to further reinforce the microbial findings and explore the effects of organic overload on the mechanism of vfa degradation as well as the subsequent effect on process stability thermodynamic calculations targeting r1 3 r4 10 r7 25 and r8 30 were performed using the obtained equations table s5 massive production of h2 was observed at the early stage consistent with the accumulation of acetate acetate is a pivotal intermediate during ad due to its direct relationship with methane generation sao cannot theoretically occur spontaneously due to the positive g values under standard conditions table s5 however under the combined influence of the interactions of syntrophic bacteria and the continuing decrease in h2 g for acetate degradation by sao δ g s a o in r1 3 r4 10 and r7 25 was negative ranging from 40 to 70 kj mol fig 6 and was always lower than the g for acetate degradation by am δ g a m 25 50 kj mol although sao did not readily occur spontaneously due to thermodynamic constraints once the sequential sao reaction channel was opened the efficiency of acetate degradation by sao was actually faster than the direct cleavage of acetate by am even though the dominant sao can result in further contributions to h2 production therefore the pressure of natural selection led to the evolution of more syntrophs and hm following the prevalence pathway of sao seems rational during the entire process in r1 3 r4 10 and r7 25 g for propionate oxidation δ g p r o p i o n a t e and butyrate oxidation δ g b u t y r a t e were in the range of 30 75 kj mol and 45 85 kj mol respectively fig 6 both of these values are lower than those obtained by li et al 2020 and qiao et al 2016 under mesophilic conditions this is rational because the operating temperature in this study is higher which would facilitate the syntrophic degradation of propionate and butyrate due to the advantages of thermodynamics and kinetics li et al 2020 regardless of the s i ratio butyrate degradation was more thermodynamically favorable and more straightforward than that of propionate because δ g b u t y r a t e is lower than δ g p r o p i o n a t e eq 4 also shows that each mole of butyrate can be converted into two moles of acetate hence decreases in the acetate concentration can accelerate butyrate degradation ketheesan and stuckey 2015 concisely although differences exist in the specific growth rate of anaerobic microorganisms that utilize acetate and butyrate the overall metabolic performance of butyrate degradation under moderate organic loadings stress can also recover from the disturbance which is similar to that of acetate propionate degradation is the most thermodynamic unfavorable process due to the high δg values with the decrease of acetate and butyrate concentration in r1 3 r4 10 and r7 25 the high level of propionate also exhibited an obvious downward degradation trend a similar concept also indicated that the rapid decrease of acetate and butyrate can be regarded as a signal for the recovery of anaerobic microorganisms that utilize propionate qiao et al 2016 δ g p r o p i o n a t e was negative and gradually decreased as the syntrophic reaction progressed however unlike butyrate which decreased significantly with a sharp decrease in h2 propionate had the slowest degradation rate and dominated for a long time during the latter period of ad with the increase in s i ratio propionate degradation became more prolonged in r4 10 which had the optimum reactor performance δ g p r o p i o n a t e was 49 67 1 79 kj mol on day 5 while in r7 25 it took at least 7 days for δ g p r o p i o n a t e to decrease from 31 97 4 68 kj mol to a similar value fig 6 this behavior is consistent with the performance of the lag phase and the slow decrease in δ g p r o p i o n a t e also confirmed that the syntrophic propionate degradation recovered more slowly from disruption as the s i ratio continued to increase unlike the performance of δ g s a o δ g p r o p i o n a t e and δ g b u t y r a t e which gradually decreased as the reaction progressed due to the massive accumulation of h2 and acetate at the early stage in r8 30 δ g p r o p i o n a t e and δ g s a o were the first to reach a positive value directly indicating the degradation of propionate and acetate by syntrophic acetogenic bacteria had become thermodynamically unfeasible although negative values were still observed for δ g b u t y r a t e these values were significantly higher than those obtained in other groups p 0 01 subsequently δ g b u t y r a t e continued to increase as acetate and h2 accumulation became more severe indicating the occurrence of syntrophic butyrate oxidation was actually more difficult in turn the slower degradation rate contributed to further butyrate accumulation fig 3 combined with the analysis on ad performance and process stability it can be concluded that under high organic loading stress the deviation of stability parameters to various degrees from the recommended threshold values merely suggested the existence of thermodynamic constraints for ad however no adverse thermodynamic effects occurred as the actual δg values for the main accumulated vfa degradation were always at a negative value indeed the stepwise increase in the s i ratio only increased the values of δ g s a o δ g p r o p i o n a t e and δ g b u t y r a t e at the early stage retarding the syntrophic oxidation process for acetate propionate and butyrate further resulting in the extension of the lag phase and the decrease in the methanogenic activity of ad fig s2 the over acidification at the early stage gradually became more severe subsequently positive values for δ g p r o p i o n a t e and δ g s a o were first observed in r8 30 indicating the syntrophic propionate and acetate oxidation reached thermodynamic equilibrium and bio reactions ceased consequently substrate degradation by hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria to generate acetate and h2 continued until feedback inhibition occurred terminating the upstream processes and resulting in the total crash of the ad system 3 5 implication ad exposed to organic overloading usually results in decreased electricity production digester reinitialization and secondary pollution due to the massive generation of acidic digestion digestate if not handled properly monitoring specific state indicators at regular intervals can provide insights into what happens in anaerobic reactors and hence the selection of ideal state indicators and the corresponding diagnostic mode is particularly important the common practice to diagnose process stability at the industrial level is to set threshold values for related state indicators the current process status of ad is evaluated and process instability is predicted based on the degree of deviation of the threshold values wu et al 2021a however stable and continuous methane generation can also be found beyond these threshold limits due to the specific configuration of operational parameters of ad reactors and a different composition and adaptability of microbes in the inoculum therefore the diagnostic mode remains primitive and lacks universality to our knowledge this is the first study to systematically reveal the thermodynamic mechanism of key vfas degradation under increasing organic loadings and provides a new theoretical basis for its further improvement notably on day 5 in r7 25 and r8 30 similar values for ph and alkalinity were observed as well as large deviations in the state indicators from the recommended threshold values either jointly or independently based on the above however only the occurrence of severe disturbance can be confirmed it is impossible to make a diagnosis and speculate whether the ad system of interest can withstand the current organic loadings to continue functioning in contrast the performance of δ g p r o p i o n a t e and δ g s a o under increased organic loading stress demonstrated that the key metabolic process was syntrophic propionate degradation by mmc and acetate degradation by sao to be more specific the δ g p r o p i o n a t e and δ g s a o values were negative in r7 25 while both values were positive at the same time point in r8 30 combined with the analysis on commonly used state indicators it can be concluded that δ g p r o p i o n a t e and δ g s a o are better able to identify the process status in response to organic overload in addition a gradual increase of both values was also observed along with increasing organic loadings when the overall ad performance was not crashed suggesting a potential to be used as alternative early warning indicators unfortunately due to the limitation of batch tests that is the negative impact of shock loading caused by a single large dosage it might be impossible to accurately determine whether δ g p r o p i o n a t e or δ g s a o will be inhibited first research conducted in continuous mode is merited for further exploration and to confirm its actual potential applicability to provide an early warning 4 conclusion vfa accumulation became more severe as the organic loading stress increased accompanied by decreased methane yield slower methane production kinetics and even severe process instability acetate propionate and butyrate accounted for the majority of accumulated vfas in ad metagenomic analysis demonstrated that propionate and butyrate were degraded by methyl malonyl coa and the β oxidation pathway while syntrophic acetate oxidation was preferred during acetate degradation the thermodynamic disadvantage was more pronounced under high organic loadings when s i was in the range from 3 to 25 increased organic loading stress merely retarded the syntrophic oxidation of propionate butyrate and acetate resulting in the decrease of methanogenic activity and the extension of the lag phase of ad but no adverse thermodynamic effects actually occurred the key to process instability is syntrophic propionate and acetate oxidation changes in the gibbs free energy for syntrophic propionate and acetate oxidation provided a novel concept for upgrading the diagnostic mode for ad process stability author

16193,anaerobic digestion ad operating under organic overload stress usually increases the potential for process instability leading to significant economic and ecological consequences volatile fatty acids vfas accumulation is regularly considered a major factor during ad and their degradation is subject to thermodynamic constraints to date no study has systematically investigated the mechanisms of vfa degradation on process stability from the perspective of thermodynamics hence increased substrate to inoculum ratio was applied in this study to simulate organic overload stress using batch tests with hybrid pennisetum as a result vfas accumulation increased accompanied by decreased methane yield slower methane production kinetics and even severe process instability metagenomic analysis demonstrated that the accumulated propionate and butyrate were degraded by methyl malonyl coa and the β oxidation pathway while syntrophic acetate oxidation was preferred during acetate degradation the deviation of stability parameters to varying degrees from the recommended threshold values was observed however a subsequent thermodynamic analysis revealed that moderate organic overload stress merely retarded the syntrophic oxidation of propionate butyrate and acetate as a result the methanogenic activity decreased and the lag phase of ad was extended but no adverse thermodynamic effects actually occurred changes in the gibbs free energy for syntrophic propionate and acetate oxidation have the potential to better identify process stability this study provided novel insights into the underlying thermodynamic mechanisms of vfa degradation and may have important implications for improving the current diagnostic mode for ad process stability graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestion organic overload process stability substrate to inoculum ratio thermodynamic analysis volatile fatty acids 1 introduction anaerobic digestion ad plays a positive role in energy structure optimization greenhouse gas reduction and environmental protection worldwide wu et al 2021a the conversion of organic material to biogas varies and largely depends on the applied substrate compared with commonly reported waste streams high yield perennial energy crops have received notable attention for biogas generation due to their high biomass yields low input requirements and lack of competition with land used for food production siri prieto et al 2020 an increase in substrate load is helpful to maximize the utilization of process capacity and methane yield however organic overload usually causes disruptions and stress in ad systems which will potentially increase the risk of process instability especially for lignocellulosic biomass with high total solid ts content and carbon to nitrogen c n ratios nguyen et al 2019 frequent occurrence of process instability events along with the adverse impact on the environment i e secondary pollution on microorganism propagation and surface water groundwater contamination are commonly reported in previous investigations westerholm et al 2019 wu et al 2021b therefore identifying process stability is the top priority and remains a critical issue acidogenic bacteria and methanogens have significantly different growth rates during the ad process and increasing substrate loads can further aggravate the imbalance causing severe volatile fatty acids vfas accumulation and even process instability awhangbo et al 2020 therefore vfas have long been widely accepted as critical factors in different kinds of ad systems and their variation in response to process disturbance is also regarded as an ideal state indicator related indicators i e acetate and propionate have been comprehensively reviewed recently in terms of their ability to identify process stability and predict instability wu et al 2021a thus a better understanding on the mechanism of vfa degradation under high organic loading stress can contribute to the improvement of the diagnostic mode for ad so that precautionary countermeasures can be taken in time related studies such as the exploration of physicochemical parameters li et al 2018a the establishment of simulation models wu et al 2019 and analyses of the microbial structure and function poirier et al 2016 are developing vigorously however in depth investigations and insights from the perspective of thermodynamics are rarely reported vfas degradation is strictly in accordance with thermodynamic characteristics and subject to thermodynamic constraints li et al 2020 in particular the degradation of long chain fatty acids lcfas i e propionate and butyrate requires thermodynamically favorable conditions during ad which means that the gibbs free energy δg must be negative this is mainly because the breakdown of lcfas to acetate and hydrogen h2 is an endergonic reaction to overcome the thermodynamic unfavorability it is necessary to siphon off newly formed products to maintain the concentration gradient in favor of the reactants and drive the oxidation process forward elsamadony et al 2021 this understanding can help in the investigation of the product concentrations that inhibit a bio reaction operating close to its thermodynamic equilibrium unfortunately the focus of related studies has primarily been the application of δg to describe the influence of changes in operational parameters i e temperature li et al 2020 and micro aeration nguyen et al 2019 and additives i e bicarbonate zhang et al 2018 and sulfate qiao et al 2016 on the performance of methane generation or the conversion of vfas during ad more importantly the biochemical reactions involved in ad are based on rather complex and diverse microbial roles de vrieze et al 2018 without microbial analysis for demonstration simply quoting commonly used equations from other studies for thermodynamic calculation lacks logical rigor and may result in misinterpretation or false assumptions to the best of our knowledge no study has combined thermodynamic analysis with traditional physicochemical and microbial analyses to systematically detail in depth investigations on how the kinetics of vfa accumulation and degradation varies with increased organic loadings and the subsequent effect on process stability during ad in this study a series of batch tests were conducted with increased substrate to inoculum s i ratios to simulate organic overload stress the objectives were 1 to evaluate the ad performance and process stability under different substrate loading stress and 2 to reveal the underlying thermodynamic mechanisms of key vfas degradation correlated with process instability based on a microbial analysis the potential of related thermodynamic parameters to identify process stability is also discussed 2 material and methods 2 1 substrate and inoculum the applied substrate was ensiled hybrid pennisetum pennisetum americanum p purpureum hp 3 months old obtained locally from zengcheng district in guangzhou city guangdong province china after collection the substrate was mixed and ground with an electrical kitchen blender to reduce the particle size to 1 mm and was stored at 20 c before use the inoculum was obtained from a 50 l laboratory thermophilic continuous stirred tank reactor cstr fed with a mixture of cattle manure and hp it has been operated for more than 100 days the current organic loading rate olr of this cstr is 3 g vs m 3 d 1 and hydraulic retention time hrt is 20 days daily biogas yield methane content and organic removal efficiency were within 10 of their average values after an operating period of at least three hrts the inoculum obtained for batch tests was degassed under the same thermophilic conditions to reduce endogenous biogas production the characteristics of the substrate and inoculum are presented in table s1 2 2 experimental setup for batch ad system owing to the high controllability of batch tests this experiment was carried out in batch bioreactors with a working volume of 800 ml under constant thermophilic conditions 50 1 c the s i ratios used in this study were 3 5 8 10 15 20 25 and 30 based on the volatile solid vs content and were labeled as r1 3 r2 5 r3 8 r4 10 r5 15 r6 20 r7 25 and r8 30 respectively briefly the concentration of inoculum in all reactors was 5 g vs l and organic overload stress was simulated by adding variant substrates afterward 20 v v of a medium containing macro and microelements and distilled water were added to each reactor to reach a working volume of 800 ml fig 1 the basal medium was prepared according to the method described previously raposo et al 2006 reactors without substrate addition were used as the control group and the methane yield for experimental groups was calculated by subtracting the methane yield for the control group the initial ph values in all batches were adjusted to 7 2 using 1 mol l hcl and naoh no extra c n ratios adjustment was conducted due to the sufficient concentration of total ammonia nitrogen tan contained in the inoculum the concentration of tan 200 mg l at the end of the experiment can also support this statement table s2 all of the reactors were purged with nitrogen gas for 5 min to create anaerobic conditions the reactors were then sealed with a rubber plug and pressed with an aluminum cover each reactor was placed in a water bath at predetermined temperatures after the temperature of the reactors reached that of the respective water bath a syringe was used to vent the gas produced by thermal expansion an increase in substrate load usually corresponds to higher ts content in ad consistent with the engineering practice and the ts content of these batches was within the recommended value of 12 voelklein et al 2016 mixing was rigorously conducted intermittently by manually shaking every 2 hours no foaming or rapid expansion event was observed during the whole experiment thus compared with other side effects such as high osmotic pressures and mass flow limitations the main influential factor was the variation in the s i ratio all experiments were terminated when the daily

nguyen et al 2019 temperature corrections for 50 c versus 25 c were made using the gibbs helmholz equation under standard conditions dolfing et al 2008 δg values pertaining to actual concentrations and partial pressures were calculated using the nernst and van t hoff equation thauer et al 1977 the basis for selecting equations that are used for thermodynamic calculation can be found in section 3 3 details of the thermodynamic calculation procedures can be found in appendix a text s4 2 3 4 statistical analysis all experiments were carried out in triplicate and the results were expressed as mean standard deviation statistical significance was determined by an analysis of variance anova and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactor performance as shown in fig 2 a and b the daily methane yield dmy of r1 3 r7 25 increased in the early stage but decreased to a low level before the secondary peak the initial increase of dmy could be explained by the fast conversion of readily digestible fractions i e monosaccharides and proteins while the subsequent peak may be attributed to the degradation of relatively recalcitrant lignocellulosic components li et al 2018b subsequently the methane production rate fell but methane production continued and stabilized at a lower rate at the end of the experiment the cumulative methane yield cmy for r1 3 r3 8 increased as the s i ratio increased with further increases in the s i ratio no significant difference in cmy was observed for r4 10 and r5 15 when compared to the value for r3 8 p 0 05 when the substrate loading exceeded the above level as in r6 20 and r7 25 the cmy did not increase further but rather decreased by 7 06 0 26 and 9 72 1 77 compared to the value for r5 15 as for r8 30 only a small amount of biogas was detected in the first 9 days whereas no biogas was produced during the subsequent period indicating that severe process instability persisted throughout the entire period modified gompertz model was further employed to simulate the principal kinetic patterns of methane production during ad table 1 except for r8 30 which could not be simulated due to serious process instability the high coefficient r2 0 99 of r1 3 r7 25 suggested that the experimental results would fit well with the model similar rmax values were observed for r1 3 r4 10 and with further increases in the s i ratio decrease in the r max of r6 20 and r7 25 by 19 81 7 05 and 51 05 3 86 were observed when compared to that for r5 15 confirming the methanogenic activity was inhibited to various degrees furthermore a stepwise increase in the s i ratio also caused λ and t max to increase and notably the largest increases in both λ and t max were observed when the s i ratio increased from 20 to 25 suggesting greater microbial reorganizations may have occurred to adapt to the changing environment thus a moderate increase in s i helps to increase methane yield and an excessive s i will result in negative effects on methane generation kinetics or even worse the failure of ad the vsr for r1 3 r7 25 was in the range of 55 44 1 92 to 59 73 2 13 while in r8 30 it severely decreased to only 11 73 0 17 due to the complete cessation of ad accompanied by a significant accumulation of cellulose hemicellulose and lignin p 0 05 fig 2 c further the variation in the conversion efficiency at four stages indicated that the influence of an excessive s i ratio on ad performance was not only limited to the most concerned methane yield but also restrained the upstreaming hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis fig 2 d in particular although the stress in r1 3 was the lowest the overall conversion efficiency was the lowest among the reactors with consistent methane generation this case suggested that a lower substrate loading may not be able to trigger the maximum enzymatic activity of the microbes a similar concept was also reported by sambusiti et al 2014 the performance of undigested cellulose and hemicellulose can also support the above findings fig 2 c thus although a lower substrate load can ensure a fast methane generation process decreased enzyme activity may be otherwise unfavorable for the long term operation of ad fed with similar lignocellulosic feedstock after successful start up a moderate increase in organic loading is suggested to maximize the conversion efficiency at four stages 3 2 variation in the commonly used state indicators commonly used state indicators to evaluate the process stability of ad are shown in fig 3 the generation of vfas was immediate and massive amounts of total volatile fatty acids tvfas were observed during the first 5 days however there was no obvious vfa accumulation in r1 3 and r2 5 during the entire process whereas significant accumulation of vfas was observed at the early stage in r3 8 r7 25 process stability was also disrupted to various degrees during this period as evidenced by the fluctuation of critical state indicators beyond their recommended threshold values tvfa ba 0 4 and tvfa ta 0 35 wu et al 2021a table 2 the accumulated vfas in r3 8 r5 15 rapidly degraded within 10 days as the reaction progressed and subsequently remained at a low level conversely an obvious extended degradation period for vfas was observed in r6 20 and r7 25 acetate propionate and butyrate accounted for the majority of accumulated vfas in r3 8 r7 25 and these individual components continued to accumulate as the s i ratio increased especially acetate and butyrate which were significantly correlated p 0 001 fig s1 however regardless of the s i ratio acetate could always be degraded relatively quickly to a low level suggesting its moderate accumulation is harmless for process stability the degradation performance for butyrate was similar to that of acetate but the degradation rate was slower propionate had the slowest degradation rate and persisted during the subsequent ad process when both the acetate and butyrate in r3 8 r7 25 had degraded to low levels 0 2 g l propionate remained at a high concentration and continued to increase with the increase in the s i ratio ranging from 0 73 0 18 to 2 0 0 27 g l this difference between acetate propionate and butyrate was actually determined by the nature of the anaerobic microorganisms that utilized the vfas the specific growth rate of microorganisms is reported to be only 0 06 d 1 with propionate followed by butyrate ranging from 0 08 to 0 15 d 1 microorganisms growing on acetate have the highest specific growth rate of 0 3 d 1 due to their direct utilization of acetate li et al 2020 in other words the microorganisms involved in the degradation of acetate can better adapt to the disturbance caused by increased organic loading whereas a certain microbial adaptation period is required for the degradation of propionate and butyrate subsequently in r3 8 r7 25 with the continuous consumption of vfas and the concomitant increase in ba the severe acidification observed at the early stage was alleviated at the end of the experiment both tvfa ba and tvfa ta were close to 0 while the available buffer equilibrium namely ba ta had increased to a level similar to that of the inoculum congruently the initially decreased ph recovered thus although a clear inhibitory effect on methane yield and slower methane production kinetics were observed under increased organic loads the adverse effects of severe acidification at the early stage on the process stability of ad were actually reversible conversely in r8 30 the initial value of tvfa reached 10 0 0 11 g l while ba ta was only 0 30 0 01 tvfa ba was 11 times higher than the recommended threshold value suggesting a severe acid base imbalance as a result the accumulated vfas could not degrade smoothly and the phenomenon of severe over acidification became persistent this was mainly because of the rapid proliferation of hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria under organic overload slow growing methanogens were unable to proliferate as rapidly as possible and as a result the generated vfas could not be degraded over time ketheesan and stuckey 2015 ultimately vfas continued to accumulate and the amount of ba available decreased until it was completely consumed leading to a sharp reduction in the ph 5 5 in addition due to the inhibition on microorganisms cell mortality increased and consequently the organic nitrogen and protein stored in the cells were released into the reactor leading to an increased concentration of tan in r8 30 table s2 the phenomenon of over acidification caused by vfa accumulation at the early stage gradually became more severe as the s i ratio increased and the adverse effects on process stability could be either temporary or permanent severe process instability occurred when the tolerance of ad to perturbations broke down the metabolism of accumulated vfas might be the key factor that determines the process stability of ad 3 3 dominant metabolic pathway and equations for accumulated vfa degradation to provide insight into the behavior of anaerobic reactors and in particular to determine the dominant metabolic pathway for the accumulated vfa degradation inoculum lower r1 3 r4 10 and higher r7 25 r8 30 stress groups were selected and a total of 24 samples were collected for metagenomic analysis similarities between the microbial communities were evaluated using principal component analysis pca fig 4 and the similarity index was calculated by hierarchical clustering table s3 from the pca at the genus level samples inoculated with the same source clustered separately samples of r1 3 r4 10 and r7 25 at different sampling times were regularly distributed along with increasing s i while samples from r8 30 were almost completely separated from the others demonstrating a shift in the microbial communities in accordance with organic overload when sampling at 50 methanogenesis efficiency in different groups similarities in the microbial communities between r1 3 r4 10 r7 25 and the inoculum were 65 75 1 96 59 74 1 17 and 50 14 1 54 respectively as the reaction progressed the corresponding values reached 70 50 2 92 72 69 2 63 and 60 67 1 24 suggesting that higher stress will cause greater changes in microbial community structure consistent with the variations in the lag phases notably samples of r1 3 and r4 10 collected at the end of the experiment tended to cluster together with a similarity index of 79 90 1 87 but their similarities in composition to that of r7 25 were only 58 35 2 04 and 66 51 1 24 respectively implying that once the inhibitory effect was relieved the microbial community tended to evolve toward a less differentiated composition a similar concept was also reported by poirier et al 2016 shifts in the microbial community demonstrated the microbiome ability of self optimization and reorganization to adapt to stressed operating conditions and avoid process instability figure 5 a and b show microorganisms with significant differences among 24 samples and the functions of major genera are summarized in table s4 defluviitoga ruminiclostridium and clostridium were the predominant hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria due to their high abundance in all sampled groups which can be attributed to their ability to degrade various complex substances arelli et al 2021 defluviitoga ruminiclostridium and clostridium in r1 3 r4 10 and r7 25 were highly enriched initially but decreased as the reaction progressed this pattern is mainly attributed to the shifts in residue level and nutrition supply during ad zhou et al 2021 however ruminiclostridium and clostridium comprised the highest proportion at lower s i ratios while defluviitoga was the most predominant bacteria genus at higher ratios variations in the abundance of dominant hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria directly explained the difference in the performance of hydrolysis efficiency and indicated a higher organic load will stimulate the growth of defluviitoga the defluviitoga genus can metabolize sugars to generate acetate lactate ethanol h2 and co2 and ruminiclostridium and clostridium are commonly reported to be the main contributors to cellulose degradation li et al 2019 notably defluviitoga tunisiensis is more likely to degrade monosaccharides directly to acetate and h2 without producing propionate and butyrate hania et al 2011 therefore a high relative abundance of defluviitoga tunisiensis in r7 25 28 26 1 31 and r8 30 52 05 1 36 confirmed the massive generation of acetate and h2 at the early stage of ad leaving the subsequent biochemical reaction of vfa degradation prone to thermodynamic barriers syntrophy is a particularly mutualistic partnership in ad defined as a thermodynamically interdependent lifestyle where neither partner can operate without the other leng et al 2018 acetogens with significant differences included anaerobaculum desulfotomaculum syntrophomonas tepidanaerobacter bellilinea and pseudomonas fig 3 c except for anaerobaculum the levels of these syntrophic bacteria were relatively low 1 2 similar microbial results were also reported for ad systems subjected to stressed and high vfa concentrations nguyen et al 2019 the genus syntrophomonas has been associated with efficient acetogenic performance and is commonly reported to use the β oxidation pathway to break down butyrate to acetate and h2 following eq 4 du et al 2021 4 β oxidation c h 3 c h 2 c h 2 c o o 2 h 2 o 2 c h 3 c o o 2 h 2 h the relatively greater fraction of syntrophomonas in r1 3 r4 10 and r7 25 was helpful for the enhanced syntrophic degradation of butyrate subsequently its relative abundance decreased along with the consumption of butyrate however its abundance in r8 30 was merely 0 13 0 02 and significantly lower than that in the other groups p 0 05 this is consistent with the massive accumulation of butyrate in r8 30 during the entire process and corroborated the severe inhibition of butyrate degradation due to organic overload the randomized methyl malonyl coa pathway mmc eq 5 and the c 6 dismutation pathway eq 6 are two known pathways for propionate degradation dolfing 2017 5 mmc c h 3 c h 2 c o o 3 h 2 o c h 3 c o o 3 h 2 h c o 3 h 6 the c 6 dismutation pathway 2 c h 3 c h 2 c o o 2 h 2 o 3 c h 3 c o o 2 h 2 h the different stoichiometry shows that during the degradation of 1 mol propionate only 1 mol of h2 is produced in eq 6 while 3 mol of h2 in eq 5 can be generated this difference substantially affects the influence of partial pressure of h2 on the syntrophic oxidation of propionate lu et al 2013 also indicated that there is a significant range of conditions under which propionate oxidation via the c 6 dismutation pathway is exergonic whereas the mmc pathway would be endergonic suggesting that the c 6 dismutation pathway is more thermodynamically favorable however smithella the only known genus to utilize the c 6 dismutation pathway was not identified in this study in contrast the genera desulfotomaculum and bellilinea were identified and are known as typical propionate oxidizing bacteria pob that catalyze mmc pathway saha et al 2019 their abundance was relatively stable during different sampling times but their performance varied in r7 25 and r8 30 the abundance of desulfotomaculum in r7 25 was still comparable with that in r1 3 and r4 10 but the abundance of bellilinea was significantly lower p 0 05 the overall decrease in the abundance of key pob may explain the persistence of propionate in r7 25 and the corresponding low level of methane generation lasting for a long time in the latter stage during ad the abundance of desulfotomaculum and bellilinea was only 0 54 0 01 and 0 13 0 02 in r8 30 resulting in almost no consumption of propionate during the entire process methanosarcina was identified as the most abundant methanogenic genera followed by methanoculleus methanothermobacter and methanobacterium methanosarcina is a mixotrophic methanogen that can use acetate trimethylamine methanol h2 and co2 to produce methane its dominance under stressed operating conditions has been widely reported due to its fast growth rate and quick adaption to the changing environment the other three are typically regarded as hydrogenotrophic methanogens hm which can use co2 and h2 for methane generation zhao et al 2020 therefore acetate is either consumed by methanosarcina performing acetoclastic methanogenesis am also known as direct acetate cleavage eq 7 or by syntrophic acetate oxidation sao eq 8 7 am c h 3 c o o h 2 o c h 4 h c o 3 8 sao c h 3 c o o 4 h 2 o 2 h c o 3 4 h 2 h the microbial results confirmed the coexistence of eq 7 and eq 8 notably in r1 3 r4 10 and r7 25 a substantial increase in the abundance of methanosarcina and hm as well as the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathway fig 5 c was observed as the process progressed this finding was consistent with the results obtained regarding the increase in the abundance of defluviitoga ruminiclostridium and clostridium which can contribute to both the cellulose degradation and the production of h2 and acetate on the other hand the degradation of propionate and butyrate is essentially a multi step syntrophic oxidation process that can release a large quantity of h2 to stimulate the growth of hm in turn the increasing abundance of hm eliminates the adverse effects of excessively produced h2 creating a thermodynamically favorable operating condition thus acetate degradation by sao may be preferred at high organic loads previous reports also indicate that at stressed conditions sao can replace am to alleviate the inhibitory effect so as to maintain process stability and even compensate for biogas yield pan et al 2020 at the end of the experiment the relative abundance of methanogens in r4 10 was the highest followed by r1 3 and r7 25 their response to increasing s i was consistent with the methane generation performance methanogens in r8 30 however were inhibited to only 2 75 0 63 indicating the severe inhibition of methanogenesis and a total crash during the entire ad process 3 4 thermodynamics of vfa degradation to further reinforce the microbial findings and explore the effects of organic overload on the mechanism of vfa degradation as well as the subsequent effect on process stability thermodynamic calculations targeting r1 3 r4 10 r7 25 and r8 30 were performed using the obtained equations table s5 massive production of h2 was observed at the early stage consistent with the accumulation of acetate acetate is a pivotal intermediate during ad due to its direct relationship with methane generation sao cannot theoretically occur spontaneously due to the positive g values under standard conditions table s5 however under the combined influence of the interactions of syntrophic bacteria and the continuing decrease in h2 g for acetate degradation by sao δ g s a o in r1 3 r4 10 and r7 25 was negative ranging from 40 to 70 kj mol fig 6 and was always lower than the g for acetate degradation by am δ g a m 25 50 kj mol although sao did not readily occur spontaneously due to thermodynamic constraints once the sequential sao reaction channel was opened the efficiency of acetate degradation by sao was actually faster than the direct cleavage of acetate by am even though the dominant sao can result in further contributions to h2 production therefore the pressure of natural selection led to the evolution of more syntrophs and hm following the prevalence pathway of sao seems rational during the entire process in r1 3 r4 10 and r7 25 g for propionate oxidation δ g p r o p i o n a t e and butyrate oxidation δ g b u t y r a t e were in the range of 30 75 kj mol and 45 85 kj mol respectively fig 6 both of these values are lower than those obtained by li et al 2020 and qiao et al 2016 under mesophilic conditions this is rational because the operating temperature in this study is higher which would facilitate the syntrophic degradation of propionate and butyrate due to the advantages of thermodynamics and kinetics li et al 2020 regardless of the s i ratio butyrate degradation was more thermodynamically favorable and more straightforward than that of propionate because δ g b u t y r a t e is lower than δ g p r o p i o n a t e eq 4 also shows that each mole of butyrate can be converted into two moles of acetate hence decreases in the acetate concentration can accelerate butyrate degradation ketheesan and stuckey 2015 concisely although differences exist in the specific growth rate of anaerobic microorganisms that utilize acetate and butyrate the overall metabolic performance of butyrate degradation under moderate organic loadings stress can also recover from the disturbance which is similar to that of acetate propionate degradation is the most thermodynamic unfavorable process due to the high δg values with the decrease of acetate and butyrate concentration in r1 3 r4 10 and r7 25 the high level of propionate also exhibited an obvious downward degradation trend a similar concept also indicated that the rapid decrease of acetate and butyrate can be regarded as a signal for the recovery of anaerobic microorganisms that utilize propionate qiao et al 2016 δ g p r o p i o n a t e was negative and gradually decreased as the syntrophic reaction progressed however unlike butyrate which decreased significantly with a sharp decrease in h2 propionate had the slowest degradation rate and dominated for a long time during the latter period of ad with the increase in s i ratio propionate degradation became more prolonged in r4 10 which had the optimum reactor performance δ g p r o p i o n a t e was 49 67 1 79 kj mol on day 5 while in r7 25 it took at least 7 days for δ g p r o p i o n a t e to decrease from 31 97 4 68 kj mol to a similar value fig 6 this behavior is consistent with the performance of the lag phase and the slow decrease in δ g p r o p i o n a t e also confirmed that the syntrophic propionate degradation recovered more slowly from disruption as the s i ratio continued to increase unlike the performance of δ g s a o δ g p r o p i o n a t e and δ g b u t y r a t e which gradually decreased as the reaction progressed due to the massive accumulation of h2 and acetate at the early stage in r8 30 δ g p r o p i o n a t e and δ g s a o were the first to reach a positive value directly indicating the degradation of propionate and acetate by syntrophic acetogenic bacteria had become thermodynamically unfeasible although negative values were still observed for δ g b u t y r a t e these values were significantly higher than those obtained in other groups p 0 01 subsequently δ g b u t y r a t e continued to increase as acetate and h2 accumulation became more severe indicating the occurrence of syntrophic butyrate oxidation was actually more difficult in turn the slower degradation rate contributed to further butyrate accumulation fig 3 combined with the analysis on ad performance and process stability it can be concluded that under high organic loading stress the deviation of stability parameters to various degrees from the recommended threshold values merely suggested the existence of thermodynamic constraints for ad however no adverse thermodynamic effects occurred as the actual δg values for the main accumulated vfa degradation were always at a negative value indeed the stepwise increase in the s i ratio only increased the values of δ g s a o δ g p r o p i o n a t e and δ g b u t y r a t e at the early stage retarding the syntrophic oxidation process for acetate propionate and butyrate further resulting in the extension of the lag phase and the decrease in the methanogenic activity of ad fig s2 the over acidification at the early stage gradually became more severe subsequently positive values for δ g p r o p i o n a t e and δ g s a o were first observed in r8 30 indicating the syntrophic propionate and acetate oxidation reached thermodynamic equilibrium and bio reactions ceased consequently substrate degradation by hydrolytic and acidogenic bacteria to generate acetate and h2 continued until feedback inhibition occurred terminating the upstream processes and resulting in the total crash of the ad system 3 5 implication ad exposed to organic overloading usually results in decreased electricity production digester reinitialization and secondary pollution due to the massive generation of acidic digestion digestate if not handled properly monitoring specific state indicators at regular intervals can provide insights into what happens in anaerobic reactors and hence the selection of ideal state indicators and the corresponding diagnostic mode is particularly important the common practice to diagnose process stability at the industrial level is to set threshold values for related state indicators the current process status of ad is evaluated and process instability is predicted based on the degree of deviation of the threshold values wu et al 2021a however stable and continuous methane generation can also be found beyond these threshold limits due to the specific configuration of operational parameters of ad reactors and a different composition and adaptability of microbes in the inoculum therefore the diagnostic mode remains primitive and lacks universality to our knowledge this is the first study to systematically reveal the thermodynamic mechanism of key vfas degradation under increasing organic loadings and provides a new theoretical basis for its further improvement notably on day 5 in r7 25 and r8 30 similar values for ph and alkalinity were observed as well as large deviations in the state indicators from the recommended threshold values either jointly or independently based on the above however only the occurrence of severe disturbance can be confirmed it is impossible to make a diagnosis and speculate whether the ad system of interest can withstand the current organic loadings to continue functioning in contrast the performance of δ g p r o p i o n a t e and δ g s a o under increased organic loading stress demonstrated that the key metabolic process was syntrophic propionate degradation by mmc and acetate degradation by sao to be more specific the δ g p r o p i o n a t e and δ g s a o values were negative in r7 25 while both values were positive at the same time point in r8 30 combined with the analysis on commonly used state indicators it can be concluded that δ g p r o p i o n a t e and δ g s a o are better able to identify the process status in response to organic overload in addition a gradual increase of both values was also observed along with increasing organic loadings when the overall ad performance was not crashed suggesting a potential to be used as alternative early warning indicators unfortunately due to the limitation of batch tests that is the negative impact of shock loading caused by a single large dosage it might be impossible to accurately determine whether δ g p r o p i o n a t e or δ g s a o will be inhibited first research conducted in continuous mode is merited for further exploration and to confirm its actual potential applicability to provide an early warning 4 conclusion vfa accumulation became more severe as the organic loading stress increased accompanied by decreased methane yield slower methane production kinetics and even severe process instability acetate propionate and butyrate accounted for the majority of accumulated vfas in ad metagenomic analysis demonstrated that propionate and butyrate were degraded by methyl malonyl coa and the β oxidation pathway while syntrophic acetate oxidation was preferred during acetate degradation the thermodynamic disadvantage was more pronounced under high organic loadings when s i was in the range from 3 to 25 increased organic loading stress merely retarded the syntrophic oxidation of propionate butyrate and acetate resulting in the decrease of methanogenic activity and the extension of the lag phase of ad but no adverse thermodynamic effects actually occurred the key to process instability is syntrophic propionate and acetate oxidation changes in the gibbs free energy for syntrophic propionate and acetate oxidation provided a novel concept for upgrading the diagnostic mode for ad process stability author

16194,the presence of brackish saline groundwater bsg poses great harms for human health agricultural and industrial activity understanding how the major environmental features in bsg determine microbiota coalescence is crucial for groundwater monitoring optimization based on metabarcoding analysis of 242 pcr amplified samples we provided the first blueprints about distinct spatiotemporal distributions ecological drivers and assembly processes of bacterial archaeal and fungal communities in bsg obtained from new constructed wells at xiong an new area china our study demonstrated that bacterial and archaeal communities exhibited significant spatial turnovers while fungal community displayed the most obvious seasonal variation environmental filtering drove bacterial compositions more than those of archaea and fungi total dissolved solids tds one of the most critical hydrochemical factors for salinization had a stronger effect on bacterial spatiotemporal turnover than on those of the other two taxonomic groups while chemical oxygen demand codmn was more significantly associated with prokaryotic community variations bacterial and archaeal taxa dominated the metacommunity network and connected closely and tds was mostly related to archaeal subnetwork topological features suggesting a significant influence of tds on species association patterns within archaea specific functional guilds like bacterial nitrite oxidation anammox and archaeal methanogenesis were enriched in lower tds habitats while higher tds favored bacterial communities involved in dark oxidation of sulfur compounds fumarate respiration and cellulolysis finally we confirmed that bacterial and archaeal assembly processes were governed by determinism in each season and that of fungi was more regulated by stochasticity higher tds was speculated to lead bacterial assembly more deterministic and that of fungi more random together these findings provided an integrate theoretical framework

for 99 of the total volume of freshwater on earth héry et al 2014 and provides a lot of vital services to humanity griebler et al 2014 in china groundwater sustains water demands from almost 70 of the total population and 40 of agricultural irrigation sang et al 2018 however groundwater can be salinizing due to salt accumulation via evapotranspiration and or seawater intrusions han et al 2020 this situation is largely associated with recent climate variations sea level changes and groundwater over exploitation han et al 2020 groundwater salinization has become one of the most serious environmental geological issues which may pose severe harms to local human health agricultural and industrial production worland et al 2015 chen et al 2020 many european and asian countries such as spain france italy the philippines and china have suffered a lot from the groundwater salinization chen et al 2020 understanding the effect of brackish saline groundwater bsg on surrounding ecology is

pivotal participants in biogeochemical processes like carbon nitrogen and sulfur cycling and degradation of contaminants griebler et al 2014 previous studies have confirmed that groundwater microorganisms are quite sensitive to salinity changes and some taxa can be used as valuable bio indicators for monitoring salinization for example héry et al 2014 demonstrated that salinity was one of the most important factors in driving bacterial community variation in a carbonate aquifer chen et al 2019a and chen et al 2020 revealed the significant variations of groundwater bacterial communities along a salinity gradient in salt freshwater mixing zones unno et al 2015 suggested that high and low salinity groundwater differed in bacterial compositions significantly with the family parvularculaceae only observed in the high salinity samples and the phylum actinobacteria predominating in the pristine ones sang et al 2019 investigated the influences of hydrogeochemical factors on groundwater bacterial communities in the pearl river delta and found that exiguobacterium acinetobacter and sulfuricurvum were dominant in bsg however compared with numerous investigations on bacteria the ecological roles of two other independent groups archaea and fungi have been poorly understood in bsg which may not benefit the formation of complete viewpoints on microbial ecology during groundwater salinization contrasts of community responses of the three microbial groups to saline stress are thus needed an integrated theoretical framework in microbial ecology covers the community variations across time and space as well as the underlying mechanisms that generate and maintain the diversity ning et al 2019 for the time series research the community variation over the season is one of the most concerning issues chen et al 2020 for comparing the spatial turnover distance decay relationship ddr that describes the decline of community similarity with increasing geographic distance is one of the most widely accepted patterns nekola and white 1999 microbial ddrs are generally regulated by two complementary processes determinism and stochasticity wang et al 2017a jiao et al 2020 the former refers to ecological selection emphasizing the effects of abiotic factors and biotic interactions on distinct niches while the latter assumes that all species are ecologically equivalent and not associated with any environmental influence for example dispersal and drift zhou and ning 2017 the relative importance of these two processes in community assembling varies across habitat types or taxonomic groups wang et al 2017a jiao et al 2020 and can be balanced by environmental factors lei et al 2020 wu et al 2021 within our knowledge few studies have integrally compared the spatiotemporal distribution patterns and underlying driving mechanisms among the three microbial groups subject to the typical bsg characteristics to address the above issue we conducted a synchronous sampling of two adjacent aquifers with similar hydrogeological characteristics in wet and dry seasons respectively at the north china plain ncp where bsg related to evaporation

transcribed spacer its gene amplicons the objectives of this study were to a analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of the three microbial groups in bsg b compare the effects of the major hydrochemical factors e g salinity on community turnovers and potential taxa associations among the three microbial groups in bsg c elucidate the relative importance of determinism and stochasticity in community assembling and its relation with environmental features of bsg our study is of great help for policy makers to gain a complete understanding about subterranean microbial behaviors under saline stress

algorithm edgar et al 2011 uparse was utilized for operational taxonomic units otus clustering with a sequence similarity cutoff of 97 edgar 2013 otus with only one sequence were discarded the representative sequence from each otu was aligned against silva small subunit release 128 quast et al 2013 or unite nilsson et al 2019 databases for taxonomic assignments using rdp classifier wang et al 2007 to minimize the bias due to different sequencing depths each dataset was rarefied to the lowest number of clean reads across all the datasets i e 32 322 31 164 and 62 666 reads for bacteria archaea and fungi respectively 2 5 statistical analyses 2 5 1 alpha diversity analysis alpha diversity indexes such as good s coverage shannon diversity chao1 and phylogenetic diversity were calculated using mothur schloss et al 2009 meanwhile rarefaction curves based on the otu number were attained the wilcoxon rank sum tests wilcox test function in stats package of r were performed to compare the alpha diversity between two specific groups 2 5 2 beta diversity analysis community bray curtis dissimilarities among pairwise samples were computed using qiime caporaso et al 2010 and the matrices were visualized using principal coordinate analysis pcoa cmdscale function in stats analysis of similarity anosim anosim function in vegan was conducted to test the significance of microbial compositional differences between different groups the bray curtis similarity matrices in each season were plotted against the geographic distance matrix for the ddrs mantel tests mantel function in vegan were utilized to evaluate the significance of spearman s rank correlations between the bray curtis dissimilarity and geographic distance matrices the wilcoxon rank sum tests were carried out to examine the significance of differences in terms of the community dissimilarities relative abundances at phylum class and otu levels or environmental factors between two specific groups 2 5 3 effects of environmental factors on community structure the environmental euclidean distance matrix was calculated using the variables with variance inflation factors 20 chen et al 2019b the bray curtis

in vegan were further executed to disentangle the pure effects of environmental and geographic distance distance based redundancy analysis dbrda capscale function in vegan based on the bray curtis dissimilarities was performed then the envfit function was run to select the significant environmental factors to confirm the effects of the key factors on community variations the mantel tests were conducted linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse was subsequently used to identify the bacterial archaeal and fungal biomarkers associated with specific environmental characteristics lda score 2 0 segata et al 2011 2 5 4 network analysis metacommunity correlation networks consisting of all the bacterial archaeal and fungal otus were constructed using hmisc igraph and vegan packages in r to lower the network complexity pairwise spearman s correlation coefficients based on relative abundances jiao et al 2020 ma et al 2016 were calculated only between otus occurring in more than 20 of samples the robust spearman s r 0 6 and significant benjamini hochberg corrected p 0 01 correlations were retained and exported for network visualization in gephi https gephi org to examine the differences in node level topological features between distinct taxonomic groups we performed the wilcoxon rank sum tests in addition bacterial archaeal and fungal subnetworks were respectively generated from the metacommunity network by preserving otus presented in all the samples induced subgraph function in igraph subnetworks for each sample were also generated by following the procedure of ma et al 2016 network level topological features were calculated for each subnetwork to elucidate the environmental effects we then computed the spearman s and pearson s correlation coefficients between the network level topological features and environmental factors 2 5 5 classification of functional guilds we partitioned the microorganisms into particular metabolic functional groups based on faprotax database http www loucalab com archive faprotax louca et al 2016 the faprotax database maps microbial taxa derived from amplicon sequencing to more than 80 metabolic or other ecologically relevant functions using the current literature on cultured strains the spearman s correlations coefficients between environmental factors and relative abundances of all the obtained functional guilds were further calculated 2 5 6 estimating normalized stochasticity ratios to quantify the relative importance of determinism and stochasticity in bacterial archaeal and fungal community assembly processes in each season normalized stochasticity ratios nsts ning et al 2019 based on the bray curtis distance were estimated by using tnst and nst boot functions in nst package of r nst is an index within a mathematical framework that provides quantitative assessment of ecological stochasticity under different situations in which deterministic forces drive communities more similar or dissimilar than null expectation ning et al 2019 nst was developed with 50 as the boundary value between more deterministic 50 and more stochastic 50 to test the influence of environmental factors on the balance between determinism and stochasticity we divided all the samples into several groups based on specific environmental features then examined the significance of group differences of nsts 3 results 3 1 hydrochemical characteristics of brackish saline groundwater based on the standard for groundwater quality of china gb t 14848 2017 there were nine environmental factors i e tds so4 2 na f hardness fe cl mn and codmn reaching a fairly poor level iv or v in at least one sample fig 1 table s2 regarding the above factors the proportions of the poor level samples were sequentially 67 1 85 4 85 4 74 4 70 7 56 1 34 1 34 1 and 8 5 all these factors did not display significant differences between wet and dry seasons but spatially varied one to four orders of magnitude as one of the most crucial factors for bsg tds ranged widely from 93 9 to 9529 6 mg l with an average of 2315 2 and 2726 2 mg l in wet and dry seasons separately according to tds concentrations li et al 2021 41 9 23 2 and 34 9 of the wet season samples belonged to brackish 1000 3000 mg l saline 3000 mg l and fresh 1000 mg l groundwater respectively 33 3 35 9 and 30 8 of samples belonged to brackish saline and fresh groundwater in the dry season bsg was mostly present in both aquifers of the adjacent areas including longitudinal groups 3 4 5 6 and 8 where tds concentrations 3506 5 2444 9 mg l were significantly higher than those 621 4 422 4 mg l of longitudinal groups 1 2 and 7 wilcoxon rank sum test p 0 0001 fig 1 and s1 table s1 saline groundwater with very high tds concentrations 5000 mg l was found in the adjacent wells like c6 1 e6 1 f6 1 and h6 1 within longitudinal group 6 or g4 1 h4 1 and h4 2 within longitudinal group 4 fig 1 and s1 table s1 statistics of other salinization factors ca mg k and hco3 were summarized in table s3 it was observed that so4 2 1606 8 1560 2 mg l na 692 7 478 4 mg l and hco3 586 7 147 8 mg l contributed largely to groundwater salinization as 86 6 of samples reached the level iv quality based on the concentrations of either of them the piper analysis further showed that groundwater samples in both seasons were predominated by na so4 2 cl wet 60 5 dry 71 8 and na hco3 wet 27 9 dry 17 9 types while 89 0 61 0 and 28 0 of samples belonged to na so4 2 and hco3 categories respectively fig s3a the gibbs diagrams demonstrated that the chemical evolution of most groundwater samples over both seasons was governed by water rock interactions and evaporation rather than precipitation fig s3b c all these findings confirmed that bsg was widespread in the studying area and the major hydrochemical characteristics were relatively stable between wet and dry seasons 3 2 spatiotemporal distribution patterns of groundwater microbiota we obtained 16 278 bacterial 4833 archaeal and 4683 fungal otus from 242 pcr amplified samples four short out of 246 due to pcr failures the rarefaction curves for most samples tended to reach saturation fig s4 high good s coverage values were also acquired bacteria 0 953 0 987 archaea 0 991 0 999 fungi 0 9973 0 9998 table s4 this implied that the majority of microbial taxa have been well covered by the current sequencing depth comparing the alpha diversity among the three microbial groups fig s5a c we found that bacteria had a much higher shannon diversity chao1 index and phylogenetic diversity than archaea and fungi in either one season p 0 0001 suggesting that bacteria owned the richest and most diverse taxa in groundwater with salinization bacterial alpha diversity did not exhibit a significant seasonal variation archaea possessed a higher alpha diversity e g chao1 and phylogenetic diversity in the wet season than in the dry season p 0 0001 while fungi possessed a higher alpha diversity e g shannon diversity and chao1 in the dry season than in the wet season p 0 0001 for the beta diversity fig s5d both bacteria and archaea had significantly higher bray curtis dissimilarities than fungi p 0 0001 indicating that groundwater prokaryotic compositions were much more variable than the fungal group within either one season the wet season harbored a higher community dissimilarity in fungi p 0 0001 and a lower community dissimilarity in archaea than the dry season p 0 01 while no significant seasonal difference was observed for that of bacteria the pcoa and anosim statistics were employed to illustrate the microbial compositional differences between wet and dry seasons the results demonstrated that the seasonal variation of fungal composition r anosim 0 359 p 0 0001 was much stronger than those of bacteria r anosim 0 123 p 0 0002 and archaea r anosim 0 035 p 0 0346 fig 2 a this could be further evidenced by more abundant season sensitive otus found in fungi 59 0 than in bacteria or archaea 24 0 fig 2b at the phylum level both ascomycota 58 6 and basidiomycota 19 6 dominated the fungal community showing significant preferences to wet 62 5 and dry 27 6 seasons respectively p 0 05 fig 2c proteobacteria 37 1 chloroflexi 10 8 nitrospirae 7 5 parcubacteria 7 4 and bacteroidetes 5 7 were the top five abundant phyla in the bacterial community and proteobacteria and nitrospirae had evident preferences to wet 42 9 and dry 10 7 seasons separately p 0 01 fig 2c archaea were predominated by thaumarchaeota 23 0 marine benthic group e 21 3 aenigmarchaeota 18 5 woesearchaeota 10 7 and euryarchaeota 5 6 and all the dominant phyla displayed no significant seasonal sensitivity in the abundances p 0 05 fig 2c for the major classes we found much more abundant season sensitive classes in fungi 72 7 than in bacteria 32 3 and archaea 7 4 fig s6 we used the ddrs to estimate the spatial variations of groundwater microbial compositions both bacterial and archaeal communities exhibited significant ddrs during wet and dry seasons mantel spearman s r 0 138 0 409 p 0 05 however the ddrs of fungal community were insignificant mantel r 0 069 0 097 p 0 10 fig 3 a consistent with the above findings the pcoa and anosim statistics confirmed that bacterial and archaeal compositions differed very significantly among distinct latitudinal or longitudinal sample groups in both seasons maximum r anosim 0 358 0 339 0 435 or 0 308 p 0 0001 while the latitudinal and longitudinal differentiations of fungal community were not significant in the wet season r anosim 0 049 0 081 p 0 05 and less pronounced in the dry season maximum r anosim 0 132 p 0 05 fig 3b c overall the three microbial groups in groundwater with salinization presented different temporal or spatial distribution characteristics on alpha and beta diversity bacterial and archaeal compositions had obvious spatial variations while that of fungi was more susceptible to season 3 3 environmental influences on microbial community turnovers correlation network and functional guilds we then investigated how environmental factors shaped the community turnovers of the three microbial groups in groundwater with salinization within all the samples or either one season we observed more significant and stronger correlations between the environmental distance and community bray curtis dissimilarities in bacteria mantel r 0 249 0 496 p 0 001 than in archaea mantel r 0 128 0 293 p 0 01 except the wet season and fungi mantel r 0 086 0 142 p 0 05 fig 4 a the partial mantel tests demonstrated that bacterial compositions were more purely influenced by environmental distance than geographic distance during both seasons while the opposite trends were suggested for archaea table s5 compared with bacteria archaeal community was less purely constrained by environmental distance and that of fungi was much less associated with both environmental and geographic distances table s5 thus environmental filtering as a deterministic process drove the bacterial community more than those of archaea and fungi the envfit analysis based on the dbrda was further conducted to select the significant environmental factors fig 4b the bacterial spatiotemporal turnover was mostly contributed by codmn r 2 0 477 na r 2 0 464 tds r 2 0 405 and so4 2 r 2 0 391 p 0 0001 the bacterial spatial differentiation in the wet season was primarily related to codmn r 2 0 633 p 0 0001 while that in the dry season was primarily associated with na r 2 0 656 cl r 2 0 613 tds r 2 0 604 and so4 2 r 2 0 552 p 0 0001 for archaea codmn was the most important factor in shaping the overall spatiotemporal heterogeneity or spatial turnover in any seasons r 2 0 360 0 609 p 0 001 for fungi the spatiotemporal turnover was mainly driven by toc 5 4 2 2 mg l r 2 0 503 temperature 15 0 1 1 c r 2 0 414 and ph 7 8 0 4 r 2 0 402 p 0 0001 the major ecological drivers for fungal community variations were quite different from those for bacteria and archaea notably the salinization related factors tds so4 2 na cl ca and mg could have more pronounced influences on the bacterial spatiotemporal turnover r 2 0 257 0 464 p 0 001 rather than those of archaea r 2 0 128 0 287 p 0 01 and fungi r 2 0 093 0 153 p 0 01 and codmn was more significantly associated with prokaryotic community variations r 2 0 360 0 633 p 0 001 similarly mantel tests indicated that tds was more correlated with community variation in bacteria r 0 219 0 388 p 0 0001 0 0014 instead of in archaea r 0 091 0 151 p 0 006 0 129 and fungi r 0 014 0 135 p 0 05 across both seasons or in either one season while codmn was merely significantly related to bacterial and archaeal variations r 0 174 0 416 p 0 0001 0 0211 table s6 the lefse was applied to identify the microbial biomarkers associated with tds and codmn because both of them were the concerning environmental variables fig 1 table s2 that had significant effects on the community turnovers the prokaryotic phyla firmicutes aminicenantes marinimicrobia sar406 clade and wsa2 and classes flavobacteriia clostridia anaerolineae bacteroidetes vc2 1 bac22 and 20a 9 were the typical bacterial or archaeal bio indicators for relatively high tds groundwater 1000 10 000 mg l where their mean abundances were 1 25 28 fold higher than those in the low tds 1000 mg l fig 5 a pseudomonas acinetobacter lutibacter and ca kuenenia were the major genera tolerating high tds fig s7 the prokaryotic phyla chloroflexi aenigmarchaeota and parvarchaeota and classes dehalococcoidia sar202 clade deep sea euryarchaeotic group and marine benthic group a preferred relatively high codmn groundwater 2 8 mg l where the mean abundances were 2 4 6 3 fold higher than those of the low codmn 2 mg l fig 5b for prokaryotic genera syntrophus and desulfitibacter showed the most significant preferences to the high codmn conditions fig s8 in fungi we found that the class leotiomycetes and genera rhodotorula naganishia epicoccum didymella and pseudeurotium flourished in high tds or codmn groundwater even if tds and codmn were not the main ecological drivers for the whole community to explore association patterns among microbial taxa subject to groundwater salinization we inferred metacommunity networks based on spearman correlations r 0 6 bacterial and archaeal otus dominated the overall wet and dry networks 91 5 93 7 of nodes and connected closely inter domain 15 5 21 8 of edges intra domain 76 1 82 6 of edges fig 6 a fig s9a c they had similar node level topological features i e node degree betweenness centrality and closeness centrality which were far higher than those of fungi p 0 0001 in all the networks fig 6b fig s9b d these results indicated that prokaryotic taxa shared similar niches and more often resided in central positions of the network archaea possessed more inter domain connections with bacteria than the intra domain connections aenigmarchaeota mostly connected with bacterial abundant phyla parcubacteria chloroflexi and omnitrophica while thaumarchaeota had the most connections with chloroflexi and proteobacteria in the overall network fig s10 we subsequently generated bacterial archaeal and fungal subnetworks and linked a series of network level topological characteristics to the hydrochemical factors of groundwater we found that codmn was significantly and strongly correlated with the most topological features of the bacterial subnetwork spearman s r 0 260 0 475 or 0 240 0 577 p 0 01 while codmn tds so4 2 na cl ca and mg were significantly and strongly related to the most topological features of the archaeal subnetwork spearman s r 0 157 0 652 or 0 340 0 749 p 0 01 fig 6c these results could be further consolidated by the linear regression analysis based on pearson s correlations fig s11 and s12 temperature toc ph orp and hco3 were only significantly and strongly associated with topological features of the fungal subnetwork spearman s r 0 312 0 627 or 0 336 0 597 p 0 01 fig 6c network properties symbolize the potential ecological associations in a community ma et al 2016 and tds was inclined to have a significant influence on such associations within archaea rather than bacteria and fungi in bsg we elucidated how the environmental variables determined the microbial functional guilds in groundwater fig 7 tds and its major components so4 2 na cl ca mg or k were strongly and negatively correlated with the abundances of guilds like bacterial nitrification nitrite oxidation and respiration nitrogen respiration anammox and archaeal methanogenesis tds spearman s r 0 330 0 428 p 0 05 but positively associated with the abundances of bacterial dark oxidation of sulfur compounds fumarate respiration and cellulolysis tds spearman s r 0 221 0 361 p 0 01 which suggested different responses to salinization among these functional communities consistent with the above results two nitrite oxidizers nitrospira and ca nitrotoga one abundant anammox bacteria ca brocadia and one typical methanogen methanobacterium were identified as the biomarkers for lower tds groundwater fig s7 the abundances of nitrite oxidation respiration and anammox were also negatively related to toc codmn or c n spearman s r 0 341 0 502 p 0 05 the abundance of archaeal ammonia oxidation was strongly and negatively correlated with codmn spearman s r 0 607 p 0 05 two abundant ammonia oxidizing archaea ca nitrosoarchaeum and ca nitrososphaera were identified as the biomarkers of lower codmn groundwater fig s8 which provided a further evidence for the above result temperature ph toc fe or k were positively correlated with the abundances of bacterial guilds for chemoheterotrophy fermentation animal parasites or symbionts human pathogens nitrate reduction and respiration phototrophy dark hydrogen oxidation denitrification and chitinolysis implying the preferences to alkaline or organics rich environments 3 4 relative importance of determinism and stochasticity in governing community assembly processes to quantify the relative contributions of determinism and stochasticity to the observed spatiotemporal patterns we calculated the nsts based on the bray curtis distance during wet and dry seasons both bacterial and archaeal communities were governed by deterministic processes mean nsts 25 3 28 7 while the fungal community was more regulated by stochasticity mean nsts 52 5 52 9 fig 8 a this indicated that the major assembly processes of prokaryotic and fungal communities differed largely in groundwater with salinization besides tds or codmn might influence the balance between determinism and stochasticity bacterial nsts were significantly higher in low tds groundwater average 37 1 than in the brackish saline average 27 0 p 0 01 while fungal nsts displayed the opposite trend i e average 35 9 and 50 1 separately for the low tds and brackish saline groups p 0 05 fig 8b archaeal nsts were significantly higher in high codmn groundwater average 45 4 than in the low codmn average 28 9 p 0 05 fig 8c higher tds putatively led bacterial assembly more deterministic and that of fungi a bit more random and higher codmn might lead archaeal assembly less deterministic in groundwater 4 discussion groundwater salinization has become one of the most serious problems in the studying region and tds concentrations in many sites were even equal to those of coastal areas sang et al 2018 2019 chen et al 2020 a large cone of groundwater depression was also formed in this region zhang and li 2014 which might aggravate salinization the dominant type na so4 2 cl was different from those of coastal regions na cl unno et al 2015 sang et al 2018 but similar with that in an inland area li et al 2016 so4 2 contributed the most to groundwater salinity and it might derive from rock weathering or anthropogenic contamination e g sewage lagoon li et al 2011 2021 evaporation was another non negligible factor affecting the groundwater hydrochemistry which could facilitate the formation of so4 2 type groundwater in alluvial plains like the ncp li et al 2021 atmospheric precipitation had little effects on the chemical evolution in groundwater which was one possible reason for the insignificant seasonal variations of salinization factors groundwater salinization was persistent across wet and dry seasons and its effect on surrounding ecology should be paid attention we obtained the first different spatiotemporal distributions and underlying driving mechanisms among bacterial archaeal and fungal communities in bsg which moved forward compared to previous studies focusing on either one season or microbial domain héry et al 2014 unno et al 2015 sang et al 2018 2019 chen et al 2020 the three life domains differ essentially in genomic proteomic and evolutionary characteristics karlin et al 2002 contributing to their unique biogeography the strengths of ddrs were associated with the relative roles of ecological processes like selection dispersal and drift hanson et al 2012 both correlation and partial mantel analysis suggested that environmental selection rather than geographic distance had a dominant role in driving bacterial spatial turnovers selection represents the differences of relative adaptations to environmental stress among taxa chesson 2000 which differentiates microbial compositions among sites to generate significant ddrs highly diverse bacteria are likely to harbor endemic taxa that are restricted to a particular environment with little overlap of taxa among different habitats hanson et al 2012 for archaea the pure effects of distance on spatial turnovers were stronger than those from selection considering the dominance of determinism this might be ascribed to great roles of unmeasured abiotic biotic factors in giving rise to the significant ddrs rather than those inherent stochastic process drift and dispersal limitation wang et al 2017a zhou and ning 2017 different from prokaryotes fungal compositions showed weak ddrs with less pure environmental or distance effects selection and drift increase the strength of ddrs while dispersal counteracts it hanson et al 2012 we speculated that fungal spatial homogenization was related to the dispersal process tds and codmn were the two most important factors contributing to the significant prokaryotic ddrs tds and its major components had stronger effects on bacterial spatiotemporal turnover than those of the other two taxonomic groups more abundant bacterial phyla or classes were identified as the tds related biomarkers fig 5a gupta et al 2001 and mani et al 2020 suggested that bacteria were more sensitive to salinity than archaea or fungi and the latter two could withstand a wider salinity gradient in aquatic ecosystems which was consistent with our findings the identified dominant fungus cladosporium 12 2 and simplicillium 11 1 of this study together with genera belonging to ascomycota and basidiomycota were reported to survive in other saline environments min et al 2014 gonçalves et al 2017 bouzouina et al 2021 salt tolerant fungi have evolved with diverse special adaptive mechanisms musa et al 2018 these findings offered evidences for the overall lower saline sensitivity of fungi codmn reflects the contents of reducing substances we observed a weak and positive correlation between the concentrations of codmn and toc pearson s adjusted r 2 0 052 p 0 05 this implied that codmn covered not only organics but also inorganic reductants e g sulfur compounds in so4 2 type groundwater li et al 2011 higher codmn had a great selection on genera syntrophus and desulfitibacter fig s8 which can ferment organics and reduce sulfite respectively elshahed and mcinerney 2001 nielsen et al 2006 more abundant prokaryotic phyla or classes were also identified as the codmn related biomarkers compared to those of fungi fig 5b dehalococcoidia as a major class of phylum chloroflexi growing through organohalide respiration wasmund et al 2014 provided a good indication for higher codmn groundwater bacteria and archaea are the dominant participants to drive the redox pathways of both organics and inorganics and form metabolic handoffs within cohorts anantharaman et al 2016 mehrshad et al 2021 the co existed pattern suggested that aenigmarchaeota benefited from such handoffs with chloroflexi and lived with high codmn for another archaeal biomarker parvarchaeota in this study it was also abundant in high cod hot springs chan et al 2017 from a global viewpoint different spatiotemporal dynamics between prokaryotic and fungal communities in bsg could be resulted by distinct environmental drivers and biotic associations bacteria and archaea prevailed in the metacommunity networks and connected positively which supported their similar spatiotemporal distribution patterns as expected while prokaryotes were sensitive to salinity and codmn such compact relationships might confer prokaryotic clusters resilience in the face of environmental perturbation anantharaman et al 2016 they could also benefit from the syntrophism based on different substrates schink and stams 2006 we noted that the dpann phylum aenigmarchaeota dominated the archaeal subnetwork 19 1 of nodes and tended to co occur with bacterial taxa e g chloroflexi 29 3 of inter domain edges fig s10 most dpann archaea have limited genetic capabilities and lack biosynthetic pathways thus they must depend on the symbiotic interactions for obtaining biomolecules baker et al 2020 we also noted significant relationships between tds and archaeal subnetwork topological features instead of those of bacteria which was rarely reported in previous studies thaumarchaeota contributed to a large number of nodes 17 7 and intra inter phylum connections 20 4 and played a critical role in the subnetwork fig 6a fig s10 high tds significantly inhibited the niches of the major taxa e g soil crenarchaeotic group and marine group i of thaumarchaeota fig 5a which could bring about the network topological changes the edge and node numbers modularity and average node degree were all negatively associated with tds fig 6c fig s12 indicating that archaeal taxa were less co existed and more competitive jiao et al 2020 in higher tds groundwater whereas for bacteria the mostly affected phyla e g planctomycetes and nitrospirae by tds played relatively minor roles in the subnetwork thus the tds induced network topological variations were insignificant this implied that the variation of bacterial community composition and network pattern was asynchronous and not necessarily correlated the network based analysis demonstrated different response strengths of species association patterns within bacteria and archaea to tds variations and gained a better understanding in maintaining groundwater ecosystem stability microbial functional guilds related to biogeochemical carbon nitrogen and sulfur cycling responded differently to tds our sequencing data and in situ measurements li et al 2021 indicated inhibitory effects of high salinity on methanogen abundances and activity which was demonstrated in other lab scale studies wang et al 2017b most methanogens are hydrogenotrophs liu and whitman 2008 and they exhibit a low resistance to salinity wang et al 2017b high so4 2 concentration in tds could promote the activity of sulfate reducing microorganisms that compete with methanogens for the electron donor h2 and decline the methane emission li et al 2021 nitrite oxidation and anammox as the major nitrogen functional guilds were also restrained in higher tds environments which was in line with a few experimental studies jeong et al 2018 lin et al 2021 we found no inhibition of higher tds on the abundance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria fig 7 that were reported to be more tolerant to salinity than nitrite oxidizing bacteria jeong et al 2018 it should be noted that varying salt stress and compositions may bring different inhibition levels to freshwater anammox lin et al 2021 as anammox bacteria ca brocadia were reported to contribute largely to the nitrogen loss and no3 n removal in aquifer ecosystems across the world wang et al 2020 we should pay more attention to the effect of groundwater salinization on the subterranean nitrogen load bacterial dark oxidation of sulfur compounds fumarate respiration and cellulolysis were more enriched in higher tds groundwater chemotrophic sulfur oxidizing bacteria are a critical group responsible for the dark oxidation of reduced sulfur and some taxa are extremely or moderately halophilic sorokin et al 2013 fumarate inside their cells could serve as the terminal electron acceptor for the sulfur oxidation lu et al 2018 no significant relations were found between so4 2 and sulfate sulfite or sulfur respiration fig 7 suggesting complex niches within these guilds although these findings are interesting the functional profiles predicted from 16s rrna gene sequencing data are restricted to the available reference genomes in the database wemheuer et al 2020 further utilization of metagenomic approaches is recommended to confirm the effect of salinity on metabolic potentials a quantitative mathematical model based on the nsts demonstrated that determinism and stochasticity governed prokaryotic and fungal community assembling respectively the significant ddrs for prokaryotic communities were attributed to the dominance of determinism which could be underlaid by strong environmental filtering e g bacteria and biotic interactions e g archaea zhou and ning 2017 due to the lower sensitivity to tds or codmn fungal taxa were less constrained by selection less mutually connected and more ecologically equivalent in each season a larger proportion of fungal taxa could be salt resistant and keep active states in saline environments bouzouina et al 2021 they tended to disperse through a wide salinity gradient and displayed the insignificant ddrs although some environmental factors were obviously associated with the fungal turnover mantel tests showed that the overall effect was fairly weak fig 4a table s5 planktonic fungi in a subtropical river were also shaped by stochasticity with a high dispersal rate chen et al 2019b both surface and subterranean aquatic fungi could display a good adaptation to environmental disturbance intriguingly we suggested that higher tds might drive bacterial and fungal community assembling more deterministic and random separately and higher codmn might lead that of archaea less deterministic determinism makes the community structure and functions predictable and stochasticity makes them uncertain zhou and ning 2017 the increasing salinization could make bacterial ecological patterns much easier to be predicted it has been widely acceptable to employ artificial intelligence approaches like neural networks to forecast bacterial assemblages based on environmental parameters and biotic interactions larsen et al 2012 in this case our study may provide crucial supports for such predictive models that can be generalized to other similar environments which is valuable to assist bacterial ecology monitoring however it should be noted that archaeal and fungal community assembling was apt to disorder in higher tds or codmn groundwater these two factors also altered the compositions of prokaryotes that involve in the biogeochemical cycling in views of microbial diversity preservation and ecosystem stabilization appropriate regulation and in situ remediation of tds and codmn in groundwater are particularly needed while this study has gained a comprehensive knowledge about microbial diversity and structure in bsg based on high throughput sequencing with statistical analysis further cultivation based experiments are desirable to understand physiological characteristics and biotic direct or indirect associations carr et al 2019 which helps obtain deeper insights into microbial behaviors during groundwater salinization 5 conclusions this study gained the first comprehensive insights into different spatiotemporal dynamics ecological drivers and assembly processes of bacterial archaeal and fungal communities in groundwater with salinization tds concentration up to 9529 6 mg l we demonstrated significant spatial differentiations for prokaryotic communities and the most evident seasonal variation for fungal community environmental filtering drove bacterial compositions rather than those of archaea and fungi specifically tds had a more significant influence on bacterial spatiotemporal turnover than on those of the other two taxonomic groups and codmn mainly affected the prokaryotic community variations although massive bacterial and archaeal taxa dominated the network and had close relationships tds mostly affected potential species associations within archaea lower tds groundwater favored particular functional guilds like bacterial nitrite oxidation anammox and archaeal methanogenesis while bacterial dark oxidation of sulfur compounds fumarate respiration and cellulolysis were enriched in the higher tds lastly we confirmed that prokaryotic community assembling was governed by determinism and fungi assembling was more regulated by stochasticity higher tds might lead bacterial assembly more deterministic and that of fungi more random these results highlighted the unique responses of the three microbial domains

16194,the presence of brackish saline groundwater bsg poses great harms for human health agricultural and industrial activity understanding how the major environmental features in bsg determine microbiota coalescence is crucial for groundwater monitoring optimization based on metabarcoding analysis of 242 pcr amplified samples we provided the first blueprints about distinct spatiotemporal distributions ecological drivers and assembly processes of bacterial archaeal and fungal communities in bsg obtained from new constructed wells at xiong an new area china our study demonstrated that bacterial and archaeal communities exhibited significant spatial turnovers while fungal community displayed the most obvious seasonal variation environmental filtering drove bacterial compositions more than those of archaea and fungi total dissolved solids tds one of the most critical hydrochemical factors for salinization had a stronger effect on bacterial spatiotemporal turnover than on those of the other two taxonomic groups while chemical oxygen demand codmn was more significantly associated with prokaryotic community variations bacterial and archaeal taxa dominated the metacommunity network and connected closely and tds was mostly related to archaeal subnetwork topological features suggesting a significant influence of tds on species association patterns within archaea specific functional guilds like bacterial nitrite oxidation anammox and archaeal methanogenesis were enriched in lower tds habitats while higher tds favored bacterial communities involved in dark oxidation of sulfur compounds fumarate respiration and cellulolysis finally we confirmed that bacterial and archaeal assembly processes were governed by determinism in each season and that of fungi was more regulated by stochasticity higher tds was speculated to lead bacterial assembly more deterministic and that of fungi more random together these findings provided an integrate theoretical framework about the unique responses of the three life domains to brackish saline stress and had important implications for microbial ecological prediction in groundwater graphical abstract image graphical

for 99 of the total volume of freshwater on earth héry et al 2014 and provides a lot of vital services to humanity griebler et al 2014 in china groundwater sustains water demands from almost 70 of the total population and 40 of agricultural irrigation sang et al 2018 however groundwater can be salinizing due to salt accumulation via evapotranspiration and or seawater intrusions han et al 2020 this situation is largely associated with recent climate variations sea level changes and groundwater over exploitation han et al 2020 groundwater salinization has become one of the most serious environmental geological issues which may pose severe harms to local human health agricultural and industrial production worland et al 2015 chen et al 2020 many european and asian countries such as spain france italy the philippines and china have suffered a lot from the groundwater salinization chen et al 2020 understanding the effect of brackish saline groundwater bsg on surrounding ecology is of great help for optimization of groundwater monitoring strategies diversified microbes represented by bacteria archaea and fungi colonize groundwater ecosystems griebler et al 2014 they are the pivotal participants in biogeochemical processes like carbon nitrogen and sulfur cycling and degradation of contaminants griebler et al 2014 previous studies have confirmed that groundwater microorganisms are quite sensitive to salinity changes and some taxa can be used as valuable bio indicators for monitoring salinization for example héry et al 2014 demonstrated that salinity was one of the most important factors in driving bacterial community variation in a carbonate aquifer chen et al 2019a and chen et al 2020 revealed the significant variations of groundwater bacterial communities along a salinity gradient in salt freshwater mixing zones unno et al 2015 suggested that high and low salinity groundwater differed in bacterial compositions significantly with the family parvularculaceae only observed in the high salinity samples and the phylum actinobacteria predominating in the pristine ones sang et al 2019 investigated the influences of hydrogeochemical factors on groundwater bacterial communities in the pearl river delta and found that exiguobacterium acinetobacter and sulfuricurvum were dominant in bsg however compared with numerous investigations on bacteria the ecological roles of two other independent groups archaea and fungi have been poorly understood in bsg which may not benefit the formation of complete viewpoints on microbial ecology during groundwater salinization contrasts of community responses of the three microbial groups to saline stress are thus needed an integrated theoretical framework in microbial ecology covers the community variations across time and space as well as the underlying mechanisms that generate and maintain the diversity ning et al 2019 for the time series research the community variation over the season is one of the most concerning issues chen et al 2020 for comparing the spatial turnover distance decay relationship ddr that describes the decline of community similarity with increasing geographic distance is one of the most widely accepted patterns nekola and white 1999 microbial ddrs are generally regulated by two complementary processes determinism and stochasticity wang et al 2017a jiao et al 2020 the former refers to ecological selection emphasizing the effects of abiotic factors and biotic interactions on distinct niches while the latter assumes that all species are ecologically equivalent and not associated with any environmental influence for example dispersal and drift zhou and ning 2017 the relative importance of these two processes in community assembling varies across habitat types or taxonomic groups wang et al 2017a jiao et al 2020 and can be balanced by environmental factors lei et al 2020 wu et al 2021 within our knowledge few studies have integrally compared the spatiotemporal distribution patterns and underlying driving mechanisms among the three microbial groups subject to the typical bsg characteristics to address the above issue we conducted a synchronous sampling of two adjacent aquifers with similar hydrogeological characteristics in wet and dry seasons respectively at the north china plain ncp where bsg related to evaporation transgression over exploitation or pollution is widely existed han et al 2020 microbial communities were obtained by sequencing bacterial archaeal 16s ribosomal rna rrna and fungal internal transcribed spacer its gene amplicons the objectives of this study were to a analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of the three microbial groups in bsg b compare the effects of the major hydrochemical factors e g salinity on community turnovers and potential taxa associations among the three microbial groups in bsg c elucidate the relative importance of determinism and stochasticity in community assembling and its relation with environmental features of bsg our study is of great help for policy makers to gain a complete understanding about subterranean microbial behaviors under saline stress and has important guidance for groundwater monitoring and management 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection the ncp possesses one of the largest groundwater ecosystems in the world han et al 2020 which sustains agricultural industrial and domestic water demands from more than 24 of chinese population based on a priori investigation 35 sampling sites were established almost parallelly and perpendicularly along the tanghe river channel and sewage lagoon the upstream of baiyangdian lake at xiong an new area fig s1 table s1 in june wet season and december dry season 2019 we collected a total of 82 phreatic water samples from the first two aquifer groups fig s2 through newly constructed wells these wells were particular for groundwater monitoring under national standards with protecting and sealing devices at wellheads to meet the need of sampling in different seasons the first aquifer mainly consists of fine sand with an average hydraulic conductivity of 5 4 10 3 cm s

amplicon were merged using flash magoč et al 2011 and quality controlled using fastp chen et al 2018 detailed criteria referred to liu et al 2018 chimeras were identified and removed using uchime algorithm edgar et al 2011 uparse was utilized for operational taxonomic units otus clustering with a sequence similarity cutoff of 97 edgar 2013 otus with only one sequence were discarded the representative sequence from each otu was aligned against silva small subunit release 128 quast et al 2013 or unite nilsson et al 2019 databases for taxonomic assignments using rdp classifier wang et al 2007 to minimize the bias due to different sequencing depths each dataset was rarefied to the lowest number of clean reads across all the datasets i e 32 322 31 164 and 62 666 reads for bacteria archaea and fungi respectively 2 5 statistical analyses 2 5 1 alpha diversity analysis alpha diversity indexes such as good s coverage shannon diversity chao1 and phylogenetic diversity were calculated using mothur schloss et al 2009 meanwhile rarefaction curves based on the otu number were attained the wilcoxon rank sum tests wilcox test function in stats package of r were performed to compare the alpha diversity between two specific groups 2 5 2 beta diversity analysis community bray curtis dissimilarities among pairwise samples were computed using qiime caporaso et al 2010 and the matrices were visualized using principal coordinate analysis pcoa cmdscale function in stats analysis of similarity anosim anosim function in vegan was conducted to test the significance of microbial compositional differences between different groups the bray curtis similarity matrices in each season were plotted against the geographic distance matrix for the ddrs mantel tests mantel function in vegan were utilized to evaluate the significance of spearman s rank correlations between the bray curtis dissimilarity and geographic distance matrices the wilcoxon rank sum tests were carried out to examine the significance of differences in terms of the community dissimilarities relative abundances at phylum class and otu levels or environmental factors between two specific groups 2 5 3 effects of environmental factors on community structure the environmental euclidean distance matrix was calculated using the variables with variance inflation factors 20 chen et al 2019b the bray curtis dissimilarity matrices were plotted against the environmental distance matrix with mantel tests revealing the significance of their spearman s correlations partial mantel tests mantel partial function in vegan were further executed to disentangle the pure effects of environmental and geographic distance distance based redundancy analysis dbrda capscale function in vegan based on the bray curtis dissimilarities was performed then the envfit function was run to select the significant environmental factors to confirm the effects of the key factors on community variations the mantel tests were conducted linear discriminant analysis lda effect size lefse was subsequently used to identify the bacterial archaeal and fungal biomarkers associated with specific environmental characteristics lda score 2 0 segata et al 2011 2 5 4 network analysis metacommunity correlation networks consisting of all the bacterial archaeal and fungal otus were constructed using hmisc igraph and vegan packages in r to lower the network complexity pairwise spearman s correlation coefficients based on relative abundances jiao et al 2020 ma et al 2016 were calculated only between otus occurring in more than 20 of samples the robust spearman s r 0 6 and significant benjamini hochberg corrected p 0 01 correlations were retained and exported for network visualization in gephi https gephi org to examine the differences in node level topological features between distinct taxonomic groups we performed the wilcoxon rank sum tests in addition bacterial archaeal and fungal subnetworks were respectively generated from the metacommunity network by preserving otus presented in all the samples induced subgraph function in igraph subnetworks for each sample were also generated by following the procedure of ma et al 2016 network level topological features were calculated for each subnetwork to elucidate the environmental effects we then computed the spearman s and pearson s correlation coefficients between the network level topological features and environmental factors 2 5 5 classification of functional guilds we partitioned the microorganisms into particular metabolic functional groups based on faprotax database http www loucalab com archive faprotax louca et al 2016 the faprotax database maps microbial taxa derived from amplicon sequencing to more than 80 metabolic or other ecologically relevant functions using the current literature on cultured strains the spearman s correlations coefficients between environmental factors and relative abundances of all the obtained functional guilds were further calculated 2 5 6 estimating normalized stochasticity ratios to quantify the relative importance of determinism and stochasticity in bacterial archaeal and fungal community assembly processes in each season normalized stochasticity ratios nsts ning et al 2019 based on the bray curtis distance were estimated by using tnst and nst boot functions in nst package of r nst is an index within a mathematical framework that provides quantitative assessment of ecological stochasticity under different situations in which deterministic forces drive communities more similar or dissimilar than null expectation ning et al 2019 nst was developed with 50 as the boundary value between more deterministic 50 and more stochastic 50 to test the influence of environmental factors on the balance between determinism and stochasticity we divided all the samples into several groups based on specific environmental features then examined the significance of group differences of nsts 3 results 3 1 hydrochemical characteristics of brackish saline groundwater based on the standard for groundwater quality of china gb t 14848 2017 there were nine environmental factors i e tds so4 2 na f hardness fe cl mn and codmn reaching a fairly poor level iv or v in at least one sample fig 1 table s2 regarding the above factors the proportions of the poor level samples were sequentially 67 1 85 4 85 4 74 4 70 7 56 1 34 1 34 1 and 8 5 all these factors did not display significant differences between wet and dry seasons but spatially varied one to four orders of magnitude as one of the most crucial factors for bsg tds ranged widely from 93 9 to 9529 6 mg l with an average of 2315 2 and 2726 2 mg l in wet and dry seasons separately according to tds concentrations li et al 2021 41 9 23 2 and 34 9 of the wet season samples belonged to brackish 1000 3000 mg l saline 3000 mg l and fresh 1000 mg l groundwater respectively 33 3 35 9 and 30 8 of samples belonged to brackish saline and fresh groundwater in the dry season bsg was mostly present in both aquifers of the adjacent areas including longitudinal groups 3 4 5 6 and 8 where tds concentrations 3506 5 2444 9 mg l were significantly higher than those 621 4 422 4 mg l of longitudinal groups 1 2 and 7 wilcoxon rank sum test p 0 0001 fig 1 and s1 table s1 saline groundwater with very high tds concentrations 5000 mg l was found in the adjacent wells like c6 1 e6 1 f6 1 and h6 1 within longitudinal group 6 or g4 1 h4 1 and h4 2 within longitudinal group 4 fig 1 and s1 table s1 statistics of other salinization factors ca mg k and hco3 were summarized in table s3 it was observed that so4 2 1606 8 1560 2 mg l na 692 7 478 4 mg l and hco3 586 7 147 8 mg l contributed largely to groundwater salinization as 86 6 of samples reached the level iv quality based on the concentrations of either of them the piper analysis further showed that groundwater samples in both seasons were predominated by na so4 2 cl wet 60 5 dry 71 8 and na hco3 wet 27 9 dry 17 9 types while 89 0 61 0 and 28 0 of samples belonged to na so4 2 and hco3 categories respectively fig s3a the gibbs diagrams demonstrated that the chemical evolution of most groundwater samples over both seasons was governed by water rock interactions and evaporation rather than precipitation fig s3b c all these findings confirmed that bsg was widespread in the studying area and the major hydrochemical characteristics were relatively stable between wet and dry seasons 3 2 spatiotemporal distribution patterns of groundwater microbiota we obtained 16 278 bacterial 4833 archaeal and 4683 fungal otus from 242 pcr amplified samples four short out of 246 due to pcr failures the rarefaction curves for most samples tended to reach saturation fig s4 high good s coverage values were also acquired bacteria 0 953 0 987 archaea 0 991 0 999 fungi 0 9973 0 9998 table s4 this implied that the majority of microbial taxa have been well covered by the current sequencing depth comparing the alpha diversity among the three microbial groups fig s5a c we found that bacteria had a much higher shannon diversity chao1 index and phylogenetic diversity than archaea and fungi in either one season p 0 0001 suggesting that bacteria owned the richest and most diverse taxa in groundwater with salinization bacterial alpha diversity did not exhibit a significant seasonal variation archaea possessed a higher alpha diversity e g chao1 and phylogenetic diversity in the wet season than in the dry season p 0 0001 while fungi possessed a higher alpha diversity e g shannon diversity and chao1 in the dry season than in the wet season p 0 0001 for the beta diversity fig s5d both bacteria and archaea had significantly higher bray curtis dissimilarities than fungi p 0 0001 indicating that groundwater prokaryotic compositions were much more variable than the fungal group within either one season the wet season harbored a higher community dissimilarity in fungi p 0 0001 and a lower community dissimilarity in archaea than the dry season p 0 01 while no significant seasonal difference was observed for that of bacteria the pcoa and anosim statistics were employed to illustrate the microbial compositional differences between wet and dry seasons the results demonstrated that the seasonal variation of fungal composition r anosim 0 359 p 0 0001 was much stronger than those of bacteria r anosim 0 123 p 0 0002 and archaea r anosim 0 035 p 0 0346 fig 2 a this could be further evidenced by more abundant season sensitive otus found in fungi 59 0 than in bacteria or archaea 24 0 fig 2b at the phylum level both ascomycota 58 6 and basidiomycota 19 6 dominated the fungal community showing significant preferences to wet 62 5 and dry 27 6 seasons respectively p 0 05 fig 2c proteobacteria 37 1 chloroflexi 10 8 nitrospirae 7 5 parcubacteria 7 4 and bacteroidetes 5 7 were the top five abundant phyla in the bacterial community and proteobacteria and nitrospirae had evident preferences to wet 42 9 and dry 10 7 seasons separately p 0 01 fig 2c archaea were predominated by thaumarchaeota 23 0 marine benthic group e 21 3 aenigmarchaeota 18 5 woesearchaeota 10 7 and euryarchaeota 5 6 and all the dominant phyla displayed no significant seasonal sensitivity in the abundances p 0 05 fig 2c for the major classes we found much more abundant season sensitive classes in fungi 72 7 than in bacteria 32 3 and archaea 7 4 fig s6 we used the ddrs to estimate the spatial variations of groundwater microbial compositions both bacterial and archaeal communities exhibited significant ddrs during wet and dry seasons mantel spearman s r 0 138 0 409 p 0 05 however the ddrs of fungal community were insignificant mantel r 0 069 0 097 p 0 10 fig 3 a consistent with the above findings the pcoa and anosim statistics confirmed that bacterial and archaeal compositions differed very significantly among distinct latitudinal or longitudinal sample groups in both seasons maximum r anosim 0 358 0 339 0 435 or 0 308 p 0 0001 while the latitudinal and longitudinal differentiations of fungal community were not significant in the wet season r anosim 0 049 0 081 p 0 05 and less pronounced in the dry season maximum r anosim 0 132 p 0 05 fig 3b c overall the three microbial groups in groundwater with salinization presented different temporal or spatial distribution characteristics on alpha and beta diversity bacterial and archaeal compositions had obvious spatial variations while that of fungi was more susceptible to season 3 3 environmental influences on microbial community turnovers correlation network and functional guilds we then investigated how environmental factors shaped the community turnovers of the three microbial groups in groundwater with salinization within all the samples or either one season we observed more significant and stronger correlations between the environmental distance and community bray curtis dissimilarities in bacteria

compositions were more purely influenced by environmental distance than geographic distance during both seasons while the opposite trends were suggested for archaea table s5 compared with bacteria archaeal community was less purely constrained by environmental distance and that of fungi was much less associated with both environmental and geographic distances table s5 thus environmental filtering as a deterministic process drove the bacterial community more than those of archaea and fungi the envfit analysis based on the dbrda was further conducted to select the significant environmental factors fig 4b the bacterial spatiotemporal turnover was mostly contributed by codmn r 2 0 477 na r 2 0 464 tds r 2 0 405 and so4 2 r 2 0 391 p 0 0001 the bacterial spatial

different from those for bacteria and archaea notably the salinization related factors tds so4 2 na cl ca and mg could have more pronounced influences on the bacterial spatiotemporal turnover r 2 0

applied to identify the microbial biomarkers associated with tds and codmn because both of them were the concerning environmental variables fig 1 table s2 that had significant effects on the community turnovers the prokaryotic phyla firmicutes aminicenantes marinimicrobia sar406 clade and wsa2 and classes flavobacteriia clostridia anaerolineae bacteroidetes vc2 1 bac22 and 20a 9 were the typical bacterial or archaeal bio indicators for relatively high tds groundwater 1000 10 000 mg l where their mean abundances were 1 25 28 fold higher than those in the low tds 1000 mg l fig 5 a pseudomonas acinetobacter lutibacter and ca kuenenia were the major genera tolerating high tds fig s7 the prokaryotic phyla chloroflexi aenigmarchaeota and parvarchaeota and classes dehalococcoidia sar202 clade deep sea euryarchaeotic group and marine benthic group a preferred relatively high codmn groundwater 2 8 mg l where the mean abundances were 2 4 6 3 fold higher than those of the low codmn 2 mg l fig 5b for prokaryotic genera syntrophus and desulfitibacter showed the most significant preferences to the high codmn conditions fig s8 in fungi we found that the class leotiomycetes and genera rhodotorula naganishia epicoccum didymella and pseudeurotium flourished in high tds or codmn groundwater even if tds and codmn were not the main ecological drivers for the whole community to explore association patterns among microbial taxa subject to groundwater salinization we inferred metacommunity networks based on spearman correlations r 0 6 bacterial and archaeal otus dominated the overall wet and dry networks 91 5 93 7 of nodes and connected closely inter domain 15 5 21 8 of edges intra domain 76 1 82 6 of edges fig 6 a fig s9a c they had similar node level topological features i e node degree betweenness centrality and closeness centrality which were far higher than those of fungi p 0 0001 in all the networks fig 6b fig s9b d these results indicated that prokaryotic taxa shared similar niches and more often resided in central positions of the network archaea possessed more inter domain connections with bacteria than the intra domain connections aenigmarchaeota mostly connected with bacterial abundant phyla parcubacteria chloroflexi and omnitrophica while thaumarchaeota had the most connections with chloroflexi and proteobacteria in the overall network fig s10 we subsequently generated bacterial archaeal and fungal subnetworks and linked a series of network level topological characteristics to the hydrochemical factors of groundwater we found that codmn was significantly and strongly correlated with the most topological features of the bacterial subnetwork spearman s r 0 260 0 475 or 0 240 0 577 p 0 01 while codmn tds so4 2 na cl ca and mg were significantly and strongly related to the most topological features of the archaeal subnetwork spearman s r 0 157 0 652 or 0 340 0 749 p 0 01 fig 6c these results could be further consolidated by the linear regression analysis based on pearson s correlations fig s11 and s12 temperature toc ph orp and hco3 were only significantly and strongly associated with topological features of the fungal subnetwork spearman s r 0 312 0 627 or 0 336 0 597 p 0 01 fig 6c network properties symbolize the potential ecological associations in a community ma et al 2016 and tds was inclined to have a significant influence on such associations within archaea rather than bacteria and fungi in bsg we elucidated how the environmental variables determined the microbial functional guilds in groundwater fig 7 tds and its major components so4 2 na cl ca mg or k were strongly and negatively correlated with the abundances of guilds like bacterial nitrification nitrite oxidation and respiration nitrogen respiration anammox and archaeal methanogenesis tds spearman s r 0 330 0 428 p 0 05 but positively associated with the abundances of bacterial dark oxidation of sulfur compounds fumarate respiration and cellulolysis tds spearman s r 0 221 0 361 p 0 01 which suggested different responses to salinization among these functional communities consistent with the above results two nitrite oxidizers nitrospira and ca nitrotoga one abundant anammox bacteria ca brocadia and one typical methanogen methanobacterium were identified as the biomarkers for lower tds groundwater fig s7 the abundances of nitrite oxidation respiration and anammox were also negatively related to toc codmn or c n spearman s r 0 341 0 502 p 0 05 the abundance of archaeal ammonia oxidation was strongly and negatively correlated with codmn spearman s r 0 607 p 0 05 two abundant ammonia oxidizing archaea ca nitrosoarchaeum and ca nitrososphaera were identified as the biomarkers of lower codmn groundwater fig s8 which provided a further evidence for the above result temperature ph toc fe or k were positively correlated with the abundances of bacterial guilds for chemoheterotrophy fermentation animal parasites or symbionts human pathogens nitrate reduction and respiration phototrophy dark hydrogen oxidation denitrification and chitinolysis implying the preferences to alkaline or organics rich environments 3 4 relative importance of determinism and stochasticity in governing community assembly processes to quantify the relative contributions of determinism and stochasticity to the observed spatiotemporal patterns we calculated the nsts based on the bray curtis distance during wet and dry seasons both bacterial and archaeal communities were governed by deterministic processes mean nsts 25 3 28 7 while the fungal community was more regulated by stochasticity mean nsts 52 5 52 9 fig 8 a this indicated that the major assembly processes of prokaryotic and fungal communities differed largely in groundwater with salinization besides tds or codmn might influence the balance between determinism and stochasticity bacterial nsts were significantly higher in low tds groundwater average 37 1 than in the brackish saline average 27 0 p 0 01 while fungal nsts displayed the opposite trend i e average 35 9 and 50 1 separately for the low tds and brackish saline groups p 0 05 fig 8b archaeal nsts were significantly higher in high codmn groundwater average 45 4 than in the low codmn average 28 9 p 0 05 fig 8c higher tds putatively led bacterial assembly more deterministic and that of fungi a bit more random and higher codmn might lead archaeal assembly less deterministic in groundwater 4 discussion groundwater salinization has become one of the most serious problems in the studying region and tds concentrations in many sites were even equal to those of coastal areas sang et al 2018 2019 chen et al 2020 a large cone of groundwater depression was also formed in this region zhang and li 2014 which might aggravate salinization the dominant type na so4 2 cl was different from those of coastal regions na cl unno et al 2015 sang et al 2018 but similar with that in an inland area li et al 2016 so4 2 contributed the most to groundwater salinity and it might derive from rock weathering or anthropogenic contamination e g sewage lagoon li et al 2011 2021 evaporation was another non negligible factor affecting the groundwater hydrochemistry which could facilitate the formation of so4 2 type groundwater in alluvial plains like the ncp li et al 2021 atmospheric precipitation had little effects on the chemical evolution in groundwater which was one possible reason for the insignificant seasonal variations of salinization factors groundwater salinization was persistent across wet and dry seasons and its effect on surrounding ecology should be paid attention we obtained the first different spatiotemporal distributions and underlying driving mechanisms among bacterial archaeal and fungal communities in bsg which moved forward compared to previous studies focusing on either one season or microbial domain héry et al 2014 unno et al 2015 sang et al 2018 2019 chen et al 2020 the three life domains differ essentially in genomic proteomic and evolutionary characteristics karlin et al 2002 contributing to their unique biogeography the strengths of ddrs were associated with the relative roles of ecological processes like selection dispersal and drift hanson et al 2012 both correlation and partial mantel analysis suggested that environmental selection rather than geographic distance had a dominant role in driving bacterial spatial turnovers selection represents the differences of relative adaptations to environmental stress among taxa chesson 2000 which differentiates microbial compositions among sites to generate significant ddrs highly diverse bacteria are likely to harbor endemic taxa that are restricted to a particular environment with little overlap of taxa among different habitats hanson et al 2012 for archaea the pure effects of distance on spatial turnovers were stronger than those from selection considering the dominance of determinism this might be ascribed to great roles of unmeasured abiotic biotic factors in giving rise to the significant ddrs rather than those inherent stochastic process drift and dispersal limitation wang et al 2017a zhou and ning 2017 different from prokaryotes fungal compositions showed weak ddrs with less pure environmental or distance effects selection and drift increase the strength of ddrs while dispersal counteracts it hanson et al 2012 we speculated that fungal spatial homogenization was related to the dispersal process tds and codmn were the two most important factors contributing to the significant prokaryotic ddrs tds and its major components had stronger effects on bacterial spatiotemporal turnover than those of the other two taxonomic groups more abundant bacterial phyla or classes were identified as the tds related biomarkers fig 5a gupta et al 2001 and mani et al 2020 suggested that bacteria were more sensitive to salinity than archaea or fungi and the latter two could withstand a wider salinity gradient in aquatic ecosystems which was consistent with our findings the identified dominant fungus cladosporium 12 2 and simplicillium 11 1 of this study together with genera belonging to ascomycota and basidiomycota were reported to survive in other saline environments min et al 2014 gonçalves et al 2017 bouzouina et al 2021 salt tolerant fungi have evolved with diverse special adaptive mechanisms musa et al 2018 these findings offered evidences for the overall lower saline sensitivity of fungi codmn reflects the contents of reducing substances we observed a weak and positive correlation between the concentrations of codmn and toc pearson s adjusted r 2 0 052 p 0 05 this implied that codmn covered not only organics but also inorganic reductants e g sulfur compounds in so4 2 type groundwater li et al 2011 higher codmn had a great selection on genera syntrophus and desulfitibacter fig s8 which can ferment organics and reduce sulfite respectively elshahed and mcinerney 2001 nielsen et al 2006 more abundant prokaryotic phyla or classes were also identified as the codmn related biomarkers compared to those of fungi fig 5b dehalococcoidia as a major class of phylum chloroflexi growing through organohalide respiration wasmund et al 2014 provided a good indication for higher codmn groundwater bacteria and archaea are the dominant participants to drive the redox pathways of both organics and inorganics and form metabolic handoffs within cohorts anantharaman et al 2016 mehrshad et al 2021 the co existed pattern suggested that aenigmarchaeota benefited from such handoffs with chloroflexi and lived with high codmn for another archaeal biomarker parvarchaeota in this study it was also abundant in high cod hot springs chan et al 2017 from a global viewpoint different spatiotemporal dynamics between prokaryotic and fungal communities in bsg could be resulted by distinct environmental drivers and biotic associations bacteria and archaea prevailed in the metacommunity networks and connected positively which supported their similar spatiotemporal distribution patterns as expected while prokaryotes were sensitive to salinity and codmn such compact relationships might confer prokaryotic clusters resilience in the face of environmental perturbation anantharaman et al 2016 they could also benefit from the syntrophism based on different substrates schink and stams 2006 we noted that the dpann phylum aenigmarchaeota dominated the archaeal subnetwork 19 1 of nodes and tended to co occur with bacterial taxa e g chloroflexi 29 3 of inter domain edges fig s10 most dpann archaea have limited genetic capabilities and lack biosynthetic pathways thus they must depend on the symbiotic interactions for obtaining biomolecules baker et al 2020 we also noted significant relationships between tds and archaeal subnetwork topological features instead of those of bacteria which was rarely reported in previous studies thaumarchaeota contributed to a large number of nodes 17 7 and intra inter phylum connections 20 4 and played a critical role in the subnetwork fig 6a fig s10 high tds significantly inhibited the niches of the major taxa e g soil crenarchaeotic group and marine group i of thaumarchaeota fig 5a which could bring about the network topological changes the edge and node numbers modularity and average node degree were all negatively associated with tds fig 6c fig s12 indicating that archaeal taxa were less co existed and more competitive jiao et al 2020 in higher tds groundwater whereas for bacteria the mostly affected phyla e g planctomycetes and nitrospirae by tds played relatively minor roles in the subnetwork thus the tds induced network topological variations were insignificant this implied that the variation of bacterial community composition and network pattern was asynchronous and not necessarily correlated the network based analysis demonstrated different response strengths of species association patterns within bacteria and archaea to tds variations and gained a better understanding in maintaining groundwater ecosystem stability microbial functional guilds related to biogeochemical carbon nitrogen and sulfur cycling responded differently to tds our sequencing data and in situ measurements li et al 2021 indicated inhibitory effects of high salinity on methanogen abundances and activity which was demonstrated in other lab scale studies wang et al 2017b most methanogens are hydrogenotrophs liu and whitman 2008 and they exhibit a low resistance to salinity wang et al 2017b high so4 2 concentration in tds could promote the activity of sulfate reducing microorganisms that compete with methanogens for the electron donor h2 and decline the methane emission li et al 2021 nitrite oxidation and anammox as the major nitrogen functional guilds were also restrained in higher tds environments which was in line with a few experimental studies jeong et al 2018 lin et al 2021 we found no inhibition of higher tds on the abundance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria fig 7 that were reported to be more tolerant to salinity than nitrite oxidizing bacteria jeong et al 2018 it should be noted that varying salt stress and compositions may bring different inhibition levels to freshwater anammox lin et al 2021 as anammox bacteria ca brocadia were reported to contribute largely to the nitrogen loss and no3 n removal in aquifer ecosystems across the world wang et al 2020 we should pay more attention to the effect of groundwater salinization on the subterranean nitrogen load bacterial dark oxidation of sulfur compounds fumarate respiration and cellulolysis were more enriched in higher tds groundwater chemotrophic sulfur oxidizing bacteria are a critical group responsible for the dark oxidation of reduced sulfur and some taxa are extremely or moderately halophilic sorokin et al 2013 fumarate inside their cells could serve as the terminal electron acceptor for the sulfur oxidation lu et al 2018 no significant relations were found between so4 2 and sulfate sulfite or sulfur respiration fig 7 suggesting complex niches within these guilds although these findings are interesting the functional profiles predicted from 16s rrna gene sequencing data are restricted to the available reference genomes in the database wemheuer et al 2020 further utilization of metagenomic approaches is recommended to confirm the effect of salinity on metabolic potentials a quantitative mathematical model based on the nsts demonstrated that determinism and stochasticity governed prokaryotic and fungal community assembling respectively the significant ddrs for prokaryotic communities were attributed to the dominance of determinism which could be underlaid by strong environmental filtering e g bacteria and biotic interactions e g archaea zhou and ning 2017 due to the lower sensitivity to tds or codmn fungal taxa were less constrained by selection less mutually connected and more ecologically equivalent in each season a larger proportion of fungal taxa could be salt resistant and keep active states in saline environments bouzouina et al 2021 they tended to disperse through a wide salinity gradient and displayed the insignificant ddrs although some environmental factors were obviously associated with the fungal turnover mantel tests showed that the overall effect was fairly weak fig 4a table s5 planktonic fungi in a subtropical river were also shaped by stochasticity with a high dispersal rate chen et al 2019b both surface and subterranean aquatic fungi could display a good adaptation to environmental disturbance intriguingly we suggested that higher tds might drive bacterial and fungal community assembling more deterministic and random separately and higher codmn might lead that of archaea less deterministic determinism makes the community structure and functions predictable and stochasticity makes them uncertain zhou and ning 2017 the increasing salinization could make bacterial ecological patterns much easier to be predicted it has been widely acceptable to employ artificial intelligence approaches like neural networks to forecast bacterial assemblages based on environmental parameters and biotic interactions larsen et al 2012 in this case our study may provide crucial supports for such predictive models that can be generalized to other similar environments which is valuable to assist bacterial ecology monitoring however it should be noted that archaeal and fungal community assembling was apt to disorder in higher tds or codmn groundwater these two factors also altered the compositions of prokaryotes that involve in the biogeochemical cycling in views of microbial diversity preservation and ecosystem stabilization appropriate regulation and in situ remediation of tds and codmn in groundwater are particularly needed while this study has gained a comprehensive knowledge about microbial diversity and structure in bsg based on high throughput sequencing with statistical analysis further cultivation based experiments are desirable to understand physiological characteristics and biotic direct or indirect associations carr et al 2019 which helps obtain deeper insights into microbial behaviors during groundwater salinization 5 conclusions this study gained the first comprehensive insights into different spatiotemporal dynamics ecological drivers and assembly processes of bacterial archaeal and fungal communities in groundwater with salinization tds concentration up to 9529 6 mg l we demonstrated significant spatial differentiations for prokaryotic communities and the most evident seasonal variation for fungal community environmental filtering drove bacterial compositions rather than those of archaea and fungi specifically tds had a more significant influence on bacterial spatiotemporal turnover than on those of the other two taxonomic groups and codmn mainly affected the prokaryotic community variations although massive bacterial and archaeal taxa dominated the network and had close relationships tds mostly affected potential species associations within archaea lower tds groundwater favored particular functional guilds like bacterial nitrite oxidation anammox and archaeal methanogenesis while bacterial dark oxidation of sulfur compounds fumarate respiration and cellulolysis were enriched in the higher tds lastly we confirmed that prokaryotic community assembling was governed by determinism and fungi assembling was more regulated by stochasticity higher tds might lead bacterial assembly more deterministic and that of fungi more random these results highlighted the unique responses of the three microbial domains
