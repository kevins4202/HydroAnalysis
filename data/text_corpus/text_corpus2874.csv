14370,the fundamental understanding of mass transfer kinetics is essential for biosorption of phosphorus by aerobic granular sludge ags to gain an insight into biological processes regarding the treatment of wastewater with high organic load the removal of phosphorus by ags from palm oil mill effluent was performed in a sequencing batch reactor sbr while the experimental data were assessed using the modified mass transfer factor mmtf models to get better understanding on the mechanisms of external and internal mass transfer a zigzag pattern of the k l a g k l a f and k l a d variations was verified before and after addition of serratia marcescens sa30 due to the variations of organic loading rate and total phosphorus concentration were observed at every additional 50 new sample into the sbr this study verified that the biosorption process is controlled by transport of phosphorus through a film of external fitting ags the analysis of sbr performance shows a logarithmic increase in the efficiency of phosphorus removal with increasing of the k l a g value a new insight of the dynamic ags growth of biological process revealed by the mmtf models may contribute to the advanced treatment of high organic content wastewater keywords mass transfer kinetic palm oil mill effluent phosphorous biosorption sequencing batch reactor serratia marcescenssa30 1 introduction one of the key economic drivers of agricultural sector for indonesia and malaysia is the palm oil industry and this has been considered as one of the most important determinants of agriculture based commerce for both countries 1 production of crude palm oil cpo in the last two decades has ramped up to recently rank first for indonesia with 33 million metric tonnes and second for malaysia with 19 8 million metric tonnes of cpo production and has contributed to the world cpo production in a range of 85 90 unfortunately one of the main causes of environmental pollution in indonesia and malaysia generated from palm oil mill effluent pome is due to the poor quality of treated pome to be discharged into aquatic ecosystem without processed through an effective treatment is responsible for the degradation of the receiving surface water body 2 pome contains lignocellulolytic waste that does mix well with oil and carbohydrates the concentrations of oil and grease o g chemical oxygen demand cod and total solids ts in the raw pome have been reported in the ranges of 2 to 10 6 g l 1 45 2 to 96 3 g l 1 and 17 to 55 g l 1 respectively 3 7 while the concentration of total phosphorus tp would be in a range of 95 125 mgp l 1 5 4 7 it is suggested that tp is a better way to measure phosphorus because it includes both po4 3 and organic phosphorus 8 the microbial based technologies of treating pome have been widely practised in malaysia using the cascade ponds under anaerobic facultative and aerobic conditions 9 10 however many conventional cascade ponds have been rendered obsolete and can only ensure compatibility of treament plant with a low efficiency due to the sensibility of biological process to the natural cause of climate change and the variability of removal efficiency with the variations of ph and o2 11 the organic matters contained in pome can be degraded by anaerobic and facultative microorganisms to release small molecules in the forms of ch4 co2 h2s and h2o 12 in spite of the many biological processes have been practised for the removal of phosphorus secondary effluents containing high amounts of po4 3 and tp are still released into the environment 13 14 even though the conventional ponding processes which generate a huge sludge amount and cover a large land area may be considered reliable and cost effective technologies for the removal of cod from pome they cannot be optimised for the goal of removing po4 3 and tp which can cause the environmental problems of growing algae faster than ecosystems can handle efforts have been made by certain developed countries with the strategy builds on the policy of establishing a very strict phosphorous effluent limit for examples the european union through the council directive 78 659 eec of 18 july 1978 on fresh water quality supports the biodiversity conservation of the european countries that the permissible concentrations of tp to ensure good water quality for river and lake should be in the ranges of 0 01 0 07 μg l 1 and 10 100 μg l 1 respectively 15 16 the united states of america regulates the permissible concentrations of tp being not exceeded 100 μg l 1 for streamwater and 50 μg l 1 for stream discharged into lake or reservoir 17 biosorption of various heavy metal ions and toxic organics by different kinds of biomaterials has been considered as a promising technology to be used for the environmental remediation 18 19 many biomaterials such as fungal biomass marine algae and waste activated sludge have been used as biosorbents for the treatment of wastewater 20 22 the use of 3 mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane modified kaolin as adsorbent has great potential for the removal of hg ii from aqueous solution 23 the use of 3 mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane modified bentonite could be effective for the removal of cd ii from aquatic environment 24 the use of pumice as adsorbent can remove more than 81 of the 4 4 dimethyl amino benzophenoni mide auramin o from solution at the optimum conditions 25 a major technical problem associated with the biosorbents currently used in the form of suspended biomass sb is still not effective for repeated long term treatment process of being caused difficult post separation of sb released from a treated effluent 26 27 the most important criteria are the stability and settleability of granular sludge to have an effective separation of the biosorbents from the effluent of treated wastewater to possibly allow the reuse of biosorbents to other purposes aerobic granular sludge ags technology is the potential pome treatment process and provides several advantages compared to conventional process of activated sludge based treatment the application of ags technology is one of the most effective ways to reduce energy consumption reactor volume and land area there is due to it is easier with process control fast settling sludge and toxic tolerance and can also offers the excellent effluent quality 28 29 wastewater treatment by accumulation of organisms in ags has been practised to remove cod phosphorus and nitrogen simultanously using a sequencing batch reactor sbr 30 32 although the treatment of wastewater by ags technology at laboratory pilot and full scale commercial operation in sbr has been made 33 35 study on the mass transfer kinetics of phosphorus biosorption by ags can gain a new insight into the behaviour of tp removal from pome for optimising the performance of sbr process even though the biosorption of oxidisable organic matter and nitrogen by ags can determine the resistance of mass transfer 30 31 the application of ags technology to investigate the kinetics of mass transfer for phosphorus biosorption in sbr is still not fully understood since there is no known correlation of mass transfer coefficient for phosphorus biosorption to sbr performance this study determines the correlation between global mass transfer factor and tp removal efficiency for the phosphorus biosorption experiments both with and without an addition of serratia marcescens sa30 therefore this study aims 1 to investigate the use of inoculum source generated from a mixture of anaerobic and activated sludge to develop the ags in sbr for use in removing the phosphorous matter from pome 2 to analyse the tp concentrations monitored at inlet and outlet of the sbr treatment system without and with the presence of serratia marcescens sa30 strain in pome and 3 to use the modified mass transfer factor mmtf models for simulating the experimental data for getting new insights into the behaviours of phosphorus removal by ags technology 2 materials and methods 2 1 palm oil mill effluent and sludges the pome samples collected from an anaerobic pond of the palm oil industry at kahang of johor state malaysia were used during this study due to the treated pome released from cascade anaerobic ponds into the environment contains high level of phosphorous matter characteristics of the pome quality would be dependent on the palm oil manufacturing process and its production materials 36 table 1 shows the main characteristics of pome quality used for this study compared to the quality of pomes reported in the literatures table 1 doesn t report the concentration of o g but it still exists in the treated pome used in this work while the presence of o g in the sbr treatment system can inhibit the process of tp removal from pome by ags technology centrifugation at 15 000 rpm for 40 min to remove debris from each pome sample was carried out and then the sample was stored at 4 c for the future experiments the ph of pome sample to feed the sbr was adjusted with 1 m hcl solution to reach at ph 7 2 the inoculum source to develop the ags made up of using 0 5 l of anaerobic sludge collected from an anaerobic pond of the palm oil factory at kahang johor and 0 5 l of activated sludge collected from a local municipal wastewater treatment plant at skudai johor bahru was mixed to produce 1 l of sludge the use of a mixed inoculum is due to the development of ags needs to perform in two phases of anaerobic and aerobic reaction any debris and large particles in the inoculum source was removed by a guaranteed test sieve to meet the specifications issued by the american society for testing materials no 16 the acclimatisation of filtered sludge into 1 l of pome was carried out for one month during the start up period of sbr treatment processed to develop ags 1 l mixed sludge and 1 l pome was mixed to yield a total volume of 2 l in the sbr where the concentration of ts would be approximately 9 g l 1 after inoculation even if the presence of aspergillus niger strain in a wastewater can support the treatment process of phosphorus removal from an iron ore concentrate 37 this study used the serratia marcescens sa30 strain isolated by fulazzaky et al 38 to develop the ags 2 2 operating procedure of sequencing batch reactor the sbr used in this study as shown in fig 1 consists of 1 one reactor of acrylic plexiglass column with 100 cm height 8 cm inner diameter and 4 l volume 2 one storage tank of 5 l 2 one timer controlled peristaltic pump of electronic digital mains timer socket plug in with lcd display 12 24 h 7 days for regulating the flow rate of pome entered the reactor 4 one recycling pipe 5 one timer controlled peristaltic pump for circulating the pome from the top to bottom of the reactor 6 one aerator of 100 w lp 100 silent red oxygen pump 7 one timer controlled peristaltic pump for releasing the pome from reactor and 8 one storage tank of the treated pome 30 31 the operating procedure of sbr based on fill and draw principle consisting of five steps fill react settle decant and idle was performed during this work every 1 l of pome entered the reactor has a typical tp concentration and organic loading rate olr the hydraulic retention times hrts of 6 12 6 and 4 h were set to run the experiments without added the strain of serratia marcescens sa30 during the periods of 7 105 48 and 18 d respectively the hrts of 4 12 72 and 144 h were set to run the experiments with the presence of serratia marcescens sa30 strain during the periods of 15 3 9 and 54 d respectively see table 2 hrt does not affect the ags development but plays an important role in sludge retention and sludge production 39 this sbr system has a constant 2 l working volume and 30 2 c of operating temperature there is due the strain of serratia marcescens grown at 30 c produces the red pigment prodigiosin and is of interest in the bioengineering of such strain to synthesise useful prodiginine derivatives 40 a uniform temperature distribution was adjusted with circulation of water temperature through the jacket of reactor the monitoring of the ph level of pome in the sbr was carried out using a ph meter of orion 2 star benchtop ph meter alternate phases of 3 h anaerobic and 3 h aerobic reaction were set for the react step of treating the pome in sbr during anaerobic reaction phase flow model regulated by peristaltic pump of cole parmer masterflex l s peristaltic pump 7523 60 w 77800 62 and mixed by circulation small proportion of pome through recycling pipe may represent the actual flow patterns fine air bubbles supplied through a dispenser from the aerator to bottom of the reactor with an airflow superficial velocity rate of 2 cm s 1 during aerobic reaction phase can aerate and thus mix the pome in sbr three peristaltic pumps of the sbr system that the first one used to feed the pome into the second one used to circulate the pome within and the third one used to withdraw the pome from sbr must be taken with care due to the pulsations during the experiments may occur supernatant of 50 volumetric exchange ratio ver withdrawal through outlet port of the sbr must be regularly performed to maintain the alternate phases of anaerobic and aerobic reaction analysis of tp concentrations monitored at inlet and outlet of the sbr system were carried out for the raw and treated pome respectively 2 3 analytical methods the analysis of the tp concentrations for the raw and treated pome were carried out using the molybdovanadate method with acid persulfate digestion to get reading with spectrophotometer of hach dr6000 spectrophotometer jenway usa this analysis was performed after digestion by heating the pome sample in a tp test n tube vial consisting of 5 ml pome and 5 ml deionised water in the drb200 digital reactor block 15 x 16 mm vial wells at 150 c for 30 min and then colourisation by adding a 1 54 n sodium hydroxide of 2 0 ml and a molybdovanadate reagent of 0 5 ml 2 4 data simulation the tp removal efficiency of the sbr process to treat pome can be calculated using the equation of 1 e c o c s c o 100 where e is the tp removal efficiency of the sbr in c o is the inlet tp concentration of the sbr in mg l 1 c s is the outlet tp concentration of the sbr in mg l 1 the calculation of the amount of tp accumulated into ags when using a feed tp concentration with its olr can be performed using the formula 41 of 2 q 0 v c o c s d v m where q is the cumulative amount of tp entered into ags mg g 1 v is the effective volume of pome treated in the sbr l and m is the dried mass of ags g the mmtf models proposed by fulazzaky et al 42 have been used to study the behaviours of o g biosorption assimilated by bacterial cells of serratia marcescens sa30 from food processing industrial effluent and then attached on the surface of oil palm frond in a packed bed column reactor 38 it is assumed that the biosorption of phosphorus by ags technology should successively pass three locations extracellular precipitation cell surface sorption and intracellular accumulation 43 whereas the first location of extracellular precipitation may relate to the external mass transfer emt and both the second and third locations of cell surface sorption and intracellular accumulation may relate to the internal mass transfer imt therefore the use of the mmtf models in this work can do to investigate the kinetics of mass transfer for the biosorption of phosphorous matter by ags in sbr such that 3 l n c o c s k l a g e β l n q t where k l a g is the global mass transfer factor h 1 β is the absorbate adsorbent affinity parameter g h mg 1 and t is the time of running the experimental h a deduction of eqn 3 can mathematically yield a linear equation 42 of 4 ln q 1 β ln t b with 5 b ln k l a g ln l n c o c s β where b is the potential mass transfer index related to driving force of mass transfer during the biosorption of phosphorous matter mg g 1 the correlation of emt factor to global mass transfer gmt factor can be expressed in form of the equation 42 6 k l a f k l a g e β l n q where k l a f is the external mass transfer factor h 1 the variation of k l a g to follow the c 0 c s ratio and that of k l a f to follow the q value can be determined using eqn 5 and eqn 6 respectively since both the values of β and b as shown in eqn 4 have been verified correctly on the straight line of plotting ln q versus ln t it is recognised that internal mass transfer imt factor is the difference between the factors of gmt and emt and thus can be expressed by the equation 42 of 7 k l a d k l a g k l a f where k l a d is the internal mass transfer factor h 1 the variation of k l a d can be determined using eqn 7 since the variation of k l a g and that of k l a f have been verified using eqn 5 and eqn 6 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the sequencing batch reactor the tp removal efficiency of sbr to treat pome would be dependent on many variances of process variables such as initial concentration and flow rate 44 the results fig 2 show that the variations of tp concentration from 14 to 91 mg p l 1 to have an average of 50 mg p l 1 see fig 2 line 1 and from 0 to 36 mg p l 1 to have an average of 15 mg p l 1 see fig 2 line 2 were verified at inlet and outlet of the sbr system respectively before the addition of serratia marcescens sa30 strain asm into the reactor the variations of tp concentration were verified from 33 to 105 mg p l 1 to have an average of 66 mg p l 1 see fig 2 line 1 and from 5 to 62 mg p l 1 to have an average of 29 mg p l 1 see fig 2 line 2 at inlet and outlet of the sbr system respectively after asm in the reactor the performance of sbr expressed in of tp removal varies from 18 to 100 to have an average of 65 without and from 18 to 93 to have an average of 53 with the presence of serratia marcescens sa30 strain see fig 2 line 3 after reaching steady state conditions from 16 to 98 d of the experimental run the sbr performance highly increases due the biological tp removal by ags technology induces into denitrifying and phosphate uptake under an anaerobic anoxic aerobic alternating operation 45 whereas the settling ags velocity of 81 m h 1 could be higher than the settling conventional activated sludge velocity of ranging from 7 8 to 12 2 m h 1 46 the accumulation of phosphorus predominantly caused by the mechanism of luxury uptake could be due to the biomass was not starved of phosphate 47 49 the efficiency of tp removal from 100 to 178 d of the experiment decreases due to the tp released by decomposer bacteria becomes part of the pool of inorganic phosphate in the reactor the tp release rate associated with volatile fatty acid uptake and sulfate reduction has been reported 50 while many factors such as nitrite ags and ph can significantly affect the anaerobic tp release and anoxic tp uptake by the sbr process 51 the development of ags without added serratia marcescens sa30 strain can accumulate a large amount of o g but only reduces a small amount of tp in spite of the organic contained phosphorous matters are biodegradable this indicates that a new approach that deals with the presence of serratia marcescens sa30 strain in the sbr is important the tp removal efficiency of sbr with the presence of serratia marcescens sa30 strain increases from 18 at 184 d to 93 at 250 d of the experimental run the role of bacterial matabolism to degrade o g may increase the efficiency of tp removal 36 due to a decrease in the water immiscible organic liquid interfacial tension may occur 52 3 2 analysis of straight line plotting data by plotting ln q versus ln t see fig 3 can be obtained a straight line with 1 β as slope and b as the y intercept where a very good fit to the experimental data was verified by the graph of straight line r 2 0 915 see table 3 using the values of b and β permit us to investigate the mass transfer kinetics of phosphorus biosorption by the ags development without and with the presence of serratia marcescens sa30 strain in the sbr biosorption of phosphorus by ags depends on the behaviour of phosphorus passing through three successive points of extracellular precipitation located outside of the biomass cell surface sorption located at interfacial water biomass and intracellular accumulation located within the biomass 43 therefore different environmental conditions related to the presence or absence of serratia marcescens sa30 strain in the sbr can affect the mass transfer kinetics of phosphorus biosorption and controls the efficiency of tp removal the value of β can increase from 1 96 g h mg 1 without to 48 54 g h mg 1 with the presence of serratia marcescens sa30 in the sbr in addition the value of b increases from 5 655 mg g 1 without to 9 776 mg g 1 with the presence of serratia marcescens sa30 in sbr see table 3 an increase in the values of β and b is due an intermittent cross link caused by the peptidoglycan in gram negative bacteria of serratia marcescens sa30 is thin which is approximately 15 20 of cell wall being peptidoglycan 53 biosorption mechanisms of phosphorus by ags may associate with active chemical groups and intracellular accumulation consisting the interactions by physical sorption ion exchange and chemical bond 54 both the cause and the mechanisms of phosphorus accumulated into ags need to be verified and thus can be investigated by the mmtf models to get a new insight on the external and internal mass transfer of transporting the phosphorous matters energetic heterogeneity can be associated with the presence of sorbing sites characterised with their typical chemical properties at the surface of ags and with the pores characterised with their typical geometries depending on the biosorption mechanism bacterial structure and bacterial surface characteristics 55 self immobilisation during the granulation process can result in cell structured shape which is characterised by a dense biomass of it 56 the cell wall of ags may compose many types of chemicals lipids polysaccharides and proteins which offer abundant functional groups like amino acids carboxyl hydroxyl and phosphate and also offer abundant hydrophobic adsorption sites like aliphatic carbon chains and aromatic rings 57 58 a high content of the cell surface hydrophobicity and polysaccharides may play a very important role in the formation of ags during the biosorption process in spite of the amount of polysaccharides available on the cell wall would be dependent on the typical species of bacteria and environmental growth conditions the removal of polysaccharides presented on the cell wall can be done by either simple mechanical disruption or chemical washing 59 3 3 kinetics of global external and internal mass transfer using the mmtf models permit us to investigate the kinetics of global and sequential mass transfers of both film mass transfer and mass diffusion within ags 38 42 by plotting the curves fig 4 of k l a versus t can provide the conformational variations of k l a g k l a f and k l a d pursuant to the time of running the experiment it is due to the different olrs of being connected with 50 of ver leading to a number of competitions affected the kinetics of mass transfer contribute to the overall reaction rate 60 the kinetic rates of gmt emt and imt for the biosorption of phosphorous matter by ags without and with the presence of serratia marcescens sa30 strain in the sbr can be evaluated using the trend in the values of k l a g k l a f and k l a d a zigzag pattern of k l a g and k l a d values is very similar from each other and stands very high compared to that of k l a f values whereas a zigzag pattern is due to olr entering the sbr varies empirical evidence verified that the values of k l a f are negligible compared to those of k l a d along the curves in fig 4a b leading to a conclusion that the resistance of mass transfer for phosphorus biosorption is dependent on emt therefore the transport of phosphorus from the bulk water to extracellular precipitation on the surface of ags is controlled by emt it is suggested that rate limiting step in the development of ags could be dependent on emt resistance because of the imt resistance and kinetic limitations of mass transfer are negligible in rolling the resistance of mass transfer 61 detail biosorption yields in the removal of phosphorus by ags technology affecting the imt rate can be investigated under two environmental conditions of without and with the presence of serratia marcescens sa30 strain in the sbr due to the strain of serratia marcescens sa30 has an important role in removing o g from pome by reducing oil water interfacial tension the primary concern of this study is to use the mmtf models for investigating the biosorption kinetics of tp removed by ags development from pome in the absence and presence of serratia marcescens sa30 strain in sbr 38 this attempts to gain a new knowledge on the applicability of the mmtf models and provides insights on the film mass transfer and mass diffusion within ags investigation of the response mechanisms and mass transfer kinetics by serratia marcescens sa30 strain in the accumulation of phosphorous matter into ags is important to get a depth understanding of the dynamic behaviours of mass transfer 21 62 the growth potential of ags toward the removal of tp from pome after adding the strain of serratia marcescens sa30 is higher than that before adding the strain of serratia marcescens sa30 effect of the exponential growth of serratia marcescens sa30 on imt could be very remarkable there is due to the presence of serratia marcescens sa30 in the sbr can stimulate the digestion of organic matter and the absorption of phosphorus from the extracellular precipitation to cellular tissue experimental evidence fig 4a b shows that the value of k l a d ranged from 12 48 to 260 94 h 1 with an average of 84 45 h 1 without added the serratia marcescens sa30 strain fig 4a is far lower than that ranged from 350 14 to 4604 78 h 1 with an average of 1642 12 h 1 with the presence of serratia marcescens sa30 strain in sbr fig 4b even though it provides the only one indicator of the reaction kinetics the effects of exponential growth of serratia marcescens sa30 and emulsification on the ags development can lead to a great motive force in the transport of phosphorous molecules to cell surface sorption from extracellular precipitation rapidly and then from cell surface sorption to intracellular accumulation growth potential of the biomass is much greater with the presence of serratia marcescens sa30 compared to that without the addition of serratia marcescens sa30 in sbr the role of the biosurfactants produced by serratia marcescens sa30 is an effective way to increase the phosphorous bioaccumulation to remarkably increasing the kinetic rate of imt a high rate of imt can accelarate the growth of granule and the yield of biomass and thus reduces the thickness membrane of bacterial cells leading to an increased sorption of cell surface 38 63 64 the role of serratia marcescens sa30 strain in the sbr may intracellularly stimulate the phosphorus sorption during the process of ags growth and produces the interfering biosurfactants which is able to regulate the bacterial metabolisms and growth of bacterial cells in response to environmental cues due to the presence of o g in the pome sample 65 this is the biological phenomena that contribute to the rate of imt differing by two environmental conditions of absence and presence of the serratia marcescens sa30 in the sbr see fig 4a b 3 4 correlation between global mass transfer and tp removal efficiency by plotting the curve fig 5 of e versus k l a g provides a logarithmically increasing trend line of the tp removal efficiency with increasing of the gmt factor according to the numerical simulation the maximum tp removal efficiency of 100 can be achieved when the value of k l a g is at 229 32 h 1 and when the experiment is setup without any of serratia marcescens sa30 strain in the sbr but takes long time see fig 5a as a result over 178 d of the treatment can be either continued to treat the pome with a low efficiency of the tp removal and less stable sbr operation or considered to propose other operating conditions by adding the strain of serratia marcescens sa30 in the sbr in spite of many types of microorganisms that naturally live with ags can grow and act to remove a certain amount of tp from pome 66 the rate of gmt in the formation of ags could be dependent on the solubility of other elements and the positive influence of certain microorganisms fig 5b shows that the sbr performance to remove the phosphorous matter can reach at approximately 93 of its maximum efficiency when the process of pome treatment supported by the presence of serratia marcescens sa30 in the sbr was carried out when the value of k l a g reaches at 4604 78 h 1 since the multiplication rate of exponential serratia marcescens sa30 growth produces a large amount of the biosurfactants this can reduce the oil water interfacial tension 38 67 and greatly affects the gmt rate the presence of the biosurfactants in sbr can boost bacterial metabolism and acts independently from biotic and abiotic environmental factors 68 69 therefore the addition of serratia marcescens sa30 in the sbr can do the role to stimulate the development of ags and consequently leads to a logarithmically increase in the efficiency of tp removal during 144 d of the experiment 4 conclusions in this work the mmtf models were used to determine the gmt emt and imt factors for investigating the phosphorous biosorption by ags technology from pome in the sbr the data of monitoring the tp concentrations collected at inlet and outlet of the sbr treatment system can be analysed to get better understanding on two different environmental conditions of modelling and simulation to determine the kinetics of global external and internal mass transfer based on the values of k l a g k l a f and k l a d respectively a zigzag pattern of the values of k l a g and k l a d is very similar to each other and is much higher than that of the values of k l a f to most likely due to every 1 l pome sample entering the sbr could be characterised by its typical amount of the tp concentration and also typical olr the phosphorous biosorption by ags technology in the sbr is controlled by the resistance of emt the sbr performance to remove a certain amount of tp from pome has been verified to logarithmically increase with increasing of the gmt rate and may contribute to designing the further sbr treatment system declaration of competing interest all the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgment the

of the receiving surface water body 2 pome contains lignocellulolytic waste that does mix well with oil and carbohydrates the concentrations of oil and grease o g chemical oxygen demand cod and total solids ts in the raw pome have been reported in the ranges of 2 to 10 6 g l 1 45 2 to 96 3 g l 1 and 17 to 55 g l 1 respectively 3 7 while the concentration of total phosphorus tp would be in a range of 95 125 mgp l 1 5 4 7 it is suggested that tp is a better way to measure phosphorus because it includes both po4 3 and organic phosphorus 8 the microbial based technologies of treating pome have been widely practised in malaysia using the cascade ponds under anaerobic facultative and aerobic conditions 9 10 however many conventional cascade ponds have been rendered obsolete and can only ensure compatibility of treament plant with a low efficiency due to the sensibility of biological process to the natural cause of climate change and the variability of removal efficiency with the

of the many biological processes have been practised for the removal of phosphorus secondary effluents containing high amounts of po4 3 and tp are still released into the environment 13 14 even though the conventional ponding processes which generate a huge sludge amount and cover a large land area may be considered reliable and cost effective technologies for the removal of cod from pome they cannot be optimised for the goal of removing po4 3 and tp which can cause the environmental problems of growing algae faster than ecosystems can handle efforts have been made by certain developed countries with the strategy builds on the policy of establishing a very strict phosphorous effluent limit for examples the european union through the council directive 78 659 eec of 18 july 1978 on fresh water quality supports the biodiversity conservation of the european countries that the permissible concentrations of tp to ensure good water quality for river and lake should be in the ranges of 0 01 0 07 μg l 1 and 10 100 μg l 1 respectively 15 16 the united states of america regulates the permissible concentrations of tp being not exceeded 100 μg l 1 for streamwater and 50 μg l 1 for stream discharged into lake or reservoir 17 biosorption of various heavy metal ions and toxic organics by different kinds of biomaterials has been considered as a promising technology to be used for the environmental remediation 18 19 many biomaterials such as fungal biomass marine algae and waste activated sludge have been used as biosorbents for the treatment of wastewater 20 22 the use of 3 mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane modified kaolin as adsorbent has great potential for the removal of hg ii from aqueous solution 23 the use of 3 mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane modified bentonite could be effective for the removal of cd ii from aquatic environment 24 the use of pumice as adsorbent can remove more than 81 of the 4 4 dimethyl amino benzophenoni mide auramin o from solution at the optimum conditions 25 a major technical problem associated with the biosorbents currently used in the form of suspended biomass sb is still not effective for repeated long term treatment process of being caused difficult post separation of sb released from a treated effluent 26 27 the most important criteria are the stability and settleability of granular sludge to have an effective separation of the biosorbents from the effluent of treated wastewater to possibly allow the reuse of biosorbents to other purposes aerobic granular sludge ags technology is the potential pome treatment process and provides several advantages compared to conventional process of activated sludge based treatment the application of ags technology is one of the most effective ways to reduce energy consumption reactor volume and land area there is due to it is easier with process control fast settling sludge and toxic tolerance and can also offers the excellent effluent quality 28 29 wastewater treatment by accumulation of organisms in ags has been practised to remove cod phosphorus and nitrogen simultanously using a sequencing batch reactor sbr 30 32 although the treatment of wastewater by ags technology at laboratory pilot and full scale commercial operation in sbr has been made 33 35 study on the mass transfer kinetics of phosphorus biosorption by ags can gain a new insight into the behaviour of tp removal from pome for optimising the performance of sbr process even though the biosorption of oxidisable organic matter and nitrogen by ags can determine the resistance of mass transfer 30 31 the application of ags technology to investigate the kinetics of mass transfer for phosphorus biosorption in sbr is still not fully understood since there is no known correlation of mass transfer coefficient for phosphorus biosorption to sbr performance this study determines the correlation between global mass transfer factor and tp removal efficiency for the phosphorus biosorption experiments both with and without an addition of serratia marcescens sa30 therefore this study aims 1 to investigate the use of inoculum source generated from a mixture of anaerobic and activated sludge to develop the ags in sbr for use in removing the phosphorous matter from pome 2 to analyse the tp concentrations monitored at inlet and outlet of the sbr treatment system without and with the presence of serratia marcescens sa30 strain in pome and 3 to use the modified mass transfer factor mmtf models for simulating the experimental data for getting new insights into the behaviours of phosphorus removal by ags technology 2 materials and methods 2 1 palm oil mill effluent and sludges the pome samples collected from an anaerobic pond of the palm oil industry at kahang of johor state malaysia were used during this study due to the treated pome released from cascade anaerobic ponds into the environment contains high level of phosphorous matter characteristics of the pome quality would be dependent on the palm oil manufacturing process and its production materials 36 table 1 shows the main characteristics of pome quality used for this study compared to the quality of pomes reported in the literatures table 1 doesn t report the concentration of o g but it still exists in the treated pome used in this work while the presence of o g in the sbr treatment system can inhibit the process of tp removal from pome by ags technology centrifugation at 15 000 rpm for 40 min to remove debris from each pome sample was carried out and then the sample was stored at 4 c for the future experiments the ph of pome sample to feed the sbr was adjusted with 1 m hcl solution to reach at ph 7 2 the inoculum source to develop the ags made up of using 0 5 l of anaerobic sludge collected from an anaerobic pond of the palm oil factory at kahang johor and 0 5 l of activated sludge collected from a local municipal wastewater treatment plant at skudai johor bahru was mixed to produce 1 l of sludge the use of a mixed inoculum is due to the development of ags needs to perform in two phases of anaerobic and aerobic reaction any debris and large particles in the inoculum source was removed by a guaranteed test sieve to meet the specifications issued by the american society for testing materials no 16 the acclimatisation of filtered sludge into 1 l of pome was carried out for one month during the start up period of sbr treatment processed to develop ags 1 l mixed sludge and 1 l pome was mixed to yield a total volume of 2 l in the sbr where the concentration of ts would be approximately 9 g l 1 after inoculation even if the presence of aspergillus niger strain in a wastewater can support the treatment process of phosphorus removal from an iron ore concentrate 37 this study used the serratia marcescens sa30 strain isolated by fulazzaky et al 38 to develop the ags 2 2 operating procedure of sequencing batch reactor the sbr used in this study as shown in fig 1 consists of 1 one reactor of acrylic plexiglass column with 100 cm height 8 cm inner diameter and 4 l volume 2 one storage tank of 5 l 2 one timer controlled peristaltic pump of electronic digital mains timer socket plug in with lcd display 12 24 h 7 days for regulating the flow rate of pome entered the reactor 4 one recycling pipe 5 one timer controlled peristaltic pump for circulating the pome from the top to bottom of the reactor 6 one aerator of 100 w lp 100 silent red oxygen pump 7 one timer controlled peristaltic pump for releasing the pome from reactor and 8 one storage tank of the treated pome 30 31 the operating procedure of sbr based on fill and draw principle consisting of five steps fill react settle decant and idle was performed during this work every 1 l of pome entered the reactor has a typical tp concentration and organic loading rate olr the hydraulic retention times hrts of 6 12 6 and 4 h were set to run the experiments without added the strain of serratia marcescens sa30 during the periods of 7 105 48 and 18 d respectively the hrts of 4 12 72 and 144 h were set to run the experiments with the presence of serratia marcescens sa30 strain during the periods of 15 3 9 and 54 d respectively see table 2 hrt does not affect the ags development but plays an important role in sludge retention and sludge production 39 this sbr system has a constant 2 l working volume and 30 2 c of operating temperature there is due the strain of serratia marcescens grown at 30 c produces the red pigment prodigiosin and is of interest in the bioengineering of such strain to synthesise useful prodiginine derivatives 40 a uniform temperature distribution was adjusted with circulation of water temperature through the jacket of reactor the monitoring of the ph level of pome in the sbr was carried out using a ph meter of orion 2 star benchtop ph meter alternate phases of 3 h anaerobic and 3 h aerobic reaction were set for the react step of treating the pome in sbr during anaerobic reaction phase flow model regulated by peristaltic pump of cole parmer masterflex l s peristaltic pump 7523 60 w 77800 62 and mixed by circulation small proportion of pome through recycling pipe may represent the actual flow patterns fine air bubbles supplied through a dispenser from the aerator to bottom of the reactor with an airflow superficial velocity rate of 2 cm s 1 during aerobic reaction phase can aerate and thus mix the pome in sbr three peristaltic pumps of the sbr system that the first one used to feed the pome into the second one used to circulate the pome within and the third one used to withdraw the pome from sbr must be taken with care due to the pulsations during the experiments may occur supernatant of 50 volumetric exchange ratio ver withdrawal through outlet port of the sbr must be regularly performed to maintain the alternate phases of anaerobic and aerobic reaction analysis of tp concentrations monitored at inlet and outlet of the sbr system were carried out for the raw and treated pome respectively 2 3 analytical methods the analysis of the tp concentrations for the raw and treated pome were carried out using the molybdovanadate method with acid persulfate digestion to get reading with spectrophotometer of hach dr6000 spectrophotometer jenway usa this analysis was performed after digestion by heating the pome sample in a tp test n tube vial consisting of 5 ml pome and 5 ml deionised water in the drb200 digital reactor block 15 x 16 mm vial wells at 150 c for 30 min and then colourisation by adding a 1 54 n sodium hydroxide of 2 0 ml and a molybdovanadate reagent of 0 5 ml 2 4 data simulation the tp removal efficiency of the sbr process to treat pome can be calculated using the equation of 1 e c o c s c o 100 where e is the tp removal efficiency of the sbr in c o is the inlet tp concentration of the sbr in mg l 1 c s is the outlet tp concentration of the sbr in mg l 1 the calculation of the amount of tp accumulated into ags when using a feed tp concentration with its olr can be performed using the formula 41 of 2 q 0 v c o c s d v m where q is the cumulative amount of tp entered into ags mg g 1 v is the effective volume of pome treated in the sbr l and m is the dried mass of ags g the mmtf models proposed by fulazzaky et al 42 have been used to study the behaviours of o g biosorption assimilated by bacterial cells of serratia marcescens sa30 from food processing industrial effluent and then attached on the surface of oil palm frond in a packed bed column reactor 38 it is assumed that the biosorption of phosphorus by ags technology should successively pass three locations extracellular precipitation cell surface sorption and intracellular accumulation 43 whereas the first location of extracellular precipitation may relate to the external mass transfer emt and both the second and third locations of cell surface sorption and intracellular accumulation may relate to the internal mass transfer imt therefore the use of the mmtf models in this work can do to investigate the kinetics of mass transfer for the biosorption of phosphorous matter by ags in sbr such that 3 l n c o c s k l a g e β l n q t where k l a g is the global mass transfer factor h 1 β is the absorbate adsorbent affinity parameter g h mg 1 and t is the time of running the experimental h a deduction of eqn 3 can mathematically yield a linear equation 42 of 4 ln q 1 β ln t b with 5 b ln k l a g ln l n c o c s β where b is the potential mass transfer index related to driving force of mass transfer during the biosorption of phosphorous matter mg g 1 the correlation of emt factor to global mass transfer gmt factor can be expressed in form of the equation 42 6 k l a f k l a g e β l n q where k l a f is the external mass transfer factor h 1 the variation of k l a g to follow the c 0 c s ratio and that of k l a f to follow the q value can be determined using eqn 5 and eqn 6 respectively since both the values of β and b as shown in eqn 4 have been verified correctly on the straight line of plotting ln q versus ln t it is recognised that internal mass transfer imt factor is the difference between the factors of gmt and emt and thus can be expressed by the equation 42 of 7 k l a d k l a g k l a f where k l a d is the internal mass transfer factor h 1 the variation of k l a d can be determined using eqn 7 since the variation of k l a g and that of k l a f have been verified using eqn 5 and eqn 6 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the sequencing batch reactor the tp removal efficiency of sbr to treat pome would be dependent on many variances of process variables such as initial concentration and flow rate 44 the results fig 2 show that the variations of tp concentration from 14 to 91 mg p l 1 to have an average of 50 mg p l 1 see fig 2 line 1 and from 0 to 36 mg p l 1 to have an average of 15 mg p l 1 see fig 2 line 2 were verified at inlet and outlet of the sbr system respectively before the addition of serratia marcescens sa30 strain asm into the reactor the variations of tp concentration were verified from 33 to 105 mg p l 1 to have an average of 66 mg p l 1 see fig 2 line 1 and from 5 to 62 mg p l 1 to have an average of 29 mg p l 1 see fig 2 line 2 at inlet and outlet of the sbr system respectively after asm in the reactor the performance of sbr expressed in of tp removal varies from 18 to 100 to have an average of 65 without and from 18 to 93 to have an average of 53 with the presence of serratia marcescens sa30 strain see fig 2 line 3 after reaching steady state conditions from 16 to 98 d of the experimental run the sbr performance highly increases due the biological tp removal by ags technology induces into denitrifying and phosphate uptake under an anaerobic anoxic aerobic alternating operation 45 whereas the settling ags velocity of 81 m h 1 could be higher than the settling conventional activated sludge velocity of ranging from 7 8 to 12 2 m h 1 46 the accumulation of phosphorus predominantly caused by the mechanism of luxury uptake could be due to the biomass was not starved of phosphate 47 49 the efficiency of tp removal from 100 to 178 d of the experiment decreases due to the tp released by decomposer bacteria becomes part of the pool of inorganic phosphate in the reactor the tp release rate associated with volatile fatty acid uptake and sulfate reduction has been reported 50 while many factors such as nitrite ags and ph can significantly affect the anaerobic tp release and anoxic tp uptake by the sbr process 51 the development of ags without added serratia marcescens sa30 strain can accumulate a large amount of o g but only reduces a small amount of tp in spite of the organic contained phosphorous matters are biodegradable this indicates that a new approach that deals with the presence of serratia marcescens sa30 strain in the sbr is important the tp removal efficiency of sbr with the presence of serratia marcescens sa30 strain increases from 18 at 184 d to 93 at 250 d of the experimental run the role of bacterial matabolism to degrade o g may increase the efficiency of tp removal 36 due to a decrease in the water immiscible organic liquid interfacial tension may occur 52 3 2 analysis of straight line plotting data by plotting ln q versus ln t see fig 3 can be obtained a straight line with 1 β as slope and b as the y intercept where a very good fit to the experimental data was verified by the graph of straight line r 2 0 915 see table 3 using the values of b and β permit us to investigate the mass transfer kinetics of phosphorus biosorption by the ags development without and with the presence of serratia marcescens sa30 strain in the sbr biosorption of phosphorus by ags depends on the behaviour of phosphorus passing through three successive points of extracellular precipitation located outside of the biomass cell surface sorption located at interfacial water biomass and intracellular accumulation located within the biomass 43 therefore different environmental conditions related to the presence or absence of serratia marcescens sa30 strain in the sbr can affect the mass transfer kinetics of phosphorus biosorption and controls the efficiency of tp removal the value of β can increase from 1 96 g h mg 1 without to 48 54 g h mg 1 with the presence of serratia marcescens sa30 in the sbr in addition the value of b increases from 5 655 mg g 1 without to 9 776 mg g 1 with the presence of serratia marcescens sa30 in sbr see table 3 an increase in the values of β and b is due an intermittent cross link caused by the peptidoglycan in gram negative bacteria of serratia marcescens sa30 is thin which is approximately 15 20 of cell wall being peptidoglycan 53 biosorption mechanisms of phosphorus by ags may associate with active chemical groups and intracellular accumulation consisting the interactions by physical sorption ion exchange and chemical bond 54 both the cause and the mechanisms of phosphorus accumulated into ags need to be verified and thus can be investigated by the mmtf models to get a new insight on the external and internal mass transfer of transporting the phosphorous matters energetic heterogeneity can be associated with the presence of sorbing sites characterised with their typical chemical properties at the surface of ags and with the pores characterised with their typical geometries depending on the biosorption mechanism bacterial structure and bacterial surface characteristics 55 self immobilisation during the granulation process can result in cell structured shape which is characterised by a dense biomass of it 56 the cell wall of ags may compose many types of chemicals lipids polysaccharides and proteins which offer abundant functional groups like amino acids carboxyl hydroxyl and phosphate and also offer abundant hydrophobic adsorption sites like aliphatic carbon chains and aromatic rings 57 58 a high content of the cell surface hydrophobicity and polysaccharides may play a very important role in the formation of ags during the biosorption process in spite of the amount of polysaccharides available on the cell wall would be dependent on the typical species of bacteria and environmental growth conditions the removal of polysaccharides presented on the cell wall can be done by either simple mechanical disruption or chemical washing 59 3 3 kinetics of global external and internal mass transfer using the mmtf models permit us to investigate the kinetics of global and sequential mass transfers of both film mass transfer and mass diffusion within ags 38 42 by plotting the curves fig 4 of k l a versus t can provide the conformational variations of k l a g k l a f and k l a d pursuant to the time of running the experiment it is due to the different olrs of being connected with 50 of ver leading to a number of competitions affected the kinetics of mass transfer contribute to the overall reaction rate 60 the kinetic rates of gmt emt and imt for the biosorption of phosphorous matter by ags without and with the presence of serratia marcescens sa30 strain in the sbr can be evaluated using the trend in the values of k l a g k l a f and k l a d a zigzag pattern of k l a g and k l a d values is very similar from each other and stands very high compared to that of k l a f values whereas a zigzag pattern is due to olr entering the sbr varies empirical evidence verified that the values of k l a f are negligible compared to those of k l a d along the curves in fig 4a b leading to a conclusion that the resistance of mass transfer for phosphorus biosorption is dependent on emt therefore the transport of phosphorus from the bulk water to extracellular precipitation on the surface of ags is controlled by emt it is suggested that rate limiting step in the development of ags could be dependent on emt resistance because of the imt resistance and kinetic limitations of mass transfer are negligible in rolling the resistance of mass transfer 61 detail biosorption yields in the removal of phosphorus by ags technology affecting the imt rate can be investigated under two environmental conditions of without and with the presence of serratia marcescens sa30 strain in the sbr due to the strain of serratia marcescens sa30 has an important role in removing o g from pome by reducing oil water interfacial tension the primary concern of this study is to use the mmtf models for investigating the biosorption kinetics of tp removed by ags development from pome in the absence and presence of serratia marcescens sa30 strain in sbr 38 this attempts to gain a new knowledge on the applicability of the mmtf models and provides insights on the film mass transfer and mass diffusion within ags investigation of the response mechanisms and mass transfer kinetics by serratia marcescens sa30 strain in the accumulation of phosphorous matter into ags is important to get a depth understanding of the dynamic behaviours of mass transfer 21 62 the growth potential of ags toward the removal of tp from pome after adding the strain of serratia marcescens sa30 is higher than that before adding the strain of serratia marcescens sa30 effect of the exponential growth of serratia marcescens sa30 on imt could be very remarkable there is due to the presence of serratia marcescens sa30 in the sbr can stimulate the digestion of organic matter and the absorption of phosphorus from the extracellular precipitation to cellular tissue experimental evidence fig 4a b shows that the value of k l a d ranged from 12 48 to 260 94 h 1 with an average of 84 45 h 1 without added the serratia marcescens sa30 strain fig 4a is far lower than that ranged from 350 14 to 4604 78 h 1 with an average of 1642 12 h 1 with the presence of serratia marcescens sa30 strain in sbr fig 4b even though it provides the only one indicator of the reaction kinetics the effects of exponential growth of serratia marcescens sa30 and emulsification on the ags development can lead to a great motive force in the transport of phosphorous molecules to cell surface sorption from extracellular precipitation rapidly and then from cell surface sorption to intracellular accumulation growth potential of the biomass is much greater with the presence of serratia marcescens sa30 compared to that without the addition of serratia marcescens sa30 in sbr the role of the biosurfactants produced by serratia marcescens sa30 is an effective way to increase the phosphorous bioaccumulation to remarkably increasing the kinetic rate of imt a high rate of imt can accelarate the growth of granule and the yield of biomass and thus reduces the thickness membrane of bacterial cells leading to an increased sorption of cell surface 38 63 64 the role of serratia marcescens sa30 strain in the sbr may intracellularly stimulate the phosphorus sorption during the process of ags growth and produces the interfering biosurfactants which is able to regulate the bacterial metabolisms and growth of bacterial cells in response to environmental cues due to the presence of o g in the pome sample 65 this is the biological phenomena that contribute to the rate of imt differing by two environmental conditions of absence and presence of the serratia marcescens sa30 in the sbr see fig 4a b 3 4 correlation between global mass transfer and tp removal efficiency by plotting the curve fig 5 of e versus k l a g provides a logarithmically increasing trend line of the tp removal efficiency with increasing of the gmt factor according to the numerical simulation the maximum tp removal efficiency of 100 can be achieved when the value of k l a g is at 229 32 h 1 and when the experiment is setup without any of serratia marcescens sa30 strain in the sbr but takes long time see fig 5a as a result over 178 d of the treatment can be either continued to treat the pome with a low efficiency of the tp removal and less stable sbr operation or considered to propose other operating conditions by adding the strain of serratia marcescens sa30 in the sbr in spite of many types of microorganisms that naturally live with ags can grow and act to remove a certain amount of tp from pome 66 the rate of gmt in the formation of ags could be dependent on the solubility of other elements and the positive influence of certain microorganisms fig 5b shows that the sbr performance to remove the phosphorous matter can reach at approximately 93 of its maximum efficiency when the process of pome treatment supported by the presence of serratia marcescens sa30 in the sbr was carried out when the value of k l a g reaches at 4604 78 h 1 since the multiplication rate of exponential serratia marcescens sa30 growth produces a large amount of the biosurfactants this can reduce the oil water interfacial tension 38 67 and greatly affects the gmt rate the presence of the biosurfactants in sbr can boost bacterial metabolism and acts independently from biotic and abiotic environmental factors 68 69 therefore the addition of serratia marcescens sa30 in the sbr can do the role to stimulate the development of ags and consequently leads to a logarithmically increase in the efficiency of tp removal during 144 d of the experiment 4 conclusions in this work the mmtf models were used to determine the gmt emt and imt factors for investigating the phosphorous biosorption by ags technology from pome in the sbr the data of monitoring the tp concentrations collected at inlet and outlet of the sbr treatment system can be analysed to get better understanding on two different environmental conditions of modelling and simulation to determine the kinetics of global external and internal mass transfer based on the values of k l a g k l a f and k l a d respectively a zigzag pattern of the values of k l a g and k l a d is very similar to each other and is much higher than that of the values of k l a f to most likely due to every 1 l pome sample entering the sbr could be characterised by its typical amount of the tp concentration and also typical olr the phosphorous biosorption by ags technology in the sbr is controlled by the resistance of emt the sbr performance to remove a certain amount of tp from pome has been verified to logarithmically increase with increasing of the gmt rate and may contribute to designing the further sbr treatment system declaration of competing interest all the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgment the

14371,catalytic ozonation of 2 4 6 tribromophenol 2 4 6 tbp in aqueous media conducted in the presence of 10 20 and 30 co loaded on fe by co precipitation co ppt and a simple physical mixing method mixed is compared to ozonation alone in ozonation alone only 40 of 2 4 6 tbp was converted while 11 of toc was removed from water the surface characteristics of the catalysts material determined by bet nh3 tpd sem and point zero charge pzc measurements revealed that the fe co co ppt catalyst exhibited superior quality compared to fe co mixed catalyst material hence contributing to higher catalytic activity for debromination of 2 4 6 tbp toc removal and organic by product org bp minimization however it was unable to effectively limit bromate formation during ozonation nh3 tpd and pzc measurements showed that fe co co ppt catalyst contained more acidic sites than fe co mixed catalyst hence contributing to higher ozone decomposition to hydroxyl radicals fe co mixed catalyst was more effective in inhibiting bromate formation with 9 1 fe co co ppt catalyst 39 of toxic bromate was formed during ozonation while in the presence of 9 1 fe co mixed catalyst a significant drop in bromate yield to 5 was achieved a reaction pathway showing partial inhibition of bromate ion during catalytic ozonation in water is proposed keywords 2 4 6 tribromophenol bromate minimization organic by products catalytic ozonation point zero charge 1 introduction out of all the man made chemicals used in the world halogenated organic compounds hoc s have received the greatest scientific attention because they are dominant groundwater pollutants and are significant constituents of hazardous wastes and landfill run offs they are mainly used in the manufacture of insecticides refrigerator coolants fire retardants industrial solvents degreasing agents and in organic synthesis hoc s pose a threat to the environment because of their high toxic nature incomplete degradation and ability to easily transform into more poisonous org bp s 1 2 when hoc s degrade they form smaller org bp s which are sometimes extremely far more hazardous than the original substance the most hazardous and persistent hoc s comprise of semi volatile chlorinated and brominated aromatic compounds which combine with other substances and then find their way into water and food 3 these toxic hoc s frequently released from industrial commercial and agricultural sources contain one to three halogen atoms attached to carbon atoms of the numerous semi volatile hoc s present in water the degradation and toxicity of most have been extensively researched however attention have been largely concentrated on the chlorinated compounds 4 7 while the complex brominated aromatic compounds have not been well explored furthermore most of these studies did not consider the fate of the bromide ion released during the debromination reaction in aqueous media which due to its high reactivity with strong oxidising agents lead to the formation of carcinogenic bromate ions 8 ozone being one of the strongest oxidants is used extensively in water treatment processes has showed great ability to oxidize a number of organic and inorganic substances however ozonation alone is ineffective to completely remove the persistant organic pollutants and sometimes generate toxic org bp s 9 10 its low solubility in water combined with its costly preparation and inability to completely oxidise organic compounds in water can make its implementation economically unfeasible 11 another limiting factor is its poor stability in the reaction medium which is highly dependent on solution ph since hydroxide ions initiate the decomposition of ozone molecules a more serious problem arises during ozonation of waters containing bromide ions which can readily oxidise to carcinogenic bromate ions 12 bromate once formed in water is difficult to remove and current methods for bromate minimization during ozonation are found to be somewhat impractical and costly 13 therefore there is a need to research new methods to reduce bromate formation during ozonation this work hence demonstrates how a fe co metal oxide catalyst prepared by physical mixing can be used effectively to minimize bromate formation during ozonation of bromide containing waters in recent years the use of solid catalyst materials in ozonation processes have become popular because of their high effectiveness and improvement of water quality 14 efficiency of the catalytic ozonation process depends on the choice of catalytic material its surface characteristics and the ph of the water all influencing ozone decomposition and substrate conversion occurring on the active sites of the catalyst surface 15 heterogeneous catalysts made of metal oxides mixed metal oxides supported and unsupported metals are the most frequently used materials for ozone initiated oxidation of organic pollutants in wastewater their increased resistance to change minimum loss and superior activity can have a positive effect on the decomposition of ozone thereby accelerating the destruction of many contaminants in wastewater 16 18 they have an added advantage of being easily recycled and reused without further treatment however many of these catalytic materials are prepared using transition or rare metals and their toxicity and exorbitant cost are major limitations for industrial applications iron and its salts on the other hand are less costly and a more environmentally friendly materials and more importantly are available in abundance 19 however in spite of these advantages iron is still understated in the field of catalysis compared to other transition metals 20 limited literature reports have shown iron and iron based materials been applied to wastewater treatment processes for the removal of various hazardous compounds 21 23 this study therefore evaluates and compares the conversion and mineralization of 2 4 6 tbp a potential environmental toxic pollutant found in water 24 by ozone alone and catalytic ozonation in the presence of fe doped with co by co precipitation and a simple physical mixing method the main objective of the work is to provide a strategy for bromate minimization during catalytic ozonation of bromide containing water this is achieved by monitoring the extent of i bromide bromate and ii org bp formation during the ozonation of 2 4 6 tbp 2 experimental 2 1 sample preparation since the solubility 2 4 6 tbp is 50 ppm in water at 25 c a 50 ppm stock solution of 2 4 6 tribromophenol 99 ar grade sigma aldrich prepared by mixing 0 05 g of the solid in milli q water in a 1 dm3 volumetric flask was used for this study 2 2 catalyst preparation all chemicals used to prepare the catalyst material were of analytical grade purchased from merck sa fe alone was used as a reference and fe combined with 10 20 and 30 co was used for the mixed metal oxides the following two methods were used to prepare the mixed metal oxide catalysts 2 2 1 co precipitation method referred to as co ppt catalyst for each catalyst each salt was accurately weighed out separately according to amounts shown in table a1 and dissolved in 200 cm3 of deionized water the resulting solutions were then transferred into separate 500 cm3 separating funnels each salt solution was then added dropwise from each separating funnel to 250 cm3 of a 1 mol dm3 na2co3 solution contained in a 2 dm3 beaker with vigorous stirring over a period of 4 5 h required amounts of 0 1 mol dm3 naoh solution was introduced intermittently to maintain the ph of the metal salt mixture between 9 and 11 after addition of all the salt solution to the beaker it was left to stand for about 1 h the resultant precipitate was filtered and washed thoroughly with deionized water until filtrate was clear it was then dried at 100 c for 1 h and calcined as previously reported 21 23 in the presence of air in a muffle furnace set at 500 c for 5 h 2 2 2 physical mixing method referred to as mixed catalyst weighed out each salt according to table a1 in a porcelain crucible and mixed thoroughly to obtain a homogeneous mix the crucible was then placed in a muffle furnace set at 500 c for 5 h all catalyst materials were finely ground and passed through a 200 mesh sieve to achieve comparable particle size afterward they were stored in a dry vacuum oven for further investigation 2 3 catalyst characterization fe co co ppt and fe co mixed catalyst material was characterized as follows i scanning electron microscope sem measurements giving information about morphology and location of metallic species on catalyst surface was carried out using a joel jsm 6100 microscope equipped with an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer edx fitted with a tungsten filament the images were taken with an emission current of 100 μa and an accelerator voltage of 12 kv ii the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of each catalyst was carried out at 77 k on a micromeritics gemini 2360 automated single multiple point bet surface area analyser the surface area pore size distribution pore volume and average pore diameter were determined by the bjh method iii the point of zero charge pzc was estimated using a potentiometric titration method 25 and iv temperature programmed desorption tpd studies with nh3 was conducted using the autochem 2910 micromeritics usa instrument fitted with a thermal conductivity detector a 50 mg catalyst sample was pre treated by passing helium over it at a flow rate of 50 cm3 min and 200 c for 2 h it was then saturated with 10 ammonia further flushed with helium and thereafter placed in a u shaped quartz sample tube tpd analysis was conducted from ambient temperature to 800 c at a heating rate of 10 c min 2 4 ozonation procedure ozone gas was generated by passing 200 cm3 min medical grade oxygen 99 9 purity through the electric discharge unit of an ozonox lab 7000 ozonator instrument an ozone concentration of 100 ppm achieved with a generator current of 0 42 a was used for all experiments the concentration of ozone in each experiment was measured by using the iodometric method by bubbling the ozone gas into a ki solution and then titrating the liberated iodine with standard thiosulphate solution with starch as indicator 26 the ozone reaction was carried out in a 100 cm3 cylindrical glass reactor equipped with a sintered porous ceramic gas diffuser located at the bottom of the reactor to produce fine bubbles and a small magnetic stirrer to ensure homogeneous mixing of ozone the catalyst and the aqueous substrate mixture preliminary experiments showed that ozone reacts very fast with 2 4 6 tbp in water therefore ozonation times of 5 10 15 and 20 min were chosen for this work ozone gas was continuously bubbled at room temperature for the required time interval into 25 cm3 aqueous solution of 50 ppm 2 4 6 tbp containing 0 1 g catalyst material all experiments were performed in triplicate the experimental set up for this work is shown in fig 1 to confirm the presence of ozone catalyst surface reactions experiments were conducted to study the extent of ozone decomposition in water during ozonation alone and ozonation in the presence of fe co co ppt and fe co mixed catalyst water samples in the absence of 2 4 6 tbp but containing only 0 1 g of each catalyst was ozonated for 5 10 15 and 25 min respectively pure water ozonated for the same time intervals were used as control the concentration of the excess ozone trapped in ki solution was then determined by titration with standard thiosulphate solution 2 5 instrumental analysis a hplc method was developed and validated to monitor the percentage conversion of 2 4 6 tbp as a function of ozone treatment time using a shimadzu 20a high performance liquid chromatograph fitted with a variable wavelength uv detector and a waters novapak silica 4 μm column 3 9 mm i d and 150 mm length maintained at 30 c the system was run on isocratic mode using a filtered and degassed mobile phase solution of 60 40 v v methanol water set at a flow rate of 1 cm3 min linearity of the hplc instrument was confirmed by injecting various standard solutions 2 4 6 tbp prepared by serial dilution of a 50 ppm 2 4 6 tbp stock solution detailed instrument parameters and calibration data are presented in figure a1 the total organic carbon toc was determined the method proposed by hach 27 a 10 cm3 sample was first sparged under slightly acidic conditions ph 2 to remove inorganic carbon the organic carbon was then digested in a drb 20 cod reactor with persulphate powder and acid to form carbon dioxide the carbon dioxide was then allowed to diffuse into a ph indicator reagent contained in an ampule to form carbonic acid the coloured solution was then measured using a dr 1900 portable spectrophotometer at a wavelength setting of 430 nm the amount of colour change is related to the parts per million of organic carbon present in the sample calibration of the spectrophotometer was carried out by using a 1000 ppm potassium acid phthalate standard solution the concentration of bromide bromate and low molecular weight organic acids was determined by injecting 20 μl of each ozonated sample into a metrohm 761 compact ion chromatograph ic fitted with a conductivity detector and a metrohm asupp 5 250 4 0 column the eluent used was a mixture of 3 2 mm na2co3 and 1 0 mm nahco3 maintained at a flow rate of 0 5 cm3 min a 50 mm h2so4 solution served as the suppressor reagent bromide bromate and low molecular weight organic ar grade standards purchased from merck sa was used to check linearity and calibrate the ic instrument conductivity of each solution before and after ozonation was measured by a calibrated conductivity meter the ph of the substrate solution before and after ozonation was measured at room temperature using a metrohm combined ph glass electrode pt 1000 calibration of the conductivity and ph electrode was conducted prior to sample measurements 3 results and discussion 3 1 percent conversion and toc removal in heterogeneous catalytic ozonation systems the use of mixed metal oxides was found to improve both adsorption of organic compounds and the production of hydroxyl radicals chemisorption of the organic substrate on the surface of the catalyst is thought to be one of the essential steps for the catalytic reaction once absorbed organic molecules are then degraded by molecular ozone and or by hydroxyl radicals 28 this part of the study therefore investigates the effect of cobalt content on catalytic activity of co loaded on fe prepared by ii co precipitation co ppt and ii physical mixing mixed fig 2 shows percent conversion of 2 4 6 tbp and toc removed as a function of time for ozonation alone and catalytic ozonation with 10 and 30 co loaded on fe respectively the data indicates that conversion of 2 4 6 tbp by ozone alone is significantly lower compared to catalytic ozonation with fe co co ppt and fe co mixed in ozonation alone only 40 of substrate was converted and 11 of toc was removed after 20 min of ozone treatment in the presence of fe conversion of 2 4 6 tbp increased marginal to 54 while 15 of toc was removed after 20 min of ozonation these results reveal that ozonation alone or ozonation in the presence of fe alone is a slow process and is therefore not suitable for effective conversion and mineralization of 2 4 6 tbp in water when 2 4 6 tbp was ozonated in the presence of co alone only 41 of substrate was converted and 10 toc was removed after 20 min indicating that co alone has insignificant influence on degradation of 2 4 6 tbp when compared to ozonation alone therefore no further tests were conducted with co alone when co was loaded on fe by co precipitation a significant increase in substrate conversion and toc removal was achieved a co loading of 10 on fe resulted in 86 conversion and 45 toc removal after 20 min of ozone treatment when the co loading on fe was increased to 20 conversion of the target compound increased to 94 and toc removal further increased to 49 after 20 min a 30 co loading on fe resulted in complete conversion of 2 4 6 tbp after 20 min while 58 of the total carbon was successfully mineralized compared to ozonation alone fe co co ppt catalytic ozonation showed a significant improvement in conversion of 2 4 6 tbp but more importantly a higher percentage of carbon was successfully removed from the substrate solution in the case of fe co mixed catalyst a significant drop in 2 4 6 tbp conversion and toc removal efficiency was noted for all co loadings the fe co mixed catalyst is not as effective as the fe co co ppt catalyst in converting 2 4 6 tbp and removing toc from the water however it was more effective than ozonation alone in catalytic ozonation with 9 1 fe co mixed a 30 drop in substrate conversion was observed compared to ozonation with 9 1 fe co co ppt catalyst and only 16 of the total carbon converted was removed after 20 min of ozone treatment ozonation in the presence of 8 2 fe co mixed catalyst resulted in a 34 drop in substrate conversion and only 19 of toc removed after 20 min in ozonation with 7 3 fe co mixed catalyst a 35 drop in substrate conversion was noted compared to ozonation with 7 3 fe co co ppt catalyst and only 21 of the total carbon converted was removed after 20 min of ozone treatment the results indicate that catalytic activity is severely affected when co is combined with fe by physical mixing resulting in lower substrate conversion and poor toc removal catalytic activity of the used catalyst was examined by conducting a second cycle of ozone experiments in the presence of the used catalyst it was found for all experiments that the percent conversion of 2 4 6 tbp and toc removal during the second ozonation cycle compared favourably with the first cycle thus confirming stable catalytic activity data for the textural properties of the two types of catalyst material shown in table 1 revealed different surface characteristics which can explain and support the superior catalytic activity of fe co co ppt compared to fe co mixed catalyst the data in table 1 indicate that the surface characteristics of the fe co co ppt catalyst material is better than both the fe co mixed and undoped fe catalyst material when 10 co is loaded on fe by co precipitation a significant increase in surface area occurred an increase in co loadings on fe resulted in a further increase in surface area and pore volume while a drop in average pore size was observed this could be attributed to the even distribution of co on fe during co precipitation which is confirmed by sem monographs shown in fig 3 these improvements to the catalyst surface properties significantly contributed to the higher catalytic activity of fe co co ppt for conversion of 2 4 6 tbp and toc removal from water by ozonation in contrast the fe co catalyst sythesized by physical mixing resulted in a much smaller surface area thus displayed reduced catalytic activity and hence poor conversion of 2 4 6 tbp and toc removal from water during ozonation the sem monographs of fe co co ppt and fe co mixed shown in fig 3 reveals that the fe co mixed catalyst surface is non uniform which is due to the formation of clusters of fe co o with significantly smaller surface area and large cavities whereas the fe co co ppt surface exhibits relatively more homogeneous and fine pore morphology with relatively larger surface area which enhances catalytic activity in water during ozonation a variation in ph as a function of ozone treatment time at different reaction conditions is illustrated in table 2 the data shows that in all cases the ph of the ozonated solution decreases as ozonation time increases which may be due to the formation of organic and or inorganic acidic products also evident is that with fe co mixed the initial solution ph is much lower than with fe co co ppt at lower ph 2 4 6 tbp is degraded by molecular ozone while at alkaline ph the hydroxyl radicals played an important role in the degradation process 29 alkaline medium facilitates hydroxyl radical generation which favoured the degradation process due to its higher oxidative power than ozone while at acidic to neural ph ozone is more stable in solution furthermore hydroxyl radicals reduces the ozone lifetime in aqueous media hence higher ozone decomposition is achieved 30 there could be two other reasons which are dependent on the solution ph for the improved conversion of 2 4 6 tbp and toc removal during fe co co ppt catalytic ozonation compared to fe co mixed catalytic ozonation firstly in the presence of fe co co ppt catalyst since the initial solution ph is significantly higher than the pka of 2 4 6 tbp 31 we would expect the organic substrate to exist mostly as the 2 4 6 tribromophenolate ion as illustrated in fig 4 this ion due to its negative end would react much faster with ozone compared to molecular 2 4 6 tbp itself thus leading to improved degradation however in fe co mixed the initial solution ph was slightly lower than the pka of 2 4 6 tbp meaning that more of it existed in the molecular form hence poorer degradation by ozone secondly coox are thought to be the main active sites to affect the decomposition of ozone and formation of surface hydroxyl groups 32 this indicates that the loading of co onto fe by co precipitation increases the number of surface hydroxyl groups which enhances ozone decomposition to form hydroxyl radicals thereby leading to increased conversion of substrate molecule the pattern of 2 4 6 tbp conversion and toc removal suggests that the presence of co forms surface active sites on the iron based catalyst 33 and when the co content on fe is increased the number of surface active sites also increases thus enhancing the production of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals when the fe co surface is in contact with water it generally becomes hydrated forming a monolayer of surface hydroxyl groups these groups can either become protonated or deprotonated as illustrated in scheme 1 depending on the quantity of hydrogen and hydroxyl ions present when the concentration of the f e c o o surface charges is equal to the concentration of the f e c o o h 2 surface charges there will therefore be a net zero charge on the catalyst surface referred to as the point of zero charge pzc for this reason the initial solution ph is an important factor to consider during fe co catalytic ozonation in water since it can greatly influence the surface charge characteristics of the fe co catalyst the pzc values determined experimentally by potentiometric titration for 10 and 30 co loadings in fe co co ppt and fe co mixed is illustrated in fig 5 the pzc of fe co co ppt is much higher than that of fe co mixed indicating that fe co co ppt has more f e c o o h 2 sites furthermore in the presence of 9 1 fe co co ppt catalyst the initial ph of the substrate solution was 9 1 much lower than its pzc value of 10 2 meaning that the catalyst surface will now generate more positively charged f e c o o h 2 sites 34 the increase in the number of positively charged sites on the catalyst surface is advantageous during ozonation since ozone due to its strong polar nature 35 will show a higher affinity for adsorption by the negative end onto the positive catalyst surface thus leading to enhanced decomposition and generation of h o radicals as illustrated in scheme 2 these released h o radicals will then rapidly debrominate the 2 4 6 tbp molecule to form the hydroxylated intermediate by product and large quantities of bromide ions which is responsible for the sharp increase in solution conductivity from 3 μs cm to 180 μs cm therefore conversion of 2 4 6 tbp in fe co co ppt catalytic ozonation primarily occurs via h o radicals formed during ozone catalyst surface interactions in the case of 9 1 fe co mixed catalyst a lower pzc value of 5 1 was obtained suggesting the presence of excess f e c o o sites on the catalyst surface the number of negative sites increases with an increase in solution ph the metal oxide then behaves as a strong bronsted base and a cation exchanger the lower conversion and toc removal in 9 1 fe co mixed catalyst may suggest that ozone molecule has a poor affinity towards these negative sites hence poor decomposition of ozone into hydroxyl radicals fig 6 illustrates the extent of ozone decomposition in water in the absence of 2 4 6 tbp for ozonation alone and ozonation in the presence of fe co co ppt and fe co mixed catalyst the results indicate that ozone decomposition in water alone is poor with only 14 decomposed and solution ph decreasing initially from 7 02 to 5 71 after 20 min of ozonation however in the presence of fe co co ppt catalyst o 3 decomposition is significantly improved ozonation of water in the presence of 9 1 fe co co ppt resulted in 40 of o 3 decomposing and solution ph decreasing initially from 9 48 to 8 92 after 20 min which was lower than 10 20 the pzc value of 9 1 fe co co ppt catalyst in the presence of 7 3 fe co co ppt 60 of o 3 was successfully decomposed with solution ph decreasing initially from 8 30 to 8 10 after 20 min which was lower than 9 00 the pzc value of 7 3 fe co co ppt catalyst in the case of fe co mixed catalyst ozone decomposition was found to be much lower that is in the presence of 9 1 fe co mixed 20 of o 3 was decomposed and solution ph decreased from 6 04 to 5 37 but higher than 5 10 the pzc value of 9 1 fe co mixed catalyst in the case of 7 3 fe co mixed catalyst only 35 of o 3 was decomposed and solution ph decreased from 5 25 to 4 63 also higher than 4 00 the pzc value of 7 3 fe co mixed catalyst the results confirm that decomposition of ozone by fe co catalytic ozonation occurs on the fe co positive and or negative sites through adsorption and generation of h o radicals furthermore ozone decomposition is favoured when the solution ph is high and below the pzc value of the fe co catalyst therefore the conversion of 2 4 6 tbp in water and mineralization of the converted carbon by fe co co ppt catalytic ozonation is primarily due to h o radical oxidation reactions while ozonation with fe co mixed catalyst is dominated by molecular o 3 reactions to confirm the presence of acidic sites on the fe co catalyst surface nh3 tpd analysis was conducted for each catalyst material the nh3 tpd profiles illustrated in fig 7 shows that an increase in co loading on fe from 10 to 30 resulted in an increase in ammonia desorption for both types of catalyst material however the overall acidity is higher for fe co co ppt than fe co mixed catalyst material the total acidity for 7 3 fe co co ppt was 10 cm3 g stp while the acidity for the 7 3 fe co mixed catalyst material was only 1 3 cm3 g stp furthermore the tcd signal and peak area for 30 co loaded on fe is larger than 10 co loaded on fe indicating a higher concentration of acidic sites on the 7 3 fe co catalyst surface these acidic sites improve adsorption desorption of ozone leading to enhanced decomposition into hydroxyl radicals this behaviour is consistent with the results obtained for the decomposition of o 3 illustrated in fig 6 the fe co co ppt catalyst show two well separated peaks at 690 c and 780 c suggesting two types of acidic sites the lower temperature peak is an indication of slightly weaker bond strength and hence slightly weaker acidic sites 36 fe co mixed catalyst only has one peak at 592 c suggesting the existence of one type of acidic site evenly distributed on the catalyst surface a further observation is that nh3 desorption from fe co co ppt occurs at a higher temperature and from fe co mixed catalyst it occurs at a lower temperature which indicates that fe co co ppt has a higher population of stronger acidic sites these strong acidic sites result in improved catalytic activity leading to more effective deprotonation reactions producing hydroxyl radicals an excess of these hydroxyl radicals then results in an improvement in 2 4 6 tbp conversion and toc removal from water 3 2 oxidation of bromide to bromate ion chromatographic results for the catalytic ozonation of 2 4 6 tbp in water with fe alone and co loaded on fe by co precipitation showed the generation of large amounts of b r and b r o 3 ions as major products and the yield of these ions gradually increased with an increase in ozone treatment time furthermore conductivity measurements of the ozonated 2 4 6 tbp water mixtures showed a steady increase from 3 μs cm to 121 μs cm signifying b r and b r o 3 ion formation illustrations a and b in fig 8 shows the variation in percentage yield of b r and b r o 3 ions formed during ozonation alone and catalytic ozonation in the presence of fe and fe co co ppt measured at uncontrolled solution ph it is evident that in ozonation alone both b r and b r o 3 yields are low however when co is loaded on fe by co precipitation a significant amount of b r o 3 ions was produced in ozonation alone only 14 of bromate ions were formed however in the presence of 10 co loaded on fe by co precipitation 39 of b r o 3 was formed after 20 min of ozone treatment increasing the co loading on fe to 20 lowered the yield of b r o 3 slightly to 35 a further increase in the co loading on fe to 30 saw a further but marginal drop in yield of b r o 3 to 31 after 20 min of ozone treatment this pattern of b r o 3 formation indicates that its formation is influenced by the presence of co ie when the co content of the fe co co ppt catalyst is increased the yield of b r o 3 ions slightly decreases for the same time intervals the yield of b r ion showed a gradual increase as the co content of the catalyst material was increased one possible reason for the slight decrease in the bromide to bromate oxidation rate could be due to the drop in the solution ph during ozone treatment table 2 since b r o 3 formation is inhibited as solution ph decreases 37 for example in the presence of 10 co the initial solution ph was 9 10 and after 20 min of ozone treatment it dropped to 8 54 similarly in the presence of 30 co solution ph dropped from an initial value of 8 00 to 7 57 after 20 min as the solution ph gets closer to 8 80 the pka of the h o b r o b r system more hydronium ions are present causing the h o b r o b r equilibrium system to shift to the left thereby favouring h o b r formation since h o b r is not easily oxidised to bromate by ozone 38 therefore a lower yield of bromate ion is expected when solution ph is greater than 8 80 the pka of the h o b r o b r system more hydroxide ions are present resulting in a decrease of hydronium ions the h o b r o b r equilibrium system to shift to the right thus favouring the formation of o b r which reacts more readily with o 3 to form b r o 3 an illustration of the reaction pathways is shown in scheme 3 therefore b r oxidation to b r o 3 is more favourable in fe co co ppt catalytic ozonation compared to ozonation alone since its solution ph is higher than 8 80 compared to ozonation alone another reason for the higher yield of b r o 3 ion formation during fe co co ppt catalytic ozonation is due to the rapid oxidation of b r by ozone itself and or by h o radicals the fe co co ppt catalytic ozonation system provides the alkaline medium for ozone to readily react with excess hydroxide ions and also interact with the surface active acidic sites of the fe co co ppt catalyst to produce h o radicals fig 9 illustrates variation in percentage yield of b r and b r o 3 ions formed during ozonation alone and catalytic ozonation in the presence of fe and co loaded onto fe by physical mixing a notable observation here is that when co is loaded on fe by physical mixing a significant drop in yield of b r o 3 ions was detected compared to ozonation alone and ozonation in the presence of fe co co ppt catalyst when 10 co was loaded on fe by physical mixing only 5 of b r o 3 was formed after 20 min of ozone treatment increasing the co loading on fe to 20 resulted in a slight increase in the yield of b r o 3 to 7 after 20 min of ozonation a further increase in the co loading on fe to 30 saw a further but marginal increase in yield of b r o 3 to 8 after 20 min it is further observed that for all cobalt loadings on iron a large quantity of b r ions was detected indicating that the rate of oxidation of b r to b r o 3 by ozone in the presence of fe co mixed is significantly reduced this pattern of bromide to bromate formation could be explained by considering the initial solution ph in the presence of fe co mixed catalyst firstly since the initial solution ph in all cases table 2 is much higher than the pzc value of the fe co mixed catalyst fig 5 it would mean that the catalyst surface will consist mostly of negative f e c o active sites these sites will tend to repel the negatively charged bromide ions preventing the oxidation of bromide to bromate ions on the catalyst surface and hence a lower yield of bromate ions secondly the initial solution ph in all cases is much lower than 8 8 the pka of the hobr obr system more hydronium ions are present causing the h o b r o b r equilibrium system to shift to the left thereby favouring h o b r formation and since reactivity of hobr with ozone is poor a lower yield of bromate ion is obtained to evaluate the effectiveness of the fe co co ppt and fe co mixed catalyst material to minimize bromate formation in water a 10 ppm bromide solution was ozonated in the presence of each catalyst material the results of these experiments are shown in fig 10 it is evident that the pattern of bromide to bromate oxidation by catalytic ozonation is similar to that obtained in the presence of 2 4 6 tbp in ozonation alone only 5 7 ppm of the 10 ppm bromide ions were converted to bromate and solution ph decreased initially from 6 82 to 6 01 after 10 min of ozone treatment however in the presence of 10 co loaded on fe by co precipitation the bromide was completely oxidised to bromate while solution ph decreased marginally from 8 84 to 8 32 after 10 min of ozonation increasing the co loading on fe to 30 lowered the yield of b r o 3 to 6 52 ppm and solution ph decreased initially from 8 12 to 7 66 after 10 min of ozone treatment the results confirm that i oxidation of b r to b r o 3 during ozonation with fe co co ppt decreases as co content of the catalyst is increased and ii b r o 3 formation is minimized as solution ph decreases in the case of fe co mixed catalyst a lower yield of b r o 3 ions was achieved when compared to both ozonation alone and ozonation in the presence of fe co co ppt when 10 of co was combined with fe by physical mixing only 2 ppm of bromate was formed after 10 min of ozone treatment and solution ph decreased initially from 5 55 to 5 31 increasing the co content of the fe co mixed catalyst to 30 increases the yield of bromate marginally to 3 ppm with solution ph decreasing initially from 5 10 to 4 87 after 10 min of ozone treatment the low solution ph caused by the presence of fe co mixed catalyst minimizes the oxidation of b r to b r o 3 during ozonation 3 3 formation of organic by products ozonation processes applied in water treatment to remove toxic compounds can sometimes lead to the production of more toxic by products one study has reported that org bp yield increases as a function of ozone dosage and or ozonation time 39 whereas another has shown that a further increase in ozonation time can decrease the org bp yield 40 therefore it is essential to monitor and find ways to minimize the generation of org bp s during ozonation of 2 4 6 tbp in water two organic acids namely formic and acetic acids were identified as major intermediate products table 3 compares the yield based on mass balance of carbon in mol of org bp s organic acids formic and acetic acids and toc removed after 20 min for i ozonation alone ii ozonation in the presence of fe and iii ozonation in the presence of 10 20 and 30 co loaded on fe prepared by i co precipitation and ii physical mixing it is evident from table 3 that ozonation of 2 4 6 tbp in different reaction conditions produces a significant amount of organic acids and org bp s in ozonation alone of the 40 of the total carbon converted only 9 was removed and 31 remained in solution of this amount 19 existed as org bp s and 12 existed as short chain carboxylic acids formic and acetic acids the high percentage of org bp formation suggest that ozonation alone is ineffective to oxidize most of the org bp s to carboxylic acids hence leading to poor mineralization in the case of 100 fe a similar trend was observed however the yields were slightly higher therefore indicating that ozonation of the substrate solution with fe is also not favoured for oxidation of org bp s and successive carboxylic acid mineralization when co was loaded on fe by co precipitation yield of org bp s dropped significantly compared to ozonation alone and a considerable amount of toc was removed in the presence of 9 1 fe co co ppt of the 86 of the total carbon converted 57 was removed and 29 remained in solution of this amount only 12 formed org bp s and 17 was present as short chain carboxylic acids in 8 2 fe co co ppt of the 94 carbon converted 59 of was successfully removed and 35 remained in solution of which 10 formed org bp s and 25 formed carboxylic acids increasing the co content of the catalyst material to 30 produced similar results in 7 3 fe co co ppt of all the organic carbon converted 74 was removed from the water through mineralization and only 26 was left in solution only 6 of this carbon formed org bp s and the balance existed as organic acids the trend in these results show that when co is used as a dopant on fe during catalytic ozonation a significant amount of org bp s is converted to short chain carboxylic acids followed by mineralization to carbon dioxide when the co loading on fe is increased a significant drop in org bp formation occurs and an improvement in mineralization of organic acids is evident a 30 co loading on fe showed optimum activity for org bp minimization and carboxylic acid mineralization during catalytic ozonation of 2 4 6 tbp in aqueous media the data obtained for catalytic ozonation of 2 4 6 tbp in aqueous media with co combined with fe by physical mixing is listed in table 3 the pattern of carbon transformation in the presence of fe co mixed is different in comparison to ozonation with fe co co ppt catalyst in fe co mixed catalyst toc removal was found to be significantly lower and a large amount of organic carbon still remained in solution however when the co loading on fe was increased a marginal increase in toc removal was observed a major limitation is that the yield of org bp s were relatively high with fe co mixed catalyst which is undesirable for the ozonation treatment process fig 11 compares the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of various loadings of co on fe prepared by co precipitation co ppt and by mixing mixed both types of catalyst material show a type iv isotherm with a type h3 hysteresis loop which indicates a mesoporous structure 41 fe co co ppt catalyst resulted in a slightly broader hysteresis loop ranging from 0 40 to 0 99 of the relative pressure while the hysteresis loop of fe co mixed for all co loadings is much narrower starting at 0 70 and ending at 0 99 suggesting a less porous structure and hence a smaller surface area and pore volume 42 the poor surface characteristics of the fe co mixed catalyst material is further indication of its poor activity which could be the reason for its poor removal of org bp s from water during ozonation although both fe co co ppt and fe co mixed catalyst material show similar types of isotherms however the quantity of nitrogen adsorbed was significantly different nitrogen adsorption on both catalyst material showed an increasing trend with co loadings on fe but the fe co co ppt catalyst showed higher nitrogen adsorption than the fe co mixed catalyst material for all co loadings this pattern of surface behaviour suggests that fe co co ppt has more superior catalytic activity than fe co mixed to minimize org bp formation during ozonation of 2 4 6 tbp in water 4 conclusion heterogeneous catalytic ozonation of toxic 2 4 6 tbp in water with co fe co ppt catalyst material showed significant improvement in conversion and toc removal compared to ozonation alone increasing the co loading on fe from 10 to 30 enhanced debromination of the toxic substrate and subsequent toc removal from water when 30 of co was loaded on fe complete conversion of 2 4 6 tbp was achieved and 58 of the total carbon converted was successfully mineralized after 20 min of ozone treatment catalytic activity was severely affected when co was combined with fe by physical mixing resulting in a significant drop in substrate conversion and toc removal efficiency in fe co co ppt catalyst the original ph of the substrate solution was much lower than its pzc value causing hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface to become positively charged which then attracts the negative end of the ozone molecule hence enhancing decomposition and increasing generation of h o radicals in the case of fe co mixed catalyst a lower pzc value was obtained resulting in presence of excess negative sites on the catalyst surface hence leading to poor substrate conversion and toc removal catalytic ozonation with co loaded on fe by co precipitation resulted in the generation of large amount of carcinogenic bromate ions much higher than in ozonation alone however the drop in solution ph with increasing co loadings on fe caused the yield of bromate ions to decrease slightly the fe co mixed catalyst preparation method was simple and less time consuming compared to the fe co co ppt catalyst preparation method and it showed potential to minimize bromate formation more effectively compared to ozonation alone and ozonation with fe co co ppt catalyst ozonation alone was ineffective to oxidize most of the org bp s to carboxylic acids hence resulting in poor mineralization increasing the co loading on fe from 10 to 30 caused a significant drop in org bp formation and improvement in mineralization of organic acids the trend in the results show that when co is used as a dopant on fe during catalytic ozonation a significant amount of org bp s is converted to carboxylic acids followed by mineralization to carbon dioxide with fe co mixed catalyst toc removal was found to be significantly lower that is a large amount of organic carbon still remained in solution a major limitation is that the yield of org bp was relatively high with fe co mixed catalyst which is undesirable for the ozonation treatment process both catalysts proved useful the co ppt catalyst was more effective in debromination and toc removal however it failed to minimize bromate formation while the mixed catalyst provided reasonable debromination and toc removal but significantly reduced bromate formation acknowledgments the authors are thankful for the financial support received from mangosuthu

mixed is compared to ozonation alone in ozonation alone only 40 of 2 4 6 tbp was converted while 11 of toc was removed from water the surface characteristics of the catalysts material determined by bet nh3 tpd sem and point zero charge pzc measurements revealed that the fe co co ppt catalyst exhibited superior quality compared to fe co mixed catalyst material hence contributing to higher catalytic activity for debromination of 2 4 6 tbp toc removal and organic by product org bp minimization however it was unable to effectively limit bromate formation during ozonation nh3 tpd and pzc measurements showed that fe co co ppt catalyst contained more acidic sites than fe co mixed catalyst hence contributing to higher ozone decomposition to hydroxyl radicals fe co mixed catalyst was more effective in inhibiting bromate formation with 9 1 fe co co ppt catalyst 39 of toxic bromate was formed during ozonation while in the presence of 9 1 fe co mixed catalyst a significant drop in bromate

because they are dominant groundwater pollutants and are significant constituents of hazardous wastes and landfill run offs they are mainly used in the manufacture of insecticides refrigerator coolants fire retardants industrial solvents degreasing agents and in organic synthesis hoc s pose a threat to the environment because of their high toxic nature incomplete degradation and ability to easily transform into more poisonous org bp s 1 2 when hoc s degrade they form smaller org bp s which are sometimes extremely far more hazardous than the original substance the most hazardous and

released from industrial commercial and agricultural sources contain one to three halogen atoms attached to carbon atoms of the numerous semi volatile hoc s present in water the degradation and toxicity of most have been extensively researched however attention have been largely concentrated on the chlorinated compounds 4 7 while the complex brominated aromatic compounds have not been well explored furthermore most of these studies did not consider the fate of the bromide ion released during the debromination reaction in aqueous media which due to its high reactivity with strong oxidising agents lead to the formation of carcinogenic bromate ions 8 ozone being one of the strongest oxidants is used extensively in water treatment processes has showed great ability to oxidize a number of organic and inorganic substances however ozonation alone is ineffective to completely remove the persistant organic pollutants and sometimes generate toxic org bp s 9 10 its low solubility in water combined with its costly preparation and inability to completely oxidise organic compounds in water can make its implementation economically unfeasible 11 another limiting factor is its poor stability in the reaction medium which is highly dependent on solution ph since hydroxide ions initiate the decomposition of ozone molecules a more serious problem arises during ozonation of waters containing bromide ions which can readily oxidise to carcinogenic bromate ions 12 bromate once formed in water is difficult to remove and current methods for bromate minimization during ozonation are found to be somewhat impractical and costly 13 therefore there is a need to research new methods to reduce bromate formation during ozonation this work hence demonstrates how a fe co metal oxide catalyst prepared by physical mixing can be used effectively to minimize bromate formation during ozonation of bromide containing waters in recent years the use of solid catalyst materials in ozonation processes have become popular because of their high effectiveness and improvement of water quality 14 efficiency of the catalytic ozonation process depends on the choice of catalytic material its surface characteristics and the ph of the water all influencing ozone decomposition and substrate conversion occurring on the active sites of the catalyst surface 15 heterogeneous catalysts made of metal oxides mixed metal oxides supported and unsupported metals are the most frequently used materials for ozone initiated oxidation of organic pollutants in wastewater their increased resistance to change minimum loss and superior activity can have a positive effect on the decomposition of ozone thereby accelerating the destruction of many contaminants in wastewater 16 18 they have an added advantage of being easily recycled and reused without further treatment however many of these catalytic materials are prepared using transition or rare metals and their toxicity and exorbitant cost are major limitations for industrial applications iron and its salts on the other hand are less costly and a more environmentally friendly materials and more importantly are available in abundance 19 however in spite of these advantages iron is still understated in the field of catalysis compared to other transition metals 20 limited literature reports have shown iron and iron based materials been applied to wastewater treatment processes for the removal of various hazardous compounds 21 23 this study therefore evaluates and compares the conversion and mineralization of 2 4 6 tbp a potential environmental toxic pollutant found in water 24 by ozone alone and catalytic ozonation in the presence of fe doped with co by co precipitation and a simple physical mixing method the main objective of the work is to provide a strategy for bromate minimization during catalytic ozonation of bromide containing water this is achieved by monitoring the extent of i bromide bromate and ii org bp formation during the ozonation of 2 4 6 tbp 2 experimental 2 1 sample preparation since the solubility 2 4 6 tbp is 50 ppm in water at 25 c a 50 ppm stock solution of 2 4 6 tribromophenol 99 ar grade sigma aldrich prepared by mixing 0 05 g of the solid in milli q water in a 1 dm3 volumetric flask was used for this study 2 2 catalyst preparation all chemicals used to prepare the catalyst material were of analytical grade purchased from merck sa fe alone was used as a reference and fe combined with 10 20 and 30 co was used for the mixed metal oxides the following two methods were used to prepare the mixed metal oxide catalysts 2 2 1 co precipitation method referred to as co ppt catalyst for each catalyst each salt was accurately weighed out separately according to amounts shown in table a1 and dissolved in 200 cm3 of deionized water the resulting solutions were then transferred into separate 500 cm3 separating funnels each salt solution was then added dropwise from each separating funnel to 250 cm3 of a 1 mol dm3 na2co3 solution contained in a 2 dm3 beaker with vigorous stirring over a period of 4 5 h required amounts of 0 1 mol dm3 naoh solution was introduced intermittently to maintain the ph of the metal salt mixture between 9 and 11 after addition of all the salt solution to the beaker it was left to stand for about 1 h the resultant precipitate was filtered and washed thoroughly with deionized water until filtrate was clear it was then dried at 100 c for 1 h and calcined as previously reported 21 23 in the presence of air in a muffle furnace set at 500 c for 5 h 2 2 2 physical mixing method referred to as mixed catalyst weighed out each salt according to table a1 in a porcelain crucible and mixed thoroughly to obtain a homogeneous mix the crucible was then placed in a muffle furnace set at 500 c for 5 h all catalyst materials were finely ground and passed through a 200 mesh sieve to achieve comparable particle size afterward they were stored in a dry vacuum oven for further investigation 2 3 catalyst characterization fe co co ppt and fe co mixed catalyst material was characterized as follows i scanning electron microscope sem measurements giving information about morphology and location of metallic species on catalyst surface was carried out using a joel jsm 6100 microscope equipped with an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer edx fitted with a tungsten filament the images were taken with an emission current of 100 μa and an accelerator voltage of 12 kv ii the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of each catalyst was carried out at 77 k on a micromeritics gemini 2360 automated single multiple point bet surface area analyser the surface area pore size distribution pore volume and average pore diameter were determined by the bjh method iii the point of zero charge pzc was estimated using a potentiometric titration method 25 and iv temperature programmed desorption tpd studies with nh3 was conducted using the autochem 2910 micromeritics usa instrument fitted with a thermal conductivity detector a 50 mg catalyst sample was pre treated by passing helium over it at a flow rate of 50 cm3 min and 200 c for 2 h it was then saturated with 10 ammonia further flushed with helium and thereafter placed in a u shaped quartz sample tube tpd analysis was conducted from ambient temperature to 800 c at a heating rate of 10 c min 2 4 ozonation procedure ozone gas was generated by passing 200 cm3 min medical grade oxygen 99 9 purity through the electric discharge unit of an ozonox lab 7000 ozonator instrument an ozone concentration of 100 ppm achieved with a generator current of 0 42 a was used for all experiments the concentration of ozone in each experiment was measured by using the iodometric method by bubbling the ozone gas into a ki solution and then titrating the liberated iodine with standard thiosulphate solution with starch as indicator 26 the ozone reaction was carried out in a 100 cm3 cylindrical glass reactor equipped with a sintered porous ceramic gas diffuser located at the bottom of the reactor to produce fine bubbles and a small magnetic stirrer to ensure homogeneous mixing of ozone the catalyst and the aqueous substrate mixture preliminary experiments showed that ozone reacts very fast with 2 4 6 tbp in water therefore ozonation times of 5 10 15 and 20 min were chosen for this work ozone gas was continuously bubbled at room temperature for the required time interval into 25 cm3 aqueous solution of 50 ppm 2 4 6 tbp containing 0 1 g catalyst material all experiments were performed in triplicate the experimental set up for this work is shown in fig 1 to confirm the presence of ozone catalyst surface reactions experiments were conducted to study the extent of ozone decomposition in water during ozonation alone and ozonation in the presence of fe co co ppt and fe co mixed catalyst water samples in the absence of 2 4 6 tbp but containing only 0 1 g of each catalyst was ozonated for 5 10 15 and 25 min respectively pure water ozonated for the same time intervals were used as control the concentration of the excess ozone trapped in ki solution was then determined by titration with standard thiosulphate solution 2 5 instrumental analysis a hplc method was developed and validated to monitor the percentage conversion of 2 4 6 tbp as a function of ozone treatment time using a shimadzu 20a high performance liquid chromatograph fitted with a variable wavelength uv detector and a waters novapak silica 4 μm column 3 9 mm i d and 150 mm length maintained at 30 c the system was run on isocratic mode using a filtered and degassed mobile phase solution of 60 40 v v methanol water set at a flow rate of 1 cm3 min linearity of the hplc instrument was confirmed by injecting various standard solutions 2 4 6 tbp prepared by serial dilution of a 50 ppm 2 4 6 tbp stock solution detailed instrument parameters and calibration data are presented in figure a1 the total organic carbon toc was determined the method proposed by hach 27 a 10 cm3 sample was first sparged under slightly acidic conditions ph 2 to remove inorganic carbon the organic carbon was then digested in a drb 20 cod reactor with persulphate powder and acid to form carbon dioxide the carbon dioxide was then allowed to diffuse into a ph indicator reagent contained in an ampule to form carbonic acid the coloured solution was then measured using a dr 1900 portable spectrophotometer at a wavelength setting of 430 nm the amount of colour change is related to the parts per million of organic carbon present in the sample calibration of the spectrophotometer was carried out by using a 1000 ppm potassium acid phthalate standard solution the concentration of bromide bromate and low molecular weight organic acids was determined by injecting 20 μl of each ozonated sample into a metrohm 761 compact ion chromatograph ic fitted with a conductivity detector and a metrohm asupp 5 250 4 0 column the eluent used was a mixture of 3 2 mm na2co3 and 1 0 mm nahco3 maintained at a flow rate of 0 5 cm3 min a 50 mm h2so4 solution served as the suppressor reagent bromide bromate and low molecular weight organic ar grade standards purchased from merck sa was used to check linearity and calibrate the ic instrument conductivity of each solution before and after ozonation was measured by a calibrated conductivity meter the ph of the substrate solution before and after ozonation was measured at room temperature using a metrohm combined ph glass electrode pt 1000 calibration of the conductivity and ph electrode was conducted prior to sample measurements 3 results and discussion 3 1 percent conversion and toc removal in heterogeneous catalytic ozonation systems the use of mixed metal oxides was found to improve both adsorption of organic compounds and the production of hydroxyl radicals chemisorption of the organic substrate on the surface of the catalyst is thought to be one of the essential steps for the catalytic reaction once absorbed organic molecules are then degraded by molecular ozone and or by hydroxyl radicals 28 this part of the study therefore investigates the effect of cobalt content on catalytic activity of co loaded on fe prepared by ii co precipitation co ppt and ii physical mixing mixed fig 2 shows percent conversion of 2 4 6 tbp and toc removed as a function of time for ozonation alone and catalytic ozonation with 10 and 30 co loaded on fe respectively the data indicates that conversion of 2 4 6 tbp by ozone alone is significantly lower compared to catalytic ozonation with fe co co ppt and fe co mixed in ozonation alone only 40 of substrate was converted and 11 of toc was removed after 20 min of ozone treatment in the presence of fe conversion of 2 4 6 tbp increased marginal to 54 while 15 of toc was removed after 20 min of ozonation these results reveal that ozonation alone or ozonation in the presence of fe alone is a slow process and is therefore not suitable for effective conversion and mineralization of 2 4 6 tbp in water when 2 4 6 tbp was ozonated in the presence of co alone only 41 of substrate was converted and 10 toc was removed after 20 min indicating that co alone has insignificant influence on degradation of 2 4 6 tbp when compared to ozonation alone therefore no further tests were conducted with co alone when co was loaded on fe by co precipitation a significant increase in substrate conversion and toc removal was achieved a co loading of 10 on fe resulted in 86 conversion and 45 toc removal after 20 min of ozone treatment when the co loading on fe was increased to 20 conversion of the target compound increased to 94 and toc removal further increased to 49 after 20 min a 30 co loading on fe resulted in complete conversion of 2 4 6 tbp after 20 min while 58 of the total carbon was successfully mineralized compared to ozonation alone fe co co ppt catalytic ozonation showed a significant improvement in conversion of 2 4 6 tbp but more importantly a higher percentage of carbon was successfully removed from the substrate solution in the case of fe co mixed catalyst a significant drop in 2 4 6 tbp conversion and toc removal efficiency was noted for all co loadings the fe co mixed catalyst is not as effective as the fe co co ppt catalyst in converting 2 4 6 tbp and removing toc from the water however it was more effective than ozonation alone in catalytic ozonation with 9 1 fe co mixed a 30 drop in substrate conversion was observed compared to ozonation with 9 1 fe co co ppt catalyst and only 16 of the total carbon converted was removed after 20 min of ozone treatment ozonation in the presence of 8 2 fe co mixed catalyst resulted in a 34 drop in substrate conversion and only 19 of toc removed after 20 min in ozonation with 7 3 fe co mixed catalyst a 35 drop in substrate conversion was noted compared to ozonation with 7 3 fe co co ppt catalyst and only 21 of the total carbon converted was removed after 20 min of ozone treatment the results indicate that catalytic activity is severely affected when co is combined with fe by physical mixing resulting in lower substrate conversion and poor toc removal catalytic activity of the used catalyst was examined by conducting a second cycle of ozone experiments in the presence of the used catalyst it was found for all experiments that the percent conversion of 2 4 6 tbp and toc removal during the second ozonation cycle compared favourably with the first cycle thus confirming stable catalytic activity data for the textural properties of the two types of catalyst material shown in table 1 revealed different surface characteristics which can explain and support the superior catalytic activity of fe co co ppt compared to fe co mixed catalyst the data in table 1 indicate that the surface characteristics of the fe co co ppt catalyst material is better than both the fe co mixed and undoped fe catalyst material when 10 co is loaded on fe by co precipitation a significant increase in surface area occurred an increase in co loadings on fe resulted in a further increase in surface area and pore volume while a drop in average pore size was observed this could be attributed to the even distribution of co on fe during co precipitation which is confirmed by sem monographs shown in fig 3 these improvements to the catalyst surface properties significantly contributed to the higher catalytic activity of fe co co ppt for conversion of 2 4 6 tbp and toc removal from water by ozonation in contrast the fe co catalyst sythesized by physical mixing resulted in a much smaller surface area thus displayed reduced catalytic activity and hence poor conversion of 2 4 6 tbp and toc removal from water during ozonation the sem monographs of fe co co ppt and fe co mixed shown in fig 3 reveals that the fe co mixed catalyst surface is non uniform which is due to the formation of clusters of fe co o with significantly smaller surface area and large cavities whereas the fe co co ppt surface exhibits relatively more homogeneous and fine pore morphology with relatively larger surface area which enhances catalytic activity in water during ozonation a variation in ph as a function of ozone treatment time at different reaction conditions is illustrated in table 2 the data shows that in all cases the ph of the ozonated solution decreases as ozonation time increases which may be due to the formation of organic and or inorganic acidic products also evident is that with fe co mixed the initial solution ph is much lower than with fe co co ppt at lower ph 2 4 6 tbp is degraded by molecular ozone while at alkaline ph the hydroxyl radicals played an important role in the degradation process 29 alkaline medium facilitates hydroxyl radical generation which favoured the degradation process due to its higher oxidative power than ozone while at acidic to neural ph ozone is more stable in solution furthermore hydroxyl radicals reduces the ozone lifetime in aqueous media hence higher ozone decomposition is achieved 30 there could be two other reasons which are dependent on the solution ph for the improved conversion of 2 4 6 tbp and toc removal during fe co co ppt catalytic ozonation compared to fe co mixed catalytic ozonation firstly in the presence of fe co co ppt catalyst since the initial solution ph is significantly higher than the pka of 2 4 6 tbp 31 we would expect the organic substrate to exist mostly as the 2 4 6 tribromophenolate ion as illustrated in fig 4 this ion due to its negative end would react much faster with ozone compared to molecular 2 4 6 tbp itself thus leading to improved degradation however in fe co mixed the initial solution ph was slightly lower than the pka of 2 4 6 tbp meaning that more of it existed in the molecular form hence poorer degradation by ozone secondly coox are thought to be the main active sites to affect the decomposition of ozone and formation of surface hydroxyl groups 32 this indicates that the loading of co onto fe by co precipitation increases the number of surface hydroxyl groups which enhances ozone decomposition to form hydroxyl radicals thereby leading to increased conversion of substrate molecule the pattern of 2 4 6 tbp conversion and toc removal suggests that the presence of co forms surface active sites on the iron based catalyst 33 and when the co content on fe is increased the number of surface active sites also increases thus enhancing the production of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals when the fe co surface is in contact with water it generally becomes hydrated forming a monolayer of surface hydroxyl groups these groups can either become protonated or deprotonated as illustrated in scheme 1 depending on the quantity of hydrogen and hydroxyl ions present when the concentration of the f e c o o surface charges is equal to the concentration of the f e c o o h 2 surface charges there will therefore be a net zero charge on the catalyst surface referred to as the point of zero charge pzc for this reason the initial solution ph is an important factor to consider during fe co catalytic ozonation in water since it can greatly influence the surface charge characteristics of the fe co catalyst the pzc values determined experimentally by potentiometric titration for 10 and 30 co loadings in fe co co ppt and fe co mixed is illustrated in fig 5 the pzc of fe co co ppt is much higher than that of fe co mixed indicating that fe co co ppt has more f e c o o h 2 sites furthermore in the presence of 9 1 fe co co ppt catalyst the initial ph of the substrate solution was 9 1 much lower than its pzc value of 10 2 meaning that the catalyst surface will now generate more positively charged f e c o o h 2 sites 34 the increase in the number of positively charged sites on the catalyst surface is advantageous during ozonation since ozone due to its strong polar nature 35 will show a higher affinity for adsorption by the negative end onto the positive catalyst surface thus leading to enhanced decomposition and generation of h o radicals as illustrated in scheme 2 these released h o radicals will then rapidly debrominate the 2 4 6 tbp molecule to form the hydroxylated intermediate by product and large quantities of bromide ions which is responsible for the sharp increase in solution conductivity from 3 μs cm to 180 μs cm therefore conversion of 2 4 6 tbp in fe co co ppt catalytic ozonation primarily occurs via h o radicals formed during ozone catalyst surface interactions in the case of 9 1 fe co mixed catalyst a lower pzc value of 5 1 was obtained suggesting the presence of excess f e c o o sites on the catalyst surface the number of negative sites increases with an increase in solution ph the metal oxide then behaves as a strong bronsted base and a cation exchanger the lower conversion and toc removal in 9 1 fe co mixed catalyst may suggest that ozone molecule has a poor affinity towards these negative sites hence poor decomposition of ozone into hydroxyl radicals fig 6 illustrates the extent of ozone decomposition in water in the absence of 2 4 6 tbp for ozonation alone and ozonation in the presence of fe co co ppt and fe co mixed catalyst the results indicate that ozone decomposition in water alone is poor with only 14 decomposed and solution ph decreasing initially from 7 02 to 5 71 after 20 min of ozonation however in the presence of fe co co ppt catalyst o 3 decomposition is significantly improved ozonation of water in the presence of 9 1 fe co co ppt resulted in 40 of o 3 decomposing and solution ph decreasing initially from 9 48 to 8 92 after 20 min which was lower than 10 20 the pzc value of 9 1 fe co co ppt catalyst in the presence of 7 3 fe co co ppt 60 of o 3 was successfully decomposed with solution ph decreasing initially from 8 30 to 8 10 after 20 min which was lower than 9 00 the pzc value of 7 3 fe co co ppt catalyst in the case of fe co mixed catalyst ozone decomposition was found to be much lower that is in the presence of 9 1 fe co mixed 20 of o 3 was decomposed and solution ph decreased from 6 04 to 5 37 but higher than 5 10 the pzc value of 9 1 fe co mixed catalyst in the case of 7 3 fe co mixed catalyst only 35 of o 3 was decomposed and solution ph decreased from 5 25 to 4 63 also higher than 4 00 the pzc value of 7 3 fe co mixed catalyst the results confirm that decomposition of ozone by fe co catalytic ozonation occurs on the fe co positive and or negative sites through adsorption and generation of h o radicals furthermore ozone decomposition is favoured when the solution ph is high and below the pzc value of the fe co catalyst therefore the conversion of 2 4 6 tbp in water and mineralization of the converted carbon by fe co co ppt catalytic ozonation is primarily due to h o radical oxidation reactions while ozonation with fe co mixed catalyst is dominated by molecular o 3 reactions to confirm the presence of acidic sites on the fe co catalyst surface nh3 tpd analysis was conducted for each catalyst material the nh3 tpd profiles illustrated in fig 7 shows that an increase in co loading on fe from 10 to 30 resulted in an increase in ammonia desorption for both types of catalyst material however the overall acidity is higher for fe co co ppt than fe co mixed catalyst material the total acidity for 7 3 fe co co ppt was 10 cm3 g stp while the acidity for the 7 3 fe co mixed catalyst material was only 1 3 cm3 g stp furthermore the tcd signal and peak area for 30 co loaded on fe is larger than 10 co loaded on fe indicating a higher concentration of acidic sites on the 7 3 fe co catalyst surface these acidic sites improve adsorption desorption of ozone leading to enhanced decomposition into hydroxyl radicals this behaviour is consistent with the results obtained for the decomposition of o 3 illustrated in fig 6 the fe co co ppt catalyst show two well separated peaks at 690 c and 780 c suggesting two types of acidic sites the lower temperature peak is an indication of slightly weaker bond strength and hence slightly weaker acidic sites 36 fe co mixed catalyst only has one peak at 592 c suggesting the existence of one type of acidic site evenly distributed on the catalyst surface a further observation is that nh3 desorption from fe co co ppt occurs at a higher temperature and from fe co mixed catalyst it occurs at a lower temperature which indicates that fe co co ppt has a higher population of stronger acidic sites these strong acidic sites result in improved catalytic activity leading to more effective deprotonation reactions producing hydroxyl radicals an excess of these hydroxyl radicals then results in an improvement in 2 4 6 tbp conversion and toc removal from water 3 2 oxidation of bromide to bromate ion chromatographic results for the catalytic ozonation of 2 4 6 tbp in water with fe alone and co loaded on fe by co precipitation showed the generation of large amounts of b r and b r o 3 ions as major products and the yield of these ions gradually increased with an increase in ozone treatment time furthermore conductivity measurements of the ozonated 2 4 6 tbp water mixtures showed a steady increase from 3 μs cm to 121 μs cm signifying b r and b r o 3 ion formation illustrations a and b in fig 8 shows the variation in percentage yield of b r and b r o 3 ions formed during ozonation alone and catalytic ozonation in the presence of fe and fe co co ppt measured at uncontrolled solution ph it is evident that in ozonation alone both b r and b r o 3 yields are low however when co is loaded on fe by co precipitation a significant amount of b r o 3 ions was produced in ozonation alone only 14 of bromate ions were formed however in the presence of 10 co loaded on fe by co precipitation 39 of b r o 3 was formed after 20 min of ozone treatment increasing the co loading on fe to 20 lowered the yield of b r o 3 slightly to 35 a further increase in the co loading on fe to 30 saw a further but marginal drop in yield of b r o 3 to 31 after 20 min of ozone treatment this pattern of b r o 3 formation indicates that its formation is influenced by the presence of co ie when the co content of the fe co co ppt catalyst is increased the yield of b r o 3 ions slightly decreases for the same time intervals the yield of b r ion showed a gradual increase as the co content of the catalyst material was increased one possible reason for the slight decrease in the bromide to bromate oxidation rate could be due to the drop in the solution ph during ozone treatment table 2 since b r o 3 formation is inhibited as solution ph decreases 37 for example in the presence of 10 co the initial solution ph was 9 10 and after 20 min of ozone treatment it dropped to 8 54 similarly in the presence of 30 co solution ph dropped from an initial value of 8 00 to 7 57 after 20 min as the solution ph gets closer to 8 80 the pka of the h o b r o b r system more hydronium ions are present causing the h o b r o b r equilibrium system to shift to the left thereby favouring h o b r formation since h o b r is not easily oxidised to bromate by ozone 38 therefore a lower yield of bromate ion is expected when solution ph is greater than 8 80 the pka of the h o b r o b r system more hydroxide ions are present resulting in a decrease of hydronium ions the h o b r o b r equilibrium system to shift to the right thus favouring the formation of o b r which reacts more readily with o 3 to form b r o 3 an illustration of the reaction pathways is shown in scheme 3 therefore b r oxidation to b r o 3 is more favourable in fe co co ppt catalytic ozonation compared to ozonation alone since its solution ph is higher than 8 80 compared to ozonation alone another reason for the higher yield of b r o 3 ion formation during fe co co ppt catalytic ozonation is due to the rapid oxidation of b r by ozone itself and or by h o radicals the fe co co ppt catalytic ozonation system provides the alkaline medium for ozone to readily react with excess hydroxide ions and also interact with the surface active acidic sites of the fe co co ppt catalyst to produce h o radicals fig 9 illustrates variation in percentage yield of b r and b r o 3 ions formed during ozonation alone and catalytic ozonation in the presence of fe and co loaded onto fe by physical mixing a notable observation here is that when co is loaded on fe by physical mixing a significant drop in yield of b r o 3 ions was detected compared to ozonation alone and ozonation in the presence of fe co co ppt catalyst when 10 co was loaded on fe by physical mixing only 5 of b r o 3 was formed after 20 min of ozone treatment increasing the co loading on fe to 20 resulted in a slight increase in the yield of b r o 3 to 7 after 20 min of ozonation a further increase in the co loading on fe to 30 saw a further but marginal increase in yield of b r o 3 to 8 after 20 min it is further observed that for all cobalt loadings on iron a large quantity of b r ions was detected indicating that the rate of oxidation of b r to b r o 3 by ozone in the presence of fe co mixed is significantly reduced this pattern of bromide to bromate formation could be explained by considering the initial solution ph in the presence of fe co mixed catalyst firstly since the initial solution ph in all cases table 2 is much higher than the pzc value of the fe co mixed catalyst fig 5 it would mean that the catalyst surface will consist mostly of negative f e c o active sites these sites will tend to repel the negatively charged bromide ions preventing the oxidation of bromide to bromate ions on the catalyst surface and hence a lower yield of bromate ions secondly the initial solution ph in all cases is much lower than 8 8 the pka of the hobr obr system more hydronium ions are present causing the h o b r o b r equilibrium system to shift to the left thereby favouring h o b r formation and since reactivity of hobr with ozone is poor a lower yield of bromate ion is obtained to evaluate the effectiveness of the fe co co ppt and fe co mixed catalyst material to minimize bromate formation in water a 10 ppm bromide solution was ozonated in the presence of each catalyst material the results of these experiments are shown in fig 10 it is evident that the pattern of bromide to bromate oxidation by catalytic ozonation is similar to that obtained in the presence of 2 4 6 tbp in ozonation alone only 5 7 ppm of the 10 ppm bromide ions were converted to bromate and solution ph decreased initially from 6 82 to 6 01 after 10 min of ozone treatment however in the presence of 10 co loaded on fe by co precipitation the bromide was completely oxidised to bromate while solution ph decreased marginally from 8 84 to 8 32 after 10 min of ozonation increasing the co loading on fe to 30 lowered the yield of b r o 3 to 6 52 ppm and solution ph decreased initially from 8 12 to 7 66 after 10 min of ozone treatment the results confirm that i oxidation of b r to b r o 3 during ozonation with fe co co ppt decreases as co content of the catalyst is increased and ii b r o 3 formation is minimized as solution ph decreases in the case of fe co mixed catalyst a lower yield of b r o 3 ions was achieved when compared to both ozonation alone and ozonation in the presence of fe co co ppt when 10 of co was combined with fe by physical mixing only 2 ppm of bromate was formed after 10 min of ozone treatment and solution ph decreased initially from 5 55 to 5 31 increasing the co content of the fe co mixed catalyst to 30 increases the yield of bromate marginally to 3 ppm with solution ph decreasing initially from 5 10 to 4 87 after 10 min of ozone treatment the low solution ph caused by the presence of fe co mixed catalyst minimizes the oxidation of b r to b r o 3 during ozonation 3 3 formation of organic by products ozonation processes applied in water treatment to remove toxic compounds can sometimes lead to the production of more toxic by products one study has reported that org bp yield increases as a function of ozone dosage and or ozonation time 39 whereas another has shown that a further increase in ozonation time can decrease the org bp yield 40 therefore it is essential to monitor and find ways to minimize the generation of org bp s during ozonation of 2 4 6 tbp in water two organic acids namely formic and acetic acids were identified as major intermediate products table 3 compares the yield based on mass balance of carbon in mol of org bp s organic acids formic and acetic acids and toc removed after 20 min for i ozonation alone ii ozonation in the presence of fe and iii ozonation in the presence of 10 20 and 30 co loaded on fe prepared by i co precipitation and ii physical mixing it is evident from table 3 that ozonation of 2 4 6 tbp in different reaction conditions produces a significant amount of organic acids and org bp s in ozonation alone of the 40 of the total carbon converted only 9 was removed and 31 remained in solution of this amount 19 existed as org bp s and 12 existed as short chain carboxylic acids formic and acetic acids the high percentage of org bp formation suggest that ozonation alone is ineffective to oxidize most of the org bp s to carboxylic acids hence leading to poor mineralization in the case of 100 fe a similar trend was observed however the yields were slightly higher therefore indicating that ozonation of the substrate solution with fe is also not favoured for oxidation of org bp s and successive carboxylic acid mineralization when co was loaded on fe by co precipitation yield of org bp s dropped significantly compared to ozonation alone and a considerable amount of toc was removed in the presence of 9 1 fe co co ppt of the 86 of the total carbon converted 57 was removed and 29 remained in solution of this amount only 12 formed org bp s and 17 was present as short chain carboxylic acids in 8 2 fe co co ppt of the 94 carbon converted 59 of was successfully removed and 35 remained in solution of which 10 formed org bp s and 25 formed carboxylic acids increasing the co content of the catalyst material to 30 produced similar results in 7 3 fe co co ppt of all the organic carbon converted 74 was removed from the water through mineralization and only 26 was left in solution only 6 of this carbon formed org bp s and the balance existed as organic acids the trend in these results show that when co is used as a dopant on fe during catalytic ozonation a significant amount of org bp s is converted to short chain carboxylic acids followed by mineralization to carbon dioxide when the co loading on fe is increased a significant drop in org bp formation occurs and an improvement in mineralization of organic acids is evident a 30 co loading on fe showed optimum activity for org bp minimization and carboxylic acid mineralization during catalytic ozonation of 2 4 6 tbp in aqueous media the data obtained for catalytic ozonation of 2 4 6 tbp in aqueous media with co combined with fe by physical mixing is listed in table 3 the pattern of carbon transformation in the presence of fe co mixed is different in comparison to ozonation with fe co co ppt catalyst in fe co mixed catalyst toc removal was found to be significantly lower and a large amount of organic carbon still remained in solution however when the co loading on fe was increased a marginal increase in toc removal was observed a major limitation is that the yield of org bp s were relatively high with fe co mixed catalyst which is undesirable for the ozonation treatment process fig 11 compares the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of various loadings of co on fe prepared by co precipitation co ppt and by mixing mixed both types of catalyst material show a type iv isotherm with a type h3 hysteresis loop which indicates a mesoporous structure 41 fe co co ppt catalyst resulted in a slightly broader hysteresis loop ranging from 0 40 to 0 99 of the relative pressure while the hysteresis loop of fe co mixed for all co loadings is much narrower starting at 0 70 and ending at 0 99 suggesting a less porous structure and hence a smaller surface area and pore volume 42 the poor surface characteristics of the fe co mixed catalyst material is further indication of its poor activity which could be the reason for its poor removal of org bp s from water during ozonation although both fe co co ppt and fe co mixed catalyst material show similar types of isotherms however the quantity of nitrogen adsorbed was significantly different nitrogen adsorption on both catalyst material showed an increasing trend with co loadings on fe but the fe co co ppt catalyst showed higher nitrogen adsorption than the fe co mixed catalyst material for all co loadings this pattern of surface behaviour suggests that fe co co ppt has more superior catalytic activity than fe co mixed to minimize org bp formation during ozonation of 2 4 6 tbp in water 4 conclusion heterogeneous catalytic ozonation of toxic 2 4 6 tbp in water with co fe co ppt catalyst material showed significant improvement in conversion and toc removal compared to ozonation alone increasing the co loading on fe from 10 to 30 enhanced debromination of the toxic substrate and subsequent toc removal from water when 30 of co was loaded on fe complete conversion of 2 4 6 tbp was achieved and 58 of the total carbon converted was successfully mineralized after 20 min of ozone treatment catalytic activity was severely affected when co was combined with fe by physical mixing resulting in a significant drop in substrate conversion and toc removal efficiency in fe co co ppt catalyst the original ph of the substrate solution was much lower than its pzc value causing hydroxyl groups on the catalyst surface to become positively charged which then attracts the negative end of the ozone molecule hence enhancing decomposition and increasing generation of h o radicals in the case of fe co mixed catalyst a lower pzc value was obtained resulting in presence of excess negative sites on the catalyst surface hence leading to poor substrate conversion and toc removal catalytic ozonation with co loaded on fe by co precipitation resulted in the generation of large amount of carcinogenic bromate ions much higher than in ozonation alone however the drop in solution ph with increasing co loadings on fe caused the yield of bromate ions to decrease slightly the fe co mixed catalyst preparation method was simple and less time consuming compared to the fe co co ppt catalyst preparation method and it showed potential to minimize bromate formation more effectively compared to ozonation alone and ozonation with fe co co ppt catalyst ozonation alone was ineffective to oxidize most of the org bp s to carboxylic acids hence resulting in poor mineralization increasing the co loading on fe from 10 to 30 caused a significant drop in org bp formation and improvement in mineralization of organic acids the trend in the results show that when co is used as a dopant on fe during catalytic ozonation a significant amount of org bp s is converted to carboxylic acids followed by mineralization to carbon dioxide with fe co mixed catalyst toc removal was found to be significantly lower that is a large amount of organic carbon still remained in solution a major limitation is that the yield of org bp was relatively high with fe co mixed catalyst which is undesirable for the ozonation treatment process both catalysts proved useful the co ppt catalyst was more effective in debromination and toc removal however it failed to minimize bromate formation while the mixed catalyst provided reasonable debromination and toc removal but significantly reduced bromate formation acknowledgments the authors are thankful for the financial support received from mangosuthu

14372,this work addresses the challenging problem of separating pertechnetate tco4 ions from huge 1010 times no3 background which is very important for nuclear waste water treatment it describes the facilitated transport based selective removal of 99mtco4 from aqueous feed solutions through a tetraphenylarsonium perchlorate loaded polypropylene based supported liquid membrane keeping in mind the possible aqueous waste compositions in the nuclear industry the transport selectivity of 99mtco4 has been studied in the presence of varying concentrations of no3 co3 2 and oh ions as no3 is the major anion in aqueous nuclear waste solutions major importance has been given to study the selectivity of 99mtco4 over no3 the transport selectivity has been studied using radiotracer technique as well as ion chromatography technique results indicate that the membrane is highly selective towards 99mtco4 considering even high concentration of no3 does not hinder its transport appreciably high decontamination factor for 99mtco4 over no3 and other anions has been obtained in all the cases the promising results show the possibility of using this membrane based fast process for nuclear waste treatment keywords tc tetraphenylarsonium slm facilitated transport nuclear waste 1 introduction 99tc is of major concern to the environment 1 2 because of its long half life 2 11 105 years and significant 6 05 fission yield for 235u it is actually the largest fraction of the total long lived radio isotopes in nuclear waste and hence needs to be taken care of before disposing of liquid nuclear waste 3 14 in aqueous waste streams 99tc is mostly present as pertechnetate tco4 form 15 this species is having high mobility in the aquatic environment and hence poses a real threat to groundwater contamination till date different types of materials have been used for removal sequestration of this species from nuclear waste streams a comparison of the 99tc extraction ability absorption transport kinetics selectivity and reusability of all the reported literature is given in table 1 it can be seen from the table that the majority of the studies are based on either adsorption or solvent extraction based process while the solvent extraction based processes are fast 5 10 min contact time the adsorption kinetics of the sorption based processes are variable 30 min 24 h with fes based sorbent 16 authors observed a strong competition between the no3 and the tco4 ions for the same sites on the adsorbent the precipitation based process 17 though efficient but the overall time taken for the process is long days authors 18 have reported excellent immobilization of 99tc by fe ii goethite and shown that there is no significant leakage of the radioisotope even after 6 months however the initial processing time of the tc goethite solids was of the order of a few days many of these studies have reported 99tc removal from simulated nuclear waste solutions or similar compositions 15 22 but had not reported studied the mutual selectivity of this component of interest against other major components of the nuclear waste solution nano3 naoh na2co3 the adsorption based processes generate high amounts of waste and require a substantial amount of chemicals to regenerate the sorbent also solvent extraction based processes involve a large amount of expensive ligands carriers on the other hand the chemical consumption and hence low operational cost and secondary waste generation are much lower in membrane based processes as can be seen from table 1 there are only 5 6 reports 23 27 on the use of the membrane based process for 99tc removal a recent molecular dynamics study 26 has indicated the possibility of removing 99tc from water using graphene oxide membrane however there is no experimental data supporting these observations yet and their observations are valid only for dilute ionic solutions grunder et al 27 reported the simultaneous extraction of cs and tco4 using a calixarene and observed that the transport was really slow after 24 h only 4 tco4 transported in 1991 r chiarizia 23 demonstrated quick efficient and simultaneous removal of u vi cr vi tc vii and no3 species from acidified groundwater using a supported liquid membrane slm based process containing a commercially available long chain aliphatic amine similarly inoue et al 24 have reported the removal of tco4 using an anion exchange paper membrane containing trimethyl hydroxyl propyl ammonium ion however the selectivity of the membrane for different anions like tco4 no3 co3 2 oh which are present in nuclear waste solutions had not been explored in either of these works it is also least probable that long chain aliphatic amines alone would have selectivity between ions of same charge state similarly lamb et al 25 have reported the cation influence on competitive transport among different anions no3 clo4 and reo4 using aza crowns in bulk liquid membranes they chose reo4 as an analog of tco4 and hence do not show any results for 99tc containing solutions the main disadvantage of these neutral ligands is that they require cation transport along with the anions for charge neutralization and most of the time the selectivity factor is largely dependent on the cation in an ionic carrier based process the anion transport is not expected to be effected by the presence of cation and vice versa thus a membrane based separation method using an ionic carrier which is highly selective for tco4 would be preferred for 99tc removal from nuclear aqueous waste streams liquid membrane lm based methods have been successfully applied for the selective removal of radiotoxic elements from nuclear waste solutions 23 27 28 here the selectivity is achieved by selective complexation of the target ion with a ligand the carrier followed by mass transfer of the complex across the membrane from feed solution to receiver solution 28 in this type of carrier facilitated process ion transport through a supported liquid membrane slm are known to be relatively faster than the corresponding dense polymer inclusion membranes 28 in spite of the significant probability of carrier leakage from the membrane slms 23 27 has been used for effective separation of metal ions even for a large volume of feed solutions 28 the surface area and throughput of the slms can be considerably increased using tubular hollow fiber module configuration 28 in 1994 omori et al 34 and kopunec et al 29 have shown selective extraction of tco4 using tetraphenylarsonium chloride in chloroform nitrobenzene srivastava et al 35 have also reported the determination fission yields of different tc isotopes by fast radiochemical separation using tetraphenylarsonium chloride however the efficacy of this reagent for selective removal of tco4 from aqueous nuclear waste streams has not been explored yet other than tco4 no3 is the major competing anion that is present in alkaline waste solution in alkaline intermediate level liquid waste ilw 17 99tco4 3 7 106 bq l is present along with 2 m no3 in solution this huge difference in the concentration makes their mutual separation really challenging with this in view in the present work an attempt has been made to address this challenging problem using tetraphenylarsonium chloride in polypropylene based slm the transport selectivity of 99mtco4 over no3 through this membrane has been studied in detail this carrier facilitated transport from feed to the receiver is based on the principle of ion exchange using a high concentration of another anion in the receiver compartment initially experiments have been carried out to optimize the receiver composition to obtain fast and complete transport of the ion of interest the decontamination factor df of 99mtco4 over no3 clo4 for different feed conditions has been determined nuclear waste solutions contain many anions other than 99mtco4 and no3 hence the transport selectivity has also been studied from a feed solution containing 99mtco4 no3 co3 2 and oh in the same ratio as is present in alkaline ilw 17 the stability of this membrane in terms of leaching of the carrier molecule has been studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and materials the 99mo activity was obtained from radiopharmaceutical division barc mumbai india the 99mtc radioactivity was extracted from a 99mo 99mtc radionuclide generator using a well established method as reported in the literature 36 all other reagents which have been used are of analytical grade the 0 1 m solutions of nacl nano3 liclo4 and na2so4 have been prepared by dissolving a known amount of the respective compound in 250 ml 18 2 mω cm deionized water the commercially available flat sheet polypropylene membrane was procured from membrana gmbh the average pore size and the thickness of the membrane were 0 2 μm and 90 μm respectively 2 2 preparation of membrane in order to increase the solubility of tetraphenylarsonium chloride in an organic medium it was converted into tetraphenylarsonium perchlorate tap form the polypropylene membrane was soaked with the ligand solution 0 015 g tap in 1 ml nitrobenzene and after complete soaking the excess of ligand solution was washed with a sufficient amount of deionized water this supported liquid membrane was subsequently used for the transport studies the carrier concentration in the membrane matrix is limited by the solubility of tap in the nitrobenzene 2 3 two compartment transport studies two compartment permeation experiments using these membranes for different feed and receiver compositions were carried out where the aim was to selectively transport 99mtco4 from the feed to the receiver compartment for this study a two compartment each of 13 5 ml glass cell with the membrane active surface area of 5 3 cm2 was used the details of the feed and receiver compositions for different transport experiments are listed in table 2 the solutions in both the compartments were stirred 350 rpm continuously to avoid any film controlled diffusion at the membrane interface in all the transport experiments 99mtco4 concentration in the feed was 3 7 106 bq l 17 the amount of 99mtco4 transferred from the feed to the receiver side was monitored by taking out 200 μl of aliquots from both the compartments at regular time intervals and counting in nai tl detector the transport of other anions no3 co3 2 was monitored by ion chromatography dionex dx 500 consisting of a self regenerator suppressor asrs ii and a conductivity detector ed 40 while the amount of oh transport was monitored by acid base titration all experiments were carried out at room temperature 300 k a fresh membrane fully loaded with the ligand solution was used for each experiment experiment 4 was repeated thrice with the same membrane to study the stability of the membrane in addition to the experiments mentioned in table 2 transport experiments were also carried out for a feed solution containing 99mtco4 3 7 106 bq l in a mixture of 0 2 m nano3 0 01 m na2co3 and 0 1 m naoh in this case the receiver solution contained 0 1 m liclo4 3 results and discussions this work describes carrier facilitated 37 transport of 99mtco4 using a slm where tetraphenylarsonium ion is the selective carrier for the target ion a pictorial representation of the principles involved in the pertechnetate transport from feed to the receiver compartment through tap loaded supported liquid membrane is shown in fig 1 at the feed solution membrane interphase the carrier selectively makes a 1 1 ionic associate 29 with the target ion transfer it across the membrane and releases it to the receiver phase in exchange of another counter ion in order to maintain electroneutrality in each compartment for every 99mtco4 transport from feed to receiver another counter anion cl no3 clo4 must be transported from receiver phase to feed phase fig 1 in order to obtain fast and complete transport of the ion of interest the receiver composition must be optimized for this two compartment transport experiments exp 1 4 were carried out with 3 7 106 bq l 99mtco4 in deionized water in feed compartment and 0 1 m solutions nano3 nacl liclo4 na2so4 in receiver compartment the 99mtco4 transport profiles as obtained from these experiments are shown in fig 2 it can be seen from the figure that the transport is fastest for clo4 and slowest for so4 2 with clo4 within 50 min 100 of 99mtco4 was transported to the receiver phase the 99mtco4 transport rate with no3 is almost comparable to that with clo4 in the presence of cl the rate was much slower and even after 3 5 h only 86 of 99mtco4 was transported to the receiver phase this rate decreased further in the presence of so4 2 in receiver compartment and after 3 5 h only 68 of 99mtco4 could be transported this particular trend in the 99mtco4 transport rate for different anions in the receiver compartment can be explained on the basis of two facts i partitioning of the exchanging anions between the aqueous receiver solution and the organic solvent in slm which is governed by their solubility in the organic solvent here nitrobenzene and ii diffusion of the anions in the membrane which is governed by their electrostatic interaction with the ion exchange groups in the membrane among all the 4 different anions clo4 no3 cl so4 2 studied clo4 has the highest tendency to dehydrate and hence has the highest partition coefficient in nitrobenzene also clo4 is known 26 to have similar hydration free energy and hydrated size to 99mtco4 the solubility of no3 in strong polar nitrobenzene dielectric constant 35 7 is almost comparable to that of clo4 while that of cl is much lower 29 as per the principle of ion exchange based facilitated transport the tco4 transport rate from feed to receiver will be governed by the transport of the exchanging anions from receiver to feed among clo4 no3 and cl all being univalent their solubility in organic solvent decides the final 99mtco4 transport rate on the other hand so4 2 has the least tendency to dehydrate and hence the least tendency to solubilize in nitrobenzene also because of its double charge its electrostatic interaction of ion exchange groups in the membrane is more than the rest univalent ions both these result in lowest 99mtco4 transport rate similar results were also reported by the authors 32 while testing adsorption and desorption of 99tc using different activated carbon columns they observed that desorption of 99mtco4 was maximum when 0 1 m naclo4 was used as eluent instead of naoh of similar concentration and they attributed this phenomenon to the structural similarity of clo4 with 99mtco4 in the present work though the transport rate for clo4 is almost comparable to that for no3 with 0 1 m nano3 in receiver compartment it will be impossible to determine the selectivity factor of tco4 over no3 henceforth unless otherwise stated all the transport studies have been done with 0 1 m liclo4 in the receiver compartment no3 is the major competing anion in the aqueous nuclear waste solution 17 in order to study the transport selectivity of 99mtco4 over no3 transport experiments exp 5 8 were done for 3 7 106 bq l 99mtco4 in presence of varying nano3 concentration 0 1 2 m in the feed compartment these compositions have been chosen to keep in mind the possible compositions of the intermediate level tc bearing waste ilw solution 17 the tco4 transport profiles obtained from these experiments are shown in fig 3 it indicates that in spite of the presence of high no3 concentration in the present work the transport rate of the anion of interest was very fast and for 0 1 m nano3 more than 99 of 99mtco4 was transported to the receiver compartment within 55 min in general the transport rate decreased with an increase in nano3 concentration due to increased competition of the ions for the carriers in the membrane however the difference between the transport rates in the presence of 1 5 m and 1 m nano3 was too small to be detected during the course of these fast processes in these two cases it took 2 h for 91 of 99mtco4 transport it is also to be noted that in presence of 2 m nano3 in feed complete transport of 90 of 99mtco4 to the receiver compartment was not possible in this particular case initially 74 of 99mtco4 was transported to the receiver phase within 43 min however after that due to the very high concentration of nitrate in feed 99mtco4 was getting back transported to feed on the receiver this back transport of 99mtco4 from receiver to feed was observed only for the highest nitrate concentration and not for other lower concentrations the tentative reason is explained below as seen from fig 2 no3 is exchangeable with clo4 in the membrane and hence is also transported to the receiver side along with 99mtco4 if the ion transport is limited by the ion exchange capacity of the membrane the larger is the amount to be transported the slower is the percentage transport rate at 2 m no3 concentration the ion transport may be taking place under saturation loading of the membrane condition limiting the rate of transport of ions as 99mtco4 is present in trace quantity only its percentage transport rate is still higher than that of no3 hence as the total amount to be transported is high even after 43 min a significant concentration of no3 still remains in the feed side which causes the 99mtco4 back transport from receiver to feed compartment for the lower no3 concentrations in feed because of much lower competition than the 2 m case the percentage tco4 transport rate is higher hence complete transport of 99mtco4 to the receiver is possible much before the remaining no3 in the feed compartment can cause its back transport to the feed compartment fig 4 is showing the comparison of the 99mtco4 and no3 transport profiles for two different nano3 concentrations exp 7 8 in the feed compartment the distinct difference in the percentage of transport rates of tco4 and no3 clearly indicates that the present slm is highly selective for 99mtco4 over no3 this behavior was similar to other nano3 concentration exp 5 6 too the transport rate of no3 is governed by the total number of ion exchange sites in the membrane and hence higher the total amount to be transported lower will be the percentage transport rate this explains the difference in the no3 transport rates for 0 1 m and 0 5 m nano3 in the feed the df of 99mtco4 over no3 as obtained from radioactivity measurement and ion chromatography has been calculated using the following equation d f t 99 m c o 4 t r a n s p o r t n o 3 t r a n s p o t in the present work the quoted df is always for 90 of 99mtco4 transport the results indicated that for all these experiments exp 5 8 99mtco4 was transported to the receiver compartment with a high degree of selectivity over no3 in general the df increases as no3 concentration decreases due to the lower competition and for 0 1 0 5 and 1 m nano3 the corresponding factors are 88 74 and 71 respectively for 2 m nano3 the df is not being quoted as complete 99mtco4 transport was not possible during the course of the experiment in order to study the stability of the membrane with respect to leaching of the carrier molecules experiment 8 was repeated thrice with the same membrane the 99mtco4 and no3 transport profiles obtained for these 3 repeat experiments are shown in fig 5 it can be seen from the figure that the percentage tco4 transport rate as well as the difference between the 99mtco4 and no3 transport rates decreased significantly in each repetition the df 88 of 99mtco4 over no3 as obtained with the fresh membrane exp 8 decreased to 4 4 and 2 5 in the next 2 consecutive repetitions it indicates that there is a significant amount of carrier leaching from the slm hence the performance of the membrane deteriorated in each repetition this is mostly because of the aqueous solubility of nitrobenzene however no better alternative solvent for tap could be found in order to study the leakage of neutral species through the membrane an experiment exp 10 was carried out for a feed solution containing 3 7 106 bq l 99mtco4 in presence of 0 1 m nano3 and a receiver solution containing deionized water it was observed that even after 7 h only 0 16 of no3 and hence same of na was transported to the receiver while the 99mtco4 transport to the receiver was below the detection limit of the radioactive counting instrument this indicates that the leakage of neutral species through the membrane is negligible and ionic interaction with the tetraphenylarsonium ion fig 1 is the only route of 99mtco4 transport as discussed previously in the majority of the experiments 0 1 m liclo4 was used as the reagent in the receiver compartment hence in order to study the mutual selectivity between 99mtco4 and clo4 transport experiment exp 9 was also carried out for 99mtco4 3 7 106 bq l and clo4 0 1 m in feed and 0 1 m nano3 in receiver compartment the tco4 and clo4 transport profiles obtained for this experiment are shown in fig 6 it can be seen from the figure that in presence of clo4 in the feed solution the 99mtco4 transport rate was too slow as compared to those in the previous cases with no3 and after 7 5 h only 38 of 99mtco4 was transported to the receiver compartment however the membrane was still selective for 99mtco4 and after 7 5 h only 0 03 of clo4 was transported to the receiver compartment the slower 99mtco4 transport rate in presence of clo4 in feed is mostly because of the significant competition between tco4 and clo4 for the tap sites in the membrane this transport experiment was not continued till 100 of 99mtco4 transport as the membrane quality significantly degrades in case of prolonged use cf previous section additionally the transport selectivity of 99mtco4 over co3 2 and oh was also studied for this the feed solution composition was chosen based on the relevant literature 17 as reported by d banerjee et al 17 the 99tc bearing nuclear waste solution contains mostly no3 2 m oh 1 m and co3 2 0 1 m as the major competing anions however it was observed in our previous experiments that complete 99mtco4 transport is not possible in the presence of 2 m nano3 in the feed hence in the present work the reported 17 anion concentrations were diluted 10 times and the transport selectivity of 99mtco4 was studied from a solution containing 0 2 m no3 0 1 m oh and 0 01 m co3 2 the receiver compartment contained 0 1 m liclo4 it is to be noted that the other elements cs sr and ru etc in the 99tc bearing nuclear waste solution 17 are present in cationic form and hence will not interfere in 99mtco4 transport in this experiment within 80 min complete 99mtco4 transport was possible and at the end of the transport the decontamination factor of the ion of interest over no3 oh and co3 2 were108 42 and 25 respectively in addition to this there is also a possibility to preconcentrate 99mtco4 by using a receiver compartment of lower volume than the feed compartment the flux of an ion across the membrane is driven by its concentration gradient between the feed and the receiver compartment hence if the compartment volumes are changed e g feed to receiver volume ratio become 100 1 instead of 1 1 keeping the membrane area and the ion concentration fixed the flux will and hence the fundamental principles involved in the process will remain unchanged however with an increase in the feed volume the total amount of 99mtco4 to be transported increases hence the total transport time for 90 transport of 99mtco4 will increase in that case a bigger membrane surface area can be used to reduce the total transport time in one of our previous work 38 similar cell design was applied for effective preconcentration as well as selective transport of cs from nuclear waste solution in order to compare the present results with those from the literature the results from the present work are also shown in table 1 the advantages of the present membrane based method over the conventional separation methods are previously discussed in the introduction section among the membrane based literature other than the work of r chiarizia 23 the present method is the only efficient and quick within 60 min report on the separation of tco4 from aqueous waste solutions while the primary amine carriers used by r chiarizia 23 have no selectivity over other components in nuclear waste solutions the tap as used in the present work is highly selective for 99mtco4 over other anions in the nuclear waste solution this current method has shown the efficient separation of 99mtco4 using a minimum amount of carrier and doesn t generate secondary waste in the form of solvent this makes the process greener and economically viable however due to carrier leaching the reusability of the membrane was limited 4 conclusion the work describes the efficient separation of radioactive 99mtco4 from simulated nuclear waste solution using a highly selective supported liquid membrane based method high degree of selectivity has been obtained for 99mtco4 over all other major anionic components no3 co3 2 and oh present in nuclear waste solution the promising results as obtained from the current work indicate that this tap loaded membrane can further be explored for selectively removing tco4 from simulated nuclear waste solutions additionally this present work has also the potential to preconcentrate and hence volume reduction 99mtco4 by using a receiver compartment of lower volume than the feed compartment also the overall throughput of the present separation process can be increased by using a hollow fiber module configuration instead of a flat sheet one as reported in one of our earlier work 28 funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors acknowledgments authors thank dr s jeyakumar head

tetraphenylarsonium chloride however the efficacy of this reagent for selective removal of tco4 from aqueous nuclear waste streams has not been explored yet other than tco4 no3 is the major competing anion that is present in alkaline waste solution in alkaline intermediate level liquid waste ilw 17 99tco4 3 7 106 bq l is present along with 2 m no3 in solution this huge difference in the concentration makes their mutual separation really challenging with this in view in the present work an attempt has been made to address this challenging problem using tetraphenylarsonium chloride in polypropylene based slm the transport selectivity of 99mtco4 over no3 through this membrane has been studied in detail this carrier facilitated transport from feed to the receiver is based on the principle of ion exchange using a high concentration of another anion in the receiver compartment initially experiments have been carried out to optimize the receiver composition to obtain fast and complete transport of the ion of interest the decontamination factor df of 99mtco4 over no3 clo4 for different feed conditions has been determined nuclear waste solutions contain many anions other than 99mtco4 and no3 hence the transport selectivity has also been studied from a feed solution containing 99mtco4 no3 co3 2 and oh in the same ratio as is present in alkaline ilw 17 the stability of this membrane in terms of leaching of the carrier molecule has been studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and materials the 99mo activity was obtained from radiopharmaceutical division barc mumbai india the 99mtc radioactivity was extracted from a 99mo 99mtc radionuclide generator using a well established method as reported in the literature 36 all other reagents which have been used are of analytical grade the 0 1 m solutions of nacl nano3 liclo4 and na2so4 have been prepared by dissolving a known amount of the respective compound in 250 ml 18 2 mω cm deionized water the commercially available flat sheet polypropylene membrane was procured from membrana gmbh the average pore size and the thickness of the membrane were 0 2 μm and 90 μm respectively 2 2 preparation of membrane in order to increase the solubility of tetraphenylarsonium chloride in an organic medium it was converted into tetraphenylarsonium perchlorate tap form the polypropylene membrane was soaked with the ligand solution 0 015 g tap in 1 ml nitrobenzene and after complete soaking the excess of ligand solution was washed with a sufficient amount of deionized water this supported liquid membrane was subsequently used for the transport studies the carrier concentration in the membrane matrix is limited by the solubility of tap in the nitrobenzene 2 3 two compartment transport studies two compartment permeation experiments using these membranes for different feed and receiver compositions were carried out where the aim was to selectively transport 99mtco4 from the feed to the receiver compartment for this study a two compartment each of 13 5 ml glass cell with the membrane active surface area of 5 3 cm2 was used the details of the feed and receiver compositions for different transport experiments are listed in table 2 the solutions in both the compartments were stirred 350 rpm continuously to avoid any film controlled diffusion at the membrane interface in all the transport experiments 99mtco4 concentration in the feed was 3 7 106 bq l 17 the amount of 99mtco4 transferred from the feed to the receiver side was monitored by taking out 200 μl of aliquots from both the compartments at regular time intervals and counting in nai tl detector the transport of other anions no3 co3 2 was monitored by ion chromatography dionex dx 500 consisting of a self regenerator suppressor asrs ii and a conductivity detector ed 40 while the amount of oh transport was monitored by acid base titration all experiments were carried out at room temperature 300 k a fresh membrane fully loaded with the ligand solution was used for each experiment experiment 4 was repeated thrice with the same membrane to study the stability of the membrane in addition to the experiments mentioned in table 2 transport experiments were also carried out for a feed solution containing 99mtco4 3 7 106 bq l in a mixture of 0 2 m nano3 0 01 m na2co3 and 0 1 m naoh in this case the receiver solution contained 0 1 m liclo4 3 results and discussions this work describes carrier facilitated 37 transport of 99mtco4 using a slm where tetraphenylarsonium ion is the selective carrier for the target ion a pictorial representation of the principles involved in the pertechnetate transport from feed to the receiver compartment through tap loaded supported liquid membrane is shown in fig 1 at the feed solution membrane interphase the carrier selectively makes a 1 1 ionic associate 29 with the target ion transfer it across the membrane and releases it to the receiver phase in exchange of another counter ion in order to maintain electroneutrality in each compartment for every 99mtco4 transport from feed to receiver another counter anion cl no3 clo4 must be transported from receiver phase to feed phase fig 1 in order to obtain fast and complete transport of the ion of interest the receiver composition must be optimized for this two compartment transport experiments exp 1 4 were carried out with 3 7 106 bq l 99mtco4 in deionized water in feed compartment and 0 1 m solutions nano3 nacl liclo4 na2so4 in receiver compartment the 99mtco4 transport profiles as obtained from these experiments are shown in fig 2 it can be seen from the figure that the transport is fastest for clo4 and slowest for so4 2 with clo4 within 50 min 100 of 99mtco4 was transported to the receiver phase the 99mtco4 transport rate with no3 is almost comparable to that with clo4 in the presence of cl the rate was much slower and even after 3 5 h only 86 of 99mtco4 was transported to the receiver phase this rate decreased further in the presence of so4 2 in receiver compartment and after 3 5 h only 68 of 99mtco4 could be transported this particular trend in the 99mtco4 transport rate for different anions in the receiver compartment can be explained on the basis of two facts i partitioning of the exchanging anions between the aqueous receiver solution and the organic solvent in slm which is governed by their solubility in the organic solvent here nitrobenzene and ii diffusion of the anions in the membrane which is governed by their electrostatic interaction with the ion exchange groups in the membrane among all the 4 different anions clo4 no3 cl so4 2 studied clo4 has the highest tendency to dehydrate and hence has the highest partition coefficient in nitrobenzene also clo4 is known 26 to have similar hydration free energy and hydrated size to 99mtco4 the solubility of no3 in strong polar nitrobenzene dielectric constant 35 7 is almost comparable to that of clo4 while that of cl is much lower 29 as per the principle of ion exchange based facilitated transport the tco4 transport rate from feed to receiver will be governed by the transport of the exchanging anions from receiver to feed among clo4 no3 and cl all being univalent their solubility in organic solvent decides the final 99mtco4 transport rate on the other hand so4 2 has the least tendency to dehydrate and hence the least tendency to solubilize in nitrobenzene also because of its double charge its electrostatic interaction of ion exchange groups in the membrane is more than the rest univalent ions both these result in lowest 99mtco4 transport rate similar results were also reported by the authors 32 while testing adsorption and desorption of 99tc using different activated carbon columns they observed that desorption of 99mtco4 was maximum when 0 1 m naclo4 was used as eluent instead of naoh of similar concentration and they attributed this phenomenon to the structural similarity of clo4 with 99mtco4 in the present work though the transport rate for clo4 is almost comparable to that for no3 with 0 1 m nano3 in receiver compartment it will be impossible to determine the selectivity factor of tco4 over no3 henceforth unless otherwise stated all the transport studies have been done with 0 1 m liclo4 in the receiver compartment no3 is the major competing anion in the aqueous nuclear waste solution 17 in order to study the transport selectivity of 99mtco4 over no3 transport experiments exp 5 8 were done for 3 7 106 bq l 99mtco4 in presence of varying nano3 concentration 0 1 2 m in the feed compartment these compositions have been chosen to keep in mind the possible compositions of the intermediate level tc bearing waste ilw solution 17 the tco4 transport profiles obtained from these experiments are shown in fig 3 it indicates that in spite of the presence of high no3 concentration in the present work the transport rate of the anion of interest was very fast and for 0 1 m nano3 more than 99 of 99mtco4 was transported to the receiver compartment within 55 min in general the transport rate decreased with an increase in nano3 concentration due to increased competition of the ions for the carriers in the membrane however the difference between the transport rates in the presence of 1 5 m and 1 m nano3 was too small to be detected during the course of these fast processes in these two cases it took 2 h for 91 of 99mtco4 transport it is also to be noted that in presence of 2 m nano3 in feed complete transport of 90 of 99mtco4 to the receiver compartment was not possible in this particular case initially 74 of 99mtco4 was transported to the receiver phase within 43 min however after that due to the very high concentration of nitrate in feed 99mtco4 was getting back transported to feed on the receiver this back transport of 99mtco4 from receiver to feed was observed only for the highest nitrate concentration and not for other lower concentrations the tentative reason is explained below as seen from fig 2 no3 is exchangeable with clo4 in the membrane and hence is also transported to the receiver side along with 99mtco4 if the ion transport is limited by the ion exchange capacity of the membrane the larger is the amount to be transported the slower is the percentage transport rate at 2 m no3 concentration the ion transport may be taking place under saturation loading of the membrane condition limiting the rate of transport of ions as 99mtco4 is present in trace quantity only its percentage transport rate is still higher than that of no3 hence as the total amount to be transported is high even after 43 min a significant concentration of no3 still remains in the feed side which causes the 99mtco4 back transport from receiver to feed compartment for the lower no3 concentrations in feed because of much lower competition than the 2 m case the percentage tco4 transport rate is higher hence complete transport of 99mtco4 to the receiver is possible much before the remaining no3 in the feed compartment can cause its back transport to the feed compartment fig 4 is showing the comparison of the 99mtco4 and no3 transport profiles for two different nano3 concentrations exp 7 8 in the feed compartment the distinct difference in the percentage of transport rates of tco4 and no3 clearly indicates that the present slm is highly selective for 99mtco4 over no3 this behavior was similar to other nano3 concentration exp 5 6 too the transport rate of no3 is governed by the total number of ion exchange sites in the membrane and hence higher the total amount to be transported lower will be the percentage transport rate this explains the difference in the no3 transport rates for 0 1 m and 0 5 m nano3 in the feed the df of 99mtco4 over no3 as obtained from radioactivity measurement and ion chromatography has been calculated using the following equation d f t 99 m c o 4 t r a n s p o r t n o 3 t r a n s p o t in the present work the quoted df is always for 90 of 99mtco4 transport the results indicated that for all these experiments exp 5 8 99mtco4 was transported to the receiver compartment with a high degree of selectivity over no3 in general the df increases as no3 concentration decreases due to the lower competition and for 0 1 0 5 and 1 m nano3 the corresponding factors are 88 74 and 71 respectively for 2 m nano3 the df is not being quoted as complete 99mtco4 transport was not possible during the course of the experiment in order to study the stability of the membrane with respect to leaching of the carrier molecules experiment 8 was repeated thrice with the same membrane the 99mtco4 and no3 transport profiles obtained for these 3 repeat experiments are shown in fig 5 it can be seen from the figure that the percentage tco4 transport rate as well as the difference between the 99mtco4 and no3 transport rates decreased significantly in each repetition the df 88 of 99mtco4 over no3 as obtained with the fresh membrane exp 8 decreased to 4 4 and 2 5 in the next 2 consecutive repetitions it indicates that there is a significant amount of carrier leaching from the slm hence the performance of the membrane deteriorated in each repetition this is mostly because of the aqueous solubility of nitrobenzene however no better alternative solvent for tap could be found in order to study the leakage of neutral species through the membrane an experiment exp 10 was carried out for a feed solution containing 3 7 106 bq l 99mtco4 in presence of 0 1 m nano3 and a receiver solution containing deionized water it was observed that even after 7 h only 0 16 of no3 and hence same of na was transported to the receiver while the 99mtco4 transport to the receiver was below the detection limit of the radioactive counting instrument this indicates that the leakage of neutral species through the membrane is negligible and ionic interaction with the tetraphenylarsonium ion fig 1 is the only route of 99mtco4 transport as discussed previously in the majority of the experiments 0 1 m liclo4 was used as the reagent in the receiver compartment hence in order to study the mutual selectivity between 99mtco4 and clo4 transport experiment exp 9 was also carried out for 99mtco4 3 7 106 bq l and clo4 0 1 m in feed and 0 1 m nano3 in receiver compartment the tco4 and clo4 transport profiles obtained for this experiment are shown in fig 6 it can be seen from the figure that in presence of clo4 in the feed solution the 99mtco4 transport rate was too slow as compared to those in the previous cases with no3 and after 7 5 h only 38 of 99mtco4 was transported to the receiver compartment however the membrane was still selective for 99mtco4 and after 7 5 h only 0 03 of clo4 was transported to the receiver compartment the slower 99mtco4 transport rate in presence of clo4 in feed is mostly because of the significant competition between tco4 and clo4 for the tap sites in the membrane this transport experiment was not continued till 100 of 99mtco4 transport as the membrane quality significantly degrades in case of prolonged use cf previous section additionally the transport selectivity of 99mtco4 over co3 2 and oh was also studied for this the feed solution composition was chosen based on the relevant literature 17 as reported by d banerjee et al 17 the 99tc bearing nuclear waste solution contains mostly no3 2 m oh 1 m and co3 2 0 1 m as the major competing anions however it was observed in our previous experiments that complete 99mtco4 transport is not possible in the presence of 2 m nano3 in the feed hence in the present work the reported 17 anion concentrations were diluted 10 times and the transport selectivity of 99mtco4 was studied from a solution containing 0 2 m no3 0 1 m oh and 0 01 m co3 2 the receiver compartment contained 0 1 m liclo4 it is to be noted that the other elements cs sr and ru etc in the 99tc bearing nuclear waste solution 17 are present in cationic form and hence will not interfere in 99mtco4 transport in this experiment within 80 min complete 99mtco4 transport was possible and at the end of the transport the decontamination factor of the ion of interest over no3 oh and co3 2 were108 42 and 25 respectively in addition to this there is also a possibility to preconcentrate 99mtco4 by using a receiver compartment of lower volume than the feed compartment the flux of an ion across the membrane is driven by its concentration gradient between the feed and the receiver compartment hence if the compartment volumes are changed e g feed to receiver volume ratio become 100 1 instead of 1 1 keeping the membrane area and the ion concentration fixed the flux will and hence the fundamental principles involved in the process will remain unchanged however with an increase in the feed volume the total amount of 99mtco4 to be transported increases hence the total transport time for 90 transport of 99mtco4 will increase in that case a bigger membrane surface area can be used to reduce the total transport time in one of our previous work 38 similar cell design was applied for effective preconcentration as well as selective transport of cs from nuclear waste solution in order to compare the present results with those from the literature the results from the present work are also shown in table 1 the advantages of the present membrane based method over the conventional separation methods are previously discussed in the introduction section among the membrane based literature other than the work of r chiarizia 23 the present method is the only efficient and quick within 60 min report on the separation of tco4 from aqueous waste solutions while the primary amine carriers used by r chiarizia 23 have no selectivity over other components in nuclear waste solutions the tap as used in the present work is highly selective for 99mtco4 over other anions in the nuclear waste solution this current method has shown the efficient separation of 99mtco4 using a minimum amount of carrier and doesn t generate secondary waste in the form of solvent this makes the process greener and economically viable however due to carrier leaching the reusability of the membrane was limited 4 conclusion the work describes the efficient separation of radioactive 99mtco4 from simulated nuclear waste solution using a highly selective supported liquid membrane based method high degree of selectivity has been obtained for 99mtco4 over all other major anionic components no3 co3 2 and oh present in nuclear waste solution the promising results as obtained from the current work indicate that this tap loaded membrane can further be explored for selectively removing tco4 from simulated nuclear waste solutions additionally this present work has also the potential to preconcentrate and hence volume reduction 99mtco4 by using a receiver compartment of lower volume than the feed compartment also the overall throughput of the present separation process can be increased by using a hollow fiber module configuration instead of a flat sheet one as reported in one of our earlier work 28 funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors acknowledgments authors thank dr s jeyakumar head

14373,due to the global rising demand there is an enormous interest to recover noble metals most efficiently from aqueous solutions in particular industrial wastewater herein we demonstrate a new concept to recover ag and au from sulfate chlorine and nitrate containing waters e g from catalysis production therefore two different treatment procedures called 2 step ferritization and lt delafossite process are presented which are based on a modified ferrite process the phase assemblage can be controlled by the adjustment of the reaction parameters during the 2 step ferritization process ag0 and au0 are precipitated within one separate step the precipitated phases obtained by the lt delafossite process are pure delafossite agfeo2 and composite particles of ag0 agfeo2 and fe3o4 by using these low energy fast 20 min and easy to handle precipitation processes ag and au can be recovered to 99 99 from wastewater in consequence these procedures help to avoid additional waste streams keywords silver gold precipitation recovery zero valent metals 1 introduction au and ag are precious metals and have been in use since the ancient past for the production of jewelry and coins nowadays they are needed for manifold technical electronic and electrical equipment as well as medical applications 1 2 ag is used for example as contacts in transmission voltage switchgear on microprocessors and in crystalline and thin film silicon cells 1 besides electronic devices au has become increasingly important as catalyst 3 due to the global rising demand it becomes more decisive to recover the noble metals from this inevitably increasing urban mine 4 the recovery of the noble metals is only reasonable if the recovery is cost effective 5 noble metals are typically recovered by hydrometallurgical or pyro metallurgical processes 2 pyrometallurgical processes are conventional methods to recover gold 2 however it is entailed with high energy consumption 6 hydrometallurgical processes are based on dissolving noble metals by acid or caustic leachates afterwards there are manifold approaches to treat the solutions for example by cementation precipitation electrolytic recovery solvent extraction ion exchange reductive exchange adsorption and recently bio hydrometallurgy including bio oxidation and bio sorption 2 7 however the manifold studies mainly performed at lab scale involve limitations that hinder the adaption of the technologies in recovery of noble elements 2 8 most methods need either partly toxic reagents are time and high energy consuming or the recovery rate is too low for example the cementation process proposed by kuntyi and co workers to recover silver needs a thiocyanate solution 9 in general as a result a significant amount of secondary waste is produced 10 adsorption on activated carbon is one of the commonly used processes in industry to recover noble metals out of solutions 7 this method is characterized by high selectivity and high efficiency but the adsorption of ag and au on activated carbon is complex and time consuming 11 12 furthermore physical and chemical properties of the activated coal strongly affect the au absorption 11 the voluminous carbon has to be treated by incineration to recover the pure metals 7 due to the increase of noble metal containing wastewater streams alternateve sources for activated carbon need to be found 11 aim of this study is to test the applicability of precipitation processes using fe to recover au and ag from aqueous solutions in order to avoid secondary waste this work is based on ferritization process 12 and the low temperature lt delafossite process 13 14 both the ferritization process and the lt delafossite process use metastable phases especially green rust gr as precursor phase to form ferrite and delafossite at alkaline conditions 12 14 15 gr is a fe2 fe3 double layered hydroxysulphate nitrate which acts as strong reducing agent herein we present a 2 step ferritization procedure to gain pure zero valent ag0 and au0 furthermore we modified the lt delafossite process in order to recover ag as delafossite agfeo2 from ag loaded aqueous solutions gong and coworkers as well as krehula and musić studied the synthesis of such nanocrystalline ag phases due to their possible applications as antiviral and antibacterial magnetic materials and sensors 16 17 2 material and methods 2 1 wastewaters we tested the 2 step ferritization and or the delafossite process using either synthetic or real wastewater for preparation of ag containing synthetic wastewater hydrated ag2so4 ag1 and ag2 or agno3 ag3 was dissolved in 150 ml water with high purity 5 μs cm after reaching a homogeneous solution water with high purity was added to a final volume of 200 ml in total the resulting ag concentrations of the synthetic wastewaters were 5 g l ag for sample ag1 1 g l ag for sample ag2 and 1 g l ag for sample ag3 with these concentrations and matrix anions we want to match different ag containing activation baths and rinsing waters from ag plating industry the occurrence of cyanides in many of these waters is neglected for this very first study in addition an alkaline au containing concentrated wastewater from catalysis production was provided by our industrial partner clariant ag the wastewater was diluted until an au concentration of 1 8 g l was reached using water with high purity furthermore the sample was acidified to ph 2 1 using h2so4 and hcl for stabilization all chemicals used for wastewater production or acidification were from vwr analytical grade the chemical composition of the four different waters are summarized in table 1 2 2 experimental setups herein two different experimental setups one for performing the lt delafossite experiments and one for the 2 step ferritization process were used all chemicals used in the experiments were from vwr analytical grade for ph measurements and adjustments a titrator tl 7000 from si analytics was used all the precipitates were washed 3 times with water 5 μs cm and dried at room temperature for 12 h 2 2 1 the 2 step ferritization process first hydrated feso4 was added to the wastewater the mole ratio of fe au and fe ag was 3 1 and 1 1 respectively afterwards the precipitated product was removed from the solution step 1 either via filtration fig 1 or by removing the glass substrate fig 2 from the reaction solution under continuous stirring the remaining solution was alkalized to a ph of 10 5 using naoh the ph of the suspension was kept 9 for 10 min to promote phase transition of the primary precipitations to oxides then the precipitates were removed from the solution again step 2 the reaction temperature was 20 c for au and 70 c for ag fig 1 shows the detailed treatment process for au containing wastewater fig 2 illustrates the modified process using glass substrates to remove ag during step 1 2 2 2 the lt delafossite process the ag containing solution was heated to a reaction temperature of 70 c and kept continuously stirred and heated afterwards hydrated feso4 or fe no3 3 was added to the sulfate or nitrate containing synthetic wastewater respectively the mole ratio of fe ag was 1 1 by adding naoh the ph was raised 9 after reaching a ph of 9 the purified wastewater was separated from the remaining solution containing the precipitates then the suspension was further alkalized up to ph 11 and kept ph 9 for 5 min the detailed experimental setup is shown in fig 3 modified after 15 an aliquot of the solution containing the precipitates were aged in a closed vessel for 24 h at 70 c an elevated temperature of 70 c during the whole experiment was chosen in order to promote the phase transformation of primary precipitation products as gr or ferrihydrite to delafossite structure 14 2 3 methods atom absorption spectrometry aas analyses were used to determine the ag concentration in the synthetic wastewater and the precipitates the measurements were carried out using a spectra aa220 from agilent technology department of earth and environmental siences dees ludwig maximilians universität lmu münchen ag was measured at wavelength 328 1 at a slit width of 0 5 nm the chemistry of the au wastewater was analyzed before and after wastewater treatment by the industrial partner using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes from spectro arcos table 2 summarizes the measuring parameters furthermore measurements with a high detection limit have been performed by the bavarian environment agency using an icp ms type agilent 7500cx the measuring conditions are listed in table 3 phase identification was conducted by x ray powder diffraction xrd xrd data were collected on a ge diffractometer xrd 3003 tt dees section crystallography lmu using cu kα1 radiation on zero background quartz holders energies below 7 9 kev were filtered out to minimize fluorescence the sample holders were rotated during the data collection for better counting statistics qualitative phase identification was conducted by comparison of xrd data with the data bank inorganic crystal structure database on its user interface program findit 18 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir was used to identify low crystalline and amorphous phases therefore 1 mg sample was mixed with 200 mg kbr and pressed into pellets the spectra were recorded on an equinox55 spectrometer from bruker dees section mineralogy lmu the measurement conditions were 64 scans from 360 to 4000 cm 1 with a scan time of 4 s raw spectra were baseline corrected before fitting absorption bands using the software peakfit phase identification was solely done by fingerprint method based on spectra of rruff database 19 in case of agfeo2 additional literature references were used scanning electron microscopy sem measurements were carried out with the nanosam lab from scienta omicron department experimentalphysik ii universität augsburg using a uhv gemini column with an ultimate resolution of 3 nm all images were taken at 10 kv beam energy a beam current of 100 pa and a working distance of 5 mm with the in lens detector transmission electron microscopy tem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds analyses were carried out using a jeol jem 2100f department experimentalphysik ii universität augsburg equipped both with a gatan imaging filter for energy filtered microscopy and an edax eds detector for recording eds spectra samples were pre treated with isopropanol to avoid clustering and then prepared on cu grids for au samples to avoid au signals from the grid in eds measurements and on au grids for ag samples particle size and shape investigations were carried out in the imaging mode supplemented by electron diffraction for structural analysis electron diffraction patterns were recorded using the image plate scanner system ditabis 3 results and discussion during this study a large range of experiments were performed by varying the reaction conditions as the initial ag 0 3 5 g l or au 0 83 1 8 g l concentration added amount of fe ph value 9 11 reaction and ageing temperature 20 90 c as well as ageing time fresh 2 days with the goal to produce hydroxide free valuable final products from the wastewaters herein we present four of the successfully implemented experimental series in more detail using two different precipitation procedures called lt delafossite process and 2 step ferritization table 4 3 1 wastewater purification table 5 summarizes the concentrations of ag or au for the initial wastewaters and after treatment during this study different dilutions of initial samples au1 and ag1 3 leading to final concentrations of ag 0 3 g l 5 g l and au 0 83 g l 1 8 g l were treated successfully the recovery rate was 99 87 in all cases under here in detail presented optimized conditions a water purification rate 99 99 was achieved using both the 2 step ferritization or the lt delafossite process for wastewater au1 and solution ag1 3 in comparison using electrochemical processes from the waste solutions of ag ag2 redox in nitric acid medium recovery efficiency for ag was 99 20 8 the utilization of carbon adsorbent based on anthracite enabled an ag purification better than 90 and 87 88 for thiosulphate and thiocyanate solutions respectively 21 8 after cyanidation bio oxidation of au concentrates using extremophiles rendered a maximum au recovery of 92 22 2 the utilization of activated carbon enabled purification rates 98 15 up to nearly 100 using optimal conditions 11 2 biosorption gains purification rates of 90 98 2 for initial concentrations between 5 mg l and 500 mgll au 23 25 cementation and solvent extraction is used from initial concentrations of 2 mg l 2 g l reaching very high purification rates 98 5 to almost 100 for low concentrations as 20 mgl 26 28 3 2 characterization of precipitated products 3 2 1 characterization of residues obtained by 2 step ferritization process ferritization process was introduced to treat lab wastewater especially loaded with low concentrations up to 1 g l transition metals 29 32 since then there have been performed many studies dealing with the ferrite process in order to incorporate transition elements especially zn cu or ni into the ferrite structure 33 37 in 2016 the ferrite process was used in order to co precipitate cu0 in addition to pure magnetite 12 however a separation of single phases from the precipitated phase mixture was not possible 12 based on this modified ferritization process we developed a 2 step ferritization procedure in order to gain a zero valent noble metal as a single phased product in a separate wastewater treatment step as far as we know there is no other research on ferritization approaches to recover noble metals from aqueous solutions as industrial wastewater 3 2 2 wastewater au1 fig 4 a shows an x ray diffraction pattern of the residues obtained for wastewater au1 after step1 and step2 using the 2 step ferritization process the precipitates after the addition of fe2 step 1 exclusively contain 1 5 4 μm large rosette shaped particles fig 4b the only crystalline phase in the precipitated material is au0 fig 4a edx measurements on numerous particles solely showed a strong au signal due to ftir analysis we can exclude for potentially co precipitated phases especially usually low crystalline or amorphous fe hydroxides after separating the au0 rosettes from the reaction solution and the following alkalization step2 the precipitated residues contain magnetite as major phase additionally a small amount of au0 is observable with xrd fig 4c edx measurements on randomly selected magnetite crystals showed an atomic ratio fe o of 3 4 which is in line with the results from xrd analysis additionally a very weak au signal was detectable indicating either a co precipitation of au0 or an adsorption of zero valent au on the surface of the 5 20 nm large magnetites our investigations showed that the separation of au0 after step 1 is mandatory in order to gain magnetite during step 2 it must be performed carefully as a missed or incomplete separation promotes the formation of goethite instead of magnetite 3 2 3 ag wastewater with high concentration ag1 using wastewater ag1 we obtained ag0 deposited on a glass substrate the x ray diffraction pattern of the material is shown in fig 5 the deposited film exclusively consists of ag0 sg 225 fm 3m no impurities of any fe containing phases such as ferrite delafossite or hydroxides were detected during alkalization step 2 a fe phase with strong magnetic properties was precipitated x ray diffraction analyses and ftir measurements confirm fe3o4 as a single phase no low crystalline fe hydroxides or green rust gr are detected the bulk chemistry of the precipitated powder analyzed by aas shows that the nanoparticles contain 0 1 mg l ag edx measurements confirm a homogeneous distribution of ag on the fe phase both an adsorption of ag on the surface of nano crystalline magnetites or even incorporation of very small amounts of ag into the crystal lattice of magnetite is possible 3 2 4 supposed mechanisms and advantages our results show that already the addition of fe2 sulfate to the solution evokes the reduction of both au3 and also ag in high concentrated ag wastewater 5 g l ag this is the main stage leading to the formation of zero valent au and ag the next step alkalization of the solution results in the formation of metastable phases as e g gr or fe hydroxides the subsequent transformation to magnetite during ph stat time and ageing leads to further reduction of the remaining au3 and ag the very fast oxidation of the precursor phases to fe3o4 is advanced by electron exchange in the presence of au3 or ag ions the reduction of ag to ag0 by gr is already presented by óloughlin et al 38 our study points out that the optimal treatment for au and highly loaded ag wastewaters is the treatment using the 2 step ferritization process the benefit of this technique is the easy separation of μm sized au0 particles or ag0 foil from the fe containing solution and the separate precipitation of nano crystalline magnetite 3 2 5 characterization of nanoparticles obtained by lt delafossite process on the basis of the well known ferrite process e g 29 37 and hydrothermal approaches to synthesize delafossite e g 39 the lt delafossite process was developed in 2016 to synthesize cufeo2 13 14 and to purify cu rich aqueous solutions and real industrial wastewater from electroplating industry at the same time 15 the delafossite process was used to purify wastewater from ni fe cr zn and sn however the delafossite process was not used to treat noble metal containing solutions up to now 3 2 5 1 ag wastewater with low concentration ag2 in fig 6 the x ray diffraction patterns of the fresh and 24 h aged residues obtained after the treatment of wastewater ag2 by lt delafossite process are presented both samples show strong reflections of ag0 sg 225 fm 3m additionally very broad peaks with low intensity assigned to ferrite sg 227 fd 3m are observable the high intensity of ag0 reflections and the low intensity of the ferrite peaks may be attributed to a shell of ag0 around nano crystalline ferrite particles a similar effect is postulated by gong and coworkers 16 the reflection intensities assigned to ferrite are in the fresh sample higher compared to the 24 h aged sample indicating an increased crystallinity of ag with ageing time ftir analyses show no characteristic absorbance bands of gr a typical precursor phase of ferrite or delafossite 12 14 15 or any fe hydroxides fig 7 but strong bands at 429 563 and 623 cm 1 and a very weak one at 705 cm 1 the absorbance band at 563 cm 1 is attributed to ag ferrite the incorporation of ag in the magnetite structure is assumed to shift the typical position of magnetite at 580 cm 1 to the lower value the two bands positioned around 620 and 430 cm 1 can be assigned to agfeo2 17 in comparison to the fresh residue the intensity of these bands decreases for the 24 h aged sample see enlarged section in fig 7 the bulk chemical composition of the precipitated phases was analyzed by aas for both fresh and aged sample the mole ratio of ag fe is almost 1 1 additionally eds measurements on various randomly selected points were performed in general two types of composite particles can be distinguished in the samples fe rich particles type abc containing 0 8 ag and 25 47 fe and ag rich particles type def containing 25 40 ag and 16 25 fe in the tem image in fig 8 the abc particles appear lighter and the def particles darker fig 8a shows additionally the diffraction pattern of the area marked in green the bright rings can be assigned to ferrite and ag0 additionally very weak reflections related to agfeo2 can be observed it was not possible to take individual electron diffraction patterns of the single phases it is probably caused by the overlapping of the 2 20 nm small particles or partially inter grown nano spheres the hr tem images in fig 8 with d spacings of particle type abc however indicate the formation of fe3o4 our results show that it is not possible to precipitate single phased agfeo2 with delafossite structure at 70 c by the lt delafossite process using sulfate salts as reactants this is probably the effect of divalent fe2 which easily reduces ag the reduction of ag to its zero valent state by gr was already observed during the ferritization process this study 3 2 1 and described 2003 by óloughlin et al 38 3 2 5 2 ag wastewater with low concentrations using nitrates as reactants ag3 due to the observed strong reducing potential of fe2 in sulfate solutions we investigated additional experiments using nitrates as reactants with the aim to synthesize agfeo2 with delafossite structure it is aligned to the hydrothermal route presented by xiong and coworkers to synthesize agalo2 by using al no3 3 and agno3 as reactants 40 they describe the reaction of ag2o with alooh to form agalo2 under alkaline conditions murthy and co authors synthesized agfeo2 in 2011 by precipitation reaction from nitrate containing solution at ph 11 12 with a high temperature after treatment between 400 and 900 c 41 fig 9 shows the x ray diffraction pattern of the fresh precipitates obtained from ag3 the synthesized material contains both polytypes of agfeo2 3r delafossite and 2h delafossite ftir analysis expose exclusively absorption bands assigned to agfeo2 polytypes whereas characteristic bands of co precipitated fe hydroxides are not observable agfeo2 mainly crystallizes in hexagonal plates up to 50 nm size and most of the crystals show a very high amount of dislocations fig 10 a both bulk chemistry measurements by aas and numerous edx analysis fig 10b confirmed an atomic ratio ag fe of 1 1 in the sample in contrast to the delafossite process synthesizing cufeo2 13 15 and agfeo2 production using high temperature 400 c after treatment 41 herein agfeo2 is spontaneously formed with start of the precipitation reaction and ageing has no further effect 4 conclusion our two different treatment processes are feasible to recover ag and au from sulfate and nitrate containing wastewaters with initial metal concentrations from 0 3 g l up to 5 g l the precipitated phases are directly controllable by the reaction parameters as e g initial metal concentration temperature amount of added fe and alkalization conditions the procedures provide following benefits ag and au can be recovered to 99 99 from wastewater at optimized conditions ag and au can be precipitated as zero valent phases and can easily be removed from the solution after the fe2 addition step in a separate step during alkalization of the fe rich solution magnetite precipitates it is possible to synthesize various ag products as single phased delafossite agfeo2 or composite particles of ag0 together with delafossite or fe3o4 ag and au precipitate as zero valent metals or as valuable phases which can be used in industrial applications fast 20 min easy to handle treatment process using this process prevents secondary waste streams therefore energy intensive incineration can be avoided funding sources this study was supported by the bavarian state

14373,due to the global rising demand there is an enormous interest to recover noble metals most efficiently from aqueous solutions in particular industrial wastewater herein we demonstrate a new concept to recover ag and au from sulfate chlorine and nitrate containing waters e g from catalysis production therefore two different treatment procedures called 2 step ferritization and lt delafossite process are presented which are based on a modified ferrite process the phase assemblage can be controlled by the adjustment of the reaction parameters during the 2 step ferritization process ag0 and au0 are precipitated within one separate step the precipitated phases obtained by the lt delafossite process are pure delafossite agfeo2 and composite particles of ag0 agfeo2 and fe3o4 by using these low energy fast 20 min and easy to handle precipitation processes ag and au can be recovered to 99 99 from wastewater in consequence these procedures help to avoid additional waste streams keywords silver gold precipitation recovery zero valent metals 1 introduction au and ag are precious metals and have been in use since the ancient past for the production of jewelry and coins nowadays they are needed for manifold technical electronic and electrical equipment as well as medical applications 1 2 ag is used for example as contacts in transmission voltage switchgear on microprocessors and in crystalline and thin film silicon cells 1 besides electronic devices au has become increasingly important as catalyst 3 due to the global rising demand it becomes more decisive to recover the noble metals from this inevitably increasing urban mine 4 the recovery of the noble metals is only reasonable if the recovery is cost effective 5 noble metals are typically recovered by hydrometallurgical or pyro metallurgical processes 2 pyrometallurgical processes are conventional methods to recover gold 2 however it is entailed with high energy consumption 6 hydrometallurgical processes are based on dissolving noble metals by acid or caustic leachates afterwards there are manifold approaches to treat the solutions for example by cementation precipitation electrolytic recovery solvent extraction ion exchange reductive exchange adsorption and recently bio hydrometallurgy including bio oxidation and bio sorption 2 7 however the manifold studies mainly performed at lab scale involve limitations that hinder the adaption of the technologies in recovery of noble elements 2 8 most methods need either partly toxic reagents are time and high energy consuming or the recovery rate is too low for example the cementation process proposed by kuntyi and co workers to recover silver needs a thiocyanate solution 9 in general as a result a significant amount of secondary waste is produced 10 adsorption on activated carbon is one of the commonly used processes in industry to recover noble metals out of solutions 7 this method is characterized by high selectivity and high efficiency but the adsorption of ag and au on activated carbon is complex and time consuming 11 12 furthermore physical and chemical properties of the activated coal strongly affect the au absorption 11 the voluminous carbon has to be treated by incineration to recover the pure metals 7 due to the increase of noble metal containing wastewater streams alternateve sources for activated carbon need to be found 11 aim of this study is to test the applicability of precipitation processes using fe to recover au and ag from aqueous solutions in order to avoid secondary waste this work is based on ferritization process 12 and the low temperature lt delafossite process 13 14 both the ferritization process and the lt delafossite process use metastable phases especially green rust gr as precursor phase to form ferrite and delafossite at alkaline conditions 12 14 15 gr is a fe2 fe3 double layered hydroxysulphate nitrate which acts as strong reducing agent herein we present a 2 step ferritization procedure to gain pure zero valent ag0 and au0 furthermore we modified the lt delafossite process in order to recover ag as delafossite agfeo2 from ag loaded aqueous solutions gong and coworkers as well as krehula and musić studied the synthesis of such nanocrystalline ag phases due to their possible applications as antiviral and antibacterial magnetic materials and sensors 16 17 2 material and methods 2 1 wastewaters we tested the 2 step ferritization and or the delafossite process using either synthetic or real wastewater for preparation of ag containing synthetic wastewater hydrated ag2so4 ag1 and ag2 or agno3 ag3 was dissolved in 150 ml water with high purity 5 μs cm after reaching a homogeneous solution water with high purity was added to a final volume of 200 ml in total the resulting ag concentrations of the synthetic wastewaters were 5 g l ag for sample ag1 1 g l ag for sample ag2 and 1 g l ag for sample ag3 with these concentrations and matrix anions we want to match different ag containing activation baths and rinsing waters from ag plating industry the occurrence of cyanides in many of these waters is neglected for this very first study in addition an alkaline au containing concentrated wastewater from catalysis production was provided by our industrial partner clariant ag the wastewater was diluted until an au concentration of 1 8 g l was reached using water with high purity furthermore the sample was acidified to ph 2 1 using h2so4 and hcl for stabilization all chemicals used for wastewater production or acidification were from vwr analytical grade the chemical composition of the four different waters are summarized in table 1 2 2 experimental setups herein two different experimental setups one for performing the lt delafossite experiments and one for the 2 step ferritization process were used all chemicals used in the experiments were from vwr analytical grade for ph measurements and adjustments a titrator tl 7000 from si analytics was used all the precipitates were washed 3 times with water 5 μs cm and dried at room temperature for 12 h 2 2 1 the 2 step ferritization process first hydrated feso4 was added to the wastewater the mole ratio of fe au and fe ag was 3 1 and 1 1 respectively afterwards the precipitated product was removed from the solution step 1 either via filtration fig 1 or by removing the glass substrate fig 2 from the reaction solution under continuous stirring the remaining solution was alkalized to a ph of 10 5 using naoh the ph of the suspension was kept 9 for 10 min to promote phase transition of the primary precipitations to oxides then the precipitates were removed from the solution again step 2 the reaction temperature was 20 c for au and 70 c for ag fig 1 shows the detailed treatment process for au containing wastewater fig 2 illustrates the modified process using glass substrates to remove ag during step 1 2 2 2 the lt delafossite process the ag containing solution was heated to a reaction temperature of 70 c and kept continuously stirred and heated afterwards hydrated feso4 or fe no3 3 was added to the sulfate or nitrate containing synthetic wastewater respectively the mole ratio of fe ag was 1 1 by adding naoh the ph was raised 9 after reaching a ph of 9 the purified wastewater was separated from the remaining solution containing the precipitates then the suspension was further alkalized up to ph 11 and kept ph 9 for 5 min the detailed experimental setup is shown in fig 3 modified after 15 an aliquot of the solution containing the precipitates were aged in a closed vessel for 24 h at 70 c an elevated temperature of 70 c during the whole experiment was chosen in order to promote the phase transformation of primary precipitation products as gr or ferrihydrite to delafossite structure 14 2 3 methods atom absorption spectrometry aas analyses were used to determine the ag concentration in the synthetic wastewater and the precipitates the measurements were carried out using a spectra aa220 from agilent technology department of earth and environmental siences dees ludwig maximilians universität lmu münchen ag was measured at wavelength 328 1 at a slit width of 0 5 nm the chemistry of the au wastewater was analyzed before and after wastewater treatment by the industrial partner using an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes from spectro arcos table 2 summarizes the measuring parameters furthermore measurements with a high detection limit have been performed by the bavarian environment agency using an icp ms type agilent 7500cx the measuring conditions are listed in table 3 phase identification was conducted by x ray powder diffraction xrd xrd data were collected on a ge diffractometer xrd 3003 tt dees section crystallography lmu using cu kα1 radiation on zero background quartz holders energies below 7 9 kev were filtered out to minimize fluorescence the sample holders were rotated during the data collection for better counting statistics qualitative phase identification was conducted by comparison of xrd data with the data bank inorganic crystal structure database on its user interface program findit 18 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir was used to identify low crystalline and amorphous phases therefore 1 mg sample was mixed with 200 mg kbr and pressed into pellets the spectra were recorded on an equinox55 spectrometer from bruker dees section mineralogy lmu the measurement conditions were 64 scans from 360 to 4000 cm 1 with a scan time of 4 s raw spectra were baseline corrected before fitting absorption bands using the software peakfit phase identification was solely done by fingerprint method based on spectra of rruff database 19 in case of agfeo2 additional literature references were used scanning electron microscopy sem measurements were carried out with the nanosam lab from scienta omicron department experimentalphysik ii universität augsburg using a uhv gemini column with an ultimate resolution of 3 nm all images were taken at 10 kv beam energy a beam current of 100 pa and a working distance of 5 mm with the in lens detector transmission electron microscopy tem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds analyses were carried out using a jeol jem 2100f department experimentalphysik ii universität augsburg equipped both with a gatan imaging filter for energy filtered microscopy and an edax eds detector for recording eds spectra samples were pre treated with isopropanol to avoid clustering and then prepared on cu grids for au samples to avoid au signals from the grid in eds measurements and on au grids for ag samples particle size and shape investigations were carried out in the imaging mode supplemented by electron diffraction for structural analysis electron diffraction patterns were recorded using the image plate scanner system ditabis 3 results and discussion during this study a large range of experiments were performed by varying the reaction conditions as the initial ag 0 3 5 g l or au 0 83 1 8 g l concentration added amount of fe ph value 9 11 reaction and ageing temperature 20 90 c as well as ageing time fresh 2 days with the goal to produce hydroxide free valuable final products from the wastewaters herein we present four of the successfully implemented experimental series in more detail using two different precipitation procedures called lt delafossite process and 2 step ferritization table 4 3 1 wastewater purification table 5 summarizes the concentrations of ag or au for the initial wastewaters and after treatment during this study different dilutions of initial samples au1 and ag1 3 leading to final concentrations of ag 0 3 g l 5 g l and au 0 83 g l 1 8 g l were treated successfully the recovery rate was 99 87 in all cases under here in detail presented optimized conditions a water purification rate 99 99 was achieved using both the 2 step ferritization or the lt delafossite process for wastewater au1 and solution ag1 3 in comparison using electrochemical processes from the waste solutions of ag ag2 redox in nitric acid medium recovery efficiency for ag was 99 20 8 the utilization of carbon adsorbent based on anthracite enabled an ag purification better than 90 and 87 88 for thiosulphate and thiocyanate solutions respectively 21 8 after cyanidation bio oxidation of au concentrates using extremophiles rendered a maximum au recovery of 92 22 2 the utilization of activated carbon enabled purification rates 98 15 up to nearly 100 using optimal conditions 11 2 biosorption gains purification rates of 90 98 2 for initial concentrations between 5 mg l and 500 mgll au 23 25 cementation and solvent extraction is used from initial concentrations of 2 mg l 2 g l reaching very high purification rates 98 5 to almost 100 for low concentrations as 20 mgl 26 28 3 2 characterization of precipitated products 3 2 1 characterization of residues obtained by 2 step ferritization process ferritization process was introduced to treat lab wastewater especially loaded with low concentrations up to 1 g l transition metals 29 32 since then there have been performed many studies dealing with the ferrite process in order to incorporate transition elements especially zn cu or ni into the ferrite structure 33 37 in 2016 the ferrite process was used in order to co precipitate cu0 in addition to pure magnetite 12 however a separation of single phases from the precipitated phase mixture was not possible 12 based on this modified ferritization process we developed a 2 step ferritization procedure in order to gain a zero valent noble metal as a single phased product in a separate wastewater treatment step as far as we know there is no other research on ferritization approaches to recover noble metals from aqueous solutions as industrial wastewater 3 2 2 wastewater au1 fig 4 a shows an x ray diffraction pattern of the residues obtained for wastewater au1 after step1 and step2 using the 2 step ferritization process the precipitates after the addition of fe2 step 1 exclusively contain 1 5 4 μm large rosette shaped particles fig 4b the only crystalline phase in the precipitated material is au0 fig 4a edx measurements on numerous particles solely showed a strong au signal due to ftir analysis we can exclude for potentially co precipitated phases especially usually low crystalline or amorphous fe hydroxides after separating the au0 rosettes from the reaction solution and the following alkalization step2 the precipitated residues contain magnetite as major phase additionally a small amount of au0 is observable with xrd fig 4c edx measurements on randomly selected magnetite crystals showed an atomic ratio fe o of 3 4 which is in line with the results from xrd analysis additionally a very weak au signal was detectable indicating either a co precipitation of au0 or an adsorption of zero valent au on the surface of the 5 20 nm large magnetites our investigations showed that the separation of au0 after step 1 is mandatory in order to gain magnetite during step 2 it must be performed carefully as a missed or incomplete separation promotes the formation of goethite instead of magnetite 3 2 3 ag wastewater with high concentration ag1 using wastewater ag1 we obtained ag0 deposited on a glass substrate the x ray diffraction pattern of the material is shown in fig 5 the deposited film exclusively consists of ag0 sg 225 fm 3m no impurities of any fe containing phases such as ferrite delafossite or hydroxides were detected during alkalization step 2 a fe phase with strong magnetic properties was precipitated x ray diffraction analyses and ftir measurements confirm fe3o4 as a single phase no low crystalline fe hydroxides or green rust gr are detected the bulk chemistry of the precipitated powder analyzed by aas shows that the nanoparticles contain 0 1 mg l ag edx measurements confirm a homogeneous distribution of ag on the fe phase both an adsorption of ag on the surface of nano crystalline magnetites or even incorporation of very small amounts of ag into the crystal lattice of magnetite is possible 3 2 4 supposed mechanisms and advantages our results show that already the addition of fe2 sulfate to the solution evokes the reduction of both au3 and also ag in high concentrated ag wastewater 5 g l ag this is the main stage leading to the formation of zero valent au and ag the next step alkalization of the solution results in the formation of metastable phases as e g gr or fe hydroxides the subsequent transformation to magnetite during ph stat time and ageing leads to further reduction of the remaining au3 and ag the very fast oxidation of the precursor phases to fe3o4 is advanced by electron exchange in the presence of au3 or ag ions the reduction of ag to ag0 by gr is already presented by óloughlin et al 38 our study points out that the optimal treatment for au and highly loaded ag wastewaters is the treatment using the 2 step ferritization process the benefit of this technique is the easy separation of μm sized au0 particles or ag0 foil from the fe containing solution and the separate precipitation of nano crystalline magnetite 3 2 5 characterization of nanoparticles obtained by lt delafossite process on the basis of the well known ferrite process e g 29 37 and hydrothermal approaches to synthesize delafossite e g 39 the lt delafossite process was developed in 2016 to synthesize cufeo2 13 14 and to purify cu rich aqueous solutions and real industrial wastewater from electroplating industry at the same time 15 the delafossite process was used to purify wastewater from ni fe cr zn and sn however the delafossite process was not used to treat noble metal containing solutions up to now 3 2 5 1 ag wastewater with low concentration ag2 in fig 6 the x ray diffraction patterns of the fresh and 24 h aged residues obtained after the treatment of wastewater ag2 by lt delafossite process are presented both samples show strong reflections of ag0 sg 225 fm 3m additionally very broad peaks with low intensity assigned to ferrite sg 227 fd 3m are observable the high intensity of ag0 reflections and the low intensity of the ferrite peaks may be attributed to a shell of ag0 around nano crystalline ferrite particles a similar effect is postulated by gong and coworkers 16 the reflection intensities assigned to ferrite are in the fresh sample higher compared to the 24 h aged sample indicating an increased crystallinity of ag with ageing time ftir analyses show no characteristic absorbance bands of gr a typical precursor phase of ferrite or delafossite 12 14 15 or any fe hydroxides fig 7 but strong bands at 429 563 and 623 cm 1 and a very weak one at 705 cm 1 the absorbance band at 563 cm 1 is attributed to ag ferrite the incorporation of ag in the magnetite structure is assumed to shift the typical position of magnetite at 580 cm 1 to the lower value the two bands positioned around 620 and 430 cm 1 can be assigned to agfeo2 17 in comparison to the fresh residue the intensity of these bands decreases for the 24 h aged sample see enlarged section in fig 7 the bulk chemical composition of the precipitated phases was analyzed by aas for both fresh and aged sample the mole ratio of ag fe is almost 1 1 additionally eds measurements on various randomly selected points were performed in general two types of composite particles can be distinguished in the samples fe rich particles type abc containing 0 8 ag and 25 47 fe and ag rich particles type def containing 25 40 ag and 16 25 fe in the tem image in fig 8 the abc particles appear lighter and the def particles darker fig 8a shows additionally the diffraction pattern of the area marked in green the bright rings can be assigned to ferrite and ag0 additionally very weak reflections related to agfeo2 can be observed it was not possible to take individual electron diffraction patterns of the single phases it is probably caused by the overlapping of the 2 20 nm small particles or partially inter grown nano spheres the hr tem images in fig 8 with d spacings of particle type abc however indicate the formation of fe3o4 our results show that it is not possible to precipitate single phased agfeo2 with delafossite structure at 70 c by the lt delafossite process using sulfate salts as reactants this is probably the effect of divalent fe2 which easily reduces ag the reduction of ag to its zero valent state by gr was already observed during the ferritization process this study 3 2 1 and described 2003 by óloughlin et al 38 3 2 5 2 ag wastewater with low concentrations using nitrates as reactants ag3 due to the observed strong reducing potential of fe2 in sulfate solutions we investigated additional experiments using nitrates as reactants with the aim to synthesize agfeo2 with delafossite structure it is aligned to the hydrothermal route presented by xiong and coworkers to synthesize agalo2 by using al no3 3 and agno3 as reactants 40 they describe the reaction of ag2o with alooh to form agalo2 under alkaline conditions murthy and co authors synthesized agfeo2 in 2011 by precipitation reaction from nitrate containing solution at ph 11 12 with a high temperature after treatment between 400 and 900 c 41 fig 9 shows the x ray diffraction pattern of the fresh precipitates obtained from ag3 the synthesized material contains both polytypes of agfeo2 3r delafossite and 2h delafossite ftir analysis expose exclusively absorption bands assigned to agfeo2 polytypes whereas characteristic bands of co precipitated fe hydroxides are not observable agfeo2 mainly crystallizes in hexagonal plates up to 50 nm size and most of the crystals show a very high amount of dislocations fig 10 a both bulk chemistry measurements by aas and numerous edx analysis fig 10b confirmed an atomic ratio ag fe of 1 1 in the sample in contrast to the delafossite process synthesizing cufeo2 13 15 and agfeo2 production using high temperature 400 c after treatment 41 herein agfeo2 is spontaneously formed with start of the precipitation reaction and ageing has no further effect 4 conclusion our two different treatment processes are feasible to recover ag and au from sulfate and nitrate containing wastewaters with initial metal concentrations from 0 3 g l up to 5 g l the precipitated phases are directly controllable by the reaction parameters as e g initial metal concentration temperature amount of added fe and alkalization conditions the procedures provide following benefits ag and au can be recovered to 99 99 from wastewater at optimized conditions ag and au can be precipitated as zero valent phases and can easily be removed from the solution after the fe2 addition step in a separate step during alkalization of the fe rich solution magnetite precipitates it is possible to synthesize various ag products as single phased delafossite agfeo2 or composite particles of ag0 together with delafossite or fe3o4 ag and au precipitate as zero valent metals or as valuable phases which can be used in industrial applications fast 20 min easy

14374,during mining minerals such as fes2 are exposed to o2 h2o and microorganisms resulting in the oxidation and generation of acidic water the acidic water causes chemical weathering of the adjacent rocks and leaching of potentially toxic metals and the resultant water is often termed acid mine drainage amd coal power stations produce an alkaline aluminosilicate waste material called fly ash cfa modern waste resource management emphasises finding useful applications of waste generated from processes to achieve a green economy cfa was with additional lime and al oh 3 used to treat amd at a 80l pilot scale most of the physical and chemical parameters of the treated water were within south african target water quality range twqr for irrigation carbonation of the water after treatment with cfa lime and al oh 3 produced water that was within the twqr for irrigation with respect to all parameters and resulted in the sequestration of 15 123l of co2 per 80 l of amd treated at standard ambient temperature and pressure co2 reacted with ca ions in the water and solid residues to form caco3 carbonation improves the ease of disposal of cfa the amd quality as well as reducing the amount of co2 emissions by coal power plants through mineral carbonation the solid residues from the overall process are suitable for the back filling of mine voids thereby preventing amd generation by excluding air and water this is an innovative cradle to cradle solution for the disposal of waste materials from coal mines and power stations keywords in situ carbonation ex situ carbonation carbon dioxide sequestration back filling target water quality range 1 introduction mining industries create economic benefit and they continue to play an important role in south africa s economy however coal mining has a significant environmental impact of uncontrolled discharge of acidic water from both abandoned and operating mines acid mine drainage amd is produced by chemical weathering of acid minerals such as pyrite in the presence of o2 and h2o according to eq 1 1 2 f e s 2 7 o 2 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 2 h 4 s o 4 2 the sulphuric acid generated causes chemical weathering of the surrounding rocks leaching potentially toxic metals and radioactive elements into water 1 pyrite is a common constituent in many ore bodies associated with coal and gold mining 2 it is well known that 98 of south africa gold is produced from the witwatersrand formations which were formed from an ancient sea where rivers deposited their sediments as sands and gravels that became conglomerates containing gold and about 3 of pyrite after gold extraction the pyrite normally ends up in mine waste dumps however during the rainy seasons the pyrite in the dumps is oxidised and causes the formation of sulphuric acid which percolates through the dumps dissolving heavy metals 2 gold occurs in association with pyrite fes2 which accounts for about 3 of the au bearing minerals 3 exposing the ore body and country rock to o2 and h2o produces sulphuric acid and fe iii as shown in eq 1 the witwatersrand goldfields also have strata with neutralizing minerals such as dolomite ca mg co3 2 and caco3 these minerals not in sufficient proportions to neutralise the acidity caused by the oxidation of pyrite but result in amd with elevated concentration of ca and mg ions the acidic ph of the mine water discharging from mine voids makes it unsuitable for domestic agricultural and industrial use 4 5 the mine water is also unsuitable to be released into the environment and thus poses a liability to the mining company therefore it is essential to treat the mine water before it can be released to the environment various mine water treatment technologies can be broadly classified as passive active and or integrated treatment processes 6 13 the application of the technologies is limited because of one or more of the following challenge 12 6 7 9 i the generation of voluminous sludge that is expensive to dispose ii high running cost and iii poor efficiencies to reduce the above setbacks the research community have embarked on various initiatives to reduce the volume of sludge generated the running costs and thereby improving the efficiency kefeni et al 7 have proposed that such initiatives can be achieved through recovery of valuable resources such as metals 14 11 15 19 gypsum 11 19 elemental sulphur 9 clean water 19 and the use readily available materials such as bentonite and clay 12 and waste materials such coal fly ash 20 it is estimated that south africa produces 252 mt of coal and exports about 58 mt every year dmr 2009 the largest coal reserves are around witbank highveld ermelo and the waterberg however water rising from the coalfields is dominated by high concentrations of calcium magnesium and sulphate ions between 360 and 170 ml day of contaminated mine water might be generated after closure of the witbank coalfields and discharged into the olifants catchment 21 mine water in south africa and around the world requires accurate management to reduce negative impacts ways in which amd could be managed include pollution prevention at source and the reuse and recycling of polluted water treatment of effluents should be implemented if the problem cannot be solved through prevention reuse and recycling 22 many studies have been conducted on the utilisation of cfa to reduce disposal costs and replace expensive and scarce resources with cfa some of the proposed applications include using cfa as an additive in the manufacturing of cement and in road construction material as feedstock in zeolite synthesis and for neutralising and treating amd from coal mines 23 25 it has been shown that amd can be treated with cfa lime and al oh 3 to acheive good quality with most parameters within the twqr recommended by department of water and sanitation dws and world health organisation who for irrigation and potable water except for ph ec and the concentration of elements such as al3 and ca2 4 5 20 coal combustion emits nitrous oxide sulphurous oxide and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere these gases contribute to the greenhouse effect many nations have a clean air law that enforces the reduction of greenhouse gases ghg emission south africa generates about 93 of its electricity by burning coal and about 218 mt of co2 is released to the atmosphere

reactor after mixing the mixture settled for 30 min the resultant water was separated from the solid residue then returned to the jet loop reactor and the product water was sparged with co2 to acheive a ph between 6 and 9 samples were filtered with 0 45 μm filter paper then preserved at 4 c and analysed using ic and icp oes solid residues were analysed with xrf xrd and sem analysis in order to

bhvo 1 basalt from the united states geological survey reston 3 results and discussions mine water was neutralised with cfa lime and al oh 3 the neutralised water was carbonated in situ at ph 9 in situ carbonation 1 or at ph 11 in situ carbonation 2 or was separated from the solid residues before being carbonated at ph 11 ex situ carbonation the ph and ec results obtained are shown in fig 1 the ph of mine water was 2 12 this is not within the twqr for irrigation 6 5 8 4 or potable water 6 9 according to morin and hutt 31 the mine water was classified as amd due to the ph which is below 6 treatment of mine water with cfa lime and al oh 3 result in and increase in ph and a decrease in ec decreased as shown in fig 1 the ph of the mine water increased because of the dissolution of lime as described in eq 2 2 c a o h o 2 c a 2 o h the mine water had a high concentration of fe al mn mg and sulphate ions the changes in the concentration of fe al mn mg and sulphate ions during mixing of amd with cfa lime al oh 3 as well as during in situ or ex situ carbonation are shown in fig 2 the concentration of the pollutants such as al ca fe mg and so4 2 decreased during treatment with cfa lime and al oh 3 as shown in fig 2a and b the sulphate ions in the mine water decreased from 3485 mg l to 244 mg l this was due to the formation of gypsum and etringite eqs 3 and 4 the metal cations such as fe al and mn were removed as metal hydroxides as shown in eq 5 32 3 c a 2 s o 4 2 2 h o 2 c a s o 4 2 h o 2 4 6 c a 2 3 s o 4 2 2 a l o h 3 32 h o 2 c a 6 s 3 a l 4 o 21 32 h o 2 6 h 5 m n n h 2 o m o h n n h this resulted in the decrease in the ec of the treated water from 6 72 ms cm to 4 25 ms cm the treatment of mine water with cfa lime and al oh 3 resulted in water that is suitable for irrigation and domestic use except with respect to ph ec and the concentration of ca and al to adjust the ph co2 gas was added to the mixture of mine water cfa lime and al oh 3 in situ carbonation after 150 min when the ph was greater than 9 the co2 was added for 15 min and the mixture was allowed to react while maintain the ph to be between 6 and 9 the final ph of in situ carbonation was 7 72 to adjust the ph after mixing mine water cfa lime and al oh 3 and separating the water from the solid residue ex situ carbonation the co2 gas solution was added for 15 min and the ph dropped from 10 14 to 7 15 after 40 min carbonation in situ or ex situ resulted in water with a final ph of around 7 which was within the twqr for irrigation and potable water this was due to the formation of carbonic acid hco3 6 c o 2 h o 2 2 h c o 3 2 the ec of in situ carbonated water between 3 and 7 ms cm is not within the twqr for potable and irrigation 0 4 0 7 ms cm however ex situ carbonation produced product water with an ec of 0 14 ms cm which is within the twqr requirements this happens because when co2 is added in situ it causes the ph to decrease dissolving the ettringite in the solid residues according to le chatelier s principle increasing the concentration of sulphate the sulphate concentration increased from 264 mg l to about 470 570 mg l which is slightly above the twqr for potable water during ex situ carbonation of product water the sulphate concentration increased slightly from 264 mg l to 353 mg l this is still was below the twqr for potable water of 500 mg l the ec decreased from 4 45 ms cm to 0 14 ms cm this was because the concentration of elements such as ca and al ions were also reduced as shown in fig 2a also there was no dissolution of ettringite because the solid residues were separated prior to carbonation the acidity generated during the oxidation of fes2 caused leaching of potentially toxic elements into the water such as b cr pb th ba hg as and se in addition to ca mg na cl al and mn the concentration of these elements in the treated mine water were above the twqr for both irrigation and potable water as shown in table 3 dwaf 1996 who 2011 in situ carbonating of the treated gold mine water showed that most minor and trace elements complied with the twqr except for ce hg cr and mo hg is a very toxic element which was found in the product water after in situ carbonating the gold mine water in situ carbonation of the gold mine water caused the ph of the mixture to decrease thereby causing leaching of hg from the solid residue due to decrease in ph when carbonating the ex situ product water only the concentration of trace and minor elements such as ni sr cr and mo was not decreased to within twqr as shown in table 1 but these concentrations were very close to twqr standards therefore ex situ carbonation of the product water was the best option because the ec and sulphate of the solution achieved the tqwr for both irrigation and potable water this method produces a water of potable or irrigation quality without the use of reverse osmosis 3 1 mineralogy of in situ carbonated solid residue during treatment of gold mine water with cfa lime and al oh 3 as well as during the in situ carbonation samples of solid residues were collected this was done to measure the changes in the elemental and mineral composition the mineralogy at various stages of treatment was established using quantitative xrd and the results are shown in fig 3 the xrd results showed that cfa was made of an amorphous glassy silicate material 60 quartz 13 mullite 25 hematite 1 and lime 1 the solid residue before carbonation was mainly composed of gypsum 5 and ettringite 4 in addition to the amorphous material quartz and mullite that were in fly ash the formation of gypsum and ettringite correlated well with the removal of so4 2 and al as shown in fig 2 the amorphous material in the solid residues increased to 61 because of the formation of the amorphous hydroxides of metal ions from mine water in situ carbonation of the solid residues resulted in the formation of 3 calcite caco3 as shown in fig 3 this was because of the reaction of co3 2 produced in eq 7 with ca2 in the mine water and the solid residues 7 c a 2 c o 3 2 c a c o 3 the solid residues containing mineral sequestered co2 in the form of calcite could be used to backfill mine voids 3 1 1 elementary composition of in situ carbonated solid residues the elementary composition of fresh cfa was compared with solid residue after treating amd with cfa lime al oh 3 and after in situ carbonation of the mixture the results obtained are shown in table 4 during treatment of amd with cfa lime and al oh 3 the so3 content in the solid residues increased from 0 59 to 3 25 this was because of the formation of ettringite and gypsum after in situ carbonation the so3 content in the solid residues decreased this is attributed to the dissolution of ettringite at lower ph the ettringite reaction is a dynamic equilibrium reaction decreasing the ph that is increasing the concentration of h of the mixture favoured the dissociation of ettringite according to le chatelier s principle also the content of fe and mn increased in the solid residues this is balanced but the decrease in the concentration of sulphate ions from amd during mixing with cfa 3 1 2 morphology of in situ carbonated solid residue during treatment of mine water with coal fa lime and al oh 3 as well during in situ carbonation solid residue samples were collected and analysed using sem the morphological changes that occurred at different stages of treatment are shown in fig 4 the sem images showed that the morphology of cfa changed during treatment of mine water cfa was made up of smooth spherical particles during treatment of mine water the cfa spheres developed needle like particles on the surface this could be attributed to the formation of gypsum and ettringite white flakes were observed on the surfaces of in situ carbonation solid residue surfaces this could be attributed to the formation of caco3 from the reaction of ca ions with co2 these results correlated were supported by the mineralogical results obtained from quantitative xrd of the solid residues 4 carbonation capture capacity carbon capture capacity ccc was calculated based on the results from the quantitative xrd for the in situ carbonation the ccc was determined by comparing the final concentration of alkaline and alkaline earth metal ions before and after carbonation during in situ carbonation the solid residue residues contained 3 of caco3 the solid residues recovered were not less than the initial mass of cfa lime and al oh 3 added which was 16544 45 g this means that at least 496 33 g of caco3 was captured during the carbonation of the mixture of amd coal fa lime and al oh 3 c o 2 i n c a c o 3 molecular mass c o 2 molecular mass c a c o 3 12 2 16 12 3

r e a t e d during ex situ carbonation the concentration of alkali and alkaline earth metals such as ca k sr and ba was decreased using the stoichiometric equations for each element about 0 013 mol l of co2 was captured during ex situ carbonation as 45l of water was carbonated the volume of co2 captured at satp was v c o 2 e x s i t u n r t p 0 013 45 m o l 0 082057 l a t m k 1 m o l 1 298 k 0

9 or at 210 min this was because co2 was mainly reacting with ca2 in solution whereas in situ co2 was reacting with both alkali and alkali earth metals in the solution as well in cfa and lime 5 conclusions acid mine drainage represented by the water sample collected from the witwatersrand gold fields had a ph of 2 and very high concentration of so4 2 fe al mg ca and mn ions the presence of lime in the cfa makes it suitable to neutralize amd and precipitate potentially toxic elements such as fe al and mn cfa contained mullite quartz hematite and lime embedded in an amorphous glassy matrix the presence of ca and mg in both amd and cfa makes these suitable to capture co2 in the form carbonate minerals it was found that during mixing of amd with cfa lime and al oh 3 most pollutants were removed and a twqr for irrigation and potable water was acheived the ph ec and the concentration of ca al sr mo and cr exceeded the twqr for irrigation upon carbonation the ph and the concentration of ca and al was reduced to meet twqr for irrigation the ec of ex situ carbonation met the twqr for irrigation but in situ carbonated water did not this was because in situ carbonation remobilises the pollutants that have been precipitated co precipitated or adsorbed ettringite is very sensitive to changes in ph during carbonation the ph decreased to within twqr for potable and irrigation standards due to the formation of h2co3 the co3 2 in turn reacted with ca2 to form calcite in situ carbonation captured more co2 than ex situ carbonation this is because during ex situ carbonation the co2 reacts with ca2 in the solution while during in situ carbonation co2 was reacted with ca2 in solution as well as ca remaining in fa or lime added the solid residues containing mineral sequestered co2 in the form of calcite could be used to backfill mine voids this can reduce the additional formation of acid mine drainage by excluding air and water this study was performed to improve the quality of water following the mixing mine water with cfa chemical lime and al oh 3 so that the water could meet twqr standards for irrigation and potable water as cfa is inexpensive to obtain this method could provide a less costly alternate to the treatment of amd with lime or limestone treating mine water using the jet loop reactor is cheaper because cfa is readily available and inexpensive waste material the study showed that the use of cfa could reduce the sulphate concentration to less than a 1000 mg l within 210 min this implies that the cfa process can replace lime the resultant water is of high quality and the solid residues are suitable for use in mine backfilling filling the mine voids may also reduce the generation of amd treatment of mine water using this technology would also reduce the amount of co2 emissions in the atmosphere and the disposal problems associated with fa acknowledgements the authors would like to thank claude leon foundation the

14374,during mining minerals such as fes2 are exposed to o2 h2o and microorganisms resulting in the oxidation and generation of acidic water the acidic water causes chemical weathering of the adjacent rocks and leaching of potentially toxic metals and the resultant water is often termed acid mine drainage amd coal power stations produce an alkaline aluminosilicate waste material called fly ash cfa modern waste resource management emphasises finding useful applications of waste generated from processes to achieve a green economy cfa was with additional lime and al oh 3 used to treat amd at a 80l pilot scale most of the physical and chemical parameters of the treated water were within south african target water quality range twqr for irrigation carbonation of the water after treatment with cfa lime and al oh 3 produced water that was within the twqr for irrigation with respect to all parameters and resulted in the sequestration of 15 123l of co2 per 80 l of amd treated at standard ambient temperature and pressure co2 reacted with ca ions in the water and solid residues to form caco3 carbonation improves the ease of disposal of cfa the amd quality as well as reducing the amount of co2 emissions by coal power plants through mineral carbonation the solid residues from the overall process are suitable for the back filling of mine voids thereby preventing amd generation by excluding air and water this is an innovative cradle to cradle solution for the disposal of waste materials from coal mines and power stations keywords in situ carbonation ex situ carbonation carbon dioxide sequestration back filling target water quality range 1 introduction mining industries create economic benefit and they continue to play an important role in south africa s economy however coal mining has a significant environmental impact of uncontrolled discharge of acidic water from both abandoned and operating mines acid mine drainage amd is produced by chemical weathering of acid minerals such as pyrite in the presence of o2 and h2o according to eq 1 1 2 f e s 2 7 o 2 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 2 h 4 s o 4 2 the sulphuric acid generated causes chemical weathering of the surrounding rocks leaching potentially toxic metals and radioactive elements into water 1 pyrite is a common constituent in many ore bodies associated with coal and gold mining 2 it is well known that 98 of south africa gold is produced from the witwatersrand formations which were formed from an ancient sea where rivers deposited their sediments as sands and gravels that became conglomerates containing gold and about 3 of pyrite after gold extraction the pyrite normally ends up in mine waste dumps however during the rainy seasons the pyrite in the dumps is oxidised and causes the formation of sulphuric acid which percolates through the dumps dissolving heavy metals 2 gold occurs in association with pyrite fes2 which accounts for about 3 of the au bearing minerals 3 exposing the ore body and country rock to o2 and h2o produces sulphuric acid and fe iii as shown in eq 1 the witwatersrand goldfields also have strata with neutralizing minerals such as dolomite ca mg co3 2 and caco3 these minerals not in sufficient proportions to neutralise the acidity caused by the oxidation of pyrite but result in amd with elevated concentration of ca and mg ions the acidic ph of the mine water discharging from mine voids makes it unsuitable for domestic agricultural and industrial use 4 5 the mine water is also unsuitable to be released into the environment and thus poses a liability to the mining company therefore it is essential to treat the mine water before it can be released to the environment various mine water treatment technologies can be broadly classified as passive active and or integrated treatment processes 6 13 the application of the technologies is limited because of one or more of the following challenge 12 6 7 9 i the generation of voluminous sludge that is expensive to dispose ii high running cost and iii poor efficiencies to reduce the above setbacks the research community have embarked on various initiatives to reduce the volume of sludge generated the running costs and thereby improving the efficiency kefeni et al 7 have proposed that such initiatives can be achieved through recovery of valuable resources such as metals 14 11 15 19 gypsum 11 19 elemental sulphur 9 clean water 19 and the use readily available materials such as bentonite and clay 12 and waste materials such coal fly ash 20 it is estimated that south africa produces 252 mt of coal and exports about 58 mt every year dmr 2009 the largest coal reserves are around witbank highveld ermelo and the waterberg however water rising from the coalfields is dominated by high concentrations of calcium magnesium and sulphate ions between 360 and 170 ml day of contaminated mine water might be generated after closure of the witbank coalfields and discharged into the olifants catchment 21 mine water in south africa and around the world requires accurate management to reduce negative impacts ways in which amd could be managed include pollution prevention at source and the reuse and recycling of polluted water treatment of effluents should be implemented if the problem cannot be solved through prevention reuse and recycling 22 many studies have been conducted on the utilisation of cfa to reduce disposal costs and replace expensive and scarce resources with cfa some of the proposed applications include using cfa as an additive in the manufacturing of cement and in road construction material as feedstock in zeolite synthesis and for neutralising and treating amd from coal mines 23 25 it has been shown that amd can be treated with cfa lime and al oh 3 to acheive good quality with most parameters within the twqr recommended by department of water and sanitation dws and world health organisation who for irrigation and potable water except for ph ec and the concentration of elements such as al3 and ca2 4 5 20 coal combustion emits nitrous oxide sulphurous oxide and carbon dioxide into the atmosphere these gases contribute to the greenhouse effect many nations have a clean air law that enforces the reduction of greenhouse gases ghg emission south africa generates about 93 of its electricity by burning coal and about 218 mt of co2 is released to the atmosphere

anion certified standard was used to check the efficiency of the ic machine the seven anion was made up of known concentration of f cl no2 br no3 po4 3 and so4 2 the seven standard anions were run together with the sample in order to check the accuracy of the results obtained ii the icp oes instrument was calibrated before analysis using spectra scan standards obtained from industrial analytical services pty ltd the icp oes instrument was calibrated with a standard solution spectra scan with multiple elements 1000 ppm for trace and major elements in order to obtain the intensities at specific wavelength for each element and from icp expert ii software calibration a curve of intensities versus concentration was obtained auto integration using icp expert ii software was performed and each sample was run for 8 min for each treatment iii xrf control standards that were used in the calibration procedures were nim g granite from the council for mineral technology south africa and bhvo 1 basalt from the united states geological survey reston 3 results and discussions mine water was neutralised with cfa lime and al oh 3 the neutralised water was carbonated in situ at ph 9 in situ carbonation 1 or at ph 11 in situ carbonation 2 or was separated from the solid residues before being carbonated at ph 11 ex situ carbonation the ph and ec results obtained are shown in fig 1 the ph of mine water was 2 12 this is not within the twqr for irrigation 6 5 8 4 or potable water 6 9 according to morin and hutt 31 the mine water was classified as amd due to the ph which is below 6 treatment of mine water with cfa lime and al oh 3 result in and increase in ph and a decrease in ec decreased as shown in fig 1 the ph of the mine water increased because of the dissolution of lime as described in eq 2 2 c a o h o 2 c a 2 o h the mine water had a high concentration of fe al mn mg and sulphate ions the changes in the concentration of fe al mn mg and sulphate ions during mixing of amd with cfa lime al oh 3 as well as during in situ or ex situ carbonation are shown in fig 2 the concentration of the pollutants such as al ca fe mg and so4 2 decreased during treatment with cfa lime and al oh 3 as shown in fig 2a and b the sulphate ions in the mine water decreased from 3485 mg l to 244 mg l this was due to the formation of gypsum and etringite eqs 3 and 4 the metal cations such as fe al and mn were removed as metal hydroxides as shown in eq 5 32 3 c a 2 s o 4 2 2 h o 2 c a s o 4 2 h o 2 4 6 c a 2 3 s o 4 2 2 a l o h 3 32 h o 2 c a 6 s 3 a l 4 o 21 32 h o 2 6 h 5 m n n h 2 o m o h n n h this resulted in the decrease in the ec of the treated water from 6 72 ms cm to 4 25 ms cm the treatment of mine water with cfa lime and al oh 3 resulted in water that is suitable for irrigation and domestic use except with respect to ph ec and the concentration of ca and al to adjust the ph co2 gas was added to the mixture of mine water cfa lime and al oh 3 in situ carbonation after 150 min when the ph was greater than 9 the co2 was added for 15 min and the mixture was allowed to react while maintain the ph to be between 6 and 9 the final ph of in situ carbonation was 7 72 to adjust the ph after mixing mine water cfa lime and al oh 3 and separating the water from the solid residue ex situ carbonation the co2 gas solution was added for 15 min and the ph dropped from 10 14 to 7 15 after 40 min carbonation in situ or ex situ resulted in water with a final ph of around 7 which was within the twqr for irrigation and potable water this was due to the formation of carbonic acid hco3 6 c o 2 h o 2 2 h c o 3 2 the ec of in situ carbonated water between 3 and 7 ms cm is not within the twqr for potable and irrigation 0 4 0 7 ms cm however ex situ carbonation produced product water with an ec of 0 14 ms cm which is within the twqr requirements this happens because when co2 is added in situ it causes the ph to decrease dissolving the ettringite in the solid residues according to le chatelier s principle increasing the concentration of sulphate the sulphate concentration increased from 264 mg l to about 470 570 mg l which is slightly above the twqr for potable water during ex situ carbonation of product water the sulphate concentration increased slightly from 264 mg l to 353 mg l this is still was below the twqr for potable water of 500 mg l the ec decreased from 4 45 ms cm to 0 14 ms cm this was because the concentration of elements such as ca and al ions were also reduced as shown in fig 2a also there was no dissolution of ettringite because the solid residues were separated prior to carbonation the acidity generated during the oxidation of fes2 caused leaching of potentially toxic elements into the water such as b cr pb th ba hg as and se in addition to ca mg na cl al and mn the concentration of these elements in the treated mine water were above the twqr for both irrigation and potable water as shown in table 3 dwaf 1996 who 2011 in situ carbonating of the treated gold mine water showed that most minor and trace elements complied with the twqr except for ce hg cr and mo hg is a very toxic element which was found in the product water after in situ carbonating the gold mine water in situ carbonation of the gold mine water caused the ph of the mixture to decrease thereby causing leaching of hg from the solid residue due to decrease in ph when carbonating the ex situ product water only the concentration of trace and minor elements such as ni sr cr and mo was not decreased to within twqr as shown in table 1 but these concentrations were very close to twqr standards therefore ex situ carbonation of the product water was the best option because the ec and sulphate of the solution achieved the tqwr for both irrigation and potable water this method produces a water of potable or irrigation quality without the use of reverse osmosis 3 1 mineralogy of in situ carbonated solid residue during treatment of gold mine water with cfa lime and al oh 3 as well as during the in situ carbonation samples of solid residues were collected this was done to measure the changes in the elemental and mineral composition the mineralogy at various stages of treatment was established using quantitative xrd and the results are shown in fig 3 the xrd results showed that cfa was made of an amorphous glassy silicate material 60 quartz 13 mullite 25 hematite 1 and lime 1 the solid residue before carbonation was mainly composed of gypsum 5 and ettringite 4 in addition to the amorphous material quartz and mullite that were in fly ash the formation of gypsum and ettringite correlated well with the removal of so4 2 and al as shown in fig 2 the amorphous material in the solid residues increased to 61 because of the formation of the amorphous hydroxides of metal ions from mine water in situ carbonation of the solid residues resulted in the formation of 3 calcite caco3 as shown in fig 3 this was because of the reaction of co3 2 produced in eq 7 with ca2 in the mine water and the solid residues 7 c a 2 c o 3 2 c a c o 3 the solid residues containing mineral sequestered co2 in the form of calcite could be used to backfill mine voids 3 1 1 elementary composition of in situ carbonated solid residues the elementary composition of fresh cfa was compared with solid residue after treating amd with cfa lime al oh 3 and after in situ carbonation of the mixture the results obtained are shown in table 4 during treatment of amd with cfa lime and al oh 3 the so3 content in the solid residues increased from 0 59 to 3 25 this was because of the formation of ettringite and gypsum after in situ carbonation the so3 content in the solid residues decreased this is attributed to the dissolution of ettringite at lower ph the ettringite reaction is a dynamic equilibrium reaction decreasing the ph that is increasing the concentration of h of the mixture favoured the dissociation of ettringite according to le chatelier s principle also the content of fe and mn increased in the solid residues this is balanced but the decrease in the concentration of sulphate ions from amd during mixing with cfa 3 1 2 morphology of in situ carbonated solid residue during treatment of mine water with coal fa lime and al oh 3 as well during in situ carbonation solid residue samples were collected and analysed using sem the morphological changes that occurred at different stages of treatment are shown in fig 4 the sem images showed that the morphology of cfa changed during treatment of mine water cfa was made up of smooth spherical particles during treatment of mine water the cfa spheres developed needle like particles on the surface this could be attributed to the formation of gypsum and ettringite white flakes were observed on the surfaces of in situ carbonation solid residue surfaces this could be attributed to the formation of caco3 from the reaction of ca ions with co2 these results correlated were supported by the mineralogical results obtained from quantitative xrd of the solid residues 4 carbonation capture capacity carbon capture capacity ccc was calculated based on the results from the quantitative xrd for the in situ carbonation the ccc was determined by comparing the final concentration of alkaline and alkaline earth metal ions before and after carbonation during in situ carbonation the solid residue residues contained 3 of caco3 the solid residues recovered were not less than the initial mass of cfa lime and al oh 3 added which was 16544 45 g this means that at least 496 33 g of caco3 was captured during the carbonation of the mixture of amd coal fa lime and al oh 3 c o 2 i n c a c o 3 molecular mass c o 2 molecular mass c a c o 3 12 2 16 12 3

r e a t e d during ex situ carbonation the concentration of alkali and alkaline earth metals such as ca k sr and ba was decreased using the stoichiometric equations for each element about 0 013 mol l of co2 was captured during ex situ carbonation as 45l of water was carbonated the volume of co2 captured at satp was v c o 2 e x s i t u n r t p 0 013 45 m o l 0 082057 l a t m k 1 m o l 1 298 k 0

9 or at 210 min this was because co2 was mainly reacting with ca2 in solution whereas in situ co2 was reacting with both alkali and alkali earth metals in the solution as well in cfa and lime 5 conclusions acid mine drainage represented by the water sample collected from the witwatersrand gold fields had a ph of 2 and very high concentration of so4 2 fe al mg ca and mn ions the presence of lime in the cfa makes it suitable to neutralize amd and precipitate potentially toxic elements such as fe al and mn cfa contained mullite quartz hematite and lime embedded in an amorphous glassy matrix the presence of ca and mg in both amd and cfa makes these suitable to capture co2 in the form carbonate minerals it was found that during mixing of amd with cfa lime and al oh 3 most pollutants were removed and a twqr for irrigation and potable water was acheived the ph ec and the concentration of ca al sr mo and cr exceeded the twqr for irrigation upon carbonation the ph and the concentration of ca and al was reduced to meet twqr for irrigation the ec of ex situ carbonation met the twqr for irrigation but in situ carbonated water did not this was because in situ carbonation remobilises the pollutants that have been precipitated co precipitated or adsorbed ettringite is very sensitive to changes in ph during carbonation the ph decreased to within twqr for potable and irrigation standards due to the formation of h2co3 the co3 2 in turn reacted with ca2 to form calcite in situ carbonation captured more co2 than ex situ carbonation this is because during ex situ carbonation the co2 reacts with ca2 in the solution while during in situ carbonation co2 was reacted with ca2 in solution as well as ca remaining in fa or lime added the solid residues containing mineral sequestered co2 in the form of calcite could be used to backfill mine voids this can reduce the additional formation of acid mine drainage by excluding air and water this study was performed to improve the quality of water following the mixing mine water with cfa chemical lime and al oh 3 so that the water could meet twqr standards for irrigation and potable water as cfa is inexpensive to obtain this method could provide a less costly alternate to the treatment of amd with lime or limestone treating mine water using the jet loop reactor is cheaper because cfa is readily available and inexpensive waste material the study showed that the use of cfa could reduce the sulphate concentration to less than a 1000 mg l within 210 min this implies that the cfa process can replace lime the resultant water is of high quality and the solid residues are suitable for use in mine backfilling filling the mine voids may also reduce the generation of amd treatment of mine water using this technology would also reduce the amount of co2 emissions in the atmosphere and the disposal problems associated with fa acknowledgements the authors would like to thank claude leon foundation the
