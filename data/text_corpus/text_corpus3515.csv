17575,the red color is the most striking character of anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anaob which has been used to estimate the anammox activity roughly however the quantitative relationship between the color and activity of anammox sludge still remains unknown in this study the chromaticity activity and their correlation were systematically investigated at different steady state nitrogen loading rates the chromaticity of anammox sludge was digitalized by the cie l a b color space the results revealed that the average chroma value was found to be significantly correlated with specific anammox activity r 0 940 p 0 01 and the cluster centers of chromaticity coordinates a b of anammox sludge were established to define the typical working states of anammox system the visible spectra of anammox sludge were proved to originate from the cytochrome c the correlation between chroma and heme c concentration of anammox sludge was consistent with the fully reduced cytochrome c and the chroma was determined by both content and redox ratio of cytochrome c the chromaticity of anammox sludge was able to be linked with the anammox activity via reduced cytochrome c content the gene abundance of cytochrome c synthetase linked the chromaticity with anaob quantity via total cytochrome c content while the enzyme activity of octaheme hydrazine dehydrogenase linked the chromaticity with anaob activity via reduced cytochrome c ratio moreover the redundancy analysis proved that heme c as the key component of cytochrome c was the most important explanatory variable accounting for the maximum 69 6 of the total variation of the anammox community which correlated positively with the relative abundance of dominant anaob candidatus kuenenia this work aimed at demonstrating the chromaticity of anammox sludge could be developed as an alternative intuitive anammox activity indicator which will promote the monitoring and optimization of anammox process graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox sludge chromaticity parameters cytochrome c metabolic activity microbial community 1 introduction anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox is a promising biological nitrogen removal process mediated by autotrophic anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anaob which are capable of converting ammonium and nitrite to dinitrogen gas kuenen 2008 kartal et al 2010 because of its high nitrogen removal efficiency no requirement for exogenous organics and aeration less surplus sludge production van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 zhang et al 2019 anammox process has shown a broad application prospect in the wastewater treatment so far more than 200 full scale anammox facilities have been put into operation all over the world cao et al 2017 however the full scale application of anammox process still faces a great challenge due to the high sensitivity to environmental conditions the slow growing anammox consortia are vulnerable to the disturbance from misoperation even leading to the process breakdown therefore it is necessary to develop the real time process monitoring methods benefitting for the stability and robustness of anammox process while according to a current survey of full scale partial nitritation anammox plants they use a series of parameters among which ph and do concentration are the commonest on line monitoring indicators lackner et al 2014 although these parameters can reflect the physicochemical states of anammox process that affect the anammox rate they cannot indicate the physiological states of anaob that directly determine the anammox rate the molecular biology methods can be used to detect the quantity and activity of anaob but they need advanced instruments and complicated skills therefore it is necessary to develop a simple direct biological function related indicator for the monitoring and control of anammox process in an anammox system the functional bacteria form the sludge by self selection assembly and immobilization the microbial aggregates hold a unique microbial community with a specific spatial arrangement not only determining the anammox activity but also endowing the physical sludge a specific appearance which can serve as an auxiliary indicator to identify the metabolic activity d√≠az et al 2006 reported that the methanogenic granules took on black gray or brown color when they harbored different microbial communities with specific spatial structures which could indicate the physiological states of methanogenic microorganisms winkler et al 2011 observed that both red and white granules occurred in an anammox system harboring different dominant bacteria costa et al 2009 demonstrated that the morphological parameters especially filament length per aggregate area were an effective and timely indicator of high rate anaerobic systems color can be seen directly by human eyes and can also be perceived easily by the visual system in fact color has served as a biological index in many fields the ocean color spectra were associated with phytoplankton concentration to monitor fisheries and oceanic ecosystems mueller 1973 the color value a b of tomatoes was correlated with the lycopene content to indicate the tomato maturity arias et al 2000 the wine color was linked with the anthocyanins content to evaluate the quality of red wine han et al 2008 li et al 2019 investigated the synchronous response from the coefficient of variation cvh s of activated sludge color under different mixing conditions they proved that cvh s could reflect the change of operation parameters and it also held a similar trend with the respiration rate xu et al 2020b proposed that the color change of sludge during anaerobic digestion could indicate the anaerobic biochemical reactions of sludge organic matter the nondestructive quantification of color by the colorimeter makes the color as a viable option to monitor the anammox system it has been reported that the unique red color is one of the most striking physical properties of anammox sludge and can be roughly regarded as a mark of anammox activity imajo et al 2004 third et al 2005 tan et al 2020 however the quantitative relationships between the color value metabolic activity and microbial community of anammox sludge have not been established and the biological mechanism linking the color value to the physiological function of anaob has not been revealed either to understand the indicative function of sludge color and its mechanism the chromaticity of anammox sludge was systematically investigated within different anammox systems at the respective steady working states in this study the main work included 1 to characterize the chromaticity of anammox sludge at different nitrogen loads 2 to determine the visible spectra of anammox sludge and establish the correlation between chromaticity and cytochrome c 3 to link the cytochrome c with the quantity and activity of anaob 4 to analyze the correlation between chromaticity and microbial community the objective of this study was to investigate the correlation between chromaticity and activity of anammox sludge and reveal their linking mechanism which can promote the monitoring and control of anammox process with chromaticity as an intuitive biological index 2 materials and methods 2 1 anammox sludge the anammox sludge designated s0

ferousi et al 2013 the gene abundance of cytochrome c synthetase ccs could represent the total cytochrome c content which has also been developed to quantify the anaob zhou et al 2017 hydrazine oxidoreductase play a key role in anammox metabolic pathway and the hzo gene abundance could represent the enzyme quantity 0 25 g wet anammox sludge were used to extract the genomic dna following the

ggactachvgggtwtctaat muyzer et al 1993 the raw data sequenced by illumina miseq pe300 platform majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china was submitted to ncbi national center for biotechnology information under the accession number of srp159318 the data were further analyzed online by the platform of majorbio i sanger cloud platform www i sanger com 2 9 statistical analysis the chromaticity data were statistically analyzed by the software spss 20 0 box plots were applied to eliminate the outliers of data and the nonparametric tests independent samples kruskal wallis test are used for multi group difference test the k means cluster center initialization algorithm was conducted to cluster the chromaticity coordinates of anammox sludge and the average value was provided as the initial cluster center redundancy analysis rda was performed to analyze the correlation between chromaticity and microbial community using the multivariate data analysis software canoco 5 0 one way anova was applied to characterize the differences between two groups p 0 05 represents the significant differences and p 0 01 represents the extremely significant differences 3 results 3 1 chromaticity of anammox sludge at different nitrogen loads as shown in fig 1a the anammox sludge from different steady state reactors at their respective nitrogen loading rates nlrs took on different colors to characterize the sludge color quantitatively the cie l a b color space was applied and the chromaticity parameters of anammox sludge were obtained the results showed that the average chroma of anammox sludge had significant differences p 0 01 nonparametric kruskal wallis tests among the reactors the average value of chroma of s0 to s3 increased from 4 99 2 71 to 19 01 2 70 but the counterpart of s4 dropped to 15 69 1 46 fig 1b the exceptional decline of s4 was ascribed to the inhibition of high substrate concentration the chromaticity diagram displayed the distribution of sludge chromaticity points a b in a two dimensional coordinate system the k means clustering algorithm was applied to cluster the chromaticity coordinates of anammox sludge and five cluster centers were obtained for each working state as s0 1 97 3 96 s1 4 24 9 40 s2 7 49 14 52 s3 12 95 16 20 s4 9 38 12 29 fig 1c the euclidean distance between the cluster centers was shown in table s1 the average clustering accuracy could reach 71 7 table 1 by pearson correlation analysis chroma had a significant correlation with specific anammox activity saa of sludge r 0 940 p 0 01 which could be fitted into the linear equation as y 188 21x 28 10 r2 0 866 fig 1d therefore the chromaticity coordinates of anammox sludge could be applied to indicate the steady working states of anammox system 3 2 visible spectra of anammox sludge the color of object results from the way it reflects the particular wavelength of the light that falls on it to reveal the chromogenic mechanism of anammox sludge the visible spectra of crude enzyme were determined cytochrome c is proposed to be the key chromogenic substance of anaob kartal and keltjens 2016 the spectrum of cytochrome c differs in its two redox states spinazzi et al 2012 as seen from fig 2 a the reduced cytochrome c displayed three specific absorption bands which were 549 nm 520 nm 412 nm while the oxidized cytochrome c displayed two specific absorption bands which were 528 nm and 409 nm compared with the standard cytochrome c solution the visible spectra of anammox sludge had nearly the same specific absorption bands as the oxidized cytochrome c fig 2b f in the traditional color wheel model the complementary color at 409 nm purple 380 420 nm represents yellow b value while the counterpart at 528 nm green 495 570 nm shows red color a value the maximum absorption intensity of anammox sludge at around 409 nm increased from 2 476 s0 to 4 491 s3 and then dropped to 3 717 s4 which was consistent with the color channel b variation r 0 956 p 0 007 the specific absorption band of s0 at 528 nm was not detected and the overall absorption intensity around 0 724 of s0 was higher than that of other sludge resulting in the weak reflection intensity and the dark color with both low a and b value the absorption intensity of s1 to s4 firstly went up from 0 347 to 0 629 and then declined to 0 604 which matched the trend of color channel a r 0 904 p 0 018 3 3 heme c content and its relevance to chroma the red color of anaob was deduced to be derived from the high content of cytochrome c revealed by genomes sequencing analysis which could account for more than 30 of the total proteins cirpus et al 2005 cytochrome c contains heme c which is capable of oxidation and reduction as its iron atom converts between the ferrous and ferric forms the cytochrome c content of anammox sludge could be estimated by directly determining the heme c content the results showed that the extracted heme c of anammox sludge was mainly in the oxidized state accounting for 97 1 3 0 p 0 05 which was consistent with the visible spectra the heme c content stayed at a low level 0 69 0 88 Œºmol g vss when the anammox sludge was at the nlr less than 0 72 kg n m3 d a large increase to 1 87 0 15 Œºmol g vss was observed when the nlr was elevated to 5 05 kg n m3 d the highest heme c content reached 2 14 0 21 Œºmol g vss of s3 and then fell back to 2 06 0 08 Œºmol g vss of s4 p 0 05 fig 3 a to investigate the correlation between sludge chromaticity and cytochrome c content a series of gradient concentrations of standard fully reduced cytochrome c solutions were prepared fig s1 and the chroma was shown to have a positive correlation with the heme c concentration fitting the linear equation y 0 616x 6 459 r2 0 990 fig 3b the overall chroma of anammox sludge well fitted the correlation equation of fully reduced standard cytochrome c solutions which proved that the reduced cytochrome c content determined the chromaticity of anammox sludge 3 4 ccs gene abundance of anaob the type ‚Ö± cytochrome c maturation pathway has been identified in anaob genomics ferousi et al 2013 in the pathway the transmembrane proteins ccsab transport the heme molecule into the anammoxosome and maintain it in a reduced state then combined with the apocytochrome c to form the functional reduced c type cytochrome frawley and kranz 2009 therefore the ccs gene abundance could represent the total cytochrome c amount at the gene level the results showed that the ccs gene abundance of s0 at the storage state was as low as 3 01 0 92 1010 copies g vss an obvious increase was observed with a slight elevation of nlr to 0 72 kg n m3 d with the further elevation of nlr the ccs gene abundance increased from 2 60 0 32 1011 to the maximum 4 90 0 59 1011 copies g vss of s3 and then dropped to 4 44 0 18 1011 copies g vss of s4 fig 4 a moreover the ccs gene abundance was proved to be able to characterize the anaob quantity zhou et al 2017 chroma correlated significantly with the ccs gene abundance r 0 947 p 0 01 fitting the equation y 2 65 10 11 x 5 03 r2 0 863 fig 4b therefore the chromaticity of anammox sludge could be linked to the anaob quantity via the total cytochrome c amount revealed by ccs gene abundance 3 5 hzo gene abundance and hydrazine dehydrogenase activity of anaob the hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh is the key enzyme of anammox pathway converting hydrazine to dinitrogen gas which is also the largest soluble multiheme c type cytochrome complex containing a 192 heme electron transfer network akram et al 2019 to figure out the correlation between cytochrome c and metabolic activity the hzo gene abundance and specific hdh activity were determined to characterize the metabolic activity of anaob the results showed that the hzo gene abundance of s0 at the storage state was as low as 8 47 7 73 1010 copies g vss the hzo gene abundance of s1 increased largely with a slight elevation of nlr to 0 72 kg n m3 d with the further elevation of nlr the hzo gene abundance increased from 1 06 0 07 1012 to 1 58 1 72 1012 copies g vss but no significant difference existed between s3 and s4 p 0 05 fig 5 a accordingly the specific hdh activity of s0 also had the lowest value of 24 43 4 12 Œºmol cyt c reduced g vss min with the elevation of nlr the specific hdh activity went up and reached the maximum 1105 65 144 49 Œºmol cyt c reduced g vss min of s3 and then dropped to 487 72 54 82 Œºmol cyt c reduced g vss min of s4 fig 5b moreover chroma correlated significantly with the specific hdh activity r 0 897 p 0 05 fitting the equation y 3 62ln x 6 80 r2 0 996 fig 5c the hdh activity represents the ability of reducing oxidized cytochrome c with the increase of enzyme activity the reduced cytochrome c ratio can also be enhanced which will cause the decline of chroma fig s3d and level off the correlation curve fig 5c therefore the chromaticity of anammox sludge could be linked to the anaob activity via the reduced cytochrome c ratio revealed by specific hdh activity 3 6 redundancy analysis rda of quantitative correlation between chromaticity and microbial community anammox sludge harbors a series of specific microorganisms which together determine the specific anammox activity the composition and succession of microbial community at different nlrs were determined by the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing the quantitative relationship between chromaticity and microbial community were further investigated by the constrained ordination technique and rda analysis the relative abundance of genera in the anammox sludge was listed in table 2 candidatus kuenenia and anaerolineaceae norank were the most dominant genera in all the anammox systems at different nlrs the former belonged to planctomycetes and was the dominant anaob surprisingly after a long term starvation the candidatus kuenenia of s0 still had the relative abundance of 0 199 which proved that anaob went through the dormancy with the number and activity at a low but constant level xu et al 2020a with the elevation of nlr the relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia increased from 0 100 to 0 443 and then dropped to 0 344 which was consistent with the anammox activity anaerolineaceae was a common family found in anaerobic sludge which was assumed to be the primary degraders of dissolved organic matter zhang et al 2018 decreasing from 0 244 to 0 133 the rda analysis as displayed in fig 6 revealed that the samples at different nlrs were able to be separated clearly indicating the obvious shift of microbial community the first and second canonical axes represented 74 6 and 16 7 of variation respectively s0 had the richest microbial diversity while candidatus kuenenia was absolutely dominant in s2 and s3 the heme c content has explained the maximum 69 6 of total variation in the microbial community p 0 03 the heme c content had a strong positive correlation with both chroma and saa the distribution of microbial community was clearly divided into two opposite directions the relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia chloroflexi denitratisoma and brocadiaceae unclassified contributed positively to the chroma while the occurrence of nitrospira ardenticatenia anaerolineaceae limnobacter thiobacillus sm1a02 and candidatus brocadia resulted in the decline of chroma 4 discussion 4 1 chromaticity coordinates divided the working states of anammox process in this study the chromaticity of anammox sludge at different nitrogen loadings was characterized quantitively to establish the chromaticity coordinates to define the typical working states of anammox system due to the color heterogeneity of anammox sludge the color of random single granular sludge was digitalized by the cie l a b color space which is a simple direct and precise color measuring method tkalcic and tasic 2003 based on the data driven analysis the overall chroma had a positive correlation with specific anammox activity fig 1d and according to the pattern of chromaticity coordinates a b the performance of anammox systems could be visually divided into several typical working states i e performance intervals each typical steady state had the specific cluster center of chromaticity coordinates table 1 and an instantaneous working state could be fit into the performance interval and you can tell its performance by observing and comparing the chromaticity of anammox sludge at steady states despite some bias caused by the internal color heterogeneity the overall accuracy still could reach 71 7 which could be further increased by optimizing the sample amount and clustering algorithm of chromaticity parameters of anammox sludge 4 2 cytochrome c linked the chromaticity with activity of anammox sludge color is a vital physical characteristic that arises from the selective absorption of visible light which can be seen directly by the human eyes what is the chromogenic substance of anammox sludge considering ferrous iron is heavily needed by anaob and is routinely added in the medium van de graaf et al 1996 ferousi et al 2017 it was speculated at first the red colored iron precipitate on the surface could be the chromogenic substance but the x ray powder diffraction xrd results showed no crystalline chemicals were detected on the surface of anammox sludge and no obvious differences were observed among different working states anaob has been assumed to be the chromogenic source which held a high content of cytochrome c type proteins endowing the red color kartal et al 2013 moreover the optical visible spectra of anammox sludge at different working states showed the specific absorption bands of anammox sludge was consistent with that of standard oxidized cytochrome c solution fig 2 and the main absorption bands corresponded to the color channels a and b value separately which supported that cytochrome c was the main chromogenic source cytochrome c is an important part involved in the electron transport chain and it has been well established that the iron containing heme is the basic chromogenic molecule of cytochrome c nelson et al 2008 due to the interchange of fe2 and fe3 at the center of porphyrin ring the cytochrome c cycles between the reduced and oxidized state which exhibits the different colors accompanying the spectrum change fig s3 therefore both the content and redox ratio of cytochrome c could affect the chromaticity of anammox sludge although the heme c extract of anammox sludge was in oxidized form which is probably due to the exposure to the air during the extraction the relationship between the sludge chroma and heme c concentration agrees well with the fully reduced cytochrome c fig 3b chroma is a combination value of color channels a and b when the chromaticity coordinate a b of anammox sludge was compared with that of standard fully reduced cytochrome c if all of them were in the fully reduced state the a should be correlated linearly with b fig s3b but it can be seen from fig 1c that with the increase of a the b tended to maintain stable in addition when the specific hdh activity increased more cytochrome c can be reduced which enhanced the reduced cytochrome c ratio leading to the decline of chroma and flattened the curve fig 5c therefore it can be deduced that with the increase of anammox activity both the content and redox ratio of cytochrome c determined the sludge chromaticity the anammox activity of sludge depend on both the quantity and activity of anaob cytochrome c synthetase is the key transmembrane protein of regulating the production of cytochrome c the higher the ccs gene abundance the more heme molecules are transferred into the anammoxosome and the more cytochromes c could be produced the ccs gene abundance has been designed to detect the anaob quantity and chroma was proved to be significantly correlated with the ccs gene abundance r 0 947 p 0 01 fig 4b therefore the ccs gene abundance linked the chromaticity of anammox sludge to anaob quantity via the total cytochrome c content hdh as one of the key enzymes of anammox metabolic pathway determines the anammox activity directly hdh contains a large cytochromes c electron transfer network the higher the enzyme activity the more cytochromes c are at the reduced state at the starvation state the substrate supply was insufficient to produce enough electron to maintain the reduced state resulting in the decrease of its proportion while at the poison state the enzyme was inhibited by the high substrate concentration causing the decrease of reduced form as well chroma was proved to be significantly correlated with the specific hdh activity r 0 897 p 0 05 fig 5c therefore the specific hdh activity linked the chromaticity of anammox sludge to anaob activity via the reduced cytochrome c ratio taken together the chromaticity of anammox sludge was able to be linked with the anammox activity via reduced cytochrome c content fig 7 besides anaob anammox sludge harbor different kinds of microorganism which also together determine the overall anammox activity li et al 2020 the rda analysis proved that heme c content could explain 69 6 of the total variation of microbial community at the genus level which correlated positively with the relative abundance of dominant anaob candidatus kuenenia table 2 fig 6 what s more the summary of the literature data showed that the content of heme c the key component of cytochrome c correlated significantly with saa under various working conditions r 0 71 p 0 01 fig 8 which further provide the evidence that the sludge chromaticity arised by cytochrome c could be applied to indicate the anammox activity 4 3 implications of this study compared with the sophisticated online sensors or labor consuming off line chemical analyses in the monitoring of process performance the chromaticity of anammox sludge is an alternative option since it can be determined online and nondestructively therefore it is helpful to establish the relationship between chromaticity of anammox sludge and working performance of anammox system as well as to reveal the linking mechanism between chromaticity and activity for the optimization and development of anammox system although only the steady state anammox systems were investigated at different nlrs in this study the typical working states were fully covered any instantaneous working state could be fit into the interval of typical working states moreover the quantitate correlation equation between chroma and saa fig 1d ccs gene abundance fig 4b and specific hdh activity fig 5c were established in this study and by comparing the measured chroma value with the standard one obtained from the typical working states the abundance and activity of anaob could be ideally evaluated based on the correlation equations the color of sludge at typical steady states could be distinguished by naked eyes fig 1a while the commercialized colorimeters are preferred to analyze the chromaticity parameters in a higher precision in some cases the reflectance spectra could also be applied to reveal the detailed distribution of specific absorption bands to avoid color interference especially when treating the dye containing wastewaters however future work still needs to be done to further verify the feasibility of applying the sludge chromaticity parameters to monitor the working states of anammox system when treating real wastewaters in pilot full scale plants with varying conditions and improve the chromaticity database of anammox sludge 5

17575,the red color is the most striking character of anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anaob which has been used to estimate the anammox activity roughly however the quantitative relationship between the color and activity of anammox sludge still remains unknown in this study the chromaticity activity and their correlation were systematically investigated at different steady state nitrogen loading rates the chromaticity of anammox sludge was digitalized by the cie l a b color space the results revealed that the average chroma value was found to be significantly correlated with specific anammox activity r 0 940 p 0 01 and the cluster centers of chromaticity coordinates a b of anammox sludge were established to define the typical working states of anammox system the visible spectra of anammox sludge were proved to originate from the cytochrome c the correlation between chroma and heme c concentration of anammox sludge was consistent with the fully reduced cytochrome c and the chroma was determined by both content and redox ratio of cytochrome c the chromaticity of anammox sludge was able to be linked with the anammox activity via reduced cytochrome c content the gene abundance of cytochrome c synthetase linked the chromaticity with anaob quantity via total cytochrome c content while the enzyme activity of octaheme hydrazine dehydrogenase linked the chromaticity with anaob activity via reduced cytochrome c ratio moreover the redundancy analysis proved that heme c as the key component of cytochrome c was the most important explanatory variable accounting for the maximum 69 6 of the total variation of the anammox community which correlated positively with the relative abundance of dominant anaob candidatus kuenenia this work aimed at demonstrating the chromaticity of anammox sludge could be developed as an alternative intuitive anammox activity indicator which will promote the monitoring and optimization of anammox process graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox sludge chromaticity parameters cytochrome c metabolic activity microbial community 1 introduction anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox is a promising biological nitrogen removal process mediated by autotrophic anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anaob which are capable of converting ammonium and nitrite to dinitrogen gas kuenen 2008 kartal et al 2010 because of its high nitrogen removal efficiency no requirement for exogenous organics and aeration less surplus sludge production van loosdrecht and brdjanovic 2014 zhang et al 2019 anammox process has shown a broad application prospect in the wastewater treatment so far more than 200 full scale anammox facilities have been put into operation all over the world cao et al 2017 however the full scale application of anammox process still faces a great challenge due to the high sensitivity to environmental conditions the slow growing anammox consortia are vulnerable to the disturbance from misoperation even leading to the process breakdown therefore it is necessary to develop the real time process monitoring methods benefitting for the stability and robustness of anammox process while according to a current survey of full scale partial nitritation anammox plants they use a series of parameters among which ph and do concentration are the commonest on line monitoring indicators lackner et al 2014 although these parameters can reflect the physicochemical states of anammox process that affect the anammox rate they cannot indicate the physiological states of anaob that directly determine the anammox rate the molecular biology methods can be used to detect the quantity and activity of anaob but they need advanced instruments and complicated skills therefore it is necessary to develop a simple direct biological function related indicator for the monitoring and control of anammox process in an anammox system the functional bacteria form the sludge by self selection assembly and immobilization the microbial aggregates hold a unique microbial community with a specific spatial arrangement not only determining the anammox activity but also endowing the physical sludge a specific appearance which can serve as an auxiliary indicator to identify the metabolic activity d√≠az et al 2006 reported that the methanogenic granules took on black gray or brown color when they harbored different microbial communities with specific spatial structures which could indicate the physiological states of methanogenic microorganisms winkler et al 2011 observed that both red and white granules occurred in an anammox system harboring different dominant bacteria costa et al 2009 demonstrated that the morphological parameters especially filament length per aggregate area were an effective and timely indicator of high rate anaerobic systems color can be seen directly by human eyes and can also be perceived easily by the visual system in fact color has served as a biological index in many fields the ocean color spectra were associated with phytoplankton concentration to monitor fisheries and oceanic ecosystems mueller 1973 the color value a b of tomatoes was correlated with the lycopene content to indicate the tomato maturity arias et al 2000 the wine color was linked with the anthocyanins content to evaluate the quality of red wine han et al 2008 li et al 2019 investigated the synchronous response from the coefficient of variation cvh s of activated sludge color under different mixing conditions they proved that cvh s could reflect the change of operation parameters and it also held a similar trend with the respiration rate xu et al 2020b proposed that the color change of sludge during anaerobic digestion could indicate the anaerobic biochemical reactions of sludge organic matter the nondestructive quantification of color by the colorimeter makes the color as a viable option to monitor the anammox system it has been reported that the unique red color is one of the most striking physical properties of anammox sludge and can be roughly regarded as a mark of anammox activity imajo et al 2004 third et al 2005 tan et al 2020 however the quantitative relationships between the color value metabolic activity and microbial community of anammox sludge have not been established and the biological mechanism linking the color value to the physiological function of anaob has not been revealed either to understand the indicative function of sludge color and its mechanism the chromaticity of anammox sludge was systematically investigated within different anammox systems at the respective steady working states in this study the main work included 1 to characterize the chromaticity of anammox sludge at different nitrogen loads 2 to determine the visible spectra of anammox sludge and establish the correlation between chromaticity and cytochrome c 3 to link the cytochrome c with the quantity and activity of anaob 4 to analyze the correlation between chromaticity and microbial community the objective of this study was to investigate the correlation between chromaticity and activity of anammox sludge and reveal their linking mechanism which can promote the monitoring and control of anammox process with chromaticity as an intuitive biological index 2 materials and methods 2 1 anammox sludge the anammox sludge designated s0

ferousi et al 2013 the gene abundance of cytochrome c synthetase ccs could represent the total cytochrome c content which has also been developed to quantify the anaob zhou et al 2017 hydrazine oxidoreductase play a key role in anammox metabolic pathway and the hzo gene abundance could represent the enzyme quantity 0 25 g wet anammox sludge were used to extract the genomic dna following the

ggactachvgggtwtctaat muyzer et al 1993 the raw data sequenced by illumina miseq pe300 platform majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china was submitted to ncbi national center for biotechnology information under the accession number of srp159318 the data were further analyzed online by the platform of majorbio i sanger cloud platform www i sanger com 2 9 statistical analysis the chromaticity data were statistically analyzed by the software spss 20 0 box plots were applied to eliminate the outliers of data and the nonparametric tests independent samples kruskal wallis test are used for multi group difference test the k means cluster center initialization algorithm was conducted to cluster the chromaticity coordinates of anammox sludge and the average value was provided as the initial cluster center redundancy analysis rda was performed to analyze the correlation between chromaticity and microbial community using the multivariate data analysis software canoco 5 0 one way anova was applied to characterize the differences between two groups p 0 05 represents the significant differences and p 0 01 represents the extremely significant differences 3 results 3 1 chromaticity of anammox sludge at different nitrogen loads as shown in fig 1a the anammox sludge from different steady state reactors at their respective nitrogen loading rates nlrs took on different colors to characterize the sludge color quantitatively the cie l a b color space was applied and the chromaticity parameters of anammox sludge were obtained the results showed that the average chroma of anammox sludge had significant differences p 0 01 nonparametric kruskal wallis tests among the reactors the average value of chroma of s0 to s3 increased from 4 99 2 71 to 19 01 2 70 but the counterpart of s4 dropped to 15 69 1 46 fig 1b the exceptional decline of s4 was ascribed to the inhibition of high substrate concentration the chromaticity diagram displayed the distribution of sludge chromaticity points a b in a two dimensional coordinate system the k means clustering algorithm was applied to cluster the chromaticity coordinates of anammox sludge and five cluster centers were obtained for each working state as s0 1 97 3 96 s1 4 24 9 40 s2 7 49 14 52 s3 12 95 16 20 s4 9 38 12 29 fig 1c the euclidean distance between the cluster centers was shown in table s1 the average clustering accuracy could reach 71 7 table 1 by pearson correlation analysis chroma had a significant correlation with specific anammox activity saa of sludge r 0 940 p 0 01 which could be fitted into the linear equation as y 188 21x 28 10 r2 0 866 fig 1d therefore the chromaticity coordinates of anammox sludge could be applied to indicate the steady working states of anammox system 3 2 visible spectra of anammox sludge the color of object results from the way it reflects the particular wavelength of the light that falls on it to reveal the chromogenic mechanism of anammox sludge the visible spectra of crude enzyme were determined cytochrome c is proposed to be the key chromogenic substance of anaob kartal and keltjens 2016 the spectrum of cytochrome c differs in its two redox states spinazzi et al 2012 as seen from fig 2 a the reduced cytochrome c displayed three specific absorption bands which were 549 nm 520 nm 412 nm while the oxidized cytochrome c displayed two specific absorption bands which were 528 nm and 409 nm compared with the standard cytochrome c solution the visible spectra of anammox sludge had nearly the same specific absorption bands as the oxidized cytochrome c fig 2b f in the traditional color wheel model the complementary color at 409 nm purple 380 420 nm represents yellow b value while the counterpart at 528 nm green 495 570 nm shows red color a value the maximum absorption intensity of anammox sludge at around 409 nm increased from 2 476 s0 to 4 491 s3 and then dropped to 3 717 s4 which was consistent with the color channel b variation r 0 956 p 0 007 the specific absorption band of s0 at 528 nm was not detected and the overall absorption intensity around 0 724 of s0 was higher than that of other sludge resulting in the weak reflection intensity and the dark color with both low a and b value the absorption intensity of s1 to s4 firstly went up from 0 347 to 0 629 and then declined to 0 604 which matched the trend of color channel a r 0 904 p 0 018 3 3 heme c content and its relevance to chroma the red color of anaob was deduced to be derived from the high content of cytochrome c revealed by genomes sequencing analysis which could account for more than 30 of the total proteins cirpus et al 2005 cytochrome c contains heme c which is capable of oxidation and reduction as its iron atom converts between the ferrous and ferric forms the cytochrome c content of anammox sludge could be estimated by directly determining the heme c content the results showed that the extracted heme c of anammox sludge was mainly in the oxidized state accounting for 97 1 3 0 p 0 05 which was consistent with the visible spectra the heme c content stayed at a low level 0 69 0 88 Œºmol g vss when the anammox sludge was at the nlr less than 0 72 kg n m3 d a large increase to 1 87 0 15 Œºmol g vss was observed when the nlr was elevated to 5 05 kg n m3 d the highest heme c content reached 2 14 0 21 Œºmol g vss of s3 and then fell back to 2 06 0 08 Œºmol g vss of s4 p 0 05 fig 3 a to investigate the correlation between sludge chromaticity and cytochrome c content a series of gradient concentrations of standard fully reduced cytochrome c solutions were prepared fig s1 and the chroma was shown to have a positive correlation with the heme c concentration fitting the linear equation y 0 616x 6 459 r2 0 990 fig 3b the overall chroma of anammox sludge well fitted the correlation equation of fully reduced standard cytochrome c solutions which proved that the reduced cytochrome c content determined the chromaticity of anammox sludge 3 4 ccs gene abundance of anaob the type ‚Ö± cytochrome c maturation pathway has been identified in anaob genomics ferousi et al 2013 in the pathway the transmembrane proteins ccsab transport the heme molecule into the anammoxosome and maintain it in a reduced state then combined with the apocytochrome c to form the functional reduced c type cytochrome frawley and kranz 2009 therefore the ccs gene abundance could represent the total cytochrome c amount at the gene level the results showed that the ccs gene abundance of s0 at the storage state was as low as 3 01 0 92 1010 copies g vss an obvious increase was observed with a slight elevation of nlr to 0 72 kg n m3 d with the further elevation of nlr the ccs gene abundance increased from 2 60 0 32 1011 to the maximum 4 90 0 59 1011 copies g vss of s3 and then dropped to 4 44 0 18 1011 copies g vss of s4 fig 4 a moreover the ccs gene abundance was proved to be able to characterize the anaob quantity zhou et al 2017 chroma correlated significantly with the ccs gene abundance r 0 947 p 0 01 fitting the equation y 2 65 10 11 x 5 03 r2 0 863 fig 4b therefore the chromaticity of anammox sludge could be linked to the anaob quantity via the total cytochrome c amount revealed by ccs gene abundance 3 5 hzo gene abundance and hydrazine dehydrogenase activity of anaob the hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh is the key enzyme of anammox pathway converting hydrazine to dinitrogen gas which is also the largest soluble multiheme c type cytochrome complex containing a 192 heme electron transfer network akram et al 2019 to figure out the correlation between cytochrome c and metabolic activity the hzo gene abundance and specific hdh activity were determined to characterize the metabolic activity of anaob the results showed that the hzo gene abundance of s0 at the storage state was as low as 8 47 7 73 1010 copies g vss the hzo gene abundance of s1 increased largely with a slight elevation of nlr to 0 72 kg n m3 d with the further elevation of nlr the hzo gene abundance increased from 1 06 0 07 1012 to 1 58 1 72 1012 copies g vss but no significant difference existed between s3 and s4 p 0 05 fig 5 a accordingly the specific hdh activity of s0 also had the lowest value of 24 43 4 12 Œºmol cyt c reduced g vss min with the elevation of nlr the specific hdh activity went up and reached the maximum 1105 65 144 49 Œºmol cyt c reduced g vss min of s3 and then dropped to 487 72 54 82 Œºmol cyt c reduced g vss min of s4 fig 5b moreover chroma correlated significantly with the specific hdh activity r 0 897 p 0 05 fitting the equation y 3 62ln x 6 80 r2 0 996 fig 5c the hdh activity represents the ability of reducing oxidized cytochrome c with the increase of enzyme activity the reduced cytochrome c ratio can also be enhanced which will cause the decline of chroma fig s3d and level off the correlation curve fig 5c therefore the chromaticity of anammox sludge could be linked to the anaob activity via the reduced cytochrome c ratio revealed by specific hdh activity 3 6 redundancy analysis rda of quantitative correlation between chromaticity and microbial community anammox sludge harbors a series of specific microorganisms which together determine the specific anammox activity the composition and succession of microbial community at different nlrs were determined by the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing the quantitative relationship between chromaticity and microbial community were further investigated by the constrained ordination technique and rda analysis the relative abundance of genera in the anammox sludge was listed in table 2 candidatus kuenenia and anaerolineaceae norank were the most dominant genera in all the anammox systems at different nlrs the former belonged to planctomycetes and was the dominant anaob surprisingly after a long term starvation the candidatus kuenenia of s0 still had the relative abundance of 0 199 which proved that anaob went through the dormancy with the number and activity at a low but constant level xu et al 2020a with the elevation of nlr the relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia increased from 0 100 to 0 443 and then dropped to 0 344 which was consistent with the anammox activity anaerolineaceae was a common family found in anaerobic sludge which was assumed to be the primary degraders of dissolved organic matter zhang et al 2018 decreasing from 0 244 to 0 133 the rda analysis as displayed in fig 6 revealed that the samples at different nlrs were able to be separated clearly indicating the obvious shift of microbial community the first and second canonical axes represented 74 6 and 16 7 of variation respectively s0 had the richest microbial diversity while candidatus kuenenia was absolutely dominant in s2 and s3 the heme c content has explained the maximum 69 6 of total variation in the microbial community p 0 03 the heme c content had a strong positive correlation with both chroma and saa the distribution of microbial community was clearly divided into two opposite directions the relative abundance of candidatus kuenenia chloroflexi denitratisoma and brocadiaceae unclassified contributed positively to the chroma while the occurrence of nitrospira ardenticatenia anaerolineaceae limnobacter thiobacillus sm1a02 and candidatus brocadia resulted in the decline of chroma 4 discussion 4 1 chromaticity coordinates divided the working states of anammox process in this study the chromaticity of anammox sludge at different nitrogen loadings was characterized quantitively to establish the chromaticity coordinates to define the typical working states of anammox system due to the color heterogeneity of anammox sludge the color of random single granular sludge was digitalized by the cie l a b color space which is a simple direct and precise color measuring method tkalcic and tasic 2003 based on the data driven analysis the overall chroma had a positive correlation with specific anammox activity fig 1d and according to the pattern of chromaticity coordinates a b the performance of anammox systems could be visually divided into several typical working states i e performance intervals each typical steady state had the specific cluster center of chromaticity coordinates table 1 and an instantaneous working state could be fit into the performance interval and you can tell its performance by observing and comparing the chromaticity of anammox sludge at steady states despite some bias caused by the internal color heterogeneity the overall accuracy still could reach 71 7 which could be further increased by optimizing the sample amount and clustering algorithm of chromaticity parameters of anammox sludge 4 2 cytochrome c linked the chromaticity with activity of anammox sludge color is a vital physical characteristic that arises from the selective absorption of visible light which can be seen directly by the human eyes what is the chromogenic substance of anammox sludge considering ferrous iron is heavily needed by anaob and is routinely added in the medium van de graaf et al 1996 ferousi et al 2017 it was speculated at first the red colored iron precipitate on the surface could be the chromogenic substance but the x ray powder diffraction xrd results showed no crystalline chemicals were detected on the surface of anammox sludge and no obvious differences were observed among different working states anaob has been assumed to be the chromogenic source which held a high content of cytochrome c type proteins endowing the red color kartal et al 2013 moreover the optical visible spectra of anammox sludge at different working states showed the specific absorption bands of anammox sludge was consistent with that of standard oxidized cytochrome c solution fig 2 and the main absorption bands corresponded to the color channels a and b value separately which supported that cytochrome c was the main chromogenic source cytochrome c is an important part involved in the electron transport chain and it has been well established that the iron containing heme is the basic chromogenic molecule of cytochrome c nelson et al 2008 due to the interchange of fe2 and fe3 at the center of porphyrin ring the cytochrome c cycles between the reduced and oxidized state which exhibits the different colors accompanying the spectrum change fig s3 therefore both the content and redox ratio of cytochrome c could affect the chromaticity of anammox sludge although the heme c extract of anammox sludge was in oxidized form which is probably due to the exposure to the air during the extraction the relationship between the sludge chroma and heme c concentration agrees well with the fully reduced cytochrome c fig 3b chroma is a combination value of color channels a and b when the chromaticity coordinate a b of anammox sludge was compared with that of standard fully reduced cytochrome c if all of them were in the fully reduced state the a should be correlated linearly with b fig s3b but it can be seen from fig 1c that with the increase of a the b tended to maintain stable in addition when the specific hdh activity increased more cytochrome c can be reduced which enhanced the reduced cytochrome c ratio leading to the decline of chroma and flattened the curve fig 5c therefore it can be deduced that with the increase of anammox activity both the content and redox ratio of cytochrome c determined the sludge chromaticity the anammox activity of sludge depend on both the quantity and activity of anaob cytochrome c synthetase is the key transmembrane protein of regulating the production of cytochrome c the higher the ccs gene abundance the more heme molecules are transferred into the anammoxosome and the more cytochromes c could be produced the ccs gene abundance has been designed to detect the anaob quantity and chroma was proved to be significantly correlated with the ccs gene abundance r 0 947 p 0 01 fig 4b therefore the ccs gene abundance linked the chromaticity of anammox sludge to anaob quantity via the total cytochrome c content hdh as one of the key enzymes of anammox metabolic pathway determines the anammox activity directly hdh contains a large cytochromes c electron transfer network the higher the enzyme activity the more cytochromes c are at the reduced state at the starvation state the substrate supply was insufficient to produce enough electron to maintain the reduced state resulting in the decrease of its proportion while at the poison state the enzyme was inhibited by the high substrate concentration causing the decrease of reduced form as well chroma was proved to be significantly correlated with the specific hdh activity r 0 897 p 0 05 fig 5c therefore the specific hdh activity linked the chromaticity of anammox sludge to anaob activity via the reduced cytochrome c ratio taken together the chromaticity of anammox sludge was able to be linked with the anammox activity via reduced cytochrome c content fig 7 besides anaob anammox sludge harbor different kinds of microorganism which also together determine the overall anammox activity li et al 2020 the rda analysis proved that heme c content could explain 69 6 of the total variation of microbial community at the genus level which correlated positively with the relative abundance of dominant anaob candidatus kuenenia table 2 fig 6 what s more the summary of the literature data showed that the content of heme c the key component of cytochrome c correlated significantly with saa under various working conditions r 0 71 p 0 01 fig 8 which further provide the evidence that the sludge chromaticity arised by cytochrome c could be applied to indicate the anammox activity 4 3 implications of this study compared with the sophisticated online sensors or labor consuming off line chemical analyses in the monitoring of process performance the chromaticity of anammox sludge is an alternative option since it can be determined online and nondestructively therefore it is helpful to establish the relationship between chromaticity of anammox sludge and working performance of anammox system as well as to reveal the linking mechanism between chromaticity and activity for the optimization and development of anammox system although only the steady state anammox systems were investigated at different nlrs in this study the typical working states were fully covered any instantaneous working state could be fit into the interval of typical working states moreover the quantitate correlation equation between chroma and saa fig 1d ccs gene abundance fig 4b and specific hdh activity fig 5c were established in this study and by comparing the measured chroma value with the standard one obtained from the typical working states the abundance and activity of anaob could be ideally evaluated based on the correlation equations the color of sludge at typical steady states could be distinguished by naked eyes fig 1a while the commercialized colorimeters are preferred to analyze the chromaticity parameters in a higher precision in some cases the reflectance spectra could also be applied to reveal the detailed distribution of specific absorption bands to avoid color interference especially when treating the dye containing wastewaters however future work still needs to be done to further verify the feasibility of applying the sludge chromaticity parameters to monitor the working states of anammox system when treating real wastewaters in pilot full scale plants with varying conditions and improve the chromaticity database of anammox sludge 5 conclusion in this study the chromaticity activity and their correlation of anammox sludge was systematically investigated at different steady state nitrogen loading rates and the main conclusions were drawn as follows 1 the chroma was significantly correlated with specific anammox activity r 0 940 p 0 01 the cluster centers of chromaticity coordinates a b of anammox sludge were established as

proved to originate from cytochrome c and the correlation between chroma and heme c concentration of anammox sludge agrees well with the fully reduced cytochrome c fitting the linear equation y 0 616x 6 459 r2 0 990 3 the chromaticity of anammox sludge was able to be linked with the anammox activity via reduced cytochrome c content the ccs gene abundance linked the chromaticity with anaob quantity via total cytochrome c content while the specific hdh activity linked the chromaticity with anaob activity via reduced cytochrome c ratio 4 the heme c content accounted for the maximum 69 6 of total variation in the microbial community p 0 03 by redundancy analysis and correlated significantly with saa under different working conditions r 0 71 p 0 01 declaration of competing interest the authors

17576,the catalytic hydrogel membrane reactor chmr is a promising new technology for hydrogenation of aqueous contaminants in drinking water it offers numerous benefits over conventional three phase reactors including immobilization of nano catalysts high reactivity and control over the hydrogen h2 supply concentration in this study a computational model of the chmr was developed using aquasim and calibrated with 32 experimental datasets for a nitrite no2 reducing chmr using palladium pd nano catalysts 4 6 nm the model was then used to identify key factors impacting the behavior of the chmr including hydrogel catalyst density h2 supply pressure influent and bulk no2 concentrations and hydrogel thickness based on the model calibration the reaction rate constants for the no2 steady state adsorption hinshelwood reaction equation k1 and k2 were 0 0039 m3 mole pd 1 s 1 and 0 027 mole h2 m3 1 2 mole pd 1 s 1 respectively the reactant flux which is the overall no2 removal rate for the chmr is affected by the no2 reduction rate at each catalyst site which is in turn controlled by the available no2 and h2 concentrations that are regulated by their mass transport behavior reactant transport in the chmr is counter diffusional so for thick hydrogels the concurrent concentrations of no2 and h2 are limiting in the middle region along the x y plane of the hydrogel which results in a low overall no2 removal rate i e flux thinner hydrogels provide higher concurrent reactant concentrations throughout the hydrogel resulting in higher fluxes however if the hydrogel is too thin the flux becomes limited by the amount of pd that can be loaded and unused h2 can diffuse into the bulk and promote biofilm growth the hydrogel thickness that maximized the no2 flux ranged between 30 and 150 Œºm for the conditions tested the computational model is the first to describe chmr behavior and it is an important tool for the further development of the chmr it also can be adapted to assess

hydrogel aquasim 1 introduction heterogeneous hydrogenation catalysis hhc is an effective approach for treating water containing oxidized contaminants such as nitrate nitrite bromate chlorate and perchlorate chaplin et al 2012 in hhc hydrogen h2 dissociates on the catalyst s surface to form highly reactive metal hydrides that can subsequently reduce the adsorbed contaminant in conventional three phase hhc reactors e g packed bed bubble column h2 g is typically bubbled directly into solution or water droplets are dispersed in the gas this poses numerous complications including mass transfer limitations low h2 g solubility in water loss of h2 g with the off gases and safety concerns due to the combustibility of h2 g bergquist 2017 bertoch et al 2017 choe et al 2015 an emerging type of hhc reactor that offers numerous benefits over conventional three phase reactors is the interfacial catalytic membrane reactor icmr aran et al 2011 buonomenna et al 2010 chen et al 2003 daub et al 1999 dittmeyer et al 2001 dittmeyer et al 2004 espinosa et al 2016 espinosa et al 2018 postma et al 2018 strukul et al 2000 an icmr typically consists of a permeable membrane that separates the gas and liquid phases and the solid catalyst is in contact with the membrane for a gas permeable membrane used for hhc h2 g diffuses through the membrane wall and enters the liquid phase in a dissolved state because h2 is dissolved in solution the gas liquid diffusive barrier at the catalyst surface is eliminated and provides better overall transport kinetics the catalyst in an icmr is typically loaded directly onto the membrane surface or bound within an inorganic organic shell that is on the membrane it provides improved catalytic activity control over h2 g supply concentrations greater h2 transfer and use efficiency and catalyst immobilization the catalytic hydrogel membrane reactor chmr was developed as a new icmr for water treatment marks et al 2020 marks et al 2019 the chmr consists of a gas permeable hollow fiber membrane hfm pressurized with h2 g to deliver h2 directly to a catalyst bearing hydrogel layer coated on the hfm outer surface fig 1 a this provides numerous advantages over previous icmrs for example it is possible to regulate the h2 transfer fluxes and concentrations within the hydrogel by regulating the h2 gas pressure in the hfm there is no bulk liquid diffusive boundary resistance for h2 delivery to the hydrogel nerenberg 2016 the gas transfer efficiency can be as high as 100 if closed end hfms are used brindle et al 1998 hibiya et al 2003 martin and nerenberg 2012 pankhania et al 1999 perez calleja et al 2017 syron and casey 2008 higher removal rates per mass of catalyst are obtained because the catalyst is uniformly dispersed within a hydrogel rather than layered onto a surface and by using bundles of small diameter hfms typically with outer diameters of 300 600 Œºm high volumetric treatment rates can be achieved currently the chmr faces technical unknowns and barriers including the long term mechanical stability of the hydrogel catalyst deactivation and a lack of uniform hydrogel thickness along the hfm marks et al 2020 marks et al 2019 developing a predictive model will be useful for understanding the controls on these issues that will allow the chmr to be optimized the chmr operates by counter diffusional transport where h2 and the target contaminant e g no2 diffuse into the catalytic hydrogel from the hfm wall and bulk aqueous solution respectively fig 1b these contaminant fluxes are primarily determined by their concentrations within the hydrogel and the intrinsic catalytic reaction rates these are coupled because the concentrations in the hydrogel are affected by the reaction rates which in turn affects concentrations the concentrations in the hydrogel are also affected by the membrane and bulk concentrations of the h2 and contaminant respectively the membrane diffusional resistance the boundary layer resistance at the hydrogel water interface and the hydrogel thickness marks et al 2020 marks et al 2019 given the numerous affecting variables and coupled behavior a model is needed to better understand the rate limiting factors and to optimize the reactor performance similar models exist to describe counter diffusional biofilm performance essila et al 2000 semmens and essila 2001 yet no such model exists for the chmr the objective of this study was to develop a one dimensional 1 d computational model of the chmr the model was calibrated with experimental data marks et al 2020 and then used to describe the variables that control the performance of the chmr specifically the model was used to evaluate the effect of the hydrogel catalyst density h2 supply pressure influent and bulk no2 concentration and hydrogel thickness on the h2 and no2 concentration profiles the no2 reaction rate profiles and the no2 flux although nitrate no3 is arguably a more important water contaminant no2 is an acceptable model contaminant for creating this model because it is the first reduction step for the no3 hydrogenation reaction no3 would be a logical extension of the model using data from a suitable catalyst e g a pd in catalyst guo et al 2018 this is the first available computation model that describes the novel chmr it can be extended to any catalyst or reactant allowing for the input of different reaction expressions and reactor conditions and it can be applied to describe the behavior of other types of icmrs 2 model description 2 1 model setup a 1 d model of the chmr was constructed using the aquasim program version 2 1 an environmental simulation software for aquatic systems reichert 1994 aquasim allows for compartments e g completely mixed reactor to be coupled through either advective or diffusive links and analyzed as a single system the software includes a biofilm reactor compartment which is terminology taken directly from aquasim and is an analogue for the catalytic hydrogel in the chmr wanner and morgenroth 2004 the catalytic hydrogel can be modeled as a biofilm without growth or decay the catalyst may be considered analogous to autotrophic bacteria that use h2 as an electron donor for oxyanion reduction chung et al 2006 nerenberg and rittmann 2004 nerenberg et al 2002 ziv el and rittmann 2009 the chmr model consists of five distinct regions including 1 the h2 supplying hfm lumen 2 the hfm wall 3 the catalytic hydrogel 4 the liquid diffusion layer ldl and 5 the well mixed bulk aqueous solution fig 2 these regions operate under defined conditions and parameters the hfm lumen is modeled as a mixed reactor compartment containing only h2 g at a specified partial pressure the catalytic hydrogel ldl and bulk solution are modeled as a biofilm reactor compartment the ldl was incorporated into the biofilm compartment as a boundary layer resistance for no2 between the hydrogel and bulk solution the hfm wall is modeled as a diffusive link between the h2 supplying mixed compartment and biofilm reactor compartment the diffusive link is governed by henry s law h2 diffusivity for the hfm material and the hfm wall thickness 2 2 processes a useful model requires description of the physical and chemical processes that affect reactor performance and reactive species concentrations within the reactor the primary physical process that influences the reactivity is diffusion which drives the transport of reactive species within the hfm wall hydrogel and ldl diffusion is described by fick s first law martin and nerenberg 2012 which states that a species will travel from regions of high to low concentrations according to eq 1 1 j d e dc dx where j is flux mol m 2 s 1 de is effective diffusivity m2 s 1 and dc dx is the concentration gradient of the diffusing species dc through the diffusion layer dx flux represents the amount of the species transported through a specific cross sectional area in a specific amount of time fickian diffusion results in a linear concentration gradient across the diffusive regions including the hfm wall the non reactive areas of the hydrogel and the ldl the conversion of h2 from the gas phase to the aqueous phase as it diffuses through the hfm wall is governed by the liquid gas equilibrium constant described by henry s law martin et al 2015 a single chemical reaction process was used in the model the catalytic hydrogenation of the contaminant no2 was the contaminant and palladium pd the catalyst the assumed hydrogenation reaction stoichiometry is described in equation 2 where 3 moles of h2 are consumed per 2 moles of no2 2 2 no 2 3 h 2 2 h n 2 4 h 2 o the reduction rate for the catalytic hydrogenation of no2 using pd can be described by the steady state adsorption

and calibration the model provides concentration profiles of no2 and h2 within the catalytic hydrogel and concentrations in the bulk aqueous solution based on the processes described previously a complete account of the model parameters is given in table 1 reactor configuration parameters such as flowrate reactor volume and hfm silicone wall thickness were obtained from previous experimental studies marks et al 2020 the diffusion coefficients for h2 and no2 in water and h2 in the silicone hfm wall were obtained from previous studies ferrell and himmelblau 1967 merkel et al 2000 sabba et al 2017 the diffusivity ratio f was estimated from assuming similar diffusion behavior in biofilms stewart 2003 and then adjusted during calibration the surface area of the hydrogel was calculated assuming it had a perfect cylindrical shape the model was calibrated using data from 32 experiments from a previous study on a lab scale chmr operated as a completely mixed reactor marks et al 2020 in that study the no2 reduction rate was evaluated as a function of influent no2 h2 supply pressure and pd density in the hydrogel the results of these experiments are provided in table si 1 the average hydrogel thickness of fibers used that study were approximately 450 Œºm e g fig si 1 but due to the extreme variability in the hydrogel thickness homogeneity e g gaps the thickness was considered a variable for fitting in this study and termed the effective hydrogel thickness to calibrate the model the unknown parameters including the k 1 and k 2 rate constants for the no2 reduction rate expression eq 3 the effective hydrogel thickness l the diffusivity ratio f and the diffusivities of no2 and h2 were determined using the aquasim parameter estimation tool which fit time based no2 concentration profiles to experimental data no2 concentrations for each experimental run were input in the model as real list variables with time as the argument to allow the model to fit the experimental data the run conditions i e h2 pressure influent no2 concentration and pd density were included as real list variables with calculation number as the argument in the parameter estimation function the unknown parameters were set active while the active calculations matched the experimental no2 concentrations to their respective calculation number variables the function requires minimum and maximum values for each unknown variable to be considered during numerous iterations minimizing œá2 both rate constants were bound between zero and one the effective hydrogel thickness was bound between zero and the average hydrogel thickness the diffusivity ratio was bound between zero and one and both diffusivities were bound in a range of one half to two times literature values while the parameter estimation minimized the total œá2 the resulting model fit one catalyst loading better than the other following the parameter estimation the rate constants and effective hydrogel thickness were manually adjusted by a trial and error approach by minimizing the residual sum of squares rss eq 4 4 rss i 1 n ob s i ca l i 2 where cal and obs are the calculated and observed values the model goodness of fit was determined by the coefficient of determination r 2 eq 5 5 r 2 rss i 1 n ob s i obs 2 where the accent bar represents the mean value this was calculated by comparing the calculated flux to the observed flux i e table si 1 2 4 model simulations the model simulated steady state behavior for a continuous flow chmr the model was used to evaluate the effect of the hydrogel catalyst density h2 supply pressure influent no2 and bulk concentration and hydrogel thickness on the no2 flux no2 reaction rate eq 3 and h2 and no2 concentration profiles the no2 flux j no2 g n m 2 d 1 was calculated using eq 6 6 j no 2 q in c inf c eff a where c inf is the influent no2 concentration mm and c eff mm is the steady state bulk concentration the flux represents the mass of no2 removed per day per area of hydrogel it is equal to the integral of the no2 reaction rate profile within the hydrogel i e integration with respect to position within the hydrogel 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration through the model calibration no2 diffusivity h2 diffusivity and the diffusivity ratio were estimated to be 3 8 10 9 m2 s 1 5 5 10 9 m2 s 1 and 0 97 respectively using the aquasim parameter estimation the k 1 k 2 and effective hydrogel thickness variables were initially estimated to be 0 0032 m3 mole pd 1 s 1 0 012 mole h2 m3 1 2 mole pd 1 s 1 and 106 Œºm respectively to further improve the fit these parameters were then manually adjusted to 0 0039 m3 mole pd 1 s 1 0 027 mole h2 m3 1 2 mole pd 1 s 1 and 100 Œºm respectively the model was used to calculate theoretical fluxes that were compared to the experimentally calculated fluxes for the conditions tested fig 3 table si 1 overall the model prediction was very good with a minimal rss 9 9 eq 4 and an r2 0 96 eq 5 but there were some points that did not lie on their respective model curves there are a few potential reasons for this deviation first for simplicity the model assumes that n2 is the sole byproduct with no nh4 formation however the selectivity to n2 and nh4 shifts with changing h2 and no2 concentrations within the hydrogel marks et al 2020 marks et al 2019 this change in the stoichiometry would alter the reduction rates and thus flux second the data is based on single experimental runs and thus there is no statistical error reported there is presumably some experimental variability especially at the lower h2 partial pressure and influent no2 experiments where the rates and conversion were low i e bottom curve in fig 3b as predicted by the model increasing the pd density resulted in higher fluxes generally increasing the available h2 or no2 increases the flux but at lower h2 supply pressures 0 3 atm the reaction became h2 limited such that increasing the available no2 did not increase the flux this was more severe for the lower pd density the flux is related to the sum of the catalytic rates at each point in the hydrogel this is controlled by the available h2 and no2 which is controlled by their mass transport rate with the calibrated model the influence of these variables can be evaluated to explain what controls the no2 flux 3 2 effect of catalytic hydrogel thickness on flux due to the counter diffusional nature of the chmr where the reactants h2 and no2 diffuse from opposite sides into the hydrogel the hydrogel thickness can have a significant impact on the no2 flux fig 4 shows the no2 flux as a function of hydrogel thickness for various pd densities the influent flowrate influent no2 concentration and h2 supply pressure are constant a higher pd density results in increased flux for all conditions but for hydrogels above approximately 500 ¬µm increasing the pd density does not provide appreciable increases in flux this is due to the low availability of h2 and no2 at pd sites this affects the no2 reduction rate as explained below when the hydrogel thickness is large the concurrent reactant concentrations are low due to mass transport resistance in the hydrogel thus the flux is low however decreasing the hydrogel thickness does not guarantee increased flux if the hydrogel is too thin the available pd active sites becomes limiting for all pd densities tested the optimal flux occurs when the hydrogel thickness is between 30 and 150 ¬µm and the optimal thickness for peak flux decreases with increasing pd density as such some outer catalyst bearing layer is required and simply adding catalyst directly to the surface of the hfm will not provide efficient reaction conditions note the optimal thickness range will also change if the influent flow influent no2 and supplied h2 are changed given a set of conditions this model can be used to determine the optimal hydrogel thickness that can guide improved synthesis of the chmr the impact of hydrogel thickness of the flux can be explained by evaluating the h2 and no2 concentration and no2 reduction rate profiles within the hydrogel 3 3 effect of the hydrogel thickness and pd density on the no2 and h2 concentrations and no2 reduction rate in the hydrogel profile as described by eq 3 the no2 reduction rate is dependent on the concentrations of no2 h2 and pd density in the hydrogel thus this reaction only occurs in the catalytic hydrogel in regions where h2 and no2 are concurrent defined herein as the reactive zone rz in this region the flux of h2 and no2 are influenced by both fickian diffusion eq 2 and the no2 reduction rate eq 3 which are dependent on localized h2 and no2 concentrations transport of h2 or no2 in the catalytic hydrogel where the opposing reactant is not present is governed solely by diffusion and this region is termed herein as the non reactive zone nrz due to the counter diffusional nature of the chmr the hydrogel thickness impacts the concurrent h2 and no2 concentrations in the hydrogel this in turn affects the localized reaction rate at pd sites and thus flux fig 5 shows the h2 and no2 concentration and no2 reduction rate profiles for two hydrogel thicknesses thick 800 ¬µm and thin 50 ¬µm and two pd densities 200 and 10 mole pd m 3 hydrogel using the results from fig 4 the two thicknesses were chosen to represent a thinner hydrogel that is affected by the pd density and a thicker hydrogel that is less sensitive to pd density the influent flowrate influent no2 concentration and h2 supply pressure are constant and are the same as that in fig 4 for a thick hydrogel fig 5a and c fig si 2a the reactant concentration profiles are dominated by mass transport limitations h2 and no2 must diffuse far into the hydrogel before meeting at pd active sites for the low pd density fig 5a this results in a broad rz 500 Œºm with respect to the total thickness 800 Œºm and low h2 and no2 concentrations in the rz resulting in low no2 reduction rates for the high pd density fig 5c the no2 reduction rates are higher because there are more pd active sites but this causes the rz to become narrower 200 Œºm the flux is the sum of all the rates within the hydrogel i e the integral of the rz thus only insignificant increases in flux occur when increasing the pd density due to mass transfer limitations of the thicker hydrogel for example the flux for the 200 and 10 mole pd m 3 hydrogel densities are 0 674 and 0 668 gn m 2 d 1 or a 1 difference this confirms the results from fig 4 showing a convergence of the fluxes for the pd densities with increasing thickness thus for thick hydrogels much of the hydrogel is either no2 or h2 concentration limited i e the nrz and only a small portion of the pd is being used for thin hydrogels fig 5b and d fig si 2b h2 and no2 are present throughout the hydrogel layer and the rz encompasses the full hydrogel profile for all pd densities tested because all the pd in the hydrogel is being used increasing the pd density results in a higher no2 reduction rate throughout the hydrogel layer though for higher densities the reaction starts to become no2 limited closer to the hfm wall fig 5d fig si 2 increasing the pd density leads to noticeable increases in flux for example the flux for the 200 and 10 mole pd m 3 hydrogel densities is 4 94 and 0 965 gn m 2 d 1 respectively 3 4 effect of the no2 and h2 concentrations on the concentration and rate profiles one of the major benefits of the chmr over conventional three phase catalyst systems is the ability to control the h2 supply pressure to maintain an optimal rate and conversion in realistic operating situations the pd density will be relatively constant but the influent no2 concentration may have seasonal changes the h2 partial pressure can be easily adjusted to match fluctuating no2 concentrations further as seen in fig 5 the h2 and no2 concentrations can greatly impact the overall reaction rate fig 6 demonstrates four scenarios for combinations of low and high influent h2 and no2 concentrations the influent flowrate pd density and hydrogel thickness were constant a hydrogel thickness of 200 Œºm was chosen so the reactant profiles and changes in the no2 rate can be easily distinguished with reactant concentration changes when the influent no2 concentration 1 mm and h2 supply pressure 0 3 atm are relatively low the peak no2 reduction rate is low and the rz is narrow fig 6a this results in a flux of 1 96 gn m 2 d 1 if the influent no2 concentration increases to 5 mm with no change in the h2 supply pressure fig 6b then the h2 becomes limiting resulting in an rz that is shifted toward the hfm but because the available no2 is higher higher no2 reduction rates are achieved across a narrower rz resulting in a flux increase to 5 33 gn m 2 d 1 if the h2 supply pressure is increased to 4 0 atm to match the increasing influent no2 5 mm fig 6c then the rz broadens while maintaining a high peak no2 reduction rate this results again in a flux increase to 13 36 gn m 2 d 1 however a higher h2 supply pressure is not always better if the h2 remains at 4 0 atm but the influent no2 drops back down to 1 mm fig 6d then the rz is shifted toward the bulk while an increased flux is observed 1 96 to 4 17 gn m 2 d 1 there is still h2 remaining at the hydrogel bulk interface this results in wasted h2 and the excess h2 can diffuse into the bulk which may promote the growth of bacterial biofilms that use h2 as an electron donor substrate thus as depicted by the modeling results the ability to control the h2 feed pressure such that h2 remains optimal throughout the rz is an advantage of the chmr compared to other catalytic reactors 4 conclusions this study focused on development of a 1 d model to describe the chmr this model can be used to evaluate the overall contaminant removal rate i e flux the h2 and contaminant concentrations within the hydrogel and the contaminant removal rates within the hydrogel this model can be extended to any hydrogenation catalyst e g rh ru pd in or reactant e g nitrate bromate perchlorate trichloroethylene allowing for the input of different reaction expressions and reactor conditions the model can also be extended to other icmrs that comprise of a mixed gas compartment linked diffusively to a catalytic layer that is analogous to a biofilm to improve the chmr model for no2 or no3 hydrogenation we suggest incorporating the effects of ph on catalytic activity basic ph greatly inhibits the reaction and because oh is a reaction byproduct the reaction is naturally inhibited unless ph control is employed ebbesen et al 2011 matatov meytal et al 2003 co2 bubbling is a simple buffer that can prevent a ph increase and can be included in the model either in the hfm or hydrogel reactor compartment inclusion of o2 in the model is another possible improvement as o2 will react with h2 preferentially over pd catalysts forming h2o2 and h2o which may affect reaction kinetics if there is sufficient competition with no2 for active sites centi et al 2003 another critical aspect of no2 no3 hydrogenation is selectivity inclusion of nh4 formation in a model is likely not viable considering the current limited understanding of the reaction pathway hu et al 2018 future work developing this understanding for inclusion would greatly enhance the value of such a model as the ability of the system to maintain nh4 concentrations below regulated levels is critical for drinking water applications finally the model could be improved by including a wider range of reactant concentrations along with further validation of the model through experimental repetitions development of a two dimensional 2 d model will greatly enhance the capabilities of a model to properly predict chmr performance in real world conditions it would provide information about changes along the axial and latitudinal positions within the chmr this would allow for investigation of the development of h2 concentration gradients that occur when the hfm lumen is supplied with h2 in open or closed mode operation marks et al 2020 the benefits of periodic venting of the hfm lumen on h2 consumption efficiency while maintaining high catalytic activity have been demonstrated experimentally for chmrs and through modeling of membrane biofilm reactors perez calleja et al 2017 development of a 2 d model in a program such as comsol would allow for optimization of the venting procedure to maximize the critical venting parameters of vent period and interval

chmr consists of a gas permeable hollow fiber membrane hfm pressurized with h2 g to deliver h2 directly to a catalyst bearing hydrogel layer coated on the hfm outer surface fig 1 a this provides numerous advantages over previous icmrs for example it is possible to regulate the h2 transfer fluxes and concentrations within the hydrogel by regulating the h2 gas pressure in the hfm there is no bulk liquid diffusive boundary resistance for h2 delivery to the hydrogel nerenberg 2016 the gas transfer efficiency can be as high as 100 if closed end hfms are used brindle et al 1998 hibiya et al 2003 martin and nerenberg 2012 pankhania et al 1999 perez calleja et al 2017 syron and casey 2008 higher removal rates per mass of catalyst are obtained because the catalyst is uniformly dispersed within a hydrogel rather than layered onto a surface and by using bundles of small diameter hfms typically with outer diameters of 300 600 Œºm high volumetric treatment rates can be achieved currently the chmr faces technical unknowns and barriers including the long term mechanical stability of the hydrogel catalyst deactivation and a lack of uniform hydrogel thickness along the hfm marks et al 2020 marks et al 2019 developing a predictive model will be useful for understanding the controls on these issues that will allow the chmr to be optimized the chmr operates by counter diffusional transport where h2 and the target contaminant e g no2 diffuse into the catalytic hydrogel from the hfm wall and bulk aqueous solution respectively fig 1b these contaminant fluxes are primarily determined by their concentrations within the hydrogel and the intrinsic catalytic reaction rates these are coupled because the concentrations in the hydrogel are affected by the reaction rates which in turn affects concentrations the concentrations in the hydrogel are also affected by the membrane and bulk concentrations of the h2 and contaminant respectively the membrane diffusional resistance the boundary layer resistance at the hydrogel water interface and the hydrogel thickness marks et al 2020 marks et al 2019 given the numerous affecting variables and coupled behavior a model is needed to better understand the rate limiting factors and to optimize the reactor performance similar models exist to describe counter diffusional biofilm performance essila et al 2000 semmens and essila 2001 yet no such model exists for the chmr the objective of this study was to develop a one dimensional 1 d computational model of the chmr the model was calibrated with experimental data marks et al 2020 and then used to describe the variables that control the performance of the chmr specifically the model was used to evaluate the effect of the hydrogel catalyst density h2 supply pressure influent and bulk no2 concentration and hydrogel thickness on the h2 and no2 concentration profiles the no2 reaction rate profiles and the no2 flux although nitrate no3 is arguably a more important water contaminant no2 is an acceptable model contaminant for creating this model because it is the first reduction step for the no3 hydrogenation reaction no3 would be a logical extension of the model using data from a suitable catalyst e g a pd in catalyst guo et al 2018 this is the first available computation model that describes the novel chmr it can be extended to any catalyst or reactant allowing for the input of different reaction expressions and reactor conditions and it can be applied to describe the behavior of other types of icmrs 2 model description 2 1 model setup a 1 d model of the chmr was constructed using the aquasim program version 2 1 an environmental simulation software for aquatic systems reichert 1994 aquasim allows for compartments e g completely mixed reactor to be coupled through either advective or diffusive links and analyzed as a single system the software includes a biofilm reactor compartment which is terminology taken directly from aquasim and is an analogue for the catalytic hydrogel in the chmr wanner and morgenroth 2004 the catalytic hydrogel can be modeled as a biofilm without growth or decay the catalyst may be considered analogous to autotrophic bacteria that use h2 as an electron donor for oxyanion reduction chung et al 2006 nerenberg and rittmann 2004 nerenberg et al 2002 ziv el and rittmann 2009 the chmr model consists of five distinct regions including 1 the h2 supplying hfm lumen 2 the hfm wall 3 the catalytic hydrogel 4 the liquid diffusion layer ldl and 5 the well mixed bulk aqueous solution fig 2 these regions operate under defined conditions and parameters the hfm lumen is modeled as a mixed reactor compartment containing only h2 g at a specified partial pressure the catalytic hydrogel ldl and bulk solution are modeled as a biofilm reactor compartment the ldl was incorporated into the biofilm compartment as a boundary layer resistance for no2 between the hydrogel and bulk solution the hfm wall is modeled as a diffusive link between the h2 supplying mixed compartment and biofilm reactor compartment the diffusive link is governed by henry s law h2 diffusivity for the hfm material and the hfm wall thickness 2 2 processes a useful model requires description of the physical and chemical processes that affect reactor performance and reactive species concentrations within the reactor the primary physical process that influences the reactivity is diffusion which drives the transport of reactive species within the hfm wall hydrogel and ldl diffusion is described by fick s first law martin and nerenberg 2012 which states that a species will travel from regions of high to low concentrations according to eq 1 1 j d e dc dx where j is flux mol m 2 s 1 de is effective diffusivity m2 s 1 and dc dx is the concentration gradient of the diffusing species dc through the diffusion layer dx flux represents the amount of the species transported through a specific cross sectional area in a specific amount of time fickian diffusion results in a linear concentration gradient across the diffusive regions including the hfm wall the non reactive areas of the hydrogel and the ldl the conversion of h2 from the gas phase to the aqueous phase as it diffuses through the hfm wall is governed by the liquid gas equilibrium constant described by henry s law martin et al 2015 a single chemical reaction process was used in the model the catalytic hydrogenation of the contaminant no2 was the contaminant and palladium pd the catalyst the assumed hydrogenation reaction stoichiometry is described in equation 2 where 3 moles of h2 are consumed per 2 moles of no2 2 2 no 2 3 h 2 2 h n 2 4 h 2 o the reduction rate for the catalytic hydrogenation of no2 using pd can be described by the steady state adsorption

and calibration the model provides concentration profiles of no2 and h2 within the catalytic hydrogel and concentrations in the bulk aqueous solution based on the processes described previously a complete account of the model parameters is given in table 1 reactor configuration parameters such as flowrate reactor volume and hfm silicone wall thickness were obtained from previous experimental studies marks et al 2020 the diffusion coefficients for h2 and no2 in water and h2 in the silicone hfm wall were obtained from previous studies ferrell and himmelblau 1967 merkel et al 2000 sabba et al 2017 the diffusivity ratio f was estimated from assuming similar diffusion behavior in biofilms stewart 2003 and then adjusted during calibration the surface area of the hydrogel was calculated assuming it had a perfect cylindrical shape the model was calibrated using data from 32 experiments from a previous study on a lab scale chmr operated as a completely mixed reactor marks et al 2020 in that study the no2 reduction rate was evaluated as a function of influent no2 h2 supply pressure and pd density in the hydrogel the results of these experiments are provided in table si 1 the average hydrogel thickness of fibers used that study were approximately 450 Œºm e g fig si 1 but due to the extreme variability in the hydrogel thickness homogeneity e g gaps the thickness was considered a variable for fitting in this study and termed the effective hydrogel thickness to calibrate the model the unknown parameters including the k 1 and k 2 rate constants for the no2 reduction rate expression eq 3 the effective hydrogel thickness l the diffusivity ratio f and the diffusivities of no2 and h2 were determined using the aquasim parameter estimation tool which fit time based no2 concentration profiles to experimental data no2 concentrations for each experimental run were input in the model as real list variables with time as the argument to allow the model to fit the experimental data the run conditions i e h2 pressure influent no2 concentration and pd density were included as real list variables with calculation number as the argument in the parameter estimation function the unknown parameters were set active while the active calculations matched the experimental no2 concentrations to their respective calculation number variables the function requires minimum and maximum values for each unknown variable to be considered during numerous iterations minimizing œá2 both rate constants were bound between zero and one the effective hydrogel thickness was bound between zero and the average hydrogel thickness the diffusivity ratio was bound between zero and one and both diffusivities were bound in a range of one half to two times literature values while the parameter estimation minimized the total œá2 the resulting model fit one catalyst loading better than the other following the parameter estimation the rate constants and effective hydrogel thickness were manually adjusted by a trial and error approach by minimizing the residual sum of squares rss eq 4 4 rss i 1 n ob s i ca l i 2 where cal and obs are the calculated and observed values the model goodness of fit was determined by the coefficient of determination r 2 eq 5 5 r 2 rss i 1 n ob s i obs 2 where the accent bar represents the mean value this was calculated by comparing the calculated flux to the observed flux i e table si 1 2 4 model simulations the model simulated steady state behavior for a continuous flow chmr the model was used to evaluate the effect of the hydrogel catalyst density h2 supply pressure influent no2 and bulk concentration and hydrogel thickness on the no2 flux no2 reaction rate eq 3 and h2 and no2 concentration profiles the no2 flux j no2 g n m 2 d 1 was calculated using eq 6 6 j no 2 q in c inf c eff a where c inf is the influent no2 concentration mm and c eff mm is the steady state bulk concentration the flux represents the mass of no2 removed per day per area of hydrogel it is equal to the integral of the no2 reaction rate profile within the hydrogel i e integration with respect to position within the hydrogel 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration through the model calibration no2 diffusivity h2 diffusivity and the diffusivity ratio were estimated to be 3 8 10 9 m2 s 1 5 5 10 9 m2 s 1 and 0 97 respectively using the aquasim parameter estimation the k 1 k 2 and effective hydrogel thickness variables were initially estimated to be 0 0032 m3 mole pd 1 s 1 0 012 mole h2 m3 1 2 mole pd 1 s 1 and 106 Œºm respectively to further improve the fit these parameters were then manually adjusted to 0 0039 m3 mole pd 1 s 1 0 027 mole h2 m3 1 2 mole pd 1 s 1 and 100 Œºm respectively the model was used to calculate theoretical fluxes that were compared to the experimentally calculated fluxes for the conditions tested fig 3 table si 1 overall the model prediction was very good with a minimal rss 9 9 eq 4 and an r2 0 96 eq 5 but there were some points that did not lie on their respective model curves there are a few potential reasons for this deviation first for simplicity the model assumes that n2 is the sole byproduct with no nh4 formation however the selectivity to n2 and nh4 shifts with changing h2 and no2 concentrations within the hydrogel marks et al 2020 marks et al 2019 this change in the stoichiometry would alter the reduction rates and thus flux second the data is based on single experimental runs and thus there is no statistical error reported there is presumably some experimental variability especially at the lower h2 partial pressure and influent no2 experiments where the rates and conversion were low i e bottom curve in fig 3b as predicted by the model increasing the pd density resulted in higher fluxes generally increasing the available h2 or no2 increases the flux but at lower h2 supply pressures 0 3 atm the reaction became h2 limited such that increasing the available no2 did not increase the flux this was more severe for the lower pd density the flux is related to the sum of the catalytic rates at each point in the hydrogel this is controlled by the available h2 and no2 which is controlled by their mass transport rate with the calibrated model the influence of these variables can be evaluated to explain what controls the no2 flux 3 2 effect of catalytic hydrogel thickness on flux due to the counter diffusional nature of the chmr where the reactants h2 and no2 diffuse from opposite sides into the hydrogel the hydrogel thickness can have a significant impact on the no2 flux fig 4 shows the no2 flux as a function of hydrogel thickness for various pd densities the influent flowrate influent no2 concentration and h2 supply pressure are constant a higher pd density results in increased flux for all conditions but for hydrogels above approximately 500 ¬µm increasing the pd density does not provide appreciable increases in flux this is due to the low availability of h2 and no2 at pd sites this affects the no2 reduction rate as explained below when the hydrogel thickness is large the concurrent reactant concentrations are low due to mass transport resistance in the hydrogel thus the flux is low however decreasing the hydrogel thickness does not guarantee increased flux if the hydrogel is too thin the available pd active sites becomes limiting for all pd densities tested the optimal flux occurs when the hydrogel thickness is between 30 and 150 ¬µm and the optimal thickness for peak flux decreases with increasing pd density as such some outer catalyst bearing layer is required and simply adding catalyst directly to the surface of the hfm will not provide efficient reaction conditions note the optimal thickness range will also change if the influent flow influent no2 and supplied h2 are changed given a set of conditions this model can be used to determine the optimal hydrogel thickness that can guide improved synthesis of the chmr the impact of hydrogel thickness of the flux can be explained by evaluating the h2 and no2 concentration and no2 reduction rate profiles within the hydrogel 3 3 effect of the hydrogel thickness and pd density on the no2 and h2 concentrations and no2 reduction rate in the hydrogel profile as described by eq 3 the no2 reduction rate is dependent on the concentrations of no2 h2 and pd density in the hydrogel thus this reaction only occurs in the catalytic hydrogel in regions where h2 and no2 are concurrent defined herein as the reactive zone rz in this region the flux of h2 and no2 are influenced by both fickian diffusion eq 2 and the no2 reduction rate eq 3 which are dependent on localized h2 and no2 concentrations transport of h2 or no2 in the catalytic hydrogel where the opposing reactant is not present is governed solely by diffusion and this region is termed herein as the non reactive zone nrz due to the counter diffusional nature of the chmr the hydrogel thickness impacts the concurrent h2 and no2 concentrations in the hydrogel this in turn affects the localized reaction rate at pd sites and thus flux fig 5 shows the h2 and no2 concentration and no2 reduction rate profiles for two hydrogel thicknesses thick 800 ¬µm and thin 50 ¬µm and two pd densities 200 and 10 mole pd m 3 hydrogel using the results from fig 4 the two thicknesses were chosen to represent a thinner hydrogel that is affected by the pd density and a thicker hydrogel that is less sensitive to pd density the influent flowrate influent no2 concentration and h2 supply pressure are constant and are the same as that in fig 4 for a thick hydrogel fig 5a and c fig si 2a the reactant concentration profiles are dominated by mass transport limitations h2 and no2 must diffuse far into the hydrogel before meeting at pd active sites for the low pd density fig 5a this results in a broad rz 500 Œºm with respect to the total thickness 800 Œºm and low h2 and no2 concentrations in the rz resulting in low no2 reduction rates for the high pd density fig 5c the no2 reduction rates are higher because there are more pd active sites but this causes the rz to become narrower 200 Œºm the flux is the sum of all the rates within the hydrogel i e the integral of the rz thus only insignificant increases in flux occur when increasing the pd density due to mass transfer limitations of the thicker hydrogel for example the flux for the 200 and 10 mole pd m 3 hydrogel densities are 0 674 and 0 668 gn m 2 d 1 or a 1 difference this confirms the results from fig 4 showing a convergence of the fluxes for the pd densities with increasing thickness thus for thick hydrogels much of the hydrogel is either no2 or h2 concentration limited i e the nrz and only a small portion of the pd is being used for thin hydrogels fig 5b and d fig si 2b h2 and no2 are present throughout the hydrogel layer and the rz encompasses the full hydrogel profile for all pd densities tested because all the pd in the hydrogel is being used increasing the pd density results in a higher no2 reduction rate throughout the hydrogel layer though for higher densities the reaction starts to become no2 limited closer to the hfm wall fig 5d fig si 2 increasing the pd density leads to noticeable increases in flux for example the flux for the 200 and 10 mole pd m 3 hydrogel densities is 4 94 and 0 965 gn m 2 d 1 respectively 3 4 effect of the no2 and h2 concentrations on the concentration and rate profiles one of the major benefits of the chmr over conventional three phase catalyst systems is the ability to control the h2 supply pressure to maintain an optimal rate and conversion in realistic operating situations the pd density will be relatively constant but the influent no2 concentration may have seasonal changes the h2 partial pressure can be easily adjusted to match fluctuating no2 concentrations further as seen in fig 5 the h2 and no2 concentrations can greatly impact the overall reaction rate fig 6 demonstrates four scenarios for combinations of low and high influent h2 and no2 concentrations the influent flowrate pd density and hydrogel thickness were constant a hydrogel thickness of 200 Œºm was chosen so the reactant profiles and changes in the no2 rate can be easily distinguished with reactant concentration changes when the influent no2 concentration 1 mm and h2 supply pressure 0 3 atm are relatively low the peak no2 reduction rate is low and the rz is narrow fig 6a this results in a flux of 1 96 gn m 2 d 1 if the influent no2 concentration increases to 5 mm with no change in the h2 supply pressure fig 6b then the h2 becomes limiting resulting in an rz that is shifted toward the hfm but because the available no2 is higher higher no2 reduction rates are achieved across a narrower rz resulting in a flux increase to 5 33 gn m 2 d 1 if the h2 supply pressure is increased to 4 0 atm to match the increasing influent no2 5 mm fig 6c then the rz broadens while maintaining a high peak no2 reduction rate this results again in a flux increase to 13 36 gn m 2 d 1 however a higher h2 supply pressure is not always better if the h2 remains at 4 0 atm but the influent no2 drops back down to 1 mm fig 6d then the rz is shifted toward the bulk while an increased flux is observed 1 96 to 4 17 gn m 2 d 1 there is still h2 remaining at the hydrogel bulk interface this results in wasted h2 and the excess h2 can diffuse into the bulk which may promote the growth of bacterial biofilms that use h2 as an electron donor substrate thus as depicted by the modeling results the ability to control the h2 feed pressure such that h2 remains optimal throughout the rz is an advantage of the chmr compared to other catalytic reactors 4 conclusions this study focused on development of a 1 d model to describe the chmr this model can be used to evaluate the overall contaminant removal rate i e flux the h2 and contaminant concentrations within the hydrogel and the contaminant removal rates within the hydrogel this model can be extended to any hydrogenation catalyst e g rh ru pd in or reactant e g nitrate bromate perchlorate trichloroethylene allowing for the input of different reaction expressions and reactor conditions the model can also be extended to other icmrs that comprise of a mixed gas compartment linked diffusively to a catalytic layer that is analogous to a biofilm to improve the chmr model for no2 or no3 hydrogenation we suggest incorporating the effects of ph on catalytic activity basic ph greatly inhibits the reaction and because oh is a reaction byproduct the reaction is naturally inhibited unless ph control is employed ebbesen et al 2011 matatov meytal et al 2003 co2 bubbling is a simple buffer that can prevent a ph increase and can be included in the model either in the hfm or hydrogel reactor compartment inclusion of o2 in the model is another possible improvement as o2 will react with h2 preferentially over pd catalysts forming h2o2 and h2o which may affect reaction kinetics if there is sufficient competition with no2 for active sites centi et al 2003 another critical aspect of no2 no3 hydrogenation is selectivity inclusion of nh4 formation in a model is likely not viable considering the current limited understanding of the reaction pathway hu et al 2018 future work developing this understanding for inclusion would greatly enhance the value of such a model as the ability of the system to maintain nh4 concentrations below regulated levels is critical for drinking water applications finally the model could be improved by including a wider range of reactant concentrations along with further validation of the model through experimental repetitions development of a two dimensional 2 d model will greatly enhance the capabilities of a model to properly predict chmr performance in real world conditions it would provide information about changes along the axial and latitudinal positions within the chmr this would allow for investigation of the development of h2 concentration gradients that occur when the hfm lumen is supplied with h2 in open or closed mode operation marks et al 2020 the benefits of periodic venting of the hfm lumen on h2 consumption efficiency while maintaining high catalytic activity have been demonstrated experimentally for chmrs and through modeling of membrane biofilm reactors perez calleja et al 2017 development of a 2 d model in a program such as comsol would allow for optimization of the venting procedure to maximize the critical venting parameters of vent period and interval

17577,organic fouling and inorganic scaling are the main hurdles for efficient operation of reverse osmosis ro technology in a wide range of applications this study demonstrates dual functionality surface modification of thin film composite tfc ro membranes to simultaneously impart anti scaling and anti fouling properties two different grafting approaches were adapted to functionalize the membrane surface with sulfonic groups i non specific grafting of vinyl sulfonic acid vsa via redox radical initiation polymerization and ii covalent bonding of hydroxylamide o sulfonic acid hosa to the native carboxylic groups of the polyamide layer via carbodiimide mediated reaction both approaches to graft sulfonic groups were effective in increasing surface wettability and negative charge density of the tfc ro membranes without significant alteration of water and salt permeabilities importantly we verified through surface elemental analysis that covalently bound hosa effectively covers the native carboxylic groups of the pa layer both the vsa and hosa membranes exhibited lower flux decline during silica scaling and organic alginate fouling relative to the control unmodified membrane demonstrating the unique versatility of sulfonic groups to endow the tfc ro membranes with dual functionality to resist scaling and fouling in particular the hosa membrane showed excellent physical cleaning efficiencies with water flux recoveries of 92 5 1 0 and 88 4 6 4 for silica scaling and alginate fouling respectively additional results from silica nucleation experiments and atomic force measurements provided insights into the mechanisms of improved resistance to silica scaling and organic fouling imparted by the surface functionalized sulfonic groups our study highlights the promise of controlled functionalization of sulfonic groups on the polyamide layer of tfc membranes to enhance the applications of ro technology in treatment and reuse of waters with high scaling and fouling potential graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction desalination of brackish and seawater is a promising strategy to augment freshwater production in water stressed areas elimelech and phillip 2011 fritzmann et al 2007 at present membrane based reverse osmosis ro technology is the state of the art in the desalination industry qin et al 2019 accounting for more than 60 of global desalination capacity frank et al 2019 shenvi et al 2015 recent technological advances in ro process design including installation of energy recovery devices and the use of more efficient pumps have drastically reduced the energy demand for brackish and seawater desalination ahmed et al 2019 elimelech and phillip 2011 however membrane fouling and scaling remain as critical challenges that limit the efficiency and water recovery of ro desalination ali et al 2004 bremere et al 2000 guan et al 2019 quay et al 2018 lee et al 2006 son et al 2018 therefore development of high performance ro membranes with anti fouling and anti scaling properties is of great significance to further advance membrane based desalination technologies silica is one of the most prevailing sparingly soluble inorganic species in brackish water limiting high water recovery in ro due to membrane scaling brady et al 2005 milne et al 2014 tong et al 2017 silica scaling control on the membrane surface often requires the use of strong chemicals such as hydrofluoric acid mccartney et al 2017 which increase operational costs and adversely impact the environment membrane surface properties including surface wettability charge and functionality are key factors governing the initial silica nucleation on the membrane surface lu and huang 2019 rathinam et al 2019 tong et al 2017 a recent study demonstrated that the initial silica scaling layer which is controlled by the interaction between silanol groups of dissolved silica species and membrane surface functional groups determines the overall extent of silica scaling and subsequent permeate flux decline in ro lu and huang 2019 other studies rathinam et al 2019 tong et al 2017 revealed that surface functional groups with positive charge attract negatively charged dissolved silica species thus accelerating silica scaling on the membrane surface solution chemistry also plays an important role in the evolution of the silica scaling layer notably studies have shown that polymerization of dissolved silica species on the membrane surface is accelerated in the presence of divalent cations notably ca2 and mg2 latour et al 2014 milne et al 2014 ning 2003 xie and gray 2017 organic fouling is another longstanding problem in membrane based desalination which requires frequent chemical cleaning and increases operation cost li and elimelech 2004 zhao et al 2019 as with scaling the initial stage of organic fouling of the thin film composite tfc ro membranes is mainly determined by the interaction between organic foulants and specific functional groups on the membrane surface for example it is widely accepted that the native carboxylic groups of the polyamide surface promote irreversible binding of organic foulants e g alginate through complexation with calcium ions in solution wang and waite 2009 lee and elimelech 2006 mi and elimelech 2010b such bridging or complexation between calcium ions organic foulant alginate and carboxylic groups of the polyamide layer has recently been verified at a molecular level through density functional theory dft calculations zhang et al 2018 in particular two alginate chains cross link via calcium ions developing an egg box structure which preferentially deposits on the polyamide membrane surface zhang et al 2018 a plethora of studies aimed at individually improving anti fouling or anti scaling property of tfc ro membranes an ro membrane with improved silica scaling resistance was fabricated by grafting polymer brushes that endow the membrane surface with tailored charge properties tong et al 2017 a typical strategy to improve the resistance to organic fouling involves increasing wettability of the tfc ro membrane via hydrophilic surface modification ma et al 2017 shafi et al 2017 wu et al 2015 in another study an anti fouling tfc ro membrane was developed using isophthaloyl chloride instead of the commonly used trimesoyl chloride during interfacial polymerization to decrease the carboxylic group density of the resulting polyamide layer mo et al 2012 however in practical ro operation both scaling and fouling occur simultaneously on the membrane surface hence membrane fabrication or surface modification to simultaneously control scaling and fouling would be highly beneficial for more efficient ro desalination in this study we demonstrate surface modification of commercial tfc ro membranes for imparting simultaneously anti scaling and anti fouling properties polyamide ro membrane is grafted with sulfonic groups to increase surface hydrophilicity and negative charge density while minimizing the influence of the native carboxylic groups surface properties of the functionalized membranes are related to their silica scaling and organic fouling behavior to elucidate the underlying fouling and scaling mechanisms our findings suggest that grafting sulfonic groups on the surface of tfc ro membranes while covering the native carboxylic groups of the polyamide layer provides an effective strategy to control both silica scaling and organic fouling 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals commercial thin film

experiments were performed on the bench scale ro system the feed solution for the silica scaling experiments was prepared by mixing 2 8 mm na2sio3 7 0 mm cacl2 3 5 mm mgcl2 and 35 mm nacl which simulated the composition of brackish groundwater at 75 recovery the amorphous silica saturation index of this solution is 1 5 at ph of 6 50 0 05 tong et al 2017 organic fouling experiments were

and combined silica organic fouling experiments comprised the following steps first a fresh membrane coupon was compacted with di water for 20 h under 31 71 bar 460 psi until a constant water flux was obtained then the feed tank was filled with the prepared feed solution and the scaling or fouling experiment was initiated at a crossflow velocity of 16 cm s 1 and temperature of 25 1 c water flux during the ro experiments was monitored using a digital flow meter optiflow 1000 humonics ca for 1400 min the initial water fluxes for the silica scaling organic fouling and combined silica organic fouling experiments were controlled at 48 2 45 2 and 45 2 l m 2 h 1 respectively by adjusting the applied hydraulic pressure the permeate was recycled back to the feed tank under recycling mode membrane physical cleaning was performed immediately after the silica scaling or organic fouling or the combined silica organic fouling runs by circulating di feedwater at a crossflow velocity of 32 cm s 1 for 10 min with four cycles for each cycle the cleaning solution was replaced with fresh di water following the cleaning the pure water flux was re evaluated at 27 6 bar 400 psi at a feed crossflow velocity of 16 cm s 1 at 25 2 6 silica nucleation rate measurements silica wafer sequentially coated with a 5 nm titanium layer 99 995 kurt j lesker jefferson hills usa and an 80 nm gold

following the approach developed by biolin scientific rathinam et al 2019b briefly the substrate surfaces were treated with uv ozone for 10 min and submerged in a 5 1 1 mixture of ultrapure di water 30 v v hydrogen peroxide and 25 v v ammonium hydroxide for 15 min at a temperature of 70 75 to remove possible organic contamination after surface cleaning the substates were rinsed with ultrapure di water and dried with nitrogen gas subsequently the surface cleaned substrates were immersed in 1 5 mm ethanol based solutions of 11 mercaptoundecanoic acid and sodium 2 mercaptoethanesulfonate for at least 24 h for surface functionalization with sulfonic and carboxylic groups respectively followed by rinsing with ethanol and drying with nitrogen gas silica nucleation on the activated surface was monitored by optical microscopy zeiss 10 objective u s a giuffre et al 2013 hamm et al 2014 the supersaturated solution for silica nucleation was prepared with tetramethyl orthosilicate as reported

solution ph to 5 0 to obtain dissolved silica monomers in the solution 2 7 adhesion force measurements interaction forces between the surface modified ro membranes and the model organic foulant alginate were estimated using atomic force microscopy afm li and elimelech 2004 the force measurements were performed with a carboxylate modified polystyrene particle diameter of 4 5 ¬µm probe functionalized on a silicon nitride cantilever novascan technologies inc usa the afm measurements were conducted in a fluid cell containing 1 mm nahco3 and 0 5 mm cacl2 solution which is identical to the ionic solution composition employed for the organic fouling experiments cantilever deflection versus separation distance data were collected in afm contact mode for the probe particle approaching and retracting from the membrane surfaces a model fused silica wafer was used to calibrate the cantilever deflection sensitivity and spring constant three types of membranes were then used for force measurements at five random locations at least 50 measurements were collected on five random locations of each membrane sample to minimize the inherent variability in the force data which is mainly attributed to the heterogeneity of the membrane surface only the retracting force data representing the maximum adhesion forces between the membrane surface and the particle probe were analyzed with nanoscope analysis software version 1 90 bruker corporation 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface characteristics of functionalized membranes surface elemental composition of the vsa and hosa modified membranes was investigated using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps to verify the successful grafting of sulfonic groups for all membranes carbon nitrogen and oxygen were the predominant surface elements fig s1 of the supporting information compared to the control membrane the peak intensity of carbon was weakened after grafting vsa and hosa while those of nitrogen oxygen and sulfur were amplified high resolution s2p xps spectrum of the control membrane reveals three main peaks at binding energies of 167 6 168 7 and 170 8 ev fig s1b which are ascribed to the formation of c s o x c x 2 to 4 167 5 171 5 ev groups from oxidized sulfur groups huang et al 2014 yang et al 2011 the s2p signal at 167 6 ev is originated from the polysulfone substrate noor et al 2018 while the other two peaks at 168 7 and 170 8 ev are likely relevant to some additives during the membrane fabrication process the deconvolution of s2p spectrum for the vsa grafted membrane displayed a peak at 168 1 ev fig s1c gomez gonzalez et al 2014 stemming from cso3 na of the vinyl sulfonic acid sodium salt after grafting the hosa onto the membrane surface two peaks at 167 8 and 169 0 ev were observed fig s1d corresponding to sulfone of the membrane substrate and sulfonic acid oso3 h groups respectively noor et al 2018 cai et al 2020 thus verifying the successful binding of hosa on the membrane surface the signal of c1s for the control membrane comprises four major components which are respectively ascribed to the sp2 ch cc 284 6 ev co 285 5 ev c o 287 9 ev and o c o 290 6 ev species fig 2 a tang et al 2009 vandelinder et al 2015 with the introduction of sulfonic groups the peak corresponding to the sp2 ch cc bonds shifted to higher binding energies of 284 7 ev and 284 8 ev for the vsa and hosa grafted membranes respectively fig 2b and 2c suggesting an increase of the relative portion of the cc ch groups as reported previously yang et al 2012 after grafting vsa onto the membrane surface a peak at 287 6 ev originating from the c s bond appears nasef et al 2000 high resolution c1s spectrum for the hosa grafted membrane showed the emergence of a shoulder at 286 2 ev corresponding to cn bond formed using edc coupling reaction fig 2b peng et al 2013 in contrast the xps peak at 290 6 ev associated with the o c o groups vanished indicating that the native carboxylic groups were effectively converted via covalent binding with hosa the control and modified membranes showed two main peaks of o1s spectra associated with o c o o c n at 531 ev and co at 532 3 ev fig 2d f do et al 2012 notably the peak intensity ascribed to o c o o c n decreased slightly for the vsa grafted membrane fig 2e relative to the control membrane fig 2d while such change was more significant for the hosa grafted membrane fig 2f this result indicates the distinct surface chemistry of the tfc membranes modified by two different approaches non specific grafting of vsa on the membrane surface via redox radical initiation polymerization and covalent binding of hosa on the native carboxylic groups of polyamide layer thorough edcnhs coupling reaction delavari et al 2019 surface functionality of the vsa and hosa modified membranes was further investigated by attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy fig 3 a the peak intensity at 1150 cm 1 s o stretching in sulfonic groups zhao et al 2004 was enhanced for the vsa and hosa modified membranes compared to the control membrane further substantiating the successful surface grafting with sulfonic groups membrane surface wettability was evaluated by water contact angle measurements fig 3b water contact angles of both the vsa and hosa grafted membranes 31 and 28 respectively were smaller than the control membrane 40 suggesting increased hydrophilicity of the surfaces modified with sulfonic groups grafting sulfonic groups on the membrane surface provides abundant oxygen moieties that promote hydrogen bonds with water molecules thereby allowing the development of a strong hydration layer ayyaru and ahn 2017 and hence a lower contact angle lee and oh 2002 the zeta potentials of the membranes were determined from streaming potential measurements at a solution ph of 6 50 to investigate the charge characteristics of the sulfonic group modified surfaces lu et al 2013 as expected the control tfc ro membrane displays negative zeta potential 14 4 0 3 mv fig 3c due to the fixed negative charges of polyamide outer layer which stem from hydrolysis of unreacted acyl halides to carboxylic groups during membrane fabrication zhang et al 2019 after grafting the surfaces with sulfonic groups the vsa and hosa membranes exhibited a more negative surface charge with zeta potential values of 16 3 0 2 and 15 0 0 4 mv respectively sulfonic groups pk a 0 7 are much stronger acids than carboxylic groups pk a 4 2 because the electron density is more dispersed via resonance delocalization over three oxygen atoms hence sulfonic moieties confer higher polarity to the grafted surface than the corresponding carboxylic groups and thus increase the negative surface charge density of the vsa and hosa modified membranes ayyaru and ahn 2017 3 2 membrane transport properties the intrinsic ro membrane transport parameters of water permeability coefficient a salt permeability coefficient b and salt rejection were determined using a bench scale crossflow ro system water permeability of the control membrane increased slightly from 2 5 0 1 to 2 7 0 1 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 after surface modification with vsa while the hosa modified membrane exhibited a lower water permeability of 1 8 0 1 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 fig 4 the salt permeability coefficient b was calculated based on water flux and salt rejection evaluated with a 50 mm nacl feed solution at 27 6 bar 400 psi by accounting for the effect of concentration polarization at a cross flow velocity of 16 cm s 1 and a mass transport coefficient of 1 95 10 5 m s 1 68 3 3 l m 2 h 1 the average salt rejections of the vsa and hosa modified membranes 96 90 and 97 45 respectively are slightly higher than that of the control membrane 96 13 after accounting for the effect of concentration polarization the vsa and hosa modified membranes displayed salt permeability 0 46 0 05 and 0 42 0 01 l m 2 h 1 respectively comparable to that of the control membrane 0 32 0 07 l m 2 h 1 suggesting a negligible impact of sulfonic group surface modification on salt transport properties of the tfc ro membrane 3 3 silica scaling and alginate fouling behavior the dynamic scaling experiments were performed using a feed solution with an amorphous silica saturation index of 1 5 to allow direct comparison of the scaling behavior of the various membranes that possess different water and salt permeabilities identical hydrodynamic conditions of an initial water flux of 48 0 l m 2 h 1 and crossflow velocity at 16 0 cm s 1 were employed during all silica scaling runs as presented in fig 5 a all membranes experienced water flux decline over the experimental run as a consequence of silica scaling however the control membrane displays a steeper trend than the modified membranes resulting in a more significant flux decline of 22 relative to the initial flux of 48 0 l m 2 h 1 than those of the vsa 10 and hosa 5 membranes over the course of silica scaling we further tested the cleaning efficiency of the membranes to assess the influence of sulfonic groups on the reversibility of silica scaling at the end of the scaling runs di water was circulated at an increased crossflow velocity of 32 cm s 1 to enhance hydrodynamic shear on the membrane surface as shown in fig 5b the water flux recovery is higher for the modified membranes 90 6 3 8 and 92 5 1 0 for the vsa and hosa modified membranes respectively compared to that of the control membrane 85 0 5 2 suggesting that the scaling layer developed on the sulfonic group functionalized surfaces is more easily disrupted by physical cleaning both the vsa and hosa modified membranes exhibit lower flux decline and greater cleaning efficiency than the control membrane suggesting that surface functionalized sulfonic groups improve resistance to silica scaling the vsa and hosa functionalized membranes also showed an enhanced resistance to organic fouling by alginate as evidenced by the lower flux decline fig 5c although not to the same extent as shown for silica we further observed higher water flux recovery after physical hydrodynamic cleaning fig 5d following the alginate fouling experiments the relevant mechanisms responsible for the enhanced resistance of the sulfonic group modified ro membranes to silica scaling and organic fouling are discussed in the following subsection 3 4 proposed mechanisms of reduced silica scaling and alginate fouling heterogenous surface nucleation is the major mechanism responsible for the initial development of silica scaling layer mi and elimelech 2013 tong et al 2019 tong et al 2017 in this process dissolved silica species interact with carboxylic or hydroxyl functional groups to facilitate scale formation on the membrane surface mi and elimelech 2013 to trace silica nucleation we adapted an in situ imaging technique to quantify the number of nuclei formed on a substrate giuffre et al 2013 hamm et al 2014 a tetramethyl orthosilicate solution 5 mm with a supersaturation index of 2 6 for monomeric silica species was used to shorten the induction time for nucleation wallace et al 2009 for all the nucleation tests an identical flow rate of 30 ml h 1 was introduced to a substrate functionalized with either carboxylic or sulfonic groups the number of silica nuclei on the substrate as a function of time was monitored using an optical microscope as presented in fig 6 a the amount of silica nuclei observed on both substrates increased linearly with time however the nucleation rate which can be determined from the slope of the plot was much lower for the sulfonic group functionalized substrate than that for the carboxylic group functionalized substrate suggesting a lower tendency for the silica species to interact with the sulfonic groups than with the carboxylic groups schmidt et al 2010 tsai et al 2008 such reduced interactions likely lead to slower nucleation of silica on the membrane surface thereby resulting in the lower scaling propensity of the sulfonic group functionalized membranes i e vsa and hosa compared to the carboxylic group rich control membrane previous studies have proposed that the presence of divalent cations notably ca2 and mg2 facilitates silica polymerization on the membrane surface thereby accelerating the development of a silica scaling layer koo et al 2001 ning 2003 this enhanced silica polymerization is attributed to the formation of calcium or magnesium silicates guan et al 2019 by inspecting the silica fouled membranes via sem eds mapping fig s2 we observed that the surface of the control membrane contains a large silica covered area with uniform distribution of calcium and magnesium species while the presence of these species is more patchy and smaller on the sulfonic group functionalized membranes this result provides evidence that surface grafting of sulfonic groups could reduce scaling by hindering silica nucleation and deposition of silica aggregates on the membrane surface organic fouling at the early stage is largely determined by the interaction between foulants and the membrane surface for example calcium ions facilitate bridging and complexation between carboxyl groups on the polyamide surface and alginate molecules the gel network that consequently forms on the active layer could impede water flux mi and elimelech 2008 2010b we quantified the foulant membrane interaction via afm force measurements bowen et al 2002 hilal et al 2003 lee and elimelech 2006 li and elimelech 2004 liu et al 2017 mi and elimelech 2010b mo et al 2012 in fig 6b fmax rp represents the maximum adhesion force fmax normalized by the radius of a carboxyl cooh modified particle probe rp and is proportional to the energy per unit area required to detach the particle from the membrane surface israelachvili 2011 as such analysis of interaction forces enables us to better understand the initial stage organic fouling mechanisms li and elimelech 2004 as depicted in fig 6b an average adhesion force as high as 2 61 mn m was observed for the control membrane which we attribute to a strong bridging of the calcium ions in the solution with carboxylic groups on the membrane surface tiraferri et al 2012 in contrast the average adhesion force is shifted to a lower value of 2 52 and 1 81 mn m for the vsa and hosa membranes respectively indicating their weaker attractive interaction with the cooh rich particle probe these afm results are in accordance with the lower fouling propensity for the sulfonic group modified membranes i e the hosa and vsa membranes relative to the control membrane in the alginate fouling experiments the low adhesion forces evaluated for the hosa functionalized membrane are further corroborated by statistical analysis based on the quasi poisson law tiraferri et al 2012 specifically 54 of the adhesion forces of the hosa membrane are distributed in the attractive force range of 2 to 0 mn m which are even lower than the minimum adhesion force of the control membrane 2 mn m indicating much reduced sticky sites of the hosa functionalized membrane furthermore several afm contact events exhibit no measurable interaction note the no column in fig 6b further highlighting the organic fouling resistance of the hosa membrane several possible mechanisms are responsible for the different flux decline behaviors of the investigated three types of membranes during silica scaling especially for the hosa functionalized membrane previous studies have demonstrated that carboxylic groups on the polyamide membrane surface effectively form hydrogen bonds with oxygen containing groups of the dissolved silica species tsai et al 2008 the pristine polyamide active layer is relatively abundant in carboxylic groups that are prone to magnesium and calcium silicate complexation thus exhibiting the most severe flux decline during the silica scaling runs non specific grafting of vsa reduces the influence of the native carboxylic groups on the polyamide surface which improves resistance to silica scaling to some degree more notably hosa molecules that are covalently bound to the polyamide surface effectively eliminate the impact of carboxyl groups therefore imparting the hosa membrane with the most prominent anti scaling performance fig 5a the influence of sulfonic group modification on organic fouling was less prominent than silica scaling especially in long term operation organic fouling starts from the initial deposition of foulants on the surface followed by the evolution of the accumulated fouling layer with the latter stage playing a more dominant role in impeding water flux lee and elimelech 2006 li and elimelech 2004 notably calcium ions in the feed solution induce the formation of a dense egg box shape gel network through complexation with alginate molecules lee et al 2005 lee and elimelech 2006 therefore in long term operation feed solution chemistry plays a more important role in determining the extent of organic fouling than membrane surface functionality explaining the comparable flux declines for all types of membranes at the end of alginate fouling experiments fig 5c we note however that water flux decline behavior is not the sole measure for assessing the membrane antifouling property water flux recovery which is indicative of fouling reversibility is often regarded as a more valid parameter to assess membrane fouling resistance asatekin et al 2007 mo et al 2012 higher water flux recovery was observed for the vsa and hosa functionalized membranes compared with the unmodified control membrane fig 5d this observation further demonstrates the enhanced fouling resistance for the sulfonic group modified membranes 3 5 combined silica organic fouling behavior combined silica scaling organic fouling behavior of the sulfonic group modified ro membranes was examined with a mixture of silica and alginate both the vsa and hosa modified membranes exhibited enhanced fouling resistance as evidenced by their lower flux decline fig 7 a and higher flux recovery fig 7b relative to the control membrane comparison of the results from all the scaling fouling runs figs 5a 5c and 7a reveals that the extent of flux decline follows the order of alginate fouling combined silica organic fouling silica scaling this observation indicates that synergistic effects of combined silica organic fouling are not significant in accordance with the findings from our previous study that co existing organic matter has little effect on the interaction of silica species with surfaces guan et al 2019 as such no significant difference for the combined fouling layers formed on the sulfonic group modified membranes and the control membrane was observed in sem images fig s3 a similar phenomenon was also observed for the organic foulant layer nonetheless both sulfonic groups modified membranes showed slower flux declines than the control membrane especially during the early stage of the combined silica organic fouling experiments 300 min in fig 7a this phenomenon was likely related to the rapid development of the alginate fouling layer on the unmodified polyamide membrane surface with abundant carboxylic groups at the early fouling stage which consequently leads to the faster initial flux decline of the control ro membrane 4 concluding remarks in this study we demonstrated the successful grafting of sulfonic groups to tfc ro membranes using two different chemical modification strategies non specific grafting and covalent bonding ro membranes modified with the latter strategy exhibited obvious dual functionality in resisting both silica scaling and organic fouling we revealed that the presence of sulfonic groups increased the negative charge density and hydrophilicity of the membrane surface meanwhile reduced the impact of native carboxylic groups of the tfc polyamide layer thereby hampering the interactions of silica and organic foulants with the membrane notably the covalent binding of the sulfonic group effectively eliminated the impact of the native carboxylic groups in inducing bridging effects with foulants which further contributed to the enhanced fouling and silica scaling resistance membrane materials with such dual functionality may find applications in treating feedwaters with high scaling and fouling potential where circumventing feed water pretreatment and achieving high water recovery are desirable additionally our study revealed that the co existence of silica and organic foulants in the feed solution leads to fouling behavior that is different from that predicted based on single species fouling experiments highlights the need for investigations of membrane fouling under more complex and realistic conditions thereby effectively guiding the design of membrane materials and processes for real world applications

17577,organic fouling and inorganic scaling are the main hurdles for efficient operation of reverse osmosis ro technology in a wide range of applications this study demonstrates dual functionality surface modification of thin film composite tfc ro membranes to simultaneously impart anti scaling and anti fouling properties two different grafting approaches were adapted to functionalize the membrane surface with sulfonic groups i non specific grafting of vinyl sulfonic acid vsa via redox radical initiation polymerization and ii covalent bonding of hydroxylamide o sulfonic acid hosa to the native carboxylic groups of the polyamide layer via carbodiimide mediated reaction both approaches to graft sulfonic groups were effective in increasing surface wettability and negative charge density of the tfc ro membranes without significant alteration of water and salt permeabilities importantly we verified through surface elemental analysis that covalently bound hosa effectively covers the native carboxylic groups of the pa layer both the vsa and hosa membranes exhibited lower flux decline during silica scaling and organic alginate fouling relative to the control unmodified membrane demonstrating the unique versatility of sulfonic groups to endow the tfc ro membranes with dual functionality to resist scaling and fouling in particular the hosa membrane showed excellent physical cleaning efficiencies with water flux recoveries of 92 5 1 0 and 88 4 6 4 for silica scaling and alginate fouling respectively additional results from silica nucleation experiments and atomic force measurements provided insights into the mechanisms of improved resistance to silica scaling and organic fouling imparted by the surface functionalized sulfonic groups our study highlights the promise of controlled functionalization of sulfonic groups on the polyamide layer of tfc membranes to enhance the applications of ro technology in treatment and reuse of waters with high scaling and fouling potential graphical abstract image graphical abstract 1 introduction desalination of brackish and seawater is a promising strategy to augment freshwater production in water stressed areas elimelech and phillip 2011 fritzmann et al 2007 at present membrane based reverse osmosis ro technology is the state of the art in the desalination industry qin et al 2019 accounting for more than 60 of global desalination capacity frank et al 2019 shenvi et al 2015 recent technological advances in ro process design including installation of energy recovery devices and the use of more efficient pumps have drastically reduced the energy demand for brackish and seawater desalination ahmed et al 2019 elimelech and phillip 2011 however membrane fouling and scaling remain as critical challenges that limit the efficiency and water recovery of ro desalination ali et al 2004 bremere et al 2000 guan et al 2019 quay et al 2018 lee et al 2006 son et al 2018 therefore development of high performance ro membranes with anti fouling and anti scaling properties is of great significance to further advance membrane based desalination technologies silica is one of the most prevailing sparingly soluble inorganic species in brackish water limiting high water recovery in ro due to membrane scaling brady et al 2005 milne et al 2014 tong et al 2017 silica scaling control on the membrane surface often requires the use of strong chemicals such as hydrofluoric acid mccartney et al 2017 which increase operational costs and adversely impact the environment membrane surface properties including surface wettability charge and functionality are key factors governing the initial silica nucleation on the membrane surface lu and huang 2019 rathinam et al 2019 tong et al 2017 a recent study demonstrated that the initial silica scaling layer which is controlled by the interaction between silanol groups of dissolved silica species and membrane surface functional groups determines the overall extent of silica scaling and subsequent permeate flux decline in ro lu and huang 2019 other studies rathinam et al 2019 tong et al 2017 revealed that surface functional groups with positive charge attract negatively charged dissolved silica species thus accelerating silica scaling on the membrane surface solution chemistry also plays an important role in the evolution of the silica scaling layer notably studies have shown that polymerization of dissolved silica species on the membrane surface is accelerated in the presence of divalent cations notably ca2 and mg2 latour et al 2014 milne et al 2014 ning 2003 xie and gray 2017 organic fouling is another longstanding problem in membrane based desalination which requires frequent chemical cleaning and increases operation cost li and elimelech 2004 zhao et al 2019 as with scaling the initial stage of organic fouling of the thin film composite tfc ro membranes is mainly determined by the interaction between organic foulants and specific functional groups on the membrane surface for example it is widely accepted that the native carboxylic groups of the polyamide surface promote irreversible binding of organic foulants e g alginate through complexation with calcium ions in solution wang and waite 2009 lee and elimelech 2006 mi and elimelech 2010b such bridging or complexation between calcium ions organic foulant alginate and carboxylic groups of the polyamide layer has recently been verified at a molecular level through density functional theory dft calculations zhang et al 2018 in particular two alginate chains cross link via calcium ions developing an egg box structure which preferentially deposits on the polyamide membrane surface zhang et al 2018 a plethora of studies aimed at individually improving anti fouling or anti scaling property of tfc ro membranes an ro membrane with improved silica scaling resistance was fabricated by grafting polymer brushes that endow the membrane surface with tailored charge properties tong et al 2017 a typical strategy to improve the resistance to organic fouling involves increasing wettability of the tfc ro membrane via hydrophilic surface modification ma et al 2017 shafi et al 2017 wu et al 2015 in another study an anti fouling tfc ro membrane was developed using isophthaloyl chloride instead of the commonly used trimesoyl chloride during interfacial polymerization to decrease the carboxylic group density of the resulting polyamide layer mo et al 2012 however in practical ro operation both scaling and fouling occur simultaneously on the membrane surface hence membrane fabrication or surface modification to simultaneously control scaling and fouling would be highly beneficial for more efficient ro desalination in this study we demonstrate surface modification of commercial tfc ro membranes for imparting simultaneously anti scaling and anti fouling properties polyamide ro membrane is grafted with sulfonic groups to increase surface hydrophilicity and negative charge density while minimizing the influence of the native carboxylic groups surface properties of the functionalized membranes are related to their silica scaling and organic fouling behavior to elucidate the underlying fouling and scaling mechanisms our findings suggest that grafting sulfonic groups on the surface of tfc ro membranes while covering the native carboxylic groups of the polyamide layer provides an effective strategy to control both silica scaling and organic fouling 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemicals commercial thin film

stored in di water at 4 c before surface modification redox radical initiation and edc nhs coupling reaction were employed to graft vsa and hosa on the membrane surface respectively as illustrated in

and combined silica organic fouling experiments comprised the following steps first a fresh membrane coupon was compacted with di water for 20 h under 31 71 bar 460 psi until a constant water flux was obtained then the feed tank was filled with the prepared feed solution and the scaling or fouling experiment was initiated at a crossflow velocity of 16 cm s 1 and temperature of 25 1 c water flux during the ro experiments was monitored using a digital flow meter optiflow 1000 humonics ca for 1400 min the initial water fluxes for the silica scaling organic fouling and combined silica organic

following the approach developed by biolin scientific rathinam et al 2019b briefly the substrate surfaces were treated with uv ozone for 10 min and submerged in a 5 1 1 mixture of ultrapure di water 30 v v hydrogen peroxide and 25 v v ammonium hydroxide for 15 min at a temperature of 70 75 to remove possible organic contamination after surface cleaning the substates were rinsed with ultrapure di

alginate were estimated using atomic force microscopy afm li and elimelech 2004 the force measurements were performed with a carboxylate modified polystyrene particle diameter of 4 5 ¬µm probe functionalized on a silicon nitride cantilever novascan technologies inc usa the afm measurements were conducted in a fluid cell containing 1 mm nahco3 and 0 5 mm cacl2 solution which is identical to the ionic solution composition employed for the organic fouling experiments cantilever deflection versus separation distance data were collected in afm contact mode for the probe particle approaching and retracting from the membrane surfaces a model fused silica wafer was used to calibrate the cantilever deflection sensitivity and spring constant three types of membranes were then used for force measurements at five random locations at least 50 measurements were collected on five random locations of each membrane sample to minimize the inherent variability in the force data which is mainly attributed to the heterogeneity of the membrane surface only the retracting force data representing the maximum adhesion forces between the membrane surface and the particle probe were analyzed with nanoscope analysis software version 1 90 bruker corporation 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface characteristics of functionalized membranes surface elemental composition of the vsa and hosa modified membranes was investigated using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps to verify the successful grafting of sulfonic groups for all membranes carbon nitrogen and oxygen were the predominant surface elements fig s1 of the supporting information compared to the control membrane the peak intensity of carbon was weakened after grafting vsa and hosa while those of nitrogen oxygen and sulfur were amplified high resolution s2p xps spectrum of the control membrane reveals three main peaks at binding energies of 167 6 168 7 and 170 8 ev fig s1b which are ascribed to the formation of c s o x c x 2 to 4 167 5 171 5 ev groups from oxidized sulfur groups huang et al 2014 yang et al 2011 the s2p signal at 167 6 ev is originated from the polysulfone substrate noor et al 2018 while the other two peaks at 168 7 and 170 8 ev are likely relevant to some additives during the membrane fabrication process the deconvolution of s2p spectrum for the vsa grafted membrane displayed a peak at 168 1 ev fig s1c gomez gonzalez et al 2014 stemming from cso3 na of the vinyl sulfonic acid sodium salt after grafting the hosa onto the membrane surface two peaks at 167 8 and 169 0 ev were observed fig s1d corresponding to sulfone of the membrane substrate and sulfonic acid oso3 h groups respectively noor et al 2018 cai et al 2020 thus verifying the successful binding of hosa on the membrane surface the signal of c1s for the control membrane comprises four major components which are respectively ascribed to the sp2 ch cc 284 6 ev co 285 5 ev c o 287 9 ev and o c o 290 6 ev species fig 2 a tang et al 2009 vandelinder et al 2015 with the introduction of sulfonic groups the peak corresponding to the sp2 ch cc bonds shifted to higher binding energies of 284 7 ev and 284 8 ev for the vsa and hosa grafted membranes respectively fig 2b and 2c suggesting an increase of the relative portion of the cc ch groups as reported previously yang et al 2012 after grafting vsa onto the membrane surface a peak at 287 6 ev originating from the c s bond appears nasef et al 2000 high resolution c1s spectrum for the hosa grafted membrane showed the emergence of a shoulder at 286 2 ev corresponding to cn bond formed using edc coupling reaction fig 2b peng et al 2013 in contrast the xps peak at 290 6 ev associated with the o c o groups vanished indicating that the native carboxylic groups were effectively converted via covalent binding with hosa the control and modified membranes showed two main peaks of o1s spectra associated with o c o o c n at 531 ev and co at 532 3 ev fig 2d f do et al 2012 notably the peak intensity ascribed to o c o o c n decreased slightly for the vsa grafted membrane fig 2e relative to the control membrane fig 2d while such change was more significant for the hosa grafted membrane fig 2f this result indicates the distinct surface chemistry of the tfc membranes modified by two different approaches non specific grafting of vsa on the membrane surface via redox radical initiation polymerization and covalent binding of hosa on the native carboxylic groups of polyamide layer thorough edcnhs coupling reaction delavari et al 2019 surface functionality of the vsa and hosa modified membranes was further investigated by attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy fig 3 a the peak intensity at 1150 cm 1 s o stretching in sulfonic groups zhao et al 2004 was enhanced for the vsa and hosa modified membranes compared to the control membrane further substantiating the successful surface grafting with sulfonic groups membrane surface wettability was evaluated by water contact angle measurements fig 3b water contact angles of both the vsa and hosa grafted membranes 31 and 28 respectively were smaller than the control membrane 40 suggesting increased hydrophilicity of the surfaces modified with sulfonic groups grafting sulfonic groups on the membrane surface provides abundant oxygen moieties that promote hydrogen bonds with water molecules thereby allowing the development of a strong hydration layer ayyaru and ahn 2017 and hence a lower contact angle lee and oh 2002 the zeta potentials of the membranes were determined from streaming potential measurements at a solution ph of 6 50 to investigate the charge characteristics of the sulfonic group modified surfaces lu et al 2013 as expected the control tfc ro membrane displays negative zeta potential 14 4 0 3 mv fig 3c due to the fixed negative charges of polyamide outer layer which stem from hydrolysis of unreacted acyl halides to carboxylic groups during membrane fabrication zhang et al 2019 after grafting the surfaces with sulfonic groups the vsa and hosa membranes exhibited a more negative surface charge with zeta potential values of 16 3 0 2 and 15 0 0 4 mv respectively sulfonic groups pk a 0 7 are much stronger acids than carboxylic groups pk a 4 2 because the electron density is more dispersed via resonance delocalization over three oxygen atoms hence sulfonic moieties confer higher polarity to the grafted surface than the corresponding carboxylic groups and thus increase the negative surface charge density of the vsa and hosa modified membranes ayyaru and ahn 2017 3 2 membrane transport properties the intrinsic ro membrane transport parameters of water permeability coefficient a salt permeability coefficient b and salt rejection were determined using a bench scale crossflow ro system water permeability of the control membrane increased slightly from 2 5 0 1 to 2 7 0 1 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 after surface modification with vsa while the hosa modified membrane exhibited a lower water permeability of 1 8 0 1 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 fig 4 the salt permeability coefficient b was calculated based on water flux and salt rejection evaluated with a 50 mm nacl feed solution at 27 6 bar 400 psi by accounting for the effect of concentration polarization at a cross flow velocity of 16 cm s 1 and a mass transport coefficient of 1 95 10 5 m s 1 68 3 3 l m 2 h 1 the average salt rejections of the vsa and hosa modified membranes 96 90 and 97 45 respectively are slightly higher than that of the control membrane 96 13 after accounting for the effect of concentration polarization the vsa and hosa modified membranes displayed salt permeability 0 46 0 05 and 0 42 0 01 l m 2 h 1 respectively comparable to that of the control membrane 0 32 0 07 l m 2 h 1 suggesting a negligible impact of sulfonic group surface modification on salt transport properties of the tfc ro membrane 3 3 silica scaling and alginate fouling behavior the dynamic scaling experiments were performed using a feed solution with an amorphous silica saturation index of 1 5 to allow direct comparison of the scaling behavior of the various membranes that possess different water and salt permeabilities identical hydrodynamic conditions of an initial water flux of 48 0 l m 2 h 1 and crossflow velocity at 16 0 cm s 1 were employed during all silica scaling runs as presented in fig 5 a all membranes experienced water flux decline over the experimental run as a consequence of silica scaling however the control membrane displays a steeper trend than the modified membranes resulting in a more significant flux decline of 22 relative to the initial flux of 48 0 l m 2 h 1 than those of the vsa 10 and hosa 5 membranes over the course of silica scaling we further tested the cleaning efficiency of the membranes to assess the influence of sulfonic groups on the reversibility of silica scaling at the end of the scaling runs di water was circulated at an increased crossflow velocity of 32 cm s 1 to enhance hydrodynamic shear on the membrane surface as shown in fig 5b the water flux recovery is higher for the modified membranes 90 6 3 8 and 92 5 1 0 for the vsa and hosa modified membranes respectively compared to that of the control membrane 85 0 5 2 suggesting that the scaling layer developed on the sulfonic group functionalized surfaces is more easily disrupted by physical cleaning both the vsa and hosa modified membranes exhibit lower flux decline and greater cleaning efficiency than the control membrane suggesting that surface functionalized sulfonic groups improve resistance to silica scaling the vsa and hosa functionalized membranes also showed an enhanced resistance to organic fouling by alginate as evidenced by the lower flux decline fig 5c although not to the same extent as shown for silica we further observed higher water flux recovery after physical hydrodynamic cleaning fig 5d following the alginate fouling experiments the relevant mechanisms responsible for the enhanced resistance of the sulfonic group modified ro membranes to silica scaling and organic fouling are discussed in the following subsection 3 4 proposed mechanisms of reduced silica scaling and alginate fouling heterogenous surface nucleation is the major mechanism responsible for the initial development of silica scaling layer mi and elimelech 2013 tong et al 2019 tong et al 2017 in this process dissolved silica species interact with carboxylic or hydroxyl functional groups to facilitate scale formation on the membrane surface mi and elimelech 2013 to trace silica nucleation we adapted an in situ imaging technique to quantify the number of nuclei formed on a substrate giuffre et al 2013 hamm et al 2014 a tetramethyl orthosilicate solution 5 mm with a supersaturation index of 2 6 for monomeric silica species was used to shorten the induction time for nucleation wallace et al 2009 for all the nucleation tests an identical flow rate of 30 ml h 1 was introduced to a substrate functionalized with either carboxylic or sulfonic groups the number of silica nuclei on the substrate as a function of time was monitored using an optical microscope as presented in fig 6 a the amount of silica nuclei observed on both substrates increased linearly with time however the nucleation rate which can be determined from the slope of the plot was much lower for the sulfonic group functionalized substrate than that for the carboxylic group functionalized substrate suggesting a lower tendency for the silica species to interact with the sulfonic groups than with the carboxylic groups schmidt et al 2010 tsai et al 2008 such reduced interactions likely lead to slower nucleation of silica on the membrane surface thereby resulting in the lower scaling propensity of the sulfonic group functionalized membranes i e vsa and hosa compared to the carboxylic group rich control membrane previous studies have proposed that the presence of divalent cations notably ca2 and mg2 facilitates silica polymerization on the membrane surface thereby accelerating the development of a silica scaling layer koo et al 2001 ning 2003 this enhanced silica polymerization is attributed to the formation of calcium or magnesium silicates guan et al 2019 by inspecting the silica fouled membranes via sem eds mapping fig s2 we observed that the surface of the control membrane contains a large silica covered area with uniform distribution of calcium and magnesium species while the presence of these species is more patchy and smaller on the sulfonic group functionalized membranes this result provides evidence that surface grafting of sulfonic groups could reduce scaling by hindering silica nucleation and deposition of silica aggregates on the membrane surface organic fouling at the early stage is largely determined by the interaction between foulants and the membrane surface for example calcium ions facilitate bridging and complexation between carboxyl groups on the polyamide surface and alginate molecules the gel network that consequently forms on the active layer could impede water flux mi and elimelech 2008 2010b we quantified the foulant membrane interaction via afm force measurements bowen et al 2002 hilal et al 2003 lee and elimelech 2006 li and elimelech 2004 liu et al 2017 mi and elimelech 2010b mo et al 2012 in fig 6b fmax rp represents the maximum adhesion force fmax normalized by the radius of a carboxyl cooh modified particle probe rp and is proportional to the energy per unit area required to detach the particle from the membrane surface israelachvili 2011 as such analysis of interaction forces enables us to better understand the initial stage organic fouling mechanisms li and elimelech 2004 as depicted in fig 6b an average adhesion force as high as 2 61 mn m was observed for the control membrane which we attribute to a strong bridging of the calcium ions in the solution with carboxylic groups on the membrane surface tiraferri et al 2012 in contrast the average adhesion force is shifted to a lower value of 2 52 and 1 81 mn m for the vsa and hosa membranes respectively indicating their weaker attractive interaction with the cooh rich particle probe these afm results are in accordance with the lower fouling propensity for the sulfonic group modified membranes i e the hosa and vsa membranes relative to the control membrane in the alginate fouling experiments the low adhesion forces evaluated for the hosa functionalized membrane are further corroborated by statistical analysis based on the quasi poisson law tiraferri et al 2012 specifically 54 of the adhesion forces of the hosa membrane are distributed in the attractive force range of 2 to 0 mn m which are even lower than the minimum adhesion force of the control membrane 2 mn m indicating much reduced sticky sites of the hosa functionalized membrane furthermore several afm contact events exhibit no measurable interaction note the no column in fig 6b further highlighting the organic fouling resistance of the hosa membrane several possible mechanisms are responsible for the different flux decline behaviors of the investigated three types of membranes during silica scaling especially for the hosa functionalized membrane previous studies have demonstrated that carboxylic groups on the polyamide membrane surface effectively form hydrogen bonds with oxygen containing groups of the dissolved silica species tsai et al 2008 the pristine polyamide active layer is relatively abundant in carboxylic groups that are prone to magnesium and calcium silicate complexation thus exhibiting the most severe flux decline during the silica scaling runs non specific grafting of vsa reduces the influence of the native carboxylic groups on the polyamide surface which improves resistance to silica scaling to some degree more notably hosa molecules that are covalently bound to the polyamide surface effectively eliminate the impact of carboxyl groups therefore imparting the hosa membrane with the most prominent anti scaling performance fig 5a the influence of sulfonic group modification on organic fouling was less prominent than silica scaling especially in long term operation organic fouling starts from the initial deposition of foulants on the surface followed by the evolution of the accumulated fouling layer with the latter stage playing a more dominant role in impeding water flux lee and elimelech 2006 li and elimelech 2004 notably calcium ions in the feed solution induce the formation of a dense egg box shape gel network through complexation with alginate molecules lee et al 2005 lee and elimelech 2006 therefore in long term operation feed solution chemistry plays a more important role in determining the extent of organic fouling than membrane surface functionality explaining the comparable flux declines for all types of membranes at the end of alginate fouling experiments fig 5c we note however that water flux decline behavior is not the sole measure for assessing the membrane antifouling property water flux recovery which is indicative of fouling reversibility is often regarded as a more valid parameter to assess membrane fouling resistance asatekin et al 2007 mo et al 2012 higher water flux recovery was observed for the vsa and hosa functionalized membranes compared with the unmodified control membrane fig 5d this observation further demonstrates the enhanced fouling resistance for the sulfonic group modified membranes 3 5 combined silica organic fouling behavior combined silica scaling organic fouling behavior of the sulfonic group modified ro membranes was examined with a mixture of silica and alginate both the vsa and hosa modified membranes exhibited enhanced fouling resistance as evidenced by their lower flux decline fig 7 a and higher flux recovery fig 7b relative to the control membrane comparison of the results from all the scaling fouling runs figs 5a 5c and 7a reveals that the extent of flux decline follows the order of alginate fouling combined silica organic fouling silica scaling this observation indicates that synergistic effects of combined silica organic fouling are not significant in accordance with the findings from our previous study that co existing organic matter has little effect on the interaction of silica species with surfaces guan et al 2019 as such no significant difference for the combined fouling layers formed on the sulfonic group modified membranes and the control membrane was observed in sem images fig s3 a similar phenomenon was also observed for the organic foulant layer nonetheless both sulfonic groups modified membranes showed slower flux declines than the control membrane especially during the early stage of the combined silica organic fouling experiments 300 min in fig 7a this phenomenon was likely related to the rapid development of the alginate fouling layer on the unmodified polyamide membrane surface with abundant carboxylic groups at the early fouling stage which consequently leads to the faster initial flux decline of the control ro membrane 4 concluding remarks in this study we demonstrated the successful grafting of sulfonic groups to tfc ro membranes using two different chemical modification strategies non specific grafting and covalent bonding ro membranes modified with the latter strategy exhibited obvious dual functionality in resisting both silica scaling and organic fouling we revealed that the presence of sulfonic groups increased the negative charge density and hydrophilicity of the membrane surface meanwhile reduced the impact of native carboxylic groups of the tfc polyamide layer thereby hampering the interactions of silica and organic foulants with the membrane notably the covalent binding of the sulfonic group effectively eliminated the impact of the native carboxylic groups in inducing bridging effects with foulants which further contributed to the enhanced fouling and silica scaling resistance membrane materials with such dual functionality may find applications in treating feedwaters with high scaling and fouling potential where circumventing feed water pretreatment and achieving high water recovery are desirable additionally our study revealed that the co existence of silica and organic foulants in the feed solution leads to fouling behavior that is different from that predicted based on single species fouling experiments highlights the need for investigations of membrane fouling under more complex and realistic conditions thereby effectively guiding the design of membrane materials and processes for real world applications

melanin formation and pigmentation in many organisms ito and wakamatsu 2008 no study has analyzed both the ecotoxicity and benefit i e tyrosinase inhibition potency of bp type uv filters this study aimed to establish a structured in vitro and in vivo toxicity activity ranking system for the 7 commonly used bps then evaluate their ecotoxicity and tyrosinase inhibition potential to screen for less toxic bps with more benefit a series of specific in vitro cellular bioassays was used for assessing endocrine disrupting potency and genotoxicity of the 7 bps as well as their tyrosinase inhibition activity in mushroom extracts early life stages of medaka fish oryzias latipes a freshwater teleost species native to rice paddies of asia was used as an in vivo toxicity model for assessing the lethal and sublethal toxic effects of tested bps zebrafish danio rerio is an ideal animal model for studying in vivo melanogenesis because it has a high amount of melanin and conservative pathways in melanogenesis similar to humans fukamachi et al 2001 hishida et al 1961 both fish species are cost effective and sensitive small vertebrate models commonly used in basic biology medical and

exposure for acclimation then erm solution was replaced with exposure solutions of 7 bps 1 50 Œºm the selection of the tested concentration range was based on 3 4 runs of range finding tests for each bp data not shown the larval mortality was recorded at 24 48 72 and 96 hr after exposure the dosing solutions were not renewed during fish exposure as static test was performed fish were sufficiently fed during acclimation but not during exposure 2 4 locomotion analysis of bp treated medaka larvae free swimming larvae 7 dph were randomly assigned to 24 well microplates one per well containing erm

mushroom tyrosinase inhibition was performed as described abbas et al 2017 with minor modifications briefly different bp solutions 10 50 Œºm were added into 96 well microplates containing phosphate buffer 20 mm ph 6 8 mushroom tyrosinase 30 u ml and l dopa 0 85 mm and incubated at 37 c for 30 min dopachrome formation was measured at 475 nm to calculate the percentage inhibition of tyrosinase activity 2 9 in vivo tyrosinase inhibition potential and melanin content in zebrafish more than 50 synchronized embryos of zebrafish were exposed to bp 2 10 30 ¬µm and 2 well known melanogenic

duncan test data for locomotor activities and non normally distributed data were analyzed with the non parametric kruskal wallis test statistical significance was set at p 0 05 statistical analysis of experimental data involved using spss 25 spss inc chicago il 3 results 3 1 acute mortality of 7 bps on medaka larvae fig s1 shows the acute mortalities of the 7 tested bps with 96 hr exposure recorded at 24 hr intervals for any change in larval mortality of note no larval death was observed in the blank control and for all tested concentrations of bp 2 after 24 hr of exposure and bp 2 started to cause fish mortality after 48 hr fig s1b however the other 6 bps showed a dose and time dependent increase in larval mortality from 24 hr to 96 hr exposure fig s1 table 1 lists the lc50 values for the 7 bps in medaka larvae at different times based on the results of fig s1 the lc50 values decreased with exposure time but the toxicity ranking of tested bps was similar at any time point in terms of the 96 hr lc50 bp 2 was the least lethal to medaka larvae followed by bp 4 bp 7 bp 3 bp 6 and bp 1 bp 8 was the most lethal 3 2 the effect of bps on medaka larval locomotion three bps bp 2 bp 3 and bp 8 were further evaluated for their potency on altering larval locomotion after 24 hr 48 hr and 7 day exposure table s7 fig s2 s10 bp 2 and bp 8 were selected as the least and most toxic bps from 96 hr acute mortality tests and bp 3 is the most commonly used bps with much toxic evidence for further comparisons with 24 hr exposure all 3 tested bps did not significantly alter larval locomotion at most of the tested parameters and concentrations except bp 3 altered the maximum velocity of medaka larvae at 50 nm and bp 8 altered both the maximum velocity and relative turn angles at 20 nm fig s2 s4 after 48 hr exposure bp 2 and bp 3 significantly induced only one parameter of larval locomotion at the highest tested concentration the percentage time active and absolute turn angle respectively fig s5 s6 however bp 8 had already caused significant changes in 3 parameters of larval locomotion mean velocity maximum velocity and percentage time active at 50 nm fig s7 with 7 day exposure both bp 2 10 nm and bp 3 5 nm evoked hypoactivity as shown by the decreasing trend of the percentage time active for medaka exposed to each compound relative to the control groups fig s s8c s9c however bp 8 at 5 to 50 nm had caused significant alterations in 4 of 5 parameters of larval locomotion with the exception of relative turn angle fig s10 this result indicated that bp 2 was the least toxic at environmentally relevant concentrations followed by bp 3 and lastly bp 8 based on their lowest observed effective concentrations loec summarized in table s7 3 3 ros mediated oxidative stress responses from sublethal exposure to bp 2 bp 3 and bp 8 ros production and activities of antioxidants cat sod gst and gr in medaka larvae were determined after 7 day exposure to bp 2 bp 3 and bp 8 5 to 50 nm fig 1 none of the 3 selected bps significantly induced ros levels in larvae after the exposure period fig 1a all 3 tested bps induced a minor alteration 0 2 to 2 fold change vs the control in antioxidant activities fig 1b e cat activity was significantly increased by bp 2 at 10 and 50 nm and by bp 8 at 50 nm whereas bp 3 decreased cat activity at 50 nm fig 1b the activities of sod gst and gr at most time points and concentrations did not differ significantly from the control level for all 3 bps except bp 8 decreased gst level at 20 nm fig 1d bp 3 significantly decreased gr level at 5 and 20 nm and bp 8 decreased gr level at 20 nm fig 1e 3 4 in vitro toxicity screening of 7 bps fig s11 shows differential dose dependent endocrine disrupting activities in estrogenic anti estrogenic androgenic anti androgenic progestogenic and anti progestogenic activities among the 7 bps from a series of yeast based reporter assays bp 1 showed the strongest estrogenic and anti estrogenic activities followed by bp 2 then the remaining bps fig s11a b all tested bps had no androgenic or progestogenic activities fig s11c and s11e whereas most showed weak anti androgenic or anti progestogenic activities except for bp 1 both bp 2 and bp 4 did not induce significant changes in anti androgenic activities or anti progestogenic activities as compared to the control fig s11e f furthermore all 7 bps did not induce significant genotoxic potency with the rec assay fig s12 from the ec50 ic50 values from the concentration activity curves for the 7 tested bps table 2 bp 1 had highest estrogenic activities and weak anti androgenic activity bp 2 and bp 6 had less and the least estrogenic activities and bp 3 bp 6 bp 7 and bp 8 had both weak anti androgenic and anti progestogenic activities bp 8 also induced weak anti estrogenic activity but bp 4 did not show any endocrine disrupting activity 3 5 the effect of bps bp 1 bp 2 bp 3 and bp 8 on the induction of estrogenic related vitellogenesis in liver of male medaka because bp 1 bp 2 and bp 3 induced significant er based estrogenic activities in in vitro bioassays we further confirmed their ability to induce hepatic estrogenic marker genes including vtg1 vtg2 er Œ± and chg by qpcr with male medaka after 12 day exposure fig 2 normally male fish do not need to produce eggs so the hepatic mrna level of these estrogenic marker genes was low in the blank control groups however the presence of female estrogen e2 could significantly enhance the expression of e2 signaling genes such as er Œ± vtg and chg fig 2 all 4 tested bps significantly upregulated the expression of the vitellogenin encoding genes vtg1 and vtg2 dose dependently at 250 ¬µm bp 1 and bp 3 markedly increased the transcription of both genes and at 500 ¬µm these 2 compounds had upregulated vtg1 and vtg2 by 8000x relative to the control with the exception of bp 3 at 500 ¬µm only a slight increase was observed for er Œ± expression in livers exposed to bp 1 bp 2 and bp 8 regarded as a sensitive biomarker for estrogenic pollutants chg encodes the precursor of inner layer subunits of the egg envelope chen et al 2008 three bps bp 1 bp 3 and bp 8 at both tested concentrations significantly upregulated the expression of chg so these compounds significantly induced estrogenic activity in male medaka after 12 days of exposure 3 6 in vitro mushroom tyrosinase inhibition potency of 7 bps fig 3 a shows a promising dose dependent increase in mushroom tyrosinase activity evoked by bp 2 with an ic50 value of 19 7 ¬µm table 1 bp 2 was already able to inhibit mushroom tyrosinase activity by 16 at 10 ¬µm and approximately 70 of activity at 50 ¬µm relative to kojic acid fig 3a six of the 7 selected bp compounds with the exception of bp 2 showed no significant inhibition of mushroom tyrosinase activity with higher ic50 values than the highest tested concentration of 50 ¬µm table 2 3 7 melanogenesis inhibition potential of bp 2 in zebrafish bp 2 was the only uv filter with potent ability to inhibit mushroom tyrosinase activity from initial screening with the in vitro mushroom tyrosinase assay hence bp 2 was selected for further in vivo validation of its melanogenesis inhibition potential in zebrafish fig 3b shows the phenotypic changes of bp 2 treatments 10 30 Œºm and positive controls on the pigmentation of zebrafish the blank control group showed significant melanin development especially in the eyes body and yolk sac whereas ptu 200 Œºm significantly decreased the pigmentation of zebrafish because the body color was significantly faded to almost white and transparent although not as significant as with ptu exposure bp 2 at different concentrations produced notable fading of pigments a significant decrease in melanin content was observed after treatment with increased concentrations of bp 2 fig 3c as expected of the positive control ptu remarkably decreased the total melanin content of exposed embryos by almost 80 kojic acid also decreased melanin content but to a lesser extent approximately 20 decrease as compared with ptu bp 2 decreased melanin content dose dependently decreased to 92 at the lowest tested concentration of 10 ¬µm when the concentration was increased melanin content of exposed zebrafish embryos significantly decreased at 20 and 30 ¬µm bp 2 treatment decreased melanin by 18 and 30 respectively the melanogenesis inhibition of bp 2 at 20 ¬µm was already comparable to that of kojic acid at 30 ¬µm so bp 2 may be a potential alternative to kojic acid a similar decreasing trend was observed for tyrosinase activity of bp 2 exposed zebrafish embryos fig 3c ptu remarkably decreased the activity of treated embryos by almost 60 whereas kojic acid decreased the activity by 20 bp 2 conferred a dose dependent inhibition of zebrafish tyrosinase activity the activity was decreased to 91 at the lowest tested concentration 10 ¬µm at 20 and 30 ¬µm bp 2 inhibited tyrosinase activity by 15 and 28 respectively bp 2 at 20 ¬µm was as potent as kojic acid at 30 ¬µm in tyrosinase inhibition of exposed zebrafish embryos however zebrafish embryos treated with bp 3 at 10 to 30 ¬µm did not show significant depigmentation fig s13 but showed significant toxicity acute mortality and malformation table s8 at the lowest tested concentration of 10 ¬µm approximately 22 of total exposed embryos showed development of yolk sac edema the proportion of zebrafish embryos with yolk sac edema increased with increasing concentration of bp 3 reaching 54 and 69 with 20 and 30 ¬µm respectively table s8 additionally the phenotypes of bp 3 treated embryos at 48 hpf showed pericardial edema and internal bleeding around the yolk and tail bending at 20 and 30 ¬µm fig s13b c bp 3 induced detrimental effects and developmental toxicities to exposed zebrafish embryos and was not further evaluated for its melanogenesis inhibition potential 4 discussion currently the eco toxicities of commercially available bps have not been comprehensively assessed in vitro and in vivo this current research systematically ranked the toxicity of 7 commercially available bps using sensitive in vivo biomarker assays with medaka fish and specific in vitro bioassays under lethal and sublethal exposures fig s14 bp 2 was identified as the least toxic among the 7 tested bps and at environmentally relevant concentrations bp 2 and bp 3 were further assessed for their melanogenesis inhibition potential because multifunctional uv filtering products could replace the use of more toxic bps such as bp 3 and bp 1 with the increasing awareness of the risk of uv overexposure from sunlight the market for bp containing sunscreen and other pcps has skyrocketed thereby increasing the rate of these bp compounds being washed into water bodies via direct input or daily discharge from wwtps bp 3 oxybenzone has been in the scientific spotlight for many years as one of the most popular choices of active ingredients in many commercial sunscreens it is frequently detected in wwtps and surface waters in countries in europe asia and america ranging from 5 ng l to 7 8 Œºg l in different aquifers table s4 and in 98 of human urine samples in a survey of the us population calafat et al 2008 bp 1 a metabolite of bp 3 is also frequently detected in environmental water samples although at smaller ranges 1 2 722 ng l table s4 although the environmental concentrations of these compounds are relatively low ng l to Œºg l bp type uv filters have become an environmental concern because of their high consumption by many industries persistency in the environment and reported toxic and estrogenic effects in wildlife and laboratory models table s2 s5 4 1 in vivo toxicity ranking of bps and ecotoxicity risks this study first ranked bp 2 as the least lethal followed by bp 4 bp 7 bp 3 bp 6 and bp 1 also based on 96 hr lc50 data bp 8 was the most lethal to medaka larvae table 1 our result is consistent with literature studies of acute toxic effects of bps on different model organisms as compared with bp 3 and bp 4 bp 8 showed relatively higher toxic effects on barnacle nauplius larvae after 24 hr exposure tsui et al 2019 second only to bp 4 bp 2 induced the least acute mortality among uv filters tested with daphnia magna and freshwater free living planaria found in taiwan known as dugesia japonica li 2012 liu et al 2015 however decades of toxicology studies have shown that acute lethality should not be the only endpoint for toxicity evaluation jirova et al 2016 as such we selected 3 bps bp 2 bp 3 and bp 8 for further sublethal toxicity evaluation with the use of sensitive biomarkers such as larval locomotion and oxidative stress responses with broader ranges of environmentally relevant concentrations the sublethal toxicity ranking for the 3 bps agreed with results from the acute toxicity test the extent of bp induced alterations in swimming behavior of medaka larvae after 7 day exposure to 3 bps agreed with the acute mortality results bp 2 was the least toxic followed by bp 3 and lastly bp 8 based on ranking of their loecs table s7 bp 2 10 nm and bp 3 5 nm only decreased the percentage time active hypoactivity of medaka larvae whereas bp 8 at 5 to 50 nm caused significant alterations in 4 of 5 parameters with the exception of relative turn angle of larval locomotion all 3 bps pose ecotoxicological risks to early life stages of aquatic lives because they alter fish locomotion at environmentally relevant concentrations lower nm the bp induced hypoactivity of medaka larvae we observed was similar to other fish species and vertebrates exposed to other pharmaceuticals and personal care products similar behavioral alteration was observed in zebrafish danio rerio oliveira et al 2009 and rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss orvos et al 2002 exposed to triclosan an antibacterial and antifungal used in toothpastes soaps and detergents axelstad et al 2011 de lange et al 2006 kajta and wojtowicz 2013 nassef et al 2010 in the natural environment swimming behavior can reflect the results of physiological stress and environmental toxicant exposure reduced mean velocity or percentage time active reflects the decline in larval swimming ability which in turn risks the ability of fish to move and prey changes in swimming behavior caused by sublethal exposure to contaminants may also impair the ability of fish to feed avoid predation and reproduce little et al 1985 in addition to linking the biological internal and external ecological environment the behavior also shows the comprehensive performance of the brain or nervous system bass and gerlai 2008 such behavioral modifications are a valid and consistent index of sublethal toxicity that can be incorporated in test protocols to expand the sensitivity of standard toxicity tests little and finger 1990 furthermore all 3 bps induced no or minor oxidative stress responses in medaka larvae at certain concentrations with 7 day exposure thus exposures at environmentally relevant concentrations e g 5 50 nm should not result in any significant alteration in oxidative stress response similarly acute exposure 48 hr to bp 3 1 1000 ¬µg l had no or limited effect on the mrna levels of cat sod and gpx in zebrafish embryos at 168 hpf rodr√≠guez fuentes et al 2015 however higher concentrations and long term exposure 0 5 5 0 mg l for 28 days to 4 bps can trigger ros mediated oxidative stress by altering activities of sod cat and gst gsh levels and histopathology in liver of fish carassius auratus with the ranking of bp 1 bp 2 bp 4 bp 3 liu et al 2015 4 2 the endocrine disrupting potency of bps from our in vitro yeast based reporter assay these 7 bps showed certain endocrine disrupting activities except for androgenic and progestogenic activities table 2 bp 1 showed the strongest estrogenic activity ec50 1 294 ¬µm followed by bp 3 then bp 6 and bp 2 this result agrees with previous studies that reported an ec50 of 1 26 ¬µm for bp 1 in an ere luciferase reporter assay suzuki et al 2005 and in a recombinant yeast and luciferase assay expressing the rainbow trout rterŒ± and human estrogen receptor alpha herŒ± kunz et al 2006 molina molina et al 2008 bp 3 was a weak estrogen agonist in an mcf 7 cell proliferation assay schlumpf et al 2001 and rterŒ± and herŒ± luciferase assays gomez et al 2005 kunz and fent 2006 molina molina et al 2008 bp 1 has stronger estrogenic activity in vitro and in vivo than bp 3 because it has higher binding affinity with er kunz et al 2006 molina molina et al 2008 whereas estrogenic activities are higher for bp 1 bp 2 and bp 4 than bp 3 in vitro morohoshi et al 2005 in this study further in vivo evaluation with male medaka exposed to bp 3 revealed its high estrogenic activity because bp 3 highly induced vtg2 er Œ± and chg in liver and bp 1 250 ¬µm also markedly upregulated vtg1 with induction even higher than with bp 3 at the same concentration fig 2 in teleost fish vtg protein is synthesized in the liver regulated by er induced by e2 or xenoestrogens in the aquatic media clelland and peng 2009 acute exposure 48 hr to a high concentration of bp 3 1000 ¬µg l significantly increased vtg1 expression in zebrafish rodr√≠guez fuentes et al 2015 and in vivo exposure of bp 3 increased vitellogenin expression in rainbow trout male medaka and male californian halibut coronado et al 2008 schlenk et al 2005 overall our results confirm that bp 2 has low estrogenic activity in vitro and in vivo bp 1 bp 2 bp 3 and bp 4 elicit estrogenic and also anti androgenic activities in fish our results showed bp 1 with slight anti androgenic activity which was supported by previous studies in nih3t3 and hek293 cells nashev et al 2010 suzuki et al 2005 trans repression of human pr and ar in u2 os cells indicated that bp 3 is an anti progestogenic and anti androgenic compound schreurs et al 2005 which agrees with our results in our study bp 8 was antagonistic toward estrogen ec50 11 22 ¬µm androgen ec50 10 32 ¬µm and progestogen ec50 15 91 ¬µm the bp induced endocrine disrupting actions regarding androgenic and progestogenic activities require further investigation 4 3 in vitro and in vivo tyrosinase inhibition activities of bp 2 to explore additional benefit functions e g inhibition of skin pigmentation to enhance skin whitening of bp type uv filters in order to replace toxic bps we first screened the 7 bps with the mushroom tyrosinase assay the most commonly used and cost effective in vitro bioassay for screening tyrosinase inhibition lin et al 2018 bp 2 was the only compound that showed a dose dependent inhibition of mushroom tyrosinase activity with ec50 value 19 7 ¬µm and 16 inhibition at 10 ¬µm and up to 70 at 50 ¬µm relative to that of kojic acid table 1 and fig 3a melanin is a dark pigment produced by melanocytes in the basal layer of epidermis within membrane bound organelles termed melanosomes tyrosine is the common precursor for melanin production by which it is converted to melanin by the action of the enzyme tyrosinase tyrosinase is found in almost every species and is highly conserved around the active site selinheimo et al 2007 and it plays the key role as the rate limiting enzyme responsible for the conversion of l tyrosine into melanin in melanocytes as such the effect of decreased melanin and pigmentation can be achieved mainly by inhibiting the enzymatic activity of tyrosinase mushroom tyrosinase has similar structural and functional characteristics as those of mammals so the result from this assay is highly relevant and comparable lin et al 2018 previous studies showed that oxyresveratrol 0 3 5 mm and sesamol naturally occurring compounds in plants were potent inhibitors of mushroom tyrosinase baek and lee 2015 shin et al 1998 both compounds share a similarity in their chemical structures i e benzene rings and hydroxyl groups bp 2 has a more similar chemical structure to oxyresveratrol both containing 2 benzene rings and 4 hydroxyl groups which may explain why bp 2 has better ability to inhibit mushroom tyrosinase activity than the other tested bps this study further demonstrated that bp 2 dose dependently decreased the melanin content and tyrosinase activity of zebrafish embryos fig 3c at 20 ¬µm it significantly decreased the content and activity by 20 and 15 of the control respectively zebrafish has melanin pigments on the surface which allows for easy visualization of pigmentation process choi et al 2007 zebrafish larva offer a conserved roles of melanophore genes to mammalian melanocyte genes for understanding pigment cell development and diseases in humans cooper 2017 melanin protects the skin against solar irradiation but over accumulation of melanin can induce hyper pigmentary skin conditions which may cause several problems in appearance mort et al 2015 as such many consumers want a product that will help prevent or minimize the hyperpigmentation from uv overexposure zebrafish embryos treated with bp 3 at 10 to 30 ¬µm did not show significant depigmentation as compared with bp 2 at the same concentrations fig s13 because bp 3 induced massive detrimental effects and developmental toxicities to exposed embryos table s8 which also agreed with our toxicity findings 5 conclusions and environmental implications we successfully established a structured in vitro and in vivo toxicity activity ranking system for screening 7 commonly used bp uv filters fig s14 bp 2 had the least lethal toxicity and almost did not alter oxidative responses and swimming behavior in early life stages of medaka fish under environmentally relevant exposures we assessed the eco toxicological risk of bp 2 and bp 3 by comparing their environmental occurrence concentrations 1 35 ng l for bp 2 and 5 ng l to 7 8 Œºg l for bp 3 and ecotoxicity bp 2 is several folds less toxic than bp 3 bp 2 should have much lower ecological risks to aquatic life than bp 3 additionally we provide in vitro and in vivo evidence suggesting that only bp 2 among the 7 tested bps has promising potential as a melanin pigment inhibitor in addition to being a uv filter in sunscreen or personal care products this potential could gain more attention from industry or consumers to replace the use of toxic bps such as bp 3 with the less toxic and environmentally friendly alternative bp 2 the established strategy and results from this study could facilitate and improve the ecological risk assessments of bp uv filters and other micro pollutants in the aquatic ecosystem declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this work was financially supported by the ntu research center for future earth within the

systematically assessed the in vitro and in vivo toxicity and activity of the 7 most commonly used bps bp 1 bp 2 bp 3 bp 4 bp 6 bp 7 and bp 8 to select bp alternatives with lower ecotoxicity and extra beneficial functions bp 2 lc50 18 43 ¬µm was least toxic and bp 3 lc50 4 10 ¬µm and bp 8 lc50 1 62 ¬µm were less and most toxic respectively in terms of 96 hr acute mortality of medaka larvae bp 2 at environmentally relevant concentrations 5 50 nm did not significantly alter locomotion and oxidative stress responses of medaka larvae from 24 hr to 7 day exposure whereas bp 3 and bp 8 at 5 nm induced hypoactivity or changed fish swimming angles only bp 2 was able to inhibit in vitro mushroom tyrosinase activity with ec50 value 19 7 ¬µm also bp 2 could effectively suppress melanin formation and tyrosinase activity in zebrafish embryos among the 7 tested bps bp 2 was the least toxic and the most environmentally friendly uv filter with extra benefit for tyrosinase inhibition and could be a promising alternative to the use of toxic bps keywords benzophenone uv filters ecotoxicity medaka zebrafish tyrosinase inhibition 1 introduction with the increasing awareness of the danger of excessive exposure to ultraviolet uv rays from the sun the market demand for sunscreen and other personal care products containing uv filters has skyrocketed uv filters are a class of chemicals that can absorb scatter or reflect uv light in the uva and uvb range with wavelengths between 320 and 400 nm and 290 and 320 nm respectively morabito et al 2011 hence they are commonly used as active ingredients in personal care products especially sunscreen lotions and cosmetic products to absorb or block uv rays and thus act as a defensive layer for the skin depending on the types of active ingredients used sunscreens can be divided into physical or chemical sunscreens bp type uv filters are a group of aromatic ketones consisting of two benzene rings linked by a carbonyl group sharing a parent compound known as benzophenone approximately 12 bp derivatives bp 1 to bp 12 have been identified on the basis of different functional groups attached to different positions of the benzene rings table s1 shows the physicochemical properties of the 7 most commonly used bps for instance bp 3 is a relatively photostable lipophilic and bioaccumulative compound with a higher octanol water partition value log kow 3 79 and bioconcentration factor bcf on the other hand bp 1 a metabolite of bp 3 has a lower log kow value 2 96 water solubility and bcf kim and choi 2014 bps are important ingredients in sunscreen but are also widely used in other life aspects such as agricultural and industrial packaging suzuki et al 2005 approximately 10 000 tons of bp uv filters are produced annually for the global market danovaro et al 2008 bp 3 and bp 4 are 2 of the most common uv filters in sunscreen and have been approved as active ingredients in commercial formulation up to 6 and 10 respectively in the united states australia canada europe and china sanchez quiles and tovar sanchez 2015 japan and korea have also permitted the use of bps including bp 1 bp 2 bp 6 and bp 8 in sunscreen lotions shaath 2007 the use of bps in cosmetic and personal care products is summarized in table s2 in addition to sunscreens bps are also widely incorporated in the formulations of shampoos hair dyes nail polishes and body lotions to protect their scent and coloration against uv degradation with concentrations ranging from 0 1 to 10 table s2 not only are they used in personal care items these 7 bps can also be applied in industrial packaging and products table s3 shows other applications of bps in which they are utilized in food and agricultural products packaging materials and production of clear glass or as uv blockers to prevent photodegradation of polymers bp type uv filters can be released into aquatic ecosystems directly via anthropological recreational activities such as bathing and swimming or indirectly via discharge from wastewater treatment plants wwtps balmer et al 2005 table s4 summarizes the distribution and occurrence of 7 bps in environmental matrices of different countries bp 1 bp 2 bp 3 and bp 4 were detected in wwtp influent effluent and sludge in germany wick et al 2010 bp 3 was detected at up to 125 7800 and 10 400 ng l in a swiss lake wwtp effluent in switzerland and wwtp influent in the united states respectively balmer et al 2005 poiger et al 2004 bps were found to contaminate sediments in korea and the united states at concentrations of up to 2140 and 900 ng kg respectively jeon et al 2006 schlenk et al 2005 owing to their unique physicochemical properties i e environmental persistence high lipophilicity photostability and bioaccumulation table s1 a significant amount of bp residues has been detected in living organisms of different habitats widespread occurrence of these chemicals has led to their frequent detection in fish human urine placenta serum and breastmilk in the general population in the united states and european countries calafat et al 2008 frederiksen et al 2013 kunisue et al 2012 schlumpf et al 2010 valle sistac et al 2016 ye et al 2012 several studies have reported that bp 3 dose dependently increased the rate of coral planulae bleaching and was able to transform motile planulae to a sessile state danovaro et al 2008 downs et al 2016 he et al 2019 the occurrence of bps in the aquatic ecosystem and related toxic phenomenon has increased awareness of the risks of such contamination within our ecology making bps an environmental concern although the usage of bps in cosmetics and personal care products is within regulations sanchez quiles and tovar sanchez 2015 some studies have reported allergic reactions of several bps e g bp 3 in mammals and toxicity to non target organisms however the toxic mechanism of most bps and the extent of their toxicities towards aquatic ecosystems remain unknown in a series of in vitro bioassays certain bps e g bp 1 bp 3 and bp 8 have shown several endocrine disrupting potencies toward estrogen receptor er and androgen receptor ar table s5 for instance bp 1 bp 3 and bp 8 showed estrogenicity in mcf 7 cells nakagawa and suzuki 2002 schlumpf et al 2001 bp 1 and bp 3 showed anti estrogenic activity in recombinant yeast and luciferase assays bp 1 a metabolite of bp 3 may possess higher estrogenic or androgenic activity than its parent compound kunz et al 2006 in vivo bp 3 dose dependently increased the uterine weight of immature long evans rats by activating erŒ± and erŒ≤ schlumpf et al 2001 bp 3 decreased androgenic activity after metabolism mediated by rat and human liver microsomes but its metabolite bp 1 was the most potent anti androgenic uv filter watanabe et al 2015 in vivo exposure of bp 3 to rainbow trout male medaka and male californian halibut increased vitellogenin expression schlenk et al 2005 currently most studies have focused on bp 1 and bp 3 the eco toxicities of the remaining bps have not been systematically assessed or ranked in vitro and in vivo in today s fast paced world many consumers desire personal care products to be more functional there has been an increase in the markets in sunscreen products with additional function in skin whitening and or pigmentation inhibition to meet the demand especially in asian countries one study reported the tendency of poly hydroxybenzophenones to inhibit the activity of mushroom tyrosinase wu et al 2011 a critical enzyme in melanogenesis such as melanin formation and pigmentation in many organisms ito and wakamatsu 2008 no study has analyzed both the ecotoxicity and benefit i e tyrosinase inhibition potency of bp type uv filters this study aimed to establish a structured in vitro and in vivo toxicity activity ranking system for the 7 commonly used bps then evaluate their ecotoxicity and tyrosinase inhibition potential to screen for less toxic bps with more benefit a series of specific in vitro cellular bioassays was used for assessing endocrine disrupting potency and genotoxicity of the 7 bps as well as their tyrosinase inhibition activity in mushroom extracts early life stages of medaka fish oryzias latipes a freshwater teleost species native to rice paddies of asia was used as an in vivo toxicity model for assessing the lethal and sublethal toxic effects of tested bps zebrafish danio rerio is an ideal animal model for studying in vivo melanogenesis because it has a high amount of melanin and conservative pathways in melanogenesis similar to humans fukamachi et al 2001 hishida et al 1961 both fish species are cost effective and sensitive small vertebrate models commonly used in basic biology medical and

development oecd and taiwan environmental protection administration guidelines oecd 2019 briefly fish 10 larvae per replicate were transferred to a beaker containing 100 ml erm at 1 day before exposure for acclimation then erm solution was replaced with exposure solutions of 7 bps 1 50 Œºm the selection of the tested concentration range was based on 3 4 runs of range finding tests for each bp data not shown the larval mortality was recorded at 24 48 72 and 96 hr after exposure the dosing solutions were not renewed during fish exposure as static test was performed fish were sufficiently fed during acclimation but not during exposure 2 4 locomotion analysis of bp treated medaka larvae free swimming larvae 7 dph were randomly assigned to 24 well microplates one per well containing erm

duncan test data for locomotor activities and non normally distributed data were analyzed with the non parametric kruskal wallis test statistical significance was set at p 0 05 statistical analysis of experimental data involved using spss 25 spss inc chicago il 3 results 3 1 acute mortality of 7 bps on medaka larvae fig s1 shows the acute mortalities of the 7 tested bps with 96 hr exposure recorded at 24 hr intervals for any change in larval mortality of note no larval death was observed in the blank control and for all tested concentrations of bp 2 after 24 hr of exposure and bp 2 started to cause fish mortality after 48 hr fig s1b however the other 6 bps showed a dose and time dependent increase in larval mortality from 24 hr to 96 hr exposure fig s1 table 1 lists the lc50 values for the 7 bps in medaka larvae at different times based on the results of fig s1 the lc50 values decreased with exposure time but the toxicity ranking of tested bps was similar at any time point in terms of the 96 hr lc50 bp 2 was the least lethal to medaka larvae followed by bp 4 bp 7 bp 3 bp 6 and bp 1 bp 8 was the most lethal 3 2 the effect of bps on medaka larval locomotion three bps bp 2 bp 3 and bp 8 were further evaluated for their potency on altering larval locomotion after 24 hr 48 hr and 7 day exposure table s7 fig s2 s10 bp 2 and bp 8 were selected as the least and most toxic bps from 96 hr acute mortality tests and bp 3 is the most commonly used bps with much toxic evidence for further comparisons with 24 hr exposure all 3 tested bps did not significantly alter larval locomotion at most of the tested parameters and concentrations except bp 3 altered the maximum velocity of medaka larvae at 50 nm and bp 8 altered both the maximum velocity and relative turn angles at 20 nm fig s2 s4 after 48 hr exposure bp 2 and bp 3 significantly induced only one parameter of larval locomotion at the highest tested concentration the percentage time active and absolute turn angle respectively fig s5 s6 however bp 8 had already caused significant changes in 3 parameters of larval locomotion mean velocity maximum velocity and percentage time active at 50 nm fig s7 with 7 day exposure both bp 2 10 nm and bp 3 5 nm evoked hypoactivity as shown by the decreasing trend of the percentage time active for medaka exposed to each compound relative to the control groups fig s s8c s9c however bp 8 at 5 to 50 nm had caused significant alterations in 4 of 5 parameters of larval locomotion with the exception of relative turn angle fig s10 this result indicated that bp 2 was the least toxic at environmentally relevant concentrations followed by bp 3 and lastly bp 8 based on their lowest observed effective concentrations loec summarized in table s7 3 3 ros mediated oxidative stress responses from sublethal exposure to bp 2 bp 3 and bp 8 ros production and activities of antioxidants cat sod gst and gr in medaka larvae were determined after 7 day exposure to bp 2 bp 3 and bp 8 5 to 50 nm fig 1 none of the 3 selected bps significantly induced ros levels in larvae after the exposure period fig 1a all 3 tested bps induced a minor alteration 0 2 to 2 fold change vs the control in antioxidant activities fig 1b e cat activity was significantly increased by bp 2 at 10 and 50 nm and by bp 8 at 50 nm whereas bp 3 decreased cat activity at 50 nm fig 1b the activities of sod gst and gr at most time points and concentrations did not differ significantly from the control level for all 3 bps except bp 8 decreased gst level at 20 nm fig 1d bp 3 significantly decreased gr level at 5 and 20 nm and bp 8 decreased gr level at 20 nm fig 1e 3 4 in vitro toxicity screening of 7 bps fig s11 shows differential dose dependent endocrine disrupting activities in estrogenic anti estrogenic androgenic anti androgenic progestogenic and anti progestogenic activities among the 7 bps from a series of yeast based reporter assays bp 1 showed the strongest estrogenic and anti estrogenic activities followed by bp 2 then the remaining bps fig s11a b all tested bps had no androgenic or progestogenic activities fig s11c and s11e whereas most showed weak anti androgenic or anti progestogenic activities except for bp 1 both bp 2 and bp 4 did not induce significant changes in anti androgenic activities or anti progestogenic activities as compared to the control fig s11e f furthermore all 7 bps did not induce significant genotoxic potency with the rec assay fig s12 from the ec50 ic50 values from the concentration activity curves for the 7 tested bps table 2 bp 1 had highest estrogenic activities and weak anti androgenic activity bp 2 and bp 6 had less and the least estrogenic activities and bp 3 bp 6 bp 7 and bp 8 had both weak anti androgenic and anti progestogenic activities bp 8 also induced weak anti estrogenic activity but bp 4 did not show any endocrine disrupting activity 3 5 the effect of bps bp 1 bp 2 bp 3 and bp 8 on the induction of estrogenic related vitellogenesis in liver of male medaka because bp 1 bp 2 and bp 3 induced significant er based estrogenic activities in in vitro bioassays we further confirmed their ability to induce hepatic estrogenic marker genes including vtg1 vtg2 er Œ± and chg by qpcr with male medaka after 12 day exposure fig 2 normally male fish do not need to produce eggs so the hepatic mrna level of these estrogenic marker genes was low in the blank control groups however the presence of female estrogen e2 could significantly enhance the expression of e2 signaling genes such as er Œ± vtg and chg fig 2 all 4 tested bps significantly upregulated the expression of the vitellogenin encoding genes vtg1 and vtg2 dose dependently at 250 ¬µm bp 1 and bp 3 markedly increased the transcription of both genes and at 500 ¬µm these 2 compounds had upregulated vtg1 and vtg2 by 8000x relative to the control with the exception of bp 3 at 500 ¬µm only a slight increase was observed for er Œ± expression in livers exposed to bp 1 bp 2 and bp 8 regarded as a sensitive biomarker for estrogenic pollutants chg encodes the precursor of inner layer subunits of the egg envelope chen et al 2008 three bps bp 1 bp 3 and bp 8 at both tested concentrations significantly upregulated the expression of chg so these compounds significantly induced estrogenic activity in male medaka after 12 days of exposure 3 6 in vitro mushroom tyrosinase inhibition potency of 7 bps fig 3 a shows a promising dose dependent increase in mushroom tyrosinase activity evoked by bp 2 with an ic50 value of 19 7 ¬µm table 1 bp 2 was already able to inhibit mushroom tyrosinase activity by 16 at 10 ¬µm and approximately 70 of activity at 50 ¬µm relative to kojic acid fig 3a six of the 7 selected bp compounds with the exception of bp 2 showed no significant inhibition of mushroom tyrosinase activity with higher ic50 values than the highest tested concentration of 50 ¬µm table 2 3 7 melanogenesis inhibition potential of bp 2 in zebrafish bp 2 was the only uv filter with potent ability to inhibit mushroom tyrosinase activity from initial screening with the in vitro mushroom tyrosinase assay hence bp 2 was selected for further in vivo validation of its melanogenesis inhibition potential in zebrafish fig 3b shows the phenotypic changes of bp 2 treatments 10 30 Œºm and positive controls on the pigmentation of zebrafish the blank control group showed significant melanin development especially in the eyes body and yolk sac whereas ptu 200 Œºm significantly decreased the pigmentation of zebrafish because the body color was significantly faded to almost white and transparent although not as significant as with ptu exposure bp 2 at different concentrations produced notable fading of pigments a significant decrease in melanin content was observed after treatment with increased concentrations of bp 2 fig 3c as expected of the positive control ptu remarkably decreased the total melanin content of exposed embryos by almost 80 kojic acid also decreased melanin content but to a lesser extent approximately 20 decrease as compared with ptu bp 2 decreased melanin content dose dependently decreased to 92 at the lowest tested concentration of 10 ¬µm when the concentration was increased melanin content of exposed zebrafish embryos significantly decreased at 20 and 30 ¬µm bp 2 treatment decreased melanin by 18 and 30 respectively the melanogenesis inhibition of bp 2 at 20 ¬µm was already comparable to that of kojic acid at 30 ¬µm so bp 2 may be a potential alternative to kojic acid a similar decreasing trend was observed for tyrosinase activity of bp 2 exposed zebrafish embryos fig 3c ptu remarkably decreased the activity of treated embryos by almost 60 whereas kojic acid decreased the activity by 20 bp 2 conferred a dose dependent inhibition of zebrafish tyrosinase activity the activity was decreased to 91 at the lowest tested concentration 10 ¬µm at 20 and 30 ¬µm bp 2 inhibited tyrosinase activity by 15 and 28 respectively bp 2 at 20 ¬µm was as potent as kojic acid at 30 ¬µm in tyrosinase inhibition of exposed zebrafish embryos however zebrafish embryos treated with bp 3 at 10 to 30 ¬µm did not show significant depigmentation fig s13 but showed significant toxicity acute mortality and malformation table s8 at the lowest tested concentration of 10 ¬µm approximately 22 of total exposed embryos showed development of yolk sac edema the proportion of zebrafish embryos with yolk sac edema increased with increasing concentration of bp 3 reaching 54 and 69 with 20 and 30 ¬µm respectively table s8 additionally the phenotypes of bp 3 treated embryos at 48 hpf showed pericardial edema and internal bleeding around the yolk and tail bending at 20 and 30 ¬µm fig s13b c bp 3 induced detrimental effects and developmental toxicities to exposed zebrafish embryos and was not further evaluated for its melanogenesis inhibition potential 4 discussion currently the eco toxicities of commercially available bps have not been comprehensively assessed in vitro and in vivo this current research systematically ranked the toxicity of 7 commercially available bps using sensitive in vivo biomarker assays with medaka fish and specific in vitro bioassays under lethal and sublethal exposures fig s14 bp 2 was identified as the least toxic among the 7 tested bps and at environmentally relevant concentrations bp 2 and bp 3 were further assessed for their melanogenesis inhibition potential because multifunctional uv filtering products could replace the use of more toxic bps such as bp 3 and bp 1 with the increasing awareness of the risk of uv overexposure from sunlight the market for bp containing sunscreen and other pcps has skyrocketed thereby increasing the rate of these bp compounds being washed into water bodies via direct input or daily discharge from wwtps bp 3 oxybenzone has been in the scientific spotlight for many years as one of the most popular choices of active ingredients in many commercial sunscreens it is frequently detected in wwtps and surface waters in countries in europe asia and america ranging from 5 ng l to 7 8 Œºg l in different aquifers table s4 and in 98 of human urine samples in a survey of the us population calafat et al 2008 bp 1 a metabolite of bp 3 is also frequently detected in environmental water samples although at smaller ranges 1 2 722 ng l table s4 although the environmental concentrations of these compounds are relatively low ng l to Œºg l bp type uv filters have become an environmental concern because of their high consumption by many industries persistency in the environment and reported toxic and estrogenic effects in wildlife and laboratory models table s2 s5 4 1 in vivo toxicity ranking of bps and ecotoxicity risks this study first ranked bp 2 as the least lethal followed by bp 4 bp 7 bp 3 bp 6 and bp 1 also based on 96 hr lc50 data bp 8 was the most lethal to medaka larvae table 1 our result is consistent with literature studies of acute toxic effects of bps on different model organisms as compared with bp 3 and bp 4 bp 8 showed relatively higher toxic effects on barnacle nauplius larvae after 24 hr exposure tsui et al 2019 second only to bp 4 bp 2 induced the least acute mortality among uv filters tested with daphnia magna and freshwater free living planaria found in taiwan known as dugesia japonica li 2012 liu et al 2015 however decades of toxicology studies have shown that acute lethality should not be the only endpoint for toxicity evaluation jirova et al 2016 as such we selected 3 bps bp 2 bp 3 and bp 8 for further sublethal toxicity evaluation with the use of sensitive biomarkers such as larval locomotion and oxidative stress responses with broader ranges of environmentally relevant concentrations the sublethal toxicity ranking for the 3 bps agreed with results from the acute toxicity test the extent of bp induced alterations in swimming behavior of medaka larvae after 7 day exposure to 3 bps agreed with the acute mortality results bp 2 was the least toxic followed by bp 3 and lastly bp 8 based on ranking of their loecs table s7 bp 2 10 nm and bp 3 5 nm only decreased the percentage time active hypoactivity of medaka larvae whereas bp 8 at 5 to 50 nm caused significant alterations in 4 of 5 parameters with the exception of relative turn angle of larval locomotion all 3 bps pose ecotoxicological risks to early life stages of aquatic lives because they alter fish locomotion at environmentally relevant concentrations lower nm the bp induced hypoactivity of medaka larvae we observed was similar to other fish species and vertebrates exposed to other pharmaceuticals and personal care products similar behavioral alteration was observed in zebrafish danio rerio oliveira et al 2009 and rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss orvos et al 2002 exposed to triclosan an antibacterial and antifungal used in toothpastes soaps and detergents axelstad et al 2011 de lange et al 2006 kajta and wojtowicz 2013 nassef et al 2010 in the natural environment swimming behavior can reflect the results of physiological stress and environmental toxicant exposure reduced mean velocity or percentage time active reflects the decline in larval swimming ability which in turn risks the ability of fish to move and prey changes in swimming behavior caused by sublethal exposure to contaminants may also impair the ability of fish to feed avoid predation and reproduce little et al 1985 in addition to linking the biological internal and external ecological environment the behavior also shows the comprehensive performance of the brain or nervous system bass and gerlai 2008 such behavioral modifications are a valid and consistent index of sublethal toxicity that can be incorporated in test protocols to expand the sensitivity of standard toxicity tests little and finger 1990 furthermore all 3 bps induced no or minor oxidative stress responses in medaka larvae at certain concentrations with 7 day exposure thus exposures at environmentally relevant concentrations e g 5 50 nm should not result in any significant alteration in oxidative stress response similarly acute exposure 48 hr to bp 3 1 1000 ¬µg l had no or limited effect on the mrna levels of cat sod and gpx in zebrafish embryos at 168 hpf rodr√≠guez fuentes et al 2015 however higher concentrations and long term exposure 0 5 5 0 mg l for 28 days to 4 bps can trigger ros mediated oxidative stress by altering activities of sod cat and gst gsh levels and histopathology in liver of fish carassius auratus with the ranking of bp 1 bp 2 bp 4 bp 3 liu et al 2015 4 2 the endocrine disrupting potency of bps from our in vitro yeast based reporter assay these 7 bps showed certain endocrine disrupting activities except for androgenic and progestogenic activities table 2 bp 1 showed the strongest estrogenic activity ec50 1 294 ¬µm followed by bp 3 then bp 6 and bp 2 this result agrees with previous studies that reported an ec50 of 1 26 ¬µm for bp 1 in an ere luciferase reporter assay suzuki et al 2005 and in a recombinant yeast and luciferase assay expressing the rainbow trout rterŒ± and human estrogen receptor alpha herŒ± kunz et al 2006 molina molina et al 2008 bp 3 was a weak estrogen agonist in an mcf 7 cell proliferation assay schlumpf et al 2001 and rterŒ± and herŒ± luciferase assays gomez et al 2005 kunz and fent 2006 molina molina et al 2008 bp 1 has stronger estrogenic activity in vitro and in vivo than bp 3 because it has higher binding affinity with er kunz et al 2006 molina molina et al 2008 whereas estrogenic activities are higher for bp 1 bp 2 and bp 4 than bp 3 in vitro morohoshi et al 2005 in this study further in vivo evaluation with male medaka exposed to bp 3 revealed its high estrogenic activity because bp 3 highly induced vtg2 er Œ± and chg in liver and bp 1 250 ¬µm also markedly upregulated vtg1 with induction even higher than with bp 3 at the same concentration fig 2 in teleost fish vtg protein is synthesized in the liver regulated by er induced by e2 or xenoestrogens in the aquatic media clelland and peng 2009 acute exposure 48 hr to a high concentration of bp 3 1000 ¬µg l significantly increased vtg1 expression in zebrafish rodr√≠guez fuentes et al 2015 and in vivo exposure of bp 3 increased vitellogenin expression in rainbow trout male medaka and male californian halibut coronado et al 2008 schlenk et al 2005 overall our results confirm that bp 2 has low estrogenic activity in vitro and in vivo bp 1 bp 2 bp 3 and bp 4 elicit estrogenic and also anti androgenic activities in fish our results showed bp 1 with slight anti androgenic activity which was supported by previous studies in nih3t3 and hek293 cells nashev et al 2010 suzuki et al 2005 trans repression of human pr and ar in u2 os cells indicated that bp 3 is an anti progestogenic and anti androgenic compound schreurs et al 2005 which agrees with our results in our study bp 8 was antagonistic toward estrogen ec50 11 22 ¬µm androgen ec50 10 32 ¬µm and progestogen ec50 15 91 ¬µm the bp induced endocrine disrupting actions regarding androgenic and progestogenic activities require further investigation 4 3 in vitro and in vivo tyrosinase inhibition activities of bp 2 to explore additional benefit functions e g inhibition of skin pigmentation to enhance skin whitening of bp type uv filters in order to replace toxic bps we first screened the 7 bps with the mushroom tyrosinase assay the most commonly used and cost effective in vitro bioassay for screening tyrosinase inhibition lin et al 2018 bp 2 was the only compound that showed a dose dependent inhibition of mushroom tyrosinase activity with ec50 value 19 7 ¬µm and 16 inhibition at 10 ¬µm and up to 70 at 50 ¬µm relative to that of kojic acid table 1 and fig 3a melanin is a dark pigment produced by melanocytes in the basal layer of epidermis within membrane bound organelles termed melanosomes tyrosine is the common precursor for melanin production by which it is converted to melanin by the action of the enzyme tyrosinase tyrosinase is found in almost every species and is highly conserved around the active site selinheimo et al 2007 and it plays the key role as the rate limiting enzyme responsible for the conversion of l tyrosine into melanin in melanocytes as such the effect of decreased melanin and pigmentation can be achieved mainly by inhibiting the enzymatic activity of tyrosinase mushroom tyrosinase has similar structural and functional characteristics as those of mammals so the result from this assay is highly relevant and comparable lin et al 2018 previous studies showed that oxyresveratrol 0 3 5 mm and sesamol naturally occurring compounds in plants were potent inhibitors of mushroom tyrosinase baek and lee 2015 shin et al 1998 both compounds share a similarity in their chemical structures i e benzene rings and hydroxyl groups bp 2 has a more similar chemical structure to oxyresveratrol both containing 2 benzene rings and 4 hydroxyl groups which may explain why bp 2 has better ability to inhibit mushroom tyrosinase activity than the other tested bps this study further demonstrated that bp 2 dose dependently decreased the melanin content and tyrosinase activity of zebrafish embryos fig 3c at 20 ¬µm it significantly decreased the content and activity by 20 and 15 of the control respectively zebrafish has melanin pigments on the surface which allows for easy visualization of pigmentation process choi et al 2007 zebrafish larva offer a conserved roles of melanophore genes to mammalian melanocyte genes for understanding pigment cell development and diseases in humans cooper 2017 melanin protects the skin against solar irradiation but over accumulation of melanin can induce hyper pigmentary skin conditions which may cause several problems in appearance mort et al 2015 as such many consumers want a product that will help prevent or minimize the hyperpigmentation from uv overexposure zebrafish embryos treated with bp 3 at 10 to 30 ¬µm did not show significant depigmentation as compared with bp 2 at the same concentrations fig s13 because bp 3 induced massive detrimental effects and developmental toxicities to exposed embryos table s8 which also agreed with our toxicity findings 5 conclusions and environmental implications we successfully established a structured in vitro and in vivo toxicity activity ranking system for screening 7 commonly used bp uv filters fig s14 bp 2 had the least lethal toxicity and almost did not alter oxidative responses and swimming behavior in early life stages of medaka fish under environmentally relevant exposures we assessed the eco toxicological risk of bp 2 and bp 3 by comparing their environmental occurrence concentrations 1 35 ng l for bp 2 and 5 ng l to 7 8 Œºg l for bp 3 and ecotoxicity bp 2 is several folds less toxic than bp 3 bp 2 should have much lower ecological risks to aquatic life than bp 3 additionally we provide in vitro and in vivo evidence suggesting that only bp 2 among the 7 tested bps has promising potential as a melanin pigment inhibitor in addition to being a uv filter in sunscreen or personal care products this potential could gain more attention from industry or consumers to replace the use of toxic bps such as bp 3 with the less toxic and environmentally friendly alternative bp 2 the established strategy and results from this study could facilitate and improve the ecological risk assessments of bp uv filters

more frequent in copacabana 28 6 followed by ipanema 24 1 leblon 21 4 flamengo 13 6 and botafogo 12 3 the highest average bla kpc positive stenotrophomonas spp count was observed for ipanema 32 000

among the 10 water samples studied from each of these beaches across one year 30 100 50 20 and 50 respectively were considered unsuitable for bathing thus we observed no correlation between counts of bla kpc positive stenotrophomonas spp and of fecal indicators graphical abstract moreover the frequency of bla kpc 2 positive stenotrophomonas spp was higher than that of enterobacteriaceae acinetobacter aeromonas and pseudomonas producing carbapenemases found in samples considered suitable for primary contact previously reported by paschoal et al 2017 even though ingestion of contaminated recreational water is a notorious pathway for enteric pathogens transmission schijven et al 2016 this route is irrelevant for acquisition of stenotrophomonas infections steinmann et al 2018 in addition isolates recovered in this study were susceptible to all drugs of choice thus antimicrobial chemotherapy against these isolates in the unlikely event of infections would not be challenging moreover consequences of enteric pathogens transmission upon recreation in aquatic matrices can be minimized when risk assessment studies enabled determining water quality parameters for primary contact harbarth et al 2015 leonard et al 2015 larsson et al 2018 mughini gras et al 2019 by contrast recreational waters are also considered important routes for the community exposure to antimicrobial resistant bacteria harbarth et al 2015 schijven et al 2016 it is speculated that such exposure might predispose for intestinal carriage leonard et al 2018 and even community acquired multidrug resistant infections laurens et al 2018 mills e lee 2019 but risk assessment studies in this scenario are lacking consequently no parameters are available for assessing water quality for primary contact based on antimicrobial resistance such a knowledge gap might result from insufficient surveillance in environment and humans as well as difficulties to address the acquisition event of microorganisms that might have been incorporated into and or that might have transferred resistance determinants to hosts microbiota laurens et al 2018 to date few reports have described beta lactam resistance determinants of medical relevance among stenotrophomonas furlan et al 2018 maraviƒá et al 2014 yang et al 2016 none of them in recreational waters thus the present work further increases the complexity of this scenario by addressing that not only classical enterobacterial pathogens are sources of bla kpc in aquatic matrices but mainly environmental ones against which carbapenem therapy is irrelevant therefore future risk assessment studies to address this issue should not neglect environmental bacteria like stenotrophomonas we observed 55 pulsotypes with 5 subtypes among the 101 stenotrophomonas spp recovered from the first sampling date of each trimester of those 18 presented more than one representative and 37 occurred in singletons supplementary figure based on partial gyrb sequencing of pfge pulsotypes and subtypes 55 isolates 91 7 were identified as belonging to s maltophilia complex including s maltophilia s pavanii p hibisciola and s africana similar to previously published data rhee et al 2013 we observed isolates of s maltophilia grouped in 3 clusters s maltophilia group i n 7 s maltophilia group ii n 30 s maltophilia group iii n 3 s pavanii n 6 p hibisciola n 4 s africana n 3 in addition to isolates belonging to the s maltophilia complex 5 were identified as s acidaminiphila which corresponds to the first description of a strictly environmental stenotrophomonas carrying bla kpc fig 2 it was possible to observe clonally related pulsotypes in the same sampling site and date on 15 occasions however it was also possible to observe indistinguishable and clonally related pulsotypes recovered on different sampling sites and or dates within after up to nine months of interval supplementary figure the presence of pfge clones on the same beach possibly reflects active bacterial multiplication and adaptation to the environment candan and candan 2020 and persistent lineages might play a prominent role in the perpetuation of bla kpc thus deserve further investigation s maltophilia can acquire antimicrobial resistance determinants through horizontal gene transfer via integrons transposons plasmids and genomic islands wang et al 2018 we observed 10 out of 60 isolates showing at least one plasmid fig 3 but it was not possible to confirm if bla kpc 2 was carried by these replicons repetitive attempts to transfer bla kpc 2 failed this finding may suggest that bla kpc is carried by non conjugative plasmids by structures not replicating in the recipient or might be harbored on the chromosome a survey of genetic sequences in the vicinities of bla kpc revealed its insertion into tn4401 isoforms fig 3 in all except one isolate it is a highly active transposon of the tn3 family brandt et al 2019 often found in enterobacteria of clinical origin the risk of mobilization enrichment and transfer of new antimicrobial resistance determinants among environmental bacteria is an actual concern that has been reviewed elsewhere larsson et al 2018 it is speculated that chromobacterium species might play a role in the early evolution of kpc from the environment as it harbors chromosomal beta lactamases phylogenetically related to this enzyme gudeta et al 2016 however environmental bacterial might both serve as donor and acceptor of antimicrobial resistance genes indeed successful exchange of carbapenemase encoding genes from laboratory strains to environmental bacteria has been demonstrated in vitro yousfi et al 2018 given this scenario our findings may result from the transference of resistance determinants from clinical to environmental bacteria as one of the consequences of water contamination by sewage and strengthen the role of recreational aquatic environments as a route for their return to the human sphere 4 concluding remarks stenotrophomonas spp and other environmental bacteria might be relevant reservoirs and vectors of resistance determinants favoring bathers exposure to these resistance determinants especially in waters considered suitable for recreation the presence of bla kpc in several species and multiple genotypes including persistent ones further corroborate the role of the genus in disseminating antimicrobial resistance in such an environment the presence of tn3 like transposons harboring bla kpc in stenotrophomonas spp suggest a potential role for this genus in transmitting this structure to bacteria of medical relevance either in the natural environment or in the gastrointestinal tract of humans directly exposed consequently this

antimicrobial resistant bacteria harbarth et al 2015 schijven et al 2016 it is speculated that such exposure might predispose for intestinal carriage leonard et al 2018 and even community acquired multidrug resistant infections laurens et al 2018 mills e lee 2019 but risk assessment studies in this scenario are lacking consequently no parameters are available for assessing water quality for primary contact based on antimicrobial resistance such a knowledge gap might result from insufficient surveillance in environment and humans as well as difficulties to address the acquisition event of microorganisms that might have been incorporated into and or that might have transferred resistance determinants to hosts microbiota laurens et al 2018 to date few reports have described beta lactam resistance determinants of medical relevance among stenotrophomonas furlan et al 2018 maraviƒá et al 2014 yang et al 2016 none of them in recreational waters thus the present work further increases the complexity of this scenario by addressing that not only classical enterobacterial pathogens are sources of bla kpc in aquatic matrices but mainly environmental ones against which carbapenem therapy is irrelevant therefore future risk assessment studies to address this issue should not neglect environmental bacteria like stenotrophomonas we observed 55 pulsotypes with 5 subtypes among the 101 stenotrophomonas spp recovered from the first sampling date of each trimester of those 18 presented more than one representative and 37 occurred in singletons supplementary figure based on partial gyrb sequencing of pfge pulsotypes and subtypes 55 isolates 91 7 were identified as belonging to s maltophilia complex including s maltophilia s pavanii p hibisciola and s africana similar to previously published data rhee et al 2013 we observed isolates of s maltophilia grouped in 3 clusters s maltophilia group i n 7 s maltophilia group ii n 30 s maltophilia group iii n 3 s pavanii n 6 p hibisciola n 4 s africana n 3 in addition to isolates belonging to the s maltophilia complex 5 were identified as s acidaminiphila which corresponds to the first description of a strictly environmental stenotrophomonas carrying bla kpc fig 2 it was possible to observe clonally related pulsotypes in the same sampling site and date on 15 occasions however it was also possible to observe indistinguishable and clonally related pulsotypes recovered on different sampling sites and or dates within after up to nine months of interval supplementary figure the presence of pfge clones on the same beach possibly reflects active bacterial multiplication and adaptation to the environment candan and candan 2020 and persistent lineages might play a prominent role in the perpetuation of bla kpc thus deserve further investigation s maltophilia can acquire antimicrobial resistance determinants through horizontal gene transfer via integrons transposons plasmids and genomic islands wang et al 2018 we observed 10 out of 60 isolates showing at least one plasmid fig 3 but it was not possible to confirm if bla kpc 2 was carried by these replicons repetitive attempts to transfer bla kpc 2 failed this finding may suggest that bla kpc is carried by non conjugative plasmids by structures not replicating in the recipient or might be harbored on the chromosome a survey of genetic sequences in the vicinities of bla kpc revealed its insertion into tn4401 isoforms fig 3 in all except one isolate it is a highly active transposon of the tn3 family brandt et al 2019 often found in enterobacteria of clinical origin the risk of mobilization enrichment and transfer of new antimicrobial resistance determinants among environmental bacteria is an actual concern that has been reviewed elsewhere larsson et al 2018 it is speculated that chromobacterium species might play a role in the early evolution of kpc from the environment as it harbors chromosomal beta lactamases phylogenetically related to this enzyme gudeta et al 2016 however environmental bacterial might both serve as donor and acceptor of antimicrobial resistance genes indeed successful exchange of carbapenemase encoding genes from laboratory strains to environmental bacteria has been demonstrated in vitro yousfi et al 2018 given this scenario our findings may result from the transference of resistance determinants from clinical to environmental bacteria as one of the consequences of water contamination by sewage and strengthen the role of recreational aquatic environments as a route for their return to the human sphere 4 concluding remarks stenotrophomonas spp and other environmental bacteria might be relevant reservoirs and vectors of resistance determinants favoring bathers exposure to these resistance determinants especially in waters considered suitable for recreation the presence of bla kpc in several species and multiple genotypes including persistent ones further corroborate the role of the genus in disseminating antimicrobial resistance in such an environment the presence of tn3 like transposons harboring bla kpc in stenotrophomonas spp suggest a potential role for this genus in transmitting this structure to bacteria of medical relevance either in the natural environment or in the gastrointestinal tract of humans directly exposed consequently this relationship needs to be further studied and considered when establishing environmental surveillance of antimicrobial resistance for risk assessment purposes declaration of competing interest the
