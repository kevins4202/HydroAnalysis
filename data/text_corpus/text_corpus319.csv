1595,to unveil behavior and fate of uranium u in the quaternary aquifer system of datong basin china we analyzed sediment and groundwater samples and performed geochemical modeling the analyses for sediments were implemented by a sequential extraction procedure and measurements including x ray power diffraction scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy concentrations of main elements and u and 234u 238u activity ratios for groundwater were determined results show that sediment u contents range from 1 93 to 8 80 average 3 00 1 69 mg kg in relation to the total u average fractions of residual u probably as betafite and u vi bound to carbonates and femn oxides are 74 4 18 7 17 2 13 3 and 4 3 2 9 respectively lower average fractions were determined for both organic matter and sulfide bound u mainly as u iv e g brannerite 2 0 0 7 and exchangeable u vi 2 0 2 8 for the groundwater ph 7 36 8 86 ca2uo2 co3 3 0 cauo2 co3 3 2 and uo2 co3 3 4 constitute 99 5 of the total dissolved u and elevated u concentrations occur mainly in shallow aquifers 3 40 m deep below land surface of the west flow through and discharge areas with 50 of the sampled points exceeding 30 μg l we argue that betafite and carbonate weathering and u vi desorption from ferrihydrite are the primary geochemical processes responsible for u mobilization with a minor contrition from u iv oxidation abiotic u iv oxidation may be induced mainly by dissolved oxygen under oxic suboxic conditions e g in the recharge and flow through areas but significantly linked to amorphous ferrihydrite under fe iii and sulfate reducing conditions abiotic u vi reduction could be caused principally by siderite and mackinawite under alkaline conditions higher hco3 concentrations and lower ca2 hco3 molar ratios 0 2 cause formation of cauo2 co3 3 2 and uo2 co3 3 4 and u vi desorption with increases in concentrations of ca2 and ca2 hco3 ratios 0 2 these anionic forms may shift to neutral ca2uo2 co3 3 0 which can facilitate further desorption of u vi our results improve the understanding of u environmental geochemistry and are important for groundwater resources management in this and similar

it has been widely accepted that radioactive disequilibrium of aqueous 234u and 238u 234u 238u ar 1 is due to both direct α recoil and preferential leaching of 234u into ambient solutions andersen et

groundwater with natural u and u relevant radioactive risks banning et al 2012 2013 boland et al 2014 brooks et al 2003 dublet et al 2017 guo et al 2016 2018 hua and deng 2008 lapworth et al 2017 luczaj and masarik 2015 moon et al 2007 nriagu et al 2012 stewart et al 2010 veeramani et al 2013 however little work has been done on transport of geogenic u in shallow quaternary aquifers variations of groundwater chemistry including microbially mediated redox conditions along flow path and with depth anderson and lovley 2002 ph values as well as ligand concentrations are hypothesized to influence u speciation and mobility in subsurface environments this makes mobilization of natural u of environmental concern in this study we choose datong basin an exemplary sedimentary inland basin of china as the study area where the groundwater is contaminated with geogenic u wu et al 2014a we unravel u dynamics by interpreting data from sequential extraction and x ray power diffraction and microscopic spectroscopic analysis for sediments as well as chemistry and u isotopes for groundwater and performing geochemical modeling our aim is to clarify behavior and fate of u in the shallow quaternary aquifer systems 2 hydrogeological setting datong basin is an asymmetric rift system and located in north shanxi province china fig 1a within a semiarid region datong has average annual temperature precipitation and evaporation of 7 0 c 372 mm and up to 1200 mm respectively china meteorological administration 2018 it is surrounded by the hengshan mountain on the east and hongtao

southwest the sanggan river and its tributary huangshui river flow across the basin from the southwest to northeast the sanggan river is the main tributary on the upper reaches of the yongding river that is within the hai river catchment thick cenozoic sediments up to 3500 m deep gu et al 2015 occur all over the basin with decreasing grain size from the margins to the center sediment types are mainly pluvial sand and gravel for the margins and pluvial alluvial and lacustrine sand silt and clay for the plain areas pleistocene sand and gravel constitute the main hydrostratigraphic units which are separated to shallow phreatic and semi confined aquifers and deep confined aquifers by a thick clay layer with the top boundary at the depth of 40 m below land surface bls see fig 1c han 2008 precipitation permeating water from bedrocks and infiltrating surface water are the major recharge sources of the aquifers evaporation pumping and leakage into down gradient parts are their ways of discharge the mountains and pluvial plains are the recharge areas of regional groundwater system the alluvial plains and low lying central parts are the flow through and discharge areas respectively according to groundwater table contours fig 2 three flow paths fps can be delineated fp 1 from the west margins fp 2 from the east margins to the center and fp 3 along the basin the up gradient and

respectively li et al 2016 xie et al 2014 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling three groundwater sampling campaigns with a total of 170 samples from 168 points fig 2 within datong basin were carried out in july 2011 july 2012 and september 2013 among which 167 were individual hand and motor pump wells and one was spring from fractured bedrocks one rainwater sample was also collected in 2012 well depths were obtained from the owners and the locations were determined with a hand held gps referenced to wgs84 during sampling measurements and samples were taken after pumping at least 10 min until water ph eh electrical conductivity and temperature values were stable field measurements for these parameters were made by multi parameter meters hach hq40d calibrated before use and fe2 hs and nh4 were done by a spectrophotometer hach dr2800 alkalinity was determined by the gran titration after filtration through 0 45 μm polyethersulfone filters samples were acidified with gr hno3 for trace element and cation analysis and 85 h3po4 for dissolved organic matter dom analysis but not acidified for anion analysis twenty three sediment core samples were collected from a borehole depth 50 m bls at the dy site fig 2 by rotary drilling in august 2017 sediment samples were wrapped using plastic films and stored in vacuum sealed bags and capped pvc pipes in the field and were kept at room temperature in the laboratory the air dried sediment samples were crushed in an agate mortar and sifted by 200 mesh nylon sieve for geochemical analysis 3 2 digestion and sequential extraction of sediments to determine digested total u contents in the sediments 50 mg sample was weighed in a teflon bomb and moistened with one drop of ultrapure water gr hno3 1 ml and hf 1 ml were added to the sample and then the sealed bomb was heated at 190 c in an oven for 48 h after cooling the bomb was evaporated at 115 c to dryness then 1 ml of gr hno3 was added to the residue and evaporated to dryness the residue was dissolved by adding 3 ml of 30 hno3 and heated at 190 c for 12 h the resulting solution was diluted to 30 0 g with 2 hno3 in polyethylene terephthalate bottles speciation of u in the sediments was also determined following the sequential extraction procedure described by tessier et al 1979 to extract exchangeable u 0 50 g sample was mixed with 8 ml of naoac 1 m ph 8 5 and agitated 150 rpm at room temperature in a 50 ml centrifuge tube for 1 h to ascertain u bound to carbonates 8 ml of naoac 1 m adjusted to ph 4 6 with hoac was added to the residue from the first step and agitated 150 rpm at room temperature for 5 h to dissolve femn oxides 15 ml of nh2oh hcl 0 04 m in 25 hoac was added to the residue from the second step and the mixture was heated to 96 c for 6 h to leach u bound to organic matter om and sulfides the residue from the third step was added 3 ml of hno3 0 02 m and 5 ml of 30 h2o2 adjusted to ph 1 4 with hno3 and the mixture was heated to 85 c for 6 h to prevent u adsorption onto oxidized minerals after cooling 5 ml of nh4oac 3 2 m in 20 hno3 was added and the sample was diluted to 20 ml and agitated 150 rpm at room temperature for 30 min the residual solid from the fourth step may contain mainly primary silicates bearing u within their crystal structure this residual u was determined as the difference between digested total and the sum of the above four steps 3 3 measurements and quality control for ca2 mg2 k na and fe analysis was done using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes thermo fisher iris intrepid ii xsp analysis for u was done by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms perkinelmer elan drc e f cl so4 2 and no3 analysis was done by ion chromatography ic dionex ics 1100 dom analysis was made by a toc analyzer shimadzu toc v using the high temperature catalytic combustion six sediment samples with different lithology and colors at the depth of 2 01 7 35 15 58 22 38 33 23 and 46 93 m bls respectively were selected for x ray power diffraction xrd scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds analysis xrd patterns were recorded by a diffractometer bruker axs d8 focus using cuk α radiation 40 kv 40 ma and a lynxeye detector after gold coating sem and eds were conducted by hitachi su8000 and ametek edax respectively these assays were performed in the state key laboratory of biogeology and environmental geology china university of geosciences precision as relative standard deviation rsd and accuracy were measured by china national certified reference materials gsb series and gbw e 080173 for aqueous elements gbw07390 for chemical composition of floodplain sediments and spiked standard solution agilent technologies gbw07390 was selected because this material was also collected from the hai river catchment mixed standard solutions prepared by the certified reference materials were used in the icp oes icp ms and ic runs for the three times groundwater analyses in 2011 2013 total n of mixed standard solutions was 26 27 and 23 for ic icp oes and icp ms runs respectively using mixed standard solutions as replicates precision for ca2 k mg2 na fe u no3 cl so4 2 and f were calculated to be 3 1 7 9 6 2 2 6 5 2 4 5 2 9 1 5 2 4 and 6 5 with mean accuracy of 100 94 105 98 108 110 99 101 92 and 97 respectively each digestion and sequential extraction sample was measured three times for u precision was 0 1 11 mean 2 2 n 126 the reported data have been calibrated with the accuracies recovery rates of ti v nb and u from the digestion were 90 9 92 3 mean 91 6 n 3 93 4 97 5 mean 95 3 88 8 91 3 mean 89 8 and 99 4 101 6 mean 100 5 respectively 3 4 u isotopes groundwater u isotopes were measured by the methods of the beijing research institute of uranium geology cui et al 2007 li et al 2014 one liter filtered 0 45 μm sample was added 5 g of nh4oac and adjusted to ph 5 2 5 3 with hno3 2 m then it was added to chelex 100 resins and agitated 100 rpm for 10 h which can make 95 u adsorbed on the resins the adsorbed u was then leached from the resins with 5 ml of deionized water and 20 ml of hno3 2 m and the resultant solution was evaporated to dryness to purify u 0 2 ml of ag1x8 resins was charged into a column and washed with 5 ml of deionized water and conditioned with 5 ml of hno3 8 m the u fraction residue was dissolved in 2 ml of hno3 8 m and loaded into the column to remove thorium the column was washed with 2 ml of hno3 8 m followed by 2 ml of hcl 8 m then u solution was obtained by leaching the column with 3 ml of deionized water and evaporated to dryness 234u 238u ar analysis of the residue was done by a thermal ionization mass spectrometer gv instruments isoprobe t equipped with ion counting etp detectors and faraday cups in the beijing research institute of uranium geology a dynamic multiple collection mode with three procedures was conducted etp detectors measuring 234u and 235u ion beams faraday cups measuring 235u and 238u ion beams and monitoring the gain ratios of etp detectors and faraday cups by 235u ion beam the precision was 0 47 n 6 cui et al 2007 the reported 234u 238u ars have been calibrated with china national certified reference material gbw 04428 ar 0 99 0 01 3 5 geochemical modeling and statistical analysis plots of pe ph predominance and u speciation vs ph for the u c fe h2o and fe c s h2o systems were constructed based on the wateq4f dat database by phreeplot saturation indices si of calcite and dolomite partial pressure of co2 g pco2 and proportions of u speciation were modeled based on the phreeqc dat database using phreeqc 3 3 parkhurst and appelo 2013 these databases have been amended by writing in the formation constants of ca uo2 co3 and hydrous ferric oxide hfo uo2 complexes reported by dong and brooks 2006 and luo et al 2007 respectively calculation of average standard deviation sd and correlation coefficient for chemical parameters of groundwater and sediment samples was determined by spss results of tests of variable normality table s1 of supplementary data show that they mostly do not belong to normal distribution thus spearman s correlation coefficients ρ sigma 2 tailed are reported 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial variations of groundwater chemistry groundwater ph values average 8 along the fps 1 and 2 with little tendency but higher values average 8 4 in deep aquifers of the discharge areas fig 3a concentrations of ca2 and hco3 are typically 10 300 and 200 1200 mg l respectively higher in shallow aquifers of the west flow through and discharge areas than in their deep aquifers and increase along the fps 1 and 2 fig 3b c pco2 values range from 10 to 3 5 to 10 1 7 mean 10 2 6 atm fig 3d and are correlated to ph values ρ 0 820 p 01 and hco3 concentrations ρ 0 553 p 01 table s2 values of sicalcite and sidolomite are 0 17 to 1 19 mean 0 56 and 0 04 to 2 66 mean 1 40 respectively fig 3e f suggesting the groundwater is generally saturated with respect to the carbonates groundwater ca2 and hco3 are primarily derived from silicate weathering in addition to carbonate dissolution thus progressive silicate weathering along the fps 1 and 2 wu and wang 2014 may be the main reason for increases in ca2 and hco3 concentrations since carbonate dissolution seems commonly subdued addition of ca2 in shallow aquifers could also result from irrigation and surface waters leaching ca bearing salts from soils in the flow through and discharge areas wu et al 2014b the δ13c values of dissolved inorganic carbon in songnen and datong groundwater were reported to range from 13 5 to 4 38 and 22 0 to 6 9 respectively indicating microbial dom degradation is another source for hco3 in the quaternary aquifers guo et al 2014 xie et al 2013b in the present study dom originated hco3 may be also supported by the correlation between concentrations of hco3 and dom ρ 0 804 p 01 n 19 data see table s3 for datong dom mainly arises from endogenous om in the lacustrine sediments in the dxz site fig 2 sediments average toc contents are 0 71 1 37 n 19 and 0 17 0 16 n 24 within the depths of 9 40 and 40 80 m bls respectively li et al 2016 while much higher toc contents average 1 70 0 69 n 23 exist within the depth of 6 21 m bls for the xgd site sediments xie et al 2014 hence appreciable om deposits in the western central parts may partly account for elevated hco3 concentrations in shallow groundwater of these areas the eh values are generally higher in the recharge and flow through areas and shallow aquifers of the discharge areas average 275 mv than in their deep aquifers average 200 mv fig 3g owing to access of o2 into these zones for the recharge and flow through areas eh values seem higher in the west average 300 mv relative to the east average 250 mv because of greater permeability caused by karstification in the southwest west margins wang et al 2006 fig 1b concentrations of no3 are typically 20 300 mg l in the recharge west and east and west flow through areas and shallow aquifers of the discharge areas but 10 mg l in other zones of the groundwater flow system fig 3h no2 and nh4 concentrations are mostly 0 1 and 1 0 mg l respectively hfo also known as ferrihydrite appelo et al 2002 is calculated as the difference between total fe and fe2 senn and hemond 2002 and commonly 0 6 mg l fe2 and hs concentrations are generally 0 3 mg l and 20 μg l respectively none of hfo fe2 and hs displays clear horizontal vertical trend 4 2 u distribution in the aquifers 4 2 1 sediment u u contents range from 1 93 to 8 80 average 3 00 1 69 n 23 mg kg in the dy site sediments fig 4 the average contents are 2 54 0 72 2 70 0 29 2 32 0 54 2 56 0 61 3 91 2 99 and 5 87 4 15 mg kg in medium sand fine sand silt silty clay clay and sandy clay respectively fig s1a contents of exchangeable carbonate bound femn oxide bound om and sulfide bound and residual u range from 0 01 to 0 93 average 0 10 0 22 0 09 to 3 99 average 0 68 1 04 0 03 to 0 80 average 0 16 0 20 0 03 to 0 27 average 0 06 0 05 and 1 11 to 3 37 average 2 00 0 47 mg kg respectively correspondingly these u species account for 0 3 12 7 average 2 0 2 8 3 8 48 4 average 17 2 13 3 1 4 10 9 average 4 3 2 9 1 2 4 0 average 2 0 0 7 and 24 2 92 5 average 74 4 18 7 of the total u respectively the correlations between total u and u species table s4 show that all these species contribute to u loadings in the sediments medium sand clay and sandy clay have higher contents of exchangeable u and u bound to carbonates femn oxides om and sulfides fig s1b f higher average fractions of 25 1 31 2 are determined for carbonate bound u relative to the total u in medium sand clay and sandy clay samples the fractions for femn oxide and om and sulfide bound u as well as exchangeable u average 5 3 7 1 2 2 and 5 respectively in clay and sandy clay and 8 8 3 6 and 2 5 respectively in medium sand samples quartz muscovite pargasite and albite are identified as the major mineral phases in the xrd patterns with lower amounts of chlorite kaolinite gibbsite calcite dolomite goethite ferrihydrite and pyrite fig 5 according to stages of silicate chemical weathering chamley 1989 coexistence of primary silicates and secondary clays and gibbsite in the samples within the depth of 2 47 m bls show that silicate weathering is heterogeneous in bulk sediments and displays no significant variation with depth betafite as ca u 2 nb ti 2o6 oh f a primary u vi mineral typically from granites and pegmatites bea 1996 chakhmouradian and mitchell 1999 is always identified in the selected samples this commonly occurring betafite may explain the correlation between contents of u and nb ρ 0 528 p 01 table s4 and account for the significant proportion of residual u no correlation exists between u and ti ρ 0 143 because ti is mostly from other minerals as reflected by the much higher contents of ti 0 218 0 493 brannerite often formed from u vi reduction and a common accessory mineral in uraninite and coffinite u deposits finch and murakami 1999 is only identified in sample dy18 for sample dy01 u appears to be not evident on quartz matrices spot 2 of area 1 fig s2a but evident on some fe bearing mineral particles spot 1 of area 1 also u is identified by eds in some well crystalline glittering particles containing high contents of ca and c with ca c o atomic ratios of 1 0 8 3 within area 2 of this sample fig 5a which strongly suggests u is bound to calcite for sample dy04 no obvious enrichment of u is observed either in the na k and fe bearing silicate matrices within area 1 fig s2b while within area 2 some poorly crystalline particles containing high contents of fe are found to hold u fig 5b indicating u is bound to secondary fe hydr oxides atomic composition and sem image of sample dy08 fig 5c show u bearing mixed mineral particles possibly comprised of silicate matrices coated with glittering like calcite and fe hydr oxides such mixed mineral particles are also observed in sample dy13 fig 5d which more likely contain dolomite instead of calcite as the content of mg is high and the mg ca atomic ratio is 1 1 3 for sample dy18 a significant portion of u coexists with nb in the matrices spot 2 of the selected area fig 5e which could be attributed to the primary betafite a smaller portion of u without nb is also apparent in the mixed mineral particles spot 1 fig s2c likewise u is determined in the mixed mineral particles of sample dy23 spot 1 of the selected area fig s2d and appears obvious in the silicate matrices containing higher contents of fe spot 2 fig 5f showing that fe hydro xides the host of u occur as coatings on the matrices 4 2 2 groundwater u groundwater u concentrations are mostly 10 μg l in the recharge west and east and east flow through areas as well as deep aquifers of the west flow through and discharge areas fig 3i shallow groundwater has u up to 199 mean 51 4 209 mean 44 6 and 119 mean 33 4 μg l respectively for the west flow through areas as well as the up gradient and down gradient parts of the discharge areas with 50 of sampled sites 30 μg l groundwater with extremely high u loadings occurs within the depth of 3 20 m bls fig 6 concentrations of u are correlated to concentrations of hco3 ρ 0 471 p 01 and ca2 ρ 0 334 p 01 as well as values of ph ρ 0 418 p 01 and eh ρ 0 265 p 01 table s2 results of modeling show that ca2uo2 co3 3 0 mean 38 2 and cauo2 co3 3 2 mean 47 8 are predominant and uo2 co3 3 4 is mostly 40 mean 13 9 the three species together constitute 99 5 of the total dissolved u for combined modeling conditions and results correlations exist between ca2uo2 co3 3 0 and ca2 ρ 0 571 p 01 hco3 ρ 0 654 p 01 cauo2 co3 3 2 ρ 0 687 p 01 uo2 co3 3 4 ρ 0 959 p 01 and ph ρ 0 347 p 01 table s2 these possibly indicate that under alkaline conditions higher ca2 and lower hco3 concentrations favor ca2uo2 co3 3 0 formation but lower ca2 and higher hco3 concentrations facilitate formation of cauo2 co3 3 2 and uo2 co3 3 4 in other words higher hco3 concentrations may induce shift of ca2uo2 co3 3 0 to the anionic uranyl species 4 3 u vi release similar sequential extraction procedures have been conducted by other authors u bound to femn oxides and carbonates respectively accounts for 16 83 and 2 48 of the total u in the sediments of hetao basin northern china guo et al 2016 fractions of 35 4 21 6 and 35 2 for carbonate and femn oxide bound as well as residual u respectively were determined in the soils of newfoundland island canada alam and cheng 2014 however there may exist oxidation of potentially occurring u iv by o2 during the first two steps of the sequential extraction procedures as they were not subjected to anaerobic conditions for the third step sufficient reduced nh2oh hcl suppresses u iv oxidation oxidation kinetics of uo2 are orders of magnitude slower in dry air at 150 300 c relative to oxidizing waters finch and murakami 1999 the latter can be calculated to be 1 63 per day according to the results of oxidation experiments for microbially reduced u by 20 o2 which corresponds to 0 27 mm dissolved oxygen do moon et al 2007 moreover the reduced species in the sediments can also prevent u iv oxidation by o2 discussion in the next section therefore 1 of u iv could be oxidized by o2 during the period of experiments including 30 days sample preparation because of negatively charged surfaces of om at ph 4 11 hosse and wilkinson 2001 uo2 2 may adsorb on om however it would be leached during the first step as a result of formation of the prevailing anionic uranyl forms see discussion below thus the first three steps of the sequential extraction mainly leach initially holding u vi by desorbing it from surfaces of mineral om and dissolving femn oxides and carbonates incorporation of u vi in calcite and adsorption on quartz clay surfaces have been validated by x ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy analysis occurring as the only phase of u in sediments of the hanford site usa contaminated with waste u catalano et al 2006 wang et al 2005 zachara et al 2013 carbonates and other minerals or their bedrocks with higher u contents are common geogenic sources for its dissolved loadings in germany for example u bearing calcite dissolution and apatite weathering are asserted to be the main mechanisms for elevated groundwater u concentrations 10 μg l german threshold in the fluvial and sandstone aquifers respectively banning and rüde 2015 banning et al 2017 for hetao groundwater u with elevated concentrations in the unconfined alluvial fans up to 322 μg l with 62 of sampled points 30 μg l is claimed to arise from weathering of u containing schist phyllite and carbonate veins guo et al 2016 in the present study the west recharge and flow through areas are hypothesized to receive a significant amount of detritus from the sedimentary rocks which contain higher u contents as a result sediments in these areas are enriched in u compared to the east recharge and flow through areas and therefore essentially responsible for occurrence of high levels of u in the groundwater weathering of betafite as the principal u host may release u vi at a slow rate similar to silicate hydrolysis aside from betafite weathering dissolution of carbonates with relatively high u fractions is an important process for u vi release as well the u fractions hosted by femn oxides are likely underestimated as some u vi could be reduced by the extracting solution nh2oh hcl however even by adding the fractions for om and sulfides the main hosts for u iv their fractions are calculated to be typically 3 7 hence reductive dissolution of fe iii hydr oxides may not induce appreciable mobilization of u due primarily to accompanying reduction of u vi to fe iii see discussion in the nest section and in part to their lower u fractions the point of zero charge values are at ph 8 11 and 9 1 for ferrihydrite and goethite respectively and ph 2 5 for quartz albite and clays appelo et al 2002 heidmann et al 2005 accordingly due to alkaline conditions in most natural environments uo2 2 will be adsorbed on quartz and clays for datong basin where groundwater ph ranges from 7 36 to 8 86 anionic uranyl species can be adsorbed either on goethite or on goethite and ferrihydrite both depending on the ambient ph similarly it has been previously shown that adsorption of u vi on goethite dominates at ph 6 0 relative to kaolinite in the savannah river site usa sediments dong et al 2011 uranyl adsorption on ferrihydrite could form inner sphere mononuclear bidentate hfo uo2 surface complexes dublet et al 2017 as can be seen from the modeling results shown in fig 7 the efficiency of uo2 2 adsorption on hfo is about two orders of magnitude greater than that for silicate and clay minerals at ph 7 9 ames et al 1983 making desorption of u vi another important process controlling u transport in the subsurface in a u c fe h2o system values of ph and pco2 govern u speciation by regulating the complexation between uo2 2 and co3 2 as hco3 and co3 2 concentrations are functions of ph and pco2 values the hfo uo2 and hfo uo2 co3 complexes dominate at ph 5 4 7 8 and uo2 co3 3 4 is predominant at ph 7 8 when 10 3 5 atm pco2 value is considered in the system fig 7a under higher pco2 value conditions for instance 10 2 6 atm uo2 co3 3 4 and uo2 co3 2 2 dominate at ph 6 9 9 fig 7b consequently aqueous u concentrations increase owing to uo2 2 desorption from hfo as indicated by increases in uo2 co3 3 4 and uo2 co3 2 2 proportions with decreasing hfo uo2 fig 7e when with the addition of ca2 60 mg l ca2uo2 co3 3 0 and cauo2 co3 3 2 dominate at ph 7 3 8 9 fig 7c e which is in accordance with the fact that formation of the ternary complexes can decrease adsorption of u vi dong et al 2005 fox et al 2006 meleshyn et al 2009 zheng et al 2003 this is because the ternary complexes effectively out compete hfo and goethite surfaces for available uo2 2 and uo2 co3 complexes owing to their greater association favorability than the binary complexation between the surface and uranyl species stewart et al 2010 in theory anionic cauo2 co3 3 2 should have a higher adsorption affinity than that of neutral ca2uo2 co3 3 0 thus elevated cauo2 co3 3 2 to some extent retards u mobility by lesser adsorption 4 4 possible u redox processes for sediment samples from another borehole of the dy site analyzed in our earlier study some mineral particles measured by eds were found to have an s fe atomic ratio of 1 0 54 fig s3a b pi et al 2017 this represents the stoichiometry of pyrite fes2 and agrees with some results of the xrd patterns fig 5d also it is interesting to note that black and brown concretion grains can be observed in yellowish sand and gray silty clay within 11 0 14 3 m bls in depth at the xgd site fig s4 fe and s peak positions in the eds spectrum of the black concretion grain are identical with those of biogenic mackinawite fes fig s3c f xie et al 2014 veeramani et al 2013 showing its occurrence in the sediments formation of iron sulfides possibly accounts for the low concentrations of fe2 and hs in groundwater presence of iron sulfides in both the dy and xgd site sediment samples indicates that they should be common constituents in aquifers of the discharge areas which are typically under fe iii and sulfate reducing conditions guo and wang 2005 wang et al 2014 providing the iron sulfides have biogenic provenances their existence may be ascribed to the indigenous desulfosporosinus geobacter and desulfuromonas species that obtain energy for growth by transferring electron from om to fe iii so4 2 and u vi lovley et al 1991 2004 this to some extent is reflected by the similar vertical trends between contents of total reduced inorganic sulfur tris and toc within the xgd site sediments fig s5 xie et al 2014 for secondary iron sulfide minerals the first formed fes can persist for a long time in low temperature sedimentary reducing environments and is highly reductive to u vi after rapid sorption at a wide ph range hua and deng 2008 hyun et al 2012 jeong et al 2010 veeramani et al 2013 in this process fes grains may serve as electron reservoirs for u vi reduction which is mediated by biomass associated ligands and microbial reductases bone et al 2017 in terms of chemical u vi reduction pathways the one caused by fe2 can happen only when fe2 is adsorbed on iron hydr oxide surfaces as the reducing capacity is stronger for solid state fe2 compared to aqueous fe2 jeon et al 2005 scott et al 2005 nonetheless shown in fig 8 our modeling results suggest that due to a high pco2 value in the fe c s h2o system at ph 7 9 fe2 domain is constrained while siderite feco3 and fes dominate under modest and strong reducing conditions respectively it is noteworthy that feco3 may perform as an easily available fe ii pool which can favor u vi reduction when it is on the mineral surfaces regenspurg et al 2009 thereby feco3 and fes are probably responsible for chemical reduction of u vi when the aquifers are under fe iii and sulfate reducing conditions in addition a more recent study has found that the reduced u iv may adsorb on om and om coated clay grains bone et al 2017 collectively from geochemical perspectives the close associations between u vi and fe iii and sulfate reduction explain why u iv usually coexists with om and iron sulfides in sedimentary settings in this study brannerite rather than the more geochemically common uraninite and coffinite appears to be the only identified u iv mineral phase and u iv fractions are low as denoted by the values of u held by om and sulfides this indicates u vi reduction does not prevail in the aquifers owing to its relatively low loadings in groundwater both do and no3 are the most important contributors to the oxidizing conditions in the subsurface environments do and no2 chemically oxidize u iv beller 2005 campbell et al 2011 lezama pacheco et al 2015 moon et al 2007 senko et al 2005 ulrich et al 2009 weber et al 2011 which may account for potential u iv oxidative dissolution in the oxic suboxic recharge and flow through areas nonetheless several studies argued that direct oxidization of crystalline uo2 by do and no2 is inhibited as they may preferentially react with fes and biomass but the noncrystalline u iv is susceptible to oxidation abdelouas et al 1999 bi and hayes 2014 bi et al 2013 2016 carpenter et al 2015 suzuki et al 2005 therefore coexistence of u iv with iron sulfides may impede direct u iv oxidation by do and no2 in the discharge areas for fe ii oxidation under aerobic conditions the prevalence of abiotic or biotic pathway depends on concentrations of o2 emerson et al 2010 the latter is probably related to the indigenous gallionella and leptothrix species hedrich et al 2011 fe iii species can form resulting from iron sulfide oxidation ferrihydrite fe oh 3 is the initial hydrolysis product of fe iii solutions caldeira et al 2010 majzlan et al 2004 only when crystalline fe iii hydr oxides are not considered can amorphous ferrihydrite fe oh 3 am become evident in the modeling results fig 8 more importantly fe oh 3 am can oxidize uo2 with higher oxidation extents and rates caused by increases in ph values and concentrations of ca2 and hco3 ginder vogel et al 2006 2010 as reflected by its concentrations a certain amount of fe oh 3 is mobile occurring as nanoparticles dublet et al 2017 hence it is able to contact with solid u iv fig 8 also shows the samples with detectable u all fall within the fe oh 3 am domain with one exception this together with the geochemical constraints on u iv oxidation by o2 and no2 suggests fe oh 3 am is the most likely species responsible for direct chemical u iv oxidation in the discharge areas 4 5 234u 238u activity ratio ar 4 5 1 characterization groundwater 234u 238u ars range from 1 084 to 1 894 average 1 445 0 191 n 19 data see table s3 and are correlated to u concentrations ρ 0 711 p 01 showing that the groundwater is modestly enriched in 234u for stormwater of northern territory australia 234u 238u ars are calculated to range from 0 800 to 1 375 average 1 036 0 151 n 15 on the basis of the reported activity concentrations of 234u and 238u by martin 2003 the values are 1 053 1 385 average 1 166 0 082 n 16 and 1 026 1 087 average 1 056 0 031 n 3 in the rainwater of strasbourg france and central nepal respectively chabaux et al 2001 2005 these studies show that rainwater 234u 238u ars should be generally close to 1 hence the values of 1 056 for the himalayan region may be assigned to the rainwater em of this study which contains 1 5 μg l u fig 9a sample 11 from sandstone aquifers overlying carbonate aquifers at the west mountain front areas see fig 2 is designated as a combination of em 1 and em 3 em 2 can be represented by sample 05 according to the geochemical and hydrogeological framework sample 09 from the discharge areas has the highest u loading in the graph and therefore represents em 4 the high ar 1 894 for sample 11 may be related to carbonates contribution for sample 05 the ar 1 586 is higher than the near equilibrium value for waters draining granites riotte and chabaux 1999 an earlier experimental study showed that release rate of recoiled 234u is high for slow weathering and incipient chemical weathering and preferential leaching of 234u are important for fast weathering andersen et al 2009 thus the potentially higher contents of recoiled 234u for granites and pegmatites within the hengshan metamorphic complex likely account for the higher ar of sample 05 while the commonly higher ars for waters draining carbonates may be caused by fast preferential release of loosely bound 234u however such easily leachable 234u is finite as suggested by 234u deficit in weathered material riotte and chabaux 1999 this shows that effect of 234u preferential leaching on groundwater 234u 238u ars is associated with weathering stages accordingly direct injection of recoiled 234u may increasingly dominate along the fps 1and 2 because it increases with decreasing grain size depaolo et al 2006 lee et al 2010 hence in addition to 234u transport to down gradient parts release of recoiled 234u should be primarily responsible for elevated ars along the fp 2 from samples 05 to 06 and 07 in deep aquifers where influence of rainwater is negligible fig 9b in contrast ars are decreased from samples 12 to 21 and 11 to 16 along the fp 1 which is probably caused by a rapid decline of 234u preferential release along the flow path 4 5 2 insights on u transport in the ar vs u diagram of fig 9a the dashed line represents the ideal mixing of two ems the sample all fall within the big triangle defined by ems 1 3 4 and rainwater or lie along some of the mixing lines suggesting water rock sediment interaction accounts for the observed u concentrations and ars in this view ar variations for example from samples 01 to 10 20 and 19 along the fp 3 reflect different mixing fractions of ems 1 2 and 3 with rainwater the small triangle defined by ems 1 2 3 and rainwater represents the background level of groundwater u 15 μg l primarily resulting from betafite and carbonate weathering mobilized u is transported to down gradient parts of the aquifer system leading to a decrease in its concentration in the recharge areas as a result of rapid replenishment of water thus the increase in u concentrations up to 93 4 μg l in the discharge areas may be mainly ascribed to u vi desorption with minor contributions from u iv oxidation and accumulation of u vi up gradient for both desorption and oxidation of u effects induced by infiltration of surface water and rainwater containing do no3 no2 ca2 and hco3 are significant along the fp 3 and some local short flow paths variation of u concentrations caused by difference in weathering of betafite and carbonate could be neglected u iv may have been oxidized in shallow aquifers which receive oxidizing water recharge and typically have lower ars owing to mixing with rainwater for instance a notable u release caused by oxidation of u iv seems apparent from samples 17 to 18 along the fp 3 as shown by the drastic decrease in ar and appreciable increase in eh but no change in ca2uo2 co3 3 0 fig 9c in contrast from samples 20 to 19 concentrations of u decrease from 66 1 to 30 5 μg l with decreasing ca2uo2 co3 3 0 induced by its shift to cauo2 co3 3 2 and uo2 co3 3 4 this may be due to intensification of u vi adsorption because of increases in anionic uranyl species relative to the uncharged one on the other hand concentrations of u appear to increase with increasing cauo2 co3 3 2 and uo2 co3 3 4 at lower ars along a couple of flow paths as well such as from samples 03 to 09 and 01 to 10 along the fp 3 and 07 to 08 along the fp 2 this may suggest elevated cauo2 co3 3 2 and uo2 co3 3 4 also favor u vi desorption moreover it is found that cauo2 co3 3 2 and uo2 co3 3 4 dominate at higher hco3 concentrations and lower ca2 hco3 molar ratios 0 2 and ca2uo2 co3 3 0 prevails at higher ca2 concentrations and ca2 hco3 ratios 0 2 in other words u vi desorption is associated with its speciation that is regulated by the absolute and relative volumes of ca2 and hco3 at higher hco3 concentrations and lower ca2 hco3 ratios uo2 2 desorption is primarily linked to cauo2 co3 3 2 formation with a minor contribution from uo2 co3 3 4 formation this can be evidenced by the predominance of cauo2 co3 3 2 at ph 7 3 8 9 fig 7e due to a high pco2 value and a relatively low ca2 concentration in the system hence u vi desorption caused by cauo2 co3 3 2 formation may play a critical role in occurrence of high u groundwater in the west flow through and discharge areas owing to higher hco3 concentrations in the zones when ca2 concentrations and ca2 hco3 ratios are both higher u vi desorption may be due primarily to ca2uo2 co3 3 0 and secondarily to cauo2 co3 3 2 formation this means 1 formation of the ternary complexes desorbs uo2 2 and uo2 co3 3 4 and 2 additional ca2 may favor ca2uo2 co3 3 0 formation and thus decrease adsorption of cauo2 co3 3 2 5 conclusions this study investigates u behavior and fate in the quaternary aquifers of datong basin we conclude that u vi phases mainly including betafite lower amounts of u vi bound to carbonates and femn oxides and exchangeable u vi account for the majority of sediment u in the study area occurrence of u iv e g brannerite is minor combined geochemical modeling and groundwater chemistry show that abiotic reduction of u vi could be caused by feco3 and fes consequently u iv phases may coexist with iron sulfides in aquifers of the discharge areas often under fe iii and sulfate reducing conditions which may make the risk of u iv oxidative dissolution underestimated however infiltration of rainwater and surface water can induce iron sulfide oxidation and the subsequent fe oh 3 am may oxidize u iv sediments of potentially higher u contents could essentially result in higher groundwater u loadings in the west flow through and discharge areas do and perhaps no2 may oxidize u iv in the recharge and flow through areas under oxic suboxic conditions a great amount of uo2 2 is released from weathering of betafite and carbonate the main hosts of u vi and significantly adsorbed on hfo under alkaline conditions addition of ca2 and hco3 from mineral weathering salt dissolution and dom degradation may desorb u vi by formation of ca2uo2 co3 3 0 cauo2 co3 3 2 and uo2 co3 3 4 particularly the first two specifically cauo2 co3 3 2 may dominate at higher hco3 concentrations and lower ca2 hco3 molar ratios 0 2 and desorb uo2 co3 3 4 and uo2 2 neutral ca2uo2 co3 3 0 prevails at higher ca2 concentrations and ca2 hco3 ratios 0 2 and contributes to further desorption of the charged u vi species for the study area cauo2 co3 3 2 formation due to higher hco3 concentrations plays an important role in occurrence of high u groundwater in the west flow through and discharge areas ca2 and hco3 concentrations may increase but eh values decrease from the recharge to discharge areas and they all decrease with depth in the quaternary aquifers under alkaline conditions in addition to the hydrogeological framework this geochemical regime regulates u dynamics in the system fig 10 therefore shallow groundwater of the flow through and discharge areas may be not suitable for domestic and irrigation uses because of potential u contamination deep wells and wells in the recharge areas are perhaps appropriate options for groundwater exploitation if effective governance of groundwater resource can prevent land subsidence and infiltration of surficial contaminants to deep aquifers our future interests lie in dynamics of u influenced by anthropogenic inputs as 1 mineral phosphorus fertilizer may contain high contents of u bigalke et al 2018 liesch et al 2015 and 2 no3 may induce oxidation of u iv these findings have a broader meaning for u transport and groundwater resources management in other quaternary aquifer systems under similar hydrogeological and geochemical

1595,to unveil behavior and fate of uranium u in the quaternary aquifer system of datong basin china we analyzed sediment and groundwater samples and performed geochemical modeling the analyses for sediments were implemented by a sequential extraction procedure and measurements including x ray power diffraction scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy concentrations of main elements and u and 234u 238u activity ratios for groundwater were determined results show that sediment u contents range from 1 93 to 8 80 average 3 00 1 69 mg kg in relation to the total u

the total dissolved u and elevated u concentrations occur mainly in shallow aquifers 3 40 m deep below land surface of the west flow through and discharge areas with 50 of the sampled points exceeding 30 μg l we argue that betafite and carbonate weathering and u vi desorption from ferrihydrite are the primary geochemical processes responsible for u mobilization with a minor contrition from u iv oxidation abiotic u iv oxidation may be induced mainly by dissolved oxygen under oxic suboxic conditions e g in the recharge and flow through areas but significantly linked to amorphous ferrihydrite

respectively li et al 2016 xie et al 2014 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling three groundwater sampling campaigns with a total of 170 samples from 168 points fig 2 within datong basin were carried out in july 2011 july 2012 and september 2013 among which 167 were individual hand and motor pump wells and one was spring from fractured bedrocks one rainwater sample was also collected in 2012 well depths were obtained from the owners and the locations were determined with a hand held gps referenced to wgs84 during sampling measurements and samples were taken after pumping at least 10 min until water ph eh electrical conductivity and temperature values were stable field measurements for these parameters were made by multi parameter meters hach hq40d calibrated before use and fe2 hs and nh4

element and cation analysis and 85 h3po4 for dissolved organic matter dom analysis but not acidified for anion analysis twenty three sediment core samples were collected from a borehole depth 50 m bls at the dy site fig 2 by rotary drilling in august 2017 sediment samples were wrapped using plastic films and stored in vacuum sealed bags and capped pvc pipes in the field and were kept at room temperature in the laboratory the air dried sediment samples were crushed in an agate mortar and sifted by 200 mesh nylon sieve for geochemical analysis 3 2 digestion and sequential extraction of sediments to determine digested total u contents in the sediments 50 mg sample was weighed in a teflon bomb and moistened with one drop of ultrapure water gr hno3 1 ml and hf 1 ml were added to the sample and then the sealed bomb was heated at 190 c in an oven for 48 h after cooling the bomb was evaporated at 115 c to dryness then 1 ml of gr hno3 was added to the residue and evaporated to dryness the residue was dissolved by adding 3 ml of 30 hno3 and heated at 190 c for 12 h the resulting solution was diluted to 30 0 g with 2 hno3 in polyethylene terephthalate bottles speciation of u in the sediments was also determined following the sequential extraction procedure described by tessier et al 1979 to extract exchangeable u 0 50 g sample was mixed with 8 ml of naoac 1 m ph 8 5 and agitated 150 rpm at room temperature in a 50 ml centrifuge tube for 1 h to ascertain u bound to carbonates 8 ml of naoac 1 m adjusted to ph 4 6 with hoac was added to the residue from the first step and agitated 150 rpm at room temperature for 5 h to dissolve femn oxides 15 ml of nh2oh hcl 0 04 m in 25 hoac was added to the residue from the second step and the mixture was heated to 96 c for 6 h to leach u bound to organic matter om and sulfides the residue from the third step was added 3 ml of hno3 0 02 m and 5 ml of 30 h2o2 adjusted to ph 1 4 with hno3 and the mixture was heated to 85 c for 6 h to prevent u adsorption onto oxidized minerals after cooling 5 ml of nh4oac 3 2 m in 20 hno3 was added and the sample was diluted to 20 ml and agitated 150 rpm at room temperature for 30 min the residual solid from the fourth step may contain mainly primary silicates bearing u within their crystal structure this residual u was determined as the difference between digested total and the sum of the above four steps 3 3 measurements and quality control for ca2 mg2 k na and fe analysis was done using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes thermo fisher iris intrepid

reference materials gsb series and gbw e 080173 for aqueous elements gbw07390 for chemical composition of floodplain sediments and spiked standard solution agilent technologies gbw07390 was selected because this material was also collected from the hai river catchment mixed standard solutions prepared by the certified reference materials were used in the icp oes icp ms and ic runs for the three

research institute of uranium geology cui et al 2007 li et al 2014 one liter filtered 0 45 μm sample was added 5 g of nh4oac and adjusted to ph 5 2 5 3 with hno3 2 m then it was added to chelex 100 resins and agitated 100 rpm for 10 h which can make 95 u adsorbed on the resins the adsorbed u was then leached from the resins with 5 ml of deionized water and 20 ml of hno3 2 m and the resultant solution was evaporated to dryness to purify u 0 2 ml of ag1x8 resins was charged into a column and washed with 5 ml of deionized water and conditioned with 5 ml of hno3 8 m the u fraction residue was dissolved in 2 ml of hno3 8 m and loaded into the column to remove thorium the column was washed with 2 ml of hno3 8 m followed by 2 ml of hcl 8 m then u solution was obtained by leaching the column with 3 ml of deionized water and evaporated to dryness 234u 238u ar analysis of the residue was done by a thermal ionization mass spectrometer gv instruments isoprobe t equipped with ion counting etp

faraday cups measuring 235u and 238u ion beams and monitoring the gain ratios of etp detectors and faraday cups by 235u ion beam the precision was 0 47 n 6 cui et al 2007 the reported 234u 238u ars have been calibrated with china national certified reference material gbw 04428 ar 0 99 0 01 3 5 geochemical modeling and statistical analysis plots of pe ph predominance and u speciation vs ph for the u c fe h2o and fe c s h2o systems were constructed based on the wateq4f dat database by phreeplot saturation indices si of calcite and dolomite partial pressure of co2 g pco2 and proportions of u

ferric oxide hfo uo2 complexes reported by dong and brooks 2006 and luo et al 2007 respectively calculation of average standard deviation sd and correlation coefficient for chemical parameters of groundwater and sediment samples was determined by spss results of tests of variable normality table s1 of supplementary data show that they mostly do not belong to normal distribution thus spearman s correlation coefficients ρ sigma 2 tailed are reported 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial variations of groundwater chemistry groundwater ph values average 8 along the fps 1 and 2 with little tendency but higher values average 8 4 in deep aquifers of the discharge areas fig 3a concentrations of ca2 and hco3 are typically 10 300 and 200 1200 mg l respectively higher in shallow aquifers of the west flow through and discharge areas than in their deep aquifers and increase along the fps 1 and 2 fig 3b c pco2 values range from 10 to 3 5 to 10 1 7 mean 10 2 6 atm fig 3d and are correlated to ph values ρ 0 820 p 01 and hco3 concentrations ρ 0 553 p 01 table s2 values of sicalcite and sidolomite are 0 17 to 1 19 mean 0 56 and 0 04 to 2 66 mean 1 40 respectively fig 3e f suggesting the groundwater is generally saturated with respect to the carbonates groundwater ca2 and hco3 are primarily derived from silicate weathering in addition to carbonate dissolution thus progressive silicate weathering along the fps 1 and 2 wu and wang 2014 may be the main reason for increases in ca2 and hco3 concentrations since carbonate dissolution seems commonly subdued addition of ca2 in shallow aquifers could also result from irrigation and surface waters leaching ca bearing salts from soils in the flow through and discharge areas wu et al 2014b the δ13c values of dissolved inorganic carbon in songnen and datong groundwater were reported to range from 13 5 to 4 38 and 22 0 to 6 9 respectively indicating microbial dom degradation is another source for hco3 in the quaternary aquifers guo et al 2014 xie et al 2013b in the present study dom originated hco3 may be also supported by the correlation between concentrations of hco3 and dom ρ 0 804 p 01 n 19 data see table s3 for datong dom mainly arises from endogenous om in the lacustrine sediments in the dxz site fig 2 sediments average toc contents are 0 71 1 37 n 19 and 0 17 0 16 n 24 within the depths of 9 40 and 40 80 m bls respectively li et al 2016 while much higher toc contents average 1 70 0 69 n 23 exist within the depth of 6 21 m bls for the xgd site sediments xie et al 2014 hence appreciable om deposits in the western central parts may partly account for elevated hco3 concentrations in shallow groundwater of these areas the eh values are generally higher in the recharge and flow through areas and shallow aquifers of the discharge areas average 275 mv than in their deep aquifers average 200 mv fig 3g owing to access of o2 into these zones for the recharge and flow through areas eh values seem higher in the west average 300 mv relative to the east average 250 mv because of greater permeability caused by karstification in the southwest west margins wang et al 2006 fig 1b concentrations of no3 are typically 20 300 mg l in the recharge west and east and west flow through areas and shallow aquifers of the discharge areas but 10 mg l in other zones of the groundwater flow system fig 3h no2 and nh4 concentrations are mostly 0 1 and 1 0 mg l respectively hfo also known as ferrihydrite appelo et al 2002 is calculated as the difference between total fe and fe2 senn and hemond 2002 and commonly 0 6 mg l fe2 and hs concentrations are generally 0 3 mg l and 20 μg l respectively none of hfo fe2 and hs displays clear horizontal vertical trend 4 2 u distribution in the aquifers 4 2 1 sediment u u contents range from 1 93 to 8 80 average 3 00 1 69 n 23 mg kg in the dy site sediments fig 4 the average contents are 2 54 0 72 2 70 0 29 2 32 0 54 2 56 0 61 3 91 2 99 and 5 87 4 15 mg kg in medium sand fine sand silt silty clay clay and sandy clay respectively fig s1a contents of exchangeable carbonate bound femn oxide bound om and sulfide bound and residual u range from 0 01 to 0 93 average 0 10 0 22 0 09 to 3 99 average 0 68 1 04 0 03 to 0 80 average 0 16 0 20 0 03 to 0 27 average 0 06 0 05 and 1 11 to 3 37 average 2 00 0 47 mg kg respectively correspondingly these u species account for 0

species table s4 show that all these species contribute to u loadings in the sediments medium sand clay and sandy clay have higher contents of exchangeable u and u bound to carbonates femn oxides om and sulfides fig s1b f higher average fractions of 25 1 31 2 are determined for carbonate bound u relative to the total u in medium sand clay and sandy clay samples the fractions for femn oxide and om and sulfide bound u as well as exchangeable u average 5 3 7 1 2 2 and 5 respectively in clay and sandy clay and 8 8 3 6 and 2 5 respectively in medium sand samples quartz muscovite pargasite and albite are identified as the major mineral phases in the xrd patterns with lower amounts of chlorite kaolinite gibbsite calcite dolomite goethite ferrihydrite and pyrite fig 5 according to stages of silicate chemical weathering chamley 1989 coexistence of primary silicates and secondary clays and gibbsite in the samples within the depth of 2 47 m bls show that silicate weathering is heterogeneous in bulk sediments and displays no significant variation with depth betafite as ca u 2 nb ti 2o6 oh f a primary u vi mineral typically from granites and pegmatites bea 1996 chakhmouradian and mitchell 1999 is always identified in the selected samples this commonly occurring betafite may explain the correlation between contents of u and nb ρ 0 528 p 01 table s4 and account for the significant proportion of residual u no correlation exists between u and ti ρ 0 143 because ti is mostly from other minerals as reflected by the much higher contents of ti 0 218 0 493 brannerite often formed from u vi reduction and a common accessory mineral in uraninite and coffinite u deposits finch and murakami 1999 is only identified in sample dy18 for sample dy01 u appears to be not evident on quartz matrices spot 2 of area 1 fig s2a but evident on some fe bearing mineral particles spot 1 of area 1 also u is identified by eds in some well crystalline glittering particles containing high contents of ca and c with ca c o atomic ratios of 1 0 8 3 within area 2 of this sample fig 5a which strongly suggests u is bound to calcite for sample dy04 no obvious enrichment of u is observed either in the na k and fe bearing silicate matrices within area 1 fig s2b while within area 2 some poorly crystalline particles containing high contents of fe are found to hold u fig 5b indicating u is bound to secondary fe hydr oxides atomic composition and sem image of sample dy08 fig 5c show u bearing mixed mineral particles possibly comprised of silicate matrices coated with glittering like calcite and fe hydr oxides such mixed mineral particles are also observed in sample dy13 fig 5d which more likely contain dolomite instead of calcite as the content of mg is high and the mg ca atomic ratio is 1 1 3 for sample dy18 a significant portion of u coexists with nb in the matrices spot 2 of the selected area fig 5e which could be attributed to the primary betafite a smaller portion of u without nb is also apparent in the mixed mineral particles spot 1 fig s2c likewise u is determined in the mixed mineral particles of sample dy23 spot 1 of the selected area fig s2d and appears obvious in the silicate matrices containing higher contents of fe spot 2 fig 5f showing that fe hydro xides the host of u occur as coatings on the matrices 4 2 2 groundwater u groundwater u concentrations are mostly 10 μg l in the recharge west and east and east flow through areas as well as deep aquifers of the west flow through and discharge areas fig 3i shallow groundwater has u up to 199 mean 51 4 209 mean 44 6 and 119 mean 33 4 μg l respectively for the west flow through areas as well as the up gradient and down gradient parts of the discharge areas with 50 of sampled sites 30 μg l groundwater with extremely high u loadings occurs within the depth of 3 20 m bls fig 6 concentrations of u are correlated to concentrations of hco3 ρ 0 471 p 01 and ca2 ρ 0 334 p 01 as well as values of ph ρ 0 418 p 01 and eh ρ 0 265 p 01 table s2 results of modeling show that ca2uo2 co3 3 0 mean 38 2 and cauo2 co3 3 2 mean 47 8 are predominant and uo2 co3 3 4 is mostly 40 mean 13 9 the three species together constitute 99 5 of the total dissolved u for combined modeling conditions and results correlations exist between ca2uo2 co3 3 0 and ca2 ρ 0 571 p 01 hco3 ρ 0 654 p 01 cauo2 co3 3 2 ρ 0 687 p 01 uo2 co3 3 4 ρ 0 959 p 01 and ph ρ 0 347 p 01 table s2 these possibly indicate that under alkaline conditions higher ca2 and lower hco3 concentrations favor ca2uo2 co3 3 0 formation but lower ca2 and higher hco3 concentrations facilitate formation of cauo2 co3 3 2 and uo2 co3 3 4 in other words higher hco3 concentrations may induce shift of ca2uo2 co3 3 0 to the anionic uranyl species 4 3 u vi release similar sequential extraction procedures have been conducted by other authors u bound to femn oxides and carbonates respectively accounts for 16 83 and 2 48 of the total u in the sediments of hetao basin northern china guo et al 2016 fractions of 35 4 21 6 and 35 2 for carbonate and femn oxide bound as well as residual u respectively were determined in the soils of newfoundland island canada alam and cheng 2014 however there may exist oxidation of potentially occurring u iv by o2 during the first two steps of the sequential extraction procedures as they were not subjected to anaerobic conditions for the third step sufficient reduced nh2oh hcl suppresses u iv oxidation oxidation kinetics of uo2 are orders of magnitude slower in dry air at 150 300 c relative to oxidizing waters finch and murakami 1999 the latter can be calculated to be 1 63 per day according to the results of oxidation experiments for microbially reduced u by 20 o2 which corresponds to 0 27 mm dissolved oxygen do moon et al 2007 moreover the reduced species in the sediments can also prevent u iv oxidation by o2 discussion in the next section therefore 1 of u iv could be oxidized by o2 during the period of experiments including 30 days sample preparation because of negatively charged surfaces of om at ph 4 11 hosse and wilkinson 2001 uo2 2 may adsorb on om however it would be leached during the first step as a result of formation of the prevailing anionic uranyl forms see discussion below thus the first three steps of the sequential extraction mainly leach initially holding u vi by desorbing it from surfaces of mineral om and dissolving femn oxides and carbonates incorporation of u vi in calcite and adsorption on quartz clay surfaces have been validated by x ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy analysis occurring as the only phase of u in sediments of the hanford site usa contaminated with waste u catalano et al 2006 wang et al 2005 zachara et al 2013 carbonates and other minerals or their bedrocks with higher u contents are common geogenic sources for its dissolved loadings in germany for example u bearing calcite dissolution and apatite weathering are asserted to be the main mechanisms for elevated groundwater u concentrations 10 μg l german threshold in the fluvial and sandstone aquifers respectively banning and rüde 2015 banning et al 2017 for hetao groundwater u with elevated concentrations in the unconfined alluvial fans up to 322 μg l with 62 of sampled points 30 μg l is claimed to arise from weathering of u containing schist phyllite and carbonate veins guo et al 2016 in the present study the west recharge and flow through areas are hypothesized to receive a significant amount of detritus from the sedimentary rocks which contain higher u contents as a result sediments in these areas are enriched in u compared to the east recharge and flow through areas and therefore essentially responsible for occurrence of high levels of u in the groundwater weathering of betafite as the principal u host may release u vi at a slow rate similar to silicate hydrolysis aside from betafite weathering dissolution of carbonates with relatively high u fractions is an important process for u vi release as well the u fractions hosted by femn oxides are likely underestimated as some u vi could be reduced by the extracting solution nh2oh hcl however even by adding the fractions for om and sulfides the main hosts for u iv their fractions are calculated to be typically 3 7 hence reductive dissolution of fe iii hydr oxides may not induce appreciable mobilization of u due primarily to accompanying reduction of u vi to fe iii see discussion in the nest section and in part to their lower u fractions the point of zero charge values are at ph 8 11 and 9 1 for ferrihydrite and goethite respectively and ph 2 5 for quartz albite and clays appelo et al 2002 heidmann et al 2005 accordingly due to alkaline conditions in most natural environments uo2 2 will be adsorbed on quartz and clays for datong basin where groundwater ph ranges from 7 36 to 8 86 anionic uranyl species can be adsorbed either on goethite or on goethite and ferrihydrite both depending on the ambient ph similarly it has been previously shown that adsorption of u vi on goethite dominates at ph 6 0 relative to kaolinite in the savannah river site usa sediments dong et al 2011 uranyl adsorption on ferrihydrite could form inner sphere mononuclear bidentate hfo uo2 surface complexes dublet et al 2017 as can be seen from the modeling results shown in fig 7 the efficiency of uo2 2 adsorption on hfo is about two orders of magnitude greater than that for silicate and clay minerals at ph 7 9 ames et al 1983 making desorption of u vi another important process controlling u transport in the subsurface in a u c fe h2o system values of ph and pco2 govern u speciation by regulating the complexation between uo2 2 and co3 2 as hco3 and co3 2 concentrations are functions of ph and pco2 values the hfo uo2 and hfo uo2 co3 complexes dominate at ph 5 4 7 8 and uo2 co3 3 4 is predominant at ph 7 8 when 10 3 5 atm pco2 value is considered in the system fig 7a under higher pco2 value conditions for instance 10 2 6 atm uo2 co3 3 4 and uo2 co3 2 2 dominate at ph 6 9 9 fig 7b consequently aqueous u concentrations increase owing to uo2 2 desorption from hfo as indicated by increases in uo2 co3 3 4 and uo2 co3 2 2 proportions with decreasing hfo uo2 fig 7e when with the addition of ca2 60 mg l ca2uo2 co3 3 0 and cauo2 co3 3 2 dominate at ph 7 3 8 9 fig 7c e which is in accordance with the fact that formation of the ternary complexes can decrease adsorption of u vi dong et al 2005 fox et al 2006 meleshyn et al 2009 zheng et al 2003 this is because the ternary complexes effectively out compete hfo and goethite surfaces for available uo2 2 and uo2 co3 complexes owing to their greater association favorability than the binary complexation between the surface and uranyl species stewart et al 2010 in theory anionic cauo2 co3 3 2 should have a higher adsorption affinity than that of neutral ca2uo2 co3 3 0 thus elevated cauo2 co3 3 2 to some extent retards u mobility by lesser adsorption 4 4 possible u redox processes for sediment samples from another borehole of the dy site analyzed in our earlier study some mineral particles measured by eds were found to have an s fe atomic ratio of 1 0 54 fig s3a b pi et al 2017 this represents the stoichiometry of pyrite fes2 and agrees with some results of the xrd patterns fig 5d also it is interesting to note that black and brown concretion grains can be observed in yellowish sand and gray silty clay within 11 0 14 3 m bls in depth at the xgd site fig s4 fe and s peak positions in the eds spectrum of the black concretion grain are identical with those of biogenic mackinawite fes fig s3c f xie et al 2014 veeramani et al 2013 showing its occurrence in the sediments formation of iron sulfides possibly accounts for the low concentrations of fe2 and hs in groundwater presence of iron sulfides in both the dy and xgd site sediment samples indicates that they should be common constituents in aquifers of the discharge areas which are typically under fe iii and sulfate reducing conditions guo and wang 2005 wang et al 2014 providing the iron sulfides have biogenic provenances their existence may be ascribed to the indigenous desulfosporosinus geobacter and desulfuromonas species that obtain energy for growth by transferring electron from om to fe iii so4 2 and u vi lovley et al 1991 2004 this to some extent is reflected by the similar vertical trends between contents of total reduced inorganic sulfur tris and toc within the xgd site sediments fig s5 xie et al 2014 for secondary iron sulfide minerals the first formed fes can persist for a long time in low temperature sedimentary reducing environments and is highly reductive to u vi after rapid sorption at a wide ph range hua and deng 2008 hyun et al 2012 jeong et al 2010 veeramani et al 2013 in this process fes grains may serve as electron reservoirs for u vi reduction which is mediated by biomass associated ligands and microbial reductases bone et al 2017 in terms of chemical u vi reduction pathways the one caused by fe2 can happen only when fe2 is adsorbed on iron hydr oxide surfaces as the reducing capacity is stronger for solid state fe2 compared to aqueous fe2 jeon et al 2005 scott et al 2005 nonetheless shown in fig 8 our modeling results suggest that due to a high pco2 value in the fe c s h2o system at ph 7 9 fe2 domain is constrained while siderite feco3 and fes dominate under modest and strong reducing conditions respectively it is noteworthy that feco3 may perform as an easily available fe ii pool which can favor u vi reduction when it is on the mineral surfaces regenspurg et al 2009 thereby feco3 and fes are probably responsible for chemical reduction of u vi when the aquifers are under fe iii and sulfate reducing conditions in addition a more recent study has found that the reduced u iv may adsorb on om and om coated clay grains bone et al 2017 collectively from geochemical perspectives the close associations between u vi and fe iii and sulfate reduction explain why u iv usually coexists with om and iron sulfides in sedimentary settings in this study brannerite rather than the more geochemically common uraninite and coffinite appears to be the only identified u iv mineral phase and u iv fractions are low as denoted by the values of u held by om and sulfides this indicates u vi reduction does not prevail in the aquifers owing to its relatively low loadings in groundwater both do and no3 are the most important contributors to the oxidizing conditions in the subsurface environments do and no2 chemically oxidize u iv beller 2005 campbell et al 2011 lezama pacheco et al 2015 moon et al 2007 senko et al 2005 ulrich et al 2009 weber et al 2011 which may account for potential u iv oxidative dissolution in the oxic suboxic recharge and flow through areas nonetheless several studies argued that direct oxidization of crystalline uo2 by do and no2 is inhibited as they may preferentially react with fes and biomass but the noncrystalline u iv is susceptible to oxidation abdelouas et al 1999 bi and hayes 2014 bi et al 2013 2016 carpenter et al 2015 suzuki et al 2005 therefore coexistence of u iv with iron sulfides may impede direct u iv oxidation by do and no2 in the discharge areas for fe ii oxidation under aerobic conditions the prevalence of abiotic or biotic pathway depends on concentrations of o2 emerson et al 2010 the latter is probably related to the indigenous gallionella and leptothrix species hedrich et al 2011 fe iii species can form resulting from iron sulfide oxidation ferrihydrite fe oh 3 is the initial hydrolysis product of fe iii solutions caldeira et al 2010 majzlan et al 2004 only when crystalline fe iii hydr oxides are not considered can amorphous ferrihydrite fe oh 3 am become evident in the modeling results fig 8 more importantly fe oh 3 am can oxidize uo2 with higher oxidation extents and rates caused by increases in ph values and concentrations of ca2 and hco3 ginder vogel et al 2006 2010 as reflected by its concentrations a certain amount of fe oh 3 is mobile occurring as nanoparticles dublet et al 2017 hence it is able to contact with solid u iv fig 8 also shows the samples with detectable u all fall within the fe oh 3 am domain with one exception this together with the geochemical constraints on u iv oxidation by o2 and no2 suggests fe oh 3 am is the most likely species responsible for direct chemical u iv oxidation in the discharge areas 4 5 234u 238u activity ratio ar 4 5 1 characterization groundwater 234u 238u ars range from 1 084 to 1 894 average 1 445 0 191 n 19 data see table s3 and are correlated to u concentrations ρ 0 711 p 01 showing that the groundwater is modestly enriched in 234u for stormwater of northern territory australia 234u 238u ars are calculated to range from 0 800 to 1 375 average 1 036 0 151 n 15 on the basis of the reported activity concentrations of 234u and 238u by martin 2003 the values are 1 053 1 385 average 1 166 0 082 n 16 and 1 026 1 087 average 1 056 0 031 n 3 in the rainwater of strasbourg france and central nepal respectively chabaux et al 2001 2005 these studies show that rainwater 234u 238u ars should be generally close to 1 hence the values of 1 056 for the himalayan region may be assigned to the rainwater em of this study which contains 1 5 μg l u fig 9a sample 11 from sandstone aquifers overlying carbonate aquifers at the west mountain front areas see fig 2 is designated as a combination of em 1 and em 3 em 2 can be represented by sample 05 according to the geochemical and hydrogeological framework sample 09 from the discharge areas has the highest u loading in the graph and therefore represents em 4 the high ar 1 894 for sample 11 may be related to carbonates contribution for sample 05 the ar 1 586 is higher than the near equilibrium value for waters draining granites riotte and chabaux 1999 an earlier experimental study showed that release rate of recoiled 234u is high for slow weathering and incipient chemical weathering and preferential leaching of 234u are important for fast weathering andersen et al 2009 thus the potentially higher contents of recoiled 234u for granites and pegmatites within the hengshan metamorphic complex likely account for the higher ar of sample 05 while the commonly higher ars for waters draining carbonates may be caused by fast preferential release of loosely bound 234u however such easily leachable 234u is finite as suggested by 234u deficit in weathered material riotte and chabaux 1999 this shows that effect of 234u preferential leaching on groundwater 234u 238u ars is associated with weathering stages accordingly direct injection of recoiled 234u may increasingly dominate along the fps 1and 2 because it increases with decreasing grain size depaolo et al 2006 lee et al 2010 hence in addition to 234u transport to down gradient parts release of recoiled 234u should be primarily responsible for elevated ars along the fp 2 from samples 05 to 06 and 07 in deep aquifers where influence of rainwater is negligible fig 9b in contrast ars are decreased from samples 12 to 21 and 11 to 16 along the fp 1 which is probably caused by a rapid decline of 234u preferential release along the flow path 4 5 2 insights on u transport in the ar vs u diagram of fig 9a the dashed line represents the ideal mixing of two ems the sample all fall within the big triangle defined by ems 1 3 4 and rainwater or lie along some of the mixing lines suggesting water rock sediment interaction accounts for the observed u concentrations and ars in this view ar variations for example from samples 01 to 10 20 and 19 along the fp 3 reflect different mixing fractions of ems 1 2 and 3 with rainwater the small triangle defined by ems 1 2 3 and rainwater represents the background level of groundwater u 15 μg l primarily resulting from betafite and carbonate weathering mobilized u is transported to down gradient parts of the aquifer system leading to a decrease in its concentration in the recharge areas as a result of rapid replenishment of water thus the increase in u concentrations up to 93 4 μg l in the discharge areas may be mainly ascribed to u vi desorption with minor contributions from u iv oxidation and accumulation of u vi up gradient for both desorption and oxidation of u effects induced by infiltration of surface water and rainwater containing do no3 no2 ca2 and hco3 are significant along the fp 3 and some local short flow paths variation of u concentrations caused by difference in weathering of betafite and carbonate could be neglected u iv may have been oxidized in shallow aquifers which receive oxidizing water recharge and typically have lower ars owing to mixing with rainwater for instance a notable u release caused by oxidation of u iv seems apparent from samples 17 to 18 along the fp 3 as shown by the drastic decrease in ar and appreciable increase in eh but no change in ca2uo2 co3 3 0 fig 9c in contrast from samples 20 to 19 concentrations of u decrease from 66 1 to 30 5 μg l with decreasing ca2uo2 co3 3 0 induced by its shift to cauo2 co3 3 2 and uo2 co3 3 4 this may be due to intensification of u vi adsorption because of increases in anionic uranyl species relative to the uncharged one on the other hand concentrations of u appear to increase with increasing cauo2 co3 3 2 and uo2 co3 3 4 at lower ars along a couple of flow paths as well such as from samples 03 to 09 and 01 to 10 along the fp 3 and 07 to 08 along the fp 2 this may suggest elevated cauo2 co3 3 2 and uo2 co3 3 4 also favor u vi desorption moreover it is found that cauo2 co3 3 2 and uo2 co3 3 4 dominate at higher hco3 concentrations and lower ca2 hco3 molar ratios 0 2 and ca2uo2 co3 3 0 prevails at higher ca2 concentrations and ca2 hco3 ratios 0 2 in other words u vi desorption is associated with its speciation that is regulated by the absolute and relative volumes of ca2 and hco3 at higher hco3 concentrations and lower ca2 hco3 ratios uo2 2 desorption is primarily linked to cauo2 co3 3 2 formation with a minor contribution from uo2 co3 3 4 formation this can be evidenced by the predominance of cauo2 co3 3 2 at ph 7 3 8 9 fig 7e due to a high pco2 value and a relatively low ca2 concentration in the system hence u vi desorption caused by cauo2 co3 3 2 formation may play a critical role in occurrence of high u groundwater in the west flow through and discharge areas owing to higher hco3 concentrations in the zones when ca2 concentrations and ca2 hco3 ratios are both higher u vi desorption may be due primarily to ca2uo2 co3 3 0 and secondarily to cauo2 co3 3 2 formation this means 1 formation of the ternary complexes desorbs uo2 2 and uo2 co3 3 4 and 2 additional ca2 may favor ca2uo2 co3 3 0 formation and thus decrease adsorption of cauo2 co3 3 2 5 conclusions this study investigates u behavior and fate in the quaternary aquifers of datong basin we conclude that u vi phases mainly including betafite lower amounts of u vi bound to carbonates and femn oxides and exchangeable u vi account for the majority of sediment u in the study area occurrence of u iv e g brannerite is minor combined geochemical modeling and groundwater chemistry show that abiotic reduction of u vi could be caused by feco3 and fes consequently u iv phases may coexist with iron sulfides in aquifers of the discharge areas often under fe iii and sulfate reducing conditions which may make the risk of u iv oxidative dissolution underestimated however infiltration of rainwater and surface water can induce iron sulfide oxidation and the subsequent fe oh 3 am may oxidize u iv sediments of potentially higher u contents could essentially result in higher groundwater u loadings in the west flow through and discharge areas do and perhaps no2 may oxidize u iv in the recharge and flow through areas under oxic suboxic conditions a great amount of uo2 2 is released from weathering of betafite and carbonate the main hosts of u vi and significantly adsorbed on hfo under alkaline conditions addition of ca2 and hco3 from mineral weathering salt dissolution and dom degradation may desorb u vi by formation of ca2uo2 co3 3 0 cauo2 co3 3 2 and uo2 co3 3 4 particularly the first two specifically cauo2 co3 3 2 may dominate at higher hco3 concentrations and lower ca2 hco3 molar ratios 0 2 and desorb uo2 co3 3 4 and uo2 2 neutral ca2uo2 co3 3 0 prevails at higher ca2 concentrations and ca2 hco3 ratios 0 2 and contributes to further desorption of the charged u vi species for the study area cauo2 co3 3 2 formation due to higher hco3 concentrations plays an important role in occurrence of high u groundwater in the west flow through and discharge areas ca2 and hco3 concentrations may increase but eh values decrease from the recharge to discharge areas and they all decrease with depth in the quaternary aquifers under alkaline conditions in addition to the hydrogeological framework this geochemical regime regulates u dynamics in the system fig 10 therefore shallow groundwater of the flow through and discharge areas may be not suitable for domestic and irrigation uses because of potential u contamination deep wells and wells in the recharge areas are perhaps appropriate options for groundwater exploitation if effective governance of groundwater resource can prevent land subsidence and infiltration of surficial contaminants to deep aquifers our future interests lie in dynamics of u influenced by anthropogenic inputs as 1 mineral phosphorus fertilizer may contain high contents of u bigalke et al 2018 liesch et al 2015 and 2 no3 may induce oxidation of u iv these findings have a broader meaning for u transport and groundwater resources management in other quaternary aquifer systems under similar hydrogeological and geochemical

1596,the río tinto mining area provides ideal conditions for studying the role of colloidal particles in concentrating all the elements are present in higher concentrations respect to their content in common natural waters 234u 238u activity ratio ranges between 2 286 0 149 and 2 531 0 151 concentration of fe and al are in the order of 104 103 mg l co zn and cu values are three times lower than fe and al but still much greater than in natural waters u reaches values up to 40 73 μg l to evaluate the partitioning of these elements into the colloidal fraction ultrafiltration uf experiments were made a permeation model describing the relationship between concentration of the elements or isotopes in the permeate solution and the concentration factor cf was calculated experiments were carried out using cf from 1 5 to 25 0 the behaviour of investigated heavy metals and u can be predicted by a permeation model that provides similar permeation coefficient pc for all of them pc 0 95 0 97 for 50 kda pc 0 86 0 88 for 10 kda and pc 0 80 0 86 for 3 kda retention for all the investigated elements occurs resulting in up to 23 of the element associated to the 3 kda colloidal fraction the increase in u and heavy metals concentrations in the retentate fraction with the increasing cf is due to the retention of the colloidal fraction the colloidal abundance of related metals increased with decreasing membrane mwco even though the difference is small between 3 and 10 kda fraction for some metals characterization of colloidal material is needed to better understand the state of play in this context keywords acid mine drainage colloidal particles uranium heavy metals ultrafiltration permeation model 1 introduction colloids play a crucial role in regulating speciation bioavailability and mobility of many trace metals radionuclides and contaminants in aquatic environment honeyman and santschi 1989 wang and guo 2000 santschi et al 2002 lead and wilkinson 2006 studies on colloidal element fractionation in acidic environment are scarce e g schemel et al 2000 dold and fontboté 2002 zänker et al 2003 sánchez españa et al 2006 sarmiento et al 2012 as it is also the case of the río tinto area characterized by high ionic strength this lack of studies in acidic waters is probably due to the known fact that at low ph conditions colloidal formation should be negligible kim and walther 2007 also partition coefficients kd between colloidal and dissolved phases are known to be ph dependent usually increasing with ph although several studies have shown an opposite relationship tessier 1992 doucet et al 2007 in addition to this studies have shown that there is a decrease in the kd with the increase in the concentration of suspended matter this behaviour has been interpreted in terms of the particle concentration effect due to the presence of complexing colloidal ligands in the permeates honeyman and santschi 1992 the río tinto mining district has been exploited since 4500 years ago but it is since roman times that mining activity became more developed together with pollution especially when the industrial revolution occurred and mining activity rose again extreme damage to the environment due to the hundreds of mines that were operating during xix and xx centuries producing sulphuric acid copper and other base metals like zn and pb occurred like other mining areas in spain the peña de hierro ore deposit located at río tinto headwaters in the iberian pyritic belt is a rich massive sulphide deposit the río tinto path flow being almost entirely placed in this area the most abundant sulphide is pyrite fes2 and is associated to minerals of economic interest like chalcopyrite cufes2 sphalerite zns galena pbs arsenopyrite feass etc under reducing conditions sulphides are extremely insoluble but long term exposition to weathering led to their oxidation this reaction originates acidity h and produces a high concentration of sulphate so4 2 heavy metals like cd cu pb zn etc some of them highly toxic and ph drop to values 2 favouring the mobilization of heavy metals and natural radionuclides in waters and sediments borrego et al 2001 sánchez españa et al 2005 hierro et al 2012 ketterer et al 2011 these reactions are catalysed by bacteria which increase the rate of the reaction by a factor of 106 nordstrom 1985 williamson et al 1992 kirby and elder brady 1998 kirby et al 1999 sánchez españa et al 2007 scavenging of trace metals depends on particles composition but also on the contact surface between particles and dissolved species which will be more significant in particle rich environments as those occurring in acid mine drainage amd conditions where the capacity for adsorption increases due to high surface area of the precipitates of fe oxyhydroxides phases jamieson et al 2015 and secondary sulphates as ph rises when acidic water is mixed with meteoric water or with non acidic tributaries fig 1 the typical amd chemical composition of waters suggests a strong geologic control on its chemistry dictated by the ore deposit geology and mineralogy ball and nordstrom 1989 goldfarb et al 1996 plumlee et al 1999 nordstrom and alpers 1999 an interesting feature of the amd geochemistry is the high u contents which could be derived from the dissolution of aluminosilicates of the acidic volcanic lithologies present in the area sánchez españa et al 2005 the high particulate matter concentration due to the extreme ligands concentrations in the contaminated water and the low ph makes the presence of dissolved carbonate or bicarbonate negligible as is also the case of the organic matter so the río tinto conditions are ideal to assess the role of colloidal particles on the transport of significant amount of radionuclides and heavy metals and to evaluate their role on the natural remediation of the system the aim of the work is to investigate the behaviour of heavy metals and u in the presence of colloids under these acidic conditions to achieve this goal uf experiments on río tinto water samples was developed using 50 kda 10 kda and 3 kda membranes heavy metals and u concentrations were analysed measuring also u isotopes activities for each of the samples obtained finally a permeation model was established for the discussed elements 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and on site analyses the río tinto presents a catchment area of approximate 1676 km2 and a length of about 100 km before reaching the ría de huelva estuary fig 2 water samples for this study were collected at its headwaters close to the drainage of the waste pile of the peña de hierro ore deposit in the north east of the huelva province sampling was performed on march 29th 2017 ph oxidation reduction potential and conductivity were immediately measured in situ with a calibrated multiparametric probe hanna equipped with probes hi9025c hi9033 and hi9025 samples were transported to the laboratory at the university of cádiz where subsequent experiments of uf and isotopic analyses were carried out next day to avoid any precipitation or sorption of elements onto the sampling containers density of the water was measured first by a densimeter and later on by weight and volume in a volumetric flask ten measurements 2 2 ultrafiltration experiments collected water was firstly filtered through pre cleaned 0 45 μm and 0 20 μm cellulose nitrate membranes in order to remove the coarser grain fraction and to obtain water for subsequent cross flow ultrafiltration cfuf experiments this technique isolates colloids from the water in a relatively short time and provides the feed flow tangentially across the surface of the filter with the main advantages that the substances retained by the membrane are constantly washed away preventing the layer cake formation the uf system used is a masterflex l s peristaltic pump system with a vivaflow 200 pes polyethersulfone membrane with an active membrane area of 200 cm2 recirculation rate was set to result in 5 ml s of permeate flow the membrane device was firstly pre cleaned following the recommended cleaning procedure implemented on the used membrane at the end of each uf experiment the following terms are used in the text permeate is the fraction passing through a cfuf membrane while the retentate is the fraction retained by the membrane uf was carried out using concentration factor cf ratio of the initial volume respect to the retentate volume from 1 5 to 25 0 using membranes with molecular weight cut off mwco of 50 10 and 3 kda and obtaining a permeate and a retentate solution from each selected concentration factor of each experiments obtained water samples needed to be diluted to a factor of 1 10 because the high concentration of metals and radionuclides concentration lead to saturation of the signal in the icp aes instrument 2 3 icp analysis the concentration of the investigated heavy metals al cd co cr cu fe ni zn in the solution was found out using a thermo elemental iris intrepid icp aes the detection limits were 0 600 mg l for al 0 200 mg l for fe 0 130 mg l for co 0 100 mg l for zn 0 050 mg l for cr 0 040 mg l for cu and ni and 0 020 mg l for cd the analytical uncertainties for this method expressed as 1 s d for n 3 were 1 for al and 2 for the others except for cu which uncertainty was 3 to determine isotopic composition and radionuclide activities by icp ms samples were prepared following a procedure which provides for isotope dilution analysis and extraction chromatography casas ruiz and barbero 2015 to gain a controlled and more accurate analyse replicate samples and standard materials preparation containing marine coral and a preparation of u ore concentrate were included as well as blanks prepared with distilled water milli q water both acidified according to the procedure u isotopes were measured with a thermo scientific xseries 2 quadrupole icp ms equipped with a cetac 5000 ultrasonic nebulizer the acquisition parameters were 100 ms dwell time 50 sweeps in 25 s and a timing washout between 10 and 120 s four sequential integrations of each sample were acquired to monitor the sensibility of the analyses a cleaning solution of hno3 2 were random tested together with the samples the mass bias factor mbf was calculated to correct the raw results the instrumentation exhibited a very stable mass discrimination behaviour by using counting data from icp ms and results from isotope dilution analysis it is then possible to derive the concentration of u in the samples the disadvantage of this method is its inaccuracy since it carries an error up to 20 25 2 4 ultrafiltration permeation model to appropriately describe size fractionation of the elements the permeation and retention behaviour of chemical species have been investigated e g guo and santschi 1996 dai et al 1998 guo et al 2000b 2001 the typical application of cfuf technique provides the concentration method where the pre filtered sample is concentrated from a single sample reservoir obtaining the cf from the ratio between the initial sample volume versus the retentate one the mwco defines the corresponding spherical size of macromolecules that can be retained by a specific membrane and it is usually expressed in kda or atomic molar mass unit amu each uf experiment permits the partitioning of molecules of different size between a retentate solution and a permeate solution since compounds with larger size than the mwco of a selected uf membrane are quantitatively retained and the those having lower molecular weight pass through without retention if there is a constant permeation log of concentration of a specie in the permeate solution cp plotted versus log cf should result in a linear relationship described in the equation lncp ln pc cf 0 1 pc ln cf where pc is the permeation coefficient of low molecular weight lmw of the investigated element defined as the ratio of cp to cf concentration in the feed solution at any given point of the uf and cf 0 is the initial concentration of permeable species in the upstream feed solution the model assumes negligible sorption and constant retention characteristics of the membrane other than a constant partitioning across the membrane for high and low mw solutes the slope of the derived equation 1 pc gives the pc value which is related to the rejection coefficient rc by pc 1 rc and could be equal to 1 when there is no retention for that element resulting in the same concentration of that element in both permeate solution and feed solution at any time of the uf process if instead pc 1 that means that retention occurs at each uf cycle with the consequence that the concentration of any chemical species in the permeate will increase with increasing cf guo and santschi 1996 3 results and discussion sampled water shows a high redox potential with an eh of 637 mv and an electrical conductivity of 19 13 ms cm the ph is acidic with a value of 2 09 the density is 1 042 g cm3 these parameters reflect the nature of the water which results from the weathering of a big rock pile storage of prevailing pyritic waste whose oxidation leads to the release of a high amount of acidity h sulphate so4 2 iron and other related trace metals 3 1 heavy metals behaviour concentrations of the samples from the filtrations through 0 45 μm and 0 20 μm membranes show very high values for al co cu fe and zn passing through 0 45 μm membrane are 1741 mg l 13 92 mg l 7 075 mg l 12 810 mg l and 9 163 mg l respectively while for the same elements passing through 0 20 μm membrane are 1549 mg l 12 22 mg l 5 885 mg l 11 370 mg l and 7 798 mg l respectively this decrease in the concentration values with the decreasing of the membrane pore size amounting to 11 for al and fe 12 for co 14 for zn and 16 for cu could be interpreted as the percentage of elements associated to the 0 45 0 20 μm fraction dilution led to cd cr and ni concentrations lower than the detection limits so these values are not shown samples from the uf experiment show concentration values varying in a wide range appendix a these values do not show significant differences among themselves for different membrane pore size even if the general trend is little higher concentration values for the retentate samples compared with the permeate samples that means that it can always be found elements associated to the colloidal fraction retained by the membrane other than little increase in the retentate values with decreasing membrane pore size from 50 kda to 10 kda this points to the presence of a small size colloids in the solution fe shows the highest concentration showing values in the range of 7043 12 500 mg l in permeate samples and 8488 14 570 mg l in retentate samples followed by al that ranges between 945 mg l and 1719 mg l in the permeate samples and 1198 mg l and 2060 mg l in the retentate samples results for the other metals show values three orders of magnitude lower than fe and al concentrations being their ranges 7 58 13 32 mg l for co passing through the membranes and 9 29 16 64 mg l for co retained by the membranes 5 34 8 93 mg l for permeate zn and 6 55 10 88 mg l for retained zn and 3 63 6 42 mg l for permeate cu and 4 46 7 93 mg l for cu retained by the membranes the increase in metal concentrations in the retentate with increasing cf is due to the retention by the membrane of colloids higher than mwco of each membrane it can be said that membrane efficiently separates colloids from the solution up to 10 kda while there is no significant partition over this size limit since results obtained from 3 kda experiments are practically the same to 10 kda results nonetheless obtained values are extremely high with respect to the ones reported for natural waters bibliography about concentration and partitioning to the colloidal fraction of the elements in acidic environment is scarce zänker et al 2002 present some data on fe with concentrations of 680 mg l of fe associated to the retained fraction size of 3 100 kda for ph 2 7 there are previous data about the chemical composition of río tinto water after passing through 0 45 μm filters that show for ph 2 6 the following concentrations fe 393 mg l al 75 mg l zn 61 mg l cu 27 mg l mn 11 mg l and lower values of as cd co ni and pb olías et al 2006 other results from cánovas et al 2010 on río tinto water at ph 2 4 after using a 0 45 μm pore size filter show fe concentrations up to 103 mg l al values exceeding 500 mg l cu and zn reaching 102 mg l and trace metals like cd co and ni with values of the order of mg l sánchez españa et al 2005 characterized the geochemistry of the water of 64 amd discharges from 25 different mines in the ipb draining the odiel river watershed just eastside to the río tinto reporting extreme concentration of metals in the water filtered at 0 45 μm up to 7 7 g l fe 2 6 g l al 1 4 g l zn 435 mg l cu in these acid waters co reaches maximum values of 48 mg l and ni and cd 17 mg l and 8 mg l respectively similar to the río tinto ones obtained from this work analysis that at 0 45 μm show concentrations of metals up to thousand times higher than in natural waters 1 7 g l al 1 3 g l fe 13 9 mg l co 7 1 mg l cu and 9 2 mg l zn concerning non acidic waters guéguen and dominik 2003 reported concentrations in upper vistula river separating the 1 kda fraction from the truly dissolved fraction in the waters for ph 7 2 7 8 fe is even no detectable in water because all of it is associated to the retentate fractions while co cu and zn range in 0 24 2 94 μg l 0 6 82 1 μg l and 13 2 162 0 μg l respectively ross and sherrell 1999 studied an area in new jersey pinelands and in bass river filtrating sampled waters at 10 kda for the lowest ph detected 4 55 they reported concentrations of 30 μg l for al 65 μg l for fe 0 1 μg l for cu and 3 8 μg l for zn guo et al 2000a found that levels of trace metals cu pb zn cd co ni cr be fe al mn v ba and ti in marine colloids 1 kda 0 20 μm ranged from 0 1 to 50 μg g colloidal matter except for fe which generally had a concentration 120 μg g besides data on dissolved and colloidal trace element concentration were determined in the estuaries which represents complex systems in which biogeochemical processes take place and influence elements pathway dai and martin 1995 reported trace metal concentrations in the obi and yenisey river estuary systems dissolved cd and pb are in the order of pg l cu and ni do not reach 1 μg l and dissolved fe range is 0 5 2 5 μg l while retentate cd and pb values again are negligible retained ni is in the order of ng l cu 0 92 1 56 μg l and retained fe 17 2 23 1 μg l 3 2 uranium behaviour u concentration in 0 45 μm filtered water is 36 45 μg l while in 0 20 μm filtered water are 34 52 μg l this little decrease matches the 5 of u associated to the 0 45 0 20 μm fraction the range of u concentration in the ultrafiltered samples is 17 37 40 73 μg l with an average of 34 22 μg l samples show no significant differences among them but the general trend is toward lower values for the permeate fraction meaning that u can be retained by the membranes uranium average concentration in seawater is 3 3 ppb e g ku et al 1977 while in common surface waters it presents temporal and spatial variability strongly dependent on the local redox conditions plater et al 1992 but still predominantly in the order of ng l as documented in swarzenski et al 1995 andersson et al 2001 or guo et al 2007 u concentration in río tinto was already shown by casas ruiz and barbero 2015 that reported values up to 200 μg l at ph 2 5 after 0 45 μm filtering the extreme elevated u concentration results from acidic conditions of the study area that lead to the mobilization of high levels of natural radionuclides furthermore the area is characterized by acidic volcanoclastic rocks into which u is naturally partitioned that under amd conditions suffer the continuous dissolution of minerals and the subsequent release of the associated elements into the waters evidences of this are shown by high correlations r2 0 99 between u and all the investigated elements which confirms that u could derived from the dissolution of aluminosilicates of the acidic volcanic lithologies present in the area río tinto carries a high concentration of u that under these conditions ph 2 3 would remain in solution either as uranil or as uranium sulphate or bisulfate complexes soluble species u will be significantly scavenged when a change in ph induce co precipitation of u and other dissolved metals as metallic hydroxides or sulphate salts this process is mainly evident when abrupt changes of ph ocurr when river water mixes with the estuarine water and ph increases to 4 hierro et al 2012 3 3 uranium isotopes behaviour 234u 238u activity ratios ar disequilibrium in natural waters is related to the recoil process which causes preferent release of 234u as the decay product of 238u disintegration from the solid into the solution and the perturbation of the crystal lattice where 238u was located this lead to the preferential leaching of 234u respect to 238u as this process is time depended the study of u series disequilibrium represents an excellent tool and a chronometer of weathering processes furthermore during water rock interactions and their transport in solution each of other nuclides of the u series behave differently than u for instance th 230th is the daughter of 234u is known to be a very insoluble element for ph 3 this variability led to significant geochemical fractionation among these nuclides since except in highly reducing or highly ligand rich solutions fluid phase will be generally enriched in u and the residual solid phases in th chabeaux et al 2008 the accuracy and precision of the instruments used resulted in about 2 consistent with the typical bias of spectroscopy methods of investigation that is usually as high as 2 data on 234u 238u ar in surface natural water and groundwater are abundant in the literature e g osmond and cowart 1976 sarin et al 1990 kronfeld and vogel 1991 andersson et al 1995 porcelli et al 1997 rivers typically show 234u 238u 1 while groundwater usually show much higher 234u 238u ratios borole et al 1982 reviewed available u isotopes data in world rivers and estimated a 234u 238u ar weighted mean amounting to 1 20 0 06 calculated 234u 238u activity ratios on collected water in río tinto samples are in a range of 2 29 0 15 to 2 53 0 15 with no systematic variation previous works in río tinto waters registered a 234u 238u ar ranging between 1 5 and 3 0 ketterer et al 2011 here the highest values were explained as a consequence of the acid drainage that preferentially lixiviates 234u relative to 238u from minerals in the mining areas the 234u 238u ar should be close to unity when the complete dissolution of the solid matrix occurs barbero et al 2014 so this is not the case another acid mine drainage case that could be compared with río tinto one is the ogoya mine one in japan where tedori and kakehashi rivers waters show a 234u 238u ar around 3 1 yamamoto et al 2010 here the authors assigned the exceptional high 234u 238u ar values up to 16 8 1 8 founded in samples closest to the mine zone to the deeper underground water having high 234u concentration due to preferential leaching of 234u under neutral and reducing conditions 234u 238u ar average reported from this work amount to 2 42 0 24 consistent with further results concerning dissolved matter from río tinto water exposed by hierro et al 2013 2 2 0 1 this disequilibrium is imputable to the excess of 234u related both to the recoil effect enhanced by the weathering that leads to a reduction in the grain size and to the preferential lixiviation conducted by acidic water the activities of the u isotopes vary in the range 0 01 1 25 bq l with 235u activity concentration that could be considered irrelevant since its highest value is 0 02 bq l 238u activity varies between 0 22 and 0 51 bq l while 234u show values between 0 50 and 1 25 bq l 3 4 permeation model on the basis of the permeation model expressed by the equation for a straight line y ax b it can be possible to calculate pc value from the slope and estimate the amount of the retention for that chemical species at each uf cycle furthermore cf 0 can be derived from the combination of the intercept b and the pc value using exp b pc while using the estimated cf 0 the initial colloidal fraction can be predicted as 1 cf 0 ct 0 where ct 0 is the measured total dissolved concentration guo and santschi 1996 guo et al 2000b 3 4 1 heavy metals cd cr and ni concentrations are lower than the detection limits so it was not possible to develop a permeation model for them the rest of the investigated metals al co cu fe an zn exhibit similar permeation behaviour with permeation coefficients pc from the first experiment 50 kda ultrafiltration of 0 96 for al and fe and 0 97 for co cu and zn fig 3 this suggests that for each uf cycle the 50 kda membrane let 96 97 of lmw elements to pass through it and 3 are retained as compounds with a molecular size higher than 50 kda despite the high abundance of suspended matter in this acid mine drainage waters analyses are usually performed on water sample normally filtered at 0 20 μm or 0 45 μm membrane filters e g sánchez españa et al 2005 with no further filtering the model estimates that around 2 8 of these metals are associated to 50 kda colloidal fraction demonstrating that up to 8 of the concentration of these metals in a traditional 0 20 μm filtration is associated to the 50 kda colloidal fraction concentrations estimated by the model for the 50 kda filtered water are 1440 50 mg l for al 11 31 mg l for co 5 41 mg l for cu 10 417 59 mg l for fe and 7 61 mg l for zn lower permeation values arise from the other two experiments fig 4 and fig 5 pc 0 86 0 88 for 10 kda membrane and 0 82 0 86 for 3 kda membrane with a two fold increase in the percentage of the fraction associated to colloids 15 21 here the estimated concentrations are 1250 57 mg l 9 72 mg l 4 64 mg l 9031 90 mg l and 6 67 mg l for al co cu fe and zn respectively in the 10 kda filtered water samples while for the 3 kda filtered water concentrations are 1243 94 mg l 10 13 mg l 4 81 mg l 9159 34 mg l and 6 83 mg l for the same elements it can be observed that these elements show similar behaviour in both 10 kda and 3 kda experiments which indicates that they are not associated to the 3 kda colloid fraction so 10 kda is the smallest size in which it is possible to find metals associated to colloids and they possibly contribute up to 21 in the concentration of the element in the water 3 4 2 uranium the application of the permeation model for u contents in the permeate samples explains the behaviour of the lmw u interacting with the three membranes the constant permeation coefficients are pc 0 95 for 50 kda membrane pc 0 86 through 10 kda membrane and pc 0 80 for the 3 kda experiment figs 3 5 this implies that for each uf cycle the 50 kda membrane retains 5 as compounds with a molecular size higher than 50 kda while the 10 kda membrane retains 14 of u finally the 3 kda membrane retains up to 20 of the dissolved u previous results about u behaviour ultrafiltered at 5 kda gave values of pc 0 847 casas ruiz and barbero 2015 so the permeation behaviour of u resulting from this work experiments can be considered coherent with previous results casas ruiz and barbero 2015 showed that the permeation model estimated around 9 of u associated to 5 kda colloidal fraction from this work it was obtained 5 17 and 23 of u associated to 50 10 and 3 kda fraction respectively values estimated from the model are 31 65 μg l 27 47 μg l and 25 46 μg l for 50 kda 10 kda and 3 kda respectively 3 4 3 uranium isotopes considering the 234 235 and 238 u isotopes they show results really similar to the one obtained for the concentration of u demonstrating no differences in the behaviour and similar percentages in the colloidal fraction fig 6 as expected for 234u the permeation coefficients are 0 97 0 87 and 0 79 for the 50 kda 10 kda and 3 kda uf experiment respectively while for 235u and 238u they are the same 0 95 0 86 and 0 80 for 50 kda 10 kda and 3 kda membrane respectively this means that the uf does not affect the isotope fractionation since isotopes just differ in neutron number and exhibit identical chemical behaviour this is also confirmed by the percentage of the three isotopes in the colloidal fraction 4 16 and 25 of 234u associated to the 50 kda 10 kda and 3 kda fraction 5 19 and 23 of 235u associated to the 50 kda 10 kda and 3 kda fraction and 5 17 and 23 of 238u in the 50 kda 10 kda and 3 kda fraction respectively in particular 238u reflects exactly the same results of u element 3 5 recovery an alternative classic method to calculate percentage of elements associated to the colloidal fraction considers the measurements of the volume of all the fraction involved in each uf experiment and allows an accurate mass balance that is critical even not very sensitive to assess the recovery of the uf experiments guo and santschi 1996 the mass balance is obtained using the following equation recovery cp vp cr vr c 0 v 0 100 where cp cr and c0 are the measured concentration in the permeate retentate and initial solution respectively and vp vr and v0 are the respective volumes involved in the uf experiments in table 1 it can be observed that recoveries for u and zn result excellent 95 115 for al co cu and fe they are reasonably good with recoveries of 90 99 and up to 110 for the 3 kda experiments suggesting that this membrane exhibits minimal contamination and processing losses in contrast recovery from samples from lower cf reveals large losses of elements during uf experiments mainly 80 it might be due to low cfs that seem to be inadequate to extract the elements and render a permeate that will be representative of their actual permeation behaviour previous works mention artifact retention of the dissolved species at low cfs due to the retention of lmw molecules during uf that leads to an overestimation of the elements associated to the colloidal fraction guo et al 2000b 2007 losses of the elements might be due to the nature of them whose dissolved form is positive charged and physicochemical interactions with the uf membranes which in general are negatively charged with the consequent retention of the element onto the membrane surface or pores 4 conclusions the acid mine drainage environment of río tinto area promotes the presence of heavy metals and uranium in solution chemical characterization of stream water is usually performed on samples filtered at 0 45 μm or 0 20 μm without considering colloidal fraction contribution compared to common natural waters concentrations of all elements are at least three orders of magnitude higher the high values of the measurements were expected because of the nature of acid mine drainage condition u derives from the dissolution of aluminosilicates contained in the acidic volcanic rocks of the area via chemical weathering under amd conditions the solid phases being dissolved and releasing heavy metals so4 2 and acidity into the water a good correlation between u and elements such as al and zn was found suggesting that this radionuclide derives from leaching of the host rock 238u activity varies between 0 22 and 0 51 bq l while 234u show values between 0 50 and 1 25 bq l leading to 234u 238u activity ratios range between 2 29 0 15 and 2 53 0 15 the disequilibrium is attributable to the excess of 234u related both to the recoil effect and the acidic water preferentially lixiviates 234u respect to 238u from minerals in the mining areas there is no systematic variation between the different size fractions and no isotopic fractionation with respect to elemental u distribution between the different phases as isotopes of the same element are expected to exhibit a similar chemically behaviour uf experiments for different membrane pore sizes and distinct cf allow the construction a permeation model to interpret the size fractionation data properly throughout the río tinto although investigated species will exist in dissolved form a significant fraction of them could be associated to colloids the models estimate 7 8 of al co cu and fe associated to the 50 kda colloidal fraction 19 21 of them associated to the 10 kda colloidal fraction while just 2 of zn is associated to the 50 kda fraction and 15 in the 10 kda colloids colloidal u amounts to 5 and 17 for 50 kda and 10 kda respectively it can be observed that there is not an increase in the values of estimated colloidal fraction with decreasing of the pore size from 10 to 3 kda due to the absence of colloids 10 kda except for u whose 3 kda colloidal form shows contributions up to 23 to the u concentration in water recovery is excellent although it seems that low cf are inadequate to extract the elements and to obtain a permeate that will be representative of their actual permeation behaviour this could be due to interactions between the negatively charged membrane and the positive charged elements in future work it would be important to characterize the nature of the colloidal material for each size membrane experiment in order to validate this scenario and to understand how colloids composition affects the partitioning of elements from the solution acknowledgments this work is included in the

1596,the río tinto mining area provides ideal conditions for studying the role of colloidal particles in concentrating all the elements are present in higher concentrations respect to their content in common natural waters 234u 238u activity ratio ranges between 2 286 0 149 and 2 531 0 151 concentration of fe and al are in the order of 104 103 mg l co zn and cu values are three times lower than fe and al but still much greater than in natural waters u reaches values up to 40 73 μg l to evaluate the partitioning of these elements into the colloidal fraction ultrafiltration uf experiments were made a permeation model describing the relationship between concentration of the elements or isotopes in the permeate solution and the concentration factor cf was calculated experiments were carried out using cf from 1 5 to 25 0 the behaviour of investigated heavy metals and u can be predicted by a permeation model that provides similar permeation coefficient pc for all of them pc 0 95 0 97 for 50 kda pc 0 86 0 88 for 10 kda and pc 0 80 0 86 for 3 kda retention for all the investigated elements occurs resulting in up to 23 of the element associated to the 3 kda colloidal fraction the increase in u and heavy metals concentrations in the retentate fraction with the increasing cf is due to the retention of the colloidal fraction the colloidal abundance of related metals increased with decreasing membrane mwco even though the difference is small between 3 and 10 kda fraction for some metals characterization of colloidal material is needed to better understand the state of play in this context keywords acid mine drainage colloidal particles uranium heavy metals ultrafiltration permeation model 1 introduction colloids play a crucial role in regulating speciation bioavailability and mobility of many trace metals radionuclides and contaminants in aquatic environment honeyman and santschi 1989 wang and guo 2000 santschi et al 2002 lead and wilkinson 2006 studies on colloidal element fractionation in acidic environment are scarce e g schemel et al 2000 dold and fontboté 2002 zänker et al 2003 sánchez españa et al 2006 sarmiento et al 2012 as it is also the case of the río tinto area characterized by high ionic strength this lack of studies in acidic waters is probably due to the known fact that at low ph conditions colloidal formation should be negligible kim and walther 2007 also partition coefficients kd between colloidal and dissolved phases are known to be ph dependent usually increasing with ph although several studies have shown an opposite relationship tessier 1992 doucet et al 2007 in addition to this studies have shown that there is a decrease in the kd with the increase in the concentration of suspended matter this behaviour has been interpreted in terms of the particle concentration effect due to the presence of complexing colloidal ligands in the permeates honeyman and santschi 1992 the río tinto mining district has been exploited since 4500 years ago but it is since roman times that mining activity became more developed together with pollution especially when the industrial revolution occurred and mining activity rose again extreme damage to the environment due to the hundreds of mines that were operating during xix and xx centuries producing sulphuric acid copper and other base metals like zn and pb occurred like other mining areas in spain the peña de hierro ore deposit located at río tinto headwaters in the iberian pyritic belt is a rich massive sulphide deposit the río tinto path flow being almost entirely placed in this area the most abundant sulphide is pyrite fes2 and is associated to minerals of economic interest like chalcopyrite cufes2 sphalerite zns galena pbs arsenopyrite feass etc under reducing conditions sulphides are extremely insoluble but long term exposition to weathering led to their oxidation this reaction originates acidity h and produces a high concentration of sulphate so4 2 heavy metals like cd cu pb zn etc some of them highly toxic and ph drop to values 2 favouring the mobilization of heavy metals and natural radionuclides in waters and sediments borrego et al 2001 sánchez españa et al 2005 hierro et al 2012 ketterer et al 2011 these reactions are catalysed by bacteria which increase the rate of the reaction by a factor of 106 nordstrom 1985 williamson et al 1992 kirby and elder brady 1998 kirby et al 1999 sánchez españa et al 2007 scavenging of trace metals depends on particles composition but also on the contact surface between particles and dissolved species which will be more significant in particle rich environments as those occurring in acid mine drainage amd conditions where the capacity for adsorption increases due to high surface area of the precipitates of fe oxyhydroxides phases jamieson et al 2015 and secondary sulphates as ph rises when acidic water is mixed with meteoric water or with non acidic tributaries fig 1 the typical amd chemical composition of waters suggests a strong geologic control on its chemistry dictated by the ore deposit geology and mineralogy ball and nordstrom 1989 goldfarb et al 1996 plumlee et al 1999 nordstrom and alpers 1999 an interesting feature of the amd geochemistry is the high u contents which could be derived from the dissolution of aluminosilicates of the acidic volcanic lithologies present in the area sánchez españa et al 2005 the high particulate matter concentration due to the extreme ligands concentrations in the contaminated water and the low ph makes the presence of dissolved carbonate or bicarbonate negligible as is also the case of the organic matter so the río tinto conditions are ideal to assess the role of colloidal particles on the transport of significant amount of radionuclides and heavy metals and to evaluate their role on the natural remediation of the system the aim of the work is to investigate the behaviour of heavy metals and u in the presence of colloids under these acidic conditions to achieve this goal uf experiments on río tinto water samples was developed using 50 kda 10 kda and 3 kda membranes heavy metals and u concentrations were analysed measuring also u isotopes activities for each of the samples obtained finally a permeation model was established for the discussed elements 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and on site analyses the río tinto presents a catchment area of approximate 1676 km2 and a length of about 100 km before reaching the ría de huelva estuary fig 2 water samples for this study were collected at its headwaters close to the drainage of the waste pile of the peña de hierro ore deposit in the north east of the huelva province sampling was performed on march 29th 2017 ph oxidation reduction potential and conductivity were immediately measured in situ with a calibrated multiparametric probe hanna equipped with probes hi9025c hi9033 and hi9025 samples were transported to the laboratory at the university of cádiz where subsequent experiments of uf and isotopic analyses were carried out next day to avoid any precipitation or sorption of elements onto the sampling containers density of the water was measured first by a densimeter and later on by weight and volume in a volumetric flask ten measurements 2 2 ultrafiltration experiments collected water was firstly filtered through pre cleaned 0 45 μm and 0 20 μm cellulose nitrate membranes in order to remove the coarser grain fraction and to obtain water for subsequent cross flow ultrafiltration cfuf experiments this technique isolates colloids from the water in a relatively short time and provides the feed flow tangentially across the surface of the filter with the main advantages that the substances retained by the membrane are constantly washed away preventing the layer cake formation the uf system used is a masterflex l s peristaltic pump system with a vivaflow 200 pes polyethersulfone membrane with an active membrane area of 200 cm2 recirculation rate was set to result in 5 ml s of permeate flow the membrane device was firstly pre cleaned following the recommended cleaning procedure implemented on the used membrane at the end of each uf experiment the following terms are used in the text permeate is the fraction passing through a cfuf membrane while the retentate is the fraction retained by the membrane uf was carried out using concentration factor cf ratio of the initial volume respect to the retentate volume from 1 5 to 25 0 using membranes with molecular weight cut off mwco of 50 10 and 3 kda and obtaining a permeate and a retentate solution from each selected concentration factor of each experiments obtained water samples needed to be diluted to a factor of 1 10 because the high concentration of metals and radionuclides concentration lead to saturation of the signal in the icp aes instrument 2 3 icp analysis the concentration of the investigated heavy metals al cd co cr cu fe ni zn in the solution was found out using a thermo elemental iris intrepid icp aes the detection limits were 0 600 mg l for al 0 200 mg l for fe 0 130 mg l for co 0 100 mg l for zn 0 050 mg l for cr 0 040 mg l for cu and ni and 0 020 mg l for cd the analytical uncertainties for this method expressed as 1 s d for n 3 were 1 for al and 2 for the others except for cu which uncertainty was 3 to determine isotopic composition and radionuclide activities by icp ms samples were prepared following a procedure which provides for isotope dilution analysis and extraction chromatography casas ruiz and barbero 2015 to gain a controlled and more accurate analyse replicate samples and standard materials preparation containing marine coral and a preparation of u ore concentrate were included as well as blanks prepared with distilled water milli q water both acidified according to the procedure u isotopes were measured with a thermo scientific xseries 2 quadrupole icp ms equipped with a cetac 5000 ultrasonic nebulizer the acquisition parameters were 100 ms dwell time 50 sweeps in 25 s and a timing washout between 10 and 120 s four sequential integrations of each sample were acquired to monitor the sensibility of the analyses a cleaning solution of hno3 2 were random tested together with the samples the mass bias factor mbf was calculated to correct the raw results the instrumentation exhibited a very stable mass discrimination behaviour by using counting data from icp ms and results from isotope dilution analysis it is then possible to derive the concentration of u in the samples the disadvantage of this method is its inaccuracy since it carries an error up to 20 25 2 4 ultrafiltration permeation model to appropriately describe size fractionation of the elements the permeation and retention behaviour of chemical species have been investigated e g guo and santschi 1996 dai et al 1998 guo et al 2000b 2001 the typical application of cfuf technique provides the concentration method where the pre filtered sample is concentrated from a single sample reservoir obtaining the cf from the ratio between the initial sample volume versus the retentate one the mwco defines the corresponding spherical size of macromolecules that can be retained by a specific membrane and it is usually expressed in kda or atomic molar mass unit amu each uf experiment permits the partitioning of molecules of different size between a retentate solution and a permeate solution since compounds with larger size than the mwco of a selected uf membrane are quantitatively retained and the those having lower molecular weight pass through without retention if there is a constant permeation log of concentration of a specie in the permeate solution cp plotted versus log cf should result in a linear relationship described in the equation lncp ln pc cf 0 1 pc ln cf where pc is the permeation coefficient of low molecular weight lmw of the investigated element defined as the ratio of cp to cf concentration in the feed solution at any given point of the uf and cf 0 is the initial concentration of permeable species in the upstream feed solution the model assumes negligible sorption and constant retention characteristics of the membrane other than a constant partitioning across the membrane for high and low mw solutes the slope of the derived equation 1 pc gives the pc value which is related to the rejection coefficient rc by pc 1 rc and could be equal to 1 when there is no retention for that element resulting in the same concentration of that element in both permeate solution and feed solution at any time of the uf process if instead pc 1 that means that retention occurs at each uf cycle with the consequence that the concentration of any chemical species in the permeate will increase with increasing cf guo and santschi 1996 3 results and discussion sampled water shows a high redox potential with an eh of 637 mv and an electrical conductivity of 19 13 ms cm the ph is acidic with a value of 2 09 the density is 1 042 g cm3 these parameters reflect the nature of the water which results from the weathering of a big rock pile storage of prevailing pyritic waste whose oxidation leads to the release of a high amount of acidity h sulphate so4 2 iron and other related trace metals 3 1 heavy metals behaviour concentrations of the samples from the filtrations through 0 45 μm and 0 20 μm membranes show very high values for al co cu fe and zn passing through 0 45 μm membrane are 1741 mg l 13 92 mg l 7 075 mg l 12 810 mg l and 9 163 mg l respectively while for the same elements passing through 0 20 μm membrane are 1549 mg l 12 22 mg l 5 885 mg l 11 370 mg l and 7 798 mg l respectively this decrease in the concentration values with the decreasing of the membrane pore size amounting to 11 for al and fe 12 for co 14 for zn and 16 for cu could be interpreted as the percentage of elements associated to the 0 45 0 20 μm fraction dilution led to cd cr and ni concentrations lower than the detection limits so these values are not shown samples from the uf experiment show concentration values varying in a wide range appendix a these values do not show significant differences among themselves for different membrane pore size even if the general trend is little higher concentration values for the retentate samples compared with the permeate samples that means that it can always be found elements associated to the colloidal fraction retained by the membrane other than little increase in the retentate values with decreasing membrane pore size from 50 kda to 10 kda this points to the presence of a small size colloids in the solution fe shows the highest concentration showing values in the range of 7043 12 500 mg l in permeate samples and 8488 14 570 mg l in retentate samples followed by al that ranges between 945 mg l and 1719 mg l in the permeate samples and 1198 mg l and 2060 mg l in the retentate samples results for the other metals show values three orders of magnitude lower than fe and al concentrations being their ranges 7 58 13 32 mg l for co passing through the membranes and 9 29 16 64 mg l for co retained by the membranes 5 34 8 93 mg l for permeate zn and 6 55 10 88 mg l for retained zn and 3 63 6 42 mg l for permeate cu and 4 46 7 93 mg l for cu retained by the membranes the increase in metal concentrations in the retentate with increasing cf is due to the retention by the membrane of colloids higher than mwco of each membrane it can be said that membrane efficiently separates colloids from the solution up to 10 kda while there is no significant partition over this size limit since results obtained from 3 kda experiments are practically the same to 10 kda results nonetheless obtained values are extremely high with respect to the ones reported for natural waters bibliography about concentration and partitioning to the colloidal fraction of the elements in acidic environment is scarce zänker et al 2002 present some data on fe with concentrations of 680 mg l of fe associated to the retained fraction size of 3 100 kda for ph 2 7 there are previous data about the chemical composition of río tinto water after passing through 0 45 μm filters that show for ph 2 6 the following concentrations fe 393 mg l al 75 mg l zn 61 mg l cu 27 mg l mn 11 mg l and lower values of as cd co ni and pb olías et al 2006 other results from cánovas et al 2010 on río tinto water at ph 2 4 after using a 0 45 μm pore size filter show fe concentrations up to 103 mg l al values exceeding 500 mg l cu and zn reaching 102 mg l and trace metals like cd co and ni with values of the order of mg l sánchez españa et al 2005 characterized the geochemistry of the water of 64 amd discharges from 25 different mines in the ipb draining the odiel river watershed just eastside to the río tinto reporting extreme concentration of metals in the water filtered at 0 45 μm up to 7 7 g l fe 2 6 g l al 1 4 g l zn 435 mg l cu in these acid waters co reaches maximum values of 48 mg l and ni and cd 17 mg l and 8 mg l respectively similar to the río tinto ones obtained from this work analysis that at 0 45 μm show concentrations of metals up to thousand times higher than in natural waters 1 7 g l al 1 3 g l fe 13 9 mg l co 7 1 mg l cu and 9 2 mg l zn concerning non acidic waters guéguen and dominik 2003 reported concentrations in upper vistula river separating the 1 kda fraction from the truly dissolved fraction in the waters for ph 7 2 7 8 fe is even no detectable in water because all of it is associated to the retentate fractions while co cu and zn range in 0 24 2 94 μg l 0 6 82 1 μg l and 13 2 162 0 μg l respectively ross and sherrell 1999 studied an area in new jersey pinelands and in bass river filtrating sampled waters at 10 kda for the lowest ph detected 4 55 they reported concentrations of 30 μg l for al 65 μg l for fe 0 1 μg l for cu and 3 8 μg l for zn guo et al 2000a found that levels of trace metals cu pb zn cd co ni cr be fe al mn v ba and ti in marine colloids 1 kda 0 20 μm ranged from 0 1 to 50 μg g colloidal matter except for fe which generally had a concentration 120 μg g besides data on dissolved and colloidal trace element concentration were determined in the estuaries which represents complex systems in which biogeochemical processes take place and influence elements pathway dai and martin 1995 reported trace metal concentrations in the obi and yenisey river estuary systems dissolved cd and pb are in the order of pg l cu and ni do not reach 1 μg l and dissolved fe range is 0 5 2 5 μg l while retentate cd and pb values again are negligible retained ni is in the order of ng l cu 0 92 1 56 μg l and retained fe 17 2 23 1 μg l 3 2 uranium behaviour u concentration in 0 45 μm filtered water is 36 45 μg l while in 0 20 μm filtered water are 34 52 μg l this little decrease matches the 5 of u associated to the 0 45 0 20 μm fraction the range of u concentration in the ultrafiltered samples is 17 37 40 73 μg l with an average of 34 22 μg l samples show no significant differences among them but the general trend is toward lower values for the permeate fraction meaning that u can be retained by the membranes uranium average concentration in seawater is 3 3 ppb e g ku et al 1977 while in common surface waters it presents temporal and spatial variability strongly dependent on the local redox conditions plater et al 1992 but still predominantly in the order of ng l as documented in swarzenski et al 1995 andersson et al 2001 or guo et al 2007 u concentration in río tinto was already shown by casas ruiz and barbero 2015 that reported values up to 200 μg l at ph 2 5 after 0 45 μm filtering the extreme elevated u concentration results from acidic conditions of the study area that lead to the mobilization of high levels of natural radionuclides furthermore the area is characterized by acidic volcanoclastic rocks into which u is naturally partitioned that under amd conditions suffer the continuous dissolution of minerals and the subsequent release of the associated elements into the waters evidences of this are shown by high correlations r2 0 99 between u and all the investigated elements which confirms that u could derived from the dissolution of aluminosilicates of the acidic volcanic lithologies present in the area río tinto carries a high concentration of u that under these conditions ph 2 3 would remain in solution either as uranil or as uranium sulphate or bisulfate complexes soluble species u will be significantly scavenged when a change in ph induce co precipitation of u and other dissolved metals as metallic hydroxides or sulphate salts this process is mainly evident when abrupt changes of ph ocurr when river water mixes with the estuarine water and ph increases to 4 hierro et al 2012 3 3 uranium isotopes behaviour 234u 238u activity ratios ar disequilibrium in natural waters is related to the recoil process which causes preferent release of 234u as the decay product of 238u disintegration from the solid into the solution and the perturbation of the crystal lattice where 238u was located this lead to the preferential leaching of 234u respect to 238u as this process is time depended the study of u series disequilibrium represents an excellent tool and a chronometer of weathering processes furthermore during water rock interactions and their transport in solution each of other nuclides of the u series behave differently than u for instance th 230th is the daughter of 234u is known to be a very insoluble element for ph 3 this variability led to significant geochemical fractionation among these nuclides since except in highly reducing or highly ligand rich solutions fluid phase will be generally enriched in u and the residual solid phases in th chabeaux et al 2008 the accuracy and precision of the instruments used resulted in about 2 consistent with the typical bias of spectroscopy methods of investigation that is usually as high as 2 data on 234u 238u ar in surface natural water and groundwater are abundant in the literature e g osmond and cowart 1976 sarin et al 1990 kronfeld and vogel 1991 andersson et al 1995 porcelli et al 1997 rivers typically show 234u 238u 1 while groundwater usually show much higher 234u 238u ratios borole et al 1982 reviewed available u isotopes data in world rivers and estimated a 234u 238u ar weighted mean amounting to 1 20 0 06 calculated 234u 238u activity ratios on collected water in río tinto samples are in a range of 2 29 0 15 to 2 53 0 15 with no systematic variation previous works in río tinto waters registered a 234u 238u ar ranging between 1 5 and 3 0 ketterer et al 2011 here the highest values were explained as a consequence of the acid drainage that preferentially lixiviates 234u relative to 238u from minerals in the mining areas the 234u 238u ar should be close to unity when the complete dissolution of the solid matrix occurs barbero et al 2014 so this is not the case another acid mine drainage case that could be compared with río tinto one is the ogoya mine one in japan where tedori and kakehashi rivers waters show a 234u 238u ar around 3 1 yamamoto et al 2010 here the authors assigned the exceptional high 234u 238u ar values up to 16 8 1 8 founded in samples closest to the mine zone to the deeper underground water having high 234u concentration due to preferential leaching of 234u under neutral and reducing conditions 234u 238u ar average reported from this work amount to 2 42 0 24 consistent with further results concerning dissolved matter from río tinto water exposed by hierro et al 2013 2 2 0 1 this disequilibrium is imputable to the excess of 234u related both to the recoil effect enhanced by the weathering that leads to a reduction in the grain size and to the preferential lixiviation conducted by acidic water the activities of the u isotopes vary in the range 0 01 1 25 bq l with 235u activity concentration that could be considered irrelevant since its highest value is 0 02 bq l 238u activity varies between 0 22 and 0 51 bq l while 234u show values between 0 50 and 1 25 bq l 3 4 permeation model on the basis of the permeation model expressed by the equation for a straight line y ax b it can be possible to calculate pc value from the slope and estimate the amount of the retention for that chemical species at each uf cycle furthermore cf 0 can be derived from the combination of the intercept b and the pc value using exp b pc while using the estimated cf 0 the initial colloidal fraction can be predicted as 1 cf 0 ct 0 where ct 0 is the measured total dissolved concentration guo and santschi 1996 guo et al 2000b 3 4 1 heavy metals cd cr and ni concentrations are lower than the detection limits so it was not possible to develop a permeation model for them the rest of the investigated metals al co cu fe an zn exhibit similar permeation behaviour with permeation coefficients pc from the first experiment 50 kda ultrafiltration of 0 96 for al and fe and 0 97 for co cu and zn fig 3 this suggests that for each uf cycle the 50 kda membrane let 96 97 of lmw elements to pass through it and 3 are retained as compounds with a molecular size higher than 50 kda despite the high abundance of suspended matter in this acid mine drainage waters analyses are usually performed on water sample normally filtered at 0 20 μm or 0 45 μm membrane filters e g sánchez españa et al 2005 with no further filtering the model estimates that around 2 8 of these metals are associated to 50 kda colloidal fraction demonstrating that up to 8 of the concentration of these metals in a traditional 0 20 μm filtration is associated to the 50 kda colloidal fraction concentrations estimated by the model for the 50 kda filtered water are 1440 50 mg l for al 11 31 mg l for co 5 41 mg l for cu 10 417 59 mg l for fe and 7 61 mg l for zn lower permeation values arise from the other two experiments fig 4 and fig 5 pc 0 86 0 88 for 10 kda membrane and 0 82 0 86 for 3 kda membrane with a two fold increase in the percentage of the fraction associated to colloids 15 21 here the estimated concentrations are 1250 57 mg l 9 72 mg l 4 64 mg l 9031 90 mg l and 6 67 mg l for al co cu fe and zn respectively in the 10 kda filtered water samples while for the 3 kda filtered water concentrations are 1243 94 mg l 10 13 mg l 4 81 mg l 9159 34 mg l and 6 83 mg l for the same elements it can be observed that these elements show similar behaviour in both 10 kda and 3 kda experiments which indicates that they are not associated to the 3 kda colloid fraction so 10 kda is the smallest size in which it is possible to find metals associated to colloids and they possibly contribute up to 21 in the concentration of the element in the water 3 4 2 uranium the application of the permeation model for u contents in the permeate samples explains the behaviour of the lmw u interacting with the three membranes the constant permeation coefficients are pc 0 95 for 50 kda membrane pc 0 86 through 10 kda membrane and pc 0 80 for the 3 kda experiment figs 3 5 this implies that for each uf cycle the 50 kda membrane retains 5 as compounds with a molecular size higher than 50 kda while the 10 kda membrane retains 14 of u finally the 3 kda membrane retains up to 20 of the dissolved u previous results about u behaviour ultrafiltered at 5 kda gave values of pc 0 847 casas ruiz and barbero 2015 so the permeation behaviour of u resulting from this work experiments can be considered coherent with previous results casas ruiz and barbero 2015 showed that the permeation model estimated around 9 of u associated to 5 kda colloidal fraction from this work it was obtained 5 17 and 23 of u associated to 50 10 and 3 kda fraction respectively values estimated from the model are 31 65 μg l 27 47 μg l and 25 46 μg l for 50 kda 10 kda and 3 kda respectively 3 4 3 uranium isotopes considering the 234 235 and 238 u isotopes they show results really similar to the one obtained for the concentration of u demonstrating no differences in the behaviour and similar percentages in the colloidal fraction fig 6 as expected for 234u the permeation coefficients are 0 97 0 87 and 0 79 for the 50 kda 10 kda and 3 kda uf experiment respectively while for 235u and 238u they are the same 0 95 0 86 and 0 80 for 50 kda 10 kda and 3 kda membrane respectively this means that the uf does not affect the isotope fractionation since isotopes just differ in neutron number and exhibit identical chemical behaviour this is also confirmed by the percentage of the three isotopes in the colloidal fraction 4 16 and 25 of 234u associated to the 50 kda 10 kda and 3 kda fraction 5 19 and 23 of 235u associated to the 50 kda 10 kda and 3 kda fraction and 5 17 and 23 of 238u in the 50 kda 10 kda and 3 kda fraction respectively in particular 238u reflects exactly the same results of u element 3 5 recovery an alternative classic method to calculate percentage of elements associated to the colloidal fraction considers the measurements of the volume of all the fraction involved in each uf experiment and allows an accurate mass balance that is critical even not very sensitive to assess the recovery of the uf experiments guo and santschi 1996 the mass balance is obtained using the following equation recovery cp vp cr vr c 0 v 0 100 where cp cr and c0 are the measured concentration in the permeate retentate and initial solution respectively and vp vr and v0 are the respective volumes involved in the uf experiments in table 1 it can be observed that recoveries for u and zn result excellent 95 115 for al co cu and fe they are reasonably good with recoveries of 90 99 and up to 110 for the 3 kda experiments suggesting that this membrane exhibits minimal contamination and processing losses in contrast recovery from samples from lower cf reveals large losses of elements during uf experiments mainly 80 it might be due to low cfs that seem to be inadequate to extract the elements and render a permeate that will be representative of their actual permeation behaviour previous works mention artifact retention of the dissolved species at low cfs due to the retention of lmw molecules during uf that leads to an overestimation of the elements associated to the colloidal fraction guo et al 2000b 2007 losses of the elements might be due to the nature of them whose dissolved form is positive charged and physicochemical interactions with the uf membranes which in general are negatively charged with the consequent retention of the element onto the membrane surface or pores 4 conclusions the acid mine drainage environment of río tinto area promotes the presence of heavy metals and uranium in solution chemical characterization of stream water is usually performed on samples filtered at 0 45 μm or 0 20 μm without considering colloidal fraction contribution compared to common natural waters concentrations of all elements are at least three orders of magnitude higher the high values of the measurements were expected because of the nature of acid mine drainage condition u derives from the dissolution of aluminosilicates contained in the acidic volcanic rocks of the area via chemical weathering under amd conditions the solid phases being dissolved and releasing heavy metals so4 2 and acidity into the water a good correlation between u and elements such as al and zn was found suggesting that this radionuclide derives from leaching of the host rock 238u activity varies between 0 22 and 0 51 bq l while 234u show values between 0 50 and 1 25 bq l leading to 234u 238u activity ratios range between 2 29 0 15 and 2 53 0 15 the disequilibrium is attributable to the excess of 234u related both to the recoil effect and the acidic water preferentially lixiviates 234u respect to 238u from minerals in the mining areas there is no systematic variation between the different size fractions and no isotopic fractionation with respect to elemental u distribution between the different phases as isotopes of the same element are expected to exhibit a similar chemically behaviour uf experiments for different membrane pore sizes and distinct cf allow the construction a permeation model to interpret the size fractionation data properly throughout the río tinto although investigated species will exist in dissolved form a significant fraction of them could be associated to colloids the models estimate 7 8 of al co cu and fe associated to the 50 kda colloidal fraction 19 21 of them associated to the 10 kda colloidal fraction while just 2 of zn is associated to the 50 kda fraction and 15 in the 10 kda colloids colloidal u amounts to 5 and 17 for 50 kda and 10 kda respectively it can be observed that there is not an increase in the values of estimated colloidal fraction with decreasing of the pore size from 10 to 3 kda due to the absence of colloids 10 kda except for u whose 3 kda colloidal form shows contributions up to 23 to the u concentration in water recovery is excellent although it seems that low cf are inadequate to extract the elements and to obtain a permeate that will be representative of their actual permeation behaviour this could be due to interactions between the negatively charged membrane and the positive charged elements in future work it would be important to characterize the nature of the colloidal material for each size membrane experiment in order to validate this scenario and to understand how colloids composition affects the partitioning of elements from the solution acknowledgments this work is included in the

particle tracking rwpt and kernel density estimator kde in the aem rwpt kde model aem solves the groundwater flow equation rwpt solves the advection dispersion reaction equation and kde enhances the accuracy and computational efficiency of rwpt aem generates a continuous velocity distribution which is suitable for rwpt an analytic expression is modified to simulate radioactive decay for discrete transport time steps and is embedded in the rwpt model linear adsorption is also incorporated in the rwpt model by tracking particles with a retarded velocity unlike eulerian transport models such as finite element or finite difference methods rwpt is completely free from numerical dispersion the comparison of results illustrates the superiority of the rwpt model over accurate eulerian lagrangian

introduction the transport processes of conservative groundwater solutes are usually modeled by considering two mechanisms i e advection and hydrodynamic dispersion bear and cheng 2010 with non conservative solutes the solute may degrade radioactive decay or biodegradation or mass transfer of solutes adsorption can take place between the liquid and solid portions of groundwater systems batu 2005 kresic 2007 sudicky et al 2013 subsurface solute transport is usually predicted by simulating the groundwater flow and the advection dispersion reaction equation adre numerical simulation techniques such as the finite difference fdm and the finite element method fem are commonly applied for groundwater flow simulations bear and cheng 2010 boddula and eldho 2018 the aem is also quite popular for groundwater flow simulation as it has many advantages over fdm and fem strack 1989 haitjema 1995 the hydraulic head or velocity generated by aem is a spatially continuous function and aem computes the hydraulic head or velocity with great accuracy on the contrary fdm and fem compute the hydraulic head only at the nodes to compute the hydraulic head at any location using fdm or fem the hydraulic head is interpolated from the nodal hydraulic head values in the fdm or fem the interpolation of velocities may lead to discontinuity in the velocity at the edge of the element majumder and eldho 2016a 2016b in short a flow simulation model developed by aem is more continuous and accurate than fdm or fem the accuracy of the flow simulation model directly impacts the accuracy of the transport simulation model craig and rabideau 2006a 2006b however one of the limitations of aem is that it is mainly suitable to simulate steady state groundwater flow matott et al 2006 strack 1989 obtaining the solution of transient flow using aem can be computationally expensive and may require a lot of assumptions to simplify the problem bakker 2009 2004 fitts 2010 2002 furman and neuman 2003 haitjema and strack 1985 kuhlman and neuman 2008 zaadnoordijk 1990 however the steady state flow assumption is not a major limitation for most contaminant transport simulations contaminant transport through the subsurface is generally a very slow process hence short term transience in groundwater flow can often be neglected craig and rabideau 2006a 2006b frind and matanga 1985 kuo et al 1992 matott et al 2006 the eulerian approaches such as fdm and fem methods are the most common choice for contaminant transport simulation for advection dominated contaminant transport problems the eulerian transport models fdm or fem and hybrid eulerian lagrangian methods method of characteristics moc hybrid method of characteristics hmoc are susceptible to the numerical dispersion error caused by truncation of the spatial derivative terms of the adre majumder and eldho 2016a zheng and wang 1999 among the eulerian approaches the combined use of third order total variation diminishing tvd schemes for advection and implicit finite difference method for dispersion is the most accurate scheme harten 1983 yee 1987 zheng and wang 1999 alternatively contaminant transport processes can be simulated by lagrangian approaches such as random walk particle tracking rwpt herrera et al 2009 majumder and eldho 2016a in rwpt a finite number of particles are used to discretize the contaminant mass and in each transport time step particles move through the subsurface by advection hydrodynamic dispersion and chemical reaction kinzelbach 1986 furthermore in rwpt there is no numerical dispersion salamon et al 2006 majumder and eldho 2016a applied a vectorised aem rwpt model to simulate groundwater flow and contaminant processes through heterogeneous aquifers the aem rwpt model satisfies the global local solute mass balance condition with greater accuracy than fdm or fem based models the accuracy and efficiency of the rwpt model can be significantly enhanced by coupling it with kernel density estimator kde härdle 2009 loader 1999 rahbaralam et al 2015 silverman 1986 kde is the most popular non parametric way to estimate the probability density function pdf of random variables botev et al 2010 rahbaralam et al 2015 however the performance of kde depends on optimal bandwidth which is very difficult to compute härdle 2009 heidenreich et al 2013 carried out an extensive review on the selection of bandwidth for kde and they found that a mixture of cross validation methods and simple plug in generates stable bandwidth however the availability of various kde based software packages has made it easier to apply it to contaminant transport simulation the aem rwpt model of majumder and eldho 2016a can simulate only advection and hydrodynamic dispersion first order chemical reaction radioactive decay and linear adsorption can also be simulated using rwpt kinzelbach 1986 proposed approaches to implement radioactive decay and linear adsorption in rwpt however the proposed methodologies have never been used at the case study level in this study a simulation model is proposed to solve two dimensional groundwater flow and advection dispersion reaction equation using aem rwpt and kde two different types of contaminants are examined in examples in this study the first one is radionuclide radium 228 and the other is trichloroethene tce with radium 228 the transport occurs by three mechanisms i e advection hydrodynamic dispersion and radioactive decay with tce the transport occurs by advection hydrodynamic dispersion and linear adsorption 2 methodology the steady state groundwater flow equation can be presented as bear and cheng 2010 1 k ϕ q s where k is hydraulic conductivity lt 1 ϕ is hydraulic head l q s is the sink source t 1 the seepage velocity can be computed by darcy s law bear and cheng 2010 2 u i k n p ϕ x i in the above expression n p is the porosity and u is the seepage velocity lt 1 contaminant transport processes can be represented by the advection dispersion reaction equation adre as bear and cheng 2010 kinzelbach 1986 sun and sun 2013 3 r d c t d c uc r d λ d c where c is contaminant concentration ml 3 t is time t λ d is the decay constant t 1 r d is the retardation coefficient dimensionless d ij is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient l2 t 1 which can be expressed as bear and cheng 2010 4 d ij α t u δ ij α l α t u i u j u d ij m δ ij 1 for i j 0 for i j where δ ij is the kronecker delta α t is the transverse dispersivity l α l is the longitudinal dispersivity l u i and u j is the seepage velocity in the ith and jth directions lt 1 u is the seepage velocity vector d ij m is the effective molecular diffusion coefficient in this paper aem is used to solve eq 1 and rwpt is used to solve eq 3 a brief description of aem and rwpt is presented below 2 1 analytic element method aem in the aem hydrological features such as pumping injection wells rivers and inhomogeneities are represented by analytic element functions there are elements for points wells lines rivers linear boundaries and areas recharge leakage in aem only the boundary of the domain is discretized but not the whole domain the model in aem can be expressed in terms of the discharge potential the discharge potential φ for confined and unconfined aquifer cases can be expressed as batista et al 2012 steward 2015 steward and allen 2013 5a φ kh ϕ b 1 2 k h 2 if ϕ b h 5b φ 1 2 k ϕ b 2 if ϕ b h where h is the aquifer thickness l ϕ is the hydraulic head and b is the aquifer base elevation l detailed explanations of the aem can be found in haitjema 1995 and strack 1989 2017 2 2 random walk particle tracking rwpt rwpt is a lagrangian approach to simulate the advection dispersion reaction equation in rwpt a finite number of particles are used to represent contaminant mass the particles move through the subsurface by three mechanisms advection hydrodynamic dispersion and chemical reaction paster et al 2014 the movement of each particle can be represented by the ito taylor integration scheme as majumder and eldho 2016a robinson et al 2010 srinivasan et al 2010 2012 sun et al 2015 6a x t δt x t u x d xx x d xy y δt r 1 2 d xx δt r 2 2 d xy δt 6b y t δt y t u y d yx x d yy y δt r 3 2 d yx δt r 4 2 d yy δt where x t δt y t δt is the particle s position at the time t δt l x t y t is the particle s position at the time t l u x and u y are the components of seepage velocity in x and y direction respectively lt 1 and r i is the gaussian distribution with unit variance and zero mean the partial derivatives of the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient in eq 6 can be computed following sun et al 2015 after moving the particles using eq 6 the contaminant concentration at any point circular area can be computed as majumder and eldho 2016a 7 c x y t n c m nπ r 2 h n p where c x y t is the concentration at the centre x y of the circle ml 3 n is the total number of particles representing contaminant mass of m amount n c is the number of particles within the circular area r is the radius of the circle l h is the thickness normal to the plane of the model l and n p is the porosity of the medium 2 3 radioactive decay decay of a radioactive material with respect to time can be expressed as batu 2005 8 a t a 0 e λ d δt in the above expression a t is the concentration of a reactant a at time t t a 0 is the concentration of a reactant a at time t 0 and λ d is the decay constant for incompressible fluids the above eq 8 is also valid for contaminant mass kinzelbach 1986 in terms of contaminant mass the above equation can also be expressed as kinzelbach 1986 9 m t m 0 e λ d δt where m 0 is the contaminant mass at time t 0 m t is the contaminant mass at time t for discrete time steps t 1 2 3 n with time interval δt we can write 9a m 1 m 0 e λ d δt 9b m 2 m 1 e λ d δt m 0 e λ d δt e λ d δt m 0 e λ d δt 2 9c m 3 m 2 e λ d δt m 0 e λ d δt 3 9d m i m i 1 e λ d δt m 0 e λ d δt i thus in rwpt for first order reactive transport the contaminant mass reduces with respect to transport time step following eq 9d a long list of radionuclides with their half life t 1 2 can be found in batu 2005 from the half life of the radionuclide s the decay constant λ d can be computed as batu 2005 10 λ d 0 6931 t 1 2 2 4 linear adsorption isotherm the linear adsorption isotherm can be incorporated in rwpt by replacing the pore velocity u with a retarded velocity u r d the particles will be tracked with the retarded velocity u r d for the entire transport time period the retardation coefficient r d can be computed as batu 2005 11 r d 1 ρ b n p k d in the above equation ρ b is the dry bulk density n p is the porosity and k d is the distribution coefficient sorption constant 2 5 kernel density estimation kde in statistics kde is a non parametric way of computing a probability density function pdf of random variables härdle 2009 silverman 1986 it has been widely used in various inference procedures such as reactive contaminant transport simulation data mining signal processing pattern recognition machine learning and computer vision guidoum 2015 rahbaralam et al 2015 by using kde the results of rwpt simulations can be further improved the pdf of the particle time history can be obtained by kde as pedretti and fernàndez garcia 2013 12 p x y t 1 n i 1 n 1 h b k t t i h b where p x y t is the pdf of the particle time history in the fixed location x y at varying time t h b is the bandwidth of the kernel smoothing function n is the total number of the time interval t i is the ith time interval the kernel smoothing function k must satisfy the following condition guidoum 2015 härdle 2009 13a k t t i h b dt 1 13b k t t i h b 0 there are many types of kernel functions such as gaussian epanechnikov bi weight triangular rectangular and so forth silverman 1986 in this study we have used the gaussian kernel which can be expressed as 14 k t t i h b 1 h b 2 π exp t t i 2 2 h b 2 the concentrations at a particular point with respect to time can be computed from the pdf p x y t as 15 c x y t m p x y t t 0 t n n t nπ r 2 h n p where c x y t is the concentration in a fixed location x y at time t n is the total number of particles representing contaminant mass of m amount h is the thickness of aquifer n t is the number of particles inside the control volume at time t hence t 0 t n n t is the summation of the number of particles starting from time interval t 0 to t n inside the control volume 2 5 1 selection of optimal bandwidth the choice of optimal bandwidth h b is a critical aspect for efficient use of kde a very low value of bandwidth h b causes spurious fluctuations in the probability density function pdf estimate and a high value of bandwidth h b causes excessive smoothing of the pdf härdle 2009 loader 1999 the optimal bandwidth h b opt can be computed as fernàndez garcia and sanchez vila 2011 rahbaralam et al 2015 16 h b opt r n 1 5 17 r k 2 2 p t 2 2 μ 2 k 2 1 5 in the above equation p t is the 2nd derivative of the concentration normalized by total contaminant mass in the system μ 2 k is the second moment of k 2 2 is the l 2 norm operator commonly used bandwidth h b selection methods are rule of thumb plug in methods and cross validation guidoum 2015 härdle 2009 silverman 1986 botev et al 2010 proposed kernel density estimation via diffusion they proposed a new plug in bandwidth selection method which does not require the assumption that the data are normally distributed botev et al 2010 claimed the superiority of new plug in bandwidth selection method over all existing approaches in this study we have directly used a matlab function given by botev et al 2010 for kernel density estimation 3 model development initially the aem rwpt model is developed following majumder and eldho 2016a to improve the efficiency and accuracy it is combined with the kernel density estimator kde in addition to advection and hydrodynamic dispersion the aem rwpt kde model is able to simulate radioactive decay and linear adsorption the steps to combine aem rwpt with kde to simulate first order chemical reaction and linear adsorption are given below 3 1 steps to enhance the rwpt model by combining it with kde i from the aem rwpt model obtain the number of particles inside a control volume in different time steps t i t 1 t 2 t 3 t i t n ii suppose at time t i the total number of particles inside the control volume is n i generate a vector vt i of dimension 1 n i the vector vt i will be v t i i 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 where i 1 n iii repeat step ii for all the time intervals concatenate all the vectors the concatenated vector will look like vt 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 n n n n iv using eq 12 compute the probability density function p x y t of the particle time series data at the control volume we assumed the kernel as gaussian the bandwidth h b is selected following a new plug in bandwidth selection method proposed by botev et al 2010 v from the probability density function p x y t the concentration c i at the center of a control volume can be computed easily using eq 15 3 2 steps to simulate first order chemical reaction using aem rwpt kde model in continuation of the steps mentioned above the following are the additional steps to incorporate radioactive decay i from the half life of the radionuclide compute the decay constant using eq 10 ii assume the contaminant mass m 0 as 1 unit normalized mass and obtain the expressions of m i using eq 9d where i 1 2 3 n and m i is a vector of normalized mass which shows the exponential decay of radionuclide with respect to time iii obtain the product c i c i m i here c i is the contaminant concentration due to advection hydrodynamic dispersion and radioactive decay a flowchart depicting aem rwpt kde model is shown in fig 1 4 model validation and sensitivity analysis for an impulse contaminant injection from a point source the two dimensional analytic solution due to advection hydrodynamic dispersion radioactive decay and linear adsorption can be expressed as harten 1983 kinzelbach 1986 18 c x y t c 0 a 4 πt d xx d yy exp λ d t x x 0 u x r d t 2 4 d xx t y y 0 2 4 d yy t in the above equation the flow is uniform in the x direction here c 0 is the initial contaminant concentration ml 3 a is contaminant source area l2 x 0 y 0 is the center of the contaminant source l d xx d yy are the longitudinal and transverse dispersion l2 t 1 λ d is the decay constant of the radionuclide and r d is the retardation coefficient in the following sub sections a comparative study is carried out to understand the influence of kde on rwpt solution quality further an analysis is carried out to comprehend the performance of the rwpt kde model for the advection dominated problem considering advection hydrodynamic dispersion and radioactive decay the rwpt kde model is validated against the analytical solution eq 18 r d is assumed as 1 in this case furthermore assuming λ d 0 and considering advection hydrodynamic dispersion and linear adsorption the rwpt kde model is validated against an analytical solution here a hypothetical homogeneous isotropic confined aquifer as given in majumder and eldho 2016a is considered to carry out the above mentioned analysis following are the aquifer parameters seepage velocity u x in the longitudinal direction is 0 5 m day porosity n p of the medium is 0 3 dispersivity α l α t in both longitudinal and transverse directions is 0 1 m here it is also assumed that a contaminant mass of 10 g is instantaneously injected at point a x 0 5 m y 0 8 m over an area of 0 01 m 0 01 m fig 2 4 1 performance of rwpt kde model here the performance of the rwpt kde model is assessed against the rwpt model to induce enough oscillations in the computed concentrations a very small time step δt 0 1 day and small radius of control volume r 0 1 m is assumed for the rwpt model also the number of particles n to represent contaminant mass was 0 1 million the contaminant concentration at point b fig 2 is evaluated by analytical solution rwpt and rwpt kde model in fig 3 it can be seen that the breakthrough curve btc obtained by rwpt kde model is very close to the analytical solution whereas the btc obtained by rwpt oscillates a lot here it is observed that the kde smooths and improves the solution quality of rwpt model hence the rwpt kde model is a superior concentration estimation technique compared to the rwpt model 4 2 performance of rwpt kde model for advection dominated problem many field problems are advection dominated and the dimensionless peclet number pe is used to ensure accuracy of numerical simulation craig and rabideau 2006a 2006b the peclet number pe can be expressed as huyakorn 1983 zheng and wang 1999 19 pe u δl d ij in the above expression u is the magnitude of seepage velocity vector δl is the characteristic length and d ij is the dispersion coefficient tensor eq 4 in one dimensional transport δl δx and in two dimensional transport δl max δx δy here δx and δy are the grid sizes along x and y direction the contaminant transport process of the above mentioned problem fig 2 is simulated by the highly accurate fdm tvd scheme zheng and wang 1999 for varying peclet number pe 2 5 25 100 200 different peclet numbers are obtained by varying the longitudinal α l and transverse dispersivity α t as α l α t 0 1 m α l α t 0 01 m α l α t 0 0025 m α l α t 0 00125 m other aquifer parameters are kept as same as in the previous section the btcs are generated at point b by three methods analytical solution fdm tvd scheme and rwpt kde method fig 4 the transport time step δt is assumed as 0 25 days for fdm tvd scheme the grid size is 0 25 m 0 25 m for rwpt simulation the radius of the circular grid is 0 25 m from the figure it can be seen that for peclet number 2 5 the btcs obtained at point b by the three methods are very close even for higher peclet numbers pe 25 100 200 the btcs generated by rwpt kde are close to the analytical solution on the contrary the btcs generated by the tvd schemes have noticeable deviation from the analytical solution with increase in peclet number for the tvd schemes the discrepancy is due to numerical dispersion caused by truncation error and concentration averaging due to higher grid size the rwpt kde shows no numerical dispersion with an increase in peclet number as expected for this method hence it can be concluded that the rwpt kde is completely free from numerical dispersion a similar analysis is carried out to comprehend the contaminant transport processes again by three methods analytical solution fdm method of characteristics moc and rwpt fig 5 as can be seen from fig 5 rwpt kde is more accurate than fdm moc which is also prone to numerical dispersion for an advection dominated problem 4 3 validation of rwpt kde model for simulation of advection dispersion reaction equation radioactive decay case the rwpt kde model for radioactive decay is validated by applying it to a hypothetical problem as shown in fig 2 here it is assumed that 10 g of a radionuclide is instantaneously injected at point a over an area of 0 01 m 0 01 m fig 2 the decay constant λ d of the radionuclide is 0 02 per day the transport is simulated analytically by using eq 18 and numerically by rwpt kde assuming r d 1 in eq 18 btcs are also generated for λ d 0 and λ d 0 01 the btcs generated at the observation point b are shown in fig 6 it can also be seen that the btc generated by rwpt kde closely matches the analytic solution the rwpt kde simulation is carried out by considering 0 1 million particles here the transport time step δt is assumed as 1 day and radius of the circle r over which concentrations have to be computed as 0 25 m the sensitivity analysis of those parameters can be found in majumder and eldho 2016a so we are not repeating it here 4 4 validation of rwpt kde model for simulation of advection dispersion reaction equation linear adsorption case here the retardation coefficient r d is assumed as 2 24 and λ d 0 no radioactive decay btcs are generated at point b analytically using eq 18 for the rwpt kde simulation it is assumed that particle moves at a retarded velocity u r d instead of u the velocity u r d is used to compute the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient tensor the btc generated by rwpt kde is similar to the analytical solution fig 7 5 model applications here we simulated contaminant transport processes of two hypothetical aquifers using aem rwpt kde model 5 1 case study 1 two different contaminant transport conditions are considered for case study 1 in the first case it is assumed that the contaminant is a radionuclide radium 228 in this case contaminant transport is taking place via three mechanisms advection hydrodynamic dispersion and radioactive decay in the second case the contaminant is trichloroethene tce the tce undergoes linear adsorption in addition to advection and hydrodynamic dispersion 5 1 1 reactive contaminant transport modeling assuming the contaminant as radium 228 this case study considers a hypothetical heterogeneous unconfined aquifer fig 8 the thickness of the aquifer is 60 m in the aquifer there is a rectangular inhomogeneity domain the hydraulic conductivity inside the inhomogeneity domain is 1 m day and the background hydraulic conductivity is 4 m day recharge of the aquifer is 0 001 m day it is assumed that 1 kg of radium 228 is instantaneously sprinkled over an areal source 50 m 50 m as shown in fig 8 the aquifer parameters and associated boundary condition are shown in table 1 and fig 8 aem is used to represent various aquifer features the constant head boundary is discretized into several line sink elements strack 1989 the no flow boundary is assumed as a polygon with zero hydraulic conductivity and each side of the polygon is represented by a higher order line doublet janković and barnes 1999 a polygonal areal sink having constant strength strack 1989 is used to represent recharge the half life of radium 228 is 5 8 years and the decay constant λ d is 3 2739 10 4 per day 0 1 million particles are used to represent 1 kg of radium 228 it is assumed that the transport time step δt is 1 day and radius r of the control volume over which concentration has to be computed is 10 m the btcs are generated at point p1 p2 p3 p4 fig 8 by the aem rwpt kde model and shown in fig 9 btcs are also generated using modflow mt3d and they are found to be similar to those obtained by rwpt kde btcs are also generated assuming no radioactive decay the distribution of the contaminant concentrations at different stress periods second year fourth year sixth year eight year obtained by aem rwpt kde model are shown in fig 10 this figure shows the practical application of aem rwpt kde model to simulate contaminant transport processes of a hypothetical unconfined aquifer considering advection hydrodynamic dispersion and first order chemical reaction 5 1 2 reactive contaminant transport modeling assuming the contaminant as trichloroethene tce instead of the radionuclide here it is assumed that the contaminant is tce it is assumed that 1 kg of tce is instantaneously released over an areal source 50 m 50 m as shown in fig 8 the dry bulk density ρ b of the porous media is assumed as 1 86 g cm3 the distribution coefficient k d of the tce is 0 20 cm3 g batu 2005 the retardation coefficient r d is computed using eq 11 by keeping other hydraulic parameters same as in the previous section the transport processes are simulated using rwpt kde the btcs generated at point p1 p2 p3 p4 using aem rwpt kde model are shown in fig 11 further btcs are also obtained by modflow mt3d the btcs obtained by both methods are quite similar the distribution of the contaminant concentrations at different stress periods second year fourth year sixth year eight year are shown in fig 12 the aem rwpt kde model is capable of simulating combined advection dispersion and linear adsorption of the contaminant as demonstrated in this case study 5 2 case study 2 here aem rwpt kde model is applied to simulate contaminant transport processes of a complex hypothetical unconfined aquifer as shown in fig 13 this case study is structurally similar to one of the case study reported in majumder and eldho 2016a however some of the aquifer parameters and contamination is assumed suitably all the aquifer parameters and boundary conditions are given in table 2 and fig 13 the aquifer has three zones of varying hydraulic conductivity hydraulic conductivity in zone 1 zone 2 and zone 3 are 20 m d 25 m d 30 m d respectively the transport process of the aquifer is advection dominated due to high hydraulic conductivity values the aquifer has many complex hydrogeological features such as inhomogeneity domains no flow boundary constant flux boundary seepage from a pond groundwater recharge and a stream the stream is discretized into several segments and each segment is represented by head specified line sinks the constant flux boundary is also discretized into several segments and each segment is represented by an extraction specified line sink inhomogeneity domains and a no flow boundary are represented by higher order line doublets also it is assumed that 150 kg of radium is accidently spilled instantaneous injection over a pond as shown in fig 13 representing the contaminant mass by 0 1 million particles the transport simulation is carried out for 20 years using aem rwpt kde model the btcs are generated at points p1 p2 p3 p4 by aem rwpt kde model and they are found to be closely similar with the btcs generated by a comparable modflow mt3d model fig 14 the spatial distribution of concentrations obtained by aem rwpt kde model at the end of ten and twenty years are shown in fig 15 the case study depicts the success of aem rwpt kde model in simulating reactive contaminant transport modeling with in a complex hypothetical aquifer system such kind of complexities may arise in simulating flow and transport processes of real field aquifers hence this case study demonstrates the potential applicability of proposed aem rwpt kde model in simulating a real field aquifer problem 6 discussion the present study proposes the aem rwpt kde simulation model to solve groundwater flow and advection dispersion reaction equations for the same number of particles the aem rwpt kde model computes contaminant concentrations more precisely than the aem rwpt model which is one of the major contributions of the proposed methodology additionally the aem rwpt kde model is able to simulate radioactive decay and linear adsorption in addition to advection and hydrodynamic dispersion also it is shown that for advection dominated transport the rwpt kde model does not introduce numerical dispersion unlike fdm or fem for a hypothetical confined aquifer the btc generated by a rwpt kde model considering advection hydrodynamic dispersion and radioactive decay is verified against an analytical solution the aem rwpt kde model is successfully applied to simulate the groundwater flow and reactive contaminant transport radioactive decay and linear adsorption of two hypothetical heterogeneous aquifer systems there are a few limitations of the proposed methodology the use of aem to simulate highly heterogeneous media is still limited aem is mostly suitable to simulate piecewise hydraulic conductivity variations fitts 2010 however some recent developments in aem are encouraging such as use of laplace transform aem to simulate transient groundwater flow processes and use of aem to simulate harmonically heterogeneous media craig 2009 kuhlman and neuman 2008 also using finite difference time steps allows anaqsim to simulate general groundwater transient flows fitts 2010 7 conclusions the aem rwpt kde model is proposed to solve groundwater flow and advection dispersion reaction equations aem computes continuous head and velocity information hence it is amenable for rwpt simulation additionally kde enhances the accuracy of the concentrations predicted by rwpt model eulerian transport models such as fdm and fem are prone to numerical dispersion for transport dominated by advection however in rwpt there is no such numerical dispersion a comparison of btcs obtained by the rwpt kde fdm tvd fdm moc and the analytic solution for varying peclet numbers illustrates the superiority of rwpt models over fdm in an advection dominated transport in addition to advection and hydrodynamic dispersion the aem rwpt kde model can simulate radioactive decay and linear adsorption an analytical expression is modified to represent the exponential radioactive decay for discrete time steps and this feature is incorporated into the rwpt model linear adsorption is also incorporated in the aem rwpt kde model by moving all the particles with a retarded velocity u r d instead of u in this study it is shown that the aem rwpt kde model is more accurate than mixed eulerian lagrangian models fdm tvd fdm moc the applications of aem rwpt kde model

introduction the transport processes of conservative groundwater solutes are usually modeled by considering two mechanisms i e advection and hydrodynamic dispersion bear and cheng 2010 with non conservative solutes the solute may degrade radioactive decay or biodegradation or mass transfer of solutes adsorption can take place between the liquid and solid portions of groundwater systems batu 2005 kresic 2007 sudicky et al 2013 subsurface solute transport is usually predicted by simulating the groundwater flow and the advection dispersion reaction equation adre numerical simulation techniques such as the finite difference fdm and the finite element method fem are commonly applied for groundwater flow simulations bear and cheng 2010 boddula and eldho 2018 the aem is also quite popular for groundwater flow simulation as it has many advantages over fdm and fem strack 1989 haitjema 1995 the hydraulic head or velocity generated by aem is a spatially continuous function and aem computes the hydraulic head or velocity with great accuracy on the contrary fdm and fem compute the hydraulic head only at the nodes to compute the hydraulic head at any location using fdm or fem the hydraulic head is interpolated from the nodal hydraulic head values in the fdm or fem the interpolation of velocities may lead to discontinuity in the velocity at the edge of the element majumder and eldho 2016a 2016b in short a flow simulation model developed by aem is more continuous and accurate than fdm or fem the accuracy of the flow simulation model directly impacts the accuracy of the transport simulation model craig and rabideau 2006a 2006b however one of the limitations of aem is that it is mainly suitable to simulate steady state groundwater flow matott et al 2006 strack 1989 obtaining the solution of transient flow using aem can be computationally expensive and may require a lot of assumptions to simplify the problem bakker 2009 2004 fitts 2010 2002 furman and neuman 2003 haitjema and strack 1985 kuhlman and neuman 2008 zaadnoordijk 1990 however the steady state flow assumption is not a major limitation for most contaminant transport simulations contaminant transport through the subsurface is generally a very slow process hence short term transience in groundwater flow can often be neglected craig and rabideau 2006a 2006b frind and matanga 1985 kuo et al 1992 matott et al 2006 the eulerian approaches such as fdm and fem methods are the most common choice for contaminant transport simulation for advection dominated contaminant transport problems the eulerian transport models fdm or fem and hybrid eulerian lagrangian methods method of characteristics moc hybrid method of characteristics hmoc are susceptible to the numerical dispersion error caused by truncation of the spatial derivative terms of the adre majumder and eldho 2016a zheng and wang 1999 among the eulerian approaches the combined use of third order total variation diminishing tvd schemes for advection and implicit finite difference method for dispersion is the most accurate scheme harten 1983 yee 1987 zheng and wang 1999 alternatively contaminant transport processes can be simulated by lagrangian approaches such as random walk particle tracking rwpt herrera et al 2009 majumder and eldho 2016a in rwpt a finite number of particles are used to discretize the contaminant mass and in each transport time step particles move through the subsurface by advection hydrodynamic dispersion and chemical reaction kinzelbach 1986 furthermore in rwpt there is no numerical dispersion salamon et al 2006 majumder and eldho 2016a applied a vectorised aem rwpt model to simulate groundwater flow and contaminant processes through heterogeneous aquifers the aem rwpt model satisfies the global local solute mass balance condition with greater accuracy than fdm or fem based models the accuracy and efficiency of the rwpt model can be significantly enhanced by coupling it with kernel density estimator kde härdle 2009 loader 1999 rahbaralam et al 2015 silverman 1986 kde is the most popular non parametric way to estimate the probability density function pdf of random variables botev et al 2010 rahbaralam et al 2015 however the performance of kde depends on optimal bandwidth which is very difficult to compute härdle 2009 heidenreich et al 2013 carried out an extensive review on the selection of bandwidth for kde and they found that a mixture of cross validation methods and simple plug in generates stable bandwidth however the availability of various kde based software packages has made it easier to apply it to contaminant transport simulation the aem rwpt model of majumder and eldho 2016a can simulate only advection and hydrodynamic dispersion first order chemical reaction radioactive decay and linear adsorption can also be simulated using rwpt kinzelbach 1986 proposed approaches to implement radioactive decay and linear adsorption in rwpt however the proposed methodologies have never been used at the case study level in this study a simulation model is proposed to solve two dimensional groundwater flow and advection dispersion reaction equation using aem rwpt and kde two different types of contaminants are examined in examples in this study the first one is radionuclide radium 228 and the other is trichloroethene tce with radium 228 the transport occurs by three mechanisms i e advection hydrodynamic dispersion and radioactive decay with tce the transport occurs by advection hydrodynamic dispersion and linear adsorption 2 methodology the steady state groundwater flow equation can be presented as bear and cheng 2010 1 k ϕ q s where k is hydraulic conductivity lt 1 ϕ is hydraulic head l q s is the sink source t 1 the

the ith and jth directions lt 1 u is the seepage velocity vector d ij m is the effective molecular diffusion coefficient in this paper aem is used to solve eq 1 and rwpt is used to solve eq 3 a brief description of aem and rwpt is presented below 2 1 analytic element method aem in the aem hydrological features such as pumping injection wells rivers and inhomogeneities are represented by analytic element functions there are elements for points wells lines rivers linear boundaries and areas recharge leakage in aem only the boundary of the domain is discretized but not the whole domain the model in aem can be expressed in terms of the discharge potential the discharge potential φ for confined and unconfined aquifer cases can be expressed as batista et al 2012 steward 2015 steward and allen 2013 5a φ kh ϕ b 1 2 k h 2 if ϕ b h 5b φ 1 2 k ϕ b 2 if ϕ b h where h is the aquifer thickness l ϕ is the hydraulic head and b is the aquifer base elevation l detailed explanations of the aem can be found in haitjema 1995 and strack 1989 2017 2 2 random walk particle tracking rwpt rwpt is a lagrangian approach to simulate the advection dispersion reaction equation in rwpt a finite number of particles are used to represent contaminant mass the particles move through the subsurface by three mechanisms advection hydrodynamic dispersion and chemical reaction paster et al 2014 the movement of each particle can be represented by the ito taylor integration scheme as majumder and eldho 2016a robinson et al 2010 srinivasan et al 2010 2012 sun et al 2015 6a x t δt x t u x d xx x d xy y δt r 1 2 d xx δt r 2 2 d xy δt 6b y t δt y t u y d yx x d yy y δt r 3 2 d yx δt r 4 2 d yy δt where x t δt y t δt is the particle s position at the time t δt l x t y t is the particle s position at the time t l u x and u y are the components of seepage velocity in x and y direction respectively lt 1 and r i is the gaussian distribution with unit variance and zero mean the partial derivatives of the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient in eq 6 can be computed following sun et al 2015 after moving the particles using eq 6 the contaminant concentration at any point circular area can be computed as majumder and eldho 2016a 7 c x y t n c m nπ r 2 h n p where c x y t is the concentration at the centre x y of the circle ml 3 n is the total number of particles representing contaminant mass of m amount n c is the number of particles within the circular area r is the radius of the circle l h is the thickness normal to the plane of the model l and n p is the porosity of the medium 2 3 radioactive decay decay of a radioactive material with respect to time can be expressed as batu 2005 8 a t a 0 e λ d δt in the above expression a t is the concentration of a reactant a at time t t a 0 is the concentration of a reactant a at time t 0 and λ d is the decay constant for incompressible fluids the above eq 8 is also valid for contaminant mass kinzelbach 1986 in terms of contaminant mass the above equation can also be expressed as kinzelbach 1986 9 m t m 0 e λ d δt where m 0 is the contaminant mass at time t 0 m t is the contaminant mass at time t for discrete time steps t 1 2 3 n with time interval δt we can write 9a m 1 m 0 e λ d δt 9b m 2 m 1 e λ d δt m 0 e λ d δt e λ d δt m 0 e λ d δt 2 9c m 3 m 2 e λ d δt m 0 e λ d δt 3 9d m i m i 1 e λ d δt m 0 e λ d δt i thus in rwpt for first order reactive transport the contaminant mass reduces with respect to transport time step following eq 9d a long list of radionuclides with their half life t 1 2 can be found in batu 2005 from the half life of the radionuclide s the decay constant λ d can be computed as batu 2005 10 λ d 0 6931 t 1 2 2 4 linear adsorption isotherm the linear adsorption isotherm can be incorporated in rwpt by replacing the pore velocity u with a retarded velocity u r d the particles will be tracked with the retarded velocity u r d for the entire transport time period the retardation coefficient r d can be computed as batu 2005 11 r d 1 ρ b n p k d in the above equation ρ b is the dry bulk density n p is the porosity and k d is the distribution coefficient sorption constant 2 5 kernel density estimation kde in statistics kde is a non parametric way of computing a probability density function pdf of random variables härdle 2009 silverman 1986 it has been widely used in various inference procedures such as reactive contaminant transport simulation data mining signal processing pattern recognition machine learning and computer vision guidoum 2015 rahbaralam et al 2015 by using kde the results of rwpt simulations can be further improved the pdf of the particle time history can be obtained by kde as pedretti and fernàndez garcia 2013 12 p x y t 1 n i 1 n 1 h b k t t i h b where p x y t is the pdf of the particle time history in the fixed location x y at varying time t h b is the bandwidth of the kernel smoothing function n is the total number of the time interval t i is the ith time

epanechnikov bi weight triangular rectangular and so forth silverman 1986 in this study we have used the gaussian kernel which can be expressed as 14 k t t i h b 1 h b 2 π exp t t i 2 2 h b 2 the concentrations at a particular point with respect to time can be computed from the pdf p x y t as 15 c x y t m p x y t t 0 t n n t nπ r 2 h n p where c x y t is the concentration in a fixed location x y at time t n is the total number of particles representing contaminant mass of m amount h is the thickness of aquifer n t is the number of particles inside the control volume at time t hence t 0 t n n t is the summation of the number of particles starting from time interval t 0 to t n inside the control volume 2 5 1 selection of optimal bandwidth the choice of optimal bandwidth h b is a critical aspect for efficient use of kde a very low value of bandwidth h b causes spurious fluctuations in the probability density function pdf estimate and a high value of bandwidth h b causes excessive smoothing of the pdf härdle 2009 loader 1999 the optimal bandwidth h b opt can be computed as fernàndez garcia and sanchez vila 2011 rahbaralam et al 2015 16 h b opt r n 1 5 17 r k 2 2 p t 2 2 μ 2 k 2 1 5 in the above equation p t is the 2nd derivative of the concentration normalized by total contaminant mass in the system μ 2 k is the second moment of k 2 2 is the l 2 norm operator commonly used bandwidth h b selection methods are rule of thumb plug in methods and cross validation guidoum 2015 härdle 2009 silverman 1986 botev et al 2010 proposed kernel density estimation via diffusion they proposed a new plug in bandwidth selection method which does not require the assumption that the data are normally distributed botev et al 2010 claimed the superiority of new plug in bandwidth selection method over all existing approaches in this study we have directly used a matlab function given by botev et al 2010 for kernel density estimation 3 model development initially the aem rwpt model is developed following majumder and eldho 2016a to improve the efficiency and accuracy it is combined with the kernel density estimator kde in addition to advection and hydrodynamic dispersion the aem rwpt kde model is able to simulate radioactive decay and linear adsorption the steps to combine aem rwpt with kde to simulate first order chemical reaction and linear adsorption are given below 3 1 steps to enhance the rwpt model by combining it with kde i from the aem rwpt model obtain the number of particles inside a control volume in different time steps t i t 1 t 2 t 3 t i t n ii suppose at time t i the total number of particles inside the control volume is n i generate a vector vt i of dimension 1 n i the vector vt i will be v t i i 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 where i 1 n iii repeat step ii for all the time intervals concatenate all the vectors the concatenated vector will look like vt 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 n n n n iv using eq 12 compute the probability density function p x y t of the particle time series data at the control volume we assumed the kernel as gaussian the bandwidth h b is selected following a new plug in bandwidth selection method proposed by botev et al 2010 v from the probability density function p x y t the concentration c i at the center of a control volume can be computed easily using eq 15 3 2 steps to simulate first order chemical reaction using aem rwpt kde model in continuation of the steps mentioned above the following are the additional steps to incorporate radioactive decay i from the half life of the radionuclide compute the decay constant using eq 10 ii assume the contaminant mass m 0 as 1 unit normalized mass and obtain the expressions of m i using eq 9d where i 1 2 3 n and m i is a vector of normalized mass which shows the exponential decay of radionuclide with respect to time iii obtain the product c i c i m i here c i is the contaminant concentration due to advection hydrodynamic dispersion and radioactive decay a flowchart depicting aem rwpt kde model is shown in fig 1 4 model validation and sensitivity analysis for an impulse contaminant injection from a point source the two dimensional analytic solution due to advection hydrodynamic dispersion radioactive decay and linear adsorption can be expressed as harten 1983 kinzelbach 1986 18 c x y t c 0 a 4 πt d xx d yy exp λ d t x x 0 u x r d t 2 4 d xx t y y 0 2 4 d yy t in the above equation the flow is uniform in the x direction here c 0 is the initial contaminant concentration ml 3 a is contaminant source area l2 x 0 y 0 is the center of the contaminant source l d xx d yy are the longitudinal and transverse dispersion l2 t 1 λ d is the decay constant of the radionuclide and r d is the retardation coefficient in the following sub sections a comparative study is carried out to understand the influence of kde on rwpt solution quality further an analysis is carried out to comprehend the performance of the rwpt kde model for the advection dominated problem considering advection hydrodynamic dispersion and radioactive decay the rwpt kde model is validated against the analytical solution eq 18 r d is assumed as 1 in this case furthermore assuming λ d 0 and considering advection hydrodynamic dispersion and linear adsorption the rwpt kde model is validated against an analytical solution here a hypothetical homogeneous isotropic confined aquifer as given in majumder and eldho 2016a is considered to carry out the above mentioned analysis following are the aquifer parameters seepage velocity u x in the longitudinal direction is 0 5 m day porosity n p of the medium is 0 3 dispersivity α l α t in both longitudinal and transverse directions is 0 1 m here it is also assumed that a contaminant mass of 10 g is instantaneously injected at point a x 0 5 m y 0 8 m over an area of 0 01 m 0 01 m fig 2 4 1 performance of rwpt kde model here the performance of the rwpt kde model is assessed against the rwpt model to induce enough oscillations in the computed concentrations a very small time step δt 0 1 day and small radius of control volume r 0 1 m is assumed for the rwpt model also the number of particles n to represent contaminant mass was 0 1 million the contaminant concentration at point b fig 2 is evaluated by analytical solution rwpt and rwpt kde model in fig 3 it can be seen that the breakthrough curve btc obtained by rwpt kde model is very close to the analytical solution whereas the btc obtained by rwpt oscillates a lot here it is observed that the kde smooths and improves the solution quality of rwpt model hence the rwpt kde model is a superior concentration estimation technique compared to the rwpt model 4 2 performance of rwpt kde model for advection dominated problem many field problems are advection dominated and the dimensionless peclet number pe is used to ensure accuracy of numerical simulation craig and rabideau 2006a 2006b the peclet number pe can be expressed as huyakorn 1983 zheng and wang 1999 19 pe u δl d ij in the above expression u is the magnitude of seepage velocity vector δl is the characteristic length and d ij is the dispersion coefficient tensor eq 4 in one dimensional transport δl δx and in two dimensional transport δl max δx δy here δx and δy are the grid sizes along x and y direction the contaminant transport process of the above mentioned problem fig 2 is simulated by the highly accurate fdm tvd scheme zheng and wang 1999 for varying peclet number pe 2 5 25 100 200 different peclet numbers are obtained by varying the longitudinal α l and transverse dispersivity α t as α l α t 0 1 m α l α t 0 01 m α l α t 0 0025 m α l α t 0 00125 m other aquifer parameters are kept as same as in the previous section the btcs are generated at point b by three methods analytical solution fdm tvd scheme and rwpt kde method fig 4 the transport time step δt is assumed as 0 25 days for fdm tvd scheme the grid size is 0 25 m 0 25 m for rwpt simulation the radius of the circular grid is 0 25 m from the figure it can be seen that for peclet number 2 5 the btcs obtained at point b by the three methods are very close even for higher peclet numbers pe 25 100 200 the btcs generated by rwpt kde are close to the analytical solution on the contrary the btcs generated by the tvd schemes have noticeable deviation from the analytical solution with increase in peclet number for the tvd schemes the discrepancy is due to numerical dispersion caused by truncation error and concentration averaging due to higher grid size the rwpt kde shows no numerical dispersion with an increase in peclet number as expected for this method hence it can be concluded that the rwpt kde is completely free from numerical dispersion a similar analysis is carried out to comprehend the contaminant transport processes again by three methods analytical solution fdm method of characteristics moc and rwpt fig 5 as can be seen from fig 5 rwpt kde is more accurate than fdm moc which is also prone to numerical dispersion for an advection dominated problem 4 3 validation of rwpt kde model for simulation of advection dispersion reaction equation radioactive decay case the rwpt kde model for radioactive decay is validated by applying it to a hypothetical problem as shown in fig 2 here it is assumed that 10 g of a radionuclide is instantaneously injected at point a over an area of 0 01 m 0 01 m fig 2 the decay constant λ d of the radionuclide is 0 02 per day the transport is simulated analytically by using eq 18 and numerically by rwpt kde assuming r d 1 in eq 18 btcs are also generated for λ d 0 and λ d 0 01 the btcs generated at the observation point b are shown in fig 6 it can also be seen that the btc generated by rwpt kde closely matches the analytic solution the rwpt kde simulation is carried out by considering 0 1 million particles here the transport time step δt is assumed as 1 day and radius of the circle r over which concentrations have to be computed as 0 25 m the sensitivity analysis of those parameters can be found in majumder and eldho 2016a so we are not repeating it here 4 4 validation of rwpt kde model for simulation of advection dispersion reaction equation linear adsorption case here the retardation coefficient r d is assumed as 2 24 and λ d 0 no radioactive decay btcs are generated at point b analytically using eq 18 for the rwpt kde simulation it is assumed that particle moves at a retarded velocity u r d instead of u the velocity u r d is used to compute the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient tensor the btc generated by rwpt kde is similar to the analytical solution fig 7 5 model applications here we simulated contaminant transport processes of two hypothetical aquifers using aem rwpt kde model 5 1 case study 1 two different contaminant transport conditions are considered for case study 1 in the first case it is assumed that the contaminant is a radionuclide radium 228 in this case contaminant transport is taking place via three mechanisms advection hydrodynamic dispersion and radioactive decay in the second case the contaminant is trichloroethene tce the tce undergoes linear adsorption in addition to advection and hydrodynamic dispersion 5 1 1 reactive contaminant transport modeling assuming the contaminant as radium 228 this case study considers a hypothetical heterogeneous unconfined aquifer fig 8 the thickness of the aquifer is 60 m in the aquifer there is a rectangular inhomogeneity domain the hydraulic conductivity inside the inhomogeneity domain is 1 m day and the background hydraulic conductivity is 4 m day recharge of the aquifer is 0 001 m day it is assumed that 1 kg of radium 228 is instantaneously sprinkled over an areal source 50 m 50 m as shown in fig 8 the aquifer parameters and associated boundary condition are shown in table 1 and fig 8 aem is used to represent various aquifer features the constant head boundary is discretized into several line sink elements strack 1989 the no flow boundary is assumed as a polygon with zero hydraulic conductivity and each side of the polygon is represented by a higher order line doublet janković and barnes 1999 a polygonal areal sink having constant strength strack 1989 is used to represent recharge the half life of radium 228 is 5 8 years and the decay constant λ d is 3 2739 10 4 per day 0 1 million particles are used to represent 1 kg of radium 228 it is assumed that the transport time step δt is 1 day and radius r of the control volume over which concentration has to be computed is 10 m the btcs are generated at point p1 p2 p3 p4 fig 8 by the aem rwpt kde model and shown in fig 9 btcs are also generated using modflow mt3d and they are found to be similar to those obtained by rwpt kde btcs are also generated assuming no radioactive decay the distribution of the contaminant concentrations at different stress periods second year fourth year sixth year eight year obtained by aem rwpt kde model are shown in fig 10 this figure shows the practical application of aem rwpt kde model to simulate contaminant transport processes of a hypothetical unconfined aquifer considering advection hydrodynamic dispersion and first order chemical reaction 5 1 2 reactive contaminant transport modeling assuming the contaminant as trichloroethene tce instead of the radionuclide here it is assumed that the contaminant is tce it is assumed that 1 kg of tce is instantaneously released over an areal source 50 m 50 m as shown in fig 8 the dry bulk density ρ b of the porous media is assumed as 1 86 g cm3 the distribution coefficient k d of the tce is 0 20 cm3 g batu 2005 the retardation coefficient r d is computed using eq 11 by keeping other hydraulic parameters same as in the previous section the transport processes are simulated using rwpt kde the btcs generated at point p1 p2 p3 p4 using aem rwpt kde model are shown in fig 11 further btcs are also obtained by modflow mt3d the btcs obtained by both methods are quite similar the distribution of the contaminant concentrations at different stress periods second year fourth year sixth year eight year are shown in fig 12 the aem rwpt kde model is capable of simulating combined advection dispersion and linear adsorption of the contaminant as demonstrated in this case study 5 2 case study 2 here aem rwpt kde model is applied to simulate contaminant transport processes of a complex hypothetical unconfined aquifer as shown in fig 13 this case study is structurally similar to one of the case study reported in majumder and eldho 2016a however some of the aquifer parameters and contamination is assumed suitably all the aquifer parameters and boundary conditions are given in table 2 and fig 13 the aquifer has three zones of varying hydraulic conductivity hydraulic conductivity in zone 1 zone 2 and zone 3 are 20 m d 25 m d 30 m d respectively the transport process of the aquifer is advection dominated due to high hydraulic conductivity values the aquifer has many complex hydrogeological features such as inhomogeneity domains no flow boundary constant flux boundary seepage from a pond groundwater recharge and a stream the stream is discretized into several segments and each segment is represented by head specified line sinks the constant flux boundary is also discretized into several segments and each segment is represented by an extraction specified line sink inhomogeneity domains and a no flow boundary are represented by higher order line doublets also it is assumed that 150 kg of radium is accidently spilled instantaneous injection over a pond as shown in fig 13 representing the contaminant mass by 0 1 million particles the transport simulation is carried out for 20 years using aem rwpt kde model the btcs are generated at points p1 p2 p3 p4 by aem rwpt kde model and they are found to be closely similar with the btcs generated by a comparable modflow mt3d model fig 14 the spatial distribution of concentrations obtained by aem rwpt kde model at the end of ten and twenty years are shown in fig 15 the case study depicts the success of aem rwpt kde model in simulating reactive contaminant transport modeling with in a complex hypothetical aquifer system such kind of complexities may arise in simulating flow and transport processes of real field aquifers hence this case study demonstrates the potential applicability of proposed aem rwpt kde model in simulating a real field aquifer problem 6 discussion the present study proposes the aem rwpt kde simulation model to solve groundwater flow and advection dispersion reaction equations for the same number of particles the aem rwpt kde model computes contaminant concentrations more precisely than the aem rwpt model which is one of the major contributions of the proposed methodology additionally the aem rwpt kde model is able to simulate radioactive decay and linear adsorption in addition to advection and hydrodynamic dispersion also it is shown that for advection dominated transport the rwpt kde model does not introduce numerical dispersion unlike fdm or fem for a hypothetical confined aquifer the btc generated by a rwpt kde model considering advection hydrodynamic dispersion and radioactive decay is verified against an analytical solution the aem rwpt kde model is successfully applied to simulate the groundwater flow and reactive contaminant transport radioactive decay and linear adsorption of two hypothetical heterogeneous aquifer systems there are a few limitations of the proposed methodology the use of aem to simulate highly heterogeneous media is still limited aem is mostly suitable to simulate piecewise hydraulic conductivity variations fitts 2010 however some recent developments in aem are encouraging such as use of laplace transform aem to simulate transient groundwater flow processes and use of aem to simulate harmonically heterogeneous media craig 2009 kuhlman and neuman 2008 also using finite difference time steps allows anaqsim to simulate general groundwater transient flows fitts 2010 7 conclusions the aem rwpt kde model is proposed to solve groundwater flow and advection dispersion reaction equations aem computes continuous head and velocity information hence it is amenable for rwpt simulation additionally kde enhances the accuracy of the concentrations predicted by rwpt model eulerian transport models such as fdm and fem are prone to numerical dispersion for transport dominated by advection however in rwpt there is no such numerical dispersion a comparison of btcs obtained by the rwpt kde fdm tvd fdm moc and the analytic solution for varying peclet numbers illustrates the superiority of rwpt models over fdm in an advection dominated transport in addition to advection and hydrodynamic dispersion the aem rwpt kde model can simulate radioactive decay and linear adsorption an analytical expression is modified to represent the exponential radioactive decay for discrete time steps and this feature is incorporated into the rwpt model linear adsorption is also incorporated in the aem rwpt kde model by moving all the particles with a retarded velocity u r d instead of u in this study it is shown that the aem rwpt kde model is more accurate than mixed eulerian lagrangian models fdm tvd fdm moc the applications of aem rwpt kde model

1598,contaminants removal stoked inside low permeability zones of aquifers is one of the most important challenge of groundwater remediation process today low permeability layers can be considered persistent secondary sources of contamination because they release pollutants by molecular diffusion after primary source of contamination is reduced causing long plum tails back diffusion in this study the groundwater circulation well gcw system was investigated as an alternative remediation technology to the low efficient traditional pumping technologies to restore contaminated low permeability layers of aquifers the gcw system creates vertical groundwater circulation cells by drawing groundwater through a screen of a multi screen well and discharging it through another screen the suitability of this technology to remediate contaminated low permeability zones was investigated by laboratory test and numerical simulations the collected data were used to calibrate a model created to simulate the back diffusion process and to evaluate the effect of different pumping technologies on the depletion time of that process results show that the efficiency of the gcw is dependent on the position and on the geometry of the low permeability zones however the gcw system appears more suitable to restore contaminated low permeability layers of aquifers than the traditional pumping technology keywords aquifer restoration contaminated low permeability layers back diffusion groundwater pumping wells numerical model 1 introduction it is easy to encounter papers and or debates concerning despite decades of efforts to restore contaminated sites persistent groundwater contaminant plumes often with concentration values above regulated limits are commonly observed after remediation activity or site closure stroo et al 2003 chapman and parker 2005 parker et al 2008 matthieu et al 2014 it is also well known that often such phenomenon can be the result of the presence of dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls as well as zones where the back diffusion bd process takes place dnapl can be considered as a long term source of groundwater contamination due to dissolved contaminants emanating from high saturation dnapl pools or residual saturation ganglia falta et al 2005 park and parker 2005 chen and jawitz 2008 carey et al 2014 the bd process occurs frequently at aged sites where while concentrations in the more transmissive zones decline contaminants sequestered in low permeability zones are released back into the water by fickian diffusion the first study regarding the impact of the bd during the remediation process was conducted by mackay and cherry 1989 they reported the limitations of the pump and treat technology due to the back

maghrebi et al 2015 one of the major troubles is that numerical models on these topics hardly have been calibrated on experimental data this should represent a great step because at real field sites variability of permeability at the small scale can range over several orders of magnitude the main difficulty caused by the back diffusion phenomenon is encountered during remediation process in fact remediation efforts are hampered by long depletion time of bd and by difficulties to locate contaminated low permeability zones therefore remediation processes based on bulk approach can be considered the best solution to restore heterogeneous media laboratory and field tests mackay and cherry 1989 lee et al 2000 guo and brusseau 2017 tatti et al 2018 demonstrate the low efficiency of traditional pumping technology to remediate aquifers interested by persistent plume due to the back diffusion process this study investigates the suitability of groundwater recirculation wells to restore polluted low permeability layers of aquifers as an alternative remediation technology to the traditional pumping system gcw is a type of well characterized by two or more screened sections that increases water circulation extracting polluted water from a screened section and injecting fresh water from another section this technology stems from the idea of contaminant removal by means a well water extraction that enhance the velocity of trapped contaminant depletion if compared to natural flow to achieve the objective of the study the effects of enhanced water circulation induced by the gcw system to the bd process are investigated by laboratory test and numerical model furthermore numerical simulations are performed to evaluate the more suitable configurations of gcw to enhance dissolution of trapped contaminant depending on geometry and position of medium heterogeneities 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory investigation experimental set up the experimental apparatus used to perform the test consisted of a box model a groundwater circulation well gcw with three screens two peristaltic pumps connected to the well four uv lamps positioned in front of the tank and a 3ccd camera fig 1 an aquifer was reconstructed inside the box model with length l 1 m height h 0 7 m and depth 0 12 m the box is divided in three parts a central part used to reconstruct the aquifer and two small chambers on the side the chambers were collected to the central part by punched plates and they were utilized to control the water head the model of the reconstructed aquifer consists of a high permeability layer and two low permeability lenses with different grain size and hydraulic conductivities the high permeability layer was reproduced using quartz sand and the two lenses utilizing quartz flour the grain size of the materials was estimated by the laboratory measurements tatti et al 2018 the sand and the lenses hydraulic conductivities were evaluated using the formula proposed by hazen and by kozeny and carman respectively the porosity of the two lenses was estimated using the approach proposed by vukovic and soro 1992 the properties of the materials are reported in table 1 and as it shows lens 1 is characterized by bigger grain size by higher permeability and by lower porosity than lens 2 in the middle section of the sand layer between the two low permeability lenses a gcw model was located fig 2 the gcw is 1 m high and it has a diameter of 0 11 m it had three screens and the boreholes between the screens are impermeable gravel was positioned near the screens to prevent sand from escaping into the well the first screen was located at the top of the aquifer the second at the middle part of the sand layer and the third at the aquifer bottom sodium fluorescein was used as tracer due to its property to emit light ranging from green to orange as a function of its concentration when it is excited by uv light this property allows for the use of the image analysis technique to estimate the tracer concentration during the test in the reported experiment fluorescein was excited using 4 uv lamps positioned in from of the box model a 3ccd camera connected to a computer was located behind the uv lamps in order to acquire images of the aquifer 2 2 test procedure the low permeability zones of the aquifer were saturated with a solution containing 2 g l of dissolved fluorescein lens 1 and lens 2 were filled with an amount of about 0 1 g and 0 2 g of tracer respectively the second lens contained more fluorescein than the first one due to its higher porosity and dimensions the saturated lenses were inserted into the sand layer and the aquifer was then saturated with clean water two peristaltic pumps working at a fixed flow rate around 120 l h were connected to the upper screen of the gcw and to the lower screen respectively water was introduced into the aquifer from the upper screen and extracted from the lower in this way the gcw system creates a flow field characterized by circular pathlines the circulation into the aquifer lasted for 8 days and during this phase the back diffusion process was clearly visible fig 3 the tracer released by the lenses generates tails during the test images of the aquifer were collected continuously with a prefixed time interval from an automatic acquisition system and stored on a computer to improve the clarity of the pictures a uv filter hoya pro1 digital filter uv was applied to the camera lens 2 3 image analysis procedure to evaluate the fluorescein concentration inside the aquifer a calibration procedure was used tatti et al 2016 briefly an aquifer was saturated with solutions at different known concentrations of fluorescein and for each solution images of a saturated box model were collected for every picture the three colors channels were split and using a suitable software the spatial average intensity of the green color measured over the aquifer was measured color intensity values obtained by image elaboration coupled with the respective concentrations were interpolated to determine the analytical relations between the fluorescein concentrations and the green light intensities an exponential function fits the relation between the green color intensity and the concentrations tatti et al 2016 to investigate the effect of water circulation on the back diffusion process the mass of fluorescein released during the test was estimated to achieve the goal the diffusive flux of tracer released by the two lenses was calculated adopting the image analysis procedures described in tatti et al 2018 for each lens a specific section crossing the plume tail was considered fig 4 and using the relations obtained during the calibration phase a fluorescein concentration c was assigned to the analyzed sections the obtained concentration values were used in eq 1 to calculate the diffusive flow per unit of time j released by each lens 1 j c l u where l cm is the analyzed section length and u cm s is the bulk average darcy velocity the darcy velocity u was estimate by image analysis technique considering the position of the fluorescein tail in images captured with a fixed time interval this method was validated using the theoretical approach proposed by ross and gary 1992 the diffusive flux j was calculated for each lens and for each image captured during the test the fluorescein mass released from low permeability lenses was obtained multiplying every value of j by the time interval between the capture of the images in this way the values of fluorescein mass in each lens vs time were obtained fig 5 as the results show the depletion time of the mass contained in the lenses due to the back diffusion phenomenon is longer for the second lens due to its major dimensions and to its lower permeability this result agrees with data reported in tatti et al 2018 that show an increase of the remediation time correlated to the decrease of grain size 2 4 numerical model a numerical model was implemented to reproduce the back diffusion process and to evaluate the effects of the different pumping technologies on the contaminant redistribution process from low to high permeability zones of an aquifer considering a heterogeneous and anisotropic aquifer the fluid flow was simulated numerically using the groundwater flow equation 2 s s h t x i k ij h x j q s where h is the hydraulic head l kij is the hydraulic conductivity tensor lt 1 ss is the specific storage of the porous media l 1 and qs is the volumetric flux of water extracted injected per unit of aquifer volume t 1 for the groundwater velocity was used the classic darcy equation 3 u i k ij n h x j where hydraulic head was obtained from the solution of eq 2 the numerical simulation of non reactive contaminants transported in an aquifer was carried out using the transport and diffusion equation 4 c t u i c x i c x i d ij c x j where c ml 3 is the solute concentration ui are the components of velocity vector and dij l2 t 1 is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor the equations used in the model are numerically solved in two dimensions using the finite difference method the domain was divided into a regular orthogonal grid with spacing 10 2 m for the bottom and for the side boundaries of the domain the neumann condition was used the model was validated reproducing the laboratory test described in paragraph 2 and comparing the experimental results with the numerical ones the calibration phase was carried out by varying the values of the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient and the hydraulic conductivity of the media table 2 reports the input data used in the model from the results it was evident that inside the two lenses even with a different grain size the value of the dispersion coefficient is practically equivalent to the molecular diffusion coefficient of the fluorescein bringing to the conclusion that the driving parameter inside the lenses for the solute motion is the molecular diffusion and the driving force is the concentration gradient at the interface to validate the model comparison of the fluorescein mass contained inside the lenses determined numerically and the one estimated by image analysis is presented in fig 5 the agreement between the values can be considered satisfactory to demonstrate the model suitability to reproduce the investigated process 3 results the numerical model was used to reproduce contaminants redistribution from low to high permeability zones of aquifers simulating a possible field scenario the bd phenomenon was investigated using a model of aquifer characterized by random heterogeneous permeability ranged from 10 4 m s to 10 7 m s and considering two different flow conditions natural groundwater flow fig 6a and enhanced groundwater flow due to water extraction by a traditional pumping well fig 6b comparing the bd depletion time obtained for the two simulated scenarios it is possible to note a decrease of depletion time using pumping technology fig 6c this result confirms the idea that water extraction from wells enhances the velocity of trapped contaminant depletion if compared to natural flow however as reported in tatti et al 2018 efficiency of traditional pumping technology to restore low permeability zones of aquifers is undermined by the molecular diffusion that appears to be the dominant process of the bd phenomenon in order to improve management of persistent plumes the numerical model was used to investigate the effects of the gcw technology with two and three screen sections comparing them with those of a classic pump and treat system on the contaminant redistribution process from low permeability layers fig 7 to achieve this goal the laboratory test was numerically simulated varying injection extraction water flow rate and considering different positions and shapes of the polluted low permeability layers inside the aquifer the first numerical simulation of the groundwater circulation well was carried out pumping contaminated water from the lower screen and injecting clean water from the upper screen fig 8a and c the traditional well characterized by only one screen was simulated extracting water from a lower screen fig 8b and d as generally used at the field scale to investigate the effect of the injection extraction water flow rate q on the back diffusion process three flow rates were simulated q 60 l h q 120 l h and q 150 l h fig 8e and f show how enhancing the flow rate of water circulation the tracer depletion time decreased for both the two lenses this trend appears valid for both remediation technologies investigated however the decrease of the depletion time is more evident in case of gcw fig 8e and f this result depends on the different effects generates by the two considered types of well both the remediation technologies develop a flow field that removes the contaminant at the interface between the high and the low permeability zones increasing the diffusive flux of contaminant released by the lenses the gcw develops also a hydraulic gradient orthogonal to the main axis of the low permeability layers that generates a small flow into the lenses supporting the contaminant diffusive flow the efficiency of the groundwater circulation well was evaluated varying also the position of the low permeability lenses in particular the lenses were positioned near the bottom and close to the top of the aquifer fig 9a and b reproducing therefore situations in which the position of the low permeability layer is not clearly known for both cases three numerical simulations were carried out using different water circulation flow rates 60 l h 120 l h and 150 l h the results obtained for each position were compared to those obtained for the central position the real position of the lenses in the reconstructed aquifer at laboratory scale as fig 9c f shows for both positions of the lenses the depletion time increases compared to those obtained with the central position this result is correlated to the flow field developed by the gcw the lenses located at the top and at the bottom of the aquifer are close to the upper and the lower gcw screen respectively and thus the main component of the water flow is parallel to the main axis of the low permeability layers results obtained using a gcw are then compared to those obtained simulating the remediation of the lens positioned in the same way top and bottom of the aquifer using this time a traditional well fig 10a and b three simulations were performed pumping water at q 60 l h q 120 l h and q 150 l h comparing the trends of fluorescein mass released from the lenses using a gcw and a traditional well the mass depletion appears faster using the gcw scheme fig 10c f this result is valid for both the lenses and for both the considered positions considering the results of all numerical simulations performed the groundwater circulation well technology appears more suitable to be used in the context of the presence of contaminated low permeability lenses rather than the traditional well but as verified its efficiency depends on the position on the shape and on the orientation of the lenses in this study we have also investigated the efficiency of a gcw characterized by three screens in particular we numerically simulated the laboratory test extracting contaminated water from the middle screen of the gcw and injecting clean water through the lower and the upper screens in this way the gcw develops two circulation patterns inside the aquifer fig 11a as described for the previous tests three simulations were carried out using different values of injected flow rate q 60 l h q 120 l h and q 150 l h the numerical results were compared in fig 11c and d and they demonstrate a decrease in mass depletion time enhancing the circulation flow rate this result agrees with the results obtained for the traditional well and for the gcw characterized by two screens however comparing the trend of fluorescein released from the lenses using the two different models of gcw the restoration of the low permeability lenses appears faster using a gcw characterized by two screens this result is correlated with the flow field developed by the groundwater circulation well the two circulation patterns developed using a gcw with three screens are characterized by a radius of influence smaller than that of the circulation pattern generated by a gcw with two screens the low permeability lenses are close to the middle screen of the well and thus the principal component of the velocity field is parallel to the main axis of the lenses to verify the efficiency of a gcw with three screens the lenses were located at the top and at the bottom of the aquifer and their restoration was simulated fig 12a and b for both positions water was circulated using q 60 l h q 120 l h and q 150 l h for each lens and for each position the obtained results were compared with the corresponding results calculated using a gcw with two screens as the fig 12c f show the remediation times of the two lenses result higher using a gcw with three screens this result appears valid for both lenses and for both positions the performed study demonstrates that the efficiency of the gcw characterized by three screens is generally lower than the efficiency of a gcw with two screen sections because it is closely dependent on the position of the contaminated low permeability lenses to investigate the effect of lens shape to the efficiency of gcw remediation of two low permeability lenses containing an equal amount of tracer and characterized by the same hydraulic conductivity but different shape was simulated numerically two lenses with k 2 10 6 m s and 1 1 g of dissolved pollutant inside were considered the use of a gcw system with two screens was numerically reproduced injecting clean water from the upper screen and extracting contaminated water from the lower fig 13a and b the obtained results were compared to those obtained simulating the use of a classic well with only one screen positioned near the bottom of the aquifer fig 13c and d for the both pumping technologies considered numerical simulations were performed using q 60 l h q 120 l h and q 150 l h comparison between the trend of fluorescein mass contained into the two lenses shows the decrease of the tracer depletion time enhancing the injection extraction water flow rate for the both low permeability zones and for the both technologies investigated numerical simulations demonstrate also the higher suitability of the gcw system to restore the considered low permeability zones than the classic pump and treat technology fig 13e and f this result appears more evident for the large lens because the groundwater circulation well develops a hydraulic gradient inside it orthogonal to the main axis of the lens fig 13a thus the vertical component of the velocity is increased supporting the release of contaminant due to the diffusive flux the classic well instead develops a hydraulic gradient inside the large lens parallel to its main axis fig 13c and thus the effect of the induced flow is negligible 4 conclusions the proposed research aims to test the effectiveness of the gcw system to restore polluted low permeability lenses of aquifers a possible approach to remediate the lowest permeability zones is based on the mobilization of the water in contact with these areas even if their position is not well defined therefore the remediation is based on an approach that can be considered bulk and then its efficiency is strongly affected by the porous medium heterogeneities by the uncertainties on the sources position and by their dimension and orientation with respect to the groundwater flow direction the remediation approaches based on the use of traditional wells to enhance the fluid motion can bring to poor results mackay and cherry 1989 parker et al 2008 mcdade et al 2013 stemming from these considerations the reported research investigated an alternative solution that uses a gcw as base for the remediation approach before discussing the results it is important to report two considerations regarding the application of the obtained results by the laboratory test and by the numerical simulations to the field scale 1 inside the reconstructed aquifer the radial circulation generated by the well is compressed in the third dimension however the results obtained using the described experimental set up can be considered representative of what would happen in the field scale because the hypothesis is that a radial circulation can be interpreted with slices this is valid until the porous medium does not present strong heterogeneities in the plane directions a sort of horizontal isotropy then the tank can reproduce rather well the situation if there are strong gradients of conductibility the validness of the adopted scheme could fail in this last case the use of wells in general is not a valid remediation approach 2 the used numerical model solves the groundwater flow and the transport equation in 2d while in the field scale the flow field generated from a well has a radial configuration in 3d the obtained results from the numerical simulations can be considered suitable to evaluate the effects of the investigated technologies to the back diffusion process because the missing components of velocity in the experiment are the tangential ones which furnish a low contribution to the enhancing of the fickian diffusion at the interface of the low permeability lenses the presented numerical simulations have demonstrated that this solution is surely more effective than the single fenestrated well however as it can see from the results reported the number of screens and their position with respect to the contaminated area are important it is evident that in case the principal component of the velocity field is tangential to the main axis of a contaminated area groundwater flow enhances concentration gradient at the interface between different permeability zones increasing redistribution of trapped contaminant by fickian diffusion redistribution time can be further reduced if low permeability zones of aquifer are subject to normal flow in the same way of the tangential component it removes contaminant at the interface increasing the flux of pollutant released by fickian diffusion and at the same time it presents a hydraulic gradient between the two sides of the lens the combination of both the effects brings to a faster back diffusion process that results in a faster depletion of the source therefore the gcw system can be considered a suitable technology to be used in heterogeneous aquifers characterized by the presence of low permeability lenses the suitability is due to its capacity to generate a circular flow field with components orthogonal to the main axis of the lenses this property which represent the effectiveness of multi screen well falls in case of extended low permeability lenses layered soil that separate hydraulically two high permeability zones in this situation the cgw should be used crossing the layer and drawing water from the high permeability area above the layer and injecting water below the layer or vice versa the resulted flow field is not characterized from the same enhanced hydraulic gradient able to increase the flux of contaminant release from the low permeability layer for the difficulties to generate a circular velocity field the reported numerical simulations showed increasing the number of screens the portion of aquifer interested by the enhanced vertical hydraulic gradient decreases this is due to the smaller size of water circulating cells effects of gcw characterized by more than two screens on bd process must be evaluated carefully by further investigations in fact due to difficulties to locate contaminated low permeability layers at field scale the choice of enhance water circulation creating small multiple cells can cause the decrease of gcw efficiency to restore polluted low permeability layers the tests demonstrate that a numerical support can help to find the better configuration for the gcw screened intervals and their relative position with respect to the sources numerical simulations can give further informations on the distribution efficiency of possible improvements of biological reactions or chemical physical in situ treatment i e nano particles the correct distribution of substances necessary to aid the in situ remediation approach need to be planned to assure the highest contact between the substances and the pollutants furthermore the use of numerical models can be a valid help when combined technologies are used for the remediation processes the main point can be deduced from the reported laboratory test and numerical simulations is the importance to generate an orthogonal flow to the contaminated low permeability lenses it enhances the hydraulic gradient between the two sides of lenses which is a fundamental help for a faster diffusion of the contaminant at the interfaces therefore it is important to have a detailed description of the layered situation of the soil finalized to design the correct wells system for the better flow circulation that can enhance the transport of contaminant from the inner parts to the interfaces of low permeability areas funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors 
1598,contaminants removal stoked inside low permeability zones of aquifers is one of the most important challenge of groundwater remediation process today low permeability layers can be considered persistent secondary sources of contamination because they release pollutants by molecular diffusion after primary source of contamination is reduced causing long plum tails back diffusion in this study the groundwater circulation well gcw system was investigated as an alternative remediation technology to the low efficient traditional pumping technologies to restore contaminated low permeability layers of aquifers the gcw system creates vertical groundwater circulation cells by drawing groundwater through a screen of a multi screen well and discharging it through another screen the suitability of this technology to remediate contaminated low permeability zones was investigated by laboratory test and numerical simulations the collected data were used to calibrate a model created to simulate the back diffusion process and to evaluate the effect of different pumping technologies on the depletion time of that process results show that the efficiency of the gcw is dependent on the position and on the geometry of the low permeability zones however the gcw system appears more suitable to restore contaminated low permeability layers of aquifers than the traditional pumping technology keywords aquifer restoration contaminated low permeability layers back diffusion groundwater pumping wells numerical model 1 introduction it is easy to encounter papers and or debates concerning despite decades of efforts to restore contaminated sites persistent groundwater contaminant plumes often with concentration values above regulated limits are commonly observed after remediation activity or site closure stroo et al 2003 chapman and parker 2005 parker et al 2008 matthieu et al 2014 it is also well known that often such phenomenon can be the result of the presence of dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls as well as zones where the back diffusion bd process takes place dnapl can be considered as a long term source of groundwater contamination due to dissolved contaminants emanating from high saturation dnapl pools or residual saturation ganglia falta et al 2005 park and parker 2005 chen and jawitz 2008 carey et al 2014 the bd process occurs frequently at aged sites where while concentrations in the more transmissive zones decline contaminants sequestered in low permeability zones are released back into the water by fickian diffusion the

described in tatti et al 2018 for each lens a specific section crossing the plume tail was considered fig 4 and using the relations obtained during the calibration phase a fluorescein concentration c was assigned to the analyzed sections the obtained concentration values were used in eq 1 to calculate the diffusive flow per unit of time j released by each lens 1 j c l u where l cm is the analyzed section length and u cm s is the bulk average darcy velocity the darcy velocity u was estimate by image analysis technique considering the position of the fluorescein tail in images captured with a fixed time interval this method was validated using the theoretical approach proposed by ross and gary 1992 the diffusive flux j was calculated for each lens and for each image captured during the test the fluorescein mass released from low permeability lenses was obtained multiplying every value of j by the time interval between the capture of the images in this way the values of fluorescein mass in each lens vs time were obtained fig 5 as the results show the depletion time of the mass contained in the lenses due to the back diffusion phenomenon is longer for the second lens due to its major dimensions and to its lower permeability this result agrees with data reported in tatti et al 2018 that show an increase of the remediation time correlated to the decrease of grain size 2 4 numerical model a numerical model was implemented to reproduce the back diffusion process and to evaluate the effects of the different pumping technologies on the contaminant redistribution process from low to high permeability zones of an aquifer considering a heterogeneous and anisotropic aquifer the fluid flow was simulated numerically using the groundwater flow equation 2 s s h t x i k ij h x j q s where h is the hydraulic head l kij is the hydraulic conductivity tensor lt 1 ss is the specific storage of the porous media l 1 and qs is the volumetric flux of water extracted injected per unit of aquifer volume t 1 for the groundwater velocity was used the classic darcy equation 3 u i k ij n h x j where hydraulic head was obtained from the solution of eq 2 the numerical simulation of non reactive contaminants transported in an aquifer was carried out using the transport and diffusion equation 4 c t u i c x i c x i d ij c x j where c ml 3 is the solute concentration ui are the components of velocity vector and dij l2 t 1 is the hydrodynamic dispersion tensor the equations used in the model are numerically solved in two dimensions using the finite difference method the domain was divided into a regular orthogonal grid with spacing 10 2 m for the bottom and for the side boundaries of the domain the neumann condition was used the model was validated reproducing the laboratory test described in paragraph 2 and comparing the experimental results with the numerical ones the calibration phase was carried out by varying the values of the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient and the hydraulic conductivity of the media table 2 reports the input data used in the model from the results it was evident that inside the two lenses even with a different grain size the value of the dispersion coefficient is practically equivalent to the molecular diffusion coefficient of the fluorescein bringing to the conclusion that the driving parameter inside the lenses for the solute motion is the molecular diffusion and the driving force is the concentration gradient at the interface to validate the model comparison of the fluorescein mass contained inside the lenses determined numerically and the one estimated by image analysis is presented in fig 5 the agreement between the values can be considered satisfactory to demonstrate the model suitability to reproduce the investigated process 3 results the numerical model was used to reproduce contaminants redistribution from low to high permeability zones of aquifers simulating a possible field scenario the bd phenomenon was investigated using a model of aquifer characterized by random heterogeneous permeability ranged from 10 4 m s to 10 7 m s and considering two different flow conditions natural groundwater flow fig 6a and enhanced groundwater flow due to water extraction by a traditional pumping well fig 6b comparing the bd depletion time obtained for the two simulated scenarios it is possible to note a decrease of depletion time using pumping technology fig 6c this result confirms the idea that water extraction from wells enhances the velocity of trapped contaminant depletion if compared to natural flow however as reported in tatti et al 2018 efficiency of traditional pumping technology to restore low permeability zones of aquifers is undermined by the molecular diffusion that appears to be the dominant process of the bd phenomenon in order to improve management of persistent plumes the numerical model was used to investigate the effects of the gcw technology with two and three screen sections comparing them with those of a classic pump and treat system on the contaminant redistribution process from low permeability layers fig 7 to achieve this goal the laboratory test was numerically simulated varying injection extraction water flow rate and considering different positions and shapes of the polluted low permeability layers inside the aquifer the first numerical simulation of the groundwater circulation well was carried out pumping contaminated water from the lower screen and injecting clean water from the upper screen fig 8a and c the traditional well characterized by only one screen was simulated extracting water from a lower screen fig 8b and d as generally used at the field scale to investigate the effect of the injection extraction water flow rate q on the back diffusion process three flow rates were simulated q 60 l h q 120 l h and q 150 l h fig 8e and f show how enhancing the flow rate of water circulation the tracer depletion time decreased for both the two lenses this trend appears valid for both remediation technologies investigated however the decrease of the depletion time is more evident in case of gcw fig 8e and f this result depends on the different effects generates by the two considered types of well both the remediation technologies develop a flow field that removes the contaminant at the interface between the high and the low permeability zones increasing the diffusive flux of contaminant released by the lenses the gcw develops also a hydraulic gradient orthogonal to the main axis of the low permeability layers that generates a small flow into the lenses supporting the contaminant diffusive flow the efficiency of the groundwater circulation well was evaluated varying also the position of the low permeability lenses in particular the lenses were positioned near the bottom and close to the top of the aquifer fig 9a and b reproducing therefore situations in which the position of the low permeability layer is not clearly known for both cases three numerical simulations were carried out using different water circulation flow rates 60 l h 120 l h and 150 l h the results obtained for each position were compared to those obtained for the central position the real position of the lenses in the reconstructed aquifer at laboratory scale as fig 9c f shows for both positions of the lenses the depletion time increases compared to those obtained with the central position this result is correlated to the flow field developed by the gcw the lenses located at the top and at the bottom of the aquifer are close to the upper and the lower gcw screen respectively and thus the main component of the water flow is parallel to the main axis of the low permeability layers results obtained using a gcw are then compared to those obtained simulating the remediation of the lens positioned in the same way top and bottom of the aquifer using this time a traditional well fig 10a and b three simulations were performed pumping water at q 60 l h q 120 l h and q 150 l h comparing the trends of fluorescein mass released from the lenses using a gcw and a traditional well the mass depletion appears faster using the gcw scheme fig 10c f this result is valid for both the lenses and for both the considered positions considering the results of all numerical simulations performed the groundwater circulation well technology appears more suitable to be used in the context of the presence of contaminated low permeability lenses rather than the traditional well but as verified its efficiency depends on the position on the shape and on the orientation of the lenses in this study we have also investigated the efficiency of a gcw characterized by three screens in particular we numerically simulated the laboratory test extracting contaminated water from the middle screen of the gcw and injecting clean water through the lower and the upper screens in this way the gcw develops two circulation patterns inside the aquifer fig 11a as described for the previous tests three simulations were carried out using different values of injected flow rate q 60 l h q 120 l h and q 150 l h the numerical results were compared in fig 11c and d and they demonstrate a decrease in mass depletion time enhancing the circulation flow rate this result agrees with the results obtained for the traditional well and for the gcw characterized by two screens however comparing the trend of fluorescein released from the lenses using the two different models of gcw the restoration of the low permeability lenses appears faster using a gcw characterized by two screens this result is correlated with the flow field developed by the groundwater circulation well the two circulation patterns developed using a gcw with three screens are characterized by a radius of influence smaller than that of the circulation pattern generated by a gcw with two screens the low permeability lenses are close to the middle screen of the well and thus the principal component of the velocity field is parallel to the main axis of the lenses to verify the efficiency of a gcw with three screens the lenses were located at the top and at the bottom of the aquifer and their restoration was simulated fig 12a and b for both positions water was circulated using q 60 l h q 120 l h and q 150 l h for each lens and for each position the obtained results were compared with the corresponding results calculated using a gcw with two screens as the fig 12c f show the remediation times of the two lenses result higher using a gcw with three screens this result appears valid for both lenses and for both positions the performed study demonstrates that the efficiency of the gcw characterized by three screens is generally lower than the efficiency of a gcw with two screen sections because it is closely dependent on the position of the contaminated low permeability lenses to investigate the effect of lens shape to the efficiency of gcw remediation of two low permeability lenses containing an equal amount of tracer and characterized by the same hydraulic conductivity but different shape was simulated numerically two lenses with k 2 10 6 m s and 1 1 g of dissolved pollutant inside were considered the use of a gcw system with two screens was numerically reproduced injecting clean water from the upper screen and extracting contaminated water from the lower fig 13a and b the obtained results were compared to those obtained simulating the use of a classic well with only one screen positioned near the bottom of the aquifer fig 13c and d for the both pumping technologies considered numerical simulations were performed using q 60 l h q 120 l h and q 150 l h comparison between the trend of fluorescein mass contained into the two lenses shows the decrease of the tracer depletion time enhancing the injection extraction water flow rate for the both low permeability zones and for the both technologies investigated numerical simulations demonstrate also the higher suitability of the gcw system to restore the considered low permeability zones than the classic pump and treat technology fig 13e and f this result appears more evident for the large lens because the groundwater circulation well develops a hydraulic gradient inside it orthogonal to the main axis of the lens fig 13a thus the vertical component of the velocity is increased supporting the release of contaminant due to the diffusive flux the classic well instead develops a hydraulic gradient inside the large lens parallel to its main axis fig 13c and thus the effect of the induced flow is negligible 4 conclusions the proposed research aims to test the effectiveness of the gcw system to restore polluted low permeability lenses of aquifers a possible approach to remediate the lowest permeability zones is based on the mobilization of the water in contact with these areas even if their position is not well defined therefore the remediation is based on an approach that can be considered bulk and then its efficiency is strongly affected by the porous medium heterogeneities by the uncertainties on the sources position and by their dimension and orientation with respect to the groundwater flow direction the remediation approaches based on the use of traditional wells to enhance the fluid motion can bring to poor results mackay and cherry 1989 parker et al 2008 mcdade et al 2013 stemming from these considerations the reported research investigated an alternative solution that uses a gcw as base for the remediation approach before discussing the results it is important to report two considerations regarding the application of the obtained results by the laboratory test and by the numerical simulations to the field scale 1 inside the reconstructed aquifer the radial circulation generated by the well is compressed in the third dimension however the results obtained using the described experimental set up can be considered representative of what would happen in the field scale because the hypothesis is that a radial circulation can be interpreted with slices this is valid until the porous medium does not present strong heterogeneities in the plane directions a sort of horizontal isotropy then the tank can reproduce rather well the situation if there are strong gradients of conductibility the validness of the adopted scheme could fail in this last case the use of wells in general is not a valid remediation approach 2 the used numerical model solves the groundwater flow and the transport equation in 2d while in the field scale the flow field generated from a well has a radial configuration in 3d the obtained results from the numerical simulations can be considered suitable to evaluate the effects of the investigated technologies to the back diffusion process because the missing components of velocity in the experiment are the tangential ones which furnish a low contribution to the enhancing of the fickian diffusion at the interface of the low permeability lenses the presented numerical simulations have demonstrated that this solution is surely more effective than the single fenestrated well however as it can see from the results reported the number of screens and their position with respect to the contaminated area are important it is evident that in case the principal component of the velocity field is tangential to the main axis of a contaminated area groundwater flow enhances concentration gradient at the interface between different permeability zones increasing redistribution of trapped contaminant by fickian diffusion redistribution time can be further reduced if low permeability zones of aquifer are subject to normal flow in the same way of the tangential component it removes contaminant at the interface increasing the flux of pollutant released by fickian diffusion and at the same time it presents a hydraulic gradient between the two sides of the lens the combination of both the effects brings to a faster back diffusion process that results in a faster depletion of the source therefore the gcw system can be considered a suitable technology to be used in heterogeneous aquifers characterized by the presence of low permeability lenses the suitability is due to its capacity to generate a circular flow field with components orthogonal to the main axis of the lenses this property which represent the effectiveness of multi screen well falls in case of extended low permeability lenses layered soil that separate hydraulically two high permeability zones in this situation the cgw should be used crossing the layer and drawing water from the high permeability area above the layer and injecting water below the layer or vice versa the resulted flow field is not characterized from the same enhanced hydraulic gradient able to increase the flux of contaminant release from the low permeability layer for the difficulties to generate a circular velocity field the reported numerical simulations showed increasing the number of screens the portion of aquifer interested by the enhanced vertical hydraulic gradient decreases this is due to the smaller size of water circulating cells effects of gcw characterized by more than two screens on bd process must be evaluated carefully by further investigations in fact due to difficulties to locate contaminated low permeability layers at field scale the choice of enhance water circulation creating small multiple cells can cause the decrease of gcw efficiency to restore polluted low permeability layers the tests demonstrate that a numerical support can help to find the better configuration for the gcw screened intervals and their relative position with respect to the sources numerical simulations can give further informations on the distribution efficiency of possible improvements of biological reactions or chemical physical in situ treatment i e nano particles the correct distribution of substances necessary to aid the in situ remediation approach need to be planned to assure the highest contact between the substances and the pollutants furthermore the use of numerical models can be a valid help when combined technologies are used for the remediation processes the main point can be deduced from the reported laboratory test and numerical simulations is the importance to generate an orthogonal flow to the contaminated low permeability lenses it enhances the hydraulic gradient between the two sides of lenses which is a fundamental help for a faster diffusion of the contaminant at the interfaces therefore it is important to have a detailed description of the layered situation of the soil finalized to design the correct wells system for the better flow circulation that can enhance the transport of contaminant from the inner parts to the interfaces of low permeability areas funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors 
1599,the spent nuclear fuel in finland will be deposited in crystalline granitic rock in olkiluoto finland as a part of the safety assessment of the repository series of extensive in situ sorption and diffusion experiments and supplementary laboratory work has been done in the olkiluoto site through diffusion experiment in a laboratory tdelab aims to provide applicable data for the ongoing in situ experiment in olkiluoto this laboratory scale experiment resembles the in situ experiment and aims to gain information on possible effects in values of distribution coefficients effective diffusion coefficient and porosity that are caused by differences in laboratory and in situ conditions the through diffusion and sorption of tracer solution with known activities of hto 36cl 133ba and 134cs were studied in a decimeter scale sample of veined gneiss which is one of the main rock types in olkiluoto the measured breakthrough curves were modeled taking into account the porosity of the rock and diffusion and sorption of the radionuclides using time domain random walk tdrw simulations the porosities of 0 7 0 8 were determined for the rock and effective diffusion coefficients of 3 5 1 0 10 13 m2 s and 3 0 1 0 10 13 m2 s were determined for hto and 36cl respectively the porosity and effective diffusion coefficients were found to be in agreement with previous results for veined gneiss furthermore distribution coefficients of 1 0 0 3 10 4 m3 kg and 2 0 0 5 10 3 m3 kg were determined for 133ba and 134cs respectively using information about the effective diffusion coefficient determined for hto the distribution coefficients were found to be significantly smaller than the ones determined for crushed rock in previous studies and slightly smaller than the ones from previous in diffusion experiments keywords diffusion sorption porosity crystalline rock radionuclides time domain random walk 1 introduction the final disposal of spent nuclear fuel snf from present nuclear power plants in finland olkiluoto and loviisa is planned to take place in a crystalline granitic rock at olkiluoto island eurajoki finland posiva 2012 the snf will be protected by a multiple barrier system if released into the bedrock radionuclides will be transported mostly by advection along water conducting fractures the transport of the radionuclides will be retarded by molecular diffusion from the fractures into the stagnant matrix pore water and or by sorption onto mineral surfaces in the rock matrix neretnieks 1980 kekäläinen et al 2011 wels et al 1996 to resolve the magnitude of the retardation the properties of the bedrock in respect of different radionuclides have to be carefully determined for the safety assessment of the final disposal cesium is a highly soluble alkali metal occurring in the snf and its inventories in the snf are among the highest of all radionuclides 135cs is one of the critical radionuclides when considering the long term safety of the final disposal due to its long half life posiva 2013 this makes the cesium retention properties of the bedrock of great interest in the safety assessment for the final disposal of snf in deep repositories in this work 134cs was chosen as an analogue for 135cs barium is often used as a chemical analogue for radium which has a radioactive isotope 226ra with high importance in the safety assessment of the spent fuel deposition due to the ingrowth from uranium nilsson and papp 1980 the 226ra activity will reach a maximum approximately 300 000 years after the deposition of the snf grandia et al 2008 understanding the transport properties of barium and radium in the bedrock is of importance for the safety assessment of the repository barium and cesium are known to be sorbing elements in the repository conditions and sorb by ion exchange mechanism molinero and samper 2006 kyllönen et al 2014 furthermore hto and 36cl are commonly used as non sorbing radionuclides when studying the properties of bedrock hou and roos 2008 because they represent natural elements in the groundwater smellie et al 2014 they are assumed to not have chemical reaction on the mineral surfaces in granitic rock ikonen et al 2016a furthermore 36cl has great interest in the safety assessment due to its long half live and high mobility in the bedrock in situ experiments are important in order to determine the diffusion and distribution coefficient of bedrock in conditions analogous to those at the repository site however in situ experiments are costly and time consuming hence it is equally important to compare in situ results with the laboratory experiments to better assess their relevancy the in situ diffusion experiments have been performed in several countries e g finland poteri et al 2018 voutilainen et al 2014 sweden andersson et al 2004 nilsson et al 2010 widestrand et al 2010 and switzerland ikonen et al 2016a soler et al 2015 to demonstrate the behavior of radionuclides in crystalline bedrock in switzerland the retention of several radionuclides was studied in situ in grimsel granodiorite through a long term diffusion ltd experiment ikonen et al 2016a soler et al 2015 ikonen et al 2017 reported that the effective diffusion coefficients measured in laboratory and in situ experiments for grimsel granodiorite do not differ considerably from each other on the other hand soler et al 2015 report results from the same experiments that show laboratory effective diffusion coefficients that are a factor of 3 larger than the in situ coefficients only results by japan atomic energy agency are considered here since they are the only group that reports both laboratory and in situ results in addition recent experiments performed in olkiluoto finland do not show differences between the effective diffusion coefficients determined using the laboratory and in situ experiments poteri et al 2018 however the designs of the experimental setups used in the laboratory and in situ experiments differ in above mentioned studies furthermore in similar in situ experiment long term diffusion experiment ltde the retention of 22 radionuclides was studied at the äspö hard rock laboratory sweden nilsson et al 2010 widestrand et al 2010 the focus of ltde was more directed towards sorption rather than diffusion due to the relatively short experimental time of about six months the in diffusion curves have turned out to be rather difficult to explain due to the experimental design and effect of heterogeneity of the rock iraola et al 2017 park and ji 2018 a project called rock matrix retention properties repro at onkalo the underground rock characterization facility in olkiluoto finland consists of extensive series of in situ sorption and diffusion measurements that are supplemented by laboratory work aalto et al 2009 one of these in situ experiments is a through diffusion experiment tde launched in the autumn of 2015 for studying the diffusion of hto 36cl 22na 133ba and 134cs in the olkiluoto bedrock aromaa et al 2018 the aim of the repro in situ tde is to quantify diffusivity and the connected porosity of the unaltered rock matrix in the repository level stress conditions the experimental setup consists of three parallel drill holes where one is used as an injection hole decreasing concentrations measured and the breakthroughs of radionuclides to two observation drill holes are followed voutilainen et al 2014 in this study the aim has been to perform a replica of the in situ experiment in the laboratory the through diffusion experiment in the laboratory tdelab aims to study the through diffusion of hto 36cl 133ba and 134cs in veined gneiss sample resembling the olkiluoto bedrock and provide comparable data for the ongoing in situ tde often studies that aim to determine the effective diffusion coefficients and distribution coefficients are performed in the laboratory conditions recently such studies have been performed for samples e g from finland voutilainen et al 2016 muuri et al 2018 sweden widestrand et al 2007 japan tachi et al 2011 czech republic videnská et al 2015 switzerland tachi et al 2015 muuri et al 2016 and canada vilks et al 2003 typically the distribution coefficients have been measured using crushed material and batch sorption experiments however many of the recent studies show that the crushing increases the specific surface area and sorption capacity of the material which leads to an over estimation of the distribution coefficients andré et al 2009 muuri et al 2017 2018 puukko et al 2018 to this end it is important to determine distribution coefficients for intact rock when performing long term experiments with sorbing nuclides and intact rock the analysis of the results becomes more complicated since often diffusion has to be taken into account one possibility to model such experiments with taking into account the heterogeneity of the rock and other experimental details is to use time domain random walk tdrw method the method was originally developed for simulating transport in heterogeneous media mccarthy 1993 delay et al 2002 the tdrw method is a rapid particle tracking method where a particle is forced to jump to a neighboring point during a certain random transition time which makes it faster than the traditional particle tracking methods sardini et al 2003 the method has been used to study the effect of structural heterogeneities on diffusion in various cases sardini et al 2007 robinet et al 2012 voutilainen et al 2013 recently the method has been developed so that it is now possible to take into account sorption applying linear kd dentz et al 2012 ikonen et al 2016b voutilainen et al 2017 and flow in fractured media gjetvaj et al 2015 noetinger et al 2016 the method has also been found to be a powerful tool for analyzing the results of both in situ and laboratory experiments especially when initial or boundary conditions are complicated voutilainen et al 2013 soler et al 2015 ikonen et al 2017 due to the recent developments and demonstrated capability to model similar experiments the tdrw method was chosen as the modeling tool for determining the transport parameters from the measured data the aim of tdelab has been to study the diffusion and sorption of hto 36cl 133ba and 134cs and to determine retention parameters effective diffusion coefficient porosity and distribution coefficient for the intact crystalline rock sample from the repro site later these results can be compared with results from in situ tde that is being performed at repository level and with similar experimental design as tdelab by using a sample geometry resembling the in situ tde one can get comparable information about the effect of experimental conditions on the rock properties furthermore the aim is to produce site specific data for the safety assessment of the repository 2 materials and methods 2 1 rock samples the olkiluoto site is situated in south western finland on the coast of the baltic sea the repro niche where the in situ experiments are performed is located in 420 m below the surface and the bedrock in the site is pegmatitic granite and migmatitic gneiss subgroup veined gneiss pegmatitic granite is from light grey to pale colored with coarse k feldspar and commonly also cordierite and garnet pitkänen et al 1996 aaltonen et al 2016 veined gneiss was chosen for this experiment because it represents the same rock material that surrounds the in situ tde bore holes sammaljärvi et al 2017 the veined gneiss shows a weak to moderate banded foliation but locally also irregular foliation the main minerals of veined gneiss are quartz plagioclase biotite and potassium feldspar kärki and paulamäki 2006 the mineral composition of the bedrock has been shown to be an important factor for the overall sorption properties of the rock kuva et al 2018 muuri et al 2016 puukko et al 2018 2 2 experimental setup experimental setup resembled the in situ tde ongoing in olkiluoto finland voutilainen et al 2014 tracer solution with known activities was injected to an injection hole and the diffusion and sorption of radionuclides from the injection hole water were analyzed the breakthroughs of the tracer into four observation holes were monitored the rock sample shown in fig 1 was veined gneiss with strong foliation seen vertically in the fig 1 the rock block was 30 cm in height and 30 cm in diameter the injection hole marked as a in the fig 1 was drilled in the middle of the rock and four observation holes were drilled around it observation holes b1 and c1 were 1 cm away from the injection hole and b2 and c2 were 4 cm away from the injection hole two of the observation holes b1 and b2 were located so that the main direction of diffusion was perpendicular to the foliation and two other c1 and c2 so that it was along the foliation the rock sample was saturated with synthetic repro groundwater see table 1 for five months before starting the experiment saturation was done by placing the rock sample in an experimental chamber that was filled with synthetic repro groundwater so that the upmost 1 8 cm of the rock sample was still over the water table in addition all five holes in the rock sample were filled with synthetic repro groundwater the injection hole had a water volume of 63 ml whereas water volumes of the observation holes ranged from 13 to 14 5 ml all holes were sealed with rubber caps to avoid evaporation during the saturation synthetic repro groundwater was added to the holes twice a week to replace a decrease of water level after saturation time of two months the upper surface of the sample was completely moist due to capillary fringe and the rock sample was covered with epoxy resin in three stages first the bottom of the sample was sealed this was followed by sealing of the lateral surface and the upper surface the sealing was performed to ensure the complete saturation of the rock sample and to prevent the transport of radionuclides through the surface of the sample during the experiment saturation was continued after the epoxy treatment for two month by filling the experimental chamber half way with synthetic repro groundwater and the injection hole and four observation holes were also filled with synthetic repro groundwater during this phase the air was let to escape from the upper surface of the sample one month before the injection the upper surface of the sample was sealed during the last phase of saturation it was made sure that the water level did not change in the experimental holes in order to ensure stationary conditions during the saturation of the sample it was observed that the holes a c1 and c2 were interconnected by a fracture that can be seen in the upper part of fig 1 the fracture was also observed in the drill cores samples the examination of the drill core revealed that the fracture was of natural origin and that it had calcite filling the fracture groundwater in the olkiluoto site is mainly of na cl type with ph of 7 3 8 0 the groundwater is brackish at the depths from 40 m to 500 m concentrations of 9 0 10 4 to 1 1 mg l of stable natural cesium and 8 1 10 2 to 2 6 mg l of stable natural barium has been measured from olkiluoto groundwater in previous studies hellä et al 2014 synthetic repro groundwater ph 7 6 resembling the olkiluoto groundwater in repro site was prepared for this experiment see table 1 it was decided to use simple simulant to represent the olkiluoto groundwater because the chemical composition of this simulant is similar to the onk pp319 groundwater for the major elements which are chlorine sodium and calcium other elements have concentrations so small that they do not have a significant effect on the salinity of the water for this experiment the synthetic repro groundwater contains all the elements from the olkiluoto groundwater that are of importance for the diffusion and sorption studies of hto 36cl 133ba and 134cs at the beginning of the experiment the solution in the injection hole was replaced by 63 ml of tracer solution radioactive nuclides used in this experiment were hto 36cl 133ba and 134cs the ratios of the radionuclide activities was chosen to resemble the ratios used in the in situ tde table 2 shows the initial activities and concentration of hto 36cl 133ba and 134cs used in tdelab the concentrations of the radionuclides are relatively low and do not affect the concentrations given in table 1 in in situ tde 22na was also used but in tdelab it was left out due to its high radiotoxicity in laboratory conditions usually in this type of experiments 22na is used for the online monitoring of the breakthrough which was not necessary in this experiment due to continuous sampling the sampling of the injection hole was started one hour after the injection the injection hole was sampled more frequently for the first two weeks during which total of 12 samples were collected after the first two weeks the injection hole was sampled every two weeks injection hole water sample volume was 0 1 ml and the sample volume was replaced with pure synthetic repro groundwater in every sampling the 0 1 ml injection hole water sample was diluted to 5 ml with synthetic repro groundwater to achieve a calibrated sample geometry of gamma measurement the activities of the samples were decay corrected to the activity at moment of the injection according to the half lives given in table 2 water level remained constant in all experimental holes during the experiment indicating that there advection did not affect the results and the transport of tracers was purely caused by diffusion 2 3 water analyses 3h radioactive nuclide in hto and 36cl are pure beta emitters and their activities were measured with liquid scintillation counting lsc perkin elmer tri carb 2910 tr spectrum analyzer spectraworks however gamma emitting radionuclides 133ba and 134cs also have beta or electron emissions that will interfere 3h and 36cl measurements therefore in order to measure beta emitting 3h and 36cl from the groundwater solution the gamma emitting radionuclides need to be separated from them the separation was done according to an analysis method developed for the in situ tde groundwater samples aromaa et al 2018 shown in fig 2 the activities of gamma emitting radionuclides 133ba and 134cs were measured with a hpge detector canberra xtra extended range coaxial hpge detector with spectral analysis program gamma acquisition and analysis genie canberra after gamma measurement 1 ml subsample a1 of the injection hole water sample was taken for the analysis of 36cl activity the subsample was diluted to 5 ml by milliq h2o deionized using milli q millipore co and 36cl was separated from it by agno3 precipitation precipitation was performed by adding 0 5 ml of 2 mol l agno3 solution to the a1 sample the chlorine concentration of the synthetic repro groundwater 5000 mg l secures high enough chlorine content in the a1 sample so that no additional carrier is needed the chlorine concentration in the a1 sample is 0 14 m and the agno3 concentration is 0 2 m which is enough for the precipitation of all chlorine in the sample as agcl the precipitate was washed twice with 5 ml milliq h2o to ensure a clean sample for lsc the agcl precipitate was dissolved in 5 ml ammonia and measured with the hpge detector for any gamma emitting residue that might have been left in the sample bottle the 36cl sample clean from disturbing spectral components was mixed with 15 ml of liquid scintillation cocktail optiphase hisafe 3 perkin elmer and measured with lsc yields of 98 2 for agcl precipitation was determined in the previous work for similar water samples aromaa et al 2018 for the separation of hto another 1 ml subsample a2 of the injection hole water sample was diluted to 10 ml with milliq h2o hto was separated from the a2 subsample by distillation the 10 ml sample was heated with a thermophore and the vapor was condensed in a water circulation condenser distillate that contained tritium as tritiated water hto was collected into a round bottomed flask 5 ml aliquot of the distillate was measured with the hpge detector for any gamma emitting residue the clean residue was mixed with 15 ml liquid scintillation cocktail and measured with lsc for 3h activity the 10 ml distillation sample as well as the distillate were weighed for recovery determination in the previous work the recoveries of 74 6 for distillation were achieved for similar water samples aromaa et al 2018 observation holes were sampled once a week a 5 ml subsample of the water was used for the analysis of gamma emitting radionuclides 133ba and 134cs by using the hpge detector in case of no gamma emitting radionuclides in the observation hole water sample the subsample was mixed with 15 ml of liquid scintillation cocktail and the activities of 3h and 36cl were measured directly with lsc using separation of 3h and 36cl by their β energies in case of a disturbing beta electron emitters in the water sample the separation of hto and 36cl was in the same way as the injection hole water samples 2 4 time domain random walk simulations it is not possible to analyze the results of the diffusion experiments using analytical tools due to complicated geometries of the experimental systems and sampling procedure of the injection and observation holes we modeled the transport of tracer nuclides using the tdrw method as this approach can handle heterogeneous geometries and concentrations the approach is also generally convenient with large systems since computation times do not considerably depend on sample size and it is faster than more traditional simulation methods sardini et al 2003 a more detailed description of the theory is given by delay et al 2002 sardini et al 2003 and voutilainen et al 2017 so only a brief outline is given here a diffusing unit of mass is defined as a particle which is forced to jump during a transition time to one of its neighboring voxel on a mesh defining the diffusion space the transition probability pij of a particle in a voxel i to a neighboring voxel j is defined by 1 p ij b ij j b ij where 2 b ij a ij d e ij l ij with aij the total area between the voxels i and j de ij the harmonic mean of the effective diffusion coefficient de at voxels i and j and lij the distance between the centers of the voxels i and j the transition probability of a jump by a particle at a site i is taken into account such that reaching the target site takes certain time the transition time which depends on the properties of the two voxels the transition time for a jump from the voxel i to the voxel j is given by 3 t i j ε i v i j b ij log u 01 where vi is the total volume of the voxel i and u01 a random number from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 the eq 3 defines the transition time due to diffusion from the voxel i to the voxel j but it does not take into account possible sorption of the particles recently voutilainen et al 2017 developed the tdrw method further so that it is possible to account for the sorption of particles using kd concept the distribution coefficients kd are typically measured for geological samples and they define the chemical strength of sorption voutilainen et al 2017 proposed expression for sorption time ts during the transition 4 t s ε i v i j w ij log u 01 ε i v i j b ij log u 01 where 5 w ij a ij εd a ij l ij with εda ij the harmonic mean of the product of porosity and apparent diffusion coefficient da at the voxels i and j in da the effect of sorption is taken into account 6 d a d e ε 1 ε ρ k d where ρ is the density of rock a 3d 8 bit greyscale image was constructed for the simulations using imagej the 3d image was used as the simulation geometry where voxels formed a simulation mesh the grayscale image has 256 possible grayscale values for each voxel the mesh was created according to the actual dimensions of the rock sample so that one voxel represents 1 1 1 mm3 sized cube this led to a cylindrical simulation mesh with the size of 290 290 280 see fig 3a in the 3d image each component rock fracture injection hole and observation holes were colored with a unique grey scale value see fig 3b which was linked to its porosity diffusion coefficient and distribution coefficient unique grey values were also used to assist the sampling during the simulation by checking the grey value of the voxel where the particle is located after experimental sampling time has been reached see steps 3 and 4 in simulation procedure below due to the observed fracture interconnecting holes a c1 and c2 see sec 2 2 a simple planar fracture with individual properties was added into the simulation mesh see fig 3 the real fracture is of course more heterogeneous and it is simplified in our conceptual model the effective diffusion de and porosity of the intact rock and the fracture applying hto and 36cl data were first modeled using the measured concentration of injection hole as source this was followed by determination of the distribution coefficients of intact rock and fracture coatings for 133ba and 134cs by assuming the same de and porosity as for hto here the distribution coefficient of the intact rock and fracture coating were varied in order to find agreement between measured and modeled breakthrough curves the simulations were done using 5 105 particles for the non sorbing nuclides and 1 106 for the sorbing nuclides the initial position for each particle was chosen randomly in the injection hole the porosity diffusion coefficient and distribution coefficient in the injection and observation holes were set to 100 d0 in free water and no sorption applied respectively during the simulation following procedure was repeated until a preset total diffusion time was elapsed 1 determine the direction of a jump according to the transition probabilities see eq 1 and a selected random number 2 determine transition and sorption times according to eqs 3 and 4 and a second random number 3 check if experimental sampling time has passed during the jump if not return to point 1 4 check if the particle is in one of the holes if not return to point 1 5 record the location of particle and remove part of the particles according to a third random number the ratio of removed particles is set according to the sample volume and total volume of the hole in which the particle is currently located 6 check if total diffusion time is elapsed if not return to point 1 the fitting of simulated curves to experimental curves was performed by determining the sum of squared deviation for each parameter pair and by finding a minimum of the sum least squared approach the confidence limits for simulated curves were defined so that the measured curves remained within the limits and that concentration changes in the injection and observation holes could be explained using similar values for the porosity effective diffusion coefficient and distribution coefficient in case of sorbing nuclides 3 results 3 1 injection hole total of 34 samples were collected from injection hole a during 39 weeks experimental time the activities of gamma emitting 133ba and 134cs were measured with the hpge detector activities of hto and 36cl were determined by separating the radionuclides from 133ba and 134cs separated hto and 36cl were measured with lsc without spectral interferences fig 4 shows the decrease of the relative concentrations of four radionuclides in the injection hole as a function of time in fig 4 the concentrations of 133ba and 134cs decreased rapidly at the beginning of the experiment especially the concentration of 134cs decreased to almost tenth of its original value during the first month of the experiment the decrease of 133ba was more modest and the concentration decreased to sixth of the original value during the first month of the experiment the rapid decrease in the activities of 133ba and 134cs can be explained by their strong sorption onto mineral surfaces that are in direct contact with tracer solution the rapid drop is followed by a steady decrease of concentration due to in diffusion into rock and sorption on minerals surfaces within the transport routes the difference between the relative concentrations of 133ba and 134cs can be explained by a difference in their distribution coefficients the concentrations of hto and 36cl decrease modestly during the whole experiment the steady decrease is caused by in diffusion into the rock and relatively small effective diffusion coefficient a slight difference in the decrease rate between hto and 36cl can be explained by the difference in the diffusion coefficients in water what is slightly lower for 36cl d0 hto 2 22 10 9 m2 s jones et al 1965 and d0 cl 36 2 06 10 9 m2 s hawlicka 1987 after 39 weeks of the experiment only 4 9 of 134cs 4 9 if sample collection is taken into account and 17 6 of 133ba 17 9 was left in the injection hole from the non sorbing hto and 36cl radionuclides 54 56 and 63 66 respectively was left in the injection hole in the end of the experiment during the saturation it was observed that the holes a c1 and c2 were interconnected by a fracture furthermore it is known that veined gneiss samples from olkiluoto have structure with banded foliation and that transport of elements may be different across and along the foliation kärki and paulamäki 2006 due to the presence of the fracture possible effect of foliation and heterogeneity of vgn voutilainen et al 2019 it was not possible to model data from both injection and observation holes simultaneously hence the measured concentrations in the injection hole were used as the source term in the tdrw modeling see solid lines in fig 4 in the simulations the correct boundary condition was kept by adding particles to or removing them from the injection hole if needed at each measurement point see fig 4 3 2 diffusion of non sorbing nuclides observation holes were sampled once a week starting from one week from the injection total of 39 samples were collected per observation hole during 39 weeks experimental time the breakthrough curves were modeled by tdrw method using the measured concentration in injection hole a as a source fig 5 shows the measured and modeled breakthrough curves for hto and 36cl to observation holes b1 b2 c1 and c2 breakthrough of hto and 36cl was observed in all four observation holes and the breakthrough curves were successfully modeled using tdrw simulations the breakthrough curves of hto and 36cl are similar for all of the observation holes see fig 5 and the transport of these non sorbing nuclides does not depend on radionuclide in question the breakthrough of hto tends to be slightly faster than of 36cl this can be explained by small difference in the diffusion coefficients in water the values for the effective diffusion coefficient and porosity determined from the observation holes b1 and b2 represent the properties of intact rock see table 3 there is a small difference in the effective diffusion coefficients of hto and 36cl determined from observation holes b1 and b2 the difference is caused by the difference in diffusion coefficients in free water furthermore the uncertainties of the effective diffusion coefficients overlap the effective diffusion coefficients determined from the breakthrough curves of b1 are about a factor of two larger than of b2 the porosities determined from these breakthrough curves are in agreement the values determined from the breakthrough curves of hto and 36cl to the observation holes c1 and c2 represent mostly the properties of the fracture and are about two orders of magnitude higher than those of the intact rock see table 3 clearly the observed fracture increases the transport in the direction of foliation and thus the effect of foliation on diffusion cannot be seen from the results however the measured curves could not be modeled using a porosity of 100 and diffusion coefficient of free water this indicates that the simplified planar fracture cannot fully explain the properties of the natural and heterogeneous fracture that has a varying aperture furthermore the effect of fracture heterogeneity is seen in the difference of effective diffusion coefficients determined for c1 and c2 3 3 diffusion and sorption of sorbing nuclides the measured and modeled breakthrough curves of 133ba and 134cs to observation holes b1 c1 and c2 are shown in fig 6 no breakthrough of sorbing nuclides was observed in observation hole b2 and 134cs was observed only in the c1 that was closest to the injection hole and along the fracture all of the measured breakthrough curves were successfully modeled using tdrw simulations the breakthrough of sorbing nuclides is restrained in comparison with the breakthrough of the non sorbing nuclides however the shapes of the breakthrough curves are similar in the tdrw modeling the effective diffusion coefficients were adjusted according to the ones determined for hto by scaling it using the diffusion coefficients of 133ba and 134cs in free water d0 133ba 1 22 10 9 m2 s vitagliano and lyons 1956 and d0 134cs 2 09 10 9 m2 s friedman and kennedy 1955 and porosities from hto measurements were used then the distribution coefficients were adjusted so that agreement between measured and modeled data was found all three measured breakthrough curves of 133ba could be explained using the distribution coefficient of 1 0 0 3 10 4 m3 kg according to these results it can be concluded that the minerals adjacent to the fracture have similar sorption properties than the main rock and alteration has not changed considerably the sorption capacity of the rock compared with the intact rock the distribution coefficient of 134cs for minerals adjacent to the fracture determined from the breakthrough curve of observation hole c1 was 20 5 10 4 m3 kg 4 discussion and summary hto and 36cl reached all of the observation holes while a significant breakthrough of 134cs was found only in the hole c1 and 133ba in the holes b1 c1 and c2 furthermore it was observed that the rock core contained a fracture that crosses the holes a c1 and c2 and creates a fast transport route between these holes thus the transport parameters determined by the modeling are very different for b and c holes see table 3 the values given to observation holes b1 and b2 represent the properties of the intact rock while the values given to observation holes c1 and c2 are influenced by the fracture that was found to interconnect observation holes c1 and c2 with injection hole a due to the effect of the fracture it was not possible to model reliably the decrease of concentration in injection hole a simultaneously with the breakthrough curves to observation holes b1 b2 c1 and c2 and thus the concentration in the injection hole was used as the source concentration in the tdrw modeling see section 3 1 in general tdelab serves as good demonstration how the heterogeneity of the rock may interfere in the through diffusion measurements and how difficult it can be to determine the properties of the rock using a single hole experiments the porosities determined for the vgn sample are in agreement with the previous results for samples from repro site and other location in olkiluoto ikonen et al 2015 kuva et al 2015 sammaljärvi et al 2017 smellie et al 2014 in these studies average porosities of 0 8 0 5 ikonen et al 2015 and 0 7 0 3 smellie et al 2014 has been reported for vgn samples from the repro site and unaltered vgn samples from olkiluoto respectively hence it can be concluded that the porosity of vgn sample represents the typical values in the repro site and in olkiluoto in general smellie et al 2014 report effective diffusion coefficients of 1 0 0 4 10 13 m2 s and 0 2 0 2 10 13 m2 s for hto and 36cl respectively in unaltered vgn samples from olkiluoto while voutilainen et al 2018 report slightly higher values for hto 1 0 10 13 4 8 10 13 m2 s and 36cl 0 05 10 13 3 4 10 13 m2 s in vgn samples from the repro site the effective diffusion coefficients determined from the breakthrough curve to b1 which is one centimeter away from the injection hole are slightly larger than the previously determined values and they are possibly affected by the drilling induced opening of the micrometer scale pores and grain boundaries when preparing the injection and observation holes furthermore in short distances 2 3 times grain size the connectivity of the pore space is typically better than at longer distances 10 times grain size glover and walker 2009 for example hartikainen et al 1996 have shown that sample preparation affect the effective diffusion coefficient in short length scales however the effective diffusion coefficients determined from the breakthrough curve to b2 are reasonable and they are within the upper limit of the previous results for samples from repro site based on these considerations it can be concluded that the diffusion coefficients of hto and 36cl in the intact vgn sample are of 3 5 1 0 10 13 m2 s and 3 0 1 0 10 13 m2 s respectively in some previous experiments performed for samples from olkiluoto an effect of anion exclusion has been detected e g smellie et al 2014 voutilainen et al 2016 2018 this has been seen as a smaller effective diffusion coefficient of 36cl than of hto and is caused by electrical repulsion between negatively charged mineral surfaces and chloride ions the anion exclusion was not however observed in tdelab and the difference between the effective diffusion coefficients of 36cl and hto can be explained by the difference of their diffusion coefficients in free water lately it has been argued that the alteration state of the minerals within the transport pathways may have considerable effect on the presence of anion exclusion sammaljärvi et al 2017 the vgn sample was found to be fractured that has plausibly increased the pore apertures and thus decreased effect caused by anion exclusion it was shown that the breakthrough curves of sorbing radionuclides could be modeled by adjusting only the distribution coefficient and using the porosities and scaled effective diffusion coefficients determined from the breakthrough curves of hto this approach resulted in a perfect agreement between the measured and modeled breakthrough curves and thus completely independent fitting was not needed this demonstrates that hto and sorbing nuclides are diffusing similarly in the system if sorption is neglected and build confidence on the applied model previously muuri et al 2018 have reported the distribution coefficients of 0 1 m3 kg and 1 1 10 3 m3 kg for 133ba determined in batch sorption experiments for crushed vgn and 1 cm3 cube of vgn respectively from repro site the distribution coefficient of 133ba determined for tdelab sample is about three orders of magnitude smaller than the value for the crushed rock and one order of magnitude smaller than the value for the rock cube it is obvious that the distribution coefficients determined for crushed material overestimates the distribution coefficient of intact rock due to increased specific surface area caused by the crushing muuri et al 2018 reached the same conclusion however the difference between the results for the rock cube and tdelab is not that straight forward the main difference of the measurements is the experimental design in study performed by muuri et al 2018 the distribution coefficients are determined from the concentration decrease in surrounding tracer solution in diffusion experiment while in tdelab they are determined using the breakthrough curves in the in diffusion experiment the early part of the in diffusion curve is dominated by the sorption of the tracer on fresh mineral surfaces on the surface of the sample this is seen as a rapid drop in the concentration muuri et al 2018 this effect can also be seen in the fig 4 note that such situation also describes the case where radionuclides are being transported by fracture flow and are in contact with minerals on fracture surfaces in the through diffusion experiment the mineral surfaces inside the rock sample have greater influence on the breakthrough curve than the mineral surfaces on drill hole wall and thus the distribution coefficients determined this way better represent the distribution coefficients of intact rock note here that the distribution coefficients of 133ba determined for all measured breakthrough curves gave the same results based on this it can be concluded that the observed fracture has not affected the sorption properties of the rock in comparison with the rest of the rock if we assume that the same conclusion made above for 133ba applies also for 134cs the distribution coefficient 20 5 10 4 m3 kg can be considered as the distribution coefficient of 134cs for intact rock recent study by muuri et al 2017 show the distribution coefficients of 0 092 m3 kg and 0 031 m3 kg for 134cs determined in batch sorption experiments for crushed vgn and 1 cm3 cube of vgn respectively from repro site the distribution coefficient of 134cs determined for tdelab sample is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the value for the crushed rock and one order of magnitude smaller than the value for the rock cube the conclusions made for 133ba regarding the increase of specific surface area and effect of experimental design seem to be valid also for 134cs and thus these observations strengthen the conclusions the fact that cesium reached only one of the observation holes is due to the relatively high sorption in fact with given parameters and used total number of particles it was not possible to get any particles into the other observations holes this is consistent with the measurements unfortunately it was not possible to model the data from all of the experimental holes simultaneously and thus the measured concentrations in the injection hole were used as the source term when modeling breakthrough to observation holes however the source term remains as identical with the measured concentration see fig 4 when considering the transport of tracers from the injection hole to one of the observation holes the dominant behavior comes from the direction that has the shortest distance due to this we are able to catch the dominant behavior even though the other directions are not modeled precisely right at the same time this was demonstrated by showing that the simulations were able to reproduce the breakthrough curves similar to the measured ones this would not be the case if the dominant behavior would not be modeled correctly note that the dominant behavior is the most important from the perspective of safety assessment when considering the simplifications made in the conceptual model see fig 3 the performance of the model can be considered relatively good the properties of the fracture are obviously heavily simplified by the conceptual model looking beyond the aims and results this study the conceptual model could be improved by i characterizing the structure and properties of the fracture ii characterizing the mineral structure of the sample and iii adding effect caused by the foliation of the rock these characterizations could be performed using e g microcomputed tomography and c 14 pmma autoradiography voutilainen et al 2017 furthermore the characterization study could be combined with a detailed study of sorption of barium and cesium on different minerals of the rock this study would reveal how the sorbing nuclides have been transported in the intact rock and vicinity of the calcite filled fracture the latter study would also assist the sample analyses of the in situ experiment after the over coring 5 conclusions the through diffusion experiment in the laboratory was introduced tdelab was performed using hto 36cl 133ba and 134cs as tracers and modeled using tdrw modeling the effective diffusion coefficients and distribution coefficients of radionuclides and the porosity of the rock were determined applying the through diffusion type of experiments in the decimeter scale rock sample these parameters are of great importance when assessing the ability of bedrock to retard the transport of radionuclides towards biosphere the porosity and effective diffusion coefficients of hto and 36cl were found to be in agreement with previously determined values for repro samples the distribution coefficients of 133ba and 134cs were two to three orders of magnitude lower than those obtained previously for crushed olkiluoto rock furthermore the distribution coefficients were one order of magnitude lower than those obtained from the in diffusion experiments it was concluded that the differences are caused by increased specific surface area and sorption capacity due to crushing in the first case and different experimental design in the latter case in the future the determined porosities effective diffusion coefficients and distribution coefficients can be compared with ones from in situ tde that has similar experimental design the comparison will give information about the effect of experimental conditions on the rock properties in case there will be considerable difference in the results the comparison enables the conversion of the previous results from laboratory experiments into conditions analogous to those at the repository site furthermore the produced site specific data can be readily used in the safety assessment of the repository as conservative estimates acknowledgements the financial support by posiva oy is gratefully acknowledged 
1599,the spent nuclear fuel in finland will be deposited in crystalline granitic rock in olkiluoto finland as a part of the safety assessment of the repository series of extensive in situ sorption and diffusion experiments and supplementary laboratory work has been done in the olkiluoto site through diffusion experiment in a laboratory tdelab aims to provide applicable data for the ongoing in situ experiment in olkiluoto this laboratory scale experiment resembles the in situ experiment and aims to gain information on possible effects in values of distribution coefficients effective diffusion coefficient and porosity that are caused by differences in laboratory and in situ conditions the through diffusion and sorption of tracer solution with known activities of hto 36cl 133ba and 134cs were studied in a decimeter scale sample of veined gneiss which is one of the main rock types in olkiluoto the measured breakthrough curves were modeled taking into account the porosity of the rock and diffusion and sorption of the radionuclides using time domain random walk tdrw simulations the porosities of 0 7 0 8 were determined for the rock and effective diffusion coefficients of 3 5 1 0 10 13 m2 s and 3 0 1 0 10 13 m2 s were determined for hto and 36cl respectively the porosity and effective diffusion coefficients were found to be in agreement with previous results for veined gneiss furthermore distribution coefficients of 1 0 0 3 10 4 m3 kg and 2 0 0 5 10 3 m3 kg were determined for 133ba and 134cs respectively using information about the effective diffusion coefficient determined for hto the distribution coefficients were found to be significantly smaller than the ones determined for crushed rock in previous studies and slightly smaller than the ones from previous in diffusion experiments keywords diffusion sorption porosity crystalline rock radionuclides time domain random walk 1 introduction the final disposal of spent nuclear fuel snf from present nuclear power plants in finland olkiluoto and loviisa is planned to take place in a crystalline granitic rock at olkiluoto island eurajoki finland posiva 2012 the snf will be protected by a multiple barrier system if released into the bedrock radionuclides will be transported mostly by advection along water conducting fractures the transport of the radionuclides will be retarded by molecular diffusion from the fractures into the stagnant matrix pore water and or by sorption onto mineral surfaces in the rock matrix neretnieks 1980 kekäläinen et al 2011 wels et al 1996 to resolve the magnitude of the retardation the properties of the bedrock in respect of different radionuclides have to be carefully determined for the safety assessment of the final disposal cesium is a highly soluble alkali metal occurring in the snf and its inventories in the snf are among the highest of all radionuclides 135cs is one of the critical radionuclides when considering the long term safety of the final disposal due to its long half life posiva 2013 this makes the cesium retention properties of the bedrock of great interest in the safety assessment for the final disposal of snf in deep repositories in this work 134cs was chosen as an analogue for 135cs barium is often used as a chemical analogue for radium which has a radioactive isotope 226ra with high importance in the safety assessment of the spent fuel deposition due to the ingrowth from uranium nilsson and papp 1980 the 226ra activity will reach a maximum approximately 300 000 years after the deposition of the snf grandia et al 2008 understanding the transport properties of barium and radium in the bedrock is of importance for the safety assessment of the repository barium and cesium are known to be sorbing elements in the repository conditions and sorb by ion exchange mechanism molinero and samper 2006 kyllönen et al 2014 furthermore hto and 36cl are commonly used as non sorbing radionuclides when studying the properties of bedrock hou and roos 2008 because they represent natural elements in the groundwater smellie et al 2014 they are assumed to not have chemical reaction on the mineral surfaces in granitic rock ikonen et al 2016a furthermore 36cl has great interest in the safety assessment due to its long half live and high mobility in the bedrock in situ experiments are important in order to determine the diffusion and distribution coefficient of bedrock in conditions analogous to those at the repository site however in situ experiments are costly and time consuming hence it is equally important to compare in situ results with the laboratory experiments to better assess their relevancy the in situ diffusion experiments have been performed in several countries e g finland poteri et al 2018 voutilainen et al 2014 sweden andersson et al 2004 nilsson et al 2010 widestrand et al 2010 and switzerland ikonen et al 2016a soler et al 2015 to demonstrate the behavior of radionuclides in crystalline bedrock in switzerland the retention of several radionuclides was studied in situ in grimsel granodiorite through a long term diffusion ltd experiment ikonen et al 2016a soler et al 2015 ikonen et al 2017 reported that the effective diffusion coefficients measured in laboratory and in situ experiments for grimsel granodiorite do not differ considerably from each other on the other hand soler et al 2015 report results from the same experiments that show laboratory effective diffusion coefficients that are a factor of 3 larger than the in situ coefficients only results by japan atomic energy agency are considered here since they are the only group that reports both laboratory and in situ results in addition recent experiments performed in olkiluoto finland do not show differences between the effective diffusion coefficients determined using the laboratory and in situ experiments poteri et al 2018 however the designs of the experimental setups used in the laboratory and in situ experiments differ in above mentioned studies furthermore in similar in situ experiment long term diffusion experiment ltde the retention of 22 radionuclides was studied at the äspö hard rock laboratory sweden nilsson et al 2010 widestrand et al 2010 the focus of ltde was more directed towards sorption rather than diffusion due to the relatively short experimental time of about six months the in diffusion curves have turned out to be rather difficult to explain due to the experimental design and effect of heterogeneity of the rock iraola et al 2017 park and ji 2018 a project called rock matrix retention properties repro at onkalo the underground rock characterization facility in olkiluoto finland consists of extensive series of in situ sorption and diffusion measurements that are supplemented by laboratory work aalto et al 2009 one of these in situ experiments is a through diffusion experiment tde launched in the autumn of 2015 for studying the diffusion of hto 36cl 22na 133ba and 134cs in the olkiluoto bedrock aromaa et al 2018 the aim of the repro in situ tde is to quantify diffusivity and the connected porosity of the unaltered rock matrix in the repository level stress conditions the experimental setup consists of three parallel drill holes where one is used as an injection hole decreasing concentrations measured and the breakthroughs of radionuclides to two observation drill holes are followed voutilainen et al 2014 in this study the aim has been to perform a replica of the in situ experiment in the laboratory the through diffusion experiment in the laboratory tdelab aims to study the through diffusion of hto 36cl 133ba and 134cs in veined gneiss sample resembling the olkiluoto bedrock and provide comparable data for the ongoing in situ tde often studies that aim to determine the effective diffusion coefficients and distribution coefficients are performed in the laboratory conditions recently such studies have been performed for samples e g from finland voutilainen et al 2016 muuri et al 2018 sweden widestrand et al 2007 japan tachi et al 2011 czech republic videnská et al 2015 switzerland tachi et al 2015 muuri et al 2016 and canada vilks et al 2003 typically the distribution coefficients have been measured using crushed material and batch sorption experiments however many of the recent studies show that the crushing increases the specific surface area and sorption capacity of the material which leads to an over estimation of the distribution coefficients andré et al 2009 muuri et al 2017 2018 puukko et al 2018 to this end it is important to determine distribution coefficients for intact rock when performing long term experiments with sorbing nuclides and intact rock the analysis of the results becomes more complicated since often diffusion has to be taken into account one possibility to model such experiments with taking into account the heterogeneity of the rock and other experimental details is to use time domain random walk tdrw method the method was originally developed for simulating transport in heterogeneous media mccarthy 1993 delay et al 2002 the tdrw method is a rapid particle tracking method where a particle is forced to jump to a neighboring point during a certain random transition time which makes it faster than the traditional particle tracking methods sardini et al 2003 the method has been used to study the effect of structural heterogeneities on diffusion in various cases sardini et al 2007 robinet et al 2012 voutilainen et al 2013 recently the method has been developed so that it is now possible to take into account sorption applying linear kd dentz et al 2012 ikonen et al 2016b voutilainen et al 2017 and flow in fractured media gjetvaj et al 2015 noetinger et al 2016 the method has also been found to be a powerful tool for analyzing the results of both in situ and laboratory experiments especially when initial or boundary conditions are complicated voutilainen et al 2013 soler et al 2015 ikonen et al 2017 due to the recent developments and demonstrated capability to model similar experiments the tdrw method was chosen as the modeling tool for determining the transport parameters from the measured data the aim of tdelab has been to study the diffusion and sorption of hto 36cl 133ba and 134cs and to determine retention parameters effective diffusion coefficient porosity and distribution coefficient for the intact crystalline rock sample from the repro site later these results can be compared with results from in situ tde that is being performed at repository level and with similar experimental design as tdelab by using a sample geometry resembling the in situ tde one can get comparable information about the effect of experimental conditions on the rock properties furthermore the aim is to produce site specific data for the safety assessment of the repository 2 materials and methods 2 1 rock samples the olkiluoto site is situated in south western finland on the coast of the baltic sea the repro niche where the in situ experiments are performed is located in 420 m below the surface and the bedrock in the site is pegmatitic granite and migmatitic gneiss subgroup veined gneiss pegmatitic granite is from light grey to pale colored with coarse k feldspar and commonly also cordierite and garnet pitkänen et al 1996 aaltonen et al 2016 veined gneiss was chosen for this experiment because it represents the same rock material that surrounds the in situ tde bore holes sammaljärvi et al 2017 the veined gneiss shows a weak to moderate banded foliation but locally also irregular foliation the main minerals of veined gneiss are quartz plagioclase biotite and potassium feldspar kärki and paulamäki 2006 the mineral composition of the bedrock has been shown to be an important factor for the overall sorption properties of the rock kuva et al 2018 muuri et al 2016 puukko et al 2018 2 2 experimental setup experimental setup resembled the in situ tde ongoing in olkiluoto finland voutilainen et al 2014 tracer solution with known activities was injected to an injection hole and the diffusion and sorption of radionuclides from the injection hole water were analyzed the breakthroughs of the tracer into four observation holes were monitored the rock sample shown in fig 1 was veined gneiss with strong foliation seen vertically in the fig 1 the rock block was 30 cm in height and 30 cm in diameter the injection hole marked as a in the fig 1 was drilled in the middle of the rock and four observation holes were drilled around it observation holes b1 and c1 were 1 cm away from the injection hole and b2 and c2 were 4 cm away from the injection hole two of the observation holes b1 and b2 were located so that the main direction of diffusion was perpendicular to the foliation and two other c1 and c2 so that it was along the foliation the rock sample was saturated with synthetic repro groundwater see table 1 for five months before starting the experiment saturation was done by placing the rock sample in an experimental chamber that was filled with synthetic repro groundwater so that the upmost 1 8 cm of the rock sample was still over the water table in addition all five holes in the rock sample were filled with synthetic repro groundwater the injection hole had a water volume of 63 ml whereas water volumes of the observation holes ranged from 13 to 14 5 ml all holes were sealed with rubber caps to avoid evaporation during the saturation synthetic repro groundwater was added to the holes twice a week to replace a decrease of water level after saturation time of two months the upper surface of the sample was completely moist due to capillary fringe and the rock sample was covered with epoxy resin in three stages first the bottom of the sample was sealed this was followed by sealing of the lateral surface and the upper surface the sealing was performed to ensure the complete saturation of the rock sample and to prevent the transport of radionuclides through the surface of the sample during the experiment saturation was continued after the epoxy treatment for two month by filling the experimental chamber half way with synthetic repro groundwater and the injection hole and four observation holes were also filled with synthetic repro groundwater during this phase the air was let to escape from the upper surface of the sample one month before the injection the upper surface of the sample was sealed during the last phase of saturation it was made sure that the water level did not change in the experimental holes in order to ensure stationary conditions during the saturation of the sample it was observed that the holes a c1 and c2 were interconnected by a fracture that can be seen in the upper part of fig 1 the fracture was also observed in the drill cores samples the examination of the drill core revealed that the fracture was of natural origin and that it had calcite filling the fracture groundwater in the olkiluoto site is mainly of na cl type with ph of 7 3 8 0 the groundwater is brackish at the depths from 40 m to 500 m concentrations of 9 0 10 4 to 1 1 mg l of stable natural cesium and 8 1 10 2 to 2 6 mg l of stable natural barium has been measured from olkiluoto groundwater in previous studies hellä et al 2014 synthetic repro groundwater ph 7 6 resembling the olkiluoto groundwater in repro site was prepared for this experiment see table 1 it was decided to use simple simulant to represent the olkiluoto groundwater because the chemical composition of this simulant is similar to the onk pp319 groundwater for the major elements which are chlorine sodium and calcium other elements have concentrations so small that they do not have a significant effect on the salinity of the water for this experiment the synthetic repro groundwater contains all the elements from the olkiluoto groundwater that are of importance for the diffusion and sorption studies of hto 36cl 133ba and 134cs at the beginning of the experiment the solution in the injection hole was replaced by 63 ml of tracer solution radioactive nuclides used in this experiment were hto 36cl 133ba and 134cs the ratios of the radionuclide activities was chosen to resemble the ratios used in the in situ tde table 2 shows the initial activities and concentration of hto 36cl 133ba and 134cs used in tdelab the concentrations of the radionuclides are relatively low and do not affect the concentrations given in table 1 in in situ tde 22na was also used but in tdelab it was left out due to its high radiotoxicity in laboratory conditions usually in this type of experiments 22na is used for the online monitoring of the breakthrough which was not necessary in this experiment due to continuous sampling the sampling of the injection hole was started one hour after the injection the injection hole was sampled more frequently for the first two weeks during which total of 12 samples were collected after the first two weeks the injection hole was sampled every two weeks injection hole water sample volume was 0 1 ml and the sample volume was replaced with pure synthetic repro groundwater in every sampling the 0 1 ml injection hole water sample was diluted to 5 ml with synthetic repro groundwater to achieve a calibrated sample geometry of gamma measurement the activities of the samples were decay corrected to the activity at moment of the injection according to the half lives given in table 2 water level remained constant in all experimental holes during the experiment indicating that there advection did not affect the results and the transport of tracers was purely caused by diffusion 2 3 water analyses 3h radioactive nuclide in hto and 36cl are pure beta emitters and their activities were measured with liquid scintillation counting lsc perkin elmer tri carb 2910 tr spectrum analyzer spectraworks however gamma emitting radionuclides 133ba and 134cs also have beta or electron emissions that will interfere 3h and 36cl measurements therefore in order to measure beta emitting 3h and 36cl from the groundwater solution the gamma emitting radionuclides need to be separated from them the separation was done according to an analysis method developed for the in situ tde groundwater samples aromaa et al 2018 shown in fig 2 the activities of gamma emitting radionuclides 133ba and 134cs were measured with a hpge detector canberra xtra extended range coaxial hpge detector with spectral analysis program gamma acquisition and analysis genie canberra after gamma measurement 1 ml subsample a1 of the injection hole water sample was taken for the analysis of 36cl activity the subsample was diluted to 5 ml by milliq h2o deionized using milli q millipore co and 36cl was separated from it by agno3 precipitation precipitation was performed by adding 0 5 ml of 2 mol l agno3 solution to the a1 sample the chlorine concentration of the synthetic repro groundwater 5000 mg l secures high enough chlorine content in the a1 sample so that no additional carrier is needed the chlorine concentration in the a1 sample is 0 14 m and the agno3 concentration is 0 2 m which is enough for the precipitation of all chlorine in the sample as agcl the precipitate was washed twice with 5 ml milliq h2o to ensure a clean sample for lsc the agcl precipitate was dissolved in 5 ml ammonia and measured with the hpge detector for any gamma emitting residue that might have been left in the sample bottle the 36cl sample clean from disturbing spectral components was mixed with 15 ml of liquid scintillation cocktail optiphase hisafe 3 perkin elmer and measured with lsc yields of 98 2 for agcl precipitation was determined in the previous work for similar water samples aromaa et al 2018 for the separation of hto another 1 ml subsample a2 of the injection hole water sample was diluted to 10 ml with milliq h2o hto was separated from the a2 subsample by distillation the 10 ml sample was heated with a thermophore and the vapor was condensed in a water circulation condenser distillate that contained tritium as tritiated water hto was collected into a round bottomed flask 5 ml aliquot of the distillate was measured with the hpge detector for any gamma emitting residue the clean residue was mixed with 15 ml liquid scintillation cocktail and measured with lsc for 3h activity the 10 ml distillation sample as well as the distillate were weighed for recovery determination in the previous work the recoveries of 74 6 for distillation were achieved for similar water samples aromaa et al 2018 observation holes were sampled once a week a 5 ml subsample of the water was used for the analysis of gamma emitting radionuclides 133ba and 134cs by using the hpge detector in case of no gamma emitting radionuclides in the observation hole water sample the subsample was mixed with 15 ml of liquid scintillation cocktail and the activities of 3h and 36cl were measured directly with lsc using separation of 3h and 36cl by their β energies in case of a disturbing beta electron emitters in the water sample the separation of hto and 36cl was in the same way as the injection hole water samples 2 4 time domain random walk simulations it is not possible to analyze the results of the diffusion experiments using analytical tools due to complicated geometries of the experimental systems and sampling procedure of the injection and observation holes we modeled the transport of tracer nuclides using the tdrw method as this approach can handle heterogeneous geometries and concentrations the approach is also generally convenient with large systems since computation times do not considerably depend on sample size and it is faster than more traditional simulation methods sardini et al 2003 a more detailed description of the theory is given by delay et al 2002 sardini et al 2003 and voutilainen et al 2017 so only a brief outline is given here a diffusing unit of mass is defined as a particle which is forced to jump during a transition time to one of its neighboring voxel on a mesh defining the diffusion space the transition probability pij of a particle in a voxel i to a neighboring voxel j is defined by 1 p ij b ij j b ij where 2 b ij a ij d e ij l ij with aij the total area between the voxels i and j de ij the harmonic mean of the effective diffusion coefficient de at voxels i and j and lij the distance between the centers of the voxels i and j the transition probability of a jump by a particle at a site i is taken into account such that reaching the target site takes certain time the transition time which depends on the properties of the two voxels the transition time for a jump from the voxel i to the voxel j is given by 3 t i j ε i v i j b ij log u 01 where vi is the total volume of the voxel i and u01 a random number from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 the eq 3 defines the transition time due to diffusion from the voxel i to the voxel j but it does not take into account possible sorption of the particles recently voutilainen et al 2017 developed the tdrw method further so that it is possible to account for the sorption of particles using kd concept the distribution coefficients kd are typically measured for geological samples and they define the chemical strength of sorption voutilainen et al 2017 proposed expression for sorption time ts during the transition 4 t s ε i v i j w ij log u 01 ε i v i j b ij log u 01 where 5 w ij a ij εd a ij l ij with εda ij the harmonic mean of the product of porosity and apparent diffusion coefficient da at the voxels i and j in da the effect of sorption is taken into account 6 d a d e ε 1 ε ρ k d where ρ is the density of rock a 3d 8 bit greyscale image was constructed for the simulations using imagej the 3d image was used as the simulation geometry where voxels formed a simulation mesh the grayscale image has 256 possible grayscale values for each voxel the mesh was created according to the actual dimensions of the rock sample so that one voxel represents 1 1 1 mm3 sized cube this led to a cylindrical simulation mesh with the size of 290 290 280 see fig 3a in the 3d image each component rock fracture injection hole and observation holes were colored with a unique grey scale value see fig 3b which was linked to its porosity diffusion coefficient and distribution coefficient unique grey values were also used to assist the sampling during the simulation by checking the grey value of the voxel where the particle is located after experimental sampling time has been reached see steps 3 and 4 in simulation procedure below due to the observed fracture interconnecting holes a c1 and c2 see sec 2 2 a simple planar fracture with individual properties was added into the simulation mesh see fig 3 the real fracture is of course more heterogeneous and it is simplified in our conceptual model the effective diffusion de and porosity of the intact rock and the fracture applying hto and 36cl data were first modeled using the measured concentration of injection hole as source this was followed by determination of the distribution coefficients of intact rock and fracture coatings for 133ba and 134cs by assuming the same de and porosity as for hto here the distribution coefficient of the intact rock and fracture coating were varied in order to find agreement between measured and modeled breakthrough curves the simulations were done using 5 105 particles for the non sorbing nuclides and 1 106 for the sorbing nuclides the initial position for each particle was chosen randomly in the injection hole the porosity diffusion coefficient and distribution coefficient in the injection and observation holes were set to 100 d0 in free water and no sorption applied respectively during the simulation following procedure was repeated until a preset total diffusion time was elapsed 1 determine the direction of a jump according to the transition probabilities see eq 1 and a selected random number 2 determine transition and sorption times according to eqs 3 and 4 and a second random number 3 check if experimental sampling time has passed during the jump if not return to point 1 4 check if the particle is in one of the holes if not return to point 1 5 record the location of particle and remove part of the particles according to a third random number the ratio of removed particles is set according to the sample volume and total volume of the hole in which the particle is currently located 6 check if total diffusion time is elapsed if not return to point 1 the fitting of simulated curves to experimental curves was performed by determining the sum of squared deviation for each parameter pair and by finding a minimum of the sum least squared approach the confidence limits for simulated curves were defined so that the measured curves remained within the limits and that concentration changes in the injection and observation holes could be explained using similar values for the porosity effective diffusion coefficient and distribution coefficient in case of sorbing nuclides 3 results 3 1 injection hole total of 34 samples were collected from injection hole a during 39 weeks experimental time the activities of gamma emitting 133ba and 134cs were measured with the hpge detector activities of hto and 36cl were determined by separating the radionuclides from 133ba and 134cs separated hto and 36cl were measured with lsc without spectral interferences fig 4 shows the decrease of the relative concentrations of four radionuclides in the injection hole as a function of time in fig 4 the concentrations of 133ba and 134cs decreased rapidly at the beginning of the experiment especially the concentration of 134cs decreased to almost tenth of its original value during the first month of the experiment the decrease of 133ba was more modest and the concentration decreased to sixth of the original value during the first month of the experiment the rapid decrease in the activities of 133ba and 134cs can be explained by their strong sorption onto mineral surfaces that are in direct contact with tracer solution the rapid drop is followed by a steady decrease of concentration due to in diffusion into rock and sorption on minerals surfaces within the transport routes the difference between the relative concentrations of 133ba and 134cs can be explained by a difference in their distribution coefficients the concentrations of hto and 36cl decrease modestly during the whole experiment the steady decrease is caused by in diffusion into the rock and relatively small effective diffusion coefficient a slight difference in the decrease rate between hto and 36cl can be explained by the difference in the diffusion coefficients in water what is slightly lower for 36cl d0 hto 2 22 10 9 m2 s jones et al 1965 and d0 cl 36 2 06 10 9 m2 s hawlicka 1987 after 39 weeks of the experiment only 4 9 of 134cs 4 9 if sample collection is taken into account and 17 6 of 133ba 17 9 was left in the injection hole from the non sorbing hto and 36cl radionuclides 54 56 and 63 66 respectively was left in the injection hole in the end of the experiment during the saturation it was observed that the holes a c1 and c2 were interconnected by a fracture furthermore it is known that veined gneiss samples from olkiluoto have structure with banded foliation and that transport of elements may be different across and along the foliation kärki and paulamäki 2006 due to the presence of the fracture possible effect of foliation and heterogeneity of vgn voutilainen et al 2019 it was not possible to model data from both injection and observation holes simultaneously hence the measured concentrations in the injection hole were used as the source term in the tdrw modeling see solid lines in fig 4 in the simulations the correct boundary condition was kept by adding particles to or removing them from the injection hole if needed at each measurement point see fig 4 3 2 diffusion of non sorbing nuclides observation holes were sampled once a week starting from one week from the injection total of 39 samples were collected per observation hole during 39 weeks experimental time the breakthrough curves were modeled by tdrw method using the measured concentration in injection hole a as a source fig 5 shows the measured and modeled breakthrough curves for hto and 36cl to observation holes b1 b2 c1 and c2 breakthrough of hto and 36cl was observed in all four observation holes and the breakthrough curves were successfully modeled using tdrw simulations the breakthrough curves of hto and 36cl are similar for all of the observation holes see fig 5 and the transport of these non sorbing nuclides does not depend on radionuclide in question the breakthrough of hto tends to be slightly faster than of 36cl this can be explained by small difference in the diffusion coefficients in water the values for the effective diffusion coefficient and porosity determined from the observation holes b1 and b2 represent the properties of intact rock see table 3 there is a small difference in the effective diffusion coefficients of hto and 36cl determined from observation holes b1 and b2 the difference is caused by the difference in diffusion coefficients in free water furthermore the uncertainties of the effective diffusion coefficients overlap the effective diffusion coefficients determined from the breakthrough curves of b1 are about a factor of two larger than of b2 the porosities determined from these breakthrough curves are in agreement the values determined from the breakthrough curves of hto and 36cl to the observation holes c1 and c2 represent mostly the properties of the fracture and are about two orders of magnitude higher than those of the intact rock see table 3 clearly the observed fracture increases the transport in the direction of foliation and thus the effect of foliation on diffusion cannot be seen from the results however the measured curves could not be modeled using a porosity of 100 and diffusion coefficient of free water this indicates that the simplified planar fracture cannot fully explain the properties of the natural and heterogeneous fracture that has a varying aperture furthermore the effect of fracture heterogeneity is seen in the difference of effective diffusion coefficients determined for c1 and c2 3 3 diffusion and sorption of sorbing nuclides the measured and modeled breakthrough curves of 133ba and 134cs to observation holes b1 c1 and c2 are shown in fig 6 no breakthrough of sorbing nuclides was observed in observation hole b2 and 134cs was observed only in the c1 that was closest to the injection hole and along the fracture all of the measured breakthrough curves were successfully modeled using tdrw simulations the breakthrough of sorbing nuclides is restrained in comparison with the breakthrough of the non sorbing nuclides however the shapes of the breakthrough curves are similar in the tdrw modeling the effective diffusion coefficients were adjusted according to the ones determined for hto by scaling it using the diffusion coefficients of 133ba and 134cs in free water d0 133ba 1 22 10 9 m2 s vitagliano and lyons 1956 and d0 134cs 2 09 10 9 m2 s friedman and kennedy 1955 and porosities from hto measurements were used then the distribution coefficients were adjusted so that agreement between measured and modeled data was found all three measured breakthrough curves of 133ba could be explained using the distribution coefficient of 1 0 0 3 10 4 m3 kg according to these results it can be concluded that the minerals adjacent to the fracture have similar sorption properties than the main rock and alteration has not changed considerably the sorption capacity of the rock compared with the intact rock the distribution coefficient of 134cs for minerals adjacent to the fracture determined from the breakthrough curve of observation hole c1 was 20 5 10 4 m3 kg 4 discussion and summary hto and 36cl reached all of the observation holes while a significant breakthrough of 134cs was found only in the hole c1 and 133ba in the holes b1 c1 and c2 furthermore it was observed that the rock core contained a fracture that crosses the holes a c1 and c2 and creates a fast transport route between these holes thus the transport parameters determined by the modeling are very different for b and c holes see table 3 the values given to observation holes b1 and b2 represent the properties of the intact rock while the values given to observation holes c1 and c2 are influenced by the fracture that was found to interconnect observation holes c1 and c2 with injection hole a due to the effect of the fracture it was not possible to model reliably the decrease of concentration in injection hole a simultaneously with the breakthrough curves to observation holes b1 b2 c1 and c2 and thus the concentration in the injection hole was used as the source concentration in the tdrw modeling see section 3 1 in general tdelab serves as good demonstration how the heterogeneity of the rock may interfere in the through diffusion measurements and how difficult it can be to determine the properties of the rock using a single hole experiments the porosities determined for the vgn sample are in agreement with the previous results for samples from repro site and other location in olkiluoto ikonen et al 2015 kuva et al 2015 sammaljärvi et al 2017 smellie et al 2014 in these studies average porosities of 0 8 0 5 ikonen et al 2015 and 0 7 0 3 smellie et al 2014 has been reported for vgn samples from the repro site and unaltered vgn samples from olkiluoto respectively hence it can be concluded that the porosity of vgn sample represents the typical values in the repro site and in olkiluoto in general smellie et al 2014 report effective diffusion coefficients of 1 0 0 4 10 13 m2 s and 0 2 0 2 10 13 m2 s for hto and 36cl respectively in unaltered vgn samples from olkiluoto while voutilainen et al 2018 report slightly higher values for hto 1 0 10 13 4 8 10 13 m2 s and 36cl 0 05 10 13 3 4 10 13 m2 s in vgn samples from the repro site the effective diffusion coefficients determined from the breakthrough curve to b1 which is one centimeter away from the injection hole are slightly larger than the previously determined values and they are possibly affected by the drilling induced opening of the micrometer scale pores and grain boundaries when preparing the injection and observation holes furthermore in short distances 2 3 times grain size the connectivity of the pore space is typically better than at longer distances 10 times grain size glover and walker 2009 for example hartikainen et al 1996 have shown that sample preparation affect the effective diffusion coefficient in short length scales however the effective diffusion coefficients determined from the breakthrough curve to b2 are reasonable and they are within the upper limit of the previous results for samples from repro site based on these considerations it can be concluded that the diffusion coefficients of hto and 36cl in the intact vgn sample are of 3 5 1 0 10 13 m2 s and 3 0 1 0 10 13 m2 s respectively in some previous experiments performed for samples from olkiluoto an effect of anion exclusion has been detected e g smellie et al 2014 voutilainen et al 2016 2018 this has been seen as a smaller effective diffusion coefficient of 36cl than of hto and is caused by electrical repulsion between negatively charged mineral surfaces and chloride ions the anion exclusion was not however observed in tdelab and the difference between the effective diffusion coefficients of 36cl and hto can be explained by the difference of their diffusion coefficients in free water lately it has been argued that the alteration state of the minerals within the transport pathways may have considerable effect on the presence of anion exclusion sammaljärvi et al 2017 the vgn sample was found to be fractured that has plausibly increased the pore apertures and thus decreased effect caused by anion exclusion it was shown that the breakthrough curves of sorbing radionuclides could be modeled by adjusting only the distribution coefficient and using the porosities and scaled effective diffusion coefficients determined from the breakthrough curves of hto this approach resulted in a perfect agreement between the measured and modeled breakthrough curves and thus completely independent fitting was not needed this demonstrates that hto and sorbing nuclides are diffusing similarly in the system if sorption is neglected and build confidence on the applied model previously muuri et al 2018 have reported the distribution coefficients of 0 1 m3 kg and 1 1 10 3 m3 kg for 133ba determined in batch sorption experiments for crushed vgn and 1 cm3 cube of vgn respectively from repro site the distribution coefficient of 133ba determined for tdelab sample is about three orders of magnitude smaller than the value for the crushed rock and one order of magnitude smaller than the value for the rock cube it is obvious that the distribution coefficients determined for crushed material overestimates the distribution coefficient of intact rock due to increased specific surface area caused by the crushing muuri et al 2018 reached the same conclusion however the difference between the results for the rock cube and tdelab is not that straight forward the main difference of the measurements is the experimental design in study performed by muuri et al 2018 the distribution coefficients are determined from the concentration decrease in surrounding tracer solution in diffusion experiment while in tdelab they are determined using the breakthrough curves in the in diffusion experiment the early part of the in diffusion curve is dominated by the sorption of the tracer on fresh mineral surfaces on the surface of the sample this is seen as a rapid drop in the concentration muuri et al 2018 this effect can also be seen in the fig 4 note that such situation also describes the case where radionuclides are being transported by fracture flow and are in contact with minerals on fracture surfaces in the through diffusion experiment the mineral surfaces inside the rock sample have greater influence on the breakthrough curve than the mineral surfaces on drill hole wall and thus the distribution coefficients determined this way better represent the distribution coefficients of intact rock note here that the distribution coefficients of 133ba determined for all measured breakthrough curves gave the same results based on this it can be concluded that the observed fracture has not affected the sorption properties of the rock in comparison with the rest of the rock if we assume that the same conclusion made above for 133ba applies also for 134cs the distribution coefficient 20 5 10 4 m3 kg can be considered as the distribution coefficient of 134cs for intact rock recent study by muuri et al 2017 show the distribution coefficients of 0 092 m3 kg and 0 031 m3 kg for 134cs determined in batch sorption experiments for crushed vgn and 1 cm3 cube of vgn respectively from repro site the distribution coefficient of 134cs determined for tdelab sample is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the value for the crushed rock and one order of magnitude smaller than the value for the rock cube the conclusions made for 133ba regarding the increase of specific surface area and effect of experimental design seem to be valid also for 134cs and thus these observations strengthen the conclusions the fact that cesium reached only one of the observation holes is due to the relatively high sorption in fact with given parameters and used total number of particles it was not possible to get any particles into the other observations holes this is consistent with the measurements unfortunately it was not possible to model the data from all of the experimental holes simultaneously and thus the measured concentrations in the injection hole were used as the source term when modeling breakthrough to observation holes however the source term remains as identical with the measured concentration see fig 4 when considering the transport of tracers from the injection hole to one of the observation holes the dominant behavior comes from the direction that has the shortest distance due to this we are able to catch the dominant behavior even though the other directions are not modeled precisely right at the same time this was demonstrated by showing that the simulations were able to reproduce the breakthrough curves similar to the measured ones this would not be the case if the dominant behavior would not be modeled correctly note that the dominant behavior is the most important from the perspective of safety assessment when considering the simplifications made in the conceptual model see fig 3 the performance of the model can be considered relatively good the properties of the fracture are obviously heavily simplified by the conceptual model looking beyond the aims and results this study the conceptual model could be improved by i characterizing the structure and properties of the fracture ii characterizing the mineral structure of the sample and iii adding effect caused by the foliation of the rock these characterizations could be performed using e g microcomputed tomography and c 14 pmma autoradiography voutilainen et al 2017 furthermore the characterization study could be combined with a detailed study of sorption of barium and cesium on different minerals of the rock this study would reveal how the sorbing nuclides have been transported in the intact rock and vicinity of the calcite filled fracture the latter study would also assist the sample analyses of the in situ experiment after the over coring 5 conclusions the through diffusion experiment in the laboratory was introduced tdelab was performed using hto 36cl 133ba and 134cs as tracers and modeled using tdrw modeling the effective diffusion coefficients and distribution coefficients of radionuclides and the porosity of the rock were determined applying the through diffusion type of experiments in the decimeter scale rock sample these parameters are of great importance when assessing the ability of bedrock to retard the transport of radionuclides towards biosphere the porosity and effective diffusion coefficients of hto and 36cl were found to be in agreement with previously determined values for repro samples the distribution coefficients of 133ba and 134cs were two to three orders of magnitude lower than those obtained previously for crushed olkiluoto rock furthermore the distribution coefficients were one order of magnitude lower than those obtained from the in diffusion experiments it was concluded that the differences are caused by increased specific surface area and sorption capacity due to crushing in the first case and different experimental design in the latter case in the future the determined porosities effective diffusion coefficients and distribution coefficients can be compared with ones from in situ tde that has similar experimental design the comparison will give information about the effect of experimental conditions on the rock properties in case there will be considerable difference in the results the comparison enables the conversion of the previous results from laboratory experiments into conditions analogous to those at the repository site furthermore the produced site specific data can be readily used in the safety assessment
