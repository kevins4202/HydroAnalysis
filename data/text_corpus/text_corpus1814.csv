9070,this paper established hybrid prediction models based on variational mode decomposition vmd empirical mode decomposition emd and ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd combined with the backpropagation neural network model bpnn to improve the prediction accuracy of reference crop evapotranspiration et0 time series with the characteristics of nonlinearity and instability the daily et0 data of 11 representative stations in xinjiang from 1993 to 2016 were selected for model training and testing and compared with the results of support vector regression svr and gradient boosting regression tree gbrt as the two empirical machine learning models the results indicated the superiority of the vmd bpnn hybrid prediction model to emd bpnn and eemd bpnn in terms of accuracy and stability with root mean square error rmse 0 405 mm d mean absolute error mae 0 268 mm d and coefficient of determination r2 0 979 when employing the vmd bpnn model to forecast et0 for seven days the rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse of the vmd bpnn model were 0 588 mm d and 0 952 respectively and the prediction results indicated high precision and reliability the prediction accuracy of the vmd bpnn model was significantly higher than that of single machine learning models such as bpnn svr and gbrt the rmse and mae values of the vmd bpnn model were more than 60 smaller than bpnn svr and gbrt models and r2 and nse were approximately 18 higher than bpnn svr and gbrt models respectively this demonstrates the effectiveness of the vmd method in reducing the non stationarity of the original daily et0 data the bpnn model predicted the decomposed data series and the prediction accuracy and stability were significantly enhanced this indicates the high reliability of the vmd bpnn model and its capability for et0 prediction in xinjiang keywords reference crop evapotranspiration prediction model decomposition algorithm neural network xinjiang region data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction urbanization development and the rapid growth of the population have accelerated the competition with agriculture water resources especially in arid and semi arid regions martí et al 2015 the efficient utilization of agricultural water resources is crucial for alleviating the water crisis as a significant factor in the hydrological cycle evapotranspiration et plays an essential role in irrigation management and design feng et al 2017b qiu et al 2019 the et could be obtained by the crop coefficient method with the product of the crop coefficient kc and the reference crop evapotranspiration et0 fan et al 2018 wang et al 2020 which was proposed by the food and agriculture organization fao to estimate crop evapotranspiration under standard condition etc allen et al 1998 therefore if the et0 is accurately predicted the et for different corps would be calculated in the future which is benefit for optimizing agricultural water resource allocation in advance formulating more accurate irrigation systems and improving the water resources utilization efficiency with the continuous development of computer technology many scholars have predicted and estimated et0 using artificial intelligence algorithms e g machine learning model salam and islam 2020 zhang et al 2020 elbeltagi et al 2022 the machine learning model can provide a more straightforward solution for nonlinear multivariable problems wu et al 2019 the numerical simulation method has the advantages of short time high precision and strong generalization ability elbeltagi et al 2021 feng et al 2016 mousavi et al 2015 kumar et al 2002 first introduced an artificial neural network to calculate et0 landeras et al 2008a utilized an artificial neural network ann in processing nonlinear data to simulate the reference crop evapotranspiration and found its excellent performance in simulating and calculating et0 tabari et al 2012 employed the support vector machine svm adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis multiple linear regression mlr and multiple nonlinear regression mnlr to establish an et0 simulation model which outperformed the blaney criddle and hargreaves and jensen haise models petković et al 2016 employed a radial basis function network with particle swarm optimization rbfn pso and a radial basis function network with backpropagation rbfn bp to estimate the et0 of serbia they demonstrated the superiority of the above methods to ann and svm in terms of statistical characteristics feng et al 2017a employed random forest rf and generalized regression neural network grnn models to estimate the daily et0 in southwest china although both models could well predict daily et0 the prediction effect of the rf model was slightly superior to that of the grnn model zhang et al 2020 established an algorithm for gradient boosting on decision trees catboost to accurately predict and simulate the daily et0 and the calculation accuracy was higher than that of grnn and rf models adnan et al 2021 established a novel hybrid adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis wcamfo in a tropical humid area with limited data to predict the monthly et0 with high accuracy and low error it is worth noting that backpropagation neural network bpnn may have shortcomings such as overfitting and falling into a local minimum wu et al 2020 especially in et0 simulation prediction the accuracy of prediction results was slightly low due to the high heterogeneity of evaporation data since a single ann prediction model ignores the periodic and trend terms of the time series during its prediction and cannot identify the superposition effects of many different laws the prediction results can be degraded the decomposition method could be utilized to divide time series data into subsequences with different frequency components the model prediction was then performed to obtain better results ausati and amanollahi 2016 chou and wang 2004 ye et al 2022 sequence decomposition methods mainly include wavelet decomposition zhang 1997 empirical mode decomposition emd huang et al 1998 variational modal decomposition vmd dragomiretskiy and zosso 2014 and their improved methods wu and huang 2009 scholars established a hybrid prediction model by combining the decomposition method with machine learning and applied it to soil moisture prediction prasad et al 2018 2019 runoff prediction chen et al 2021 feng et al 2020 and air quality prediction li et al 2022 sun and xu 2021 however this hybrid prediction model has not been applied to et0 prediction as the main grain producing area in china xinjiang is located in an arid and semi arid region with an extreme lack of water resources both the security supply of food and the shortage of water resources urgently need an accurate prediction method of crop water demand to optimize farm irrigation management water saving and promote efficient use of water resources although current weather forecasts included several meteorological elements for a short term forecast these meteorological elements could not satisfy the needs of the fao 56 pm formula to accurately calculate et0 therefore this paper proposed three time series prediction models with the only knowing of the et0 data before the prediction period and without the knowing of other data in the prediction period to accurately predict short term daily et0 these models combined the nonlinear approximation ability of bpnn model with the ability of decomposition methods emd eemd and vmd to process nonlinear et0 data namely emd bpnn eemd bpnn and vmd bpnn and then the water demand of different crops accurately calculated by the crop coefficient method in the prediction period in summary the primary objectives of this paper are 1 evaluating the performance of three hybrid models and comparing their ability to predict et0 with three single machine learning models 2 analyzing the performance of the hybrid model in predicting the daily et0 of different prediction periods 1 3 5 7d 3 finding an appropriate model for et0 prediction in xinjiang 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is the xinjiang uygur autonomous region fig 1 located in the northwest inland of china and the hinterland of the eurasian continent the alternate distribution of mountains and basins characterizes the landform the unique geographical location and terrain conditions lead to unique climatic conditions in xinjiang the meteorological stations and the climatic information are shown in table 1 the climate in the study area has four distinct seasons cold winter and hot summer the daily average temperature in winter is 4 4 the daily average temperature in summer is 13 24 the sunshine is sufficient with an average duration of 8 h per day it is one of the regions extremely sensitive to global climate change in china the precipitation is mainly the atlantic water vapor brought by the westerly belt the rainfall is significant in mountainous areas and few in the basin s center xinjiang is an arid region with an extreme lack of water resources the annual precipitations in southern and northern xinjiang are 20 100 mm and 100 500 mm respectively the contradiction between water transmission and distribution is becoming increasingly prominent as a national strategic reserve area for food production xinjiang has become a hot area for agricultural water resources research 2 2 data collection the meteorological data are acquired from the china meteorological administration http data cma cn which does not provide specific measuring instruments however the data are measured according to the chinese national standard qiu et al 2022 and the measured data are internationally recognized deng et al 2019 feng et al 2021 yang et al 2017 all the data are strictly reviewed and have good quality the model is established using the daily meteorological data of 11 weather stations from 1993 to 2016 the data from 1993 to 2010 and 2011 2016 are chosen as the training and prediction sets respectively meteorological data include maximum

monteith fao 56 pm equation allen et al 1998 recommended by the fao in 1998 as the universal standard for et0 calculation research scholars calculated the et0 from available daily meteorological data by using the fao 56 pm equation chu et al 2019 gao et al 2021 jerin et al 2021 li et al 2018 salam et al 2020 the fao 56 pm equation is described by eq 1 1 e t 0 0 408 r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ

2 4 short term daily et0 forecasts using hybrid prediction model fig 2 shows the outline of this study this study establishes the bpnn gradient boosting regression tree gbrt support vector regression svr bpnn based on empirical mode decomposition emd bpnn bpnn based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd bpnn and bpnn based on variational mode decomposition vmd bpnn models to predict et0 empirical mode decomposition emd ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd and variational mode decomposition vmd are utilized to decompose the original et0 data into several subsequences to solve the non stationary problem of the original data provide information about the original data s structure and periodicity and improve the prediction model s performance in this paper the short term forecasting duration of the et0 is taken as seven days fig 3 shows the flow chart of the hybrid model based on modal decomposition bpnn the construction of the decomposition bpnn model included the following three stages 1 decomposing the et0 daily time series into a group of several intrinsic mode functions imfs with the modal decomposition algorithm 2 forecasting each imf series using the bpnn model 3 summing each imf sequence predicted by the bpnn model to obtain the final prediction results 2 5 modal decomposition algorithms 2 5 1 variational modal decomposition dragomiretskiy and zosso 2014 proposed a variational mode decomposition vmd method for signal decomposition which searches for the optimal solution of the variational model iteratively the intrinsic mode function u k t is defined as a frequency or amplitude modulation of the harmonic signal defined as 2 u k t a k t cos φ k t k 1 2 k where a k t is the instantaneous amplitude of u k t φ k t is the instantaneous phase t denotes the time script the primary iterative solution process of the vmd can be summarized as follows step 1 the original daily reference crop evapotranspiration series is decomposed into n 1 imf subsequences as the original input the spectrum of each modal component is adjusted from the central band to the baseband using mixed movement with the exponential function tuned to the central frequency in order to minimize the sum of the estimated bandwidth of each modal component function the square l2 norm of the demodulated signal gradient is calculated step 2 the daily et0 series f is decomposed into k natural modal functions u k t with limited bandwidth and the following minimization problem is solved to establish the corresponding constrained variational model 3 m i n u k ω k k t δ t j π t u k t e j ω k t 2 2 s t k u k t f where u k u 1 u k is the set of decomposed modal functions ω k ω 1 ω k is the set of central frequencies of u k δ t is the dirac function is the convolution operator step 3 the quadratic penalty term α and the lagrange multipliers λ t are introduced to transform the constrained variational optimization problem into an unconstrained one the augmented lagrangian function can be expressed as 4 l u k ω k λ α k t δ t j π t u k t e j ω k t 2 2 f t k u k t 2 2 λ t f t k u k t step 4 the alternating direction method of multipliers admm iterative algorithm is employed to update each natural mode function and its central frequency to determine the saddle point of the above lagrange equation and the optimal solution of the above function the expression of u k n 1 is as follows 5 u k n 1 argmin u k x α k t δ t j π t u k t e j ω k t 2 2 f t i u i t i u i t λ t 2 2 2 step 5 based on the plancherel fourier transform the following update rules for u k ω k and λ can be obtained 6 u k n 1 ω f ω i k u i n 1 ω λ ω 2 1 2 α ω ω k 2 7 ω k n 1 0 ω u k ω 2 d ω 0 u k ω 2 d ω 8 λ n 1 ω λ n ω τ f ω k u k n 1 ω where ω is the frequency f ω u k n 1 ω u i n 1 ω and λ n 1 ω denote fourier transforms of f t u k n 1 t u i n 1 t and λ n 1 t τ is the time step n represents the number of iterations 2 5 2 empirical mode decomposition since the variation law of the et0 series of the original day is nonlinear empirical mode decomposition emd decomposes the et0 data of the original day into a series of imf components with different characteristic scales according to their fluctuations accordingly the characteristic analysis of the et0 data of the original day can be transformed into each imf component analysis huang et al 1998 among them the imf component should meet the following conditions 1 the number of extreme points in the decomposition process should be equal to the number of zero crossings or at most 1 2 the mean value of local maximum and minimum at any time is 0 fig 4 shows the main process of emd for the original series x t for a given input daily et0 original daily et0 series x t can be expressed as 9 x t k 1 k q k t u k t 2 5 3 ensemble empirical mode decomposition wu and huang 2009 presented an ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd algorithm to deal with the possible mode aliasing in the emd process the algorithm introduces the white noise sequence into the original signal and employs the characteristics of uniform distribution of the white noise spectrum to reduce the modal aliasing of imf components significantly in order to compensate for the influence of zero mean white noise on decomposition results this process is repeated many times and the mean value of the emd decomposition results is taken the calculation process of eemd is given below step 1 parameter initialization set the emd decomposition times to m and the standard deviation of the introduced white noise to α generally 0 1 0 4 times the standard deviation of the original signal x t step 2 a random gaussian white noise sequence with zero mean and standard deviation of α is added to the original et0 time series x t to obtain a new sequence x t according to the above emd algorithm the imf component q i k t and residual component u i t can be obtained where q i k t is the k th imf component decomposed after introducing the i th white noise step 3 in order to eliminate the influence of white noise the following integrated average operation is performed on the decomposition results of m times of emd and the final eemd decomposition results are as follows 10 q k t 1 m m 1 m q i k t the parameter setting in the eemd decomposition process significantly influences the results if the standard deviation of white noise is too small it is challenging to improve the emd decomposition results otherwise the actual signal extracted during decomposition will become less resulting in some false harmonic components 2 6 machine learning model 2 6 1 backpropagation neural network a backpropagation neural network bpnn is a multilayer feedforward neural network with error backpropagation proposed by rumelhart et al 1988 the bpnn algorithm includes the input hidden and output layers the input signal is transmitted layer by layer from the input layer to each hidden layer and finally to the output layer as shown in the flow chart in fig 5 the input i j and output o j of the j th neuron are calculated by the following formula 11 i j i w i j o i 12 o j f i j θ j where w i j is the connection weight between neurons in the input hidden and output layers f i j θ j is the neuron excitation function θ j is the neuron s bias input in order to perform the network training and weight updating the neural network employs the gradient descent algorithm to modify the weights and minimize the error between the actual output values and the expected ones such that the simulated output of the neural network approaches the expected output the weights and biases are updated using the following formula 13 w j i k 1 w i j k η δ j o i 14 θ i k 1 θ i k η δ j where k is the epoch number δ j is the backpropagation errors of the hidden layer η is the learning rate 2 6 2 gradient boosting regression tree the gradient boosting regression tree gbrt algorithm is an iterative decision tree algorithm proposed by friedman 2002 this algorithm constructs multiple weak learners with low prediction accuracy iteratively combines them into a strong learner with high prediction accuracy and trains the regression tree based on the residual obtained by each weak learner to reduce the deviation of the overall classification model the results of all regression trees are accumulated to obtain the final prediction result in each stage of the gradient marching algorithm 1 m m the function can be expressed as 15 f m x f m 1 x h m x where h m x is the basic function and f m x is the sum of m weak learners for each boosting iteration the gradient boosting algorithm improves the model f m 1 by adding a new regression tree h m to obtain f m accordingly the target value y can be obtained zhang and jung 2021 fig 6 illustrates the general principle of the proposed gbrt model 2 6 3 support vector regression support vector regression svr is a powerful nonlinear regression model acquired from a support vector machine svm vapnik 1995 it transforms the known space into a high dimensional one using a nonlinear mapping method it performs linear regression in the high dimensional space to obtain the original space s nonlinear regression characteristics let the training sample be d x i y i i 1 2 3 n where xi rn and yi r are the corresponding input and output values respectively and n is the total number of training samples svr can be obtained through xi yi training the mapping function can be expressed as 16 f x w φ x b where w and b are function coefficients and φ x represents nonlinear transformations from sample points to high dimensional space svr makes the error between the output value obtained through f x and the target value within the allowable error range accordingly the following cost function should be minimized 17 min w b 1 2 w 2 c m 1 m ℓ ε f x i y i where c is the regularization constant and w 2 is a regularization term representing the euclidean norm the insensitive loss function ℓ ε is related to ε as 18 ℓ ε 0 z ε z ε o t h e r w i s e the svr regression equation can be obtained by solving 18 using the lagrange multiplier method 2 7 statistical analysis four error analysis standards including root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae determination coefficient r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and mean deviation md are utilized to evaluate the accuracy and stability of the prediction model wang et al 2020 wu et al 2022 zhao et al 2022 the specific formulas are 19 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i x i 2 20 m a e 1 n i 1 n y i x i 21 r 2 i 1 n x i x y i y 2 i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 22 n s e 1 i 1 n y i x i 2 i 1 n x i x 2 23 m d 1 n y i x i where n is the number of samples and x i and y i are the ith measured and predicted values respectively x and y are the average measured and predicted values the best fitting of the precited values with the corresponding measured ones can be attained when rmse 0 mae 0 md 0 nse 1 and r2 1 3 model application 3 1 decomposing reference crop evapotranspiration time series using vmd eemd and emd methods the reference crop evapotranspiration et0 time series is decomposed using vmd eemd and emd techniques the decomposition results in figs 7 9 indicate that the vmd decomposition method decomposes the original et0 time series of the urumqi station into seven independent imf components from the lowest to the highest frequencies the eemd decomposition method decomposes the time series into 12 independent imf components and a residual component in contrast the emd decomposition method decomposes the time series into ten independent imf components and a residual component the imf1 component in fig 7 the imf7 component in fig 8 and the imf6 component in fig 9 indicate apparent annual periodic variabilities in the et0 time series compared with eemd and emd decomposition methods vmd decomposition methods show more apparent periodic changes and effectively reduce mode mixing the eemd and emd methods residual components show an upward trend in the et0 time series after decomposition the nonlinear and non stationary time series can be converted into stationary time series which can help to improve the prediction ability of subsequent machine learning models 3 2 modeling approach when using the bpnn model to predict time series based on historical observation data of time series a key problem is how to select the input variables of the model correctly the formula for selecting input parameters can be expressed as 24 y t l e a d b p x t 1 x t 2 x t δ where y is the predicted et0 t is the current time δ is the embedding dimension l e a d is the prediction step size when lead 1 the et0 time series is predicted in one step that is the current day value is predicted with the data of δ days before the date to be measured therefore several input combinations are tried using the bpnn to forecast the et0 studied in this paper fig 10 shows the selection of input parameters therefore δ 9 is selected as the input parameter of the bpnn model this research refers to the et0 data for 24 years 1993 2016 the dataset is divided into training subset and testing subset with a ratio of 75 25 to design et0 forecasting machine learning models as cross validation evaluation methods such as hold out and k fold may lead to the issue of data leakage or modeling from hindsight i e the past data are used for evaluating the model whereas the future data are used for training the model lv et al 2022 the time series data is defined in chronological order sequence in order to keep the structure of the sequence complete the order sequence must be retained here the bpnn model with strong universality are employed and three robust decomposition methods are applied to improve the stability of time series data to prevent variables with large numerical ranges dominating variables with small numerical range in the models and accelerate the models training process and convergence the normalization and denormalization processes of training and prediction sets are adopted the bpnn prediction model is constructed based on setting and optimizing the parameters this paper establishes the bpnn model using matlab software table 2 shows the training parameters of the bpnn model this paper determines the number of hidden layer nodes to obtain satisfactory prediction results since there is no standard rule to determine the hidden layer calisir et al 2023 one of the challenges in developing the bpnn models is to optimize the number of neurons in the hidden layer the number of hidden layer nodes can be determined by manual search methods trial and error strategy barzegar et al 2019 wang et al 2015 since the input parameter is determined as 9 the number of output layer nodes is 1 the number of hidden layer nodes is changed between 4 and 13 and their corresponding errors are compared finally the model with the minimum error is selected table 3 describes the hidden layer selection of the vmd bpnn model in 11 stations 4 results and analysis 4 1 accuracy analysis of et0 daily value predicted by the backpropagation neural network model with different decomposition methods table 4 shows the accuracy indices of emd bpnn eemd bpnn and vmd bpnn at urumqi station as shown in table 4 rmse 0 75 mae 0 5 r2 0 92 and nse 0 92 for the three models at urumqi station demonstrating high reliability comparing the three hybrid models the vmd bpnn hybrid model provides rmse 0 405 mm d mae 0 268 mm d r2 0 979 and nse 0 977 accordingly its prediction accuracy and stability are superior to emd bpnn and eemd bpnn models fig 11 compares the target and predicted values of eemd bpnn vmd bpnn and emd bpnn models in the urumqi station in the prediction set as shown in fig 11 the difference between the least square regression lsr line of the vmd bpnn mixed model and the standard value and 45 line was the smallest reflecting high accuracy the difference between the emd bpnn model and the lsr line of the standard value and 45 line was significant and the prediction accuracy was relatively low the predicted value of the eemd bpnn model was higher than the standard value in case of high evapotranspiration the predicted value of the emd bpnn model was lower than the standard value there are many discrete points between the eemd bpnn and emd bpnn models the prediction accuracy of the vmd bpnn model in the overall interval of evapotranspiration was higher than that of the other two models because the imf component obtained by vmd decomposition was smoother than that obtained by eemd and emd decomposition niu et al 2018 and modal aliasing was avoided vmd better expressed the change law of et0 than eemd and emd 4 2 prediction accuracy analysis of the vmd bpnn model at different stations table 5 compares the evaluation parameters of the 1 day prediction et0 results of the vmd bpnn model at different stations to evaluate the general applicability of the model in xinjiang as presented in table 5 the prediction accuracy of the vmd bpnn model at all stations in xinjiang was high with rmse less than 0 6 mm d mae less than 0 4 mm d r2 greater than 0 89 and nse greater than 0 91 among them the r2 and nse of 80 of stations were about 0 98 and the simulation accuracy and stability were generally good among them aksu station had the best prediction accuracy with rmse 0 346 mm d mae 0 234 mm d r2 0 994 and nse 0 998 generally the vmd bpnn model could adapt to the simulation calculation of et0 in xinjiang 4 3 the analysis of the prediction accuracy of et0 within seven days by the vmd bpnn model in order to evaluate the vmd bpnn model s prediction accuracy on days 1 3 5 and 7 table 5 compares the predicted parameters of the vmd bpnn model when the prediction period is days 1 3 5 and 7 as shown in table 6 as the prediction period increased rmse of the vmd bpnn model increased from 0 405 to 0 588 mae increased from 0 268 to 0 382 r2 decreased from 0 979 to 0 954 nse decreased from 0 977 to 0 952 and the prediction accuracy and stability decreased for a seven day prediction period the nse and r2 of the model were greater than 0 95 with mae 0 382 and rmse 0 588 indicating the high accuracy and stability of the vmd bpnn model in short term prediction in order to more accurately evaluate the model s accuracy three categories can be formed according to the et0 value low evapotranspiration medium evapotranspiration and high evapotranspiration correspond to the et0 values lower than 1 mm between 1 mm and 5 mm and greater than 5 mm respectively fig 12 shows the comparison of mean deviation md between the vmd bpnn model and the standard value of the low medium and high evapotranspiration on the 1 day 3 day 5 day and 7 day forecasting periods as depicted in fig 12 the absolute value of md of low evapotranspiration was less than 0 1 the absolute value of md of medium evapotranspiration increased from 0 15 on day 1 0 26 on day 7 while increasing the prediction period the absolute value of md of high evapotranspiration increased from 0 22 on day 1 0 37 on day 7 while increasing the prediction period the minimum absolute value of md of the model simulation is obtained for low evapotranspiration followed by medium and high evapotranspiration the predicted results were higher and lower than the standard value on average while predicting low and high evapotranspiration respectively 4 4 comparison of the simulation accuracy of the vmd bpnn model with other single machine learning models table 7 compares the simulation accuracy of the vmd bpnn model with three single machine learning models bpnn svr and gbrt table 7 shows that the vmd bpnn hybrid model can provide rmse 0 405 mm d mae 0 268 mm d r2 0 979 and nse 0 977 the rmse and mae values of the vmd bpnn model were more than 60 smaller than those of bpnn svr and gbrt at the same time r2 and nse were more than 15 higher than those of the three models the model s prediction accuracy improved significantly after combining the vmd decomposition method with the bpnn model besides the r2 and nse values were higher than 0 95 this indicated the relatively poor robustness of the bpnn model and its weak prediction ability if the previous data were not processed by technology the vmd model reduces the non stationarity behavior of the original data and the interference components in the original data the bpnn model predicted the decomposed imf components due to its strong nonlinear mapping ability the prediction accuracy of the vmd bpnn model was significantly improved compared with that of a vmd model accordingly it could predict et0 more accurately fig 13 compares the simulation error of the vmd bpnn model with the bpnn svr and gbrt models the four model errors were calculated by subtracting the predicted values from the actual ones as shown in fig 13 the vmd bpnn model provided the minimum error most of which were between 0 5 0 5 mm d the other three empirical models provided significant errors and many outliers indicating the low prediction stability of a single machine learning model 5 discussion this study indicated the good accuracy and stability of the vmd bpnn hybrid prediction model in predicting the daily scale reference crop evapotranspiration et0 time series compared with the time domain adaptive decomposition methods eemd and emd the vmd method has a clearer theoretical basis higher decomposition accuracy and effectively reduces mode aliasing guo et al 2022 besides the vmd method requires less prior knowledge of input signals and show more apparent periodic changes the vmd bpnn model makes a short term prediction on subsequences while improving the bpnn s prediction accuracy under the input with a short time delay moreover the time series can be decomposed by modal decomposition which can effectively reduce the nonstationary data of the reference crop evapotranspiration time series optimize the bpnn structure reduce the computational complexity and effectively improve the bpnn s prediction performance the vmd bpnn model provides a good prediction effect and can predict nonlinear and non stationary reference crop evapotranspiration time series the vmd bpnn model provides a high accuracy for predicting the daily scale time series when the forecasting period is 3 days and 7 days the model s performance degrades slightly this also prompted subsequent model improvement and weekly and monthly et0 prediction model research malik et al 2022 suggested that the deep learning based model could predict reference crop evapotranspiration in india with different climates in advance by multiple steps t 3 t 7 in the 7 day et0 prediction the performance of the hybrid machine learning model degrades slightly the performance indicators demonstrated that the accuracy of the vmd bpnn model results in a 7 days prediction period was slightly lower than that in the one day prediction period which agreed with the research results of malik et al 2022 this demonstrates the feasibility of the vmd bpnn model in predicting the daily reference crop evapotranspiration time series in the study area in terms of model portability analysis to evaluate the adaptability of the vmd bpnn model in xinjiang the et0 calculated by the fao 56 pm formula from 1993 to 2010 at urumqi station is utilized as the training set and the et0 from 2011 to 2016 at ten stations including altay tacheng yining yanqi turpan aksu kashgar ruoqiang hotan and hami is taken as the prediction set for simulation the relevant parameters are calculated according to the model evaluation method and the prediction results are compared with the standard values fig 14 shows a scatter plot of the standard value and the predicted output of the vmd bpnn model the portability analysis results indicate that under the cross combination of training and prediction stations the vmd bpnn model provides the highest prediction accuracy nse and r2 0 95 and the simulation accuracy in some regions is even higher than in the original region therefore the vmd bpnn model can predict the short term et0 between the xinjiang stations with strong applicability fig 15 is a violin chart comparing the standard values of the bpnn and vmd bpnn model prediction results fig 15 shows that the distribution of the overall prediction results of the vmd bpnn model is compatible with the distribution of the standard values while the distribution of the overall prediction results of the bpnn model is quite different from the standard values when the et0 is high the prediction results of the vmd bpnn model are generally small with specific limitations and the model s reliability will be reduced the proposed vmd bpnn model only simulates the reference crop evapotranspiration in xinjiang china in the follow up study more reference crop evapotranspiration forecasts in different climatic regions will be performed to make better decisions for the agricultural irrigation system 6 conclusion a combination of the vmd and bpnn methods vmd bpnn was employed to predict et0 in xinjiang the results demonstrated that the vmd bpnn prediction model could accurately predict et0 in xinjiang and provide high accuracy and stability the following conclusions can be drawn from simulations 1 a comparison of emd bpnn eemd bpnn and vmd bpnn with bpnn svr and gbrt indicated that the et0 prediction s accuracy of the hybrid prediction model was significantly higher than that of a single machine learning model the prediction accuracy of the vmd bpnn model was higher than that of the emd bpnn and eemd bpnn models especially in the high evapotranspiration prediction emd bpnn and eemd bpnn models reflected an apparent unorganized point set and the performance of the vmd bpnn model was superior therefore the vmd bpnn model could be employed for et0

9070,this paper established hybrid prediction models based on variational mode decomposition vmd empirical mode decomposition emd and ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd combined with the backpropagation neural network model bpnn to improve the prediction accuracy of reference crop evapotranspiration et0 time series with the characteristics of nonlinearity and instability the daily et0 data of 11 representative stations in xinjiang from 1993 to 2016 were selected for model training and testing and compared with the results of support vector regression svr and gradient boosting regression tree gbrt as the two empirical machine learning models the results indicated the superiority of the vmd bpnn hybrid prediction model to emd bpnn and eemd bpnn in terms of accuracy and stability with root mean square error rmse 0 405 mm d mean absolute error mae 0 268 mm d and coefficient of determination r2 0 979 when employing the vmd bpnn model to forecast et0 for seven days the rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse of the vmd bpnn model were 0 588 mm d and 0 952 respectively and the prediction results indicated high precision and reliability the prediction accuracy of the vmd bpnn model was significantly higher than that of single machine learning models such as bpnn svr and gbrt the rmse and mae values of the vmd bpnn model were more than 60 smaller than bpnn svr and gbrt models and r2 and nse were approximately 18 higher than bpnn svr and gbrt models respectively this demonstrates the effectiveness of the vmd method in reducing the non stationarity of the original daily et0 data the bpnn model predicted the decomposed data series and the prediction accuracy and stability were significantly enhanced this indicates the high reliability of the vmd bpnn model and its capability for et0 prediction in xinjiang keywords reference crop evapotranspiration prediction model decomposition algorithm neural network xinjiang region data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction urbanization development and the rapid growth of the population have accelerated the competition with agriculture water resources especially in arid and semi arid regions martí et al 2015 the efficient utilization of agricultural water resources is crucial for alleviating the water crisis as a significant factor in the hydrological cycle evapotranspiration et plays an essential role in irrigation management and design feng et al 2017b qiu et al 2019 the et could be obtained by the crop coefficient method with the product of the crop coefficient kc and the reference crop evapotranspiration et0 fan et al 2018 wang et al 2020 which was proposed by the food and agriculture organization fao to estimate crop evapotranspiration under standard condition etc allen et al 1998 therefore if the et0 is accurately predicted the et for different corps would be calculated in the future which is benefit for optimizing agricultural water resource allocation in advance formulating more accurate irrigation systems and improving the water resources utilization efficiency with the continuous development of computer technology many scholars have predicted and estimated et0 using artificial intelligence algorithms e g machine learning model salam and islam 2020 zhang et al 2020 elbeltagi et al 2022 the machine learning model can provide a more straightforward solution for nonlinear multivariable problems wu et al 2019 the numerical simulation method has the advantages of short time high precision and strong generalization ability elbeltagi et al 2021 feng et al 2016 mousavi et al 2015 kumar et al 2002 first introduced an artificial neural network to calculate et0 landeras et al 2008a utilized an artificial neural network ann in processing nonlinear data to simulate the reference crop evapotranspiration and found its excellent performance in simulating and calculating et0 tabari et al 2012 employed the support vector machine svm adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis multiple linear regression mlr and multiple nonlinear regression mnlr to establish an et0 simulation model which outperformed the blaney criddle and hargreaves and jensen haise models petković et al 2016 employed a radial basis function network with particle swarm optimization rbfn pso and a radial basis function network with backpropagation rbfn bp to estimate the et0 of serbia they demonstrated the superiority of the above methods to ann and svm in terms of statistical characteristics feng et al 2017a employed random forest rf and generalized regression neural network grnn models to estimate the daily et0 in southwest china although both models could well predict daily et0 the prediction effect of the rf model was slightly superior to that of the grnn model zhang et al 2020 established an algorithm for gradient boosting on decision trees catboost to accurately predict and simulate the daily et0 and the calculation accuracy was higher than that of grnn and rf models adnan et al 2021 established a novel hybrid adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis wcamfo in a tropical humid area with limited data to predict the monthly et0 with high accuracy and low error it is worth noting that backpropagation neural network bpnn may have shortcomings such as overfitting and falling into a local minimum wu et al 2020 especially in et0 simulation prediction the accuracy of prediction results was slightly low due to the high heterogeneity of evaporation data since a single ann prediction model ignores the periodic and trend terms of the time series during its prediction and cannot identify the superposition effects of many different laws the prediction results can be degraded the decomposition method could be utilized to divide time series data into subsequences with different frequency components the model prediction was then performed to obtain better results ausati and amanollahi 2016 chou and wang 2004 ye et al 2022 sequence decomposition methods mainly include wavelet decomposition zhang 1997 empirical mode decomposition emd huang et al 1998 variational modal decomposition vmd dragomiretskiy and zosso 2014 and their improved methods wu and huang 2009 scholars established a hybrid prediction model by combining the decomposition method with machine learning and applied it to soil moisture prediction prasad et al 2018 2019 runoff prediction chen et al 2021 feng et al 2020 and air quality prediction li et al 2022 sun and xu 2021 however this hybrid prediction model has not been applied to et0 prediction as the main grain producing area in china xinjiang is located in an arid and semi arid region with an extreme lack of water resources both the security supply of food and the shortage of water resources urgently need an accurate prediction method of crop water demand to optimize farm irrigation management water saving and promote efficient use of water resources although current weather forecasts included several meteorological elements for a short term forecast these meteorological elements could not satisfy the needs of the fao 56 pm formula to accurately calculate et0 therefore this paper proposed three time series prediction models with the only knowing of the et0 data before the prediction period and without the knowing of other data in the prediction period to accurately predict short term daily et0 these models combined the nonlinear approximation ability of bpnn model with the ability of decomposition methods emd eemd and vmd to process nonlinear et0 data namely emd bpnn eemd bpnn and vmd bpnn and then the water demand of different crops accurately calculated by the crop coefficient method in the prediction period in summary the primary objectives of this paper are 1 evaluating the performance of three hybrid models and comparing their ability to predict et0 with three single machine learning models 2 analyzing the performance of the hybrid model in predicting the daily et0 of different prediction periods 1 3 5 7d 3 finding an appropriate model for et0 prediction in xinjiang 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is the xinjiang uygur autonomous region fig 1 located in the northwest inland of china and the hinterland of the eurasian continent the alternate distribution of mountains and basins characterizes the landform the unique geographical location and terrain conditions lead to unique climatic conditions in xinjiang the meteorological stations and the climatic information are shown in table 1 the climate in the study area has four distinct seasons cold winter and hot summer the daily average temperature in winter is 4 4 the daily average temperature in summer is 13 24 the sunshine is sufficient with an average duration of 8 h per day it is one of the regions extremely sensitive to global climate change in china the precipitation is mainly the atlantic water vapor brought by the westerly belt the rainfall is significant in mountainous areas and few in the basin s center xinjiang is an arid region with an extreme lack of water resources the annual precipitations in southern and northern xinjiang are 20 100 mm and 100 500 mm respectively the contradiction between water transmission and distribution is becoming increasingly prominent as a national strategic reserve area for food production xinjiang has become a hot area for agricultural water resources research 2 2 data collection the meteorological data are acquired from the china meteorological administration http data cma cn which does not provide specific measuring instruments however the data are measured according to the chinese national standard qiu et al 2022 and the measured data are internationally recognized deng et al 2019 feng et al 2021 yang et al 2017 all the data are strictly reviewed and have good quality the model is established using the daily meteorological data of 11 weather stations from 1993 to 2016 the data from 1993 to 2010 and 2011 2016 are chosen as the training and prediction sets respectively meteorological data include maximum

svr bpnn based on empirical mode decomposition emd bpnn bpnn based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd bpnn and bpnn based on variational mode decomposition vmd bpnn models to predict et0 empirical mode decomposition emd ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd and variational mode decomposition vmd are utilized to decompose the original et0 data into several subsequences to solve the non stationary problem of the original data provide information about the original data s structure and periodicity and improve the prediction model s performance in this paper the short term forecasting duration of the et0 is taken as seven days fig 3 shows the flow chart of the hybrid model based on modal decomposition bpnn the construction of the decomposition bpnn model included the following three stages 1 decomposing the et0 daily time series into a group of several intrinsic mode functions imfs with the modal decomposition algorithm 2 forecasting each imf series using the bpnn model 3 summing each imf sequence predicted by the bpnn model to obtain the final prediction results 2 5 modal decomposition algorithms 2 5 1 variational modal decomposition dragomiretskiy and zosso 2014 proposed a variational mode decomposition vmd method for signal decomposition which searches for the optimal solution of the variational model iteratively the intrinsic mode function u k t is defined as a frequency or amplitude modulation of the harmonic signal defined as 2 u k t a k t cos φ k t k 1 2 k where a k t is the instantaneous amplitude of u k t φ k t is the instantaneous phase t denotes the time script the primary iterative solution process of the vmd can be summarized as follows step 1 the original daily reference crop evapotranspiration series is decomposed into n 1 imf subsequences as the original input the spectrum of each modal component is adjusted from the central band to the baseband using mixed movement with the exponential function tuned to the central frequency in order to minimize the sum of the estimated bandwidth of each modal component function the square l2 norm of the demodulated signal gradient is calculated step 2 the daily et0 series f is decomposed into k natural modal functions u k t with limited bandwidth and the following minimization problem is solved to establish the corresponding constrained variational model 3 m i n u k ω k k t δ t j π t u k t e j ω k t 2 2 s t k u k t f where u k u 1 u k is the set of decomposed modal functions ω k ω 1 ω k is the set of central frequencies of u k δ t is the dirac function is the convolution operator step 3 the quadratic penalty term α and the lagrange multipliers λ t are introduced to transform the constrained variational optimization problem into an unconstrained one the augmented lagrangian function can be expressed as 4 l u k ω k λ α k t δ t j π t u k t e j ω k t 2 2 f t k u k t 2 2 λ t f t k u k t step 4 the alternating direction method of multipliers admm iterative algorithm is employed to update each natural mode function and its central frequency to determine the saddle point of the above lagrange equation and the optimal solution of the above function the expression of u k n 1 is as follows 5 u k n 1 argmin u k x α k t δ t j π t u k t e j ω k t 2 2 f t i u i t i u i t λ t 2 2 2 step 5 based on the plancherel fourier transform the following update rules for u k ω k and λ can be obtained 6 u k n 1 ω f ω i k u i n 1 ω λ ω 2 1 2 α ω ω k 2 7 ω k n 1 0 ω u k ω 2 d ω 0 u k ω 2 d ω 8 λ n 1 ω λ n ω τ f ω k u k n 1 ω where ω is the frequency f ω u k n 1 ω u i n 1 ω and λ n 1 ω denote fourier transforms of f t u k n 1 t u i n 1 t and λ n 1 t τ is the time step n represents the number of iterations 2 5 2 empirical mode decomposition since the variation law of the et0 series of the original day is nonlinear empirical mode decomposition emd decomposes the et0 data of the original day into a series of imf components with different characteristic scales according to their fluctuations accordingly the characteristic analysis of the et0 data of the original day can be transformed into each imf component analysis huang et al 1998 among them the imf component should meet the following conditions 1 the number of extreme points in the decomposition process should be equal to the number of zero crossings or at most 1 2 the mean value of local maximum and minimum at any time is 0 fig 4 shows the main process of emd for the original series x t for a given input daily et0 original daily et0 series x t can be expressed as 9 x t k 1 k q k t u k t 2 5 3 ensemble empirical mode decomposition wu and huang 2009 presented an ensemble empirical mode decomposition eemd algorithm to deal with the possible mode aliasing in the emd process the algorithm introduces the white noise sequence into the original signal and employs the characteristics of uniform distribution of the white noise spectrum to reduce the modal aliasing of imf components significantly in order to compensate for the influence of zero mean white noise on decomposition results this process is repeated many times and the mean value of the emd decomposition results is taken the calculation process of eemd is given below step 1 parameter initialization set the emd decomposition times to m and the standard deviation of the introduced white noise to α generally 0 1 0 4 times the standard deviation of the original signal x t step 2 a random gaussian white noise sequence with zero mean and standard deviation of α is added to the original et0 time series x t to obtain a new sequence x t according to the above emd algorithm the imf component q i k t and residual component u i t can be obtained where q i k t is the k th imf component decomposed after introducing the i th white noise step 3 in order to eliminate the influence of white noise the following integrated average operation is performed on the decomposition results of m times of emd and the final eemd decomposition results are as follows 10 q k t 1 m m 1 m q i k t the parameter setting in the eemd decomposition process significantly influences the results if the standard deviation of white noise is too small it is challenging to improve the emd decomposition results otherwise the actual signal extracted during decomposition will become less resulting in some false harmonic components 2 6 machine learning model 2 6 1 backpropagation neural network a backpropagation neural network bpnn is a multilayer feedforward neural network with error backpropagation proposed by rumelhart et al 1988 the bpnn algorithm includes the input hidden and output layers the input signal is transmitted layer by layer from the input layer to each hidden layer and finally to the output layer as shown in the flow chart in fig 5 the input i j and output o j of the j th neuron are calculated by the following formula 11 i j i w i j o i 12 o j f i j θ j where w i j is the connection weight between neurons in the input hidden and output layers f i j θ j is the neuron excitation function θ j is the neuron s bias input in order to perform the network training and weight updating the neural network employs the gradient descent algorithm to modify the weights and minimize the error between the actual output values and the expected ones such that the simulated output of the neural network approaches the expected output the weights and biases are updated using the following formula 13 w j i k 1 w i j k η δ j o i 14 θ i k 1 θ i k η δ j where k is the epoch number δ j is the backpropagation errors of the hidden layer η is the learning rate 2 6 2 gradient boosting regression tree the gradient boosting regression tree gbrt algorithm is an iterative decision tree algorithm proposed by friedman 2002 this algorithm constructs multiple weak learners with low prediction accuracy iteratively combines them into a strong learner with high prediction accuracy and trains the regression tree based on the residual obtained by each weak learner to reduce the deviation of the overall classification model the results of all regression trees are accumulated to obtain the final prediction result in each stage of the gradient marching algorithm 1 m m the function can be expressed as 15 f m x f m 1 x h m x where h m x is the basic function and f m x is the sum of m weak learners for each boosting iteration the gradient boosting algorithm improves the model f m 1 by adding a new regression tree h m to obtain f m accordingly the target value y can be obtained zhang and jung 2021 fig 6 illustrates the general principle of the proposed gbrt model 2 6 3 support vector regression support vector regression svr is a powerful nonlinear regression model acquired from a support vector machine svm vapnik 1995 it transforms the known space into a high dimensional one using a nonlinear mapping method it performs linear regression in the high dimensional space to obtain the original space s nonlinear regression characteristics let the training sample be d x i y i i 1 2 3 n where xi rn and yi r are the corresponding input and output values respectively and n is the total number of training samples svr can be obtained through xi yi training the mapping function can be expressed as 16 f x w φ x b where w and b are function coefficients and φ x represents nonlinear transformations from sample points to high dimensional space svr makes the error between the output value obtained through f x and the target value within the allowable error range accordingly the following cost function should be minimized 17 min w b 1 2 w 2 c m 1 m ℓ ε f x i y i where c is the regularization constant and w 2 is a regularization term representing the euclidean norm the insensitive loss function ℓ ε is related to ε as 18 ℓ ε 0 z ε z ε o t h e r w i s e the svr regression equation can be obtained by solving 18 using the lagrange multiplier method 2 7 statistical analysis four error analysis standards including root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae determination coefficient r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and mean deviation md are utilized to evaluate the accuracy and stability of the prediction model wang et al 2020 wu et al 2022 zhao et al 2022 the specific formulas are 19 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i x i 2 20 m a e

measured and predicted values respectively x and y are the average measured and predicted values the best fitting of the precited values with the corresponding measured ones can be attained when rmse 0 mae 0 md 0 nse 1 and r2 1 3 model application 3 1 decomposing reference crop evapotranspiration time series using vmd eemd and emd methods the reference crop evapotranspiration et0 time series is decomposed using vmd eemd and emd techniques the decomposition results in figs 7 9 indicate that the vmd decomposition method decomposes the original et0 time series of the urumqi station into seven independent imf components from the lowest to the highest frequencies the eemd decomposition method decomposes the time series into 12 independent imf components and a residual component in contrast the emd decomposition method decomposes the time series into ten independent imf components and a residual component the imf1 component in fig 7 the imf7 component in fig 8 and the imf6 component in fig 9 indicate apparent annual periodic variabilities in the et0 time series compared with eemd and emd decomposition methods vmd decomposition methods show more apparent periodic changes and effectively reduce mode mixing the eemd and emd methods residual components show an upward trend in the et0 time series after decomposition the nonlinear and non stationary time series can be converted into stationary time series which can help to improve the prediction ability of subsequent machine learning models 3 2 modeling approach when using the bpnn model to predict time series based on historical observation data of time series a key problem is how to select the input variables of the model correctly the formula for selecting input parameters can be expressed as 24 y t l e a d b p x t 1 x t 2 x t δ where y is the predicted et0 t is the current time δ is the embedding dimension l e a d is the prediction step size when lead 1 the et0 time series is predicted in one step that is the current day value is predicted with the data of δ days before the date to be measured therefore several input combinations are tried using the bpnn to forecast the et0 studied in this paper fig 10 shows the selection of input parameters therefore δ 9 is selected as the input parameter of the bpnn model this research refers to the et0 data for 24 years 1993 2016 the dataset is divided into training subset and testing subset with a ratio of 75 25 to design et0 forecasting machine learning models as cross validation evaluation methods such as hold out and k fold may lead to the issue of data leakage or modeling from hindsight i e the past data are used for evaluating the model whereas the future data are used for training the model lv et al 2022 the time series data is defined in chronological order sequence in order to keep the structure of the sequence complete the order sequence must be retained here the bpnn model with strong universality are employed and three robust decomposition methods are applied to improve the stability of time series data to prevent variables with large numerical ranges dominating variables with small numerical range in the models and accelerate the models training process and convergence the normalization and denormalization processes of training and prediction sets are adopted the bpnn prediction model is constructed based on setting and optimizing the parameters this paper establishes the bpnn model using matlab software table 2 shows the training parameters of the bpnn model this paper determines the number of hidden layer nodes to obtain satisfactory prediction results since there is no standard rule to determine the hidden layer calisir et al 2023 one of the challenges in developing the bpnn models is to optimize the number of neurons in the hidden layer the number of hidden layer nodes can be determined by manual search methods trial and error strategy barzegar et al 2019 wang et al 2015 since the input parameter is determined as 9 the number of output layer nodes is 1 the number of hidden layer nodes is changed between 4 and 13 and their corresponding errors are compared finally the model with the minimum error is selected table 3 describes the hidden layer selection of the vmd bpnn model in 11 stations 4 results and analysis 4 1 accuracy analysis of et0 daily value predicted by the backpropagation neural network model with different decomposition methods table 4 shows the accuracy indices of emd bpnn eemd bpnn and vmd bpnn at urumqi station as shown in table 4 rmse 0 75 mae 0 5 r2 0 92 and nse 0 92 for the three models at urumqi station demonstrating high reliability comparing the three hybrid models the vmd bpnn hybrid model provides rmse 0 405 mm d mae 0 268 mm d r2 0 979 and nse 0 977 accordingly its prediction accuracy and stability are superior to emd bpnn and eemd bpnn models fig 11 compares the target and predicted values of eemd bpnn vmd bpnn and emd bpnn models in the urumqi station in the prediction set as shown in fig 11 the difference between the least square regression lsr line of the vmd bpnn mixed model and the standard value and 45 line was the smallest reflecting high accuracy the difference between the emd bpnn model and the lsr line of the standard value and 45 line was significant and the prediction accuracy was relatively low the predicted value of the eemd bpnn model was higher than the standard value in case of high evapotranspiration the predicted value of the emd bpnn model was lower than the standard value there are many discrete points between the eemd bpnn and emd bpnn models the prediction accuracy of the vmd bpnn model in the overall interval of evapotranspiration was higher than that of the other two models because the imf component obtained by vmd decomposition was smoother than that obtained by eemd and emd decomposition niu et al 2018 and modal aliasing was avoided vmd better expressed the change law of et0 than eemd and emd 4 2 prediction accuracy analysis of the vmd bpnn model at different stations table 5 compares the evaluation parameters of the 1 day prediction et0 results of the vmd bpnn model at different stations to evaluate the general applicability of the model in xinjiang as presented in table 5 the prediction accuracy of the vmd bpnn model at all stations in xinjiang was high with rmse less than 0 6 mm d mae less than 0 4 mm d r2 greater than 0 89 and nse greater than 0 91 among them the r2 and nse of 80 of stations were about 0 98 and the simulation accuracy and stability were generally good among them aksu station had the best prediction accuracy with rmse 0 346 mm d mae 0 234 mm d r2 0 994 and nse 0 998 generally the vmd bpnn model could adapt to the simulation calculation of et0 in xinjiang 4 3 the analysis of the prediction accuracy of et0 within seven days by the vmd bpnn model in order to evaluate the vmd bpnn model s prediction accuracy on days 1 3 5 and 7 table 5 compares the predicted parameters of the vmd bpnn model when the prediction period is days 1 3 5 and 7 as shown in table 6 as the prediction period increased rmse of the vmd bpnn model increased from 0 405 to 0 588 mae increased from 0 268 to 0 382 r2 decreased from 0 979 to 0 954 nse decreased from 0 977 to 0 952 and the prediction accuracy and stability decreased for a seven day prediction period the nse and r2 of the model were greater than 0 95 with mae 0 382 and rmse 0 588 indicating the high accuracy and stability of the vmd bpnn model in short term prediction in order to more accurately evaluate the model s accuracy three categories can be formed according to the et0 value low evapotranspiration medium evapotranspiration and high evapotranspiration correspond to the et0 values lower than 1 mm between 1 mm and 5 mm and greater than 5 mm respectively fig 12 shows the comparison of mean deviation md between the vmd bpnn model and the standard value of the low medium and high evapotranspiration on the 1 day 3 day 5 day and 7 day forecasting periods as depicted in fig 12 the absolute value of md of low evapotranspiration was less than 0 1 the absolute value of md of medium evapotranspiration increased from 0 15 on day 1 0 26 on day 7 while increasing the prediction period the absolute value of md of high evapotranspiration increased from 0 22 on day 1 0 37 on day 7 while increasing the prediction period the minimum absolute value of md of the model simulation is obtained for low evapotranspiration followed by medium and high evapotranspiration the predicted results were higher and lower than the standard value on average while predicting low and high evapotranspiration respectively 4 4 comparison of the simulation accuracy of the vmd bpnn model with other single machine learning models table 7 compares the simulation accuracy of the vmd bpnn model with three single machine learning models bpnn svr and gbrt table 7 shows that the vmd bpnn hybrid model can provide rmse 0 405 mm d mae 0 268 mm d r2 0 979 and nse 0 977 the rmse and mae values of the vmd bpnn model were more than 60 smaller than those of bpnn svr and gbrt at the same time r2 and nse were more than 15 higher than those of the three models the model s prediction accuracy improved significantly after combining the vmd decomposition method with the bpnn model besides the r2 and nse values were higher than 0 95 this indicated the relatively poor robustness of the bpnn model and its weak prediction ability if the previous data were not processed by technology the vmd model reduces the non stationarity behavior of the original data and the interference components in the original data the bpnn model predicted the decomposed imf components due to its strong nonlinear mapping ability the prediction accuracy of the vmd bpnn model was significantly improved compared with that of a vmd model accordingly it could predict et0 more accurately fig 13 compares the simulation error of the vmd bpnn model with the bpnn svr and gbrt models the four model errors were calculated by subtracting the predicted values from the actual ones as shown in fig 13 the vmd bpnn model provided the minimum error most of which were between 0 5 0 5 mm d the other three empirical models provided significant errors and many outliers indicating the low prediction stability of a single machine learning model 5 discussion this study indicated the good accuracy and stability of the vmd bpnn hybrid prediction model in predicting the daily scale reference crop evapotranspiration et0 time series compared with the time domain adaptive decomposition methods eemd and emd the vmd method has a clearer theoretical basis higher decomposition accuracy and effectively reduces mode aliasing guo et al 2022 besides the vmd method requires less prior knowledge of input signals and show more apparent periodic changes the vmd bpnn model makes a short term prediction on subsequences while improving the bpnn s prediction accuracy under the input with a short time delay moreover the time series can be decomposed by modal decomposition which can effectively reduce the nonstationary data of the reference crop evapotranspiration time series optimize the bpnn structure reduce the computational complexity and effectively improve the bpnn s prediction performance the vmd bpnn model provides a good prediction effect and can predict nonlinear and non stationary reference crop evapotranspiration time series the vmd bpnn model provides a high accuracy for predicting the daily scale time series when the forecasting period is 3 days and 7 days the model s performance degrades slightly this also prompted subsequent model improvement and weekly and monthly et0 prediction model research malik et al 2022 suggested that the deep learning based model could predict reference crop evapotranspiration in india with different climates in advance by multiple steps t 3 t 7 in the 7 day et0 prediction the performance of the hybrid machine learning model degrades slightly the performance indicators demonstrated that the accuracy of the vmd bpnn model results in a 7 days prediction period was slightly lower than that in the one day prediction period which agreed with the research results of malik et al 2022 this demonstrates the feasibility of the vmd bpnn model in predicting the daily reference crop evapotranspiration time series in the study area in terms of model portability analysis to evaluate the adaptability of the vmd bpnn model in xinjiang the et0 calculated by the fao 56 pm formula from 1993 to 2010 at urumqi station is utilized as the training set and the et0 from 2011 to 2016 at ten stations including altay tacheng yining yanqi turpan aksu kashgar ruoqiang hotan and hami is taken as the prediction set for simulation the relevant parameters are calculated according to the model evaluation method and the prediction results are compared with the standard values fig 14 shows a scatter plot of the standard value and the predicted output of the vmd bpnn model the portability analysis results indicate that under the cross combination of training and prediction stations the vmd bpnn model provides the highest prediction accuracy nse and r2 0 95 and the simulation accuracy in some regions is even higher than in the original region therefore the vmd bpnn model can predict the short term et0 between the xinjiang stations with strong applicability fig 15 is a violin chart comparing the standard values of the bpnn and vmd bpnn model prediction results fig 15 shows that the distribution of the overall prediction results of the vmd bpnn model is compatible with the distribution of the standard values while the distribution of the overall prediction results of the bpnn model is quite different from the standard values when the et0 is high the prediction results of the vmd bpnn model are generally small with specific limitations and the model s reliability will be reduced the proposed vmd bpnn model only simulates the reference crop evapotranspiration in xinjiang china in the follow up study more reference crop evapotranspiration forecasts in different climatic regions will be performed to make better decisions for the agricultural irrigation system 6 conclusion a combination of the vmd and bpnn methods vmd bpnn was employed to predict et0 in xinjiang the results demonstrated that the vmd bpnn prediction model could accurately predict et0 in xinjiang and provide high accuracy and stability the following conclusions can be drawn from simulations 1 a comparison of emd bpnn eemd bpnn and vmd bpnn with bpnn svr and gbrt indicated that the et0 prediction s accuracy of the hybrid prediction model was significantly higher than that of a single machine learning model the prediction accuracy of the vmd bpnn model was higher than that of the emd bpnn and eemd bpnn models especially in the high evapotranspiration prediction emd bpnn and eemd bpnn models reflected an apparent unorganized point set and the performance of the vmd bpnn model was superior therefore the vmd bpnn model could be employed for et0 simulation and prediction in xinjiang 2 the universal applicability of the vmd bpnn model was analyzed in 11 stations in xinjiang it provided high prediction accuracy in all meteorological stations in xinjiang except for yanqi and altay stations the model nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and determination coefficient r2 exceeded 0 97 under the cross combination of training and prediction stations the model s accuracy was high indicating the strong universality of the vmd bpnn model in xinjiang 3 according to the reliability analysis of the vmd bpnn model for the prediction periods of 1 day 3 days 5 days and 7 days the simulation accuracy decreased while increasing the prediction period for a 7 day prediction period nse and r2 were greater than 0 95 indicating the ability of the vmd bpnn model in predicting the et0 in xinjiang in the short term with high prediction accuracy and stability levels declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

9071,this study examines the impacts of farmers drought severity perceptions on two adaptation strategies ex ante use of drought tolerant varieties and ex post irrigation use employing a large scale survey data of maize farmers in northern china the former is helpful for saving water while the latter may increase the intensity of water use in drought season an endogenous switching probit model is employed to account for the potential selection bias and endogeneity of farmers drought severity perceptions in regressions of adaptation strategies the results show that perceiving increasing drought severity might increase farmers probabilities of using drought tolerant varieties dtvs by 8 1 on maize plots but lower the probability of irrigation by 15 1 however once the use of the dtvs is controlled for the perception of drought severity has no additional predictive powers for irrigation furthermore the use of drought tolerant varieties may reduce the probability of irrigation by 27 5 the findings highlight the need for policymakers to enhance farmers perceptions and differentiate adaptation options and consider their interrelationships in allocating resources to maximise their effectiveness keywords drought tolerant varieties irrigation endogenous switching probit model treatment effects data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction frequent and severe droughts with longer durations are the likely outcomes of increased climate variations for many countries e g leng et al 2015 calzadilla et al 2013 which will negatively affect agricultural productivity and farm household livelihoods identifying adaptation strategies to prevent and or mitigate the negative effects has important implications for rural welfare and is an issue that policymakers must address farmers adaptations to drought risk are also key for food security competitiveness of rural communities environmental pollution and resource depletion wang et al 2021 the relatively large literature on adaptation strategies show that adaptations come in a wide variety of forms such as crop choices crop insurance tillage diversification off farm labour allocation risk management strategies etc smit and pilifosova 2001 ding et al 2009 meraner and finger 2019 turvey and kong 2010 these strategies can differ by purposefulness autonomous vs planned temporal scope short or long term spatial scope individual local regional national or global and form technical behavioural financial and institutional one important way of differentiation is based on whether adaptations are implemented before ex ante adaptation or after ex post adaptation the occurrence of extreme weather events smit et al 2000 distinguishing between ex ante and ex post adaptations can improve design of climate policies and allocations of funds rural households in developing countries are among the most vulnerable to adverse impacts of climate change barbier and hochard 2018 they usually do not have access to emergency funds credit or community resources and can only cope with negative shocks ex post báez et al 2017 implementing ex ante adaptations can be more beneficial and cost effective for such groups simulations by owens et al 2004 show that reallocating funds from ex post responses to drought shocks to ex ante actions could raise household welfare the relationships between ex ante and ex post adaptations also provide important policy implications for example if ex ante and ex post adaptations are substitutes in terms of adaptive actions and ex ante measures are more effective additional resources should be allocated to ex ante measures however only a few studies distinguish between ex ante and ex post adaptations e g hertel lobell 2014 many studies also focus on identifying the factors that influence adaptation decisions deressa et al 2009 wolf et al 2013 chen et al 2014 huang et al 2015 wang et al 2015 alam et al 2016 hou et al 2017 dang et al 2019 islam et al 2020 one such factor is the perception of increased climate variations including extreme weather events different studies have measured perceptions differently the indicators constructed include perceptions of climate or drought trends and variability e g maddison 2007 rashid et al 2014 hou et al 2017 concerns of climate change impact e g shi et al 2015 judgements of causes of climate change e g yu et al 2013 and perceived local vulnerability spence et al 2011 lee et al 2015 found that the perception of local temperature change was the strongest predictor of climate change risk perceptions in many african and asian countries among the few studies that focus on farmers perceptions measurements are more unified and often related to changes in temperature and or precipitation for example salau et al 2012 reported that 63 of the nigerian farmers perceived rising temperature and 70 perceived erratic rainfall rashid et al 2014 reported that farmers in bangladesh perceived overall changes in rainfall patterns temperatures and frequency and intensity of cyclonic storms understanding climate change perceptions can be a critical step in enhancing adaptation capacity for several reasons first climate change perceptions can motivate the public to act to respond to climate change and to comply with policy measures shi et al 2015 yu et al 2013 spence et al 2011 showed that respondents from the united kingdom who perceived a greater local vulnerability to climate change impacts were more prepared to reduce their energy use hou et al 2017 demonstrated that chinese farmers who perceived increasing drought severity were more likely to adapt by using water saving technologies in india by increasing the shared notion of risk and vulnerability climate variability perceptions facilitated adaptive responses such as the formation of the apple growers association vedwan 2006 second it is possible to influence stakeholder perceptions through measures such as information campaigns hou et al 2017 found that providing early warnings of droughts to chinese farmers increases the likelihood of a perception of increased drought severity by 20 third there is room for improving stakeholders climate change perceptions hou et al 2015 found that only 18 of the sample chinese farmers had perceptions of local temperature change that were consistent with the actual trend calculated with climate data recorded at meteorological stations this study aims to analyze the linkages between farmers climate change perceptions in terms of drought severity and ex ante and ex post adaptations in theory the impacts of farmers drought severity perceptions on their ex ante and ex post adaptations can be derived 1 1 a detailed theoretical framework regarding the impacts of farmers drought severity perceptions on their ex ante and ex post adaptations can be found in appendices b based on the expected utility model by referring the studies of foudi and erdlenbruch 2012 lehmann n and finger 2014 and jianjun et al 2015 while previous studies have focused on the relations between farmers perceptions and adaptation strategies e g spence et al 2011 fosu mensah et al 2012 comoé et al 2014 few analyses empirically investigate the possible difference in the impacts of perceptions on ex ante and ex post adaptations and particularly explore the impact of using ex ante adaptation strategies on the use of ex post adaptation strategies in practice farmers have many adaptation strategies to drought risks for instance adopting new technology planting new crop varieties purchasing crop insurance crop diversification investing in irrigation infrastructure jianjun et al 2015 this study focuses on the use of drought tolerant varieties and irrigation as they are the most direct related measures with water the study on these two strategies helps better understand the design of agricultural water saving strategies under drought risks to achieve the objectives a large scale farm survey data in china were applied in this study an endogenous switching probit model is used to solve the potential endogeneity of farmers perceptions in their decision process the rest of the paper is organised as follows section 2 presents the data sources and the employed methods section 3 reports the descriptive statistics of farmers drought severity perceptions and their ex ante and or ex post adaptations and also reports the estimation results of empirical models the final section concludes with major findings and policy implications 2 materials and methods 2 1 data sources the data used in this study are from a nationally representative survey conducted at the end of 2012 which covers nine provinces in china s five major grain producing regions the spatial distributions of water resources are not even in china although south china has relatively abundant water resources north china is one of the most water scarce areas worldwide and is vulnerable to droughts ji et al 2010 therefore this study only includes sample provinces located in north china five provinces in north china plain hebei henan shandong anhui and jiangsu and jilin province in northeast china overall these six provinces produced over 40 of china s maize in 2015 according to china s national statistical data in each sample province we first identified all the counties that experienced one or more drought years as well as normal years during the 2010 2012 period china s national standard for natural disasters established by the china meteorological administration classifies the severity of drought into four categories most severe 4 severe 3 moderate 2 and small 1 a drought year is defined as a year during which one or more level 3 or 4 droughts have occurred while other years are categorised as normal years three counties were then randomly selected from all the counties that experienced both drought and normal years within each county townships were stratified into three groups based on the share of irrigable land areas and the degree of reliability of irrigation water supply as assessed by the county s water conservancy bureau random selection of one township three villages in that township and ten farm households from each village was conducted respectively for each sample household two plots were randomly selected from all the plots that were cultivated during both the drought and normal years plots that grew the same crop in both years were given higher priority of selection only sample households that grew maize were included each maize household may have one or two plots that were surveyed the final sample included 1695 maize plots from 1058 households in 123 villages from 14 counties during the survey household heads and village leaders were interviewed with separate questionnaires household heads were asked to report if they thought drought severity i e the number of days that drought lasted over the past decade had increased decreased or shown no observable change for each selected plot we asked the respondents whether they used dtvs and how many times they irrigated maize these questions were asked for both the normal and drought years table a 5 in appendices a shows farmers perception of drought severity and the adoptions of dtvs and irrigation under the different perceptions obviously when farmers perceive increasing drought severity their adoptions of dtvs and irrigation are significantly different with others thus farmers perception of drought can be further treated as dummy variable perception of increasing drought severity 1 yes no others while there are 8 farmers reporting no observable change of drought severity these samples only occupy less than 1 of total sample and will not lead to bias results due to assigning into other group the survey also collected information on farmers characteristics e g age education gender and family size farm characteristics e g farm size and distance to the nearest agriculture supply shop village leaders were interviewed for gaining information on village characteristics e g proportion of irrigable land and availability of drought mitigation support in the village 2 2 methods this section presents the methods to examine how farmers drought severity perceptions influence their adaptive actions in our analysis we can control for many factors that have been identified to influence farmers perceptions of and their adaptation to climate change such as demographic and socio economic factors geography and access to extension service rashid et al 2014 hou et al 2015 lee et al 2015 leiserowitz 2007 akter and bennett 2011 deressa et al 2011 dang et al 2014 however there might still be unobservable or missing factors due to a lack of information oster 2019 for example cognitive and psychological factors such as fatalism values and cultural worldviews can shape perceptions of climate change and adaptive behaviours shi et al 2015 spence et al 2011 lorenzoni and pidgeon 2006 wolf et al 2013 weber 2010 grothmann and reusswig 2006 agricultural water related policies e g pricing quotas etc may also affect farmers dtvs use and irrigation use lehmann and finger 2014 while the policy effect can be controlled by the township dummy variables as the implementation of related policies are supposed to be same in a township past exposure to extreme weather events is another such factor spence et al 2011 besides in regressions on adaptive actions perception may be endogenous and reverse causality may exist past use of adaptive strategies may modify farmers perception because drought impacts may be altered by adaptation it is essential to account for the potential perception endogeneity in case one or more important factors are excluded furthermore the coefficients of explanatory variables which measure their effects on adaptive actions may vary among farmers that perceive increasing or lower drought severity to address above issues following previous studies lokshin and glinskaya 2008 gregory colemanjensen 2013 ayuya et al 2015 we employ the endogenous switching probit model espm based on the instrumental variable and full information maximum likelihood methods the espm model takes into account unobserved variables that could simultaneously affect farmers drought severity perceptions and adaptive actions lokshin and glinskaya 2008 the instrumental variable approach could address the potential endogeneity issue for farmers drought severity perceptions in explaining their adaptive actions the full information maximum likelihood method fiml is used to simultaneously estimate the equations of farmers drought severity perceptions and adaptive actions to obtain consistent standard errors of the estimates lokshin and sajaia 2011 also the espm has one advantage that is the possibility of deriving probabilities in counterfactual cases for the impacts of farmers drought severity perceptions on their adaptations by simulating the average treatment effect lokshin and sajaia 2011 ayuya et al 2015 while there are also some other approaches such as propensity score matching psm approach or inverse probability weighted regression adjusted ipwra estimators which could be used to estimate the impact of farmers drought severity perceptions on their adaptations using observational data these approaches can not control the selection bias led by unobservable factors oster 2019 and hence are not superior to the espm in addressing the mentioned issues hence in this section the espm is used to estimate the perception effects on ex ante and ex post adaptations 2 2 1 impact of drought severity perceptions on farmers adaptations a two stage approach is used to model farmers drought severity perceptions and their influence on ex ante and ex post adaptations to drought in the first stage the latent variable p i measuring the drought severity perception of farmer i is expressed as a function of observable variables as 2 1 p i z i α ε i p i 1 p i 0 where 1 is an indicator function and p i is a binary variable that equals one if p i 0 and zero otherwise we divide farmers into two groups based on their perceptions perceivers of increasing drought p i 1 are farmers who thought drought severity had increased and non perceivers of increasing drought p i 0 are farmers who thought it had decreased or shown no observable change over the past decade farmers who reported they had no judgement of the trend were also put into non perceivers the vector z i contains variables that affect farmers drought severity perceptions and ε i is the error term with a mean zero in the second stage an endogenous switching framework is used to model the perception influence on adaptive actions wherein farmers face the two regimes defined in eq 2 1 perceivers p i 1 and non perceivers p i 0 2 2a v 1im x 1im θ 1 u 1i v 1im 1 v 1im 0 if p i 1 2 2b v 0im x 0im θ 0 u 0i v 0im 1 v 0im 0 if p i 0 where v im is a binary variable that equals one if dtvs or irrigation is used on plot m of farmer i the subscripts 1 and 0 represent perceivers and non perceivers respectively although the information on irrigation number is available among all irrigated maize plots more than 80 were only irrigated once or twice therefore the irrigation number cannot be treated as a continuous variable it is also difficult to run an endogenous switching model with ordinal dependent variables therefore a dummy variable that indicates a plot is irrigated is used as the dependent variable to examine the impact of climate change perception on irrigation as an adaptive action the espm has been used in many previous studies that have binary selections and binary outcomes lokshin and glinskaya 2008 gregory colemanjensen 2013 ayuya et al 2015 min et al 2017 we follow the procedure developed by lokshin and sajaia 2011 and account for the potential endogeneity of drought severity perceptions by estimating a simultaneous system of eqs 2 1 2 2a and 2 2b using full information maximum likelihood estimation fiml the error terms in the above mentioned equations are assumed to be jointly normally distributed with zero means as v 1im and v 0im are never observed for the same farmer plot the covariance between u 1i and u 0i is not defined however the estimation can still be carried out using the bivariate normal distribution between u 1i and ε i and between u 0i and ε i with their correlations defined as ρ 1 and ρ 0 respectively lokshin and sajaia 2011 the estimation results of espm can be used to calculate the effects of increasing drought severity perceptions on the use of adaptation strategies following lokshin and sajaia 2011 ayuya et al 2015 and min et al 2017 the effect of the treatment of increasing drought severity perception on the treated tt is 2 3 tt x im pr v 1im 1 p i 1 x im pr v 0im 1 p i 1 x im where pr v 1im 1 p i 1 x im and pr v 0im 1 p i 1 x im are the probabilities of using an adoption strategy on a plot by a farmer who perceives and one who does not perceive increasing drought severity respectively it is constructed using the fiml estimation results eq 2 3 measures the effect of increasing drought severity perceptions on the likelihood of using adaptation strategies among perceivers the average treatment effect on the treated att can be imputed by averaging eq 2 3 over the sample observations that perceived increasing drought severity p i 1 2 4 att σtt x im 1 pi 1 n pi 1 where 1 p i 1 is the indicator function for perceivers and n pi 1 is the number of observations with p i 1 perceivers similarly att can also be imputed for any subgroup of the sample by averaging eq 2 3 over all observations in that subgroup the estimates of att for subgroups provide an opportunity to detect the heterogeneous treatment impacts among subgroups and thereby can derive somewhat policy implications thus usually heterogeneity analysis is conducted by choosing an explanatory variable of policy relevance and estimating the treatment effects for subsamples defined by this variable in the empirical analysis we assess atts for subgroups defined by access to irrigation weather conditions drought or normal year farm size availability of drought mitigation support and distance from plot to the house the vector x im contains variables that may influence either costs or benefits of adaptation strategies five groups of variables are used the first measure plot characteristics such as plot size soil type and distance to a farmer s house as well as whether a plot has access to irrigation the size of a plot affects the extent of the exposure to weather risks in agricultural production it can also affect the benefit or the cost of the adaptive action farmers with more fertile soil may be better buffered from the negative impacts of droughts therefore they may be less likely to take adaptive actions the second group measures farm characteristics such as age gender and education of the household head family size and share of family members that are engaged in off farm work all these variables affect farmers adaptive decisions for example access to off farm employment opportunities can reduce the impact of shocks to agricultural production on rural households and thus may affect their incentives to take adaptive actions giles 2000 income from off farm jobs can be also used as an adaptation investment in the agricultural sector the third group measures farm characteristics such as farm size and distance to the nearest agriculture supply shop the fourth group includes two village level variables the first variable indicates the availability of drought mitigation support in the village drought mitigation support in rural china can include technical assistance to farmers to set up adaptive measures post disaster cash or in kind assistance extension services that provide technical support for drought mitigation can be an important means for farmers to gain information on the likelihood of droughts as well as technical knowledge of mitigation strategies post disaster assistance however may hamper farmers incentive to be proactive the share of irrigable land in the village reflects the overall irrigation conditions of the village current weather conditions such as levels of precipitation and temperature may affect the likelihood of using adaptation strategies this is particularly relevant for ex ante actions the fifth group includes a year dummy that equals one for a drought year and township dummies data on weather variables are only available at the county level in china the use of the township and year dummies in the regression helps control for current weather conditions to a large extent in the empirical analysis that examines the use of irrigation as an adaptation strategy only plots with access to irrigation are included the variable that indicates a plot has access to irrigation is thus removed from x im table a 1 in appendices a reports summary statistics of the explanatory variables used in this study while table a 2 in appendices a compares the means of the explanatory variables contained in x im between plots that used an adaptation strategy dtvs or irrigation and those that did not for the espm to be identified the vector z i should contain at least one variable that is not in x im and can be used as the exclusion restriction for each farmer i we average the drought severity perceptions of other farmers in the same village ap i such a cluster effect instrument has been used in previous studies ji et al 2010 zhao et al 2014 farmers perceptions of climate change are often influenced by peers however perceptions of peers are unlikely to directly influence a farmer s adaptation decisions except through their influence on the farmer s perception therefore ap i is a potential candidate for a selection instrument it is noticed that in a same township farmers normally share the agricultural extension services and supplier and output markets accordingly they may also directly influence respective activities such as irrigation and seed choice this means that the adaptation strategies of peers may also affect a farmer s adaptation decision nevertheless this situation does not matter for the estimation using the perception of peers as an instrumental variable following previous studies di falco et al 2011 ayuya et al 2015 huang et al 2015 parvathi and waibel 2016 falsification tests are performed results in table a 3 of appendices a support the validity of the ap i variable as a selection instrument the coefficient of the ap i variable is statistically significant when perception is the dependent variable column 1 in columns 2 and 3 where only non perceivers are included p i 0 and the dependent variables are the two adaptation strategies the use of dtvs and irrigation the coefficients of the ap i variable are not statistically significant additionally weak instrument tests using f statistics reject the null hypothesis of a weak instrument 2 2 2 relationship between the use of dtvs and irrigation the analysis of the relationship between ex ante and ex post adaptations can yield useful policy advice if dtvs and irrigation were substitutes in preventing mitigating the negative impacts associated with droughts policymakers could focus on just one instead of both strategies for example in areas with scarce water resources the use of dtvs may be preferred due to the additional benefit of water conservation for farmers without access to irrigation planting dtvs also has the advantage of not requiring a high upfront fixed investment unlike the development of new irrigation facilities the relationships between dtvs and irrigation can be assessed by examining if the decision to use one strategy is influenced by the use of another strategy however the use of one strategy is likely to be endogenous in the regression on the decision to use another strategy this may be the case even when we examine the influence of an ex ante strategy on an ex post strategy although the use of dtvs precedes the irrigation decision temporally it may still be an endogenous variable this can happen due to the omission of factors such as past exposures to droughts that can influence both decisions a valid instrumental variable iv would only affect farmers decisions to use dtvs the usage rate of dtvs among other farmers in the same village is employed to instrument for a farmer s dtv use this is likely to be influenced by peers affected by peers adoption of dtvs a farmer may have a similar adoption decision to dtvs before seeding maize hereafter the farmer s dtvs adoption situation further influences the decision to irrigation during the growing season of maize the results of falsification tests valid this proposed iv empirically too two models are used namely a probit model where the dependent variable is a dummy variable that indicates a plot is irrigated and dtv use is an explanatory variable and the espm in the first stage a selection equation is run with dtv use as the dependent variable in the second stage an endogenous switching model is employed to model dtv use impact on irrigation decisions where farmers face two regimes using or not using dtvs 3 results and discussion 3 1 descriptive statistics although some studies predict the changes in drought severity duration and frequency in china e g leng et al 2015 there is no consensus on this among the sample farmers most farmers 71 perceive increasing drought severity table a 2 in appendices a sample data also reveal a sharp difference in the use rates of the two adaptation strategies with dtvs being used on 26 8 of the plots irrigation is more widely used about 76 of the plots have access to irrigation of which about 79 were irrigated during the survey years table a 4 in appendices a shows that the difference in shares of maize plots with dtvs in normal and drought years 26 8 and 26 4 respectively is not statistically significant the same is the case when farmers are divided into perceivers and non perceivers these observations offer support for treating dtvs use as an ex ante adaptation strategy the decision is typically made before farmers observe the actual weather conditions during the growing season and thus is less correlated with the occurrence of droughts in contrast dtv use seems to be positively correlated with perceptions of increasing drought severity in normal years dtvs are used on 29 2 and 21 5 of plots among farmers that perceive increasing drought severity and those that perceive the same or declining drought severity respectively the 7 7 difference is statistically significant at 1 in drought years the same pattern is observed the use rate is 8 higher among perceivers and the difference is statistically significant at 1 unlike dtv use irrigation use varies with weather conditions among all maize plots with access to irrigation the share of irrigated plots is 3 higher in drought years the difference is statistically significant at the 10 level and provides some support for treating irrigation as an ex post adaptation to drought in maize production non perceivers are more likely to use irrigation as an ex post adaptive strategy among perceivers the shares of irrigated plots do not differ much between normal and drought years the share of irrigated plots among non perceivers is 8 4 higher in drought years than normal years the difference is statistically significant at 1 level the decisions regarding ex post and ex ante adaptations might be correlated in both normal and drought years dtv non users irrigated a larger share of their plots than users the difference however is only statistically significant in normal years and can be mostly attributed to farmers significantly cutting back irrigation on plots with dtvs in normal years among plots without dtvs the irrigated share is only 1 8 lower in normal years than drought years and the difference is not statistically significant in contrast among plots with dtvs the irrigated share is 7 2 lower and the difference is statistically significant at 5 these observations also indicate that the effects of the ex ante dtv use and maybe other ex ante strategies on the ex post irrigation use work mostly to reduce irrigation this is probably because in areas with severe water shortages such as north china farmers often do not have the option to increase irrigation even in normal years 3 2 estimation results 3 2 1 farmers drought severity perceptions and the use of dtvs table 1 reports the estimation results of the models for dtv use the results of estimating espm with fiml are reported in columns 2 4 corresponding to eqs 2 1 2 2a and 2 2b for both the probit model and espm the wald χ 2 test statistic is statistically significant and different from zero suggesting the joint significance of all explanatory variables the test results justify the use of espm the wald χ 2 test of independent equations rejects the null hypothesis of the joint independence of eqs 2 1 2 2a and 2 2b thus the use of espm with fiml is more efficient than estimating the equations separately in particular the estimated correlation between the errors of eqs 2 1 and 2 2a ρ 1 is statistically significant and is 0 439 in magnitude this provides empirical evidence of a sample selectivity bias as drought severity perception and dtv use decisions are correlated at least among perceivers estimation should thus account for such endogenous switching column 2 in table 1 reports the estimation results for the impact on farmers perceptions denoted in eq 2 1 the results show a strong influence of peer perceptions on a farmer s drought severity perception the iv coefficient which is the average of the other farmers perceptions in the same village is positive and statistically significant at 1 it is also the largest compared to coefficients of other explanatory variables several farm and farmer characteristics also shape farmers drought severity perceptions having loam soil reduces the likelihood of increasing drought severity perceptions because better soil reduces the negative impacts of past droughts older farmers are less likely to perceive increasing drought severity education has the opposite effect on perception younger and more educated farmers may be more informed and aware of the notion of climate change and thus pay more attention to changes in drought severity farmers in larger families are more likely to perceive increasing drought severity as the coefficient measures the effect of one additional member and is not large the practical impact of family size on perceptions is unlikely to be large farm size is positively correlated with farmers increasing drought severity perception this may be because larger farms are more exposed to variations in weather conditions and experience larger negative impacts of weather shocks thus any changes in weather conditions may be more evident to farmers with larger farms the family members share with off farm work is negatively correlated with farmers increasing drought severity perception off farm employment may reduce the likelihood of increasing drought severity perception in several ways it may divert farmers attention away from their farms income from off farm work can also offset some of the negative drought impacts one surprising result is that drought mitigation support does not seem to influence farmers perception perhaps providing information about climate change is not part of the extension services currently offered in rural china the results of factors that may drive dtv use justify the use of an endogenous switching model table 1 columns 3 and 4 the signs magnitudes and or levels of statistical significance of the coefficients of many explanatory variables differ between perceivers and non perceivers the biggest differences lie in the effects of gender farm size and the availability of drought mitigation support the coefficients of these variables are small and not statistically significant among perceivers but much larger and statistically significant among non perceivers increasing drought severity perception makes male and female farmers equally likely to use dtvs it also makes farmers with larger or smaller farms equally likely to use dtvs farmers are likely to use dtvs regardless of the availability of drought mitigation support in contrast among non perceivers male farmers farmers with larger farms and farmers in villages with drought mitigation support are more likely than others to use dtvs another difference is the effect of the irrigable land share in the village its coefficient is positive among perceivers but negative among non perceivers the difference in the coefficients is large and statistically significant non perceivers in villages with better irrigation conditions are less likely to use dtvs which makes sense the positive correlation between better irrigation conditions and dtv use among perceivers is difficult to interpret and requires further investigation the results confirm the existence of heterogeneity between perceivers and non perceivers in the sample households and reveal the interactive effects between drought severity perception and other explanatory variables the estimation results of the espm are employed to perform a counterfactual analysis to quantify the impacts of farmers drought severity perception on the dtv use likelihood the att reported in table 2 shows that among perceivers the treatment of perceiving increasing drought severity increases the probability of using dtvs by 8 1 if perceivers did not perceive increasing drought severity their likelihood of using dtvs would be lower by 8 1 as currently dtvs are used on only 26 8 of sample plots an impact of 8 1 is large and practically important table 2 also reports the effects of perceiving increasing drought severity on dtv use by sample subgroups the results suggest that the effect is stronger on plots without access to irrigation the atts for increasing drought severity perception show a 9 8 and 7 5 increase in the probability of dtv use on plots without and with access to irrigation respectively plots without irrigation would incur much bigger yield losses if droughts occurred therefore increasing drought severity perception is more likely to induce farmers actions on such plots the atts do not differ much between normal and drought years 8 2 versus 8 0 providing further evidence that farmers use dtvs as an ex ante adaptation strategy the atts do vary with farm size sample farmers are divided into three equal portions based on farm size on farms where per capita land holdings are above 0 2 ha person top 33 farmers increasing drought severity perceptions increase the likelihood of dtv use by 22 5 on medium size farms where per capita land holdings range from 0 09 to 0 2 ha person middle 33 the att is still positive but much smaller 3 1 no effect is observed on small farms where per capita land holdings are below 0 09 ha person bottom 33 as droughts would have bigger impacts on larger farms increasing drought severity perception is more likely to induce farmers with larger farms to act the atts of increasing drought severity perceptions are lower in villages with drought mitigation support than those without such support 6 8 versus 14 9 this indicates that the availability of drought mitigation support muffles the effects of increasing drought severity perceptions on dtv use one possible explanation is that drought related extension services might be focusing more on post disaster assistance than educating farmers about climate change and offering support to establish proactive measures finally the positive effects of increasing drought severity perceptions on dtv use are larger on plots further away from home the plots are divided into three equal portions based on their distance to farmers houses the atts of increasing drought severity perception on plots more than 1 km away top 33 are almost twice that of plots closer by one explanation is that it is more time consuming to monitor the conditions of plots further away to assess irrigation needs using dtvs on those plots generate larger benefits in terms of labour time saved 3 2 2 farmers drought severity perceptions and irrigation table 3 reports the estimation results of espm for irrigation use on maize plots only plots with access to irrigation are included in the analysis the wald χ 2 test statistic of the model is statistically significant and different from zero indicating the joint significance of all explanatory variables however the wald χ 2 test of independent equations fails to reject the null hypothesis of the joint independence of the equations neither of the two estimated correlations between equations ρ 0 and ρ 1 is statistically significant suggesting that the hypothesis of no selection bias for farmers drought severity perception in explaining irrigation cannot be rejected therefore although espm use is valid it does not necessarily increase estimation efficiency relative to an approach that estimates eqs 2 1 2 2a and 2 2b separately most estimates of parameters in the selection eq 2 1 for the espm for irrigation table 3 column 1 are consistent with those for dtv use table 1 column 2 one interesting difference is the coefficient of the irrigable land share in the village is negative and statistically significant in table 3 but not in table 1 this means that irrigation conditions only shape drought severity perceptions for plots that have access to irrigation better irrigation conditions reduce the likelihood of perceiving increasing drought severity perhaps because irrigable plots in villages with better irrigation conditions are more sheltered from the negative drought impacts there are fewer differences in the coefficients of irrigation equations between perceivers and non perceivers table 3 columns 2 and 3 than those observed for dtv equations reported in table 1 for both perceivers and non perceivers farmers are more likely to irrigate loam and clay plots instead of sandy plots probably due to higher percolation rates on sandy plots for both groups the distance from a plot to a farmer s house is positively correlated with the probability of irrigation one significant difference lies in the gender effect among non perceivers a male household head increases the irrigation likelihood while no correlation is observed between gender and irrigation among perceivers the same difference is observed in table 1 another significant difference is while current weather conditions do not affect the irrigation likelihood among perceivers drought occurrence increases irrigation among non perceivers the coefficient of the dummy indicating a drought year is negative and statistically significant in the equation for non perceivers this difference is consistent with the observation from table a 4 in appendices a that non perceivers are more likely than perceivers to use irrigation as an ex post adaptive strategy table 4 reports the atts of perceiving increasing drought severity on irrigation overall increasing the drought severity perception reduces irrigation probability by 15 1 the negative effect is slightly stronger in drought years than normal years and is smaller on small farms than medium and large farms subgroups by the availability of drought mitigation support present the largest differences in atts the negative effect of perceiving increasing drought severity in villages that do not have drought mitigation support is more than twice the other villages the differences in atts among plots with varying distances to farmers houses are not statistically significant 3 2 3 relationship between dtv use and irrigation table 5 reports the estimation results of several models used to explore the dtv irrigation decision relationship columns 1 and 2 are both probit models where irrigation is the outcome and dtv use is added as an explanatory variable in column 2 the average drought severity perception of other farmers in the same village is used to instrument for a farmer s perception although the coefficient of perception is positive and statistically significant in the simple probit model column 1 in the iv probit model column 2 its magnitude drops to nearly zero and the statistical significance is lost therefore it is most likely that after the use of dtvs is controlled for drought severity perception does not have additional predictive powers for variations in irrigation decisions this is because that irrigation is more likely to be used as an ex post adaptation strategy irrigation decisions are made contingent on field and weather conditions during the growing season not on perceptions formed before the growing season in both columns 1 and 2 the coefficients of the variable indicating dtv use are negative and statistically significant pointing to a negative correlation between dtv use and irrigation on maize plots the espm with fiml estimation is presented in columns 3 5 column 3 is the selection equation for dtv use columns 4 and 5 are the switching equations on irrigation for dtv users and non users perception is not included because it does not seem to have predictive powers once dtv use is controlled for the share of other farmers in the same village that used dtvs is used to instrument for a farmer s dtv use the coefficient of the iv is positive and statistically significant at 1 table a 5 in appendices a the results of espm in columns 3 5 could be further used to conduct a counterfactual analysis of the impact of dtv use on irrigation table 6 reports the atts computed from the estimation results of the espm the direction of the atts is consistent with that in the simple probit model the treatment of using dtvs decreases the probability of irrigation by 27 5 according to the results in table 2 4 6 together the relationships among drought severity perception dtv use and irrigation can be summarised as follows perceiving increasing drought severity increases dtv use likelihood and reduces irrigation likelihood in maize production further it is likely that the negative effect of perception on irrigation mainly works through the negative correlation between using dtvs and irrigation table 6 also reports the atts of using dtvs on irrigation by sample subgroups the results suggest the negative effect is stronger in normal years than in drought years 25 3 versus 29 6 reduction irrigation likelihood this is consistent with the observation in table a 4 in appendices a that dtv non users irrigate a larger share of their plots than users but the difference is statistically significant only in normal years this finding may be more important for areas that use groundwater less water use in normal years means more water would be available in aquifers during drought years the negative effect dtv use on irrigation is stronger on large farms than on medium or small farms the atts do not differ much between villages with and without drought mitigation support and are larger in magnitudes on plots further away from farmers houses 3 3 robustness check to confirm the stability of the main findings of this study we further conduct a set of robustness checks as follows first we re estimate the impacts of drought perception on using dtvs and irrigation by adjusting samples considering the geographic distribution of sample provinces in this study all provinces are located in northern china in addition to jiangsu province thus we drop the samples from jiangsu and re estimate the empirical models as shown in table a 6 in appendices a for the samples from all northern provinces the impact of drought perception on dtvs use gets smaller than that of previous results while both drought perception and dtvs use have more negative impacts on irrigation than before hence although the magnitudes of atts changed their significances and impact directions are completely same with our main results these results not only confirm the stability of the main findings but also imply heterogeneous effects of farmers drought perceptions on adaptation strategies in different regions second the impact of increasing drought severity perceptions on dtvs use is re estimated by employing the two steps and control function approach table a 6 in appendices a the marginal effect of drought perception on dtvs use is significantly positive consistent with the att of main results however the combination approach of two steps and control function cannot control for the potential selection bias accordingly here the marginal effect of increasing drought severity perceptions on dtvs use is over estimated third the irrigation model is re estimated by using a variable of irrigation count whilst the endogenous treatment poisson regression is further employed as shown in table a 6 in appendices a the atts of drought perception and dtvs use on irrigation count are both significantly negative the results are in line with the main results and further confirm that perceiving increasing drought severity and using dtvs can reduce the use of irrigation 4 conclusions in response to drought maize farmers in north china may have both ex ante and ex post adaptations while this study focuses on two adaptation strategies the ex ante adoption of dtvs and the ex post use of irrigation farmers perception of increasing drought severity can increase the probability of using dtvs by 8 1 and lower the probability of irrigation by 15 1 on maize plots however once dtv use is controlled for perception does not seem to have additional predictive powers for irrigation implying that irrigation decisions are made not on perceptions formed before the growing season instead dtv use reduces the probability of irrigation by 27 5 confirming that dtv use is effective for saving irrigation water this study contributes to the existing literature of the impacts of farmers perceptions on their adaptation to climate change as shown in most studies abid et al 2020 brüssow et al 2019 dang et al 2019 farmers who perceived climate change are more likely to take adaption actions our study provides additional evidence for the positive linkage between perceptions and adaptation behaviour moreover this study distinguished ex ante and ex post adaptations and found out perceptions may have different impacts on different types of adaptation measures similar to our results brüssow et al 2019 found that farmers in tanzania who perceived climate change are more likely to take short term adaptations rather than investment intensive method such as building irrigation system hou et al 2017 found that farmers perceiving increasing drought are more likely to adopt water saving technologies but they did not distinguish ex ante and ex post adaptations this paper also advanced the literature by setting up a conceptual framework to describe the linkages between perceptions and different types of adaptation measures few existing studies presented theoretical models the findings of this study have three policy implications first the positive effect of perceiving increasing drought severity on dtv use suggested that policy makers can improve adoption of dtv through increasing farmers perceptions of climate change less than 30 of our sample plot used dtvs indicating large scope for boosting its use second our results also suggest that several channels that could improve farmers perceptions for example educating influential farmers in the village about the changes in weather conditions would pay off as our results show that peer perceptions matter another example interventions that target large farms may be more effective third the linkage between ex ante and ex post adaptation measures suggest that it is of great important to distinguish types of adaptation measures as limited adaptation resources could be allocated efficiently in our example dtvs can reduce use of irrigation water this has significant policy implications especially for the areas with severe water shortage moreover in those areas targeting larger farms and villages where land is distributed more sparsely and further away from farmers houses to promote dtvs may achieve a larger reduction in irrigation water use under the constraint of water resource the water saving by using dtvs actually has huge external positive effect on the sustainability of economic social development and environment finally we call for further study on evaluating the optimal strategy mix i e how to allocate adaptation funding and efforts among different types of adaptation measures in our sample almost 80 of irrigable sample plots are irrigated while less than 30 use ex ante adaptations such as dtvs if ex ante adaptations can better hedge farmers against weather risks at lower costs compared to those of ex post adaptations more extension efforts and financial resources should be allocated towards ex ante adaptations declaration of

erdlenbruch 2012 lehmann n and finger 2014 and jianjun et al 2015 this study develops a conceptual model to capture the impacts of farmers drought severity perceptions on their ex ante and ex post adaptations based on the expected utility model in practice farmers have many adaptation strategies to drought risks for instance adopting new technology planting new crop varieties purchasing crop insurance crop diversification investing in irrigation infrastructure jianjun et al 2015 this study focuses on the use of drought tolerant varieties and irrigation as they are the most direct related measures with water the study on these two strategies helps better understand the design of agricultural water saving strategies under drought risks thus the use of drought tolerant varieties dtvs of maize is treated as an ex ante adaptation as this decision is made before the start of the growing season and is ex ante relative to the drought occurring in the growing season in contrast irrigation is an ex post adaptation to drought because the irrigation decision is made according to actual weather conditions sufficient precipitation could ensure maize is completely rain fed without the need for irrigation if a drought occurs then farmers will decide whether to irrigate thus in maize production irrigation decisions can be treated as an ex post adaptation to drought hence the conceptual model can be established through two stages the ex ante choice of maize variety in the first stage a decision model on dtv adoption in maize farming is developed based on the expected utility model and the household model of agricultural production the expected utility u i is assumed to be determined by the profit of the maize farming at the i th plot and its maximisation problem can be written as follows b 1 max u i max y i c k i f y i d y s t y i y k i l i i i i 1 2 k i 1 where l i represents the planting area of maize farming at the i th plot available to the farmer while i i denotes the irrigation condition of the i th plot the vector k i k i 1 k i 2 where k i 1 and k i 2 are dummy variables representing the variety use of the i th plot k i 1 1 denotes dtv k i 2 1 denotes conventional variety y i is a vector of outputs corresponding to k i given the planting area of maize l i and the irrigation condition i i of the i th plot while c k i is the cost function corresponding to k i in addition to the used variety k i the cost function c k i also depends on the variable inputs and the corresponding prices f y is the farmer s subjective probability density function for y i which is assumed to be solely related to the weather conditions w t in the coming crop season bai et al 2015 we assume that all maize farmers in the same location face the same market prices of maize maize varieties and inputs in the observation year according to our observations as no significant differences exist in the market prices of dtvs and conventional varieties the price variables are omitted in the utility function 1 as farmers do not know the weather conditions in the coming crop season w t they make the decision on x based on their prediction of the weather conditions here we assume that farmers prediction of weather conditions in the coming crop season w t ˆ can be expressed as b 2 w t ˆ g w t p where w t denotes the real weather conditions in previous years while p represents farmers perceptions of the weather condition change in previous years by incorporating the weather condition prediction function b 2 into the maximisation problem b 1 the optimal variety choice x it of the i th plot can be conceptually derived as b 3 x it z w t p c l i i i where the real weather conditions in previous years w t could be omitted as there is an implicit assumption that all farmers in the same location g faced the same weather conditions in previous years given this study s focus on drought adaptations the perception of a change in weather conditions p here is proxied by the drought severity perception p the optimal variety choice of the i th plot for using dtv can then be simplified as b 4 k i 1 z p c l i i i g where k i 1 1 indicates that the maize farmer adopts dtv at the i th plot otherwise 0 the formula b 4 reveals that the ex ante choice of using dtv on the i th plot depends on farmers perceptions of drought severity the input costs c of dtv and conventional variety the plot area l irrigation condition i and the location g of the i th plot the ex post choice of irrigation in the second stage the decision on irrigation is made according to the previous decision of dtv adoption and actual weather conditions hence in this stage the expected utility maximisation u i of the maize farming of the i th plot can be modified as b 5 max u i max y i c k i 1 i i g y i d y s t y i y k i 1 i i l i i i m 1 2 i im 1 where i i 1 and i i 2 are dummy variables representing the irrigation decision of the i th plot i i 1 1 denotes irrigate i i 2 1 denotes do not irrigate that constitute i i i i 1 i i 2 y i is a vector of outputs corresponding to k i 1 and i i given the area l i and irrigation condition i i of the i th plot c k i 1 i i is the cost function corresponding to k i 1 and i i the farmer s subjective probability density function g y is assumed to be related to weather conditions w t which includes both the actual weather conditions prevailing in the crop growing season w t 1 and the prediction in the coming crop season w t ˆ the optimal choice of i could thus be conceptually expressed as b 6 i t l w t w t 1 p c k i 1 l i i i where both the weather conditions in previous years w t and the actual weather conditions occurring in the crop growing season w t could be neglected by assuming weather conditions remain unchanged at the same location g the irrigation decision on the i th plot can be obtained and written as a function b 7 by incorporating the function b 4 into the function b 6 b 7 i i 1 l p c c l i i i g hence the drought severity perceptions determine the ex post irrigation decision of the i th plot also the ex post irrigation decision is affected by the input costs of maize farming using dtv and conventional variety at the i th plot c the input costs of irrigation at the i th plot c the planting area l i and irrigation condition of the i th plot i i and the location g 
9071,this study examines the impacts of farmers drought severity perceptions on two adaptation strategies ex ante use of drought tolerant varieties and ex post irrigation use employing a large scale survey data of maize farmers in northern china the former is helpful for saving water while the latter may increase the intensity of water use in drought season an endogenous switching probit model is employed to account for the potential selection bias and endogeneity of farmers drought severity perceptions in regressions of adaptation strategies the results show that perceiving increasing drought severity might increase farmers probabilities of using drought tolerant varieties dtvs by 8 1 on maize plots but lower the probability of irrigation by 15 1 however once the use of the dtvs is controlled for the perception of drought severity has no additional predictive powers for irrigation furthermore the use of drought tolerant varieties may reduce the probability of irrigation by 27 5 the findings highlight the need for policymakers to enhance farmers perceptions and differentiate adaptation options and consider their interrelationships in allocating resources to maximise their effectiveness keywords drought tolerant varieties irrigation endogenous switching probit model treatment effects data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction frequent and severe droughts with longer durations are the likely outcomes of increased climate variations for many countries e g leng et al 2015 calzadilla et al 2013 which will negatively affect agricultural productivity and farm household livelihoods identifying adaptation strategies to prevent and or mitigate the negative effects has important implications for rural welfare and is an issue that policymakers must address farmers adaptations to drought risk are also key for food security competitiveness of rural communities environmental pollution and resource depletion wang et al 2021 the relatively large literature on adaptation strategies show that adaptations come in a wide variety of forms such as crop choices crop insurance tillage diversification off farm labour allocation risk management strategies etc smit and pilifosova 2001 ding et al 2009 meraner and finger 2019 turvey and kong 2010 these strategies can differ by purposefulness autonomous vs planned temporal scope short or long term spatial scope individual local regional national or global and form technical behavioural financial and institutional one important way of differentiation is based on whether adaptations are implemented before ex ante adaptation or after ex post adaptation the occurrence of extreme weather events smit et al 2000 distinguishing between ex ante and ex post adaptations can improve design of climate policies and allocations of funds rural households in developing countries are among the most vulnerable to adverse impacts of climate change barbier and hochard 2018 they usually do not have access to emergency funds credit or community resources and can only cope with negative shocks ex post báez et al 2017 implementing ex ante adaptations can be more beneficial and cost effective for such groups simulations by owens et al 2004 show that reallocating funds from ex post responses to drought shocks to ex ante actions could raise household welfare the relationships between ex ante and ex post adaptations also provide important policy implications for example if ex ante and ex post adaptations are substitutes in terms of adaptive actions and ex ante measures are more effective additional resources should be allocated to ex ante measures however only a few studies distinguish between ex ante and ex post adaptations e g hertel lobell 2014 many studies also focus on identifying the factors that influence adaptation decisions deressa et al 2009 wolf et al 2013 chen et al 2014 huang et al 2015 wang et al 2015 alam et al 2016 hou et al 2017 dang et al 2019 islam et al 2020 one such factor is the perception of increased climate variations including extreme weather events different studies have measured perceptions differently the indicators constructed include perceptions of climate or drought trends and variability e g maddison 2007 rashid et al 2014 hou et al 2017 concerns of climate change impact e g shi et al 2015 judgements of causes of climate change e g yu et al 2013 and perceived local vulnerability spence et al 2011 lee et al 2015 found that the perception of local temperature change was the strongest predictor of climate change risk perceptions in many african and asian countries among the few studies that focus on farmers perceptions measurements are more unified and often related to changes in temperature and or precipitation for example salau et al 2012 reported that 63 of the nigerian farmers perceived rising temperature and 70 perceived erratic rainfall rashid et al 2014 reported that farmers in bangladesh perceived overall changes in rainfall patterns temperatures and frequency and intensity of cyclonic storms understanding climate change perceptions can be a critical step in enhancing adaptation capacity for several reasons first climate change perceptions can motivate the public to act to respond to climate change and to comply with policy measures shi et al 2015 yu et al 2013 spence et al 2011 showed that respondents from the united kingdom who perceived a greater local vulnerability to climate change impacts were more prepared to reduce their energy use hou et al 2017 demonstrated that chinese farmers who perceived increasing drought severity were more likely to adapt by using water saving technologies in india by increasing the shared notion of risk and vulnerability climate variability perceptions facilitated adaptive responses such as the formation of the apple growers association vedwan 2006 second it is possible to influence stakeholder perceptions through measures such as information campaigns hou et al 2017 found that providing early warnings of droughts to chinese farmers increases the likelihood of a perception of increased drought severity by 20 third there is room for improving stakeholders climate change perceptions hou et al 2015 found that only 18 of the sample chinese farmers had perceptions of local temperature change that were consistent with the actual trend calculated with climate data recorded at meteorological stations this study aims to analyze the linkages between farmers climate change perceptions in terms of drought severity and ex ante and ex post adaptations in theory the impacts of farmers drought severity perceptions on their ex ante and ex post adaptations can be derived 1 1 a detailed theoretical framework regarding the impacts of farmers drought severity perceptions on their ex ante and ex post adaptations can be found in appendices b based on the expected utility model by referring the studies of foudi and erdlenbruch 2012 lehmann n and finger 2014 and jianjun et al 2015 while previous studies have focused on the relations between farmers perceptions and adaptation strategies e g spence et al 2011 fosu mensah et al 2012 comoé et al 2014 few analyses empirically investigate the possible difference in the impacts of perceptions on ex ante and ex post adaptations and particularly explore the impact of using ex ante adaptation strategies on the use of ex post adaptation strategies in practice farmers have many adaptation strategies to drought risks for instance adopting new technology planting new crop varieties purchasing crop insurance crop diversification investing in irrigation infrastructure jianjun et al 2015 this study focuses on the use of drought tolerant varieties and irrigation as they are the most direct related measures with water the study on these two strategies helps better understand the design of agricultural water saving strategies under drought risks to achieve the objectives a large scale farm survey data in china were applied in this study an endogenous switching probit model is used to solve the potential endogeneity of farmers perceptions in their decision process the rest of the paper is organised as follows section 2 presents the data sources and the employed methods section 3 reports the descriptive statistics of farmers drought severity perceptions and their ex ante and or ex post adaptations and also reports the estimation results of empirical models the final section concludes with major findings and policy implications 2 materials and methods 2 1 data sources the data used in this study are from a nationally representative survey conducted at the end of 2012 which covers nine provinces in china s five major grain producing regions the spatial distributions of water resources are not even in china although south china has relatively abundant water resources north china is one of the most water scarce areas worldwide and is vulnerable to droughts ji et al 2010 therefore this study only includes sample provinces located in north china five provinces in north china plain hebei henan shandong anhui and jiangsu and jilin province in northeast china overall these six provinces produced over 40 of china s maize in 2015 according to china s national statistical data in each sample province we first identified all the counties that experienced one or more drought years as well as normal years during the 2010 2012 period china s national standard for natural disasters established by the china meteorological administration classifies the severity of drought into four categories most severe 4 severe 3 moderate 2 and small 1 a drought year is defined as a year during which one or more level 3 or 4 droughts have occurred while other years are categorised as normal years three counties were then randomly selected from all the counties that experienced both drought and normal years within each county townships were stratified into three groups based on the share of irrigable land areas and the degree of reliability of irrigation water supply as assessed by the county s water conservancy bureau random selection of one township three villages in that township and ten farm households from each village was conducted respectively for each sample household two plots were randomly selected from all the plots that were cultivated during both the drought and normal years plots that grew the same crop in both years were given higher priority of selection only sample households that grew maize were included each maize household may have one or two plots that were surveyed the final sample included 1695 maize plots from 1058 households in 123 villages from 14 counties during the survey household heads and village leaders were interviewed with separate questionnaires household heads were asked to report if they thought drought severity i e the number of days that drought lasted over the past decade had increased decreased or shown no observable change for each selected plot we asked the respondents whether they used dtvs and how many times they irrigated maize these questions were asked for both the normal and drought years table a 5 in appendices a shows farmers perception of drought severity and the adoptions of dtvs and irrigation under the different perceptions obviously when farmers perceive increasing drought severity their adoptions of dtvs and irrigation are significantly different with others thus farmers perception of drought can be further treated as dummy variable perception of increasing drought severity 1 yes no others while there are 8 farmers reporting no observable change of drought severity these samples only occupy less than 1 of total sample and will not lead to bias results due to assigning into other group the survey also collected information on farmers characteristics e g age education gender and family size farm characteristics e g farm size and distance to the nearest agriculture supply shop village leaders were interviewed for gaining information on village characteristics e g proportion of irrigable land and availability of drought mitigation support in the village 2 2 methods this section presents the methods to examine how farmers drought severity perceptions influence their adaptive actions in our analysis we can control for many factors that have been identified to influence farmers perceptions of and their adaptation to climate change such as demographic and socio economic factors geography and access to extension service rashid et al 2014 hou et al 2015 lee et al 2015 leiserowitz 2007 akter and bennett 2011 deressa et al 2011 dang et al 2014 however there might still be unobservable or missing factors due to a lack of information oster 2019 for example cognitive and psychological factors such as fatalism values and cultural worldviews can shape perceptions of climate change and adaptive behaviours shi et al 2015 spence et al 2011 lorenzoni and pidgeon 2006 wolf et al 2013 weber 2010 grothmann and reusswig 2006 agricultural water related policies e g pricing quotas etc may also affect farmers dtvs use and irrigation use lehmann and finger 2014 while the policy effect can be controlled by the township dummy variables as the implementation of related policies are supposed to be same in a township past exposure to extreme weather events is another such factor spence et al 2011 besides in regressions on adaptive actions perception may be endogenous and reverse causality may exist past use of adaptive strategies may modify farmers perception because drought impacts may be altered by adaptation it is essential to account for the potential perception endogeneity in case one or more important factors are excluded furthermore the coefficients of explanatory variables which measure their effects on adaptive actions may vary among farmers that perceive increasing or lower drought severity to address above issues following previous studies lokshin and glinskaya 2008 gregory colemanjensen 2013 ayuya et al 2015 we employ the endogenous switching probit model espm based on the instrumental variable and full information maximum likelihood methods the espm model takes into account unobserved variables that could simultaneously affect farmers drought severity perceptions and adaptive actions lokshin and glinskaya 2008 the instrumental variable approach could address the potential endogeneity issue for farmers drought severity perceptions in explaining their adaptive actions the full information maximum likelihood method fiml is used to simultaneously estimate the equations of farmers drought severity perceptions and adaptive actions to obtain consistent standard errors of the estimates lokshin and sajaia 2011 also the espm has one advantage that is the possibility of deriving probabilities in counterfactual cases for the impacts of farmers drought severity perceptions on their adaptations by simulating the average treatment effect lokshin and sajaia 2011 ayuya et al 2015 while there are also some other approaches such as propensity score matching psm approach or inverse probability weighted regression adjusted ipwra estimators which could be used to estimate the impact of farmers drought severity perceptions on their adaptations using observational data these approaches can not control the selection bias led by unobservable factors oster 2019 and hence are not superior to the espm in addressing the mentioned issues hence in this section the espm is used to estimate the perception effects on ex ante and ex post adaptations 2 2 1 impact of drought severity perceptions on farmers adaptations a two stage approach is used to model farmers drought severity perceptions and their influence on ex ante and ex post adaptations to drought in the first stage the latent variable p i measuring the drought severity perception of farmer i is expressed as a function of observable variables as 2 1 p i z i α ε i p i 1 p i 0 where 1 is an indicator function and p i is a binary variable that equals one if p i 0 and zero otherwise we divide farmers into two groups based on their perceptions perceivers of increasing drought p i 1 are farmers who thought drought severity had increased and non perceivers of increasing drought p i 0 are farmers who thought it had decreased or shown no observable change over the past decade farmers who reported they had no judgement of the trend were also put into non perceivers the vector z i contains variables that affect farmers drought severity perceptions and ε i is the error term with a mean zero in the second stage an endogenous switching framework is used to model the perception influence on adaptive actions wherein farmers face the two regimes defined in eq 2 1 perceivers p i 1 and non perceivers p i 0 2 2a v 1im x 1im θ 1 u 1i v 1im 1 v 1im 0 if p i 1 2 2b v 0im x 0im θ 0 u 0i v 0im 1 v 0im 0 if p i 0 where v im is a binary variable that equals one if dtvs or irrigation is used on plot m of farmer i the subscripts 1 and 0 represent perceivers and non perceivers respectively although the information on irrigation number is available among all irrigated maize plots more than 80 were only irrigated once or twice therefore the irrigation number cannot be treated as a continuous variable it is also difficult to run an endogenous switching model with ordinal dependent variables therefore a dummy variable that indicates a plot is irrigated is used as the dependent variable to examine the impact of climate change perception on irrigation as an adaptive action the espm has been used in many previous studies that have binary selections and binary outcomes lokshin and glinskaya 2008 gregory colemanjensen 2013 ayuya et al 2015 min et al 2017 we follow the procedure developed by lokshin and sajaia 2011 and account for the potential endogeneity of drought severity perceptions by estimating a simultaneous system of eqs 2 1 2 2a and 2 2b using full information maximum likelihood estimation fiml the error terms in the above mentioned equations are assumed to be jointly normally distributed with zero means as v 1im and v 0im are never observed for the same farmer plot the covariance between u 1i and u 0i is not defined however the estimation can still be carried out using the bivariate normal distribution between u 1i and ε i and between u 0i and ε i with their correlations defined as ρ 1 and ρ 0 respectively lokshin and sajaia 2011 the estimation results of espm can be used to calculate the effects of increasing drought severity perceptions on the use of adaptation strategies following lokshin and sajaia 2011 ayuya et al 2015 and min et al 2017 the effect of the treatment of increasing drought severity perception on the treated tt is 2 3 tt x im pr v 1im 1 p i 1 x im pr v 0im 1 p i 1 x im where pr v 1im 1 p i 1 x im and pr v 0im 1 p i 1 x im are the probabilities of using an adoption strategy on a plot by a farmer who perceives and one who does not perceive increasing drought severity respectively it is constructed using the fiml estimation results eq 2 3 measures the effect of increasing drought severity perceptions on the likelihood of using adaptation strategies among perceivers the average treatment effect on the treated att can be imputed by averaging eq 2 3 over the sample observations that perceived increasing drought severity p i 1 2 4 att σtt x im 1 pi 1 n pi 1 where 1 p i 1 is the indicator function for perceivers and n pi 1 is the number of observations with p i 1 perceivers similarly att can also be imputed for any subgroup of the sample by averaging eq 2 3 over all observations in that subgroup the estimates of att for subgroups provide an opportunity to detect the heterogeneous treatment impacts among subgroups and thereby can derive somewhat policy implications thus usually heterogeneity analysis is conducted by choosing an explanatory variable of policy relevance and estimating the treatment effects for subsamples defined by this variable in the empirical analysis we assess atts for subgroups defined by access to irrigation weather conditions drought or normal year farm size availability of drought mitigation support and distance from plot to the house the vector x im contains variables that may influence either costs or benefits of adaptation strategies five groups of variables are used the first measure plot characteristics such as plot size soil type and distance to a farmer s house as well as whether a plot has access to irrigation the size of a plot affects the extent of the exposure to weather risks in agricultural production it can also affect the benefit or the cost of the adaptive action farmers with more fertile soil may be better buffered from the negative impacts of droughts therefore they may be less likely to take adaptive actions the second group measures farm characteristics such as age gender and education of the household head family size and share of family members that are engaged in off farm work all these variables affect farmers adaptive decisions for example access to off farm employment opportunities can reduce the impact of shocks to agricultural production on rural households and thus may affect their incentives to take adaptive actions giles 2000 income from off farm jobs can be also used as an adaptation investment in the agricultural sector the third group measures farm characteristics such as farm size and distance to the nearest agriculture supply shop the fourth group includes two village level variables the first variable indicates the availability of drought mitigation support in the village drought mitigation support in rural china can include technical assistance to farmers to set up adaptive measures post disaster cash or in kind assistance extension services that provide technical support for drought mitigation can be an important means for farmers to gain information on the likelihood of droughts as well as technical knowledge of mitigation strategies post disaster assistance however may hamper farmers incentive to be proactive the share of irrigable land in the village reflects the overall irrigation conditions of the village current weather conditions such as levels of precipitation and temperature may affect the likelihood of using adaptation strategies this is particularly relevant for ex ante actions the fifth group includes a year dummy that equals one for a drought year and township dummies data on weather variables are only available at the county level in china the use of the township and year dummies in the regression helps control for current weather conditions to a large extent in the empirical analysis that examines the use of irrigation as an adaptation strategy only plots with access to irrigation are included the variable that indicates a plot has access to irrigation is thus removed from x im table a 1 in appendices a reports summary statistics of the explanatory variables used in this study while table a 2 in appendices a compares the means of the explanatory variables contained in x im between plots that used an adaptation strategy dtvs or irrigation and those that did not for the espm to be identified the vector z i should contain at least one variable that is not in x im and can be used as the exclusion restriction for each farmer i we average the drought severity perceptions of other farmers in the same village ap i such a cluster effect instrument has been used in previous studies ji et al 2010 zhao et al 2014 farmers perceptions of climate change are often influenced by peers however perceptions of peers are unlikely to directly influence a farmer s adaptation decisions except through their influence on the farmer s perception therefore ap i is a potential candidate for a selection instrument it is noticed that in a same township farmers normally share the agricultural extension services and supplier and output markets accordingly they may also directly influence respective activities such as irrigation and seed choice this means that the adaptation strategies of peers may also affect a farmer s adaptation decision nevertheless this situation does not matter for the estimation using the perception of peers as an instrumental variable following previous studies di falco et al 2011 ayuya et al 2015 huang et al 2015 parvathi and waibel 2016 falsification tests are performed results in table a 3 of appendices a support the validity of the ap i variable as a selection instrument the coefficient of the ap i variable is statistically significant when perception is the dependent variable column 1 in columns 2 and 3 where only non perceivers are included p i 0 and the dependent variables are the two adaptation strategies the use of dtvs and irrigation the coefficients of the ap i variable are not statistically significant additionally weak instrument tests using f statistics reject the null hypothesis of a weak instrument 2 2 2 relationship between the use of dtvs and irrigation the analysis of the relationship between ex ante and ex post adaptations can yield useful policy advice if dtvs and irrigation were substitutes in preventing mitigating the negative impacts associated with droughts policymakers could focus on just one instead of both strategies for example in areas with scarce water resources the use of dtvs may be preferred due to the additional benefit of water conservation for farmers without access to irrigation planting dtvs also has the advantage of not requiring a high upfront fixed investment unlike the development of new irrigation facilities the relationships between dtvs and irrigation can be assessed by examining if the decision to use one strategy is influenced by the use of another strategy however the use of one strategy is likely to be endogenous in the regression on the decision to use another strategy this may be the case even when we examine the influence of an ex ante strategy on an ex post strategy although the use of dtvs precedes the irrigation decision temporally it may still be an endogenous variable this can happen due to the omission of factors such as past exposures to droughts that can influence both decisions a valid instrumental variable iv would only affect farmers decisions to use dtvs the usage rate of dtvs among other farmers in the same village is employed to instrument for a farmer s dtv use this is likely to be influenced by peers affected by peers adoption of dtvs a farmer may have a similar adoption decision to dtvs before seeding maize hereafter the farmer s dtvs adoption situation further influences the decision to irrigation during the growing season of maize the results of falsification tests valid this proposed iv empirically too two models are used namely a probit model where the dependent variable is a dummy variable that indicates a plot is irrigated and dtv use is an explanatory variable and the espm in the first stage a selection equation is run with dtv use as the dependent variable in the second stage an endogenous switching model is employed to model dtv use impact on irrigation decisions where farmers face two regimes using or not using dtvs 3 results and discussion 3 1 descriptive statistics although some studies predict the changes in drought severity duration and frequency in china e g leng et al 2015 there is no consensus on this among the sample farmers most farmers 71 perceive increasing drought severity table a 2 in appendices a sample data also reveal a sharp difference in the use rates of the two adaptation strategies with dtvs being used on 26 8 of the plots irrigation is more widely used about 76 of the plots have access to irrigation of which about 79 were irrigated during the survey years table a 4 in appendices a shows that the difference in shares of maize plots with dtvs in normal and drought years 26 8 and 26 4 respectively is not statistically significant the same is the case when farmers are divided into perceivers and non perceivers these observations offer support for treating dtvs use as an ex ante adaptation strategy the decision is typically made before farmers observe the actual weather conditions during the growing season and thus is less correlated with the occurrence of droughts in contrast dtv use seems to be positively correlated with perceptions of increasing drought severity in normal years dtvs are used on 29 2 and 21 5 of plots among farmers that perceive increasing drought severity and those that perceive the same or declining drought severity respectively the 7 7 difference is statistically significant at 1 in drought years the same pattern is observed the use rate is 8 higher among perceivers and the difference is statistically significant at 1 unlike dtv use irrigation use varies with weather conditions among all maize plots with access to irrigation the share of irrigated plots is 3 higher in drought years the difference is statistically significant at the 10 level and provides some support for treating irrigation as an ex post adaptation to drought in maize production non perceivers are more likely to use irrigation as an ex post adaptive strategy among perceivers the shares of irrigated plots do not differ much between normal and drought years the share of irrigated plots among non perceivers is 8 4 higher in drought years than normal years the difference is statistically significant at 1 level the decisions regarding ex post and ex ante adaptations might be correlated in both normal and drought years dtv non users irrigated a larger share of their plots than users the difference however is only statistically significant in normal years and can be mostly attributed to farmers significantly cutting back irrigation on plots with dtvs in normal years among plots without dtvs the irrigated share is only 1 8 lower in normal years than drought years and the difference is not statistically significant in contrast among plots with dtvs the irrigated share is 7 2 lower and the difference is statistically significant at 5 these observations also indicate that the effects of the ex ante dtv use and maybe other ex ante strategies on the ex post irrigation use work mostly to reduce irrigation this is probably because in areas with severe water shortages such as north china farmers often do not have the option to increase irrigation even in normal years 3 2 estimation results 3 2 1 farmers drought severity perceptions and the use of dtvs table 1 reports the estimation results of the models for dtv use the results of estimating espm with fiml are reported in columns 2 4 corresponding to eqs 2 1 2 2a and 2 2b for both the probit model and espm the wald χ 2 test statistic is statistically significant and different from zero suggesting the joint significance of all explanatory variables the test results justify the use of espm the wald χ 2 test of independent equations rejects the null hypothesis of the joint independence of eqs 2 1 2 2a and 2 2b thus the use of espm with fiml is more efficient than estimating the equations separately in particular the estimated correlation between the errors of eqs 2 1 and 2 2a ρ 1 is statistically significant and is 0 439 in magnitude this provides empirical evidence of a sample selectivity bias as drought severity perception and dtv use decisions are correlated at least among perceivers estimation should thus account for such endogenous switching column 2 in table 1 reports the estimation results for the impact on farmers perceptions denoted in eq 2 1 the results show a strong influence of peer perceptions on a farmer s drought severity perception the iv coefficient which is the average of the other farmers perceptions in the same village is positive and statistically significant at 1 it is also the largest compared to coefficients of other explanatory variables several farm and farmer characteristics also shape farmers drought severity perceptions having loam soil reduces the likelihood of increasing drought severity perceptions because better soil reduces the negative impacts of past droughts older farmers are less likely to perceive increasing drought severity education has the opposite effect on perception younger and more educated farmers may be more informed and aware of the notion of climate change and thus pay more attention to changes in drought severity farmers in larger families are more likely to perceive increasing drought severity as the coefficient measures the effect of one additional member and is not large the practical impact of family size on perceptions is unlikely to be large farm size is positively correlated with farmers increasing drought severity perception this may be because larger farms are more exposed to variations in weather conditions and experience larger negative impacts of weather shocks thus any changes in weather conditions may be more evident to farmers with larger farms the family members share with off farm work is negatively correlated with farmers increasing drought severity perception off farm employment may reduce the likelihood of increasing drought severity perception in several ways it may divert farmers attention away from their farms income from off farm work can also offset some of the negative drought impacts one surprising result is that drought mitigation support does not seem to influence farmers perception perhaps providing information about climate change is not part of the extension services currently offered in rural china the results of factors that may drive dtv use justify the use of an endogenous switching model table 1 columns 3 and 4 the signs magnitudes and or levels of statistical significance of the coefficients of many explanatory variables differ between perceivers and non perceivers the biggest differences lie in the effects of gender farm size and the availability of drought mitigation support the coefficients of these variables are small and not statistically significant among perceivers but much larger and statistically significant among non perceivers increasing drought severity perception makes male and female farmers equally likely to use dtvs it also makes farmers with larger or smaller farms equally likely to use dtvs farmers are likely to use dtvs regardless of the availability of drought mitigation support in contrast among non perceivers male farmers farmers with larger farms and farmers in villages with drought mitigation support are more likely than others to use dtvs another difference is the effect of the irrigable land share in the village its coefficient is positive among perceivers but negative among non perceivers the difference in the coefficients is large and statistically significant non perceivers in villages with better irrigation conditions are less likely to use dtvs which makes sense the positive correlation between better irrigation conditions and dtv use among perceivers is difficult to interpret and requires further investigation the results confirm the existence of heterogeneity between perceivers and non perceivers in the sample households and reveal the interactive effects between drought severity perception and other explanatory variables the estimation results of the espm are employed to perform a counterfactual analysis to quantify the impacts of farmers drought severity perception on the dtv use likelihood the att reported in table 2 shows that among perceivers the treatment of perceiving increasing drought severity increases the probability of using dtvs by 8 1 if perceivers did not perceive increasing drought severity their likelihood of using dtvs would be lower by 8 1 as currently dtvs are used on only 26 8 of sample plots an impact of 8 1 is large and practically important table 2 also reports the effects of perceiving increasing drought severity on dtv use by sample subgroups the results suggest that the effect is stronger on plots without access to irrigation the atts for increasing drought severity perception show a 9 8 and 7 5 increase in the probability of dtv use on plots without and with access to irrigation respectively plots without irrigation would incur much bigger yield losses if droughts occurred therefore increasing drought severity perception is more likely to induce farmers actions on such plots the atts do not differ much between normal and drought years 8 2 versus 8 0 providing further evidence that farmers use dtvs as an ex ante adaptation strategy the atts do vary with farm size sample farmers are divided into three equal portions based on farm size on farms where per capita land holdings are above 0 2 ha person top 33 farmers increasing drought severity perceptions increase the likelihood of dtv use by 22 5 on medium size farms where per capita land holdings range from 0 09 to 0 2 ha person middle 33 the att is still positive but much smaller 3 1 no effect is observed on small farms where per capita land holdings are below 0 09 ha person bottom 33 as droughts would have bigger impacts on larger farms increasing drought severity perception is more likely to induce farmers with larger farms to act the atts of increasing drought severity perceptions are lower in villages with drought mitigation support than those without such support 6 8 versus 14 9 this indicates that the availability of drought mitigation support muffles the effects of increasing drought severity perceptions on dtv use one possible explanation is that drought related extension services might be focusing more on post disaster assistance than educating farmers about climate change and offering support to establish proactive measures finally the positive effects of increasing drought severity perceptions on dtv use are larger on plots further away from home the plots are divided into three equal portions based on their distance to farmers houses the atts of increasing drought severity perception on plots more than 1 km away top 33 are almost twice that of plots closer by one explanation is that it is more time consuming to monitor the conditions of plots further away to assess irrigation needs using dtvs on those plots generate larger benefits in terms of labour time saved 3 2 2 farmers drought severity perceptions and irrigation table 3 reports the estimation results of espm for irrigation use on maize plots only plots with access to irrigation are included in the analysis the wald χ 2 test statistic of the model is statistically significant and different from zero indicating the joint significance of all explanatory variables however the wald χ 2 test of independent equations fails to reject the null hypothesis of the joint independence of the equations neither of the two estimated correlations between equations ρ 0 and ρ 1 is statistically significant suggesting that the hypothesis of no selection bias for farmers drought severity perception in explaining irrigation cannot be rejected therefore although espm use is valid it does not necessarily increase estimation efficiency relative to an approach that estimates eqs 2 1 2 2a and 2 2b separately most estimates of parameters in the selection eq 2 1 for the espm for irrigation table 3 column 1 are consistent with those for dtv use table 1 column 2 one interesting difference is the coefficient of the irrigable land share in the village is negative and statistically significant in table 3 but not in table 1 this means that irrigation conditions only shape drought severity perceptions for plots that have access to irrigation better irrigation conditions reduce the likelihood of perceiving increasing drought severity perhaps because irrigable plots in villages with better irrigation conditions are more sheltered from the negative drought impacts there are fewer differences in the coefficients of irrigation equations between perceivers and non perceivers table 3 columns 2 and 3 than those observed for dtv equations reported in table 1 for both perceivers and non perceivers farmers are more likely to irrigate loam and clay plots instead of sandy plots probably due to higher percolation rates on sandy plots for both groups the distance from a plot to a farmer s house is positively correlated with the probability of irrigation one significant difference lies in the gender effect among non perceivers a male household head increases the irrigation likelihood while no correlation is observed between gender and irrigation among perceivers the same difference is observed in table 1 another significant difference is while current weather conditions do not affect the irrigation likelihood among perceivers drought occurrence increases irrigation among non perceivers the coefficient of the dummy indicating a drought year is negative and statistically significant in the equation for non perceivers this difference is consistent with the observation from table a 4 in appendices a that non perceivers are more likely than perceivers to use irrigation as an ex post adaptive strategy table 4 reports the atts of perceiving increasing drought severity on irrigation overall increasing the drought severity perception reduces irrigation probability by 15 1 the negative effect is slightly stronger in drought years than normal years and is smaller on small farms than medium and large farms subgroups by the availability of drought mitigation support present the largest differences in atts the negative effect of perceiving increasing drought severity in villages that do not have drought mitigation support is more than twice the other villages the differences in atts among plots with varying distances to farmers houses are not statistically significant 3 2 3 relationship between dtv use and irrigation table 5 reports the estimation results of several models used to explore the dtv irrigation decision relationship columns 1 and 2 are both probit models where irrigation is the outcome and dtv use is added as an explanatory variable in column 2 the average drought severity perception of other farmers in the same village is used to instrument for a farmer s perception although the coefficient of perception is positive and statistically significant in the simple probit model column 1 in the iv probit model column 2 its magnitude drops to nearly zero and the statistical significance is lost therefore it is most likely that after the use of dtvs is controlled for drought severity perception does not have additional predictive powers for variations in irrigation decisions this is because that irrigation is more likely to be used as an ex post adaptation strategy irrigation decisions are made contingent on field and weather conditions during the growing season not on perceptions formed before the growing season in both columns 1 and 2 the coefficients of the variable indicating dtv use are negative and statistically significant pointing to a negative correlation between dtv use and irrigation on maize plots the espm with fiml estimation is presented in columns 3 5 column 3 is the selection equation for dtv use columns 4 and 5 are the switching equations on irrigation for dtv users and non users perception is not included because it does not seem to have predictive powers once dtv use is controlled for the share of other farmers in the same village that used dtvs is used to instrument for a farmer s dtv use the coefficient of the iv is positive and statistically significant at 1 table a 5 in appendices a the results of espm in columns 3 5 could be further used to conduct a counterfactual analysis of the impact of dtv use on irrigation table 6 reports the atts computed from the estimation results of the espm the direction of the atts is consistent with that in the simple probit model the treatment of using dtvs decreases the probability of irrigation by 27 5 according to the results in table 2 4 6 together the relationships among drought severity perception dtv use and irrigation can be summarised as follows perceiving increasing drought severity increases dtv use likelihood and reduces irrigation likelihood in maize production further it is likely that the negative effect of perception on irrigation mainly works through the negative correlation between using dtvs and irrigation table 6 also reports the atts of using dtvs on irrigation by sample subgroups the results suggest the negative effect is stronger in normal years than in drought years 25 3 versus 29 6 reduction irrigation likelihood this is consistent with the observation in table a 4 in appendices a that dtv non users irrigate a larger share of their plots than users but the difference is statistically significant only in normal years this finding may be more important for areas that use groundwater less water use in normal years means more water would be available in aquifers during drought years the negative effect dtv use on irrigation is stronger on large farms than on medium or small farms the atts do not differ much between villages with and without drought mitigation support and are larger in magnitudes on plots further away from farmers houses 3 3 robustness check to confirm the stability of the main findings of this study we further conduct a set of robustness checks as follows first we re estimate the impacts of drought perception on using dtvs and irrigation by adjusting samples considering the geographic distribution of sample provinces in this study all provinces are located in northern china in addition to jiangsu province thus we drop the samples from jiangsu and re estimate the empirical models as shown in table a 6 in appendices a for the samples from all northern provinces the impact of drought perception on dtvs use gets smaller than that of previous results while both drought perception and dtvs use have more negative impacts on irrigation than before hence although the magnitudes of atts changed their significances and impact directions are completely same with our main results these results not only confirm the stability of the main findings but also imply heterogeneous effects of farmers drought perceptions on adaptation strategies in different regions second the impact of increasing drought severity perceptions on dtvs use is re estimated by employing the two steps and control function approach table a 6 in appendices a the marginal effect of drought perception on dtvs use is significantly positive consistent with the att of main results however the combination approach of two steps and control function cannot control for the potential selection bias accordingly here the marginal effect of increasing drought severity perceptions on dtvs use is over estimated third the irrigation model is re estimated by using a variable of irrigation count whilst the endogenous treatment poisson regression is further employed as shown in table a 6 in appendices a the atts of drought perception and dtvs use on irrigation count are both significantly negative the results are in line with the main results and further confirm that perceiving increasing drought severity and using dtvs can reduce the use of irrigation 4 conclusions in response to drought maize farmers in north china may have both ex ante and ex post adaptations while this study focuses on two adaptation strategies the ex ante adoption of dtvs and the ex post use of irrigation farmers perception of increasing drought severity can increase the probability of using dtvs by 8 1 and lower the probability of irrigation by 15 1 on maize plots however once dtv use is controlled for perception does not seem to have additional predictive powers for irrigation implying that irrigation decisions are made not on perceptions formed before the growing season instead dtv use reduces the probability of irrigation by 27 5 confirming that dtv use is effective for saving irrigation water this study contributes to the existing literature of the impacts of farmers perceptions on their adaptation to climate change as shown in most studies abid et al 2020 brüssow et al 2019 dang et al 2019 farmers who perceived climate change are more likely to take adaption actions our study provides additional evidence for the positive linkage between perceptions and adaptation behaviour moreover this study distinguished ex ante and ex post adaptations and found out perceptions may have different impacts on different types of adaptation measures similar to our results brüssow et al 2019 found that farmers in tanzania who perceived climate change are more likely to take short term adaptations rather than investment intensive method such as building irrigation system hou et al 2017 found that farmers perceiving increasing drought are more likely to adopt water saving technologies but they did not distinguish ex ante and ex post adaptations this paper also advanced the literature by setting up a conceptual framework to describe the linkages between perceptions and different types of adaptation measures few existing studies presented theoretical models the findings of this study have three policy implications first the positive effect of perceiving increasing drought severity on dtv use suggested that policy makers can improve adoption of dtv through increasing farmers perceptions of climate change less than 30 of our sample plot used dtvs indicating large scope for boosting its use second our results also suggest that several channels that could improve farmers perceptions for example educating influential farmers in the village about the changes in weather conditions would pay off as our results show that peer perceptions matter another example interventions that target large farms may be more effective third the linkage between ex ante and ex post adaptation measures suggest that it is of great important to distinguish types of adaptation measures as limited adaptation resources could be allocated efficiently in our example dtvs can reduce use of irrigation water this has significant policy implications especially for the areas with severe water shortage moreover in those areas targeting larger farms and villages where land is distributed more sparsely and further away from farmers houses to promote dtvs may achieve a larger reduction in irrigation water use under the constraint of water resource the water saving by using dtvs actually has huge external positive effect on the sustainability of economic social development and environment finally we call for further study on evaluating the optimal strategy mix i e how to allocate adaptation funding and efforts among different types of adaptation measures in our sample almost 80 of irrigable sample plots are irrigated while less than 30 use ex ante adaptations such as dtvs if ex ante adaptations can better hedge farmers against weather risks at lower costs compared to those of ex post adaptations more extension efforts and financial resources should be allocated towards ex ante adaptations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

erdlenbruch 2012 lehmann n and finger 2014 and jianjun et al 2015 this study develops a conceptual model to capture the impacts of farmers drought severity perceptions on their ex ante and ex post adaptations based on the expected utility model in practice farmers have many adaptation strategies to drought risks for instance adopting new technology planting new crop varieties purchasing crop insurance crop diversification investing in irrigation infrastructure jianjun et al 2015 this study focuses on the use of drought tolerant varieties and irrigation as they are the most direct related measures with water the study on these two strategies helps better understand the design of agricultural water saving strategies under drought risks thus the use of drought tolerant varieties dtvs of maize is treated as an ex ante adaptation as this decision is made before the start of the growing season and is ex ante relative to the drought occurring in the growing season in contrast irrigation is an ex post adaptation to drought because the irrigation decision is made according to actual weather conditions sufficient precipitation could ensure maize is completely rain fed without the need for irrigation if a drought occurs then farmers will decide whether to irrigate thus in maize production irrigation decisions can be treated as an ex post adaptation to drought hence the conceptual model can be established through two stages the ex ante choice of maize variety in the first stage a decision model on dtv adoption in maize farming is developed based on the expected utility model and the household model of agricultural production the expected utility u i is assumed to be determined by the profit of the maize farming at the i th plot and its maximisation problem can be written as follows b 1 max u i max y i c k i f y i d y s t y i y k i l i i i i 1 2 k i 1 where l i represents the planting area of maize farming at the i th plot available to the farmer while i i denotes the irrigation condition of the i th plot the vector k i k i 1 k i 2 where k i 1 and k i 2 are dummy variables representing the variety use of the i th plot k i 1 1 denotes dtv k i 2 1 denotes conventional variety y i is a vector of outputs corresponding to k i given the planting area of maize l i and the irrigation condition i i of the i th plot while c k i is the cost function corresponding to k i in addition to the used variety k i the cost function c k i also depends on the variable inputs and the corresponding prices f y is the farmer s subjective probability density function for y i which is assumed to be solely related to the weather conditions w t in the coming crop season bai et al 2015 we assume that all maize farmers in the same location face the same market prices of maize maize varieties and inputs in the observation year according to our observations as no significant differences exist in the market prices of dtvs and conventional varieties the price variables are omitted in the utility function 1 as farmers do not know the weather conditions in the coming crop season w t they make the decision on x based on their prediction of the weather conditions here we assume that farmers prediction of weather conditions in the coming crop season w t ˆ can be expressed as b 2 w t ˆ g w t p where w t denotes the real weather conditions in previous years while p represents farmers perceptions of the weather condition change in previous years by incorporating the weather condition prediction function b 2 into the maximisation problem b 1 the optimal variety choice x it of the i th plot can be conceptually derived as b 3 x it z w t p c l i i i where the real weather conditions in previous years w t could be omitted as there is an implicit assumption that all farmers in the same location g faced the same weather conditions in previous years given this study s focus on drought adaptations the perception of a change in weather conditions p here is proxied by the drought severity perception p the optimal variety choice of the i th plot for using dtv can then be simplified as b 4 k i 1 z p c l i i i g where k i 1 1 indicates that the maize farmer adopts dtv at the i th plot otherwise 0 the formula b 4 reveals that the ex ante choice of using dtv on the i th plot depends on farmers perceptions of drought severity the input costs c of dtv and conventional variety the plot area l irrigation condition i and the location g of the i th plot the ex post choice of irrigation in the second stage the decision on irrigation is made according to the previous decision of dtv adoption and actual weather conditions hence in this stage the expected utility maximisation u i of the maize farming of the i th plot can be modified as b 5 max u i max y i c k i 1 i i g y i d y s t y i y k i 1 i i l i i i m 1 2 i im 1 where i i 1 and i i 2 are dummy variables representing the irrigation decision of the i th plot i i 1 1 denotes irrigate i i 2 1 denotes do not irrigate that constitute i i i i 1 i i 2 y i is a vector of outputs corresponding to k i 1 and i i given the area l i and irrigation condition i i of the i th plot c k i 1 i i is the cost function corresponding to k i 1 and i i the farmer s subjective probability density function g y is assumed to be related to weather conditions w t which includes both the actual weather conditions prevailing in the crop growing season w t 1 and the prediction in the coming crop season w t ˆ the optimal choice of i could thus be conceptually expressed as b 6 i t l w t w t 1 p c k i 1 l i i i where both the weather conditions in previous years w t and the actual weather conditions occurring in the crop growing season w t could be neglected by assuming weather conditions remain unchanged at the same location g the irrigation decision on the i th plot can be obtained and written as a function b 7 by incorporating the function b 4 into the function b 6 b 7 i i 1 l p c c l i i i g hence the drought severity perceptions determine the ex post irrigation decision of the i th plot also the ex post irrigation decision is affected by the input costs of maize farming using dtv and conventional variety at the i th plot c the input costs of irrigation at the i th plot c the planting area l i and irrigation condition of the i th plot i i and the location g 
9072,crop stress indicators can serve as a basis for demand oriented irrigation management canopy temperature based algorithms in combination with nondestructive infrared thermometer measurements are widely used mainly in arid regions due to the impact of climate change on agricultural production canopy temperature based indices are increasingly applied in humid areas of central europe this requires an evaluation of the algorithms under local environmental conditions the objective of this study was to assess the crop water stress index cwsi and the degrees above canopy threshold dact as irrigation scheduling methods in a subhumid agricultural area in austria the study was performed in 2018 and 2019 on a soybean field that was divided into four plots under different water management conditions one of the plots was irrigated by means of sprinklers si plot another one by drip lines di plot and a third one by a hose reel boom bi plot the fourth plot ni was rainfed to be able to relate crop water status to soil water status soil matric potential ψ m was monitored at 20 40 and 60 cm depths both cwsi and dact reflected the different plant water conditions accordingly the highest stress levels were found in the ni plot followed by the si di and bi plots the interpretation of the indices regarding cloudy skies was improved by using the maximum cwsi and dact observed between 1000 h and 1600 h overall the plots with lower seasonal mean indices produced larger yields and vice versa the ψ m correlation results suggested that under severe stress a better representation of soil water availability down to 60 cm can be obtained when using the dact compared to the cwsi the dact was considered a more practical alternative than the cwsi since it requires less effort and proved to be equally effective abbreviations bi plot irrigated with boom system cc canopy cover in cwsi crop water stress index dact degrees above canopy threshold in c dap days after

degrees above canopy threshold irrigation systems yield soil matric potential data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction agriculture is likely to suffer from different levels of water scarcity in many parts of the world due to climate change cai et al 2015 consequently crop yields are projected to have positive or negative impacts depending on regional conditions such as temperature changes and co2 levels rosenzweig et al 2014 in addition irrigation requirements are expected to increase in most agricultural areas of the northern hemisphere mainly due to summer precipitation reduction döll 2002 these climate change impacts on agriculture directly affect food security ainsworth and ort 2010 soybean is a major protein crop whose cultivation has recently increased in europe with austria among the top ten production countries of the continent fogelberg and recknagel 2017 however considerable soybean yield reductions due to summer droughts have been reported in austria over the past decade although the cultivation area of soybean has increased statistik austria 2018 therefore improvements in irrigation scheduling techniques are recommended to stabilize soybean production and to preserve water resources irrigation scheduling for example can be based on crop water status monitoring the crop water status indicates the current condition from sufficiently watered to severely stressed therefore it gives good information on when to irrigate crop water stress can be detected for example by an increase in canopy temperature tc in this context infrared radiometers irts are increasingly used as a nondestructive method to monitor tc the measured data are usually converted into standardized indices to make the application more practical tc based indices can be used as decision support algorithms for irrigation scheduling for instance the crop water stress index cwsi developed by idso et al 1981 is a widely used method several authors have established cwsi thresholds with respect to the optimization of irrigation scheduling nielsen 1990 o shaughnessy et al 2012 erdem et al 2010 osroosh et al 2015 the cwsi is based on the difference between air and canopy temperature which generally increases when water stress occurs in addition to these temperature data upper and lower limits are needed to relate the temperature differences to the prevailing environmental conditions the cwsi can be calculated using either an empirical or a theoretical approach in the empirical approach the canopy air temperature differentials dtm are normalized between lower dtll and upper dtul limits as a function of vapor pressure deficit vpd both limits should be defined for specific crop and climatic conditions according to baker et al 2013 the cwsi is characterized by daily fluctuations resulting from the sensitivity of the index to changing meteorological conditions including vapor pressure deficit vpd additionally dejonge et al 2015 and pramanik et al 2017 stated that the need for continuous on site monitoring of micrometeorological variables such as relative humidity and air temperature to calculate vpd limits the practical use of the cwsi as an irrigation decision support algorithm therefore alternative procedures to quantify water stress in crops have been suggested that can be easily adopted by smallholder water managers for instance dejonge et al 2015 proposed the degrees above canopy threshold dact which appears to be a practical alternative because it requires only tc measurements consequently the dact can be calculated with less monitoring and computational effort than the cwsi however the applicability of the dact requires evaluation for crops and climatic conditions different from those presented by dejonge et al 2015 limited use of tc based indices such as cwsi and dact has been suggested for humid environments where low vpd and cloudy skies are prevalent the reasons are that low vpd affects dtll definition and cloudy conditions make the irt sensors less responsive to crop water status jensen et al 1990 precipitation distribution is another factor that strongly influences cwsi dynamics in humid environments especially with respect to setting irrigation thresholds lena et al 2020 however studies that evaluated the cwsi method as an irrigation scheduling algorithm in humid bockhold et al 2011 humid to subtropical kar and kumar 2010 lena et al 2020 and subhumid climates candogan et al 2013 have shown promising results regarding dact there are no studies that address its performance in a subhumid climate there is also a lack of studies comparing the effects of different irrigation systems on the cwsi and dact under realistic conditions therefore research is needed to contribute to a better understanding of tc based indices as irrigation scheduling tools in subhumid regions in addition to crop water status soil water status can also be used for irrigation scheduling the soil water status can be expressed as matric potential indicating the availability of soil water for crop uptake knowing the soil water status helps in planning irrigation events with respect to time and amount although crop and soil water stress are interrelated the interactions need to be studied in detail because they are based on complex processes within the soilplant atmosphere continuum spac erdem et al 2010 stated that crop water stress measurements should be calibrated with a reliable soil water status indicator to be used as a complement in irrigation scheduling however dejonge et al 2015 and mohamed et al 2019 presented rather low r2 values after correlating cwsi and dact to soil water status indicators low correlations between cwsi and indicators of soil status in the root system can be attributed to the sensitivity of the index to weather fluctuations chen et al 2010 in this context studies of the relationships between plant water stress indices and soil water status at different rooting depths would be interesting this could lead to an improvement in irrigation scheduling by combining and using the different indicators in the best possible way the objective of this study was to assess the cwsi and dact methods on soybeans growing in a subhumid area under different water management conditions the assessment was carried out with respect to 1 meteorological conditions and irrigation 2 yield reduction and irrigation thresholds and 3 matric potential measured at different depths a complementary objective was to develop the lower and upper cwsi limits for implementing this method in a subhumid region 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiments were conducted during the summers of 2018 and 2019 at the agricultural school in obersiebenbrunn landwirtschaftliche fachschule lfs in lower austria 48 15 49 8 n 16 42 01 7 e elevation 151 m the climate in the region is subhumid the average annual precipitation p and air temperature ta between 1990 and 2019 were 550 mm and 11 c respectively according to data from the zentralanstalt für meteorologie und geodynamik zamg the average p ta and relative humidity rh during the summer months are shown in table 1 for the long term data series 1990 2019 and the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons the soil between 0 and 15 cm depth was classified as sandy silt whereas that between 15 and 60 cm was classified as sandy loam the soil from 60 to 120 cm depth was loamy sand classification was made according to the austrian texture triangle classification önorm l 1050 fig 1 shows water retention curves fitted using the retc program van genuchten et al 1991 after analyzing undisturbed soil samples 200 cm3 in a pressure plate apparatus ppa the soil samples were collected at 20 40 and 60 cm depths the soybean varieties antonia mg 000 and lenka mg 00 were planted in 2018 and 2019 respectively soybeans in mg 000 and mg 00 differ in seeding rates with yields of 4 5 and 4 packages of 150 000 grains respectively in both years a precision seeder was used 80 grains m 2 with a row spacing of 50 cm and a seeding depth of 5 cm details of the crop growth stages according to fehr and caviness 1977 are listed in table 2 the crop stage lengths were determined based on field observations and supplementary crop information described in irrigation and drainage paper 66 from the food and agricultural organization fao steduto et al 2012 the development of the crop was homogeneous across the field similarly the maximum rooting depth was defined as 90 cm due to the difference in maturity group variant antonia in 2018 reached maturity earlier than lenka in 2019 2 2 irrigation management the experimental site had a total extension of 120 120 m2 and was divided into four rectangular plots three of which were irrigated and one of which was rainfed a monitoring station equipped with several sensors was installed at each plot in this area the prevailing wind directions are northwest and southeast dobesch and neuwirt 1982 schemes of the experimental site and surrounding area as well as the relative position of the plots are shown in fig 2 irrigation was provided by a boom sprinkler and drip system with sprinklers being the most commonly used in the agricultural areas of austria the irrigated plots were referred to as bi boom irrigation si sprinkler irrigation and di drip irrigation the rainfed plot was denoted as ni no irrigation the widths of the plots were 60 m 17 m 18 m and 25 m for bi si di and ni respectively fig 2b two multistage centrifugal pumps with 22 kw of power were used to pump the irrigation water with an operating pressure of 5 bar the boom system distributed the water by means of rotating nozzles with large intensity and covered a strip width of approximately 60 m model a50 röhren und pumpenwerk bauer gmbh austria it was mounted on a three wheeled machine that was supplied with water and moved across the field via a rotating hose reel in the sprinkler irrigated plot a total of seven metal impact sprinklers model 233b naandan jain irrigation ltd india that covered an 18 m radius were installed on quick coupling pipes the main difference between the boom and sprinkler systems was that the former applied water with higher intensity the driplines model stremaline x 16080 netafim ltd israel were installed with a lateral distance of 0 5 m and had drippers every 0 3 m with a flow rate of 0 7 l h 1 a plot harvester was used to obtain the yield the mean yields of the plots were calculated from four measurements made in each of the four plots each of the sixteen yield measurements were taken from an area of 15 m2 the irrigation events were scheduled by the farmers who work at the agricultural school based on their experience the irrigation decisions were supported by matric potential measurements of sensors installed at 20 cm depth the intended irrigation threshold was 100 kpa however under real conditions it was not achieved in all cases for example a variation of 20 kpa was observed in the bi and si plots and 40 kpa in the di plot the latter due to the heterogeneity of the water distribution by drippers the irrigation amounts were set in advance based on operational practices and the water holding capacity of the soil profile additionally the amounts were adapted to compensate different application efficiencies for example larger evaporation losses expected in the sprinkler irrigated plot on days when the three plots were irrigated the systems ran simultaneously the volume of water pumped was measured with a flowmeter and the irrigation amounts were calculated by relating them to the area it is noteworthy that all irrigated plots should generally represent an optimal irrigation treatment without water stress in humid and subhumid areas supplemental irrigation scheduling depends greatly on precipitation regimes fereres and soriano 2007 in this study precipitation p was measured at a weather station close to the experimental site the details about irrigation events and p are shown in table 3 due to the large number of small wetting events only those that were larger than 2 0 mm and occurred two weeks before the first irrigation and two weeks after the last irrigation are presented in this table the total p from planting to harvest was 272 mm in 2018 and 278 mm in 2019 p in 2019 was characterized by small and frequent events although similar total p amounts were registered in both seasons the events in 2019 were more evenly distributed 2 3 temperature and humidity measurements the monitoring stations collected data between 5 july and 19 september dap 70 146 in 2018 and 1 july until 30 september dap 54 145 in 2019 each monitoring station was equipped with an infrared radiometer irt si 411 apogee instruments inc u s a the irt sensors were installed at a height of 1 8 m and mounted with a view angle of 45 to measure canopy temperature tc within a standard target area of approximately 6 m2 22 half angle field of view the crops reached approximately 1 m in height after full development therefore tc was measured approximately 0 8 m above the canopy the irt sensors were calibrated by the manufacturer and the specific calibration coefficients were integrated into the sensors to obtain the corrected readings considering the effect of body temperature corrections for emissivity and background effects were also applied to all measurements following the approach presented in blonquist et al 2009 to obtain the target temperature ta and rh were measured at a weather station near the experimental site with a tr1 sensor adcon telemetry by ott hydromet gmbh austria installed at 2 m height the temporal resolution of the irt and tr1 measurements was 15 min the values were temporarily stored within remote terminal units and finally transmitted to a central server via a telemetry network approximately every hour the data were retrieved from the online platform adcon addvantage pro 6 6 due to a technical failure of the irt sensors in the di and bi plots tc measurements were interrupted on 9 september 2019 dap 123 in the di plot and were not possible at all during the entire 2019 measurement period in the bi plot 2 4 cwsi and dact the empirical crop water stress index cwsi idso et al 1981 jackson et al 1981 relates the difference between the measured canopy and air temperatures dtm to the lower dtll and upper dtul limits of those differentials the cwsi values range between 1 indicating full stress and 0 indicating no stress and were estimated as follows 1 cwsi dtm dtll dtul dtll to compute the cwsi according to eq 1 dtll was established by relating canopy air temperature differentials tc ta to vapor pressure deficit vpd using dtll m vpd b where m and b are the slope and intercept of the linear relationship respectively dtul was estimated as dtul m vpg b where vpg is the vapor pressure gradient the first step to assess the cwsi was to develop dtll for the specific conditions of this study temperature differentials tc ta and vpd were calculated for each plot rh and ta readings from tr1 were used to calculate vpd as the difference between saturated vapor pressure and actual vapor pressure following the procedure of allen et al 1998 days that represented well watered conditions were selected to develop dtll a method similar to that used by taghvaeian et al 2012 was used for the selection the selection criterion was that the data points tc ta vs vpd collected one day after major wetting events i e irrigation or precipitation followed the trend of a nonstressed crop as shown by idso et al 1981 and taghvaeian et al 2012 for such days dtm values represent the lower limit dtll because this method assumes that the soil water storage is replenished and the crops have access to sufficient soil water taghvaeian et al 2012 since cloud cover affects canopy temperature the cwsi empirical method is only valid under clear sky conditions therefore it was verified that the selected days for dtll had relative solar radiation rsr larger than 0 70 as suggested by taghvaeian et al 2012 rsr was calculated on a daily basis as the ratio of measured global radiation rs and calculated clear sky radiation rso rsr varies between approximately 0 33 dense cloud cover and 1 clear sky allen et al 1998 once dtll was developed vpg was calculated as the difference between saturated air vapor pressure at air temperature and saturated air vapor pressure at air temperature plus the coefficient b from the dtll equation dtul was estimated using the same slope and intercept developed for dtll taghvaeian et al 2014 finally the limits i e dtll and dtul were used in eq 1 along with corresponding dtm measurements to estimate the cwsi cwsi values smaller than zero and greater than one were set to zero and one respectively the degrees above canopy threshold dact was introduced by dejonge et al 2015 and quantifies the temperature difference above the critical temperature t critical for the crop the dact represented as an index was computed as follows dejonge et al 2015 2 dact h max 0 tc h t critical where tc is the canopy temperature of the crop at a given time h and t critical is the threshold temperature for the crop in this study a value of 28 c was used as t critical for soybeans under humid conditions according to bockhold et al 2011 dact from eq 2 gives a value of zero to indicate no stress assuming that the crop is not stressed if the canopy temperature is below t critical limited canopy cover incorporates background effects into tc measurements colaizzi et al 2012 therefore cwsi and dact were assessed for irt measurements collected over canopy cover cc greater than 80 as suggested by dejonge et al 2015 the assessment period for each season is indicated in table 4 the periods included the r1 flowering to r5 beginning of seed growth stages and ended when crop senescence started in 2019 in addition to irt data from reproductive stages the indices were also assessed for the irt data collected during the last days of the vegetative period between 1 july and 6 july even though tc measurements were affected by cc 80 this was done to evaluate the cwsi and dact response to the irrigation events on 4 july in the di and si plots four tc rh and vpd readings were collected every hour at 15 minute intervals thus the two indices i e cwsi and dact were calculated individually for all four replicates and then averaged to hourly values 2 5 soil matric potential measurements watermark granular matrix sensors irrometer co usa were connected to the monitoring stations to monitor the soil matric potential ψ m the measurements from the watermark sensors were obtained in each plot at 20 40 and 60 cm depths during both growing seasons the three sensors were installed approximately 30 cm apart from each other the measurements were collected with a storage interval of 15 min and were averaged to obtain daily values the data were retrieved from the online platform adcon addvantage pro 6 6 the calibration of watermark sensors was performed in a previous study by nolz et al 2013 the range of the watermark was from 0 to 200 kpa according to the manufacturer after the extrapolation of the calibration curve by nolz et al 2013 the measurement range increased to 0 630 kpa therefore matric potential values larger than 200 kpa might contain a larger uncertainty the watermark measurements used in this study correspond to absolute values of ψ m fig 3 depicts the matric potential evolution during the studied growing seasons of 2018 and 2019 at different depths 2 6 statistical analysis data processing and statistical analysis were conducted using microsoft excel r software r core team 2019 and the curveexpert basic program hyams 2017 a least square regression was performed to develop dtll using tc ta versus vpd data and to correlate dact versus matric potential measurements regressions between matric potential measurements and cwsi were performed in curveexpert basic hyams 2017 which uses the levenbergmarquardt method to solve nonlinear regressions the differences between the seasonal mean cwsi and dact from the four plots calculated for 2018 as well as for 2019 were tested using a wilcoxon pairedwise difference test 3 results and discussion 3 1 development of dtll and dtul for cwsi assessment the tc ta vs vpd data points for dtll development were selected following the method of taghvaeian et al 2012 in this study data points one day after wetting events did not always show the characteristic linear relationship shown by idso et al 1981 and taghvaeian et al 2012 therefore the selection was extended by identifying days that fulfilled the trend criterion the trend was observed for some days in the bi plot in 2018 and in the di plot in 2019 even though no major wetting event had taken place one day before it was concluded that the values from the selected days represented well watered crop conditions however no data points in si that represented well irrigated conditions were found probably due to water losses caused by wind drift and evaporation in total thirteen days were selected for dtll development fig 4 the linear segment between 1000 h and 1600 h was extracted from the daily curves resulting in 360 tc ta vs vpd data points the least square regression resulted in dtll 3 64 2 17 vpd fig 4 the r2 value of 0 74 is typical for dtll determined with data collected from different crop growing stages gardner et al 1992 the values of m and b presented in this study were smaller and larger respectively than what other authors reported nielsen 1990 determined dtll 2 51 2 02 vpd and the result of m was similar to the result presented here in contrast candogan et al 2013 elaborated dtll 0 65 1 85 vpd for soybeans in a subhumid climate in this study the data from two soybean varieties planted in two different seasons were used to develop dtll the reason for this was that the combined data showed the same linear trend fig 4 and highly similar coefficients not shown therefore it was concluded that the dtll developed with the combined data represented both soybean variants other studies have shown combinations of data to develop cwsi baselines for instance idso et al 1981 elaborated dtll 1 44 1 34 vpd for data collected over soybeans at widely spread locations in the usa the dtll result presented here was obtained for a rather narrow vpd range of 0 4 3 kpa which can lead to inaccuracies when calculating the cwsi jensen et al 1990 however adequate cwsi values resulting from narrow vpd ranges have often been reported for example vpd of 1 4 kpa taghvaeian et al 2012 candogan et al 2013 0 4 kpa payero and irmak 2006 and 0 5 2 1 kpa lebourgeois et al 2010 erdem et al 2010 it has been suggested that a vpd range of 1 6 kpa is required to define a dtll that could be used in many locations gardner and shock 1989 nevertheless for a certain dataset nielsen 1990 showed the invalidity of dtll suggested by idso et al 1981 although it was developed for a relatively wide vpd range of 0 6 kpa therefore the vpd range for the dtll definition depends not only on climatic conditions but also on management practices in this study dtll was determined for crops under typical management practices in the region the results of dtul calculated for all dtm values within the assessment period ranged between 4 0 and 6 6 c candogan et al 2013 and tekelioğlu et al 2017 found dtul 3 2 c and dtul 4 0 c respectively payero and irmak 2006 used a multiple regression analysis and obtained a dtul of 2 8 c calculated for rs 800 wm 2 and u2 2 0 ms 1 therefore a relatively large dtul was found in this study compared to what has been reported thus far for soybeans the differences between this study dtll and dtul results and other baselines were attributed to differences in climatic conditions soybean varieties and management practices therefore their use in future investigations would require similar conditions to those of the present study 3 2 assessment of cwsi and dact with respect to meteorological conditions and irrigation events hourly mean cwsi and dact were calculated for the two seasons for the assessment periods indicated in table 4 the hourly intervals considered were between 1000 h and 1600 h this interval was chosen to avoid false increases in tc that might occur in the early morning or late afternoon when low radiation might cause partial stomata closure wanjura and upchurch 1997 according to taghvaeian et al 2012 data collection time is important when implementing the cwsi they suggested that the hourly interval at which the maximum seasonal mean cwsi is estimated should be used as the time of the day to monitor the cwsi as an irrigation scheduling tool in this study the basic trend of reaching a peak value at mid day hours and decreasing during the afternoon was observed in both indices in all plots however the maximum seasonal mean value of the indices was observed at different hourly intervals between 1000 h and 1600 h depending on the index and the plot in 2018 the maximum mean cwsi was found at the hourly intervals of 1000 1100 h in the bi plot 1100 1200 h in the si and ni plots and 1300 1400 h in the di plot in the same year the maximum mean dact was found at 1400 1300 h in the bi si and ni plots while in the di plot it was observed at 1300 1400 h in 2019 both indices maximum mean values were obtained a few hours later compared to 2018 maximum mean cwsi and dact in the di and ni plots were found at 1400 1300 h however in the si plot maximum mean cwsi and dact were observed at 1500 1600 h therefore the time of the day at which maximum mean index values were measured was subject to irrigation water management and precipitation distribution furthermore the different soybean responses to water stress between the two seasons could have been influenced by the difference in soybean varieties the variability of the hourly interval at which maximum seasonal mean indices occurred produced uncertainties regarding the selection of the daily value additionally the influence of cloudiness on irt measurements during some days produced a reduction in the indices at different hourly intervals on such days the indices often increased later in the day depicting a more representative value of crop stress discussed later to adapt the methods to the conditions of this study and to obtain a reliable representation of the crop stress levels daily cwsi and dact were selected by identifying the maximum value as an hourly mean that occurred between 1000 h and 1600 h for each day within the assessment period the variations in the stress indices during the 2018 and 2019 seasons are illustrated in fig 5 and fig 6 respectively the cwsi changes in 2018 are shown in fig 5a the cwsi decreased in the bi and si plots on irrigation days however cwsi in the di plot did not show a decrease on irrigation days except for the event on 31 july the dact values in 2018 fig 5b were 0 c or slightly larger than 0 c after the first two irrigation events in the three irrigated plots during the third irrigation event on 9 august dact in the si and di plots remained relatively large i e 5 c whereas it decreased in the bi this result can be attributed to the higher levels of crop stress accumulated over previous days in the si and di plots compared to the bi plots the indices in the ni plot showed less variability than those in the irrigated plots with longer periods of increased values and marked reductions on rainy days an increase in both indices was observed in the si and ni plots at the end of the assessment period and the latter even showed cwsi values greater than 1 equal to 1 in fig 5a this was due to cumulative stress which induced early senescence in the crops in the si and ni plots variations in the cwsi in 2019 are shown in fig 6a generally cwsi values in the di plot were smaller on irrigation days and on the days following irrigation compared to the si plot the irrigation in the si plot on 2 august produced a value of cwsi 0 equal to 0 in fig 6a while after the irrigation event on 22 july the cwsi was not reduced and remained almost constant 0 5 two days later the cwsi in 2019 showed more pronounced peaks in both the high and low ranges compared to the 2018 results especially in the ni plot additionally a decreasing trend of the cwsi was observed in the three plots from the start to the end of the assessment period this can be attributed to the frequent small p events that occurred in 2019 which prevented the increase in the cwsi over long periods a larger cwsi decrease after rainfall was observed in the ni plot than in the other plots this behavior was also observed in mildly stressed crops in the study by lena et al 2020 when cwsi 0 4 before a wetting event the dact changes in 2019 are shown in fig 6b on irrigation days dact values smaller than 5 c were observed a clear increase in dact was observed between 23 and 26 july in all plots due to the absence of wetting events in the first half of the assessment period dact values in the ni plot were larger than those in the other plots after 19 july the dact values were similar to those in the si plot until the end of the period this similarity between the ni and si suggests that the crops in the si plot suffered from stress levels comparable to those in the ni plot both indices showed large values between 1 and 6 july because of incomplete cc for instance cwsi 1 in the ni plot on 1 and 3 july equal to 1 in fig 6a taghvaeian et al 2012 and dejonge et al 2015 suggested that rsr values greater than 0 7 and 0 8 respectively represented suitable clear sky solar radiation conditions for the validity of tc based stress indices in this study days without clear sky conditions i e cloudy days in terms of rsr were rather frequent rsr 0 7 occurred on 34 and 40 of the days in 2018 and 2019 respectively cloudy conditions were usually observed when precipitation occurred these cloudy conditions produced low peaks that introduced uncertainties in the interpretation of the indices in an attempt to overcome this limitation the maximum cwsi and dact values occurring on a day were selected as daily stress indices however the reduction of the indices was still observed on some of the days in 2018 the combined effect of precipitation and cloudy skies was observed as the indices decreased on 6 and 10 july and 10 and 14 august fig 5 in 2019 this effect was observed on 12 and 13 july fig 6 the indices also decreased on days without p but with rsr 0 7 for example in 2019 on 7 and 21 july and 14 august fig 6 in the si plot rsr values of 0 33 on 27 july and 0 40 on 2 august 2019 the latter combined with an irrigation event produced cwsi 0 equal to 0 on fig 6a an rsr value of 0 36 on 21 august resulted in cwsi 0 in all plots equal to 0 in fig 6a in this study the effect of clouds was easier to detect and interpret in the dact results since this index showed values of 0 c on most days with rsr 0 7 the effect of cloudy skies on the cwsi method was also observed in preliminary results from a study conducted under similar climatic conditions in germany anter and kraft 2018 cloudy conditions are quite frequent in humid areas therefore more research should be conducted to investigate the relative solar radiation rsr value at which a significant reduction in irt measurements starts and thus propose a lower rsr threshold for these climates the dynamics of the indices showed that they generally decreased during wetting events and decreased as water was depleted due to crop evapotranspiration in addition the indices were found to be highly responsive under severe stress conditions i e ni plot 3 3 assessment of cwsi and dact with respect to yield and irrigation thresholds the seasonal mean cwsi dact and yield as well as wilcoxon test results for significance are shown in table 5 the cwsi and dact values in table 5 were calculated as the seasonal mean of the daily values i e maximum values as the hourly mean that occurred between 1000 h and 1600 h following a similar procedure presented in the study by lena et al 2020 in 2018 the cwsi and dact seasonal means were significantly different across the plots except for the di with respect to the bi and si plots table 5 in 2019 no significant difference was found among dact mean results whereas cwsi mean results from the three investigated plots were found to be significantly different as anticipated the largest cwsi and dact mean values were estimated in the ni plot in both years in 2018 the bi plot showed the smallest cwsi and dact mean from the irrigated plots while in 2019 they were obtained in the di plot indices not assessed in the bi plot see section 2 3 correspondingly the smallest yield was measured in the ni plot in both years a decreasing trend can be observed in both seasons the yield from the bi plot was the largest followed by the yields from the si di and last the ni plots it was observed that the indices seasonal mean values were mostly in accordance with the observed yield reduction therefore the index quantification of stress can be considered reliable for these study conditions larger cwsi and dact values were measured in 2018 than in 2019 due to the differences between soybean varieties table 5 additionally the cwsi and dact values were particularly larger in the ni plot in 2018 due to the presence of longer drought periods during reproductive crop stages these results indicated that stress occurring during a specific sensitive growth stage might cause yield reduction even if enough soil water was available during the rest of the growing period notably similar yields were measured in the irrigated plots the yield results showed that a lower irrigation water productivity resulted from the si plot compared to the other two irrigated plots i e a similar yield was produced with a larger irrigation water amount these results support the index dynamics results which showed that the crops in the si plot presented higher levels of stress than the crops in the di and bi plots the large variability of the cwsi and dact values obtained from the irrigated plots make it difficult to establish a general threshold that indicates irrigation timing to avoid yield losses additionally the differences in precipitation and cloudy conditions between both seasons which resulted in overall less crop stress in 2019 than in 2018 suggested that cwsi and dact thresholds can vary depending on weather fluctuations as already indicated by lena et al 2020 however the feedback from the cwsi and dact after irrigation days provided information about well watered crop conditions one day after irrigation most cwsi values were 0 33 and all dact values were 2 3 c in the plots where the lowest indices as seasonal mean values were obtained i e bi plot in 2018 and di plot in 2019 table 5 therefore cwsi 0 33 and dact 2 3 c values can be indicators of well watered conditions after irrigation since on those days no major p event or rsr 0 7 was observed except for the slight rain on 10 august 2018 see table 3 studies that considered different irrigation treatments provided more insight into stress levels and irrigation thresholds for example candogan et al 2013 suggested a cwsi value of 0 36 as ideal for soybean irrigation timing to avoid yield reduction in a subhumid climate according to dejonge et al 2015 dact values 2 c and 5 c indicated no stress and moderate stress respectively for corn in a dry area these cwsi and dact values from the literature are comparable to those suggested in this study for soybeans to indicate well watered crop conditions cwsi interpretation has the advantage that an upper threshold of 1 represents the highest stress level in contrast no upper threshold for the dact method has been defined yet dact values within the range of 8 and 10 c were observed in this study as the cwsi approached a value of 1 fig 5 therefore a value near 9 c could represent the upper threshold of the dact method for soybeans in a subhumid climate however further research is required in this regard for example an evaluation of the indices over a wider range of stress conditions induced by different irrigation treatments applied by the same irrigation system 3 4 assessment of cwsi and dact with respect to matric potential daily cwsi and dact values i e maximum values as hourly means that occurred between 1000 h and 1600 h were plotted against matric potential ψ m measured with watermark sensors at 20 cm 40 cm and 60 cm soil depths ψ m values outside of the watermark measurement range after calibration were not considered days with rsr 0 70 and cc 80 were excluded from this analysis since the index results were uncertain additionally since the stress indices are more responsive at higher temperatures i e above t critical according to dejonge et al 2015 the data were screened for days with tc 28 c the correlation plots between ψ m and the indices that resulted in relatively large r2 values 0 35 are shown in fig 7 for 2018 a logarithmic correlation was found between ψ m in 20 and cwsi in the ni di and si plots for ni fig 7a si fig 7b and di fig 7c the correlation resulted in r2 0 88 r2 0 69 and r2 0 38 respectively the r2 values from si and di are within the range of 0 36 r2 0 69 found by mohamed et al 2019 after correlating linearly cwsi vs ψ m measured at 15 cm and 46 cm depths the correlation of cwsi decreased with stress level the largest r2 was found in ni followed by si and di which is the same trend as the seasonal cwsi values see table 5 this was attributed to the wider range of ψ m measured in the ni and si plots compared to the di plot fig 3 additionally a weak correlation was found between cwsi and ψ m at 40 and 60 cm in the four plots 0 r2 0 30 not shown the better correlation between ψ m and cwsi in the ni than in the other plots and between cwsi and ψ m at 20 cm compared to the other two depths suggests that the cwsi responds better under moderate to high stress levels and to the water uptake dynamics at shallow depths regarding dact no correlation was found between ψ m and dact in the si di and bi plots r2 0 08 not shown the strongest correlations were found in the ni plot for ψ m at the three depths fig 7 dact vs ψ m at 20 cm fig 7d ψ m at 40 cm fig 7e and ψ m at 60 cm fig 7f resulted in r2 0 38 r2 0 43 and r2 0 51 respectively contrary to the cwsi the correlation between ψ m and dact increased with depth therefore a larger percentage of dact changes can be explained by matric potential conditions at 40 and 60 cm depths compared to cwsi these results suggested that under severe stress conditions indices that are solely dominated by tc might be a better representation of soil water availability within a larger portion of the effective root zone than indices that depend on other meteorological variables there was essentially no correlation between ψ m and the indices in 2019 r2 0 05 not shown the fact that mostly weak correlations resulted from the regression analysis was attributed to naturally delayed processes within the soilplant atmosphere continuum one aspect is that ψ m sensors require a certain time to reach hydraulic equilibrium with the surrounding soil water to provide representative measurements additionally water movement in the vadose zone and root water uptake can be slow therefore during the ψ m sensor equilibrium process the irt sensors might have reacted to external factors due to their higher sensitivity to atmospheric conditions this ψ m delayed response was more likely to take place in the irrigated plots and in 2019 in general since the indices fluctuated more due to more wetting events additionally due to the complexity of the system it is difficult to explain every outlier for example the points marked with arrows in fig 7 were excluded from the regression because the low index values underrepresented the soil water availability at the depth in question such index values could be interpreted as root water uptake from deeper soils in the case of cwsi and shallower soil layers in the case of dact 4 conclusions the cwsi and dact methods were assessed as potential tc based irrigation scheduling tools for soybeans in a subhumid environment the assessment was carried out over four plots under different water management conditions the lower and upper cwsi limits developed in this study using data from two consecutive years generated satisfactory results the cwsi and dact indices were responsive to dry and wet periods especially under severe stress conditions therefore it was concluded that both indices are appropriate methods for signaling and quantifying crop stress in subhumid environments an improvement in the interpretation of the indices with respect to cloudy conditions was observed after using the maximum mean value between 1000 and 1600 h as a daily index these results indicated that measurements with high temporal resolution can help identify the actual daily stress response of the indices in subhumid environments with prevalent cloudy skies the indices seasonal mean values were in accordance with the observed relative yield reduction that is the plots with the largest cwsi and dact seasonal values produced the smallest yields regarding irrigation thresholds cwsi and dact values of approximately 0 33 and 2 3 c respectively were indicators of well watered conditions and irrigation may be necessary when the indices exceed those values the correlation between the indices and matric potential was higher under rainfed conditions than under irrigated crops the analysis resulted in a very good logarithmic correlation for cwsi and matric potential at the shallowest depth of 20 cm compared to the correlation with matric potential at 40 cm and 60 cm depths conversely the dact correlation with matric potential increased with depth and was fairly large thus it is recommended that the dact method be selected over the cwsi when the objective is to consider the whole soil plant atmosphere continuum for irrigation scheduling purposes the dact method was found to be as effective as the well established cwsi with fewer monitoring and computational requirements therefore the dact represents an

9072,crop stress indicators can serve as a basis for demand oriented irrigation management canopy temperature based algorithms in combination with nondestructive infrared thermometer measurements are widely used mainly in arid regions due to the impact of climate change on agricultural production canopy temperature based indices are increasingly applied in humid areas of central europe this requires an evaluation of the algorithms under local environmental conditions the objective of this study was to assess the crop water stress index cwsi and the degrees above canopy threshold dact as irrigation scheduling methods in a subhumid agricultural area in austria the study was performed in 2018 and 2019 on a soybean field that was divided into four plots under different water management conditions one of the plots was irrigated by means of sprinklers si plot another one by drip lines di plot and a third one by a hose reel boom bi plot the fourth plot ni was rainfed to be able to relate crop water status to soil water status soil matric potential ψ m was monitored at 20 40 and 60 cm depths both cwsi and dact reflected the different plant water conditions accordingly the highest stress levels were found in the ni plot followed by the si di and bi plots the interpretation of the indices regarding cloudy skies was improved by using the maximum cwsi and dact observed between 1000 h and 1600 h overall the plots with lower seasonal mean indices produced larger yields and vice versa the ψ m correlation results suggested that under severe stress a better representation of soil water availability down to 60 cm can be obtained when using the dact compared to the cwsi the dact was considered a more practical alternative than the cwsi since it requires less effort and proved to be equally effective abbreviations bi plot irrigated with boom system cc canopy cover in cwsi crop water stress index dact degrees above canopy threshold in c dap days after

degrees above canopy threshold irrigation systems yield soil matric potential data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction agriculture is likely to suffer from different levels of water scarcity in many parts of the world due to climate change cai et al 2015 consequently crop yields are projected to have positive or negative impacts depending on regional conditions such as temperature changes and co2 levels rosenzweig et al 2014 in addition irrigation requirements are expected to increase in most agricultural areas of the northern hemisphere mainly due to summer precipitation reduction döll 2002 these climate change impacts on agriculture directly affect food security ainsworth and ort 2010 soybean is a major protein crop whose cultivation has recently increased in europe with austria among the top ten production countries of the continent fogelberg and recknagel 2017 however considerable soybean yield reductions due to summer droughts have been reported in austria over the past decade although the cultivation area of soybean has increased statistik austria 2018 therefore improvements in irrigation scheduling techniques are recommended to stabilize soybean production and to preserve water resources irrigation scheduling for example can be based on crop water status monitoring the crop water status indicates the current condition from sufficiently watered to severely stressed therefore it gives good information on when to irrigate crop water stress can be detected for example by an increase in canopy temperature tc in this context infrared radiometers irts are increasingly used as a nondestructive method to monitor tc the measured data are usually converted into standardized indices to make the application more practical tc based indices can be used as decision support algorithms for irrigation scheduling for instance the crop water stress index cwsi developed by idso et al 1981 is a widely used method several authors have established cwsi thresholds with respect to the optimization of irrigation scheduling nielsen 1990 o shaughnessy et al 2012 erdem et al 2010 osroosh et al 2015 the cwsi is based on the difference between air and canopy temperature which generally increases when water stress occurs in addition to these temperature data upper and lower limits are needed to relate the temperature differences to the prevailing environmental conditions the cwsi can be calculated using either an empirical or a theoretical approach in the empirical approach the canopy air temperature differentials dtm are normalized between lower dtll and upper dtul limits as a function of vapor pressure deficit vpd both limits should be defined for specific crop and climatic conditions according to baker et al 2013 the cwsi is characterized by daily fluctuations resulting from the sensitivity of the index to changing meteorological conditions including vapor pressure deficit vpd additionally dejonge et al 2015 and pramanik et al 2017 stated that the need for continuous on site monitoring of micrometeorological variables such as relative humidity and air temperature to calculate vpd limits the practical use of the cwsi as an irrigation decision support algorithm therefore alternative procedures to quantify water stress in crops have been suggested that can be easily adopted by smallholder water managers for instance dejonge et al 2015 proposed the degrees above canopy threshold dact which appears to be a practical alternative because it requires only tc measurements consequently the dact can be calculated with less monitoring and computational effort than the cwsi however the applicability of the dact requires evaluation for crops and climatic conditions different from those presented by dejonge et al 2015 limited use of tc based indices such as cwsi and dact has been suggested for humid environments where low vpd and cloudy skies are prevalent the reasons are that low vpd affects dtll definition and cloudy conditions make the irt sensors less responsive to crop water status jensen et al 1990 precipitation distribution is another factor that strongly influences cwsi dynamics in humid environments especially with respect to setting irrigation thresholds lena et al 2020 however studies that evaluated the cwsi method as an irrigation scheduling algorithm in humid bockhold et al 2011 humid to subtropical kar and kumar 2010 lena et al 2020 and subhumid climates candogan et al 2013 have shown promising results regarding dact there are no studies that address its performance in a subhumid climate there is also a lack of studies comparing the effects of different irrigation systems on the cwsi and dact under realistic conditions therefore research is needed to contribute to a better understanding of tc based indices as irrigation scheduling tools in subhumid regions in addition to crop water status soil water status can also be used for irrigation scheduling the soil water status can be expressed as matric potential indicating the availability of soil water for crop uptake knowing the soil water status helps in planning irrigation events with respect to time and amount although crop and soil water stress are interrelated the interactions need to be studied in detail because they are based on complex processes within the soilplant atmosphere continuum spac erdem et al 2010 stated that crop water stress measurements should be calibrated with a reliable soil water status indicator to be used as a complement in irrigation scheduling however dejonge et al 2015 and mohamed et al 2019 presented rather low r2 values after correlating cwsi and dact to soil water status indicators low correlations between cwsi and indicators of soil status in the root system can be attributed to the sensitivity of the index to weather fluctuations chen et al 2010 in this context studies of the relationships between plant water stress indices and soil water status at different rooting depths would be interesting this could lead to an improvement in irrigation scheduling by combining and using the different indicators in the best possible way the objective of this study was to assess the cwsi and dact methods on soybeans growing in a subhumid area under different water management conditions the assessment was carried out with respect to 1 meteorological conditions and irrigation 2 yield reduction and irrigation thresholds and 3 matric potential measured at different depths a complementary objective was to develop the lower and upper cwsi limits for implementing this method in a subhumid region 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiments were conducted during the summers of 2018 and 2019 at the agricultural school in obersiebenbrunn landwirtschaftliche fachschule lfs in lower austria 48 15 49 8 n 16 42 01 7 e elevation 151 m the climate in the region is subhumid the average annual precipitation p and air temperature ta between 1990 and 2019 were 550 mm and 11 c respectively according to data from the zentralanstalt für meteorologie und geodynamik zamg the average p ta and relative humidity rh during the summer months are shown in table 1 for the long term data series 1990 2019 and the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons the soil between 0 and 15 cm depth was classified as sandy silt whereas that between 15 and 60 cm was classified as sandy loam the soil from 60 to 120 cm depth was loamy sand classification was made according to the austrian texture triangle classification önorm l 1050 fig 1 shows water retention curves fitted using the retc program van genuchten et al 1991 after analyzing undisturbed soil samples 200 cm3 in a pressure plate apparatus ppa the soil samples were collected at 20 40 and 60 cm depths the soybean varieties antonia mg 000 and lenka mg 00 were planted in 2018 and 2019 respectively soybeans in mg 000 and mg 00 differ in seeding rates with yields of 4 5 and 4 packages of 150 000 grains respectively in both years a precision seeder was used 80 grains m 2 with a row spacing of 50 cm and a seeding depth of 5 cm details of the crop growth stages according to fehr and caviness 1977 are listed in table 2 the crop stage lengths were determined based on field observations and supplementary crop information described in irrigation and drainage paper 66 from the food and agricultural organization fao steduto et al 2012 the development of the crop was homogeneous across the field similarly the maximum rooting depth was defined as 90 cm due to the difference in maturity group variant antonia in 2018 reached maturity earlier than lenka in 2019 2 2 irrigation management the experimental site had a total extension of 120 120 m2 and was divided into four rectangular plots three of which were irrigated and one of which was rainfed a monitoring station equipped with several sensors was installed at each plot in this area the prevailing wind directions are northwest and southeast dobesch and neuwirt 1982 schemes of the experimental site and surrounding area as well as the relative position of the plots are shown in fig 2 irrigation was provided by a boom sprinkler and drip system with sprinklers being the most commonly used in the agricultural areas of austria the irrigated plots were referred to as bi boom irrigation si sprinkler irrigation and di drip irrigation the rainfed plot was denoted as ni no irrigation the widths of the plots were 60 m 17 m 18 m and 25 m for bi si di and ni respectively fig 2b two multistage centrifugal pumps with 22 kw of power were used to pump the irrigation water with an operating pressure of 5 bar the boom system distributed the water by means of rotating nozzles with large intensity and covered a strip width of approximately 60 m model a50 röhren und pumpenwerk bauer gmbh austria it was mounted on a three wheeled machine that was supplied with water and moved across the field via a rotating hose reel in the sprinkler irrigated plot a total of seven metal impact sprinklers model 233b naandan jain irrigation ltd india that covered an 18 m radius were installed on quick coupling pipes the main difference between the boom and sprinkler systems was that the former applied water with higher intensity the driplines model stremaline x 16080 netafim ltd israel were installed with a lateral distance of 0 5 m and had drippers every 0 3 m with a flow rate of 0 7 l h 1 a plot harvester was used to obtain the yield the mean yields of the plots were calculated from four measurements made in each of the four plots each of the sixteen yield measurements were taken from an area of 15 m2 the irrigation events were scheduled by the farmers who work at the agricultural school based on their experience the irrigation decisions were supported by matric potential measurements of sensors installed at 20 cm depth the intended irrigation threshold was 100 kpa however under real conditions it was not achieved in all cases for example a variation of 20 kpa was observed in the bi and si plots and 40 kpa in the di plot the latter due to the heterogeneity of the water distribution by drippers the irrigation amounts were set in advance based on operational practices and the water holding capacity of the soil profile additionally the amounts were adapted to compensate different application efficiencies for example larger evaporation losses expected in the sprinkler irrigated plot on days when the three plots were irrigated the systems ran simultaneously the volume of water pumped was measured with a flowmeter and the irrigation amounts were calculated by relating them to the area it is noteworthy that all irrigated plots should generally represent an optimal irrigation treatment without water stress in humid and subhumid areas supplemental irrigation scheduling depends greatly on precipitation regimes fereres and soriano 2007 in this study precipitation p was measured at a weather station close to the experimental site the details about irrigation events and p are shown in table 3 due to the large number of small wetting events only those that were larger than 2 0 mm and occurred two weeks before the first irrigation and two weeks after the last irrigation are presented in this table the total p from planting to harvest was 272 mm in 2018 and 278 mm in 2019 p in 2019 was characterized by small and frequent events although similar total p amounts were registered in both seasons the events in 2019 were more evenly distributed 2 3 temperature and humidity measurements the monitoring stations collected data between 5 july and 19 september dap 70 146 in 2018 and 1 july until 30 september dap 54 145 in 2019 each monitoring station was equipped with an infrared radiometer irt si 411 apogee instruments inc u s a the irt sensors were installed at a height of 1 8 m and mounted with a view angle of 45 to measure canopy temperature tc within a standard target area of approximately 6 m2 22 half angle field of view the crops reached approximately 1 m in height after full development therefore tc was measured approximately 0 8 m above the canopy the irt sensors were calibrated by the manufacturer and the specific calibration coefficients were integrated into the sensors to obtain the corrected readings considering the effect of body temperature corrections for emissivity and background effects were also applied to all measurements following the approach presented in blonquist et al 2009 to obtain the target temperature ta and rh were measured at a weather station near the experimental site with a tr1 sensor adcon telemetry by ott hydromet gmbh austria installed at 2 m height the temporal resolution of the irt and tr1 measurements was 15 min the values were temporarily stored within remote terminal units and finally transmitted to a central server via a telemetry network approximately every hour the data were retrieved from the online platform adcon addvantage pro 6 6 due to a technical failure of the irt sensors in the di and bi plots tc measurements were interrupted on 9 september 2019 dap 123 in the di plot and were not possible at all during the entire 2019 measurement period in the bi plot 2 4 cwsi and dact the empirical crop water stress index cwsi idso et al 1981 jackson et al 1981 relates the difference between the measured canopy and air temperatures dtm to the lower dtll and upper dtul limits of those differentials the cwsi values range between 1 indicating full stress and 0 indicating no stress and were estimated as follows 1 cwsi dtm dtll dtul dtll to compute the cwsi according to eq 1 dtll was established by relating canopy air temperature differentials tc ta to vapor pressure deficit vpd using dtll m vpd b where m and b are the slope and intercept of the linear relationship respectively dtul was estimated as dtul m vpg b where vpg is the vapor pressure gradient the first step to assess the cwsi was to develop dtll for the specific conditions of this study temperature differentials tc ta and vpd were calculated for each plot rh and ta readings from tr1 were used to calculate vpd as the difference between saturated vapor pressure and actual vapor pressure following the procedure of allen et al 1998 days that represented well watered conditions were selected to develop dtll a method similar to that used by taghvaeian et al 2012 was used for the selection the selection criterion was that the data points tc ta vs vpd collected one day after major wetting events i e irrigation or precipitation followed the trend of a nonstressed crop as shown by idso et al 1981 and taghvaeian et al 2012 for such days dtm values represent the lower limit dtll because this method assumes that the soil water storage is replenished and the crops have access to sufficient soil water taghvaeian et al 2012 since cloud cover affects canopy temperature the cwsi empirical method is only valid under clear sky conditions therefore it was verified that the selected days for dtll had relative solar radiation rsr larger than 0 70 as suggested by taghvaeian et al 2012 rsr was calculated on a daily basis as the ratio of measured global radiation rs and calculated clear sky radiation rso rsr varies between approximately 0 33 dense cloud cover and 1 clear sky allen et al 1998 once dtll was developed vpg was calculated as the difference between saturated air vapor pressure at air temperature and saturated air vapor pressure at air temperature plus the coefficient b from the dtll equation dtul was estimated using the same slope and intercept developed for dtll taghvaeian et al 2014 finally the limits i e dtll and dtul were used in eq 1 along with corresponding dtm measurements to estimate the cwsi cwsi values smaller than zero and greater than one were set to zero and one respectively the degrees above canopy threshold dact was introduced by dejonge et al 2015 and quantifies the temperature difference above the critical temperature t critical for the crop the dact represented as an index was computed as follows dejonge et al 2015 2 dact h max 0 tc h t critical where tc is the canopy temperature of the crop at a given time h and t critical is the threshold temperature for the crop in this study a value of 28 c was used as t critical for soybeans under humid conditions according to bockhold et al 2011 dact from eq 2 gives a value of zero to indicate no stress assuming that the crop is not stressed if the canopy temperature is below t critical limited canopy cover incorporates background effects into tc measurements colaizzi et al 2012 therefore cwsi and dact were assessed for irt measurements collected over canopy cover cc greater than 80 as suggested by dejonge et al 2015 the assessment period for each season is indicated in table 4 the periods included the r1 flowering to r5 beginning of seed growth stages and ended when crop senescence started in 2019 in addition to irt data from reproductive stages the indices were also assessed for the irt data collected during the last days of the vegetative period between 1 july and 6 july even though tc measurements were affected by cc 80 this was done to evaluate the cwsi and dact response to the irrigation events on 4 july in the di and si plots four tc rh and vpd readings were collected every hour at 15 minute intervals thus the two indices i e cwsi and dact were calculated individually for all four replicates and then averaged to hourly values 2 5 soil matric potential measurements watermark granular matrix sensors irrometer co usa were connected to the monitoring stations to monitor the soil matric potential ψ m the measurements from the watermark sensors were obtained in each plot at 20 40 and 60 cm depths during both growing seasons the three sensors were installed approximately 30 cm apart from each other the measurements were collected with a storage interval of 15 min and were averaged to obtain daily values the data were retrieved from the online platform adcon addvantage pro 6 6 the calibration of watermark sensors was performed in a previous study by nolz et al 2013 the range of the watermark was from 0 to 200 kpa according to the manufacturer after the extrapolation of the calibration curve by nolz et al 2013 the measurement range increased to 0 630 kpa therefore matric potential values larger than 200 kpa might contain a larger uncertainty the watermark measurements used in this study correspond to absolute values of ψ m fig 3 depicts the matric potential evolution during the studied growing seasons of 2018 and 2019 at different depths 2 6 statistical analysis data processing and statistical analysis were conducted using microsoft excel r software r core team 2019 and the curveexpert basic program hyams 2017 a least square regression was performed to develop dtll using tc ta versus vpd data and to correlate dact versus matric potential measurements regressions between matric potential measurements and cwsi were performed in curveexpert basic hyams 2017 which uses the levenbergmarquardt method to solve nonlinear regressions the differences between the seasonal mean cwsi and dact from the four plots calculated for 2018 as well as for 2019 were tested using a wilcoxon pairedwise difference test 3 results and discussion 3 1 development of dtll and dtul for cwsi assessment the tc ta vs vpd data points for dtll development were selected following the method of taghvaeian et al 2012 in this study data points one day after wetting events did not always show the characteristic linear relationship shown by idso et al 1981 and taghvaeian et al 2012 therefore the selection was extended by identifying days that fulfilled the trend criterion the trend was observed for some days in the bi plot in 2018 and in the di plot in 2019 even though no major wetting event had taken place one day before it was concluded that the values from the selected days represented well watered crop conditions however no data points in si that represented well irrigated conditions were found probably due to water losses caused by wind drift and evaporation in total thirteen days were selected for dtll development fig 4 the linear segment between 1000 h and 1600 h was extracted from the daily curves resulting in 360 tc ta vs vpd data points the least square regression resulted in dtll 3 64 2 17 vpd fig 4 the r2 value of 0 74 is typical for dtll determined with data collected from different crop growing stages gardner et al 1992 the values of m and b presented in this study were smaller and larger respectively than what other authors reported nielsen 1990 determined dtll 2 51 2 02 vpd and the result of m was similar to the result presented here in contrast candogan et al 2013 elaborated dtll 0 65 1 85 vpd for soybeans in a subhumid climate in this study the data from two soybean varieties planted in two different seasons were used to develop dtll the reason for this was that the combined data showed the same linear trend fig 4 and highly similar coefficients not shown therefore it was concluded that the dtll developed with the combined data represented both soybean variants other studies have shown combinations of data to develop cwsi baselines for instance idso et al 1981 elaborated dtll 1 44 1 34 vpd for data collected over soybeans at widely spread locations in the usa the dtll result presented here was obtained for a rather narrow vpd range of 0 4 3 kpa which can lead to inaccuracies when calculating the cwsi jensen et al 1990 however adequate cwsi values resulting from narrow vpd ranges have often been reported for example vpd of 1 4 kpa taghvaeian et al 2012 candogan et al 2013 0 4 kpa payero and irmak 2006 and 0 5 2 1 kpa lebourgeois et al 2010 erdem et al 2010 it has been suggested that a vpd range of 1 6 kpa is required to define a dtll that could be used in many locations gardner and shock 1989 nevertheless for a certain dataset nielsen 1990 showed the invalidity of dtll suggested by idso et al 1981 although it was developed for a relatively wide vpd range of 0 6 kpa therefore the vpd range for the dtll definition depends not only on climatic conditions but also on management practices in this study dtll was determined for crops under typical management practices in the region the results of dtul calculated for all dtm values within the assessment period ranged between 4 0 and 6 6 c candogan et al 2013 and tekelioğlu et al 2017 found dtul 3 2 c and dtul 4 0 c respectively payero and irmak 2006 used a multiple regression analysis and obtained a dtul of 2 8 c calculated for rs 800 wm 2 and u2 2 0 ms 1 therefore a relatively large dtul was found in this study compared to what has been reported thus far for soybeans the differences between this study dtll and dtul results and other baselines were attributed to differences in climatic conditions soybean varieties and management practices therefore their use in future investigations would require similar conditions to those of the present study 3 2 assessment of cwsi and dact with respect to meteorological conditions and irrigation events hourly mean cwsi and dact were calculated for the two seasons for the assessment periods indicated in table 4 the hourly intervals considered were between 1000 h and 1600 h this interval was chosen to avoid false increases in tc that might occur in the early morning or late afternoon when low radiation might cause partial stomata closure wanjura and upchurch 1997 according to taghvaeian et al 2012 data collection time is important when implementing the cwsi they suggested that the hourly interval at which the maximum seasonal mean cwsi is estimated should be used as the time of the day to monitor the cwsi as an irrigation scheduling tool in this study the basic trend of reaching a peak value at mid day hours and decreasing during the afternoon was observed in both indices in all plots however the maximum seasonal mean value of the indices was observed at different hourly intervals between 1000 h and 1600 h depending on the index and the plot in 2018 the maximum mean cwsi was found at the hourly intervals of 1000 1100 h in the bi plot 1100 1200 h in the si and ni plots and 1300 1400 h in the di plot in the same year the maximum mean dact was found at 1400 1300 h in the bi si and ni plots while in the di plot it was observed at 1300 1400 h in 2019 both indices maximum mean values were obtained a few hours later compared to 2018 maximum mean cwsi and dact in the di and ni plots were found at 1400 1300 h however in the si plot maximum mean cwsi and dact were observed at 1500 1600 h therefore the time of the day at which maximum mean index values were measured was subject to irrigation water management and precipitation distribution furthermore the different soybean responses to water stress between the two seasons could have been influenced by the difference in soybean varieties the variability of the hourly interval at which maximum seasonal mean indices occurred produced uncertainties regarding the selection of the daily value additionally the influence of cloudiness on irt measurements during some days produced a reduction in the indices at different hourly intervals on such days the indices often increased later in the day depicting a more representative value of crop stress discussed later to adapt the methods to the conditions of this study and to obtain a reliable representation of the crop stress levels daily cwsi and dact were selected by identifying the maximum value as an hourly mean that occurred between 1000 h and 1600 h for each day within the assessment period the variations in the stress indices during the 2018 and 2019 seasons are illustrated in fig 5 and fig 6 respectively the cwsi changes in 2018 are shown in fig 5a the cwsi decreased in the bi and si plots on irrigation days however cwsi in the di plot did not show a decrease on irrigation days except for the event on 31 july the dact values in 2018 fig 5b were 0 c or slightly larger than 0 c after the first two irrigation events in the three irrigated plots during the third irrigation event on 9 august dact in the si and di plots remained relatively large i e 5 c whereas it decreased in the bi this result can be attributed to the higher levels of crop stress accumulated over previous days in the si and di plots compared to the bi plots the indices in the ni plot showed less variability than those in the irrigated plots with longer periods of increased values and marked reductions on rainy days an increase in both indices was observed in the si and ni plots at the end of the assessment period and the latter even showed cwsi values greater than 1 equal to 1 in fig 5a this was due to cumulative stress which induced early senescence in the crops in the si and ni plots variations in the cwsi in 2019 are shown in fig 6a generally cwsi values in the di plot were smaller on irrigation days and on the days following irrigation compared to the si plot the irrigation in the si plot on 2 august produced a value of cwsi 0 equal to 0 in fig 6a while after the irrigation event on 22 july the cwsi was not reduced and remained almost constant 0 5 two days later the cwsi in 2019 showed more pronounced peaks in both the high and low ranges compared to the 2018 results especially in the ni plot additionally a decreasing trend of the cwsi was observed in the three plots from the start to the end of the assessment period this can be attributed to the frequent small p events that occurred in 2019 which prevented the increase in the cwsi over long periods a larger cwsi decrease after rainfall was observed in the ni plot than in the other plots this behavior was also observed in mildly stressed crops in the study by lena et al 2020 when cwsi 0 4 before a wetting event the dact changes in 2019 are shown in fig 6b on irrigation days dact values smaller than 5 c were observed a clear increase in dact was observed between 23 and 26 july in all plots due to the absence of wetting events in the first half of the assessment period dact values in the ni plot were larger than those in the other plots after 19 july the dact values were similar to those in the si plot until the end of the period this similarity between the ni and si suggests that the crops in the si plot suffered from stress levels comparable to those in the ni plot both indices showed large values between 1 and 6 july because of incomplete cc for instance cwsi 1 in the ni plot on 1 and 3 july equal to 1 in fig 6a taghvaeian et al 2012 and dejonge et al 2015 suggested that rsr values greater than 0 7 and 0 8 respectively represented suitable clear sky solar radiation conditions for the validity of tc based stress indices in this study days without clear sky conditions i e cloudy days in terms of rsr were rather frequent rsr 0 7 occurred on 34 and 40 of the days in 2018 and 2019 respectively cloudy conditions were usually observed when precipitation occurred these cloudy conditions produced low peaks that introduced uncertainties in the interpretation of the indices in an attempt to overcome this limitation the maximum cwsi and dact values occurring on a day were selected as daily stress indices however the reduction of the indices was still observed on some of the days in 2018 the combined effect of precipitation and cloudy skies was observed as the indices decreased on 6 and 10 july and 10 and 14 august fig 5 in 2019 this effect was observed on 12 and 13 july fig 6 the indices also decreased on days without p but with rsr 0 7 for example in 2019 on 7 and 21 july and 14 august fig 6 in the si plot rsr values of 0 33 on 27 july and 0 40 on 2 august 2019 the latter combined with an irrigation event produced cwsi 0 equal to 0 on fig 6a an rsr value of 0 36 on 21 august resulted in cwsi 0 in all plots equal to 0 in fig 6a in this study the effect of clouds was easier to detect and interpret in the dact results since this index showed values of 0 c on most days with rsr 0 7 the effect of cloudy skies on the cwsi method was also observed in preliminary results from a study conducted under similar climatic conditions in germany anter and kraft 2018 cloudy conditions are quite frequent in humid areas therefore more research should be conducted to investigate the relative solar radiation rsr value at which a significant reduction in irt measurements starts and thus propose a lower rsr threshold for these climates the dynamics of the indices showed that they generally decreased during wetting events and decreased as water was depleted due to crop evapotranspiration in addition the indices were found to be highly responsive under severe stress conditions i e ni plot 3 3 assessment of cwsi and dact with respect to yield and irrigation thresholds the seasonal mean cwsi dact and yield as well as wilcoxon test results for significance are shown in table 5 the cwsi and dact values in table 5 were calculated as the seasonal mean of the daily values i e maximum values as the hourly mean that occurred between 1000 h and 1600 h following a similar procedure presented in the study by lena et al 2020 in 2018 the cwsi and dact seasonal means were significantly different across the plots except for the di with respect to the bi and si plots table 5 in 2019 no significant difference was found among dact mean results whereas cwsi mean results from the three investigated plots were found to be significantly different as anticipated the largest cwsi and dact mean values were estimated in the ni plot in both years in 2018 the bi plot showed the smallest cwsi and dact mean from the irrigated plots while in 2019 they were obtained in the di plot indices not assessed in the bi plot see section 2 3 correspondingly the smallest yield was measured in the ni plot in both years a decreasing trend can be observed in both seasons the yield from the bi plot was the largest followed by the yields from the si di and last the ni plots it was observed that the indices seasonal mean values were mostly in accordance with the observed yield reduction therefore the index quantification of stress can be considered reliable for these study conditions larger cwsi and dact values were measured in 2018 than in 2019 due to the differences between soybean varieties table 5 additionally the cwsi and dact values were particularly larger in the ni plot in 2018 due to the presence of longer drought periods during reproductive crop stages these results indicated that stress occurring during a specific sensitive growth stage might cause yield reduction even if enough soil water was available during the rest of the growing period notably similar yields were measured in the irrigated plots the yield results showed that a lower irrigation water productivity resulted from the si plot compared to the other two irrigated plots i e a similar yield was produced with a larger irrigation water amount these results support the index dynamics results which showed that the crops in the si plot presented higher levels of stress than the crops in the di and bi plots the large variability of the cwsi and dact values obtained from the irrigated plots make it difficult to establish a general threshold that indicates irrigation timing to avoid yield losses additionally the differences in precipitation and cloudy conditions between both seasons which resulted in overall less crop stress in 2019 than in 2018 suggested that cwsi and dact thresholds can vary depending on weather fluctuations as already indicated by lena et al 2020 however the feedback from the cwsi and dact after irrigation days provided information about well watered crop conditions one day after irrigation most cwsi values were 0 33 and all dact values were 2 3 c in the plots where the lowest indices as seasonal mean values were obtained i e bi plot in 2018 and di plot in 2019 table 5 therefore cwsi 0 33 and dact 2 3 c values can be indicators of well watered conditions after irrigation since on those days no major p event or rsr 0 7 was observed except for the slight rain on 10 august 2018 see table 3 studies that considered different irrigation treatments provided more insight into stress levels and irrigation thresholds for example candogan et al 2013 suggested a cwsi value of 0 36 as ideal for soybean irrigation timing to avoid yield reduction in a subhumid climate according to dejonge et al 2015 dact values 2 c and 5 c indicated no stress and moderate stress respectively for corn in a dry area these cwsi and dact values from the literature are comparable to those suggested in this study for soybeans to indicate well watered crop conditions cwsi interpretation has the advantage that an upper threshold of 1 represents the highest stress level in contrast no upper threshold for the dact method has been defined yet dact values within the range of 8 and 10 c were observed in this study as the cwsi approached a value of 1 fig 5 therefore a value near 9 c could represent the upper threshold of the dact method for soybeans in a subhumid climate however further research is required in this regard for example an evaluation of the indices over a wider range of stress conditions induced by different irrigation treatments applied by the same irrigation system 3 4 assessment of cwsi and dact with respect to matric potential daily cwsi and dact values i e maximum values as hourly means that occurred between 1000 h and 1600 h were plotted against matric potential ψ m measured with watermark sensors at 20 cm 40 cm and 60 cm soil depths ψ m values outside of the watermark measurement range after calibration were not considered days with rsr 0 70 and cc 80 were excluded from this analysis since the index results were uncertain additionally since the stress indices are more responsive at higher temperatures i e above t critical according to dejonge et al 2015 the data were screened for days with tc 28 c the correlation plots between ψ m and the indices that resulted in relatively large r2 values 0 35 are shown in fig 7 for 2018 a logarithmic correlation was found between ψ m in 20 and cwsi in the ni di and si plots for ni fig 7a si fig 7b and di fig 7c the correlation resulted in r2 0 88 r2 0 69 and r2 0 38 respectively the r2 values from si and di are within the range of 0 36 r2 0 69 found by mohamed et al 2019 after correlating linearly cwsi vs ψ m measured at 15 cm and 46 cm depths the correlation of cwsi decreased with stress level the largest r2 was found in ni followed by si and di which is the same trend as the seasonal cwsi values see table 5 this was attributed to the wider range of ψ m measured in the ni and si plots compared to the di plot fig 3 additionally a weak correlation was found between cwsi and ψ m at 40 and 60 cm in the four plots 0 r2 0 30 not shown the better correlation between ψ m and cwsi in the ni than in the other plots and between cwsi and ψ m at 20 cm compared to the other two depths suggests that the cwsi responds better under moderate to high stress levels and to the water uptake dynamics at shallow depths regarding dact no correlation was found between ψ m and dact in the si di and bi plots r2 0 08 not shown the strongest correlations were found in the ni plot for ψ m at the three depths fig 7 dact vs ψ m at 20 cm fig 7d ψ m at 40 cm fig 7e and ψ m at 60 cm fig 7f resulted in r2 0 38 r2 0 43 and r2 0 51 respectively contrary to the cwsi the correlation between ψ m and dact increased with depth therefore a larger percentage of dact changes can be explained by matric potential conditions at 40 and 60 cm depths compared to cwsi these results suggested that under severe stress conditions indices that are solely dominated by tc might be a better representation of soil water availability within a larger portion of the effective root zone than indices that depend on other meteorological variables there was essentially no correlation between ψ m and the indices in 2019 r2 0 05 not shown the fact that mostly weak correlations resulted from the regression analysis was attributed to naturally delayed processes within the soilplant atmosphere continuum one aspect is that ψ m sensors require a certain time to reach hydraulic equilibrium with the surrounding soil water to provide representative measurements additionally water movement in the vadose zone and root water uptake can be slow therefore during the ψ m sensor equilibrium process the irt sensors might have reacted to external factors due to their higher sensitivity to atmospheric conditions this ψ m delayed response was more likely to take place in the irrigated plots and in 2019 in general since the indices fluctuated more due to more wetting events additionally due to the complexity of the system it is difficult to explain every outlier for example the points marked with arrows in fig 7 were excluded from the regression because the low index values underrepresented the soil water availability at the depth in question such index values could be interpreted as root water uptake from deeper soils in the case of cwsi and shallower soil layers in the case of dact 4 conclusions the cwsi and dact methods were assessed as potential tc based irrigation scheduling tools for soybeans in a subhumid environment the assessment was carried out over four plots under different water management conditions the lower and upper cwsi limits developed in this study using data from two consecutive years generated satisfactory results the cwsi and dact indices were responsive to dry and wet periods especially under severe stress conditions therefore it was concluded that both indices are appropriate methods for signaling and quantifying crop stress in subhumid environments an improvement in the interpretation of the indices with respect to cloudy conditions was observed after using the maximum mean value between 1000 and 1600 h as a daily index these results indicated that measurements with high temporal resolution can help identify the actual daily stress response of the indices in subhumid environments with prevalent cloudy skies the indices seasonal mean values were in accordance with the observed relative yield reduction that is the plots with the largest cwsi and dact seasonal values produced the smallest yields regarding irrigation thresholds cwsi and dact values of approximately 0 33 and 2 3 c respectively were indicators of well watered conditions and irrigation may be necessary when the indices exceed those values the correlation between the indices and matric potential was higher under rainfed conditions than under irrigated crops the analysis resulted in a very good logarithmic correlation for cwsi and matric potential at the shallowest depth of 20 cm compared to the correlation with matric potential at 40 cm and 60 cm depths conversely the dact correlation with matric potential increased with depth and was fairly large thus it is recommended that the dact method be selected over the cwsi when the objective is to consider the whole soil plant atmosphere continuum for irrigation scheduling purposes the dact method was found to be as effective as the well established cwsi with fewer monitoring and computational requirements therefore the dact represents an

9073,shortage of high quality seeds of native species particularly for xerophyte shrubs have severely limited grassland restoration in the arid region of china however little attention has been devoted to improving seed yield and quality in the xerophyte shrub we conducted a three year field experiment from 2019 to 2020 to investigate the effects of four irrigation treatments i e w0 non irrigated control w1 irrigation at winter w2 irrigation at winter and regreening w3 irrigation at winter regreening and peak flowering via subsurface drip irrigation on the seed yield and quality of hedysarum fruticosum a dominant leguminous shrub in the desert areas of china the results showed that seed yield increased as irrigation frequency increased regardless of growth season the yearly average seed yields were 98 0 107 7 179 3 and 265 5 kg hm 2 for w0 w1 w2 and w3 irrigation respectively seed yield decreased in each subsequent growth year in all irrigation treatments and the variation in seed yield each year was the highest in w0 and lowest in w3 irrigation compared to 2019 the seed yield of w0 decreased by 47 and 66 but yields of the w3 irrigation treatment decreased by 8 and 19 in 2020 and 2021 respectively meanwhile irrigation significantly affected seed yield components the number of florets and pods per stem under the w3 irrigation treatment was two to three times that of w0 irrigation for three years the structural equation model revealed that pods per stem had the largest direct positive effect on seed yield path factor p 0 44 followed by seeds per pod path factor p 0 36 irrigation treatments affected seed germination percentage and seed size which increased as irrigations times increased a similar water use efficiency was achieved in w0 and w3 in three years and w1 treatment had the lowest water use efficiency in conclusion we recommend w3 treatment to increase seed yield and quality especially in arid regions future breeding objectives and agronomic practice for h fruticosum should pay more attention to increasing pods per stem our study can be used as a reference for taking appropriate agronomic measures to improve the seed yield of h fruticosum and similar shrubs keywords hedysarum fruticosum irrigation treatment seed quality seed yield data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hedysarum fruticosum a pioneer sand binding species is largely distributed in the shifting sand dunes of northern china zhang et al 2013 guo et al 2020 such as the tengger and badain jaran desert it has an ability of efficient regeneration through both clonal growth and seeds these two kinds of regeneration capacity especially quick clonal growth make it a good candidate to quickly restore degraded ecosystems and improve harsh environments zhang 1994 liu et al 2015 furthermore it is an excellent forage legume with high food value for livestock thereby benefiting cattle husbandry in the local region zheng et al 2005 yang et al 2010 in recent decades h fruticosum has been widely used for sand fixation and regional eco environment restoration and demand for its seeds has rapidly increased zheng et al 2003 2005 however the seeds of h fruticosum are mainly collected from natural grasslands by farmers in china and both the seed quantity and quality could not meet the requirements for ecological restoration thus limiting its utilization consequently there is a need to develop feasible approaches to improve the yield and quality of h fruticosum seeds all plants need adequate soil water to facilitate flowering pollination and seed development to improve seed yield and quality this need is exacerbated in arid regions different plants may express a range of mechanisms to address water stress successful seed production depends upon the temporal climatic pattern throughout the cropping season variability and distribution of the actual amount of precipitation received in a season and proper use of supplemental irrigation where available fairey and hampton 1998 as a result irrigation at critical reproductive growth stages may be a rational strategy to increase seed yields numerous studies breen and richards 2008 wang et al 2015 have pointed out that water availability is the main factor limiting plant growth seed yield and seed quality for example irrigation has been reported to improve seed yields of sarcobatus vermiculatus breen and richards 2008 pteronia pallen and p empetrifolia milton 1995 caragana korshinskii chen and li 2018 and potentilla tanacetifolia li et al 2011 however ronnenberg et al 2011 found that the seed yield of stipa krylovii per hectare was not affected by irrigation furthermore it is broadly accepted that water availability may influence not only the relationships between seed yield and its components but also the seeds quality and characteristics according to breen and richards 2008 regarding sarcobatus vermiculatus and the chen and li 2018 study on caragana korshinskii irrigation substantially improved seed quality likewise previous studies have shown that higher water availability had no effect on the seed mass and germination of potentilla tanacetifolia li et al 2011 and trigonella foenumgreacum bhutia and sharangi 2018 in contrast seeds that were not irrigated showed higher germination than seeds that underwent irrigated treatment for medicago sativa iannucci et al 2002 and stipa krylovii ronnenberg et al 2011 in conclusion the effect of water availability on seed yield and quality is greatly affected by the species and growth environment of the plant despite this it is crucial to maintain sustainable production and enhance the use of water resources in arid and semi arid regions various irrigation methods such as flood irrigation sprinkler irrigation and drip irrigation have been applied in the local area the characteristics of traditional flood irrigation with large amounts of water such as poor uniformity of irrigation water difficult to control water volume and large evaporation capacity in the field resulted in lower water use efficiency mitchell and van genuchten 1993 wang et al 2020 the sprinkler irrigation systems failed to ensure uniform water distribution and the application rate tends to exceed the infiltration capacity of the soil so that significant surface runoff is common in the final phases of irrigation santos et al 2003 compared with traditional flood irrigation and sprinkler irrigation drip irrigation is the most effective water saving method drip irrigation can improve irrigation efficiency by reducing evaporation from the soil surface preventing deep water leakage and enabling even application of water in fields skaggs 2001 batchelor et al 1996 wang et al 2011a thus drip irrigation system as a comprehensive agricultural water saving technology has been widely applied to seed production in arid areas kang et al 2017 wu et al 2019 in this study a three year field experiment was conducted to determine the effect of drip irrigation on the seed yield and quality of h fruticosum we also identified the main seed yield components and their contributions to seed yield the results of the experiment provided technical support for improving the seed yield of h fruticosum and similar shrubs in arid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site a field trial was carried out in the 2019 2021 growing seasons at the experimental station of lanzhou university minqin county gansu province china longitude 103 01 e latitude 38 44 n elevation 1367 m located in a typical area of the temperate continental climate the site is representative of the arid climate in northwestern china with long term averages of 116 mm annual total precipitation annual mean

rainfall and mean daily temperature data were obtained from the meteorological station at minqin county 10 km from the field plots monthly means of minimum maximum average air temperature and monthly precipitation during the experimental period 2019 2021 and the long term 1971 2021 average data were provided in fig 1 before the present study silage maize zea mays l was grown at the site for five consecutive years soil samples were taken before the study to analyze soil nutrients the available nitrogen phosphorus and potassium contents in the 0 30 cm soil layer are 25 69 15 53 and 120 68 mg kg respectively the total nitrogen content was 7 04 g kg the organic matter content was 12 19 g kg and the soil ph was 8 01 2 2 experimental design in june 2018 the experiment in a randomized block design of 16 plots measuring 3 5 3 5 m with rows spaced 1 1 m apart in each subplot were established with four treatments i e w0 non irrigated control w1 irrigation with 80 mm at winter w2 irrigation with 80 mm each at winter and regreening stage w3 irrigation with 80 mm each at winter regreening stage and peak flowering and replicated four times a total of 0 mm 80 mm 160 mm and 240 mm were applied in w0 w1 w2 and w3 treatment annually respectively in each irrigation event drip irrigation was applied water was always irrigated after 18 00 to prevent rapid evaporation to maintain treatment integrity the irrigated plots were separated from one another by 1 m walkways with rows spacing 1 1 m apart in each plot no fertilizer was applied throughout the experimental period manual weed control was used as needed during the growing seasons 2 3 data collection and calculations 2 3 1 soil moisture content the daily soil moisture content at a soil depth of 35 cm was determined using loggernet data recorders campbell scientific inc logan usa at minqin from january 2020 2022 the soil moisture content was 7 7 10 4 11 5 and 13 6 in 2020 6 2 8 3 10 6 and 12 1 in 2021 for w0 w1 w2 and w3 irrigation respectively 2 3 2 seed yield components the seed yield components considered included the number of stems per plant florets per stem fs pods per stem ps and seeds per pod spp as well as the thousand seed weight tsw at full bloom six plants were marked randomly in each plot to record the number of stems per plant fs and ps were determined for 15 undamaged stems in each plot before seed harvesting the spp was randomly recorded for 30 pods in each plant the tsw was determined after drying eight samples of 100 seeds and calculating the average in each plot 2 3 3 seed yield in late september when seeds matured seed yield was randomly determined by hand harvesting five plants in each plot the seed samples from each plant were dried threshed cleaned weighed and stored in paper bags before determining the tsw scanning the size of the seeds and conducting other laboratory analysis 2 3 4 seed quality seed quality was evaluated by standard germination germination was performed under controlled conditions in the laboratory the experiments were performed in alternating light dark 12 h 12 h white fluorescent tubes photon flux density of about 60 μmol m 2 s 1 400 700 nm condition and constant temperature regimes at 20 bai et al 2019 for each treatment four replicates of 50 seeds were incubated in 11 cm diameter petri dishes on two fold filter paper moistened with 7 ml of distilled water additional water was added as required seeds were monitored for germination every day until no further germination occurred for three consecutive days at that point any seedlings were removed at each counting seeds were regarded as having germinated when a radical of at least 2 mm long had emerged bewley and black 1994 2 3 5 water use efficiency in order to further explore the yield per unit of applied irrigation water we used the following equation to calculate the water use efficiency under different irrigation treatments wang et al 2015 cucci et al 2019 wue y i here y is the actual harvestable yield kg ha 1 i is the total amount of irrigation water and precipitation m3 ha 1 2 4 statistical analysis data processing was conducted in excel 2019 microsoft corp nm us seed yield seed yield components and wue were subjected to one way analysis of variance anova using the version 21 0 of spss spss inc chicago il usa multiple comparisons were made using duncan s multiple range test at p 0 05 correlation coefficients yield components to the seed yield was conducted in origin 2021b a structural equation model sem constructed using r was used to study how water supply affected the seed yield and yield components from 2019 to 2021 this analysis was carried out in r version 4 0 3 r core team 2020 and before the analyses all data were logarithmically transformed the sem used the lavaan function in the r package we first considered a full model that included all possible pathways and then performed model screening in r to improve the model s reliability generalized linear mixed models glmms using the glmer function in the r package lme4 were performed to investigate how two variables and their interactions affected germination in these models year and irrigation were fixed effects and replicates were a random effect seed germination was given a probability ranging from 0 to 1 so we applied a binomial estimation of the model using a logit link function we used duncan s test to compare means when significant differences were found 3 results 3 1 seed yield irrigation and year p 0 01 but not their interaction significantly influenced seed yield table 1 seed yield increased as irrigation frequency increased during the three growing seasons seed yield peaked with treatment w3 which was 292 4 268 5 and 235 5 kg ha 1 in 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively however there was no significant difference for seed yield between w2 and w3 in 2019 compared to w0 treatment w3 treatment increased seed yield by 87 222 and 336 in 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively the seed yield across all treatments showed a gradually decreasing trend as the growing year extended compared with w0 the yearly variation of seed yield declined as irrigation times increased for example seed yield of w0 treatment decreased by 47 in 2020 and 66 in 2021 over 2019 respectively while the seed yield of w3 treatment decreased by 8 in 2020 and 19 in 2021 over 2019 3 2 yield components all seed yield components p 0 01 except for stems per plant differed significantly in response to irrigation and year table 1 the number of florets per stem was significantly influenced by irrigation and year p 0 05 table 1 with an increase in irrigation florets per stem increased incrementally in three years florets per stem under w3 irrigation treatment was nearly double that in w0 treatment for each of the three years there were annual variations in florets per stem especially in irrigation treatment and florets per stem showed a gradually decreasing trend across all treatments pods per stem was significantly affected by irrigation years and interactions p 0 01 table 1 over three growing seasons the number of pods per stem gradually increased with irrigation times increased the w3 irrigation treatment resulted in 2 3 times more pods per stem than in 2019 3 times in 2020 and 1 8 times in 2021 over the no irrigation treatment w0 w2 resulted in 7 62 and 105 more pods per stem in 2019 2020 and 2021 compared with the non irrigation treatment w0 however there is no significant difference between w0 and w1 in any year the number of seeds per pod was significantly influenced by year and irrigation p 0 05 table 1 there was no significant difference among irrigation treatment in each year for seeds per pod except for in 2021 the irrigation treatment of w2 and w3 increased seeds per pod by 29 and 37 over w0 in 2021 compared to 2019 and 2020 the seeds per pod significantly decreased under the w0 and w1 treatments in 2021 thousand seed weight was significantly affected by irrigation treatments p 0 01 table 1 increased instances of irrigation tended to increase thousand seed weight although these results were neither successive nor always statistically significant for instance w3 treatment increased thousand seed weight significantly compared with other treatments in 2019 and 2020 but no significant difference was detected among the w0 w1 and w2 treatments 3 3 correlation between seed yield and yield components all yield components except for the number of stems per plant were positively associated with seed yield fig 3 the florets per stem seeds per pod and thousand seed weight show significant positive correlation with pods per stem the number of stems per plant florets per stem and pods per stem also showed significant positive correlation with seeds per pod 3 4 the contribution of yield components to seed yield overall the initial sem adequately fit the data χ2 5 92 df 6 cfi 1 it showed that irrigation treatment and seed yield components jointly explained 75 of the variation in seed yield the final model explained 76 45 29 and 28 of variation in pods per stem florets per stem thousand seed weight and seeds per pod respectively the sem results showed that irrigation treatment directly or indirectly influence seed yield through four ways fig 4 increasing irrigation directly increased seed yield increasing irrigation also indirectly increased the seed yield by directly increasing florets per stem and pods per stem increasing irrigation increased thousand seed weight and this yield component did not show significant correlations with the seed yield irrigation had a positive effect on seeds per pod which then positively affected the seed yield 3 5 seed quality irrigation years and their interaction all had significant effects on seed germination p 0 05 table 2 seed germination increased as irrigation increased for example seeds from the w3 had higher germination than all other treatments except in 2020 however differences with w1 2021 and w2 2019 2021 not significant w3 irrigation treatment increased germination percentage by 42 and 58 compared to w0 treatment in 2019 and 2021 however there was no significant difference between irrigation treatments regarding germination percentage in 2020 years but not irrigation had significant effects on t50 p 0 05 table 2 for example t50 in 2020 was significantly lower than that in 2021 seed germination percentage and t50 varied year to year and the poor seed quality recorded in 2019 was evident under all treatments irrigation and year p 0 05 table 2 but not their interaction brings different effect on seed size the seed size shows an increasing trend with the irrigation increased for example irrigation treatment increased seed area by 5 3 19 0 2 5 18 0 and 0 2 8 9 seed length increased by 1 6 6 9 1 2 8 0 and 1 0 6 6 and seed width increased by 0 8 8 5 1 6 11 6 and 2 2 6 6 compared to non irrigated treatments in 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively 3 6 water use efficiency for seed production the wue was significantly affected by irrigation and year p 0 01 but no interaction was detected table 3 wue initially decreased and then increased with the increasing of irrigation for three years the wue was the lowest under w1 treatment at 0 58 kg m 3 while w0 treatment had the highest wue at 0 94 kg m 3 followed by w3 treatment at 0 79 kg m 3 the value of water use efficiency ranged from 0 84 to 1 24 0 61 1 04 and 0 29 0 69 kg m 3 during 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively as the growth year extending wue decreased regardless of irrigation treatment the value of water use efficiency measured at 0 96 0 79 and 0 51 kg m 3 during 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively different capital letters and small letters indicate significant differences among years and irrigation treatments at the 0 05 level 4 discussion 4 1 irrigation effect on seed yield and yield component assessing the results from different treatments shows that increasing irrigation to its entire level has increased the yield this result aligns with those of studies in sarcobatus vermiculatus breen and richards 2008 and stylosanthes scabra mcdonald and jones 2002 much of this increase in yields can be attributed to irrigation which encouraged plant growth and development further irrigation significantly enhanced fs and ps correlation analysis showed that fs and ps were positively correlated with seed yield the sem also verified that ps and fs contributed the most to sy and tsw and spp affected sy to a lesser degree these results suggest that ps and fs should be the preferred traits in breeding programs of h fruticosum aimed at obtaining high sy breen and richards 2008 found that the total number of seeds produced per plant and seed weight increased significantly under the irrigation treatment of sarcobatus vermiculatus guo et al 2007 reported irrigation significantly increased the fertile shoots per plant racemes per plant and pods per raceme of lucerne which contributed to higher seed yield however wang et al 2015 found that water availability affected the mean seed yield by increasing the seed size of atriplex aucheri iannucci et al 2002 reported that yield was strongly determined by the stem density component with less emphasis on contributions from other yield components the inconsistent responses of seed yield to water availability may be caused by the different species in each study and their growth environmental conditions the irrigation stage plays a key role in seed yield in our study irrigation before winter w1 did not increase seed yield in 2019 or 2021 this may be because the poor water retention capacity of sandy soil would lead to rapid water loss during winter and contribute less to growth in the spring ma et al 2019 this is supported by our data on moisture monitoring at the experimental site the highest seed yield was found in w3 irrigation but there were no statistically significant differences in seed yield between w2 and w3 irrigation in the first wet year because adequate precipitation during the growing season met the plants reproductive and developmental needs when water limitation occurs during the reproductive stage especially anthesis rates of flower sterility and seed hollowness are considerably increased selote and khanna chopra 2004 as shown in table 1 ps increased under w3 irrigation compared to w0 w1 and w2 drought had little effect on fs but it led to a significant decrease in the ps and pod bearing percentage the low soil water content caused by drought reduced the photosynthetic rate and the accumulation of photosynthetic products was affected this in turn affected the differentiation process of flower buds resulting in the formation of a large number of incomplete flowers thereby reducing the quality of flower pollination and the pod bearing percentage luo et al 2009 chen and li 2018 the productivity of the h fruticosum tested showed significant variations according to the different weather conditions in the three trial years we observed yearly fluctuation of seed yield the seed yield in 2019 was higher than that in 2020 and 2021 table 1 koutroubas et al 2009 found that more rainfall and higher temperatures during the reproductive stage negatively affected fs and ps reducing seed yield under continental climatic conditions in our experiment the growing season of 2019 especially during the florescence initiation and flowering period in july was characterized by a lower temperature than the same period in 2020 and 2021 fig 1 similarly research showed that reductions in the amount of rainfall usually limit plant growth and or seed production in arid and semiarid ecosystems volis et al 2015 mojzes et al 2018 in this study the growing season of 2019 104 4 mm was characterized by much more rainfall than 2020 74 2 mm and 2021 82 5 mm fig 1 the higher precipitation was likely responsible for the increase of seed yield in 2019 this result also parallels the findings of tao et al 2019 who suggested that more rainfall during the growing season was beneficial for high seed yield of artemisia sphaerocephala the rainfall was higher in 2019 and the seed yield difference between treatments was less obvious than that in 2020 and 2021 at the same time there was no significant difference in seed yield between w2 184 4 mm and w3 244 4 mm irrigation treatment in addition the average soil water content decreased with the year increasing it could be the case that the plant s age is important because most perennial plants do not set seed in the establishment season and may have reduced fecundity when approaching their terminal age harper 1977 mcdonald and jones 2002 alternatively the high density and long term cultivation of h fruticosum may significantly reduce deep soil water content and this water deficit may be difficult to recover ali et al 2021 4 2 seed quality water availability plays a major role in the regulation of seed development bradford 1994 several studies have found that irrigation could increase seed size and enhance seed germination akhalkatsi and lösch 2005 breen and richards 2008 wang et al 2015 similarly our results clearly showed that irrigation increased seed germination and size except for in 2020 on the one hand more water is beneficial for photosynthesis and creates more biomass boyer 1976 hussain et al 2018 which increases seed size on the other hand large seeds may germinate at higher percentages than small seeds tripathi and khan 1990 moles et al 2000 khan and shankar 2001 however walter et al 2016 found that the effects of water supply on germination rate were less evident but drought stress accelerated germination at differing rates between dwarf shrub species genista tinctoria and calluna vulgaris according to the results reported on alfalfa and clover species steiner 1993 and on soybeans vieira et al 1992 plants grown under different water availability conditions have similar germination percentages however other studies tielbörger and valleriani 2005 germain et al 2013 showed that moist maternal conditions decreased germination as compared to dry conditions the different response of seed quality to water supply may be caused by the differing water demands of various species and moisture conditions walter et al 2016 baskin and baskin 2014 fenner and thompson 2005 generally water is an important factor affecting plant photosynthesis and seed development in arid regions turner and stewart 1986 nevertheless excessive water may lead more photosynthate to allocate for vegetative growth rather than for the accumulation of seed nutrients and thus was not conducive to seed reproduction sau and mı nguez 2000 similarly a humid environment is not beneficial for seed maturation and dehydration thus reducing the quality of seeds olivares et al 2009 it is mainly related to the water demand of different species and environmental conditions although irrigation have been found increased seed germination and size in our study it is also worth noting that the poorest seed quality was recorded in the wettest year 2019 under all treatments this may be explained by the divergent effect of rainfall which is highly dependent on the season saarinen et al 2011 generally a wet environmental condition during seed maturation would reduce seed quality indeed plants received much more precipitation in 2019 28 7 mm than that in 2020 19 3 mm and 2021 16 5 mm during maturation and seed development in our study this is consistent with previous study in ifloga spicata rumex pictus and senecio glaucus in which seed harvested in dry years had a higher germination percentage than that in wet years tielbörger and valleriani 2005 4 3 water use efficiency some studies found that wue tends to increase dong et al 2011 efetha et al 2011 jin et al 2018 but others found that wue decreased as irrigation increased ismail amd almarshadi 2013 ali et al 2018 ismail and el nakhlawy 2018 eissa et al 2018 our result indicated that wue initially decreased and then increased with an increase in irrigation under natural drought conditions it is possible for plants to maximize their use of water for reproduction aronson et al 1993 thereby increasing wue however increasing irrigation from w1 to w2 favored overwintering and growth of h fruticosum ma et al 2019 and the plant s water status was not significantly changed during seed development and maturation therefore the increases in seed yield may not be synchronized with increase the amount of water which could result in low wue furthermore w3 irrigation improved water availability throughout the growth period and seed yield therefore the production per unit of water increased and wue increased as a result zhang et al 1998 deng et al 2006 this implies that irrigation during the flowering period is critical for improving seed yield and wue huettig et al 2013 tao et al 2021 the next step should determine and apply appropriate irrigation amounts during this period remarkably yearly variation of wue declined with decreasing soil moisture content as mentioned before long term cultivation of deep rooted plants leads to soil water deficit besides water use characteristics vary with climatic conditions dacosta and huang 2006 but the spatial patterns of wue were generally consistent with those of yield i e high yield was accompanied by high wue and vice versa jin et al 2018 5 conclusion in brief our results clearly showed that irrigation significantly increased the seed yield and quality of h fruticosum the highest irrigation treatment also exhibited a higher wue than other irrigation treatments these results suggest that irrigation may be a practical way to increase the seed supply of h fruticosum either from improved seed yield or increased wue however the present study only considered the influence of irrigation frequency determining how to optimize the interaction of irrigation period and irrigation amount could be a key step in improving the seed yield and wue of h fruticosum furthermore seed yield varied considerably by year in our study so how to best maintain the stability of yield and quality improvements under irrigation conditions should be further investigated

9073,shortage of high quality seeds of native species particularly for xerophyte shrubs have severely limited grassland restoration in the arid region of china however little attention has been devoted to improving seed yield and quality in the xerophyte shrub we conducted a three year field experiment from 2019 to 2020 to investigate the effects of four irrigation treatments i e w0 non irrigated control w1 irrigation at winter w2 irrigation at winter and regreening w3 irrigation at winter regreening and peak flowering via subsurface drip irrigation on the seed yield and quality of hedysarum fruticosum a dominant leguminous shrub in the desert areas of china the results showed that seed yield increased as irrigation frequency increased regardless of growth season the yearly average seed yields were 98 0 107 7 179 3 and 265 5 kg hm 2 for w0 w1 w2 and w3 irrigation respectively seed yield decreased in each subsequent growth year in all irrigation treatments and the variation in seed yield each year was the highest in w0 and lowest in w3 irrigation compared to 2019 the seed yield of w0 decreased by 47 and 66 but yields of the w3 irrigation treatment decreased by 8 and 19 in 2020 and 2021 respectively meanwhile irrigation significantly affected seed yield components the number of florets and pods per stem under the w3 irrigation treatment was two to three times that of w0 irrigation for three years the structural equation model revealed that pods per stem had the largest direct positive effect on seed yield path factor p 0 44 followed by seeds per pod path factor p 0 36 irrigation treatments affected seed germination percentage and seed size which increased as irrigations times increased a similar water use efficiency was achieved in w0 and w3 in three years and w1 treatment had the lowest water use efficiency in conclusion we recommend w3 treatment to increase seed yield and quality especially in arid regions future breeding objectives and agronomic practice for h fruticosum should pay more attention to increasing pods per stem our study can be used as a reference for taking appropriate agronomic measures to improve the seed yield of h fruticosum and similar shrubs keywords hedysarum fruticosum irrigation treatment seed quality seed yield data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hedysarum fruticosum a pioneer sand binding species is largely distributed in the shifting sand dunes of northern china zhang et al 2013 guo et al 2020 such as the tengger and badain jaran desert it has an ability of efficient regeneration through both clonal growth and seeds these two kinds of regeneration capacity especially quick clonal growth make it a good candidate to quickly restore degraded ecosystems and improve harsh environments zhang 1994 liu et al 2015 furthermore it is an excellent forage legume with high food value for livestock thereby benefiting cattle husbandry in the local region zheng et al 2005 yang et al 2010 in recent decades h fruticosum has been widely used for sand fixation and regional eco environment restoration and demand for its seeds has rapidly increased zheng et al 2003 2005 however the seeds of h fruticosum are mainly collected from natural grasslands by farmers in china and both the seed quantity and quality could not meet the requirements for ecological restoration thus limiting its utilization consequently there is a need to develop feasible approaches to improve the yield and quality of h fruticosum seeds all plants need adequate soil water to facilitate flowering pollination and seed development to improve seed yield and quality this need is exacerbated in arid regions different plants may express a range of mechanisms to address water stress successful seed production depends upon the temporal climatic pattern throughout the cropping season variability and distribution of the actual amount of precipitation received in a season and proper use of supplemental irrigation where available fairey and hampton 1998 as a result irrigation at critical reproductive growth stages may be a rational strategy to increase seed yields numerous studies breen and richards 2008 wang et al 2015 have pointed out that water availability is the main factor limiting plant growth seed yield and seed quality for example irrigation has been reported to improve seed yields of sarcobatus vermiculatus breen and richards 2008 pteronia pallen and p empetrifolia milton 1995 caragana korshinskii chen and li 2018 and potentilla tanacetifolia li et al 2011 however ronnenberg et al 2011 found that the seed yield of stipa krylovii per hectare was not affected by irrigation furthermore it is broadly accepted that water availability may influence not only the relationships between seed yield and its components but also the seeds quality and characteristics according to breen and richards 2008 regarding sarcobatus vermiculatus and the chen and li 2018 study on caragana korshinskii irrigation substantially improved seed quality likewise previous studies have shown that higher water availability had no effect on the seed mass and germination of potentilla tanacetifolia li et al 2011 and trigonella foenumgreacum bhutia and sharangi 2018 in contrast seeds that were not irrigated showed higher germination than seeds that underwent irrigated treatment for medicago sativa iannucci et al 2002 and stipa krylovii ronnenberg et al 2011 in conclusion the effect of water availability on seed yield and quality is greatly affected by the species and growth environment of the plant despite this it is crucial to maintain sustainable production and enhance the use of water resources in arid and semi arid regions various irrigation methods such as flood irrigation sprinkler irrigation and drip irrigation have been applied in the local area the characteristics of traditional flood irrigation with large amounts of water such as poor uniformity of irrigation water difficult to control water volume and large evaporation capacity in the field resulted in lower water use efficiency mitchell and van genuchten 1993 wang et al 2020 the sprinkler irrigation systems failed to ensure uniform water distribution and the application rate tends to exceed the infiltration capacity of the soil so that significant surface runoff is common in the final phases of irrigation santos et al 2003 compared with traditional flood irrigation and sprinkler irrigation drip irrigation is the most effective water saving method drip irrigation can improve irrigation efficiency by reducing evaporation from the soil surface preventing deep water leakage and enabling even application of water in fields skaggs 2001 batchelor et al 1996 wang et al 2011a thus drip irrigation system as a comprehensive agricultural water saving technology has been widely applied to seed production in arid areas kang et al 2017 wu et al 2019 in this study a three year field experiment was conducted to determine the effect of drip irrigation on the seed yield and quality of h fruticosum we also identified the main seed yield components and their contributions to seed yield the results of the experiment provided technical support for improving the seed yield of h fruticosum and similar shrubs in arid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site a field trial was carried out in the 2019 2021 growing seasons at the experimental station of lanzhou university minqin county gansu province china longitude 103 01 e latitude 38 44 n elevation 1367 m located in a typical area of the temperate continental climate the site is representative of the arid climate in northwestern china with long term averages of 116 mm annual total precipitation annual mean

rainfall and mean daily temperature data were obtained from the meteorological station at minqin county 10 km from the field plots monthly means of minimum maximum average air temperature and monthly precipitation during the experimental period 2019 2021 and the long term 1971 2021 average data were provided in fig 1 before the present study silage maize zea mays l was grown at the site for five consecutive years soil samples were taken before the study to analyze soil nutrients the available nitrogen phosphorus and potassium contents in the 0 30 cm soil layer are 25 69 15 53 and 120 68 mg kg respectively the total nitrogen content was 7 04 g kg the organic matter content was 12 19 g kg and the soil ph was 8 01 2 2 experimental design in june 2018 the experiment in a randomized block design of 16 plots measuring 3 5 3 5 m with rows spaced 1 1 m apart in each subplot were established with four treatments i e w0 non irrigated control w1 irrigation with 80 mm at winter w2 irrigation with 80 mm each at winter and regreening stage w3 irrigation with 80 mm each at winter regreening stage and peak flowering and replicated four times a total of 0 mm 80 mm 160 mm and 240 mm were applied in w0 w1 w2 and w3 treatment annually respectively in each irrigation event drip irrigation was applied water was always irrigated after 18 00 to prevent rapid evaporation to maintain treatment integrity the irrigated plots were separated from one another by 1 m walkways with rows spacing 1 1 m apart in each plot no fertilizer was applied throughout the experimental period manual weed control was used as needed during the growing seasons 2 3 data collection and calculations 2 3 1 soil moisture content the daily soil moisture content at a soil depth of 35 cm was determined using loggernet data recorders campbell scientific inc logan usa at minqin from january 2020 2022 the soil moisture content was 7 7 10 4 11 5 and 13 6 in 2020 6 2 8 3 10 6 and 12 1 in 2021 for w0 w1 w2 and w3 irrigation respectively 2 3 2 seed yield components the seed yield components considered included the number of stems per plant florets per stem fs pods per stem ps and seeds per pod spp as well as the thousand seed weight tsw at full bloom six plants were marked randomly in each plot to record the number of stems per plant fs and ps were determined for 15 undamaged stems in each plot before seed harvesting the spp was randomly recorded for 30 pods in each plant the tsw was determined after drying eight samples of 100 seeds and calculating the average in each plot 2 3 3 seed yield in late september when seeds matured seed yield was randomly determined by hand harvesting five plants in each plot the seed samples from each plant were dried threshed cleaned weighed and stored in paper bags before determining the tsw scanning the size of the seeds and conducting other laboratory analysis 2 3 4 seed quality seed quality was evaluated by standard germination germination was performed under controlled conditions in the laboratory the experiments were performed in alternating light dark 12 h 12 h white fluorescent tubes photon flux density of about 60 μmol m 2 s 1 400 700 nm condition and constant temperature regimes at 20 bai et al 2019 for each treatment four replicates of 50 seeds were incubated in 11 cm diameter petri dishes on two fold filter paper moistened with 7 ml of distilled water additional water was added as required seeds were monitored for germination every day until no further germination occurred for three consecutive days at that point any seedlings were removed at each counting seeds were regarded as having germinated when a radical of at least 2 mm long had emerged bewley and black 1994 2 3 5 water use efficiency in order to further explore the yield per unit of applied irrigation water we used the following equation to calculate the water use efficiency under different irrigation treatments wang et al 2015 cucci et al 2019 wue y i here y is the actual harvestable yield kg ha 1 i is the total amount of irrigation water and precipitation m3 ha 1 2 4 statistical analysis data processing was conducted in excel 2019 microsoft corp nm us seed yield seed yield components and wue were subjected to one way analysis of variance anova using the version 21 0 of spss spss inc chicago il usa multiple comparisons were made using duncan s multiple range test at p 0 05 correlation coefficients yield components to the seed yield was conducted in origin 2021b a structural equation model sem constructed using r was used to study how water supply affected the seed yield and yield components from 2019 to 2021 this analysis was carried out in r version 4 0 3 r core team 2020 and before the analyses all data were logarithmically transformed the sem used the lavaan function in the r package we first considered a full model that included all possible pathways and then performed model screening in r to improve the model s reliability generalized linear mixed models glmms using the glmer function in the r package lme4 were performed to investigate how two variables and their interactions affected germination in these models year and irrigation were fixed effects and replicates were a random effect seed germination was given a probability ranging from 0 to 1 so we applied a binomial estimation of the model using a logit link function we used duncan s test to compare means when significant differences were found 3 results 3 1 seed yield irrigation and year p 0 01 but not their interaction significantly influenced seed yield table 1 seed yield increased as irrigation frequency increased during the three growing seasons seed yield peaked with treatment w3 which was 292 4 268 5 and 235 5 kg ha 1 in 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively however there was no significant difference for seed yield between w2 and w3 in 2019 compared to w0 treatment w3 treatment increased seed yield by 87 222 and 336 in 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively the seed yield across all treatments showed a gradually decreasing trend as the growing year extended compared with w0 the yearly variation of seed yield declined as irrigation times increased for example seed yield of w0 treatment decreased by 47 in 2020 and 66 in 2021 over 2019 respectively while the seed yield of w3 treatment decreased by 8 in 2020 and 19 in 2021 over 2019 3 2 yield components all seed yield components p 0 01 except for stems per plant differed significantly in response to irrigation and year table 1 the number of florets per stem was significantly influenced by irrigation and year p 0 05 table 1 with an increase in irrigation florets per stem increased incrementally in three years florets per stem under w3 irrigation treatment was nearly double that in w0 treatment for each of the three years there were annual variations in florets per stem especially in irrigation treatment and florets per stem showed a gradually decreasing trend across all treatments pods per stem was significantly affected by irrigation years and interactions p 0 01 table 1 over three growing seasons the number of pods per stem gradually increased with irrigation times increased the w3 irrigation treatment resulted in 2 3 times more pods per stem than in 2019 3 times in 2020 and 1 8 times in 2021 over the no irrigation treatment w0 w2 resulted in 7 62 and 105 more pods per stem in 2019 2020 and 2021 compared with the non irrigation treatment w0 however there is no significant difference between w0 and w1 in any year the number of seeds per pod was significantly influenced by year and irrigation p 0 05 table 1 there was no significant difference among irrigation treatment in each year for seeds per pod except for in 2021 the irrigation treatment of w2 and w3 increased seeds per pod by 29 and 37 over w0 in 2021 compared to 2019 and 2020 the seeds per pod significantly decreased under the w0 and w1 treatments in 2021 thousand seed weight was significantly affected by irrigation treatments p 0 01 table 1 increased instances of irrigation tended to increase thousand seed weight although these results were neither successive nor always statistically significant for instance w3 treatment increased thousand seed weight significantly compared with other treatments in 2019 and 2020 but no significant difference was detected among the w0 w1 and w2 treatments 3 3 correlation between seed yield and yield components all yield components except for the number of stems per plant were positively associated with seed yield fig 3 the florets per stem seeds per pod and thousand seed weight show significant positive correlation with pods per stem the number of stems per plant florets per stem and pods per stem also showed significant positive correlation with seeds per pod 3 4 the contribution of yield components to seed yield overall the initial sem adequately fit the data χ2 5 92 df 6 cfi 1 it showed that irrigation treatment and seed yield components jointly explained 75 of the variation in seed yield the final model explained 76 45 29 and 28 of variation in pods per stem florets per stem thousand seed weight and seeds per pod respectively the sem results showed that irrigation treatment directly or indirectly influence seed yield through four ways fig 4 increasing irrigation directly increased seed yield increasing irrigation also indirectly increased the seed yield by directly increasing florets per stem and pods per stem increasing irrigation increased thousand seed weight and this yield component did not show significant correlations with the seed yield irrigation had a positive effect on seeds per pod which then positively affected the seed yield 3 5 seed quality irrigation years and their interaction all had significant effects on seed germination p 0 05 table 2 seed germination increased as irrigation increased for example seeds from the w3 had higher germination than all other treatments except in 2020 however differences with w1 2021 and w2 2019 2021 not significant w3 irrigation treatment increased germination percentage by 42 and 58 compared to w0 treatment in 2019 and 2021 however there was no significant difference between irrigation treatments regarding germination percentage in 2020 years but not irrigation had significant effects on t50 p 0 05 table 2 for example t50 in 2020 was significantly lower than that in 2021 seed germination percentage and t50 varied year to year and the poor seed quality recorded in 2019 was evident under all treatments irrigation and year p 0 05 table 2 but not their interaction brings different effect on seed size the seed size shows an increasing trend with the irrigation increased for example irrigation treatment increased seed area by 5 3 19 0 2 5 18 0 and 0 2 8 9 seed length increased by 1 6 6 9 1 2 8 0 and 1 0 6 6 and seed width increased by 0 8 8 5 1 6 11 6 and 2 2 6 6 compared to non irrigated treatments in 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively 3 6 water use efficiency for seed production the wue was significantly affected by irrigation and year p 0 01 but no interaction was detected table 3 wue initially decreased and then increased with the increasing of irrigation for three years the wue was the lowest under w1 treatment at 0 58 kg m 3 while w0 treatment had the highest wue at 0 94 kg m 3 followed by w3 treatment at 0 79 kg m 3 the value of water use efficiency ranged from 0 84 to 1 24 0 61 1 04 and 0 29 0 69 kg m 3 during 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively as the growth year extending wue decreased regardless of irrigation treatment the value of water use efficiency measured at 0 96 0 79 and 0 51 kg m 3 during 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively different capital letters and small letters indicate significant differences among years and irrigation treatments at the 0 05 level 4 discussion 4 1 irrigation effect on seed yield and yield component assessing the results from different treatments shows that increasing irrigation to its entire level has increased the yield this result aligns with those of studies in sarcobatus vermiculatus breen and richards 2008 and stylosanthes scabra mcdonald and jones 2002 much of this increase in yields can be attributed to irrigation which encouraged plant growth and development further irrigation significantly enhanced fs and ps correlation analysis showed that fs and ps were positively correlated with seed yield the sem also verified that ps and fs contributed the most to sy and tsw and spp affected sy to a lesser degree these results suggest that ps and fs should be the preferred traits in breeding programs of h fruticosum aimed at obtaining high sy breen and richards 2008 found that the total number of seeds produced per plant and seed weight increased significantly under the irrigation treatment of sarcobatus vermiculatus guo et al 2007 reported irrigation significantly increased the fertile shoots per plant racemes per plant and pods per raceme of lucerne which contributed to higher seed yield however wang et al 2015 found that water availability affected the mean seed yield by increasing the seed size of atriplex aucheri iannucci et al 2002 reported that yield was strongly determined by the stem density component with less emphasis on contributions from other yield components the inconsistent responses of seed yield to water availability may be caused by the different species in each study and their growth environmental conditions the irrigation stage plays a key role in seed yield in our study irrigation before winter w1 did not increase seed yield in 2019 or 2021 this may be because the poor water retention capacity of sandy soil would lead to rapid water loss during winter and contribute less to growth in the spring ma et al 2019 this is supported by our data on moisture monitoring at the experimental site the highest seed yield was found in w3 irrigation but there were no statistically significant differences in seed yield between w2 and w3 irrigation in the first wet year because adequate precipitation during the growing season met the plants reproductive and developmental needs when water limitation occurs during the reproductive stage especially anthesis rates of flower sterility and seed hollowness are considerably increased selote and khanna chopra 2004 as shown in table 1 ps increased under w3 irrigation compared to w0 w1 and w2 drought had little effect on fs but it led to a significant decrease in the ps and pod bearing percentage the low soil water content caused by drought reduced the photosynthetic rate and the accumulation of photosynthetic products was affected this in turn affected the differentiation process of flower buds resulting in the formation of a large number of incomplete flowers thereby reducing the quality of flower pollination and the pod bearing percentage luo et al 2009 chen and li 2018 the productivity of the h fruticosum tested showed significant variations according to the different weather conditions in the three trial years we observed yearly fluctuation of seed yield the seed yield in 2019 was higher than that in 2020 and 2021 table 1 koutroubas et al 2009 found that more rainfall and higher temperatures during the reproductive stage negatively affected fs and ps reducing seed yield under continental climatic conditions in our experiment the growing season of 2019 especially during the florescence initiation and flowering period in july was characterized by a lower temperature than the same period in 2020 and 2021 fig 1 similarly research showed that reductions in the amount of rainfall usually limit plant growth and or seed production in arid and semiarid ecosystems volis et al 2015 mojzes et al 2018 in this study the growing season of 2019 104 4 mm was characterized by much more rainfall than 2020 74 2 mm and 2021 82 5 mm fig 1 the higher precipitation was likely responsible for the increase of seed yield in 2019 this result also parallels the findings of tao et al 2019 who suggested that more rainfall during the growing season was beneficial for high seed yield of artemisia sphaerocephala the rainfall was higher in 2019 and the seed yield difference between treatments was less obvious than that in 2020 and 2021 at the same time there was no significant difference in seed yield between w2 184 4 mm and w3 244 4 mm irrigation treatment in addition the average soil water content decreased with the year increasing it could be the case that the plant s age is important because most perennial plants do not set seed in the establishment season and may have reduced fecundity when approaching their terminal age harper 1977 mcdonald and jones 2002 alternatively the high density and long term cultivation of h fruticosum may significantly reduce deep soil water content and this water deficit may be difficult to recover ali et al 2021 4 2 seed quality water availability plays a major role in the regulation of seed development bradford 1994 several studies have found that irrigation could increase seed size and enhance seed germination akhalkatsi and lösch 2005 breen and richards 2008 wang et al 2015 similarly our results clearly showed that irrigation increased seed germination and size except for in 2020 on the one hand more water is beneficial for photosynthesis and creates more biomass boyer 1976 hussain et al 2018 which increases seed size on the other hand large seeds may germinate at higher percentages than small seeds tripathi and khan 1990 moles et al 2000 khan and shankar 2001 however walter et al 2016 found that the effects of water supply on germination rate were less evident but drought stress accelerated germination at differing rates between dwarf shrub species genista tinctoria and calluna vulgaris according to the results reported on alfalfa and clover species steiner 1993 and on soybeans vieira et al 1992 plants grown under different water availability conditions have similar germination percentages however other studies tielbörger and valleriani 2005 germain et al 2013 showed that moist maternal conditions decreased germination as compared to dry conditions the different response of seed quality to water supply may be caused by the differing water demands of various species and moisture conditions walter et al 2016 baskin and baskin 2014 fenner and thompson 2005 generally water is an important factor affecting plant photosynthesis and seed development in arid regions turner and stewart 1986 nevertheless excessive water may lead more photosynthate to allocate for vegetative growth rather than for the accumulation of seed nutrients and thus was not conducive to seed reproduction sau and mı nguez 2000 similarly a humid environment is not beneficial for seed maturation and dehydration thus reducing the quality of seeds olivares et al 2009 it is mainly related to the water demand of different species and environmental conditions although irrigation have been found increased seed germination and size in our study it is also worth noting that the poorest seed quality was recorded in the wettest year 2019 under all treatments this may be explained by the divergent effect of rainfall which is highly dependent on the season saarinen et al 2011 generally a wet environmental condition during seed maturation would reduce seed quality indeed plants received much more precipitation in 2019 28 7 mm than that in 2020 19 3 mm and 2021 16 5 mm during maturation and seed development in our study this is consistent with previous study in ifloga spicata rumex pictus and senecio glaucus in which seed harvested in dry years had a higher germination percentage than that in wet years tielbörger and valleriani 2005 4 3 water use efficiency some studies found that wue tends to increase dong et al 2011 efetha et al 2011 jin et al 2018 but others found that wue decreased as irrigation increased ismail amd almarshadi 2013 ali et al 2018 ismail and el nakhlawy 2018 eissa et al 2018 our result indicated that wue initially decreased and then increased with an increase in irrigation under natural drought conditions it is possible for plants to maximize their use of water for reproduction aronson et al 1993 thereby increasing wue however increasing irrigation from w1 to w2 favored overwintering and growth of h fruticosum ma et al 2019 and the plant s water status was not significantly changed during seed development and maturation therefore the increases in seed yield may not be synchronized with increase the amount of water which could result in low wue furthermore w3 irrigation improved water availability throughout the growth period and seed yield therefore the production per unit of water increased and wue increased as a result zhang et al 1998 deng et al 2006 this implies that irrigation during the flowering period is critical for improving seed yield and wue huettig et al 2013 tao et al 2021 the next step should determine and apply appropriate irrigation amounts during this period remarkably yearly variation of wue declined with decreasing soil moisture content as mentioned before long term cultivation of deep rooted plants leads to soil water deficit besides water use characteristics vary with climatic conditions dacosta and huang 2006 but the spatial patterns of wue were generally consistent with those of yield i e high yield was accompanied by high wue and vice versa jin et al 2018 5 conclusion in brief our results clearly showed that irrigation significantly increased the seed yield and quality of h fruticosum the highest irrigation treatment also exhibited a higher wue than other irrigation treatments these results suggest that irrigation may be a practical way to increase the seed supply of h fruticosum either from improved seed yield or increased wue however the present study only considered the influence of irrigation frequency determining how to optimize the interaction of irrigation period and irrigation amount could be a key step in improving the seed yield and wue of h fruticosum furthermore seed yield varied considerably by year in our study so how to best maintain the stability of yield and quality improvements under irrigation conditions should be further investigated

9074,the applicability of soil and water assessment tool swat for rainfall runoff modelling in the river reservoir integrated catchment command areas is limited due to the limited description of paddy field dynamics to model the dominant paddy field hydrology in most of the catchments of asian countries with tropical monsoon type climatology the popular swat couples a pothole module in place of the conventional curve number cn approach although few pothole approaches are existing in the literature the efficacy of these modules have not been evaluated for catchment scale applications moreover the existing pothole modules are more conceptual in nature with many calibration parameters that could yield erroneous outcomes in catchment scale applications to address these issues the applicability of the pothole module was assesses and evaluated in a 12 014 70 km2 river catchment reservoir command iof eastern india the simulation results reveal that for streamflow generation the revised pothole approach performed the best with the nse of 0 62 followed by the cn approach nse 0 60 and the original pothole approach nse 0 59 the water balance analysis resulted small evapotranspiration et values 0 01 mm day for the cn approach and existing approach based model simulation the daily streamflow prediction uncertainty was the highest in case of existing pothole approach with r factor estimate of 0 73 followed by 0 58 and 0 56 in case of cn approach and revised pothole approach respectively overall the cn approach performs better in case of rain fed paddy field whereas the revised pothole approach simulates the daily scale streamflow better in the irrigated paddy conditions keywords paddy field pothole swat uncertainty analysis water balance data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction streamflow assessment under varying topographic land use and climatic condition is an integral component of policy implementation for management of flood hazards ravazzani et al 2015 irrigation water application ramireddygari et al 2000 appraisal of environmental flow requirement karimi et al 2012 and hydropower generation wagner et al 2017 the catchment scale estimation of streamflow in paddy dominant agricultural watershed is confined to water balance approaches khepar et al 2000 and physically based approaches refsgaard and storm 1995 arnold et al 1998 the conceptualization of water balance approaches is based on numerous calibration parameters however upon characterizing complex hydrological phenomena with the help of simple co efficient fails to capture the actual dynamics of the paddy field hydrology the process based models like soil and water assessment tool swat and système hydrologique européen mike she simulated the surface and sub surface hydrology of paddy fields by means of the model numeric conceptualizations across the south east asia regions dash et al 2023 im et al 2007 padhiary et al 2020 the mike she simulates the paddy field streamflow generation process by means of five crop specific parameters viz in the simulation of actual evapotranspiration c1 c2 cint and a time series for leaf area index lai and root distribution function rdf from the swat database the swat is river basin scale continuous time scale model capable of simulating the streamflow sediment yield and loading from non point sources under varying environmental and climatic scenarios dash et al 2021 the potential of swat to account for agricultural management practices soil conservation practices and water retention structures including ponds and reservoirs have evolved it to a more robust and flexible modelling alternative under varying environmental and lulc conditions gassman et al 2022 dash et al 2019 in south eastern part of the asian regions the agricultural catchments are cultivated with paddy crops during both the rainy monsoon and dry lean periods with pre dominant ponding and non ponding conditions sakaguchi et al 2014 the behaviour of the paddy fields under the presence of standing water and recurrent irrigation application during the paddy cultivation makes the swat based hydrological modeling more cumbersome this led to the development of an embedded pothole module for exclusive modeling of the paddy field hydrology under alternate wetting and drying condition du et al 2005 the very first pothole variant was developed with an intent to model an agricultural field cultivated with corn soybean and characterized by great number of potholes caused due to poor drainage the pothole module underlined three primary hydrological process components tile flow under sub surface drainage condition water table fluctuation and role of pothole topography on streamflow simulation in river basin scale applications fig 1 however water retention and water ponding aspect lead to the adoption of the pothole module in paddy dominant agricultural watersheds for realistic representation of rice field kang et al 2006 xie et al 2011 boulange et al 2014 the pothole module in swat was modified to understand the evapotranspiration et loss during both the ponding and drainage soil condition xie and cui 2011 the evaporation loss was presumed to occur from the standing water surface and soil surface during ponded condition and drainage condition respectively the water stress condition inside the pothole was ascertained by a threshold ponding water level as defined by guo 1997 and subsequent amount of irrigation water was triggered while developing a total maximum daily load programme kang et al 2006 characterized the daily percolation rates of paddy field under saturated condition by assigning a fixed percolation rate value to specific soil classes in swat pothole module this attempt completely ignored the soil moisture movement under saturated soil condition and lacked the dynamism in sub surface hydrological processes a coupled pcpf 1 swat was developed to estimate catchment scale pesticide concentration in surface soil and streamflow generated from paddy field tu et al 2018 the modified swat pothole model incorporated the lateral seepage through the bunds during the computation of paddy field water balance sakaguchi et al 2014 showed the in adequacy of pothole module in simulating paddy field water balance dynamics and implemented significant improvements to the existing pothole module a term potential percolation rate was introduced which combinedly account for the lateral seepage through embankment and vertical percolation taking place inside the paddy field and alleviated the model uncertainty by reduced number of model calibration parameters certainly the proposed modifications are centrally pivoted around the proposed conceptualization of the study by sakaguchi et al 2014 however the highly dynamic hydrological behaviour of the paddy field including the variability of percolation rate under different water application phases et dynamics and contribution of irrigation water to streamflow generation revealed the inadequacy of the existing swat pothole approaches in modeling the hydrology of real world paddy fields firstly during the growing phase of paddy ponding depth inside the field is regulated frequently by the farmer whereas in case of pothole the impoundment depth varies in an un controlled manner as addressed by boulange et al 2014 and sakaguchi et al 2014 moreover paddy soil always lies under saturated condition to meet the crop water demand thereby promotes the removal of excess salt and toxic elements from the top soil and maintaining balance of organic matter in the soil in case of asian paddy growing scenario intermittent water application two weeks of drying period is encouraged to reduce water consumption alleviating methane emission and maximizing crop yield these discrepancies between paddy fields and potholes raises an important concern about determination of suitable simulation approach and development of appropriate swat paddy module for simulation of realistic paddy hydrology although traditional rice cultivation practice is characterized by upholding a constant depth of water over ground surface the alternate wetting and drying awd proved to be an improved water saving measure in rice production this measure not only lowers the consumption of water but also promotes root development reduces weed growth and subsequently boost the rice yield largely yang et al 2009 however the variation in subsurface hydrology differs significantly in awd approach from the standing water type rice cultivation measure adopted in indian condition kang et al 2006 upon incorporating the approach of awd in modified hillslope storage boussinesq hsb model sahoo et al 2018 resulted in improved simulation of soil moisture content during the drying phase and better estimation of the water balance components is achieved based on past studies carried out the following research gaps have been identified for the existing swat pothole module i pothole module lacks in conceptualizing the awd framework inside swat model ii erroneous assessment of evaporation from ponding water surface iii excess irrigation water application to subsequent streamflow conversion is not adequately described and iv integrating all loss component to a single parameter reduces the model flexibility these shortcomings hinder the performance of existing swat model for streamflow simulation in paddy dominant agricultural watersheds with the knowledge of above key points the present study tries to address the following research questions 1 does the existing simulation approaches of swat model are equally effective for catchment scale streamflow simulation in paddy dominant watersheds and 2 what is the validity of existing simulation approaches in water balance analysis of paddy hydrological response units hru in light of the above research questions the present study attempts to identify the best simulation approach for streamflow simulation in rain fed and irrigated paddy regions in a paddy cultivation scenario variation in the groundwater recharge flux evapotranspiration flux and percolation loss will be quantified using all the three simulation approaches individually thus the present analysis will be helpful in deciding a generalized catchment scale streamflow simulation approach in paddy dominant regions the limitations identified during water balance analysis will be helpful in developing a process based swat paddy module 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and pedo hydrologic database the kangsabati river basin krb is located in the indian state of west bengal and bounded between the 86 00 e and 87 30 e longitudes and the 22 20 n and 23 30 n latitudes fig 2 the study site has a total area of 120 14 70 km2 which comprises of river catchment portion 5735 22 km2 and command portion 6279 48 km2 the kangsabati river originates in the uplands of the chhota nagpur plateau and flows in south easterly direction before becoming the last contributing river to the ganges river in india the elevation of the krb varies from 2 to 656 m above mean sea level msl the hilly areas are mostly predominant in the north eastern region of the basin rice is the primary crop grown in the command area during the kharif season wherein the kharif season is defined between the period june to october fig 3a the major prevalent soil texture classes present in the krb are sandy clay loam and sandy loam and they combinedly constitute 70 13 of total basin area fig 3b the study basin receives an annual rainfall of 1400 mm and concentrated mostly during monsoon period i e from june to october 2 2 data sources the shuttle radar topography mission srtm 90 m resolution digital elevation model dem was adopted in this study to delineate the study watershed the soil classes were retrieved from the harmonized world soil database s database hwsd v1 1 fao un available at a spatial resolution of 5 km 5 km this database provides data for 16 000 soil mapping units containing two soil layer information 0 30 cm and 30 100 cm deep the extraction of soil information for the concerned study location resulted in six distinct soil classes present over the study region and subsequently the overlay of soil map is performed the land use land cover lulc distribution of the study area was analyzed by using the liss iii satellite imageries http bhuvan nrsc gov in bhuvan links php the prepared lulc map illustrated sixteen discrete land uses in the krb where paddy and forest are the two primary lulc classes of the basin fig 3a moreover daily timeseries of observed climate data precipitation maximum air temperature minimum air temperature solar radiation relative humidity and wind speed for the period 1981 2010 of five weather stations were obtained from the india meteorological department imd kolkata and agro meteorology department government of west bengal the daily streamflow data for the chosen gauging stations were collected from the central water commission cwc asansol west bengal the kangsabati reservoir is considered for simulation with reservoir became operational from 1986 the reservoir surface area when reservoir is filled to emergency and principal spillway are 124 98 km2 and 111 01 km2 respectively and volume of water needed to fill the reservoir to the emergency and principal spillway are 123 500 m3 and 98 186 m3 respectively moreover the essential information related to crop growing practices viz crop calendar pesticide application and irrigation were collected from field surveys information 3 streamflow modeling approaches in swat the hydrological characteristics of paddy field imparts a significance alteration to the catchment streamflow generation dynamics to deal with such scenarios swat can be used with the option of cn and pothole approaches generally the pothole approach in the swat was initially adopted for modeling the depression areas in a catchment subsequently which is adopted for modeling the paddy field hydrology since the concerned location comprises of a complex river reservoir type system the paddy fields located upstream of reservoir are treated as rain fed and the paddy fields located downstream of reservoir are treated as irrigated ones 3 1 cn approach in swat in the cn based approach of the swat the streamflow is simulated using all the land use classes followed by proper calibration of curve numbers however in case of the pothole approach only the paddy dominated areas were simulated by pothole module and for the non paddy fields the cn approach was used in the swat the rainfall runoff conversion is performed by the empirical cn approach given by usda 1972 1 q s u r f p 0 2 s 2 p 0 8 s where q surf is direct runoff mm day p is rainfall mm day and s is the potential soil water retention mm day the detailed estimation of all the related cn parameters could be found in the documentation suggested by arnold et al 1998 the lulc specific cn value is read from the swat input database and subsequently using the eq 1 runoff is simulated from individual hru and aggregated to the sub basin scale hence the appropriate overlaying of soil lulc and slope topographic layers plays a decisive role in the streamflow generation by the cn approach 3 2 existing pothole approach in swat in the swat 2009 only one hru per sub basin can be assigned as pothole however paddy fields may be located in multiple hrus of a sub basin and the underlying limitations of swat 2009 does not permit to assign multiple hrus as pothole inside a sub basin this limitation has been overcome in swat 2012 and multiple hrus are assigned as potholes in order to add a more realistic conceptualization framework to the swat the parametrization of pothole module with their default values are presented in table 1 the value of pot fr was set equal to 1 so that streamflow from all hru area would drain into the paddy fields as the source of irrigation alters the water balance to a greater extent the source of irrigation irr sc was set to 0 no irrigation and 2 reservoir for rain fed and irrigated paddy fields respectively the complete management pattern adopted for this study is shown in table 2 the crop growing period of paddy field consisted of two important phases of water management i e ponding phase and drainage phase fig 1 whenever water is applied in the form of irrigation or rainfall water accumulation begin and the impoundment status gets active in the swat pothole module in ponding phase two dominant hydrologic process components i e percolation and evaporation process occur with almost zero contribution from the paddy field to catchment streamflow generation occurs hence to terminate the ponding phase a maximum pothole water storage volume pot volx was kept as 100 mm and beyond this limit streamflow originated from the paddy fields during the drainage period water from paddy fields tend to disappear in the form of drainage or percolation loss this intermittent irrigation method is strictly followed in the kangsabati catchment command and had been incorporated successfully in the management schedule of this study as irrigation efficiency bears a direct relation with the amount of streamflow generated from the paddy field based on the local survey data irrigation efficiency was presumed to be 65 the excess amount of irrigation water that contributed to streamflow generation irr sq was kept 0 7 and subsequently governs the streamflow generation from the paddy fields the continuous ponding inside the paddy field makes it saturated and the hydraulic conductivity of pothole surface pot k was considered to be 0 03 mm hr after incorporating this parametrization the volume of water entering inside the pothole is estimated as 2 v i n i r r h r u 1 n f r p o t h r u 10 q s u r f h r u q g w h r u l a t h r u a r e a h r u where v in is the volume of water flowing into the pothole m3 day irr is the amount of irrigation water m3 day n is the number of hrus contributing water to the pothole fr pot hru is the fraction of the hru area draining into the pothole q surf hru is the surface runoff from the hru mm day q gw hru is the groundwater flow generated in the hru mm day q lat hru is the lateral flow generated in the hru mm day and area hru is the hru areas during the course of simulation some of the ponding water percolates some evaporates and some transpires through the plant stomata and upon exceeding the maximum storage depth spills into the nearest river reach the basic governing equations adopted from swat theoretical documentation neitsch et al 2002 were used for simulating these processes are given below 3 v seep 240 k sat sa if sw 0 5 fc 240 1 sw fc k sat sa if 0 5 fc sw fc 0 if sw fc 4 v evap 5 1 lai lai evap e 0 sa if lai lai evap 0 if lai lai evap where v seep is the volume of water lost in the form of seepage m3 day k sat is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the 1st soil layer mm hr sa is the pothole surface area ha sw is the soil water content in the profile mm day and fc is the field capacity mm v evap is the volume of water lost by evaporation m3 day lai is the leaf area index of the plants growing in the pothole lai evap is the threshold leaf area index at which no evaporation occurs from the water surface for paddy generally considered 3 5 and e o is the potential evapotranspiration mm day the generated streamflow in both the approaches were routed to the succeeding downstream locations by using the variable storage routing approach 3 3 revised swat pothole approach by sakaguchi et al 2014 considering the drawbacks associated with the existing pothole approach sakaguchi et al 2014 proposed certain modifications and were adopted in this study the initial modification included the estimation of percolation loss taking place inside the paddy field under saturated condition to determine the percolation loss swat model simulation was carried out by varying the percolation rate between 0 and 33 mm day and the nse value for streamflow simulation corresponding to the individual percolation rate was analyzed the percolation rate resulting higher nse was treated as the actual percolation loss occurring in the concerned location therefore a potential percolation rate of 5 mm day was considered for model simulation and this accounted percolation loss lateral flow and seepage through bunds as a single component the developed equation for quantifying the seepage loss is given by 5 v seep 10 pp sa if v stored 10 pp sa v stored if v stored 10 pp sa where pp is potential percolation rate mm day since quantification of daily irrigation water requirement is cumbersome a fixed irrigation depth was assumed for simplifying the model conceptualization the existing pothole approach was not configured properly to account for the streamflow generated due to excess irrigation application to apprehend the abovementioned hydrological process the following modification was incorporated in the revised module 6 irr pot v pot max v stored if v stored irr v pot max irr if v stored irr v pot max where irr pot is the amount of water added to the pothole on a day m3 irr is the volume of water added by irrigation on a day m3 v pot max is the maximum amount of water that can be stored in the impoundment m3 v stored is the initial volume of water stored in the pothole m3 the excess irrigation water attributed to increased streamflow from the paddy field and is expressed by the following equation 7 q surf q surf normal v stored irr v pot max 10 area hru if v stored irr v pot max q surf normal if v s tored irr v pot max where q surf is the amount of surface runoff discharged from hru to the main stream on a given day mm and q surf normal amount of surface runoff discharged from hru to the main stream on a given day neglecting the spill from the pothole caused due to irrigation mm the usual rice cultivation practice is characterized by alternate wetting and drainage phases and the hydrological processes like et and percolation happen simultaneously however the existing pothole approach inactivated the abovementioned processes during the drainage phase of rice cultivation to activate simultaneous occurrence of et and percolation the hru algorithm of swat was modified and incorporated in this study a substantial difference between the magnitude of estimated evaporation from ponded water surface and actual evaporation from ponded water surface was observed during the simulation process as suggested by sakaguchi et al 2014 a reduced evaporation co efficient of 0 6 was adopted in the model framework to reduce the evaporation from ponded water surface moreover during minimal ponding condition the soil evaporation process was activated to abate the evaporation loss from the ponded water 4 model evaluation 4 1 model calibration and sensitivity analysis the catchment scale applicability of the swat model was evaluated using the three previously described model simulation approaches the sensitive parameters affecting the streamflow generation process were identified using the latin hypercube one factor at a time lh oat method the identified sensitive parameters for individual approaches are shown in table 3 the model calibration was carried out separately for individual approach by using the identified sensitive parameters to study the inter annual variability of the model performance three years of model warm up period had been included in the calibration process to limit the underlying uncertainties the model calibration and validation were performed at two locations i e kangsabati reservoir inflow location and mohanpur outlet corresponding to the effect of both rain fed and irrigated paddy fields the daily streamflow time series of the two locations for the period 1996 2006 were used in the calibration and validation process with the initial three years 1996 1998 being treated as model warm up period the model calibration and validation were carried out for the period 1999 2003 and 2004 2006 respectively calibration of hydrological model tends to increase the robustness of model and different flux components are predicted with utmost accuracy murasingh et al 2022 the auto calibration tool swat cup has multiple inbuilt uncertainty analysis and calibration algorithms like sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 abbaspour et al 2004 generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 and parametric solution parasol yang et al 2008 however the associated degree of accuracy and ease of operation leads to adopt sufi 2 algorithm in this study to assist in over parametrization the number of iterations in the calibration of individual approach is limited to five the successive iterations narrowed down the calibration parameter ranges in swat cup and final parameters are decided at the end of calibration the uncertainty in streamflow estimation by the swat can be attributed due to the uncertainty associated with the input data model structure and experience of the modeler the uncertainty in streamflow estimation by the swat can be attributed due to the uncertainty associated with the input data model structure and skill of the modeler dash et al 2023 those uncertainties are quantified using two popular indices viz p factor and r factor the significance and acceptable range of the p factor and r factors could be obtained from the study conducted by abbaspour et al 2004 4 2 goodness of fit assessment to evaluate and inter compare the model performance in all the three approaches the simulated streamflow variable needs to be compared with the observed streamflow data both spatially and temporally the extent of agreement between observed and simulated value was quantified using some goodness of fit assessment indicators dash et al 2022 in past most of the hydrological studies adapt nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and kling gupta efficiency kge as the goodness of fit estimators to evaluate the model performance arnold and allen 1996 eckhardt and arnold 2001 for estimating the likelihood in fitting observed and simulated streamflow the coefficient of determination r2 was used the average tendency of simulated values to be greater or smaller than observed values is statistically determined by using percent bias pbias the acceptable limit of pbias was kept between 15 as per the criteria defined by moriasi et al 2007 5 result and discussions 5 1 evaluation of model sensitivity and uncertainty in catchment scale streamflow simulation 5 1 1 swat cn approach as the adopted approach is cn approach curve number is coming out to be the most sensitive parameter having a final fitted range of 44 79 due to lack of information regarding the basin hydrology complete range of base flow alpha factor alpha bf viz 0 1 was considered in the calibration process a high magnitude of streamflow points towards the existence of some seasonal intermittent tributaries which contribute flow to the main river in addition a moderate value of revapmn suggests that a moderate quantity of evaporation is taking place from the crop root zone table 3 a higher ch k2 value suggests that the riverbed allows passage of water very smoothly and also an indicative of very less infiltration loss over the river bed a lower soil evaporation compensation factor esco value corresponds to less amount of et loss which is an indicative of the inability of cn approach in understanding the plant physiological processes sensitivity analysis results suggested that the flow characteristic of this basin was governed by both surface water and groundwater parameters and might be due to different intermittent streams coming from different locations to join the mainstream having their own characteristics table 3 during calibration the value of p factor at two gauging stations is slightly less than 1 whereas r factor is slightly less than 0 5 similarly during validation period it was found that p factor is 0 58 and 0 63 whereas r factor is 0 70 and 0 59 at the kangsabati reservoir and mohanpur respectively a high p factor value during both calibration and validation phase signified that model is able to capture most of the observed values during simulation process however comparatively high uncertainty for streamflow simulation was observed at mohanpur location the reason of uncertainty is due to the un availability of consistent data of reservoir inflow outflow in a daily timescale a clear insight of different types of uncertainty associated with rain fed and irrigated paddy field condition for streamflow simulation is described in the section 3 1 5 1 2 existing pothole approach swat p pothole structures are number of distinct paddy fields present in a watershed and behaves as a temporary water storage reservoir it functions on the basic principle of volume balance of accumulated water as a consequence of multiple input sources primarily three kinds of inputs occur into the pothole from the upstream hru area rainfall and irrigation the amount of precipitation taking place over the paddy hrus directly regulates the contribution to streamflow from the potholes the soil hydraulic conductivity plays crucial role in deciding the available pothole water depth and the magnitude of water storage volume xie and cui 2011 and became the most sensitive parameter in this approach the readiness in streamflow movement from the pothole surface to the catchment outlet is governed by the channel carrying capacity thus ch k2 became the second most sensitive parameter in pothole approach and a magnitude of 52 mm h corresponds to prompt response of channel in carrying the streamflow towards the outlet a high magnitude of groundwater revap coefficient gw revap corresponds to more evaporation from the crop root zone depicting the soil water deficit scenario in the paddy fields moreover parameter like manning s roughness co efficient n of the main channel is the fourth most sensitive parameter in the pothole approach signifying importance of roughness factor in governing the paddy field streamflow dynamics the uncertainty behaviour is almost similar to that of cn approach for both calibration and validation period however r factor reduced slightly 0 61 during the validation period at mohanpur resulting in higher model uncertainty moreover relatively higher un certainty in case of the pothole approach may be attributed due to the underlying limitations of the pothole module framework in conceptualizing the paddy field dynamics 5 1 3 revised pothole approach swat ps as the basic assumptions of original pothole approach was also followed in the revised pothole approach the volume of water stored in the pothole became the most sensitive calibration parameter certain pothole parameters such as the fraction of hru area that drains into pothole assures the ease with which water from the paddy hru contributes to catchment streamflow generation interestingly no soil parameters were found to be sensitive in the revised pothole approach and becomes the true representative of the fact that under saturated condition of paddy field soil parameters have minimal contribution to streamflow generation process the groundwater delay gw delay value being highest among the three approaches indicates that sub surface movement of water is very slow in the paddy fields and baseflow contribution to surface runoff is more rapid in nature the sub basin slope parameter slsubbsn points towards the vital role of paddy field topography in downstream streamflow generation and its consequent movement towards the outlet the p factor value improved for all the three conditions except for the calibration period of the mohanpur outlet an increased p factor value for the rest three scenarios indicates that in the modified approach more observed values are bracketed inside the simulated values moreover r factor also follows the similar pattern and a magnitude of 0 89 in case of calibration at the mohanpur outlet might be imputed due to the contrasting dynamics of the command region however most of the uncertainty is caused due to the internal module structure of the revised pothole module 5 2 daily scale streamflow calibration and validation the first swat model simulation considered default range of calibration parameters and attempts to form very good agreement between observed and simulated streamflow values hence to achieve this objective extensive calibration of swat model is required the streamflow calibration and validation were carried out at inflow to reservoir sub basin 15 and mohanpur outlet sub basin 39 for the pre defined period sub basin 15 corresponds to a head water catchment and is deprived of the hydropeaking effect whereas the sub basin 39 integrates the hydropeaking effect with command area dynamics and becomes the true representative of catchment scale heterogeneity thus to reflect this diverse hydrological paradigm in the modelling approach a meticulous calibration approach was incorporated in this study and following outcomes were obtained initially 25 calibration parameters were chosen based on extensive literature reviews and upon subsequent refinement calibration parameters were limited to ten maximum value of the objective function was achieved after 4 and 6 iterations in case of cn and pothole approach respectively for this study calibration was approached individually for all the three approaches and the results are discussed below 5 2 1 streamflow calibration in the swat cn approach the value of nse and kge for daily scale reservoir inflow simulation was 0 66 and 0 69 respectively depicting a satisfactory model calibration at the desired locations the dynamics of rain fed paddy fields on streamflow generation process was found to be captured well by the cn approach r2 0 66 and illustrated in figs 4 5 however the model performance was found to be poor when it came to the integrated effect of rain fed paddy fields and irrigated paddy fields on streamflow generation process as evidenced from reduced nse and kge estimates of 0 41 and 0 43 respectively in the context of validation a marginal increase in nse and kge value was observed for both reservoir inflow and mohanpur outlet figs 6 7 the complex hydrologic behavior of the paddy fields curtailed the model performance to a greater extent a detailed agreement between the outcomes of cn approach and observed daily streamflow values are illustrated in the following taylor diagram fig 8 the reservoir inflow simulation by the swat cn model revealed that the root mean square deviation rmsd estimates were ranged between 40 and 60 m3 s whereas a maximum value of 80 m3 s was observed by the swat ps approach indicating the limitation of this approach in modeling the reservoir inflow conversely for mohanpur outlet the swat cn model exhibited highest rmsd estimate of of 144 12 m3 s during the validation period revealing the poor simulation performance of the swat cn approach in modeling the paddy field hydrology further with correlation coefficient estimate of 0 9 the swat ps depicted excellent agreement between the observed and simulate flow time series while the swat cn performed the worst with lowest correlation coefficient estimates of 0 52 overall the swat ps performed the well for the paddy land use condition and swat cn performed well for the reservoir inflow simulation while the swat p performed the worst under both the conditions the pbias statistics for both calibration and validation period lied within the accepted limit as defined by moriasi et al 2007 however with a positive pbias estimates at all the four conditions a constant overestimation of streamflow was replicated throughout the study period this could be due to the non accountability of the significant retention of water inside the paddy fields as standing water during the growth phase of model simulation moreover relatively higher mismatch was observed between the observed and simulated streamflow during the post monsoon period in the meantime this dis agreement between observed and simulated flows got intensified at the mohanpur outlet as the effect of excess irrigation water on streamflow generation was not conceptualized properly by the swat cn model framework as the primary focus of the study is to assess the effect of different simulation approaches over paddy field dynamics the water balance statistics presented here are confined to the paddy cultivation period only the hydrological processes like percolation evapotranspiration lateral flow inside a paddy field are quite different from other land uses furthermore the presence of ponding water leads to a substantial increase in groundwater recharge as per the local farming practice the paddy cultivation period was assumed to be of 131 days duration in the krb during the study period i e from 2003 to 2006 1682 mm of water was lost in the form of percolation inside the paddy hru and percolation rate varied in between 0 and 31 mm day the total amount of et loss in the analysis period was estimated to be 1226 mm which seemed to be lower from that of realistic paddy field et value because of the cn approach the availability of water inside paddy fields decreased and might resulted in reduced et value groundwater recharge showed a delayed response to percolation loss in all the years except 2006 although variations in et and groundwater recharge followed the same pattern the groundwater recharge rate exceeded the et value in the year 2004 and pointed out that very high rainfall had occurred in the paddy hru in the year 2004 a detailed water balance analysis of the paddy hru is illustrated in fig 9 percolation loss was found to be highest during the harvesting phase of paddy cultivation and identifies the severe limitation of cn approach in simulating the percolation process across all the four years in comparison to the upstream paddy fields a reduced percolation rate 0 16 mm day was observed for the irrigated paddy fields this represents the inadequacy of cn approach in replicating the contribution of excess irrigation water towards percolation loss inside the paddy field however an increased magnitude of et 1596 mm was observed and justified the effect of presence of extensive paddy fields in the command area a close observation on groundwater recharge indicates a decrease in its magnitude as compared to the rainfed paddy fields during the four years of study 730 mm of groundwater recharge took place in the mohanpur sub basin and the magnitude of recharge was found to be maximum in the year 2004 the rain fed and irrigated paddy fields showed the similar groundwater recharge pattern and subsequently highlighted the underlying un certainties in the cn approach 5 2 2 streamflow calibration in the existing pothole approach considering real hydrological conditions were highly inconsistent with time the streamflow dynamics was not well reproduced during all the periods by the pothole approach despite the given temporal differences between the analysis years some general streamflow patterns were noticed for all the years figs 4 5 baseflow contribution to streamflow is the highest in the dry periods of model simulation moreover the baseflow contribution was increased substantially after the immediate monsoon period of each year for upland paddy fields nse estimates of 0 59 and 0 65 was observed during calibration and validation periods respectively indicating satisfactory calibration approach the corresponding kge estimates were observed to be 0 61 and 0 65 during calibration and validation periods respectively the uncertainty band captures most of the observed streamflow value with very good accuracy for both calibration and validation periods in reservoir inflow simulation however similar to cn approach a poor simulation outcome was contemplated for the mohanpur outlet wherein the low flows were significantly overestimated figs 6 7 in the validation context for the years 2005 and 2006 most of the peak flows were underestimated resulting in poor nse estimates of 0 49 at the mohanpur outlet the simulation outcomes certainly point towards the poor applicability of the pothole approach over the cn approach the calibrated swat pothole based model was used to estimate the catchment scale water balance of the krb as presented in fig 10 during the analysis period the daily percolation rate varied between 0 and 49 mm day which is significantly greater than the simulated percolation rate in the cn approach subsequently resulting a total of 1723 mm of water to be lost in the form percolation which is slightly higher as compared to the cn approach thus adaptability of pothole approach over the cn approach in a paddy dominant watershed is justified to certain extent percolation value becomes higher when the soil water deficit is maximum followed by an irrigation application event groundwater recharge happens parallel to the percolation process and its magnitude was found to be maximum in the year 2004 fig 10 however a significant contradiction was observed between the variation of groundwater recharge and percolation loss although the percolation rate was high on 8th october 2003 and 5th june 2006 maximum groundwater recharge of 5 mm day was occurred on the 3rd september 2004 thus higher percolation loss contributes less towards groundwater recharge as compared to lower continuous percolation loss values as percolation loss was underestimated to a greater extent the corresponding groundwater recharge 1006 mm that took place during the analysis period was also quite low during intermittent irrigation application release operation is a complimentary process in paddy cultivation moreover during the release period hydrologic phenomenon like percolation evapotranspiration and lateral flow remain active however the swat p module structure does not permit those processes to happen during the release phase resulting in reduced percolation and groundwater recharge during the study period 1672 mm of water was lost in the form of evapotranspiration and the highest magnitude of 5 mm was observed on 3rd july 2006 however smaller un realistic et values of magnitude 0 29 mm day and 0 35 mm day were observed on 1st week of june 2003 and 1st week of june 2004 respectively pointing out the underlying uncertainty associated with the existing pothole module the evaporation process inside the paddy fields is characterized under two heads viz from the ponded water surface and from the soil water however the pothole module does not permit evaporation from soil water under ponded condition and resulting in reduced et estimation at the command region percolation rate reduced significantly and found to be varying between 0 and 19 mm day however the number of zero percolation values reduced to a greater extent and the effect of irrigated paddies was found to be simulated relatively well in the pothole approach as a consequence of reduced percolation loss groundwater recharge also decreased at the mohanpur outlet to a greater extent 5 2 3 streamflow calibration in the revised pothole approach after incorporating the improved hydrologic formulations to the existing pothole approach the model calibration and validation were carried out by the swat ps at the two test locations the revised approach has resulted in marginal increase in nse value during the calibration period of both reservoir inflow and mohanpur outlet however the model performance was not satisfactory during the validation period at mohanpur outlet nse 0 51 moreover significant improvement was observed during the validation phase of reservoir inflow simulation for most of the timescales in the validation period the catchment rainfall runoff dynamics was found to be replicated in a much improved way by the revised swat pothole approach although significant underestimation and overestimation were observed during the validation period of reservoir inflow and mohanpur outlet respectively the water balance statistics of the revised pothole approach varied significantly than the previous two approaches fig 11 in reservoir sub basin the total estimated et loss of 1317 mm showed a moderate response between the cn and the existing pothole approach the activation of soil evaporation process during minimal ponding water depth resulted in slight increase in et value as compared to the cn approach however the number of days having et values below 0 5 mm day has been reduced drastically across all the four years in case of the extreme downstream sub basin the total et magnitude slightly increased to 1467 mm and the et reproduction was almost like the earlier approaches adoption of a constant potential percolation rate of 30 mm day in the swat ps conceptualization has resulted in significant increase in percolation loss for both the locations in case of rain fed paddy fields 2591 mm of water was lost in the form of percolation revealing the sub surface hydrology altered in a complex manner being directly correlated with the percolation process an increased groundwater recharge of 1564 mm was observed for the rain fed paddy condition however the effect of modified irrigation algorithm was reflected on the water balance of lowland paddy fields incorporation of excess irrigation water contribution to the streamflow generation process lead to increased streamflow at the mohanpur sub basin certainly a reduced residence time of excess irrigation water in the paddy fields had resulted only 1334 mm amount of water as percolation loss and subsequently groundwater recharge reduces to 678 mm although the water balance dynamics of paddy field under both rainfed and irrigated condition showed a realistic simulation outcome a lot of physical aspects of are yet to be conceptualized by the swat model in the paddy dominant regions 5 3 validation of swat simulated etact estimates the major water balance components of swat include the actual crop et soil moisture storage percolation loss and baseflow to justify the robustness of the calibrated and validated hydrological model it is quite imperative to check the reproduction of observed water balance components by its simulated counterparts however due to the limited availability of observed information only the etact component was chosen for validation to quantify the reproducibility of etact by individual swat hydrological frameworks the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis based mod16a2 etact data is considered as the benchmark et information and subsequently the spatiotemporal plot of et is in a given paddy hru is presented in fig 12 as envisaged from fig 12 the swat ps reproduces the 8 daily et with a high nse value of 0 42 whereas the swat cn and swat p not performed well as seen from nse estimates of 0 05 and 0 22 respectively while depicting the paddy hru water balance under irrigated condition the swat cn and swat p showed more degree of disagreement with the benchmark etact during the kharif season the poorest being the swat p as evidenced by higher rmse value of 9 67 mm 8 day the swat ps performed the best as envisaged from rmse estimate of 6 43 mm 8 day however like the streamflow representation dynamics of etact is lacking in case of both the swat cn and swat p approaches the non accountability of irrigation return flow in the existing swat cn and swat p variants caused considerable overestimation resulting pbias estimates in the order of 22 4 and 26 3 respectively 6 discussion swat as a process based model is popular for its multi faceted catchment scale applications and in planning various water management activities several past studies carried out using cn approach resulted in very good nse value by conceptualizing the complex catchment processes in a simple manner however the hru level uncertainty caused by those approaches alter micro scale management operations like irrigation requirement pollutant and pesticide loading from paddy fields to great extent the conventional cn approach adopted in this study discriminates the paddy land use from the remaining lulc classes by means of modified cn values completely ignores the effect of standing water and storage occurring inside the paddy fields this leads to highly erroneous outcomes from the swat model similarly the swat p and swat ps although tried to conceptualize the paddy hydrology upon considering the standing water and storage effect most of the process components are conceptualized by means of empirical equations or lumped assumptions moreover the major vadose zone hydrological process alterations under drying and ponding stage of paddy field is completely ignored in their model conceptualization the monthly streamflow simulation in the ken river basin was carried out by using the cn approach represents a very good agreement between observe and simulated streamflow murty et al 2013 du et al 2013 adopted the cn approach for daily streamflow simulation in an agricultural watershed having 2631 km2 area by using both fixed and variable parametrization approach however the concept of variable parameter approach predicted the streamflow with very good accuracy upon exclusively distributing the calibration parameters across the paddy and non paddy hrus the concept of critical depth so introduced to control the irrigation depth and drainage operation in paddy fields lowered the uncertainty associated with streamflow simulation and the model performance improved drastically the swat ps approach was initially applied in the arata river watershed 3 km2 by the sakaguchi et al 2014 and paddy hru scale water balance has been estimated an nse value of 0 73 justifies its improved applicability over the cn approach in paddy dominant regions similarly the application of existing pothole approach in field scale application is found to be performing satisfactorily with nse estimates of 0 87 however applicability of the revised pothole approach for catchment scale streamflow simulation has not been examined the substantial amount of percolation loss is exhibited by all the three simulation approaches in cn approach the paddy field was treated in a similar fashion as that of other land uses where the standing water dynamics on various hydrological fluxes was not simulated effectively moreover the cn approach functions on the concept of antecedent moisture condition amc indicating that under dry condition most of the rainfall contributes to infiltration and subsequently increases the percolation loss gassman et al 2022 however in case of the existing and revised pothole approaches erroneous conceptualization of the vadose zone hydrology could have consequence the poor match between the observed and simulated percolation loss from the paddy fields the downstream location of the catchment mimics the effect of both rain fed and irrigated paddy fields hence a relatively dynamic percolation loss pattern was observed the pothole module is based on the basic assumption that when soil moisture content reaches field capacity percolation process stops from the paddy fields however paddy fields always remain in saturated condition and seepage process happens actively during the growing periods resulting in reduced percolation loss during the saturation phase relatively higher percolation loss by both the swat pothole approaches in comparison to the swat cn approach resulted more groundwater recharge across the paddy going regions which is in line with findings of the study proposed by padhiary et al 2022 the water balance analysis as depicted from the swat ps model revealed that the dominant sub surface hydrologic processes like percolation loss and groundwater recharge gradually reduces and attains a constant rate in conjunction with the previously described two water balance components the swat ps exhibited relatively better 8 daily etact simulation scenario as compared to the swat cn and swat p and in line with the findings by himanshu et al 2022 mostly the hydrological modeling studies are catchment scale in nature for effective implementation of management strategies like flood control irrigation application and hydro power plants etc as scale of application plays a vital role in hydrological modelling it is impractical to say that a single model will be equally effective for both micro scale and macro scale applications every time relying on the adjustment of calibration parameter does not solve the problem associated with simulation of hydrological flux components hence the revised approach has been tested for its suitability in catchment scale applications and possible improvements are identified for implementation in the future studies 6 1 way forward this study attempted to examine the applicability of three model simulation approaches in a paddy dominant agricultural watershed and the shortcomings of individual approaches have been identified the cn approach was unable to quantify the actual amount of seepage loss taking place inside the paddy field and resulted in severe underestimation of streamflow at the final outlet although existing pothole approach estimates the percolation loss during impounding period a difference of 213 mm could be noticed between the observed and simulated percolation loss to overcome these shortcomings attempts made by researchers include incorporation of three critical depths for simulating the overflow from potholes and a constant percolation rate of 1 cm day from ponded paddy field boulange et al 2014 separate quantification of et during dry and wet periods of paddy cultivation controlling irrigation and drainage operation by the critical water depth xie et al 2011 and experimental determination of potential percolation rate for paddy field as well as activating certain hydrological processes during the release phase of paddy field which were not functional in the original algorithm sakaguchi et al 2014 recently apart from streamflow simulation swat model is getting popular for catchment scale assessment of water quality pollutant loading in agricultural regions and urban planning however improper assessment of hydrological fluxes leads to erroneous policy implementation in the desired locations to address these concerns more improvements to the revised pothole module is highly essential and a fully functional swat paddy module is required to be developed the following modifications may improve the accuracy of streamflow prediction in paddy dominant agricultural watersheds by using swat model 1 the return flow caused due to the application of excess irrigation water contributes to streamflow and need to be incorporated properly into the modeling framework 2 in a limited water availability scenario alternate wetting and drying awd is a very popular approach for irrigation application this intermittent irrigation application alters the hydrological fluxes in a different manner than usual way of irrigation application hence the soil moisture content evapotranspiration values need to be estimated accurately under the awd scenario 3 the existing and revised pothole approaches perform poorly in modeling the sub surface hydrological processes as paddy field always remains in a near saturated condition the method for estimating saturated hydraulic conductivity needs to be modified so that the associated hydrological phenomena can be conceptualized in more realistic way these propitious modifications may lead to the development of a fully physical swat paddy module which will be capable of hypothesizing the impoundment effect over streamflow generation and crop yield assessment phenomena in catchment scale applications 7 conclusions this study was proposed to identify the suitable streamflow simulation approach in a paddy dominant agricultural watershed a considerable deviation was observed between actual paddy field hydrology and pothole simulated paddy field hydrology across the catchment based on the findings of the study the following specific conclusions could be drawn 1 the cn approach performed well for rain fed paddy scenarios 0 42 nse 0 63 original pothole approach failed to perform satisfactorily for both the scenarios 0 45 nse 0 62 and the revised pothole approach of model simulation was found to be performing well for irrigated paddy scenario 0 51 nse 0 62 2 the revised pothole approach which has been tested earlier in a field scale application performing better than the original pothole model however the catchment scale hydrological flux quantification is not satisfactory 3 excess irrigation water resulted in substantial amount of return flow while the modeling framework of the pothole module was unable to replicate its additive effect over streamflow generated at the final outlet of the kangsabati river basin 4 both existing and revised pothole module simulation outcomes indicate zero percolation loss most of the time and subsequently the groundwater recharge reduced to a greater extent across the paddy fields the incorrect simulation of percolation loss resulted in higher et value as well as very low value of 0 1 mm day was also observed for certain timescales the outcomes from all the swat streamflow simulation approaches are highly unreliable and may not be adopted directly in the decision making process hence it is quite imperative to develop a fully physical swat paddy module which will be capable of replicating the paddy field dynamics these improvements may yield more favorable environment for water management planning in a paddy growing agricultural

9074,the applicability of soil and water assessment tool swat for rainfall runoff modelling in the river reservoir integrated catchment command areas is limited due to the limited description of paddy field dynamics to model the dominant paddy field hydrology in most of the catchments of asian countries with tropical monsoon type climatology the popular swat couples a pothole module in place of the conventional curve number cn approach although few pothole approaches are existing in the literature the efficacy of these modules have not been evaluated for catchment scale applications moreover the existing pothole modules are more conceptual in nature with many calibration parameters that could yield erroneous outcomes in catchment scale applications to address these issues the applicability of the pothole module was assesses and evaluated in a 12 014 70 km2 river catchment reservoir command iof eastern india the simulation results reveal that for streamflow generation the revised pothole approach performed the best with the nse of 0 62 followed by the cn approach nse 0 60 and the original pothole approach nse 0 59 the water balance analysis resulted small evapotranspiration et values 0 01 mm day for the cn approach and existing approach based model simulation the daily streamflow prediction uncertainty was the highest in case of existing pothole approach with r factor estimate of 0 73 followed by 0 58 and 0 56 in case of cn approach and revised pothole approach respectively overall the cn approach performs better in case of rain fed paddy field whereas the revised pothole approach simulates the daily scale streamflow better in the irrigated paddy conditions keywords paddy field pothole swat uncertainty analysis water balance data availability the authors do not have

hazards ravazzani et al 2015 irrigation water application ramireddygari et al 2000 appraisal of environmental flow requirement karimi et al 2012 and hydropower generation wagner et al 2017 the catchment scale estimation of streamflow in paddy dominant agricultural watershed is confined to water balance approaches khepar et al 2000 and physically based approaches refsgaard and storm 1995 arnold et al 1998 the conceptualization of water balance approaches is based on numerous calibration parameters however upon characterizing complex hydrological phenomena with the help of simple co efficient fails to capture the actual dynamics of the paddy field hydrology the process based models like soil and water assessment tool swat and système hydrologique européen mike she simulated the surface and sub surface hydrology of paddy fields by means of the model numeric conceptualizations across the south east asia regions dash et al 2023 im et al 2007 padhiary et al 2020 the mike she

lai and root distribution function rdf from the swat database the swat is river basin scale continuous time scale model capable of simulating the streamflow sediment yield and loading from non point sources under varying environmental and climatic scenarios dash et al 2021 the potential of swat to account for agricultural management practices soil conservation practices and water retention structures including ponds and reservoirs have evolved it to a more robust and flexible modelling alternative under varying environmental and lulc conditions gassman et al 2022 dash et al 2019 in south eastern part of the asian regions the agricultural catchments are cultivated with paddy crops during both the rainy monsoon and dry lean periods with pre dominant ponding and non ponding conditions sakaguchi et al 2014 the behaviour of the paddy fields under the presence of standing water and recurrent irrigation application during the paddy cultivation makes the swat based hydrological modeling more cumbersome this led to the development of an embedded pothole module for exclusive modeling of the paddy field hydrology under alternate wetting and drying condition du et al 2005 the very first pothole variant was developed with an intent to model an agricultural field cultivated with corn soybean and characterized by great number of potholes caused due to poor drainage the pothole module underlined three primary hydrological process components tile flow under sub surface drainage condition water table fluctuation and role of pothole topography on streamflow simulation in river basin scale applications fig 1 however water retention and water ponding aspect lead to the adoption of the pothole module in paddy dominant agricultural watersheds for realistic representation of rice field kang et al 2006 xie et al 2011 boulange et al 2014 the pothole module in swat was modified to understand the evapotranspiration et loss during both the ponding and drainage soil condition xie and cui 2011 the evaporation loss was presumed to occur from the standing water surface and soil surface during ponded condition and drainage condition respectively the water stress condition inside the pothole was ascertained by a threshold ponding water level as defined by guo 1997 and subsequent amount of irrigation water was triggered while developing a total maximum daily load programme kang et al 2006 characterized the daily percolation rates of paddy field under saturated condition by assigning a fixed percolation rate value to specific soil classes in swat pothole module this attempt completely ignored the soil moisture movement under saturated soil condition and lacked the dynamism in sub surface hydrological processes a coupled pcpf 1 swat was developed to estimate catchment scale pesticide concentration in surface soil and streamflow generated from paddy field tu et al 2018 the modified swat pothole model incorporated the lateral seepage through the bunds during the computation of paddy field water balance sakaguchi et al 2014 showed the in adequacy of pothole module in simulating paddy field water balance dynamics and implemented significant improvements to the existing pothole module a term potential percolation rate was introduced which combinedly account for the lateral seepage through embankment and vertical percolation taking place inside the paddy field and alleviated the model uncertainty by reduced number of model calibration parameters certainly the proposed modifications are centrally pivoted around the proposed conceptualization of the study by sakaguchi et al 2014 however the highly dynamic hydrological behaviour of the paddy field including the variability of percolation rate under different water application phases et dynamics and contribution of irrigation water to streamflow generation revealed the inadequacy of the existing swat pothole approaches in modeling the hydrology of real world paddy fields firstly during the growing phase of paddy ponding depth inside the field is regulated frequently by the farmer whereas in case of pothole the impoundment depth varies in an un controlled manner as addressed by boulange et al 2014 and sakaguchi et al 2014 moreover paddy soil always lies under saturated condition to meet the crop water demand thereby promotes the removal of excess salt and toxic elements from the top soil and maintaining balance of organic matter in the soil in case of asian paddy growing scenario intermittent water application two weeks of drying period is encouraged to reduce water consumption alleviating methane emission and maximizing crop yield these discrepancies between paddy fields and potholes raises an important concern about determination of suitable simulation approach and development of appropriate swat paddy module for simulation of realistic paddy hydrology although traditional rice cultivation practice is characterized by upholding a constant depth of water over ground surface the alternate wetting and drying awd proved to be an improved water saving measure in rice production this measure not only lowers the consumption of water but also promotes root development reduces weed growth and subsequently boost the rice yield largely yang et al 2009 however the variation in subsurface hydrology differs significantly in awd approach from the standing water type rice cultivation measure adopted in indian condition kang et al 2006 upon incorporating the approach of awd in modified hillslope storage boussinesq hsb model sahoo et al 2018 resulted in improved simulation of soil moisture content during the drying phase and better estimation of the water balance components is achieved based on past studies carried out the following research gaps have been identified for the existing swat pothole module i pothole module lacks in conceptualizing the awd framework inside swat model ii erroneous assessment of evaporation from ponding water surface iii excess irrigation water application to subsequent streamflow conversion is not adequately described and iv integrating all loss component to a single parameter reduces the model flexibility these shortcomings hinder the performance of existing swat model for streamflow simulation in paddy dominant agricultural watersheds with the knowledge of above key points the present study tries to address the following research questions 1 does the existing simulation approaches of swat model are equally effective for catchment scale streamflow simulation in paddy dominant watersheds and 2 what is the validity of existing simulation approaches in water balance analysis of paddy hydrological response units hru in light of the above research questions the present study attempts to identify the best simulation approach for streamflow simulation in rain fed and irrigated paddy regions in a paddy cultivation scenario variation in the groundwater recharge flux evapotranspiration flux and percolation loss will be quantified using all the three simulation approaches individually thus the present analysis will be helpful in deciding a generalized catchment scale streamflow simulation approach in paddy dominant regions the limitations identified during water balance analysis will be helpful in developing a process based swat paddy module 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and pedo hydrologic database the kangsabati river basin krb is located in the indian state of west bengal and bounded between the 86 00 e and 87 30 e longitudes and the 22 20 n

radiation relative humidity and wind speed for the period 1981 2010 of five weather stations were obtained from the india meteorological department imd kolkata and agro meteorology department government of west bengal the daily streamflow data for the chosen gauging stations were collected from the central water commission cwc asansol west bengal the kangsabati reservoir is considered for simulation with reservoir became operational from 1986 the reservoir surface area when reservoir is filled to emergency and principal spillway are 124 98 km2 and 111 01 km2 respectively and volume of water needed to fill the reservoir to the emergency and principal spillway are 123 500 m3 and 98 186 m3 respectively moreover the essential information related to crop growing practices viz crop calendar pesticide application and irrigation were collected from field surveys information 3 streamflow modeling approaches in swat the hydrological characteristics of paddy field imparts a significance alteration to the catchment streamflow generation dynamics to deal with such scenarios swat can be used with the option of cn and pothole approaches generally the pothole approach in the swat was initially adopted for modeling the depression areas in a catchment subsequently which is adopted for modeling the paddy field hydrology since the concerned location comprises of a complex river reservoir type system the paddy fields located upstream of reservoir are treated as rain fed and the paddy fields located downstream of reservoir are treated as irrigated ones 3 1 cn approach in swat in the cn based approach of the swat the streamflow is simulated using all the land use classes followed by proper calibration of curve numbers however in case of the pothole approach only the paddy dominated areas were simulated by pothole module and for the non paddy fields the cn approach was used in the swat the rainfall runoff conversion is performed by the empirical cn approach given by usda 1972 1 q s u r f p 0 2 s 2 p 0 8 s where q surf is direct runoff mm day p is rainfall mm day and s is the potential soil water retention mm day the detailed estimation of all the related cn parameters could be found in the documentation suggested by arnold et al 1998 the lulc specific cn value is read from the swat input database and subsequently using the eq 1 runoff is simulated from individual hru and aggregated to the sub basin scale hence the appropriate overlaying of soil lulc and slope topographic layers plays a decisive role in the streamflow generation by the cn approach 3 2 existing pothole approach in swat in the swat 2009 only one hru per sub basin can be assigned as pothole however paddy fields may be located in multiple hrus of a sub basin and the underlying limitations of swat 2009 does not permit to assign multiple hrus as pothole inside a sub basin this limitation has been overcome in swat 2012 and multiple hrus are assigned as potholes in order to add a more realistic conceptualization framework to the swat the parametrization of pothole module with their default values are presented in table 1 the value of pot fr was set equal to 1 so that streamflow from all hru area would drain into the paddy fields as the source of irrigation alters the water balance to a greater extent the source of irrigation irr sc was set to 0 no irrigation and 2 reservoir for rain fed and irrigated paddy fields respectively the complete management pattern adopted for this study is shown in table 2 the crop growing period of paddy field consisted of two important phases of water management i e ponding phase and drainage phase fig 1 whenever water is applied in the form of irrigation or rainfall water accumulation begin and the impoundment status gets active in the swat pothole module in ponding phase two dominant hydrologic process components i e percolation and evaporation process occur with almost zero contribution from the paddy field to catchment streamflow generation occurs hence to terminate the ponding phase a maximum pothole water storage volume pot volx was kept as 100 mm and beyond this limit streamflow originated from the paddy fields during the drainage period water from paddy fields tend to disappear in the form of drainage or percolation loss this intermittent irrigation method is strictly followed in the kangsabati catchment command and had been incorporated successfully in the management schedule of this study as irrigation efficiency bears a direct relation with the amount of streamflow generated from the paddy field based on the local survey data irrigation efficiency was presumed to be 65 the excess amount of irrigation water that contributed to streamflow generation irr sq was kept 0 7 and subsequently governs the streamflow generation from the paddy fields the continuous ponding inside the paddy field makes it saturated and the hydraulic conductivity of pothole surface pot k was considered to be 0 03 mm hr after incorporating this parametrization the volume of water entering inside the pothole is estimated as 2 v i n i r r h r u 1 n f r p o t h r u 10 q s u r f h r u q g w h

lateral flow generated in the hru mm day and area hru is the hru areas during the course of simulation some of the ponding water percolates some evaporates and some transpires through the plant stomata and upon exceeding the maximum storage depth spills into the nearest river reach the basic governing equations adopted from swat theoretical documentation neitsch et al 2002 were used for simulating these processes are given below 3 v seep 240 k sat sa if sw 0 5 fc 240 1 sw fc k sat sa if 0 5 fc sw fc 0 if sw fc 4 v evap 5 1 lai lai evap e 0 sa if lai lai evap 0 if lai lai evap where v

leaf area index at which no evaporation occurs from the water surface for paddy generally considered 3 5 and e o is the potential evapotranspiration mm day the generated streamflow in both the approaches were routed to the succeeding downstream locations by using the variable storage routing approach 3 3 revised swat pothole approach by sakaguchi et al 2014 considering the drawbacks associated with the existing pothole approach sakaguchi et al 2014 proposed certain modifications and were adopted in this study the initial modification included the estimation of percolation loss taking place inside the paddy field under saturated condition to determine the percolation loss swat model simulation was carried out by varying the percolation rate between 0 and 33 mm day and the nse value for streamflow simulation corresponding to the individual percolation rate was analyzed the percolation rate resulting higher nse was treated as the actual percolation loss occurring in the concerned location therefore a potential percolation rate of 5 mm day was considered for model simulation and this accounted percolation loss lateral flow and seepage through bunds as a single component the developed equation for quantifying the seepage loss is given by 5 v seep 10 pp sa if v stored 10 pp sa v stored if v stored 10 pp sa where pp is potential percolation rate mm day since quantification of daily irrigation water requirement is cumbersome a fixed irrigation depth was assumed for simplifying the model conceptualization the existing pothole approach was not configured properly to account for the streamflow generated due to excess irrigation application to apprehend the abovementioned hydrological process the following modification was incorporated in the revised module 6 irr pot v pot max v stored if v stored irr v pot max irr if v stored irr v pot max where irr pot is the amount of water added to the pothole on a day m3 irr is the volume of water added by irrigation on a day m3 v pot max is the maximum amount of water that can be stored in the impoundment m3 v stored is the initial volume of water stored in the pothole m3 the excess irrigation water attributed to increased streamflow from the paddy field and is expressed by the following equation 7 q surf q surf normal v stored irr v pot max 10 area hru if v stored irr v pot max q surf normal if v s tored irr v pot max where q surf is the amount of surface runoff discharged from hru to the main stream on a given day mm and q surf normal amount of surface runoff discharged from hru to the main stream on a given day neglecting the spill from the pothole caused due to irrigation mm the usual rice cultivation practice is characterized by alternate wetting and drainage phases and the hydrological processes like et and percolation happen simultaneously however the existing pothole approach inactivated the abovementioned processes during the drainage phase of rice cultivation to activate simultaneous occurrence of et and percolation the hru algorithm of swat was modified and incorporated in this study a substantial difference between the magnitude of estimated evaporation from ponded water surface and actual evaporation from ponded water surface was observed during the simulation process as suggested by sakaguchi et al 2014 a reduced evaporation co efficient of 0 6 was adopted in the model framework to reduce the evaporation from ponded water surface moreover during minimal ponding condition the soil evaporation process was activated to abate the evaporation loss from the ponded water 4 model evaluation 4 1 model calibration and sensitivity analysis the catchment scale applicability of the swat model was evaluated using the three previously described model simulation approaches the sensitive parameters affecting the streamflow generation process were identified using the latin hypercube one factor at a time lh oat method the identified sensitive parameters for individual approaches are shown in table 3 the model calibration was carried out separately for individual approach by using the identified sensitive parameters to study the inter annual variability of the model performance three years of model warm up period had been included in the calibration process to limit the underlying uncertainties the model calibration and validation were performed at two locations i e kangsabati reservoir inflow location and mohanpur outlet corresponding to the effect of both rain fed and irrigated paddy fields the daily streamflow time series of the two locations for the period 1996 2006 were used in the calibration and validation process with the initial three years 1996 1998 being treated as model warm up period the model calibration and validation were carried out for the period 1999 2003 and 2004 2006 respectively calibration of hydrological model tends to increase the robustness of model and different flux components are predicted with utmost accuracy murasingh et al 2022 the auto calibration tool swat cup has multiple inbuilt uncertainty analysis and calibration algorithms like sequential uncertainty fitting version 2 sufi 2 abbaspour et al 2004 generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue beven and binley 1992 and parametric solution parasol yang et al 2008 however the associated degree of accuracy and ease of operation leads to adopt sufi 2 algorithm in this study to assist in over parametrization the number of iterations in the calibration of individual approach is limited to five the successive iterations narrowed down the calibration parameter ranges in swat cup and final parameters are decided at the end of calibration the uncertainty in streamflow estimation by the swat can be attributed due to the uncertainty associated with the input data model structure and experience of the modeler the uncertainty in streamflow estimation by the swat can be attributed due to the uncertainty associated with the input data model structure and skill of the modeler dash et al 2023 those uncertainties are quantified using two popular indices viz p factor and r factor the significance and acceptable range of the p factor and r factors could be obtained from the study conducted by abbaspour et al 2004 4 2 goodness of fit assessment to evaluate and inter compare the model performance in all the three approaches the simulated streamflow variable needs to be compared with the observed streamflow data both spatially and temporally the extent of agreement between observed and simulated value was quantified using some goodness of fit assessment indicators dash et al 2022 in past most of the hydrological studies adapt nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and kling gupta efficiency kge as the goodness of fit estimators to evaluate the model performance arnold and allen 1996 eckhardt and arnold 2001 for estimating the likelihood in fitting observed and simulated streamflow the coefficient of determination r2 was used the average tendency of simulated values to be greater or smaller than observed values is statistically determined by using percent bias pbias the acceptable limit of pbias was kept between 15 as per the criteria defined by moriasi et al 2007 5 result and discussions 5 1 evaluation of model sensitivity and uncertainty in catchment scale streamflow simulation 5 1 1 swat cn approach as the adopted approach is cn approach curve number is coming out to be the most sensitive parameter having a final fitted range of 44 79 due to lack of information regarding the basin hydrology complete range of base flow alpha factor alpha bf viz 0 1 was considered in the calibration process a high magnitude of streamflow points towards the existence of some seasonal intermittent tributaries which contribute flow to the main river in addition a moderate value of revapmn suggests that a moderate quantity of evaporation is taking place from the crop root zone table 3 a higher ch k2 value suggests that the riverbed allows passage of water very smoothly and also an indicative of very less infiltration loss over the river bed a lower soil evaporation compensation factor esco value corresponds to less amount of et loss which is an indicative of the inability of cn approach in understanding the plant physiological processes sensitivity analysis results suggested that the flow characteristic of this basin was governed by both surface water and groundwater parameters and might be due to different intermittent streams coming from different locations to join the mainstream having their own characteristics table 3 during calibration the value of p factor at two gauging stations is slightly less than 1 whereas r factor is slightly less than 0 5 similarly during validation period it was found that p factor is 0 58 and 0 63 whereas r factor is 0 70 and 0 59 at the kangsabati reservoir and mohanpur respectively a high p factor value during both calibration and validation phase signified that model is able to capture most of the observed values during simulation process however comparatively high uncertainty for streamflow simulation was observed at mohanpur location the reason of uncertainty is due to the un availability of consistent data of reservoir inflow outflow in a daily timescale a clear insight of different types of uncertainty associated with rain fed and irrigated paddy field condition for streamflow simulation is described in the section 3 1 5 1 2 existing pothole approach swat p pothole structures are number of distinct paddy fields present in a watershed and behaves as a temporary water storage reservoir it functions on the basic principle of volume balance of accumulated water as a consequence of multiple input sources primarily three kinds of inputs occur into the pothole from the upstream hru area rainfall and irrigation the amount of precipitation taking place over the paddy hrus directly regulates the contribution to streamflow from the potholes the soil hydraulic conductivity plays crucial role in deciding the available pothole water depth and the magnitude of water storage volume xie and cui 2011 and became the most sensitive parameter in this approach the readiness in streamflow movement from the pothole surface to the catchment outlet is governed by the channel carrying capacity thus ch k2 became the second most sensitive parameter in pothole approach and a magnitude of 52 mm h corresponds to prompt response of channel in carrying the streamflow towards the outlet a high magnitude of groundwater revap coefficient gw revap corresponds to more evaporation from the crop root zone depicting the soil water deficit scenario in the paddy fields moreover parameter like manning s roughness co efficient n of the main channel is the fourth most sensitive parameter in the pothole approach signifying importance of roughness factor in governing the paddy field streamflow dynamics the uncertainty behaviour is almost similar to that of cn approach for both calibration and validation period however r factor reduced slightly 0 61 during the validation period at mohanpur resulting in higher model uncertainty moreover relatively higher un certainty in case of the pothole approach may be attributed due to the underlying limitations of the pothole module framework in conceptualizing the paddy field dynamics 5 1 3 revised pothole approach swat ps as the basic assumptions of original pothole approach was also followed in the revised pothole approach the volume of water stored in the pothole became the most sensitive calibration parameter certain pothole parameters such as the fraction of hru area that drains into pothole assures the ease with which water from the paddy hru contributes to catchment streamflow generation interestingly no soil parameters were found to be sensitive in the revised pothole approach and becomes the true representative of the fact that under saturated condition of paddy field soil parameters have minimal contribution to streamflow generation process the groundwater delay gw delay value being highest among the three approaches indicates that sub surface movement of water is very slow in the paddy fields and baseflow contribution to surface runoff is more rapid in nature the sub basin slope parameter slsubbsn points towards the vital role of paddy field topography in downstream streamflow generation and its consequent movement towards the outlet the p factor value improved for all the three conditions except for the calibration period of the mohanpur outlet an increased p factor value for the rest three scenarios indicates that in the modified approach more observed values are bracketed inside the simulated values moreover r factor also follows the similar pattern and a magnitude of 0 89 in case of calibration at the mohanpur outlet might be imputed due to the contrasting dynamics of the command region however most of the uncertainty is caused due to the internal module structure of the revised pothole module 5 2 daily scale streamflow calibration and validation the first swat model simulation considered default range of calibration parameters and attempts to form very good agreement between observed and simulated streamflow values hence to achieve this objective extensive calibration of swat model is required the streamflow calibration and validation were carried out at inflow to reservoir sub basin 15 and mohanpur outlet sub basin 39 for the pre defined period sub basin 15 corresponds to a head water catchment and is deprived of the hydropeaking effect whereas the sub basin 39 integrates the hydropeaking effect with command area dynamics and becomes the true representative of catchment scale heterogeneity thus to reflect this diverse hydrological paradigm in the modelling approach a meticulous calibration approach was incorporated in this study and following outcomes were obtained initially 25 calibration parameters were chosen based on extensive literature reviews and upon subsequent refinement calibration parameters were limited to ten maximum value of the objective function was achieved after 4 and 6 iterations in case of cn and pothole approach respectively for this study calibration was approached individually for all the three approaches and the results are discussed below 5 2 1 streamflow calibration in the swat cn approach the value of nse and kge for daily scale reservoir inflow simulation was 0 66 and 0 69 respectively depicting a satisfactory model calibration at the desired locations the dynamics of rain fed paddy fields on streamflow generation process was found to be captured well by the cn approach r2 0 66 and illustrated in figs 4 5 however the model performance was found to be poor when it came to the integrated effect of rain fed paddy fields and irrigated paddy fields on streamflow generation process as evidenced from reduced nse and kge estimates of 0 41 and 0 43 respectively in the context of validation a marginal increase in nse and kge value was observed for both reservoir inflow and mohanpur outlet figs 6 7 the complex hydrologic behavior of the paddy fields curtailed the model performance to a greater extent a detailed agreement between the outcomes of cn approach and observed daily streamflow values are illustrated in the following taylor diagram fig 8 the reservoir inflow simulation by the swat cn model revealed that the root mean square deviation rmsd estimates were ranged between 40 and 60 m3 s whereas a maximum value of 80 m3 s was observed by the swat ps approach indicating the limitation of this approach in modeling the reservoir inflow conversely for mohanpur outlet the swat cn model exhibited highest rmsd estimate of of 144 12 m3 s during the validation period revealing the poor simulation performance of the swat cn approach in modeling the paddy field hydrology further with correlation coefficient estimate of 0 9 the swat ps depicted excellent agreement between the observed and simulate flow time series while the swat cn performed the worst with lowest correlation coefficient estimates of 0 52 overall the swat ps performed the well for the paddy land use condition and swat cn performed well for the reservoir inflow simulation while the swat p performed the worst under both the conditions the pbias statistics for both calibration and validation period lied within the accepted limit as defined by moriasi et al 2007 however with a positive pbias estimates at all the four conditions a constant overestimation of streamflow was replicated throughout the study period this could be due to the non accountability of the significant retention of water inside the paddy fields as standing water during the growth phase of model simulation moreover relatively higher mismatch was observed between the observed and simulated streamflow during the post monsoon period in the meantime this dis agreement between observed and simulated flows got intensified at the mohanpur outlet as the effect of excess irrigation water on streamflow generation was not conceptualized properly by the swat cn model framework as the primary focus of the study is to assess the effect of different simulation approaches over paddy field dynamics the water balance statistics presented here are confined to the paddy cultivation period only the hydrological processes like percolation evapotranspiration lateral flow inside a paddy field are quite different from other land uses furthermore the presence of ponding water leads to a substantial increase in groundwater recharge as per the local farming practice the paddy cultivation period was assumed to be of 131 days duration in the krb during the study period i e from 2003 to 2006 1682 mm of water was lost in the form of percolation inside the paddy hru and percolation rate varied in between 0 and 31 mm day the total amount of et loss in the analysis period was estimated to be 1226 mm which seemed to be lower from that of realistic paddy field et value because of the cn approach the availability of water inside paddy fields decreased and might resulted in reduced et value groundwater recharge showed a delayed response to percolation loss in all the years except 2006 although variations in et and groundwater recharge followed the same pattern the groundwater recharge rate exceeded the et value in the year 2004 and pointed out that very high rainfall had occurred in the paddy hru in the year 2004 a detailed water balance analysis of the paddy hru is illustrated in fig 9 percolation loss was found to be highest during the harvesting phase of paddy cultivation and identifies the severe limitation of cn approach in simulating the percolation process across all the four years in comparison to the upstream paddy fields a reduced percolation rate 0 16 mm day was observed for the irrigated paddy fields this represents the inadequacy of cn approach in replicating the contribution of excess irrigation water towards percolation loss inside the paddy field however an increased magnitude of et 1596 mm was observed and justified the effect of presence of extensive paddy fields in the command area a close observation on groundwater recharge indicates a decrease in its magnitude as compared to the rainfed paddy fields during the four years of study 730 mm of groundwater recharge took place in the mohanpur sub basin and the magnitude of recharge was found to be maximum in the year 2004 the rain fed and irrigated paddy fields showed the similar groundwater recharge pattern and subsequently highlighted the underlying un certainties in the cn approach 5 2 2 streamflow calibration in the existing pothole approach considering real hydrological conditions were highly inconsistent with time the streamflow dynamics was not well reproduced during all the periods by the pothole approach despite the given temporal differences between the analysis years some general streamflow patterns were noticed for all the years figs 4 5 baseflow contribution to streamflow is the highest in the dry periods of model simulation moreover the baseflow contribution was increased substantially after the immediate monsoon period of each year for upland paddy fields nse estimates of 0 59 and 0 65 was observed during calibration and validation periods respectively indicating satisfactory calibration approach the corresponding kge estimates were observed to be 0 61 and 0 65 during calibration and validation periods respectively the uncertainty band captures most of the observed streamflow value with very good accuracy for both calibration and validation periods in reservoir inflow simulation however similar to cn approach a poor simulation outcome was contemplated for the mohanpur outlet wherein the low flows were significantly overestimated figs 6 7 in the validation context for the years 2005 and 2006 most of the peak flows were underestimated resulting in poor nse estimates of 0 49 at the mohanpur outlet the simulation outcomes certainly point towards the poor applicability of the pothole approach over the cn approach the calibrated swat pothole based model was used to estimate the catchment scale water balance of the krb as presented in fig 10 during the analysis period the daily percolation rate varied between 0 and 49 mm day which is significantly greater than the simulated percolation rate in the cn approach subsequently resulting a total of 1723 mm of water to be lost in the form percolation which is slightly higher as compared to the cn approach thus adaptability of pothole approach over the cn approach in a paddy dominant watershed is justified to certain extent percolation value becomes higher when the soil water deficit is maximum followed by an irrigation application event groundwater recharge happens parallel to the percolation process and its magnitude was found to be maximum in the year 2004 fig 10 however a significant contradiction was observed between the variation of groundwater recharge and percolation loss although the percolation rate was high on 8th october 2003 and 5th june 2006 maximum groundwater recharge of 5 mm day was occurred on the 3rd september 2004 thus higher percolation loss contributes less towards groundwater recharge as compared to lower continuous percolation loss values as percolation loss was underestimated to a greater extent the corresponding groundwater recharge 1006 mm that took place during the analysis period was also quite low during intermittent irrigation application release operation is a complimentary process in paddy cultivation moreover during the release period hydrologic phenomenon like percolation evapotranspiration and lateral flow remain active however the swat p module structure does not permit those processes to happen during the release phase resulting in reduced percolation and groundwater recharge during the study period 1672 mm of water was lost in the form of evapotranspiration and the highest magnitude of 5 mm was observed on 3rd july 2006 however smaller un realistic et values of magnitude 0 29 mm day and 0 35 mm day were observed on 1st week of june 2003 and 1st week of june 2004 respectively pointing out the underlying uncertainty associated with the existing pothole module the evaporation process inside the paddy fields is characterized under two heads viz from the ponded water surface and from the soil water however the pothole module does not permit evaporation from soil water under ponded condition and resulting in reduced et estimation at the command region percolation rate reduced significantly and found to be varying between 0 and 19 mm day however the number of zero percolation values reduced to a greater extent and the effect of irrigated paddies was found to be simulated relatively well in the pothole approach as a consequence of reduced percolation loss groundwater recharge also decreased at the mohanpur outlet to a greater extent 5 2 3 streamflow calibration in the revised pothole approach after incorporating the improved hydrologic formulations to the existing pothole approach the model calibration and validation were carried out by the swat ps at the two test locations the revised approach has resulted in marginal increase in nse value during the calibration period of both reservoir inflow and mohanpur outlet however the model performance was not satisfactory during the validation period at mohanpur outlet nse 0 51 moreover significant improvement was observed during the validation phase of reservoir inflow simulation for most of the timescales in the validation period the catchment rainfall runoff dynamics was found to be replicated in a much improved way by the revised swat pothole approach although significant underestimation and overestimation were observed during the validation period of reservoir inflow and mohanpur outlet respectively the water balance statistics of the revised pothole approach varied significantly than the previous two approaches fig 11 in reservoir sub basin the total estimated et loss of 1317 mm showed a moderate response between the cn and the existing pothole approach the activation of soil evaporation process during minimal ponding water depth resulted in slight increase in et value as compared to the cn approach however the number of days having et values below 0 5 mm day has been reduced drastically across all the four years in case of the extreme downstream sub basin the total et magnitude slightly increased to 1467 mm and the et reproduction was almost like the earlier approaches adoption of a constant potential percolation rate of 30 mm day in the swat ps conceptualization has resulted in significant increase in percolation loss for both the locations in case of rain fed paddy fields 2591 mm of water was lost in the form of percolation revealing the sub surface hydrology altered in a complex manner being directly correlated with the percolation process an increased groundwater recharge of 1564 mm was observed for the rain fed paddy condition however the effect of modified irrigation algorithm was reflected on the water balance of lowland paddy fields incorporation of excess irrigation water contribution to the streamflow generation process lead to increased streamflow at the mohanpur sub basin certainly a reduced residence time of excess irrigation water in the paddy fields had resulted only 1334 mm amount of water as percolation loss and subsequently groundwater recharge reduces to 678 mm although the water balance dynamics of paddy field under both rainfed and irrigated condition showed a realistic simulation outcome a lot of physical aspects of are yet to be conceptualized by the swat model in the paddy dominant regions 5 3 validation of swat simulated etact estimates the major water balance components of swat include the actual crop et soil moisture storage percolation loss and baseflow to justify the robustness of the calibrated and validated hydrological model it is quite imperative to check the reproduction of observed water balance components by its simulated counterparts however due to the limited availability of observed information only the etact component was chosen for validation to quantify the reproducibility of etact by individual swat hydrological frameworks the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis based mod16a2 etact data is considered as the benchmark et information and subsequently the spatiotemporal plot of et is in a given paddy hru is presented in fig 12 as envisaged from fig 12 the swat ps reproduces the 8 daily et with a high nse value of 0 42 whereas the swat cn and swat p not performed well as seen from nse estimates of 0 05 and 0 22 respectively while depicting the paddy hru water balance under irrigated condition the swat cn and swat p showed more degree of disagreement with the benchmark etact during the kharif season the poorest being the swat p as evidenced by higher rmse value of 9 67 mm 8 day the swat ps performed the best as envisaged from rmse estimate of 6 43 mm 8 day however like the streamflow representation dynamics of etact is lacking in case of both the swat cn and swat p approaches the non accountability of irrigation return flow in the existing swat cn and swat p variants caused considerable overestimation resulting pbias estimates in the order of 22 4 and 26 3 respectively 6 discussion swat as a process based model is popular for its multi faceted catchment scale applications and in planning various water management activities several past studies carried out using cn approach resulted in very good nse value by conceptualizing the complex catchment processes in a simple manner however the hru level uncertainty caused by those approaches alter micro scale management operations like irrigation requirement pollutant and pesticide loading from paddy fields to great extent the conventional cn approach adopted in this study discriminates the paddy land use from the remaining lulc classes by means of modified cn values completely ignores the effect of standing water and storage occurring inside the paddy fields this leads to highly erroneous outcomes from the swat model similarly the swat p and swat ps although tried to conceptualize the paddy hydrology upon considering the standing water and storage effect most of the process components are conceptualized by means of empirical equations or lumped assumptions moreover the major vadose zone hydrological process alterations under drying and ponding stage of paddy field is completely ignored in their model conceptualization the monthly streamflow simulation in the ken river basin was carried out by using the cn approach represents a very good agreement between observe and simulated streamflow murty et al 2013 du et al 2013 adopted the cn approach for daily streamflow simulation in an agricultural watershed having 2631 km2 area by using both fixed and variable parametrization approach however the concept of variable parameter approach predicted the streamflow with very good accuracy upon exclusively distributing the calibration parameters across the paddy and non paddy hrus the concept of critical depth so introduced to control the irrigation depth and drainage operation in paddy fields lowered the uncertainty associated with streamflow simulation and the model performance improved drastically the swat ps approach was initially applied in the arata river watershed 3 km2 by the sakaguchi et al 2014 and paddy hru scale water balance has been estimated an nse value of 0 73 justifies its improved applicability over the cn approach in paddy dominant regions similarly the application of existing pothole approach in field scale application is found to be performing satisfactorily with nse estimates of 0 87 however applicability of the revised pothole approach for catchment scale streamflow simulation has not been examined the substantial amount of percolation loss is exhibited by all the three simulation approaches in cn approach the paddy field was treated in a similar fashion as that of other land uses where the standing water dynamics on various hydrological fluxes was not simulated effectively moreover the cn approach functions on the concept of antecedent moisture condition amc indicating that under dry condition most of the rainfall contributes to infiltration and subsequently increases the percolation loss gassman et al 2022 however in case of the existing and revised pothole approaches erroneous conceptualization of the vadose zone hydrology could have consequence the poor match between the observed and simulated percolation loss from the paddy fields the downstream location of the catchment mimics the effect of both rain fed and irrigated paddy fields hence a relatively dynamic percolation loss pattern was observed the pothole module is based on the basic assumption that when soil moisture content reaches field capacity percolation process stops from the paddy fields however paddy fields always remain in saturated condition and seepage process happens actively during the growing periods resulting in reduced percolation loss during the saturation phase relatively higher percolation loss by both the swat pothole approaches in comparison to the swat cn approach resulted more groundwater recharge across the paddy going regions which is in line with findings of the study proposed by padhiary et al 2022 the water balance analysis as depicted from the swat ps model revealed that the dominant sub surface hydrologic processes like percolation loss and groundwater recharge gradually reduces and attains a constant rate in conjunction with the previously described two water balance components the swat ps exhibited relatively better 8 daily etact simulation scenario as compared to the swat cn and swat p and in line with the findings by himanshu et al 2022 mostly the hydrological modeling studies are catchment scale in nature for effective implementation of management strategies like flood control irrigation application and hydro power plants etc as scale of application plays a vital role in hydrological modelling it is impractical to say that a single model will be equally effective for both micro scale and macro scale applications every time relying on the adjustment of calibration parameter does not solve the problem associated with simulation of hydrological flux components hence the revised approach has been tested for its suitability in catchment scale applications and possible improvements are identified for implementation in the future studies 6 1 way forward this study attempted to examine the applicability of three model simulation approaches in a paddy dominant agricultural watershed and the shortcomings of individual approaches have been identified the cn approach was unable to quantify the actual amount of seepage loss taking place inside the paddy field and resulted in severe underestimation of streamflow at the final outlet although existing pothole approach estimates the percolation loss during impounding period a difference of 213 mm could be noticed between the observed and simulated percolation loss to overcome these shortcomings attempts made by researchers include incorporation of three critical depths for simulating the overflow from potholes and a constant percolation rate of 1 cm day from ponded paddy field boulange et al 2014 separate quantification of et during dry and wet periods of paddy cultivation controlling irrigation and drainage operation by the critical water depth xie et al 2011 and experimental determination of potential percolation rate for paddy field as well as activating certain hydrological processes during the release phase of paddy field which were not functional in the original algorithm sakaguchi et al 2014 recently apart from streamflow simulation swat model is getting popular for catchment scale assessment of water quality pollutant loading in agricultural regions and urban planning however improper assessment of hydrological fluxes leads to erroneous policy implementation in the desired locations to address these concerns more improvements to the revised pothole module is highly essential and a fully functional swat paddy module is required to be developed the following modifications may improve the accuracy of streamflow prediction in paddy dominant agricultural watersheds by using swat model 1 the return flow caused due to the application of excess irrigation water contributes to streamflow and need to be incorporated properly into the modeling framework 2 in a limited water availability scenario alternate wetting and drying awd is a very popular approach for irrigation application this intermittent irrigation application alters the hydrological fluxes in a different manner than usual way of irrigation application hence the soil moisture content evapotranspiration values need to be estimated accurately under the awd scenario 3 the existing and revised pothole approaches perform poorly in modeling the sub surface hydrological processes as paddy field always remains in a near saturated condition the method for estimating saturated hydraulic conductivity needs to be modified so that the associated hydrological phenomena can be conceptualized in more realistic way these propitious modifications may lead to the development of a fully physical swat paddy module which will be capable of hypothesizing the impoundment effect over streamflow generation and crop yield assessment phenomena in catchment scale applications 7 conclusions this study was proposed to identify the suitable streamflow simulation approach in a paddy dominant agricultural watershed a considerable deviation was observed between actual paddy field hydrology and pothole simulated paddy field hydrology across the catchment based on the findings of the study the following specific conclusions could be drawn 1 the cn approach performed well for rain fed paddy scenarios 0 42 nse 0 63 original pothole approach failed to perform satisfactorily for both the scenarios 0 45 nse 0 62 and the revised pothole approach of model simulation was found to be performing well for irrigated paddy scenario 0 51 nse 0 62 2 the revised pothole approach which has been tested earlier in a field scale application performing better than the original pothole model however the catchment scale hydrological flux quantification is not satisfactory 3 excess irrigation water resulted in substantial amount of return flow while the modeling framework of the pothole module was unable to replicate its additive effect over streamflow generated at the final outlet of the kangsabati river basin 4 both existing and revised pothole module simulation outcomes indicate zero percolation loss most of the time and subsequently the groundwater recharge reduced to a greater extent across the paddy fields the incorrect simulation of percolation loss resulted in higher et value as well as very low value of 0 1 mm day was also observed for certain timescales the outcomes from all the swat streamflow simulation approaches are highly unreliable and may not be adopted directly in the decision making process hence it is quite imperative to develop a fully physical swat paddy module which will be capable of replicating the paddy field dynamics these improvements may yield more favorable environment for water management planning in a paddy growing agricultural watershed and aid in efficient implementation of management policies funding the authors declare that no funds grants or other supports were received during the preparation of this paper declaration
