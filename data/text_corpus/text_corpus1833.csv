9165,this research aimed to evaluate the possible runoff and leaching of atrazine in corn crops during high intensity rainfall and the influence of summer and winter seasons on this herbicide s environmental distribution leaching and suction lysimeters were used with atrazine mobility evaluated during simulated precipitations 24 and 48 h after the atrazine spraying during corn development during the summer and winter seasons for two years adsorption studies at the laboratory were conducted to understand soil adsorption better the kd and koc at 25 ºc of 2 59 l kg 1 and 281 64 l kg 1 indicate moderate atrazine retention with soil adsorption being exothermic reversible and spontaneous multilayer adsorption of atrazine is enhanced by soil organic matter by about 20 3 during winter atrazine retention in soil increases by 2 2x while its loss by runoff and leaching decreases by 6 75 and 3 0x losses by runoff during rainfall simulations are 14 5x greater at 24 h than 48 h after spray while atrazine loss by leaching is 1 7x greater at 48 h than 24 h after spray runoff or leached water contained much higher levels of atrazine than the acceptable national or international standards for drinking water natural waters or effluent discharge indicating that extreme weather could increase environmental contamination keywords contamination process herbicide application environment monitoring corn production data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the use of pesticides in agriculture has become a significant concern due to the environmental impacts and the damage caused to different living organisms pereira et al 2021 herbicides are the most widely used pesticides globally representing 40 of the pesticides consumed followed by fungicides at 33 insecticides at 10 and others at 17 glinski et al 2018 in this scenario atrazine is an herbicide widely used in weed control in many crops worldwide i e one of the main molecules regarding usage anket sharma et al 2019 however when mismanaged atrazine can contaminate different environmental compartments with its residues and metabolites dou et al 2020 for example atrazine is the most used herbicide detected in surface waters souza et al 2020 detected in rainfall soil and groundwater potter and coffin 2017 salazar ledesma et al 2018 atrazine 6 chloro n2 ethyl n4 isopropyl 1 3 5 triazine 2 3 diamine is an organochlorine from the triazine family it is a selective systemic herbicide classified as pre and post emergent it has been used since the 1950 s to control weeds mainly in the crops of corn zea mays l sorghum sorghum spp and sugar cane saccharum officinarum lebaron et al 2008 according to souza et al 2020 atrazine has a symmetrical molecular structure strong hydrophobicity and low solubility making it persistent in aqueous matrices especially in subterraneous sites according to the agency for toxic substances and disease registry in groundwater atrazine can persist for more than 200 days agency for toxic substances and disease registry 2003 the significant volume sprayed of atrazine its high mobility in certain types of soils its longer half life and its high persistence under reducing conditions solomon et al 2013 can explain to a certain extent atrazine spread to different environmental compartments after being disseminated in the environment numerous factors can influence its fate depending on the chemical physical and biological changes in environmental conditions usman et al 2014 bedmar et al 2015 weeds do not absorb all sprayed atrazine thus the unabsorbed part can reach surface waters through runoff or suffer leaching to deeper soil profile layers compromising groundwater quality usman et al 2014 besides atrazine can be subjected to chemical and or biological degradation processes generating metabolites or degradates such as deethylatrazine and deisopropylatrazine that can cause problems for aquatic organisms odukkathil and vasudevan 2013 ralston hooper et al 2009 also depending on the physicochemical properties of soils and atrazine retention reactions with the soil particles from organic organic matter and inorganic clays nature are possible schwantes et al 2020 yue et al 2017 on the other hand extreme rainfall events are becoming more frequent with climate change which can also influence the fate of atrazine this observation justifies the need for studies evaluating atrazine dynamics under extreme conditions in south america phenomena such as la niña and el niño present more evident effects on agriculture practices and according to noaa the tendency is that their impacts will be intensified by climate change stein 2020 according to fernandes and grimm 2022 these phenomena are the primary source of interannual climate variation in south america and have been associated with extreme rainfall events floods and droughts in several regions of the continent wahiduzzaman et al 2022 fernandes and grimm 2022 climate change alters rainfall patterns mondal et al 2016 global temperature and atmospheric moisture mullan et al 2012 the addition of water vapor in the atmosphere influences climate circulation patterns modifying extreme rainfall events intensity frequency and incidence in tropical climate regions of brazil temperature and extreme rainfall events tend to be more frequent alves et al 2020 mondal et al 2016 hegerl et al 2004 these events could impact atrazine dissipation and increase surface and groundwater contamination therefore in this study we aimed to evaluate the mobility of atrazine in lysimeter cultivated with corn and the possibility of surface and groundwater contamination furthermore the work aims to respond to the following unsolved questions 1 the soil organic matter content is the foremost responsible for atrazine retention in a rhodic ferralsol furthermore 2 the distribution of atrazine in environmental matrices is affected by seasons summer and winter crops in south brazilian conditions 3 to what extent extreme tropical conditions such as high intensity rainfall and high temperatures can affect atrazine losses by runoff and leaching 4 high intensity rainfalls 24 and 48 h after spray could promote significant losses of atrazine by runoff or leaching compromising the water quality according to national and international standards and 5 to what extent the development stages of corn can influence the atrazine mobility thus seeking to solve such questions the present investigation aimed i to assess the role of soil organic matter in the retention of atrazine by a rhodic ferralsol in laboratory studies ii to evaluate the mobility of atrazine after successive spraying and intense rainfall simulations in corn grown in rhodic ferralsol iii to determine the possible influence that the seasons summer and winter crop have on the environmental dynamics of atrazine on field experiments and iv to determinate the possible relations between corn development on herbicide mobility in superficial runoff and leached water aiming to improve atrazine agronomic recommendations 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the field study was conducted using a leaching lysimeter marechal cândido rondon state of paraná south of brazil under the geographic coordinates latitude 24 558086 s longitude 54 045745 w and 471 m of altitude figure s1a and s1b environmental conditions of the studied period were obtained from a nearby weather automatic station figures s2 a composite sampling was performed to evaluate the granulometric and chemical characteristics of the soil this procedure was performed at depths of 0 20 and 20 40 cm the soil characterization was performed by determining total density and porosity teixeira et al 2017 2 2 lysimeter station the lysimeter was made of acrylic material 8 mm thick and with a 1 m² base containing an undisturbed soil sample of 1 m³ the sample is isolated laterally and at the bottom not allowing exchanges with the soil that gave rise to it in the downstream wall of the lysimeter close to the soil surface two holes are connected through flanges for runoff and leaching sampling in addition suction lysimeters were installed at different depths 20 30 40 50 and 60 cm outside the leaching lysimeter over the lysimeters a rain simulator was installed allowing precipitation intensity control 2 3 crop production the study area was cultivated with corn hybrid ns 50 pro the seeds were distributed at a depth of 3 5 cm adopting spacing between lines of 50 cm with three seeds sown per linear meter 65 000 plants ha 1 using the conventional sowing system hero zeta cypermethrin 20 w v 1 bifenthrin 18 w v 1 was sprayed at 200 l ha 1 to control spodoptera frugiperda and dichelops furcatus weed control was carried out according to necessity through manual weeding the corn crop and atrazine sprays were evaluated four times for two years from october 2018 to july 2020 encompassing four cropping seasons summer and winter therefore we will reference the crop s first and second years summer and winter seasons weather conditions precipitation and temperature are shown in figure s2 finally agricultural correctives and fertilizers were carried out through physical and chemical soil analysis and the estimates for maximum yield according to the manual of fertilization and liming for the state of paraná sbcs 2017 2 4 spraying and sampling after the corn emergence spraying of atrazine siptroil 40 w v 1 was carried out using 5 0 l ha 1 of the commercial product as recommended by the label the physicochemical characteristics of atrazine the essential criteria for pesticide classification and their final fate are shown in tables s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 and s6 weekly spraying of atrazine was carried out until the phenological stage v7 about 40 days after plants emergence dae coinciding with the critical period of weed interference cpwi of corn the period in which these invasive plants must be controlled to avoid productivity reduction i e the period in which the crop cannot suffer any weed interference figure s5 it also coincides with the most critical crop period concerning the attack of pests and consequent higher insecticide spraying at each crop summer and winter atrazine was sprayed six times in addition rainfall simulation at 24 and 48 h was conducted after each spray therefore four corn crops summer and winter in two years x 2 conditions of rainfall simulations 24 and 48 h after atrazine spray x 7 moments of sprays for each crop i e seven replicates in different phenological stages being only the last without atrazine spray i e 4 2x7 56 rainfall simulations in total more details of the experimental scheme are described in table 1 each rain simulation corresponded to high intensity rainfall events 150 mm h 1 whose frequency of occurrence is low nevertheless crucial in studies that evaluate the environmental dynamics of pesticides especially concerning south american conditions and predictions on climate change each rain simulation lasted 60 min being the runoff and leached samples collected at 5 min intervals these were stored in polyethylene bottles packed in thermal insulation boxes and transported to the laboratory for immediate analysis as described by queiroz et al 2011 and pinheiro et al 2013 the rainfall simulation tests were performed using a rain simulator similar to that described by meyer and harmon 1979 the simulator was installed 2 00 m above the ground and fed through a submerged pump with constant pressure the water used in the rain simulation came from a drinking water source near the stimulation site a spray nozzle of the type veejet 80 100 was used to simulate rainfall with characteristics similar to natural rainfall generating 150 mm h 1 the pressure used during the simulations was monitored and controlled using a manometer in addition a calibration was performed before every rainfall simulation for that purpose a rainfall intensity calibration was performed using a 1 21 m2 zinc box with 0 10 m height the flow rate obtained for runoff and leaching water from rainfall simulations is shown in figures s7a and s7b the leaching potential of atrazine to groundwater was carried out using the gus groundwater ubiquity score index gustafson 1989 to compare the field results with theoretical indexes the goss method was used goss 1992 to evaluate the transport potential of atrazine associated with sediments or dissolved in water for surface or groundwater 2 5 laboratory analysis 2 5 1 soil characterization the soil samples were characterized by physicochemical analysis at the laboratory of environmental and instrumental chemistry belonging to the study group on soil and environment the granulometric analysis of soil samples for textural classification was performed using the pipette method described by claessen 1997 the soil fertility attributes were evaluated according to the methods described by the soil chemical analysis manual and their recommendations for the state of paraná pavan et al 1992 finally the soil density was obtained using the volumetric cylinder method teixeira et al 2017 2 5 2 atrazine sorption capacity in rhodic ferralsol a laboratory study 2 5 2 1 experimental design the adsorption of pesticides in soils can be explained to a certain extent by their relationship with the soil organic matter therefore the role of soil organic matter in the retention of atrazine in rhodic ferralsol was assessed in laboratory studies by two treatments 1 rhodic ferralsol samples in their natural form i e with an organic matter content of 17 09 g dm 3 and 2 calcined rhodic ferralsol samples i e without organic matter for that purpose soil samples were dried in an oven with forced air circulation at 105 ºc for 48 h and the particles were standardized 2 0 mm after that a subsample of 500 g of rhodic ferralsol was taken and heated at 500 ºc for 5 h in a muffle furnace nova técnica nt 380 1200 ºc using porcelain capsules to obtain soil without organic matter nguyen et al 2022 2 5 2 2 adsorption studies equilibrium and thermodynamics in erlenmeyer flasks of 125 ml 10 0 g of soil from each treatment calcined and with natural organic matter content were weighted and set in contact with 50 ml of atrazine solution with 0 2 5 10 15 20 and 25 mg l 1 of atrazine pestanal sigma aldrich lot bcbr7544v then the erlenmeyer flasks were stirred for two hours in a dubnoff shaker yu et al 2020 at 5 30 and 35 ºc subsequently samples were centrifuged filtered and liquid liquid extraction was performed using the proportion 1 10 1 5 ml of tertiary butyl methyl ether mtbe to 15 ml of sampled water 3 nacl salting out effect and stirred on a vibrax shaker vxr ika at 1000 rpm for two hours after that following the methodology proposed by the united states environmental protection agency epa 8141 usepa 2007 figures s3a s3b s4a and s4b samples were taken to gc ecd to determine the remaining atrazine concentration ct or ce and to estimate the adsorbed amount qt or qe eq 1 the obtained data were analyzed using the nonlinear empirical models of langmuir and freundlich langmuir 1918 freundlich 1906 eqs 2 and 3 figure s6 1 in addition the thermodynamic parameters gº hº and sº were obtained by analyzing the isotherms in different

wilk normality test and bartlett homogeneity test through the sisvar ferreira 2014 in addition statistica version 7 0 statsoft was used to construct response surface graphs of atrazine environmental dynamics as the data did not show normality a descriptive analysis was performed with response surface graphs 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil characterization table 2 shows some characteristics of the studied rhodic ferralsol in the 0 20 cm layer the soil has a clayey texture ph of 5 77 and average organic matter content a high percentage of clay mainly iron oxides such as hematite is found in the 20 40 cm layer which characterizes the soil with a clay texture in addition the soil has a high ph and low organic matter content sbcs 2017 the results obtained in its layers are similar regarding physical and chemical attributes as a rhodic ferralsol it is deep with very homogeneous characteristics and profile especially its textural parameters santos et al 2013 according to table 2 3 2 atrazine sorption capacity in rhodic ferralsol a laboratory study table 3 exhibits the adsorption of atrazine in rhodic ferralsol adjusted by the models of langmuir and freundlich it is essential to state that the atrazine adsorption data could not be adjusted by langmuir nonlinear model at 15 ºc and 25 ºc while the goodness of fit obtained for the freundlich model allowed it estimates of all adsorption parameters in the evaluated temperature range the mean absorption coefficients obtained at 25 ºc were kd 2 59 l kg 1 and koc 281 64 l kg 1 which are close to the values obtained by lopes et al 2011 and schmidt et al 2015 with koc varying from 37 a 104 l kg 1 the interactions between factors such as rainfall temperature variations especially from summer to winter the biological activity of the soil the crop management no tillage can play a significant influence on the soil organic matter and therefore influence the koc values justifying the variation found on table 3 kookana et al 2010 oliver et al 2003 also reported that in 43 west australian surface soil samples the koc values ranged from 36 to 910 for atrazine these variations can occur due to the differences in organic matter characteristics humic substance types and their content environment temperature between summer and winter and other edaphoclimatic properties according to fig 1 the adsorption maximum capacity predicted by langmuir qlangmuir decreases with the increase in temperature 15 ºc 0 069 30 ºc 0 045 and 35 ºc 0 032 mg g 1 kfreundlich values present the same tendency 15 ºc 0 080 20 ºc 0 053 25 ºc 0 036 30 ºc 0 042 and 35 ºc 0 025 mg g 1 this behavior indicates that atrazine molecules desorb from the soil colloid interface due to increased temperature and randomness yu et al 2020 also observed a decrease in qlangmuir and kfreundlich due to temperature rise yu et al 2020 found kfreundlich values inferior to 5 mg g 1 mg l 1 1 n which according to the authors indicates that atrazine has a weak soil sorption capacity similarly kfreundlich values were inferior to the unity atrazine could present high mobility in the soil water environment with possible leaching to deeper soil layers with consequent contamination of groundwater according to the goodness of the fit obtained for freundlich figures s7a and s7b and table 3 atrazine adsorption occurs in a multilayer moreover the decrease in the adsorption rates due to the temperature increase indicates an exothermic process according to δhº values 0 the low entropy values δsº 48 215 kj mol 1 suggest a reversible adsorption process while δgº values 0 suggest a spontaneous adsorption process the following nfreundlich values were found in each temperature range 2 96 15 ºc 5 46 20 ºc 4 47 25 ºc 4 23 30 ºc 7 89 35 ºc i e between 1 and 10 which indicates favorable adsorption of atrazine by the rhodic ferralsol colloids moreover 1 n values were distant and inferior to one 0 33 at 15 ºc 0 18 at 20 ºc 0 22 at 25 ºc 0 23 at 30 ºc and 0 12 at 35 ºc indicating that atrazine adsorption is not linear i e the energy is not the same for every adsorption site similar results are reported by yue et al 2017 in three different chinese soils laterite paddy and alluvial soils the authors mentioned above show atrazine adsorption by soil particles with 1 n values varying from 0 58 to 0 88 according to the goodness of the fit obtained for freundlich atrazine adsorption occurs in a multilayer moreover the low entropy values δsº 48 215 kj mol 1 suggest a reversible adsorption process while δgº values 0 suggest a spontaneous adsorption process yu et al 2020 found similar results studying two chinese soils from wanzhou and wushan according to the authors the atrazine sorption is spontaneous δgº varying from 0 849 to 0 222 kj mol k 1 and exothermic δhº varying from 5 38 to 9 27 kj mol 1 in contrast yue et al 2017 found atrazine adsorption in laterite paddy and alluvial soils with positive δhº values varying from 22 34 to 42 44 kj mol 1 and with decreasing values of δgº varying from 1 15 to 3 31 kj mol 1 according to the authors δgº decreased with the increasing temperature agreeing with the assumption of an endothermic adsorption process which leads to atrazine sorption onto the soil surface more favorably in higher temperatures these results show us that the behavior of polar pesticides such as atrazine can vary depending on edaphoclimatic conditions therefore it is crucial to continue to study such issues for a deeper understanding of the interactions between soil particles and xenobiotics for the calcined soil samples i e with no soil organic matter som it was impossible to construct any isotherm langmuir or freundlich in the function of imperfect correlations and to the meager obtained adsorption rates figures s7 1 and s7 2 this result may strongly indicate that the interactions between atrazine and organic matter in soil may significantly affect this pesticide retention as observed in figure 8 the som plays a significant role in the atrazine adsorption in the studied rhodic ferralsol with a mean 20 3 higher retention of atrazine in the samples with a natural organic matter content 17 09 g dm 3 figure s8 nevertheless calcinated soil samples also presented a significant adsorption percentage which indicates that 53 of clay mainly iron oxides such as hematite usually in great quantities in rhodic ferralsol can play a significant role in atrazine retention 3 3 transport of atrazine on corn grown during the season summer of 1st and 2nd year the destination and transport of pesticides in soils are subject to complex interactions between many physical chemical and biological processes steffens et al 2013 figure s6 illustrates the corn growth stage during the spray of atrazine while figs 2 and 3 and table s7 show the concentrations of atrazine from runoff and leached samples during rain simulations in summer and winter corn crops in two years of evaluation as observed in the season crop summer atrazine residues in runoff and leaching were detected 24 and 48 h after herbicide applications while for off season crops winter atrazine was not transported in the same proportion the atrazine concentrations in runoff 24 h and 48 h observed in fig 2 are associated with the higher empty space between plants during the first stages of the corn plants i e in those corn growth stages the gaps between rows could significative increase runoff by soil erosion also in advanced corn growth stages atrazine concentrations decrease substantially most likely due to the increase of biomass on the surface which protects the soil from runoff the leachate samples 24 h and 48 h demonstrate no uniformity in atrazine concentrations during the sampling periods 5 50 min of rainfall simulation moreover it is worth noting that even with the development of corn plants high concentrations of atrazine were found in percolate samples table s7 summarizes the pesticide concentrations found in summer in samples of runoff and leaching during the rainfall simulations applied 24 and 48 h after atrazine spray atrazine detection reached 100 of the evaluated samples during the first year while in the 2nd year the detection frequency was on average only 1 during the first year of study the highest concentration of atrazine was found in runoff 24 h after the pesticide application the value obtained is approximately 5649 µg l 1 around 2824 times higher than the maximum allowed value vmp by consolidation ordinance no 5 of 28 september 2017 from the ministry of health which is 2 0 µg l 1 brasil 2017 with the same value established by conama in resolution nº 357 brasil 2005 for water bodies the detected value is also higher than the maximum limits established for detecting atrazine in drinking water of 3 0 µg l 1 in the usa and 0 1 µg l 1 in the european union european comission 1998 bethsass and colangelo 2006 usepa 2020 it is worth mentioning that the physical and chemical properties of the molecule play a fundamental role in the dynamics of the pesticide on the environment for example although atrazine has a molecular weight of 215 68 g mol 1 low medium solubility in water at 20ºc 35 mg l 1 log koc 100 this herbicide is a very weak base due to its low dissociation constant pka 1 7 and log kow of 2 75 baranowska et al 2008 iupac 2018 which favor its runoff and leaching in certain soil conditions the atrazine found on the surface and groundwater may be more related to its kow 2 75 and logkoc observed among 3 63 3 10 suggesting a high leaching potential carmo et al 2013 furthermore koc estimates the tendency of pesticide partition in the liquid phase for organic matter in the soil pedroso and neto 2018 thus indicating the herbicide s affinity with soil organic carbon oliveira and brighenti 2011 as already evidenced in our results section 3 3 both parameters kow and logkoc are relevant since the sorption values are directly related to the retention of the molecule in the soil which makes it possible to infer its final fate oliveira and brighenti 2011 it is worth mentioning that the interaction of atrazine with soil particles also depends on its solubility in water and the sediment s characteristics such as the amount of organic matter clay and ph dellamatrice and monteiro 2014 for example the studied rhodic ferralsols have high clay and organic matter table 2 nevertheless with atrazine s low medium solubility low kow and low koc little interaction between atrazine and soil colloids is observed see previous results in section 3 3 thus atrazine fate by leaching and runoff is favored with the highest atrazine amount found 24 h after the herbicide spraying table s7 according to a study conducted by dores et al 2008 triazines have great potential for contamination of ground and surface water due to their low medium solubility persistence in the environment and low adsorption to the soil schmidt et al 2015 evaluated the sorption and desorption of thiamethoxam and atrazine under different management systems using a dystrophic rhodic ferralsol of clayey texture with low som content their results show that the soil presented low retention of atrazine with little influence of som and soil management on atrazine soil retention facilitating the transport of atrazine by leaching and runoff lima et al 2020 while evaluating the effects of liming and phosphate fertilizer on the adsorption and mobility of atrazine also found more significant atrazine transportation by leaching and runoff processes a higher atrazine concentration was found in runoff samples in the first days after spraying in the abovementioned study however in leaching samples the presence of atrazine was detected in a lower proportion than in runoff samples the occurrence of lower losses by leaching may be related to more significant atrazine losses through surface runoff mendes et al 2019 found similar results when evaluating the transport of atrazine in agricultural soil of clay texture in laboratory conditions according to the authors atrazine was not detected in leached water below 30 cm however atrazine presence was found in the 0 10 cm soil layer suggesting little vertical mobility but a greater risk of transport via runoff it is worth mentioning that during the 2nd year atrazine was detected only in runoff samples 24 h after spraying in the other simulation events atrazine was not detected in runoff or leaching samples this reduction on atrazine during the sampling periods 5 60 min and dae may be associated with the closing of space between plants during corn development figure s6 which reduces exposed soil area to pesticide spraying and also reduces the intensity of raindrops on the soil surface for runoff after 48 h and leaching samples 24 and 48 h after spraying the absence of the atrazine in the analyzed samples is verified lower natural rainfall was observed 130 mm during the 2nd year of the summer crop which could theoretically cause a lower presence of atrazine in the soil solution and therefore the rainfall simulations could not be sufficient to cause significant leaching the maximum atrazine found was 5097 µg l 1 in runoff 24 h after application this result corroborates with the first study in which the maximum concentration of atrazine is 5647 µg l 1 it is important to note that as previously mentioned atrazine usually adheres to the first layers of the soil 0 30 cm by affinity with organic matter on the surface the highest concentrations are mainly detected in runoff 24 h after spraying and not after 48 h since atrazine is retained by the mineral and organic fraction of the soil in the top layers of the soil profile and then carried by runoff and erosion processes these values are mainly detected in the initial samples first sampling periods and during the first days after corn emergence suggesting a cumulative effect from the previous study however it should be noted that despite the little interaction between atrazine and the soil the pesticide is partially retained mainly by iron oxides and som furthermore according to other studies atrazine has little vertical mobility in the soil usually detected in soil samples between 0 30 cm which favors its degradation by microorganisms paula et al 2016 salazar ledesma et al 2018 mendes et al 2019 according to udiković kolić et al 2012 biological degradation is considered the major transformation route of atrazine therefore the repeated spraying of atrazine in the same place can promote the selection of microorganisms that can use these molecules as a growth substrate resulting in a significant increase in its degradation rhine et al 2003 udiković kolić et al 2011 singh and singh 2016 this phenomenon corroborates the observed data since in the second year summer crop a reduction in the atrazine detection was found compared to the first study suggesting the selectivity of microorganisms after successive spraying of pesticide and atrazine biodegradation fungi bacteria actinomycetes and other microorganisms use pesticides in their metabolic processes like carbon and energy sources nawaz et al 2010 some atrazine degrading bacteria are well known one of them is pseudomonas sp adp strain can decompose atrazine and transform it into nh3 and co2 through the action of enzymes siripattanakul et al 2009 udiković kolić et al 2012 these organisms are widespread in the soil cultivated with different vegetal species in brazilian states braz et al 2018 another well characterized strain whose metabolic pathway is different from pseudomonas sp adp strain is arthrobacter aurescens tc 1 which can metabolize atrazine to cyanuric acid through a degrading pathway that occurs through enzymes udiković kolić et al 2012 fernandes et al 2020 conducted a study in a brazilian rhodic ferralsol to verify the influence of the spraying of atrazine on the soil microbial community they report the microbiota s ability to quickly adapt to atrazine after initial exposure by increasing atrazine biodegradation genes these could explain our findings as atrazine was never used in this experimental land before our evaluations therefore microbiota adaptation could explain why the atrazine loss by runoff and leaching is higher in the first summer crop hang et al 2010 carried out studies with lysimeters in two types of argentine soil to assess the mobility of atrazine and the possibility of contamination of aquifers by the above authors the transport of atrazine decreases thought time after its spraying and the highest atrazine concentration in percolating water was detected in the first 30 days after spraying the pesticide therefore the critical period related to the possible groundwater and surface contamination may be associated with precipitation events close to the moment of atrazine spraying and in the first days after corn emergence as highlighted by our findings fig 2 and table s7 3 4 transport of atrazine on corn grown during the offseason winter of 1st and 2nd year fig 3 and table s7 illustrate the concentrations of atrazine obtained in runoff and leached samples during rain simulations on corn cultivated during winter 1st and 2nd year atrazine was only detected in runoff samples 24 h after spraying no atrazine was detected in runoff samples after 48 h of spraying also atrazine was not found in leaching samples after 24 or 48 h after spraying being this behavior is observed in the 1st and 2nd winter crops numerous factors could explain this behavior firstly lower temperatures down to 2 4 ºc were observed during the evaluated period which could affect water viscosity and therefore cause a reduction in the leaching of atrazine secondly as these results were obtained from a succession of corn crops from the summer season the soil microbiota is probably adapted to this type of pesticide therefore biodegradation of atrazine could partially explain the lower runoff and leaching of the pesticide the higher atrazine levels were found in runoff samples 24 h after spray during the initial sampling periods from 1 to 8 and 38 43 dae the value obtained is approximately 422 µg l 1 about 211x higher than the maximum allowed value vmp by consolidation ordinance no 5 of 28 september 2017 from the ministry of health which is 2 0 µg l 1 brasil 2017 with the same value established by conama brasil 2005 furthermore the detected values are higher than the maximum limits established for detecting atrazine in drinking water of 3 0 µg l 1 in the usa and the european union 0 1 µg l 1 european comission 1998 bethsass and colangelo 2006 usepa 2020 however it is noteworthy that the detection frequency was only 3 with most samples showing values below the limit of quantification 1 5 µg l 1 nevertheless it is essential to consider that some amount of atrazine might have been transported through runoff or leaching in concentrations below the detection limit as the maximum value detected was 1054 µg l 1 i e 527x higher than the vmp by the brazilian ministry of health brasil 2017 conama brasil 2005 for both the maximum acceptable values is 2 0 µg l 1 and higher than permitted values for drinking water in the usa 3 0 µg l 1 usepa 2020 however it is noteworthy that the mean frequency of detections was only 3 with most samples showing values below loq 1 497 µg l 1 moreover the smaller number of detections and reduced concentrations of atrazine found in runoff and leaching samples from the winter corn season may be related to favorable climatic conditions for biological degradation performance such as temperature and rainfall in addition as reported in the bibliography the possibility of selecting microorganisms and increasing the degradation capacity due to successive spraying of the pesticide in the study area rhine et al 2003 udiković kolić et al 2011 singh and singh 2016 in general a higher frequency of detections and concentrations of atrazine were found in runoff volumes in a study by almagro et al 2017 the potential impacts of climate change on rainfall erosivity in brazil were evaluated using baseline data 1961 2005 and projected precipitation data 2007 2099 according to the results there is a possible increase in rainfall erosivity in the south region of brazil it may affect a significant portion of brazil s agricultural production due to increased soil loss rates and decreased soil fertility and water availability in addition water contamination may increase as a result since the most significant load of atrazine is transported by runoff 3 5 atrazine detection by the suction lysimeters suction lysimeters were installed at 20 30 40 50 and 60 cm depths none of the studies detected atrazine in the water volumes sampled at these depths this absence of atrazine detection may be related to the physicochemical interactions of its molecule with soil colloids mineral and organic matter and the limitation of the detection method it is important to note that this result corroborates what was previously mentioned since atrazine is mainly transported by runoff or is quickly leached in depth 1 m other authors have already reported this behavior in similar experimental conditions salazar ledesma et al 2018 mendes et al 2019 3 6 possibility of leaching and runoff of atrazine residues at the end of corn crops the persistence of pesticides in the environment is related to how these substances remain in various matrices and environmental compartments therefore any substance resulting from its spraying including metabolites and the molecule itself are considered pesticide residues oliveira and regitano 2009 at the end of the crop cycle a rain simulation was carried out 80 days after the last spraying to evaluate the possible transportation of atrazine residues and the possibility of contamination of surface and underground waters the obtained atrazine concentrations in runoff and leaching samples 80 days after the last spray in both studies 1st and 2nd years of evaluation showed no detection of atrazine at 120 dae and 80 days after the last spraying with values below the limit of quantification 1 497 µg l 1 this result is expected since the half life of atrazine is approximately 75 days however it is worth mentioning that some atrazine was transported by runoff leaching and a significant part was probably partly absorbed by corn plants biodegraded by the soil microbiota or retained by soil colloids similar behavior is reported by salazar ledesma et al 2018 who detected atrazine in leaching water up to two months after its spraying paula et al 2016 found a significant reduction in atrazine concentration in leached water according to the time after spraying moreover atrazine was detected up to 40 days after the spraying of the commercial product no longer being detected after hang et al 2010 observed that the highest atrazine concentration was leached up to 30 days after spraying according to paula et al 2016 when evaluating the leaching and persistence of atrazine in a red yellow rhodic ferralsol atrazine presents a potential groundwater risk of contamination first however it is crucial to consider this molecule has low persistence 3 7 environmental distribution of atrazine guss and goss indexes estimates guss and goss indexes are essential tools to estimate the potential for pesticide transport by leaching and runoff the guss index can help rank high mobility pesticides and classify their groundwater contamination risk at the same time the goss model indicates the risk of transportation of pesticides by runoff i e their transportation via water and sediments which can help rank molecules with high surface mobility and their risk regarding surface water contamination the results obtained in this study corroborate the trend estimated by the guss index and goss models table s1 in a simplified way when analyzing the analytical results of the four conducted crops it is noted that the presence of atrazine was detected in both runoff and percolate flow especially in intense precipitation shortly after spraying the herbicide a more significant number of detections can be observed in the runoff demonstrating that the molecule can be easily transported in water or moderately transported when associated with sediments as predicted by the goss model nevertheless analyzing the data obtained during four crops 2 summer and 2 winter seasons it is observed that 13 1 of atrazine is retained in the soil 4 7 is transported by runoff and 1 3 is leached below 1 m depth fig 4d shows that 81 0 of atrazine was probably absorbed by plants corn and weeds then metabolized biodegraded by soil microorganisms and suffered photodegradation xiaozhen et al 2005 hydrolysis or other non evaluated pathways nevertheless considering the high intense rainfall i e extreme weather simulated conditions the 13 1 and the 4 7 of atrazine transported by runoff and leaching can cause severe surface and groundwater contamination moreover most of the detections are higher than national and international standards fig 4a shows that soil retention is 2 2x higher during winter crops these estimates considered the maximum adsorption capacity obtained by kfreundlich at 15 ºc and 25 ºc section 3 3 moreover runoff and leaching are facilitated during summer crops probably due to high temperatures higher water viscosity and more rainy weather among other factors the mean values of atrazine transported by runoff are about 14x higher if there is a rain of 150 mm h 1 within 24 h of the spray fig 4b while the leaching of atrazine is 1 7x higher in 48 h compared to 24 h after spray another important observation is that during the 2nd year of evaluation other non evaluated pathways such as atrazine in the soil profile and still in motion plant absorption biodegradation and volatilization among others had a substantial increase 8 6 probably due to the change in soil microbiota which enhanced the biodegradation of atrazine 4 conclusion the obtained results reveal kd mean at 25 c 11 68 l kg 1 koc mean at 25 c 1266 07 l kg 1 and kfreundlich mean at 25 ºc 0 036 mg g 1 mg l 1 1 n adsorption coefficients close to previous reports from literature for atrazine retention by rhodic ferralsol and other soil classes moreover the atrazine sorption capacity decreases with temperature suggesting an exothermic process δhº values 0 the low entropy values suggest a reversible adsorption process δsº 48 215 kj mol 1 while the δgº values 0 suggest a spontaneous process the results obtained using freundlich isotherm suggests multilayer atrazine adsorption by rhodic ferralsol enhanced by the soil organic matter by 20 3 in the evaluated conditions in winter atrazine adsorption by soil increases by 2 2x while atrazine loss by runoff and leaching decreases by 6 75 and 3 0x the losses of atrazine by runoff during rainfall simulation 150 mm h 1 are 14 5x greater after 24 h spray than 48 h while atrazine lost by leaching is 1 7x greater 48 h than 24 h after spray the atrazine concentrations in runoff can be associated with space between plants during the first stages of the corn crop the runoff or leached water contained atrazine levels much higher than national or international standards for drinking water natural waters or effluent discharge our results highlight the importance of implementing soil conservation techniques such as the no till system and the great concern that weather forecasts should have in the plan of pesticide spray in the extreme weather conditions evaluated in our experiment atrazine application on corn crops can increase the

9165,this research aimed to evaluate the possible runoff and leaching of atrazine in corn crops during high intensity rainfall and the influence of summer and winter seasons on this herbicide s environmental distribution leaching and suction lysimeters were used with atrazine mobility evaluated during simulated precipitations 24 and 48 h after the atrazine spraying during corn development during the summer and winter seasons for two years adsorption studies at the laboratory were conducted to understand soil adsorption better the kd and koc at 25 ºc of 2 59 l kg 1 and 281 64 l kg 1 indicate moderate atrazine retention with soil adsorption being exothermic reversible and spontaneous multilayer adsorption of atrazine is enhanced by soil organic matter by about 20 3 during winter atrazine retention in soil increases by 2 2x while its loss by runoff and leaching decreases by 6 75 and 3 0x losses by runoff during rainfall simulations are 14 5x greater at 24 h than 48 h after spray while atrazine loss by leaching is 1 7x greater at 48 h than 24 h after spray runoff or leached water contained much higher levels of atrazine than the acceptable national or international standards for drinking water natural waters or effluent discharge indicating that extreme weather could increase environmental contamination keywords contamination process herbicide application environment monitoring corn production data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the use of pesticides in agriculture has become a significant concern due to the environmental impacts and the damage caused to different living organisms pereira et al 2021 herbicides are the most widely used pesticides globally representing 40 of the pesticides consumed followed by fungicides at 33 insecticides at 10 and others at 17 glinski et al 2018 in this scenario atrazine is an herbicide widely used in weed control in many crops worldwide i e one of the main molecules regarding usage anket sharma et al 2019 however when mismanaged atrazine can contaminate different environmental compartments with its residues and metabolites dou et al 2020 for example atrazine is the most used herbicide detected in surface waters souza et al 2020 detected in rainfall soil and groundwater potter and coffin 2017 salazar ledesma et al 2018 atrazine 6 chloro n2 ethyl n4 isopropyl 1 3 5 triazine 2 3 diamine is an organochlorine from the triazine family it is a selective systemic herbicide classified as pre and post emergent it has been used since the 1950 s to control weeds mainly in the crops of corn zea mays l sorghum sorghum spp and sugar cane saccharum officinarum lebaron et al 2008 according to souza et al 2020 atrazine has a symmetrical molecular structure strong hydrophobicity and low solubility making it persistent in aqueous matrices especially in subterraneous sites according to the agency for toxic substances and disease registry in groundwater atrazine can persist for more than 200 days agency for toxic substances and disease registry 2003 the significant volume sprayed of atrazine its high mobility in certain types of soils its longer half life and its high persistence under reducing conditions solomon et al 2013 can explain to a certain extent atrazine spread to different environmental compartments after being disseminated in the environment numerous factors can influence its fate depending on the chemical physical and biological changes in environmental conditions usman et al 2014 bedmar et al 2015 weeds do not absorb all sprayed atrazine thus the unabsorbed part can reach surface waters through runoff or suffer leaching to deeper soil profile layers compromising groundwater quality usman et al 2014 besides atrazine can be subjected to chemical and or biological degradation processes generating metabolites or degradates such as deethylatrazine and deisopropylatrazine that can cause problems for aquatic organisms odukkathil and vasudevan 2013 ralston hooper et al 2009 also depending on the physicochemical properties of soils and atrazine retention reactions with the soil particles from organic organic matter and inorganic clays nature are possible schwantes et al 2020 yue et al 2017 on the other hand extreme rainfall events are becoming more frequent with climate change which can also influence the fate of atrazine this observation justifies the need for studies evaluating atrazine dynamics under extreme conditions in south america phenomena such as la niña and el niño present more evident effects on agriculture practices and according to noaa the tendency is that their impacts will be intensified by climate change stein 2020 according to fernandes and grimm 2022 these phenomena are the primary source of interannual climate variation in south america and have been associated with extreme rainfall events floods and droughts in several regions of the continent wahiduzzaman et al 2022 fernandes and grimm 2022 climate change alters rainfall patterns mondal et al 2016 global temperature and atmospheric moisture mullan et al 2012 the addition of water vapor in the atmosphere influences climate circulation patterns modifying extreme rainfall events intensity frequency and incidence in tropical climate regions of brazil temperature and extreme rainfall events tend to be more frequent alves et al 2020 mondal et al 2016 hegerl et al 2004 these events could impact atrazine dissipation and increase surface and groundwater contamination therefore in this study we aimed to evaluate the mobility of atrazine in lysimeter cultivated with corn and the possibility of surface and groundwater contamination furthermore the work aims to respond to the following unsolved questions 1 the soil organic matter content is the foremost responsible for atrazine retention in a rhodic ferralsol furthermore 2 the distribution of atrazine in environmental matrices is affected by seasons summer and winter crops in south brazilian conditions 3 to what extent extreme tropical conditions such as high intensity rainfall and high temperatures can affect atrazine losses by runoff and leaching 4 high intensity rainfalls 24 and 48 h after spray could promote significant losses of atrazine by runoff or leaching compromising the water quality according to national and international standards and 5 to what extent the development stages of corn can influence the atrazine mobility thus seeking to solve such questions the present investigation aimed i to assess the role of soil organic matter in the retention of atrazine by a rhodic ferralsol in laboratory studies ii to evaluate the mobility of atrazine after successive spraying and intense rainfall simulations in corn grown in rhodic ferralsol iii to determine the possible influence that the seasons summer and winter crop have on the environmental dynamics of atrazine on field experiments and iv to determinate the possible relations between corn development on herbicide mobility in superficial runoff and leached water aiming to improve atrazine agronomic recommendations 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the field study was conducted using a leaching lysimeter marechal cândido rondon state of paraná south of brazil under the geographic coordinates latitude 24 558086 s longitude 54 045745 w and 471 m of altitude figure s1a and s1b environmental conditions of the studied period were obtained from a nearby weather automatic station figures s2 a composite sampling was performed to evaluate the granulometric and chemical characteristics of the soil this procedure was performed at depths of 0 20 and 20 40 cm the soil characterization was performed by determining total density and porosity teixeira et al 2017 2 2 lysimeter station the lysimeter was made of acrylic material 8 mm thick and with a 1 m² base containing an undisturbed soil sample of 1 m³ the sample is isolated laterally and at the bottom not allowing exchanges with the soil that gave rise to it in the downstream wall of the lysimeter close to the soil surface two holes are connected through flanges for runoff and leaching sampling in addition suction lysimeters were installed at different depths 20 30 40 50 and 60 cm outside the leaching lysimeter over the lysimeters a rain simulator was installed allowing precipitation intensity control 2 3 crop production the study area was cultivated with corn hybrid ns 50 pro the seeds were distributed at a depth of 3 5 cm adopting spacing between lines of 50 cm with three seeds sown per linear meter 65 000 plants ha 1 using the conventional sowing system hero zeta cypermethrin 20 w v 1 bifenthrin 18 w v 1 was sprayed at 200 l ha 1 to control spodoptera frugiperda and dichelops furcatus weed control was carried out according to necessity through manual weeding the corn crop and atrazine sprays were evaluated four times for two years from october 2018 to july 2020 encompassing four cropping seasons summer and winter therefore we will reference the crop s first and second years summer and winter seasons weather conditions precipitation and temperature are shown in figure s2 finally agricultural correctives and fertilizers were carried out through physical and chemical soil analysis and the estimates for maximum yield according to the manual of fertilization and liming for the state of paraná sbcs 2017 2 4 spraying and sampling after the corn emergence spraying of atrazine siptroil 40 w v 1 was carried out using 5 0 l ha 1 of the commercial product as recommended by the label the physicochemical characteristics of atrazine the essential criteria for pesticide classification and their final fate are shown in tables s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 and s6 weekly spraying of atrazine was carried out until the phenological stage v7 about 40 days after plants emergence dae coinciding with the critical period of weed interference cpwi of corn the period in which these invasive plants must be controlled to avoid productivity reduction i e the period in which the crop cannot suffer any weed interference figure s5 it also coincides with the most critical crop period concerning the attack of pests and consequent higher insecticide spraying at each crop summer and winter atrazine was sprayed six times in addition rainfall simulation at 24 and 48 h was conducted after each spray therefore four corn crops summer and winter in two years x 2 conditions of rainfall simulations 24 and 48 h after atrazine spray x 7 moments of sprays for each crop i e seven replicates in different phenological stages being only the last without atrazine spray i e 4 2x7 56 rainfall simulations in total more details of the experimental scheme are described in table 1 each rain simulation corresponded to high intensity rainfall events 150 mm h 1 whose frequency of occurrence is low nevertheless crucial in studies that evaluate the environmental dynamics of pesticides especially concerning south american conditions and predictions on climate change each rain simulation lasted 60 min being the runoff and leached samples collected at 5 min intervals these were stored in polyethylene bottles packed in thermal insulation boxes and transported to the laboratory for immediate analysis as described by queiroz et al 2011 and pinheiro et al 2013 the rainfall simulation tests were performed using a rain simulator similar to that described by meyer and harmon 1979 the simulator was installed 2 00 m above the ground and fed through a submerged pump with constant pressure the water used in the rain simulation came from a drinking water source near the stimulation site a spray nozzle of the type veejet 80 100 was used to simulate rainfall with characteristics similar to natural rainfall generating 150 mm h 1 the pressure used during the simulations was monitored and controlled using a manometer in addition a calibration was performed before every rainfall simulation for that purpose a rainfall intensity calibration was performed using a 1 21 m2 zinc box with 0 10 m height the flow rate obtained for runoff and leaching water from rainfall simulations is shown in figures s7a and s7b the leaching potential of atrazine to groundwater was carried out using the gus groundwater ubiquity score index gustafson 1989 to compare the field results with theoretical indexes the goss method was used goss 1992 to evaluate the transport potential of atrazine associated with sediments or dissolved in water for surface or groundwater 2 5 laboratory analysis 2 5 1 soil characterization the soil samples were characterized by physicochemical analysis at the laboratory of environmental and instrumental chemistry belonging to the study group on soil and environment the granulometric analysis of soil samples for textural classification was performed using the pipette method described by claessen 1997 the soil fertility attributes were evaluated according to the methods described by the soil chemical analysis manual and their recommendations for the state of paraná pavan et al 1992 finally the soil density was obtained using the volumetric cylinder method teixeira et al 2017 2 5 2 atrazine sorption capacity in rhodic ferralsol a laboratory study 2 5 2 1 experimental design the adsorption of pesticides in soils can be explained to a certain extent by their relationship with the soil organic matter therefore the role of soil organic matter in the retention of atrazine in rhodic ferralsol was assessed in laboratory studies by two treatments 1 rhodic ferralsol samples in their natural form i e with an organic matter content of 17 09 g dm 3 and 2 calcined rhodic ferralsol samples i e without organic matter for that purpose soil samples were dried in an oven with forced air circulation at 105 ºc for 48 h and the particles were standardized 2 0 mm after that a subsample of 500 g of rhodic ferralsol was taken and heated at 500 ºc for 5 h in a muffle furnace nova técnica nt 380 1200 ºc using porcelain capsules to obtain soil without organic matter nguyen et al 2022 2 5 2 2 adsorption studies equilibrium and thermodynamics in erlenmeyer flasks of 125 ml 10 0 g of soil from each treatment calcined and with natural organic matter content were weighted and set in contact with 50 ml of atrazine solution with 0 2 5 10 15 20 and 25 mg l 1 of atrazine pestanal sigma aldrich lot bcbr7544v then the erlenmeyer flasks were stirred for two hours in a dubnoff shaker yu et al 2020 at 5 30 and 35 ºc subsequently samples were centrifuged filtered and liquid liquid extraction was performed using the proportion 1 10 1 5 ml of tertiary butyl methyl ether mtbe to 15 ml of sampled water 3 nacl salting out effect and stirred on a vibrax shaker vxr ika at 1000 rpm for two hours after that following the methodology proposed by the united states environmental protection agency epa 8141 usepa 2007 figures s3a s3b s4a and s4b samples were taken to gc ecd to determine the remaining atrazine concentration ct or ce and to estimate the adsorbed amount qt or qe eq 1 the obtained data were analyzed using the nonlinear empirical models of langmuir and freundlich langmuir 1918 freundlich 1906 eqs 2 and 3 figure s6 1 in addition the thermodynamic parameters gº hº and sº were obtained by analyzing the isotherms in different

wilk normality test and bartlett homogeneity test through the sisvar ferreira 2014 in addition statistica version 7 0 statsoft was used to construct response surface graphs of atrazine environmental dynamics as the data did not show normality a descriptive analysis was performed with response surface graphs 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil characterization table 2 shows some characteristics of the studied rhodic ferralsol in the 0 20 cm layer the soil has a clayey texture ph of 5 77 and average organic matter content a high percentage of clay mainly iron oxides such as hematite is found in the 20 40 cm layer which characterizes the soil with a clay texture in addition the soil has a high ph and low organic matter content sbcs 2017 the results obtained in its layers are similar regarding physical and chemical attributes as a rhodic ferralsol it is deep with very homogeneous characteristics and profile especially its textural parameters santos et al 2013 according to table 2 3 2 atrazine sorption capacity in rhodic ferralsol a laboratory study table 3 exhibits the adsorption of atrazine in rhodic ferralsol adjusted by the models of langmuir and freundlich it is essential to state that the atrazine adsorption data could not be adjusted by langmuir nonlinear model at 15 ºc and 25 ºc while the goodness of fit obtained for the freundlich model allowed it estimates of all adsorption parameters in the evaluated temperature range the mean absorption coefficients obtained at 25 ºc were kd 2 59 l kg 1 and koc 281 64 l kg 1 which are close to the values obtained by lopes et al 2011 and schmidt et al 2015 with koc varying from 37 a 104 l kg 1 the interactions between factors such as rainfall temperature variations especially from summer to winter the biological activity of the soil the crop management no tillage can play a significant influence on the soil organic matter and therefore influence the koc values justifying the variation found on table 3 kookana et al 2010 oliver et al 2003 also reported that in 43 west australian surface soil samples the koc values ranged from 36 to 910 for atrazine these variations can occur due to the differences in organic matter characteristics humic substance types and their content environment temperature between summer and winter and other edaphoclimatic properties according to fig 1 the adsorption maximum capacity predicted by langmuir qlangmuir decreases with the increase in temperature 15 ºc 0 069 30 ºc 0 045 and 35 ºc 0 032 mg g 1 kfreundlich values present the same tendency 15 ºc 0 080 20 ºc 0 053 25 ºc 0 036 30 ºc 0 042 and 35 ºc 0 025 mg g 1 this behavior indicates that atrazine molecules desorb from the soil colloid interface due to increased temperature and randomness yu et al 2020 also observed a decrease in qlangmuir and kfreundlich due to temperature rise yu et al 2020 found kfreundlich values inferior to 5 mg g 1 mg l 1 1 n which according to the authors indicates that atrazine has a weak soil sorption capacity similarly kfreundlich values were inferior to the unity atrazine could present high mobility in the soil water environment with possible leaching to deeper soil layers with consequent contamination of groundwater according to the goodness of the fit obtained for freundlich figures s7a and s7b and table 3 atrazine adsorption occurs in a multilayer moreover the decrease in the adsorption rates due to the temperature increase indicates an exothermic process according to δhº values 0 the low entropy values δsº 48 215 kj mol 1 suggest a reversible adsorption process while δgº values 0 suggest a spontaneous adsorption process the following nfreundlich values were found in each temperature range 2 96 15 ºc 5 46 20 ºc 4 47 25 ºc 4 23 30 ºc 7 89 35 ºc i e between 1 and 10 which indicates favorable adsorption of atrazine by the rhodic ferralsol colloids moreover 1 n values were distant and inferior to one 0 33 at 15 ºc 0 18 at 20 ºc 0 22 at 25 ºc 0 23 at 30 ºc and 0 12 at 35 ºc indicating that atrazine adsorption is not linear i e the energy is not the same for every adsorption site similar results are reported by yue et al 2017 in three different chinese soils laterite paddy and alluvial soils the authors mentioned above show atrazine adsorption by soil particles with 1 n values varying from 0 58 to 0 88 according to the goodness of the fit obtained for freundlich atrazine adsorption occurs in a multilayer moreover the low entropy values δsº 48 215 kj mol 1 suggest a reversible adsorption process while δgº values 0 suggest a spontaneous adsorption process yu et al 2020 found similar results studying two chinese soils from wanzhou and wushan according to the authors the atrazine sorption is spontaneous δgº varying from 0 849 to 0 222 kj mol k 1 and exothermic δhº varying from 5 38 to 9 27 kj mol 1 in contrast yue et al 2017 found atrazine adsorption in laterite paddy and alluvial soils with positive δhº values varying from 22 34 to 42 44 kj mol 1 and with decreasing values of δgº varying from 1 15 to 3 31 kj mol 1 according to the authors δgº decreased with the increasing temperature agreeing with the assumption of an endothermic adsorption process which leads to atrazine sorption onto the soil surface more favorably in higher temperatures these results show us that the behavior of polar pesticides such as atrazine can vary depending on edaphoclimatic conditions therefore it is crucial to continue to study such issues for a deeper understanding of the interactions between soil particles and xenobiotics for the calcined soil samples i e with no soil organic matter som it was impossible to construct any isotherm langmuir or freundlich in the function of imperfect correlations and to the meager obtained adsorption rates figures s7 1 and s7 2 this result may strongly indicate that the interactions between atrazine and organic matter in soil may significantly affect this pesticide retention as observed in figure 8 the som plays a significant role in the atrazine adsorption in the studied rhodic ferralsol with a mean 20 3 higher retention of atrazine in the samples with a natural organic matter content 17 09 g dm 3 figure s8 nevertheless calcinated soil samples also presented a significant adsorption percentage which indicates that 53 of clay mainly iron oxides such as hematite usually in great quantities in rhodic ferralsol can play a significant role in atrazine retention 3 3 transport of atrazine on corn grown during the season summer of 1st and 2nd year the destination and transport of pesticides in soils are subject to complex interactions between many physical chemical and biological processes steffens et al 2013 figure s6 illustrates the corn growth stage during the spray of atrazine while figs 2 and 3 and table s7 show the concentrations of atrazine from runoff and leached samples during rain simulations in summer and winter corn crops in two years of evaluation as observed in the season crop summer atrazine residues in runoff and leaching were detected 24 and 48 h after herbicide applications while for off season crops winter atrazine was not transported in the same proportion the atrazine concentrations in runoff 24 h and 48 h observed in fig 2 are associated with the higher empty space between plants during the first stages of the corn plants i e in those corn growth stages the gaps between rows could significative increase runoff by soil erosion also in advanced corn growth stages atrazine concentrations decrease substantially most likely due to the increase of biomass on the surface which protects the soil from runoff the leachate samples 24 h and 48 h demonstrate no uniformity in atrazine concentrations during the sampling periods 5 50 min of rainfall simulation moreover it is worth noting that even with the development of corn plants high concentrations of atrazine were found in percolate samples table s7 summarizes the pesticide concentrations found in summer in samples of runoff and leaching during the rainfall simulations applied 24 and 48 h after atrazine spray atrazine detection reached 100 of the evaluated samples during the first year while in the 2nd year the detection frequency was on average only 1 during the first year of study the highest concentration of atrazine was found in runoff 24 h after the pesticide application the value obtained is approximately 5649 µg l 1 around 2824 times higher than the maximum allowed value vmp by consolidation ordinance no 5 of 28 september 2017 from the ministry of health which is 2 0 µg l 1 brasil 2017 with the same value established by conama in resolution nº 357 brasil 2005 for water bodies the detected value is also higher than the maximum limits established for detecting atrazine in drinking water of 3 0 µg l 1 in the usa and 0 1 µg l 1 in the european union european comission 1998 bethsass and colangelo 2006 usepa 2020 it is worth mentioning that the physical and chemical properties of the molecule play a fundamental role in the dynamics of the pesticide on the environment for example although atrazine has a molecular weight of 215 68 g mol 1 low medium solubility in water at 20ºc 35 mg l 1 log koc 100 this herbicide is a very weak base due to its low dissociation constant pka 1 7 and log kow of 2 75 baranowska et al 2008 iupac 2018 which favor its runoff and leaching in certain soil conditions the atrazine found on the surface and groundwater may be more related to its kow 2 75 and logkoc observed among 3 63 3 10 suggesting a high leaching potential carmo et al 2013 furthermore koc estimates the tendency of pesticide partition in the liquid phase for organic matter in the soil pedroso and neto 2018 thus indicating the herbicide s affinity with soil organic carbon oliveira and brighenti 2011 as already evidenced in our results section 3 3 both parameters kow and logkoc are relevant since the sorption values are directly related to the retention of the molecule in the soil which makes it possible to infer its final fate oliveira and brighenti 2011 it is worth mentioning that the interaction of atrazine with soil particles also depends on its solubility in water and the sediment s characteristics such as the amount of organic matter clay and ph dellamatrice and monteiro 2014 for example the studied rhodic ferralsols have high clay and organic matter table 2 nevertheless with atrazine s low medium solubility low kow and low koc little interaction between atrazine and soil colloids is observed see previous results in section 3 3 thus atrazine fate by leaching and runoff is favored with the highest atrazine amount found 24 h after the herbicide spraying table s7 according to a study conducted by dores et al 2008 triazines have great potential for contamination of ground and surface water due to their low medium solubility persistence in the environment and low adsorption to the soil schmidt et al 2015 evaluated the sorption and desorption of thiamethoxam and atrazine under different management systems using a dystrophic rhodic ferralsol of clayey texture with low som content their results show that the soil presented low retention of atrazine with little influence of som and soil management on atrazine soil retention facilitating the transport of atrazine by leaching and runoff lima et al 2020 while evaluating the effects of liming and phosphate fertilizer on the adsorption and mobility of atrazine also found more significant atrazine transportation by leaching and runoff processes a higher atrazine concentration was found in runoff samples in the first days after spraying in the abovementioned study however in leaching samples the presence of atrazine was detected in a lower proportion than in runoff samples the occurrence of lower losses by leaching may be related to more significant atrazine losses through surface runoff mendes et al 2019 found similar results when evaluating the transport of atrazine in agricultural soil of clay texture in laboratory conditions according to the authors atrazine was not detected in leached water below 30 cm however atrazine presence was found in the 0 10 cm soil layer suggesting little vertical mobility but a greater risk of transport via runoff it is worth mentioning that during the 2nd year atrazine was detected only in runoff samples 24 h after spraying in the other simulation events atrazine was not detected in runoff or leaching samples this reduction on atrazine during the sampling periods 5 60 min and dae may be associated with the closing of space between plants during corn development figure s6 which reduces exposed soil area to pesticide spraying and also reduces the intensity of raindrops on the soil surface for runoff after 48 h and leaching samples 24 and 48 h after spraying the absence of the atrazine in the analyzed samples is verified lower natural rainfall was observed 130 mm during the 2nd year of the summer crop which could theoretically cause a lower presence of atrazine in the soil solution and therefore the rainfall simulations could not be sufficient to cause significant leaching the maximum atrazine found was 5097 µg l 1 in runoff 24 h after application this result corroborates with the first study in which the maximum concentration of atrazine is 5647 µg l 1 it is important to note that as previously mentioned atrazine usually adheres to the first layers of the soil 0 30 cm by affinity with organic matter on the surface the highest concentrations are mainly detected in runoff 24 h after spraying and not after 48 h since atrazine is retained by the mineral and organic fraction of the soil in the top layers of the soil profile and then carried by runoff and erosion processes these values are mainly detected in the initial samples first sampling periods and during the first days after corn emergence suggesting a cumulative effect from the previous study however it should be noted that despite the little interaction between atrazine and the soil the pesticide is partially retained mainly by iron oxides and som furthermore according to other studies atrazine has little vertical mobility in the soil usually detected in soil samples between 0 30 cm which favors its degradation by microorganisms paula et al 2016 salazar ledesma et al 2018 mendes et al 2019 according to udiković kolić et al 2012 biological degradation is considered the major transformation route of atrazine therefore the repeated spraying of atrazine in the same place can promote the selection of microorganisms that can use these molecules as a growth substrate resulting in a significant increase in its degradation rhine et al 2003 udiković kolić et al 2011 singh and singh 2016 this phenomenon corroborates the observed data since in the second year summer crop a reduction in the atrazine detection was found compared to the first study suggesting the selectivity of microorganisms after successive spraying of pesticide and atrazine biodegradation fungi bacteria actinomycetes and other microorganisms use pesticides in their metabolic processes like carbon and energy sources nawaz et al 2010 some atrazine degrading bacteria are well known one of them is pseudomonas sp adp strain can decompose atrazine and transform it into nh3 and co2 through the action of enzymes siripattanakul et al 2009 udiković kolić et al 2012 these organisms are widespread in the soil cultivated with different vegetal species in brazilian states braz et al 2018 another well characterized strain whose metabolic pathway is different from pseudomonas sp adp strain is arthrobacter aurescens tc 1 which can metabolize atrazine to cyanuric acid through a degrading pathway that occurs through enzymes udiković kolić et al 2012 fernandes et al 2020 conducted a study in a brazilian rhodic ferralsol to verify the influence of the spraying of atrazine on the soil microbial community they report the microbiota s ability to quickly adapt to atrazine after initial exposure by increasing atrazine biodegradation genes these could explain our findings as atrazine was never used in this experimental land before our evaluations therefore microbiota adaptation could explain why the atrazine loss by runoff and leaching is higher in the first summer crop hang et al 2010 carried out studies with lysimeters in two types of argentine soil to assess the mobility of atrazine and the possibility of contamination of aquifers by the above authors the transport of atrazine decreases thought time after its spraying and the highest atrazine concentration in percolating water was detected in the first 30 days after spraying the pesticide therefore the critical period related to the possible groundwater and surface contamination may be associated with precipitation events close to the moment of atrazine spraying and in the first days after corn emergence as highlighted by our findings fig 2 and table s7 3 4 transport of atrazine on corn grown during the offseason winter of 1st and 2nd year fig 3 and table s7 illustrate the concentrations of atrazine obtained in runoff and leached samples during rain simulations on corn cultivated during winter 1st and 2nd year atrazine was only detected in runoff samples 24 h after spraying no atrazine was detected in runoff samples after 48 h of spraying also atrazine was not found in leaching samples after 24 or 48 h after spraying being this behavior is observed in the 1st and 2nd winter crops numerous factors could explain this behavior firstly lower temperatures down to 2 4 ºc were observed during the evaluated period which could affect water viscosity and therefore cause a reduction in the leaching of atrazine secondly as these results were obtained from a succession of corn crops from the summer season the soil microbiota is probably adapted to this type of pesticide therefore biodegradation of atrazine could partially explain the lower runoff and leaching of the pesticide the higher atrazine levels were found in runoff samples 24 h after spray during the initial sampling periods from 1 to 8 and 38 43 dae the value obtained is approximately 422 µg l 1 about 211x higher than the maximum allowed value vmp by consolidation ordinance no 5 of 28 september 2017 from the ministry of health which is 2 0 µg l 1 brasil 2017 with the same value established by conama brasil 2005 furthermore the detected values are higher than the maximum limits established for detecting atrazine in drinking water of 3 0 µg l 1 in the usa and the european union 0 1 µg l 1 european comission 1998 bethsass and colangelo 2006 usepa 2020 however it is noteworthy that the detection frequency was only 3 with most samples showing values below the limit of quantification 1 5 µg l 1 nevertheless it is essential to consider that some amount of atrazine might have been transported through runoff or leaching in concentrations below the detection limit as the maximum value detected was 1054 µg l 1 i e 527x higher than the vmp by the brazilian ministry of health brasil 2017 conama brasil 2005 for both the maximum acceptable values is 2 0 µg l 1 and higher than permitted values for drinking water in the usa 3 0 µg l 1 usepa 2020 however it is noteworthy that the mean frequency of detections was only 3 with most samples showing values below loq 1 497 µg l 1 moreover the smaller number of detections and reduced concentrations of atrazine found in runoff and leaching samples from the winter corn season may be related to favorable climatic conditions for biological degradation performance such as temperature and rainfall in addition as reported in the bibliography the possibility of selecting microorganisms and increasing the degradation capacity due to successive spraying of the pesticide in the study area rhine et al 2003 udiković kolić et al 2011 singh and singh 2016 in general a higher frequency of detections and concentrations of atrazine were found in runoff volumes in a study by almagro et al 2017 the potential impacts of climate change on rainfall erosivity in brazil were evaluated using baseline data 1961 2005 and projected precipitation data 2007 2099 according to the results there is a possible increase in rainfall erosivity in the south region of brazil it may affect a significant portion of brazil s agricultural production due to increased soil loss rates and decreased soil fertility and water availability in addition water contamination may increase as a result since the most significant load of atrazine is transported by runoff 3 5 atrazine detection by the suction lysimeters suction lysimeters were installed at 20 30 40 50 and 60 cm depths none of the studies detected atrazine in the water volumes sampled at these depths this absence of atrazine detection may be related to the physicochemical interactions of its molecule with soil colloids mineral and organic matter and the limitation of the detection method it is important to note that this result corroborates what was previously mentioned since atrazine is mainly transported by runoff or is quickly leached in depth 1 m other authors have already reported this behavior in similar experimental conditions salazar ledesma et al 2018 mendes et al 2019 3 6 possibility of leaching and runoff of atrazine residues at the end of corn crops the persistence of pesticides in the environment is related to how these substances remain in various matrices and environmental compartments therefore any substance resulting from its spraying including metabolites and the molecule itself are considered pesticide residues oliveira and regitano 2009 at the end of the crop cycle a rain simulation was carried out 80 days after the last spraying to evaluate the possible transportation of atrazine residues and the possibility of contamination of surface and underground waters the obtained atrazine concentrations in runoff and leaching samples 80 days after the last spray in both studies 1st and 2nd years of evaluation showed no detection of atrazine at 120 dae and 80 days after the last spraying with values below the limit of quantification 1 497 µg l 1 this result is expected since the half life of atrazine is approximately 75 days however it is worth mentioning that some atrazine was transported by runoff leaching and a significant part was probably partly absorbed by corn plants biodegraded by the soil microbiota or retained by soil colloids similar behavior is reported by salazar ledesma et al 2018 who detected atrazine in leaching water up to two months after its spraying paula et al 2016 found a significant reduction in atrazine concentration in leached water according to the time after spraying moreover atrazine was detected up to 40 days after the spraying of the commercial product no longer being detected after hang et al 2010 observed that the highest atrazine concentration was leached up to 30 days after spraying according to paula et al 2016 when evaluating the leaching and persistence of atrazine in a red yellow rhodic ferralsol atrazine presents a potential groundwater risk of contamination first however it is crucial to consider this molecule has low persistence 3 7 environmental distribution of atrazine guss and goss indexes estimates guss and goss indexes are essential tools to estimate the potential for pesticide transport by leaching and runoff the guss index can help rank high mobility pesticides and classify their groundwater contamination risk at the same time the goss model indicates the risk of transportation of pesticides by runoff i e their transportation via water and sediments which can help rank molecules with high surface mobility and their risk regarding surface water contamination the results obtained in this study corroborate the trend estimated by the guss index and goss models table s1 in a simplified way when analyzing the analytical results of the four conducted crops it is noted that the presence of atrazine was detected in both runoff and percolate flow especially in intense precipitation shortly after spraying the herbicide a more significant number of detections can be observed in the runoff demonstrating that the molecule can be easily transported in water or moderately transported when associated with sediments as predicted by the goss model nevertheless analyzing the data obtained during four crops 2 summer and 2 winter seasons it is observed that 13 1 of atrazine is retained in the soil 4 7 is transported by runoff and 1 3 is leached below 1 m depth fig 4d shows that 81 0 of atrazine was probably absorbed by plants corn and weeds then metabolized biodegraded by soil microorganisms and suffered photodegradation xiaozhen et al 2005 hydrolysis or other non evaluated pathways nevertheless considering the high intense rainfall i e extreme weather simulated conditions the 13 1 and the 4 7 of atrazine transported by runoff and leaching can cause severe surface and groundwater contamination moreover most of the detections are higher than national and international standards fig 4a shows that soil retention is 2 2x higher during winter crops these estimates considered the maximum adsorption capacity obtained by kfreundlich at 15 ºc and 25 ºc section 3 3 moreover runoff and leaching are facilitated during summer crops probably due to high temperatures higher water viscosity and more rainy weather among other factors the mean values of atrazine transported by runoff are about 14x higher if there is a rain of 150 mm h 1 within 24 h of the spray fig 4b while the leaching of atrazine is 1 7x higher in 48 h compared to 24 h after spray another important observation is that during the 2nd year of evaluation other non evaluated pathways such as atrazine in the soil profile and still in motion plant absorption biodegradation and volatilization among others had a substantial increase 8 6 probably due to the change in soil microbiota which enhanced the biodegradation of atrazine 4 conclusion the obtained results reveal kd mean at 25 c 11 68 l kg 1 koc mean at 25 c 1266 07 l kg 1 and kfreundlich mean at 25 ºc 0 036 mg g 1 mg l 1 1 n adsorption coefficients close to previous reports from literature for atrazine retention by rhodic ferralsol and other soil classes moreover the atrazine sorption capacity decreases with temperature suggesting an exothermic process δhº values 0 the low entropy values suggest a reversible adsorption process δsº 48 215 kj mol 1 while the δgº values 0 suggest a spontaneous process the results obtained using freundlich isotherm suggests multilayer atrazine adsorption by rhodic ferralsol enhanced by the soil organic matter by 20 3 in the evaluated conditions in winter atrazine adsorption by soil increases by 2 2x while atrazine loss by runoff and leaching decreases by 6 75 and 3 0x the losses of atrazine by runoff during rainfall simulation 150 mm h 1 are 14 5x greater after 24 h spray than 48 h while atrazine lost by leaching is 1 7x greater 48 h than 24 h after spray the atrazine concentrations in runoff can be associated with space between plants during the first stages of the corn crop the runoff or leached water contained atrazine levels much higher than national or international standards for drinking water natural waters or effluent discharge our results highlight the importance of implementing soil conservation techniques such as the no till system and the great concern that weather forecasts should have in the plan of pesticide spray in the extreme weather conditions evaluated in our experiment atrazine application on corn crops can increase the

southeastern usa due to high growth rates and low input requirements sycamore is regarded as a promising second generation bioenergy woody crop suitable for degraded or marginal lands however little is known about sycamore water use for the conditions of north carolina nc especially during the establishment year when trees are most sensitive to soil water deficits we evaluated energy fluxes and actual crop evapotranspiration etc act rates of sycamore src during the establishment year on marginal land in the piedmont physiographic region of nc our overall goal was to better understand the

increased with precipitation and with tree development reaching a maximum of 5 7 mm d 1 although severe water stress was not observed during the study period a moderate drought occurred from mid

content in the upper 5 cm of soil was about 0 10 m3 m 3 indicating that the sycamore field relied on water available within the upper soil layers measurements suggested that trees may not yet have

emissions on the earth s climate system have led to global efforts to reduce dependency of the energy sector on fossil fuels in the usa the energy and independence security act of 2007 eisa aimed to incentivize biofuel production by setting a target of 36 billion gallons of biofuel by 2022 of which 21 billion gallons should be obtained from cellulosic or sources other than cornstarch public law 2007 bioenergy sources are classified as first or second generation ho et al 2014 first generation bioenergy sources are converted into ethanol by fermentation of sugar and starches which are commonly derived from crops such as sugarcane saccharum spp and corn zea mays l whereas second generation sources consist of cellulosic biomass from woody perennials such as poplar populus spp and willow salix spp solomon et al 2007 because land must be allocated for the production of biofuels at present there are environmental concerns related to the displacement of agricultural fields to land units

dallemand 2019 it is estimated that vegetation clearing resulting from biofuel production could offset any carbon sequestration benefits from bioenergy crops and even create a biofuel carbon debt fargione et al 2008 fritsche et al 2010 in order to minimize these issues bioenergy crops have been targeted for marginal lands which can be defined as land units not suitable for commodity crop

the strategic plan of the state of north carolina nc seeks to ensure that 10 of liquid fuels sold in the state come from biofuels grown within nc burke et al 2007 it is estimated that there are more than 1 million hectares of marginal land distributed across the main physiographic regions of nc that could support bioenergy crops costanza et al 2016 in particular the piedmont region has been regarded as a candidate location of second generation bioenergy crops due to the moderately eroded soils susceptibility to episodic drought and lack of irrigation stephenson et al 2021 since soil water deficits are likely to occur during the growing season in this region and climate change predictions forecast increased likelihood of drought in the southeastern usa king et al 2013 it is imperative that bioenergy crops selected for this region are well adapted to stressful environmental conditions in this context american sycamore platanus occidentalis l a hardwood species native of the southeastern usa shows promise as a low maintenance bioenergy crop for landowners seeking to diversify their operations research in the piedmont region of nc shows that sycamore can tolerate biotic and abiotic stress and produce substantial amounts of dry biomass with little to no inputs e g irrigation fertilizers herbicides etc this may represent a significant advantage over other bioenergy woody crop candidates such poplar willow and sweetgum that are known to require high inputs domec et al 2017 ile et al 2021a domec et al 2017 reported that depending on planting density sycamore src yielded 8 23 mg ha 1 of dry biomass after a 4 year rotation equating up to 2400 l ha 1 year 1 of ethanol an additional attractive feature of short rotation woody crops such as sycamore is the opportunity to supply the demand of local wood pellet industries which comprise an important economic sector of the southeastern usa that attend both domestic and international markets ile 2021a

seasonal variation in energy balance components and their ratios are shown in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively monthly means of energy balance component ratios are shown in table 2 the gaps in fig 5 were due to large rainfall events that caused daily g to change sign in those instances the ratios between energy balance components were not calculated because g measurements may be unreliable due to

even though rs was similar on both days rn was lower on doy 248 compared to doy 235 16 6 vs 14 3 mj m 2 d 1 that may be attributed to increased emission of longwave radiation from the surface bonan

decreased by 30 from doy 235 248 13 1 vs 9 4 mj m 2 d 1 which corresponds to an increase in β from 0 1 to 0 4 and a reduction in etc act from 5 4 to 3 8 mm d 1 fig 6 this reduction in le suggests that water use by the sycamore field is highly sensitive to the amount of water in the upper soil layers accordingly our results indicate that during the establishment year the sycamore field may transition from an energy limited to a water limited evapotranspiration regime before θ reaches θpwp seneviratne et al 2010 our data show that for the environmental conditions and soil type at our study site this transition may occur at critical θ θcrit close to 0 10 m3 m 3 fig 7 these results support our hypotheses that water use would increase with stand development during the establishment year and that trees are sensitive to dry spells since their root systems may not yet allow water uptake from deeper soil layers to support transpiration during a drying cycle 3 3 evapotranspiration and water use daily variation of etc act and its cumulative value for the sycamore field in 2021 are shown in fig 8 monthly total etc act and mean daily etc act and kc act are shown in table 1 etc act patterns were influenced by rainfall distribution and tree development as discussed previously average monthly etc act was highly correlated with estimated lai fig 9 during the early part of the growing season actual crop coefficients were low 0 6 and increased to a maximum during august september when an average kc act of 0 9 was obtained as the trees started to senesce both etc act and kc act decreased under these conditions etc act may be considered mostly direct soil water evaporation average kc act across the 2021 growing season was 0 7 due to the high correlation between lai and etc act fig 9 we would expect that sycamore kc act would increase in following years with greater tree canopy development a cursory search of the literature was unable to locate kc act values for sycamore grown in other regions of the usa the kc act values we observed in our study were lower than what was found for other bioenergy crops in the piedmont region of nc stephenson et al 2021 reported that average kc act for mature stands of switchgrass miscanthus fescue corn and sorghum were 0 93 0 97 1 13 1 12 and 1 27 respectively reports in the literature of kc act values for other woody bioenergy species such as poplar and willow for the conditions of nc are lacking however information can be found for such species under different environmental conditions in canada china and european countries fischer et al 2013 using bowen ratio measurements lindroth et al 1994 found that an irrigated stand of willow had a kc act of 1 08 in sweden for mediterranean climatic conditions in italy lysimeter measurements by guidi et al 2008 showed that willow and poplar had high kc act values during first year growth ranging from 1 28 to 2 84 and 1 06 1 90 respectively under extreme arid conditions in china bowen ratio measurements by hou et al 2010 showed that poplar had a maximum kc act of 0 62 by means of eddy flux measurements cai et al 2011 found that on marginal land in central alberta canada poplar had a kc act of 0 43 lastly fischer et al 2018 reported that poplar had a mean annual kc act of 0 82 which ranged from 0 65 to 0 95 across different locations in europe it should be noted that these kc act values are representative of woody species at specific growth stages and environmental conditions where they were obtained and are given here for context rather than direct comparison with the values of our study total etc act for the sycamore field was 482 mm during the establishment phase of the first year after planting fig 8c which represents a surplus of water of 27 mm and rainfall use efficiency of 0 95 i e cumulative etc act divided by cumulative rainfall this suggests that during the establishment year water use by the sycamore field was highly coupled to rainfall we would expect cumulative etc act to increase with tree development greater lai and root system and hypothesize that a mature stand of sycamore may have cumulative etc act values that exceed cumulative rainfall information on sycamore water use for other regions of the usa is currently lacking during the establishment year sycamore used less water than reported for annual bioenergy grasses e g corn and sorghum and mature stands of perennial species e g switchgrass miscanthus and fescue stephenson et al 2021 reported that in the piedmont region of nc cumulative etc act for switchgrass miscanthus fescue corn and sorghum were 847 883 1029 596 and 691 mm respectively higher water use by corn and sorghum is explained by the fact that these crops are fertilized and have high growth rates whereas the perennial species have a longer growing season reports in the literature on water use of other woody bioenergy species in nc are lacking cumulative etc act for different woody bioenergy crops grown in other countries are summarized in table 3 comparison with literature reports show that cumulative etc act of the sycamore field during the establishment year is within values found for other species grown under different environmental conditions research is needed to evaluate and compare the water use of different woody bioenergy species e g sycamore willow poplar etc under the conditions of nc 4 summary and conclusion energy fluxes and etc act rates were examined in an establishing sycamore bioenergy src cropping system on marginal land in the piedmont region of nc focusing on responses to rainfall distribution and soil water deficits as trees developed we found that etc act of the sycamore field was closely coupled to contemporaneous rainfall and 95 of the precipitation incident on the field was returned as etc act leaving a surplus of 27 mm at the end of the year although severe drought was not observed during our study a rapid reduction in etc act was observed after the onset of a drying cycle suggesting sycamore may avoid drought stress by rapidly decreasing physiological activity e g gas exchange as a survival mechanism during this most vulnerable stage of stand development after 13 days of drying etc act rates decreased by 30 and the water use regime of the sycamore field transitioned from an energy limited to water limited at a surface soil water content threshold of about 0 10 m3 m 3 our results indicate that during the establishment year the young sycamore trees were strongly dependent on available soil water at shallow depths due to the limited development of roots systems and therefore lack of access to deep soil water the fact that the establishing trees survived this period of low water availability while competing with intense herbaceous competition suggests sycamore has significant physiological capacity to withstand environmental stress biotic and abiotic making it highly suitable as a bioenergy crop species king et al 2013 continuing studies at our site are being conducted to evaluate water use over the full src cycle 3 4 years in order to assess the water footprint associated with biomass

southeastern usa due to high growth rates and low input requirements sycamore is regarded as a promising second generation bioenergy woody crop suitable for degraded or marginal lands however little is known about sycamore water use for the conditions of north carolina nc especially during the establishment year when trees are most sensitive to soil water deficits we evaluated energy fluxes and actual crop evapotranspiration etc act rates of sycamore src during the establishment year on marginal land in the piedmont physiographic region of nc our overall goal was to better understand the factors controlling the evaporative demand of sycamore and its sensitivity to drought stress during establishment total etc act was 482 mm which was 95 of the total rainfall at the site etc act rates increased with precipitation and with tree development reaching a maximum of 5 7 mm d 1 although severe water stress was not observed during the study period a moderate drought occurred from mid august to mid september during which a 13 day drying cycle caused etc act rates to decrease by 30 the sycamore src transitioned from an energy limited to a water limited etc act regime when water content in the upper 5 cm of soil was about 0 10 m3 m 3 indicating that the sycamore field relied on water available within the upper soil layers measurements suggested that trees may not yet have

emissions on the earth s climate system have led to global efforts to reduce dependency of the energy sector on fossil fuels in the usa the energy and independence security act of 2007 eisa aimed to incentivize biofuel production by setting a target of 36 billion gallons of biofuel by 2022 of which 21 billion gallons should be obtained from cellulosic or sources other than cornstarch public law 2007 bioenergy sources are classified as first or second generation ho et al 2014 first generation bioenergy sources are converted into ethanol by fermentation of sugar and starches which are commonly derived from crops such as sugarcane saccharum spp and corn zea mays l whereas second generation sources consist of cellulosic biomass from woody perennials such as poplar populus spp and willow salix spp solomon et al 2007 because land must be allocated for the production of biofuels at present there are environmental concerns related to the displacement of agricultural fields to land units traditionally not used for commodity crop production e g forests wetlands savannas grasslands peatlands etc a process commonly referred to as indirect land use change ale et al 2019 scarlat and dallemand 2019 it is estimated that vegetation clearing resulting from biofuel production could offset any carbon sequestration benefits from bioenergy crops and even create a biofuel carbon debt fargione et al 2008 fritsche et al 2010 in order to minimize these issues bioenergy crops have been targeted for marginal lands which can be defined as land units not suitable for commodity crop production due to undesirable soil factors e g susceptibility to drought or flooding erosion exchangeable acidity low nutrient availability etc and low realistic yield expectations crozier et al 2021 the strategic plan of the state of north carolina nc seeks to ensure that 10 of liquid fuels sold in the state come from biofuels grown within nc burke et al 2007 it is estimated that there are more than 1 million hectares of marginal land distributed across the main physiographic regions of nc that could support bioenergy crops costanza et al 2016 in particular the piedmont region has been regarded as a candidate location of second generation bioenergy crops due to the moderately eroded soils susceptibility to episodic drought and lack of irrigation stephenson et al 2021 since soil water deficits are likely to occur during the growing season in this region and climate change predictions forecast increased likelihood of drought in the southeastern usa king et al 2013 it is imperative that bioenergy crops selected for this region are well adapted to stressful environmental conditions in this context american sycamore platanus occidentalis l a hardwood species native of the southeastern usa shows promise as a low maintenance bioenergy crop for landowners seeking to diversify their operations research in the piedmont region of nc shows that sycamore can tolerate biotic and abiotic stress and produce substantial amounts of dry biomass with little to no inputs e g irrigation fertilizers herbicides etc this may represent a significant advantage over other bioenergy woody crop candidates such poplar willow and sweetgum that are known to require high inputs domec et al 2017 ile et al 2021a domec et al 2017 reported that depending on planting density sycamore src yielded 8 23 mg ha 1 of dry biomass after a 4 year rotation equating up to 2400 l ha 1 year 1 of ethanol an additional attractive feature of short rotation woody crops such as sycamore is the opportunity to supply the demand of local wood pellet industries which comprise an important economic sector of the southeastern usa that attend both domestic and international markets ile 2021a

energy balances of sycamore src are lacking especially on marginal lands during the establishment year when trees are most sensitive to soil water deficits domec et al 2017 our main objective was to better understand the factors controlling the evaporative demand of sycamore and its sensitivity to drought stress during establishment we evaluated energy fluxes and actual crop evapotranspiration rates etc act of experimental sycamore src on land considered marginal in the piedmont physiographic region of nc we hypothesized that water use would increase over the course of stand establishment owing to increases in leaf area index lai but that it would also be affected by contemporaneous climatic conditions e g episodic drought low soil moisture availability etc consequently depletion of soil water reserves during periods of low precipitation could pre dispose stands to physiological stress manifested as declines in etc act during times of precipitation deficit data on the water use

surface layer bulk density ranges from 1 5 to 1 6 mg m 3 we used water retention data from ile et al 2021b to fit the van genuchten mualem model mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 and calculate volumetric soil water content θ at field capacity θfc and permanent wilting point θpwp fig 1 which were assumed to be at soil matric potentials ψm of 3 3 and 152 m respectively values for θfc and θpwp were 0 27

grown to a height of about 1 m the field was rain fed during the entire study no fertilizer was applied to the field prior to planting management practices such as weed pest control were not necessary

heat flux density and g is soil heat flux density all in units of w m 2 the sign convention adopted in eq 1 dictates that fluxes away from the surface are negative whereas fluxes toward the surface

sycamore grown in other regions of the usa the kc act values we observed in our study were lower than what was found for other bioenergy crops in the piedmont region of nc stephenson et al 2021 reported that average kc act for mature stands of switchgrass miscanthus fescue corn and sorghum were 0 93 0 97 1 13 1 12 and 1 27 respectively reports in the literature of kc act values for other woody bioenergy species such as poplar and willow for the conditions of nc are lacking however information can be found for such species under different environmental conditions in canada china and european countries fischer et al 2013 using bowen ratio measurements lindroth et al 1994 found that an irrigated stand of willow had a kc act of 1 08 in sweden for mediterranean climatic conditions in italy lysimeter measurements by guidi et al 2008 showed that willow and poplar had high kc act values during first year growth ranging from 1 28 to 2 84 and 1 06 1 90 respectively under extreme arid conditions in china bowen ratio measurements by hou et al 2010 showed that poplar had a maximum kc act of 0 62 by means of eddy flux measurements cai et al 2011 found that on marginal land in central alberta canada poplar had a kc act of 0 43 lastly fischer et al 2018 reported that poplar had a mean annual kc act of 0 82 which ranged from 0 65 to 0 95 across different locations in europe it should be noted that these kc act values are representative of woody species at specific growth stages and environmental conditions where they were obtained and are given here for context rather than direct comparison with the values of our study total etc act for the sycamore field was 482 mm during the establishment phase of the first year after planting fig 8c which represents a surplus of water of 27 mm and rainfall use efficiency of 0 95 i e cumulative etc act divided by cumulative rainfall this suggests that during the establishment year water use by the sycamore field was highly coupled to rainfall we would expect cumulative etc act to increase with tree development greater lai and root system and hypothesize that a mature stand of sycamore may have cumulative etc act values that exceed cumulative rainfall information on sycamore water use for other regions of the usa is currently lacking during the establishment year sycamore used less water than reported for annual bioenergy grasses e g corn and sorghum and mature stands of perennial species e g switchgrass miscanthus and fescue stephenson et al 2021 reported that in the piedmont region of nc cumulative etc act for switchgrass miscanthus fescue corn and sorghum were 847 883 1029 596 and 691 mm respectively higher water use by corn and sorghum is explained by the fact that these crops are fertilized and have high growth rates whereas the perennial species have a longer growing season reports in the literature on water use of other woody bioenergy species in nc are lacking cumulative etc act for different woody bioenergy crops grown in other countries are summarized in table 3 comparison with literature reports show that cumulative etc act of the sycamore field during the establishment year is within values found for other species grown under different environmental conditions research is needed to evaluate and compare the water use of different woody bioenergy species e g sycamore willow poplar etc under the conditions of nc 4 summary and conclusion energy fluxes and etc act rates were examined in an establishing sycamore bioenergy src cropping system on marginal land in the piedmont region of nc focusing on responses to rainfall distribution and soil water deficits as trees developed we found that etc act of the sycamore field was closely coupled to contemporaneous rainfall and 95 of the precipitation incident on the field was returned as etc act leaving a surplus of 27 mm at the end of the year although severe drought was not observed during our study a rapid reduction in etc act was observed after the onset of a drying cycle suggesting sycamore may avoid drought stress by rapidly decreasing physiological activity e g gas exchange as a survival mechanism during this most vulnerable stage of stand development after 13 days of drying etc act rates decreased by 30 and the water use regime of the sycamore field transitioned from an energy limited to water limited at a surface soil water content threshold of about 0 10 m3 m 3 our results indicate that during the establishment year the young sycamore trees were strongly dependent on available soil water at shallow depths due to the limited development of roots systems and therefore lack of access to deep soil water the fact that the establishing trees survived this period of low water availability while competing with intense herbaceous competition suggests sycamore has significant physiological capacity to withstand environmental stress biotic and abiotic making it highly suitable as a bioenergy crop species king et al 2013 continuing studies at our site are being conducted to evaluate water use over the full src cycle 3 4 years in order to assess the water footprint associated with biomass

9167,imbalanced water and fertilizer systems have limited the yield and quality of grapes in extremely arid areas the combined application of organic of and inorganic fertilizers cf has been proven to be one of the practical approaches to improving yield and quality nevertheless very few studies have focused on the irrigation amount in organically fertilized and drip irrigated grapes hence in this study four combined application ratios of organic and inorganic fertilizers 70 of 30 cf 50 of 50 cf 30 of 70 cf and 0 of 100 cf and four irrigation amounts 630 675 720 and 765 mm were set coupling in a two year field experiment generally under four irrigation levels combined organic inorganic fertilizers increased soil nutrients and improved seedless white grape growth yield and quality the results of the combined fertilizer application treatments showed that the content of available nitrogen 55 97 102 60 available phosphorus 49 41 124 74 and available potassium 60 70 124 33 in soil increased significantly compared with those values under a single application of inorganic fertilizer in addition the combined application increased the length of new shoots and leaf midribs grapes by 3 16 11 88 and 7 35 15 15 respectively this application mode also significantly enhanced transpiration rate tr stomatal conductance gs and net photosynthetic rate pn furthermore the grape yield increased by 6 68 19 12 and the fruit quality notably improved except for the index of fruit shape under the four irrigation amounts two year average yields were reported as 17 53 20 60 23 31 and 22 71 kg ha respectively additionally we used four evaluation methods to assess the fruit quality and compared their correlations with the comprehensive evaluation model and we concluded that the principal component analysis method pca is best suited for evaluating drip irrigated grapes quality then we applied the pca to seek proper irrigation management the results displayed that a suitable irrigation amount of 720 mm and the ratio of organic inorganic application of 50 organic fertilizer 50 inorganic fertilizer is recommended however further research is required to investigate the effects of soluble and complete organic fertilizers application on drip irrigated grapes keywords organic fertilizer inorganic fertilizers grape yield fruit quality principal component analysis method data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction grape as a vital cash crop internationally is also a crucial agronomic production in china t li et al 2017 y li et al 2017 the grape planting industry has gained traction in china with the country s grape planting area ranking second globally and the national output has also steadily achieved the highest in the world since 2014 fao 2021 due to its unique climatic conditions and light heat resources xinjiang province has contributed significantly to grape culture development in china accounting for 19 of the planting area and 24 of total grape output nationally nbs 2021 the tuha region of xinjiang with dramatic temperature changes between day and night has thrived as the primary grape plantation base in this province taking up 28 4 of the grape planting area and nearly 40 of the overall grape harvest nbs 2021 however the tuha region has long term been afflicted by inappropriate irrigation models such as excessive application of water and fertilizer which adversely have resulted in production decline waste of water resources and a significant drop in soil fertility consequently local grape industries have been severely undermined li et al 2020 therefore efficient water and fertilizer strategies are essential and urgently needed to promote the local grape yield and quality the farming practices in grape planting vary widely which potentially affects the conditions of irrigated soil tillage and fertilizer application have contributed strongly to the changes in soil properties such as soil bulk in an austrian vineyard zehetner et al 2015 likewise the irrigation and fertilizer regimes have profoundly influenced soil carbon emission thus affecting the soil s organic storage in a vineyard ecosystem zhang et al 2022 moreover drip irrigation systems with variable rates for irrigation and fertilizer have brought about higher environmental sustainability of viticulture in northern italy casson et al 2022 in addition other agroecological practices such as deficit irrigation have mitigated the negative effects of soil conversion and made irrigated mediterranean vineyards more resilient romero et al 2021 collectively cultivation strategies comprehensively affect the grape soil interactions and their potential to improve wue soil vine performance and other ecological services in highly arid areas like the tuha region where precipitation and available water resources are markedly scarce irrigation plays a decisive driver in affecting the growth and development of crops duan et al 2004 generally the modern agricultural system is built based on a perfect balance between economic and technological development which can be achieved by government policies and appropriate field management guidelines t wang et al 2021 x wang et al 2021 for this reason drip irrigation has been introduced because such technology can save 50 70 of irrigation water compared with traditional flood irrigation in production practices drip irrigation can save water consumption of above 1000 m3 in total per year which has been further proven a suitable water saving irrigation method in arid areas li et al 2015 b yang et al 2019 q yang et al 2019 severini et al 2020 by accurately applying water to the roots of crops this technology positively promotes the absorption and utilization of water and nutrients it was then widely utilized to cultivate economic fruit trees such as grapes ma et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 therefore exploring a proper application pattern of drip irrigation is imperative for sustainable development additionally fertilization application also functions crucially regarding the growth and development of the crop indeed the inorganic fertilizer containing abundant nutrients can enhance crop yield and improve quality wu et al 2017 nevertheless the excessive bringing of inorganic fertilizers may generate soil compaction soil acidification and the accumulation of heavy metal ions duan et al 2004 ma et al 2021 hence some alternatives have been recommended such as organic fertilizers which provide nutrients for crop growth and contain a large amount of organic matter and valuable trace elements vital for crops moghaddam et al 2015 trost et al 2014 beyond that organic fertilizers also enhance microorganisms activities in the soil thereby accelerating the decomposition of nutrient elements and promoting plant growth by transforming such elements from an inorganic state challenging to absorb to an organic form easy to take in ardiantika et al 2018 similarly much organic matter can ameliorate the soil properties thus maintaining soil temperature restoring more nutrient element fixation reducing nutrient loss and further lessening the risks of groundwater eutrophication feng et al 2021 ning et al 2017 moreover abundant trace elements can promote plant growth and supplement indispensable nutrients for plants which are generally not contained in inorganic fertilizers lin et al 2021 however on the other hand low contents of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium in organic fertilizers frequently lead to crops abnormal needs for them which can only be met through enhanced capabilities to absorb more nutrients adekiya et al 2020 furthermore the nutrient release rate of organic fertilizer is relatively slow so achieving the desired effects of better yield is challenging if the fertilizer application duration is short t li et al 2017 y li et al 2017 consequently combining the high efficiency of inorganic fertilizer and the long term effects of organic fertilizer is of great importance for agricultural development even numerous types of research have been conducted based on the greenhouse environment which has primarily considered the natural field circumstances or the areas where rainfall is abundant nevertheless the studies based on the dual factors of irrigation and the combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizers in arid areas are relatively limited accordingly based on a two year experiment the objectives of the study are 1 to investigate the appropriate ratios of organic and inorganic fertilizers application for higher yield and better quality in grape planting and 2 to establish an efficient and sustainable irrigation fertilization schedule by exploring the irrigation mode of water fertilizer management and organic inorganic fertilizer this paper hopes to provide a scientific basis for extremely arid areas to improve soil nutrients and enhance grapes yield and quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a two year field trial was conducted consecutively from april 2020 to october 2021 in the hami reclamation irrigation station at the 13th division of the xinjiang production and construction corps latitude 42 41 57 longitude 93 37 22 e this area is characterized by a dry continental climate with significant differences between diurnal and nocturnal temperatures high annual evaporations of 3300 mm an average annual sunshine time of 3358 h a frost free period of 182 d an average annual wind speed of 2 3 4 9 m s with prevailing easterly wind groundwater level greater than 8 0 m local radiation amount of 6397 35 mj m2 10 and the accumulated temperature amounting to 4058 3 in addition the average temperature and precipitation during the growth period reached 23 76 12 1 mm and 23 73 16 8 mm in 2020 and 2021 respectively the soil type from the soil surface to the 80 cm layer is sandy loam and other physical and chemical properties of the 0 80 cm soil layer are presented in table 1 the temperature and precipitation conditions in the test area in 2020 2021 are displayed in fig 1 the test plot covers an area of 0 57 ha with a length of 100 m and a width of 56 m the area of each plot was 240 m2 with a length of 23 m and a width of 10 5 m each treatment was a horizontal spacing of 2 m and a vertical spacing of 5 m 2 2 experimental design and management in this research we selected four irrigation amounts combined with four organic fertilizer of inorganic fertilizer cf application ratios the four irrigation amounts were set up based on 675 mm w2 in total for a growing season which was in line with the local grape irrigated schedule other irrigation quotas 630 720 and 765 mm designated as w1 w3 and w4 respectively were set up to seek for a proper irrigation amount four proportions of fertilizer treatments included 70 of 30 cf 50 of 50 cf 30 of 70 cf 0 of 100 cf designated as f1 f2 f3 and ck respectively based on the equal ratio of the two fertilizers the other ratios were also set to explore rational fertilizer management each treatment was based on the principle of equal nitrogen content and each treatment was replicated three times here potassium fulvic acid n 2 32 p2o5 1 10 k2o 0 97 has been commonly utilized locally due to minimum phosphorus and potassium not included in the total content of phosphorus and potassium and was adopted as organic fertilizer furthermore urea n 46 4 diammonium hydrogen phosphate p2o5 60 5 and potassium sulfate k2o 57 were applied as inorganic fertilizers in which the ratio of n k2o p2o5 was 2 1 2 the fertilization tank amount for irrigation and fertilizer through the whole growth period is shown in table 2 in this experiment the planting density was 1 m with 20 trees per row with two rows for each plot drip irrigation tape with an outer diameter of 32 mm and an inner irrigator spacing of 33 cm was selected the discharge of which was 2 6 l h for each emitter there were three tapes in one row one drip irrigation tape was placed between the two rows on the outside of the tree two drip irrigation tapes were laid beside the root of the vine tree respectively in addition a well a water meter and a fertilizer tank were placed in front of each plot before irrigation organic and inorganic fertilizers that dissolved entirely were added to the fertilizer tank the specific irrigation and fertilization schedules are shown in table 3 at the end of the berry growth period a sample square that was 20 cm away from the roots of vine trees was selected and soil drills were utilized to collect soil samples from soil layer depths of 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 50 50 60 60 70 and 70 80 cm to determine soil moisture and soil nutrients in each treatment three grape trees were randomly chosen in each treatment for fixed point monitoring during the new shoot growth period and the new length of the plant and the leaf s midrib were measured every seven days at the end of the fruit growth period photosynthesis instruments li 6800 li cor united states were used to determine the transpiration rate tr stomatal conductance gs and net photosynthetic rate pn of the plants five plants for yield determination were randomly screened in each treatment at the end of the berry ripening period august 29 2020 and august 28 2021 meanwhile fresh grape samples were randomly picked for quality determination agronomic measures such as removing buds and weeding were consistent with local agronomic practices 2 3 measurements automatic discontinuous chemical analyzer perchloric acid digestion method ivanov et al 2012 and sodium tetraphenylborate method tabbasum et al 2021 were adopted to determine the soil available nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium contents li et al 2012 clever chem anna de chem tech german five plants were randomly sorted to assess the yield at the end of the fruit ripening period the longitudinal and transverse diameters of the grape particles were documented by vernier calipers in each treatment during the same period 2 kg grape samples were collected in each treatment which were then sent to shihezi academy of agricultural sciences for quality evaluation soluble solids ss were appraised by using a handheld sugar meter pal 1 atago tokyo japan hou et al 2019 titratable acid ta was quantified by acid base titration miao et al 2020 vitamin c vc was measured by spectrophotometry peng et al 2020 and reducing sugar rs was determined by 3 5 dinitro determination of salicylic acid colorimetry berzin et al 1995 the fruit shape index fsi was obtained with the following formula li h et al 2021 1 fsi ld td where ld refers to longitudinal diameters mm td represents transverse diameters mm 2 4 methods for evaluating grape fruit quality in our study if we want to explore the optimal irrigation schedule for the yield and quality of grapes various empirical statistical models based on mathematical equations are effective and necessary to establish a comprehensive evaluation system therefore considering different empirical theories and their applicability to crops we selected four statistical methods to assess the quality of drip irrigated grapes the specific methods are principal component analysis pca ferde et al 2021 for order preference similarity to an ideal solution topsis deepa et al 2021 grey relational analysis method gra singh et al 2019 and subordinate function value method sfv gao et al 2014 in the end we cast the combinational evaluation method cem zhou et al 2020 and compare its correlation with the four methods above cem functions as a complete evaluation and is widely adopted with the following five steps 1 construction of the original matrix x 2 x x ij x 11 x 12 x 1 m x 21 x 22 x 2 m x n 1 x n 2 x nm where xij i 1 2 n j 1 2 m denotes the jth measurement ss ta vc rs and fsi from the ith treatment here n 16 and m 5 2 normalization of the matrix 3 spearman correlation analysis was adopted to assess the correlation between the ranking of each quality indicator and the ranking of the comprehensive quality evaluation 4 the weight of each evaluation method was determined as follows 3 w k ρ k j 1 16 ρ j where ρk represents the sum of the spearman correlation coefficient of each evaluation method k 1 2 3 m and j 1 2 3 m 5 calculate the score of cem 4 q j 1 4 w j z ij where zij refers to the comprehensive quality index value of grape as determined by pca topsis gra and sfv 2 5 data analysis microsoft excel 2017 was employed for data collection the calculation of each score and the arrangement of the calculated data then spss 22 0 was used for the analysis of the data and their variance finally origin 2021 was utilized for graphical presentation 3 results 3 1 soil nutrient irrigation and fertilization factors significantly affect soil s available nitrogen an available phosphorus ap and available potassium ak table 4 under the same fertilization level an ap and ak gradually decreased with the increase in irrigation amount comparatively when applying the same amount of irrigation ck an ap and ak increased by 55 97 102 60 49 41 124 74 and 60 70 124 33 in different fertilization levels f1 f2 and f3 respectively in these cases an and ap were expressed as f2 f1 f3 ck and ak was described as f1 f2 f3 ck 3 2 growth and photosynthetic of grape the combined irrigation fertilization management can have an impact on the length of new shoots and the midrib length of grape leaves fig 2 and fig 3 when the fertilizer level keeps uniform the new shoots length and the leaf midrib length gradually increased with the enhancement of the irrigation level fig 2 and fig 3 in the w1 level the new shoot length of ck was higher conversely under irrigation levels of w2 w3 and w4 the new shoot lengths of f1 f2 and f3 were all higher than that in ck furthermore when implementing the same irrigation amount the length of the leaf midrib was greater in f1 f2 and f3 than in ck additionally the interaction between water and fertilizer exerted noticeable effects on tr gs and pn p 0 01 fig 4 specifically under the same fertilization degree tr gs and pn gradually increased with enhancing irrigation levels in w4 the annual average values of tr 5 99 mmol m2s gs 330 25 mmol m2s and pn 33 76 mmol m2s all reached the maximum on the other hand when the irrigation amount was identical tr gs and pn first elevated and then decreased with increased organic fertilizer content moreover at the f2 fertilization treatments the values of tr 5 98 mmol m2s gs 316 48 mmol m2s and pn 31 85 mmol m2s all achieved the highest 3 3 yield and quality in this experiment the highest yield was 25 82 t ha w3f2 and the lowest was 17 26 t ha w1ck under the same fertilizer level grape yield gradually increased with the irrigation level fig 5 moreover under the same irrigation amount grape yield increased gradually f1 and f2 fertilization levels and decreased steadily f3 and f4 fertilization levels with more organic fertilizer content the annual average yield under the f2 fertilization level was 9 80 11 66 and 19 12 higher than those under f1 f3 and ck respectively the grape quality was also affected by the amount of irrigation water plus fertilization p 0 01 except for ta in 2021 fig 6 the interaction between water and fertilizer had significant effects on vc in 2020 while such effects influenced more on ss vc and rs in 2021 in addition under the same fertilization standard ss and lsi increased and then decreased with the elevated irrigation level however ta vc and rs rose steadily in 2020 ss ta vc and rs all appeared to increase first and then declined in 2021 in the irrigation level of w3 the annual average values of ss 21 65 ta 0 5302 vc 8 25 mg kg and rs 22 69 all reached the maximum on the other hand under the same irrigation level with the improvement of organic fertilizer content ss vc and rs first increased and then decreased however ta first reduced and then raised and fsi showed a decreased tendency under the f2 fertilization level the annual average values of ss 21 89 vc 8 01 mg kg and rs 23 36 all came to the highest value and ta 0 5278 amounted to the largest under the ck fertilization level fsi arrived at the largest under the f3 fertilization level 3 4 comprehensive assessment of fruit quality and yield with different methods the comprehensive fruit quality average value for 2020 and 2021 scores calculated by pca topsis gra and sfv are shown in table 5 pca and sfv showed that w4f2 1 77 and 0 883 ranked first and w1ck 2 05 and 0 188 was last topsis and gra showed that w3f2 0 975 and 0 986 was at the top among all treatments and w1ck 0 009 and 0 617 was the previous although there are some inconsistencies in the ranking of various analysis methods the average values of the kendall correlation coefficients of pca topsis gra and sfv were 0 866 0 818 0 865 and 0 842 respectively table 6 which were relatively consistent therefore it is feasible to establish a combined model based on pca topsis gra and sfv cem showed that w4f2 1 146 has the highest fruit quality score the analysis showed that the average spearman correlation coefficients of cem with pca topsis gra and sfv were 0 994 0 940 0 975 and 0 976 respectively table 7 the correlation between pca and cev was the highest indicating that pca is the best evaluation method to judge the quality of grapes then the pca was continued using to calculate the ranking scores of all treatments by assessing the fruit quality indexes plus the grape yield shown in table 8 the two year ranking scores showed that w3f2 3 80 in 2020 and 3 58 in 2021 is the best irrigation amount and combined organic and inorganic fertilizers for grape production the average two year score of w3f2 3 69 has the highest score the results revealed that when the irrigation amount reached 765 mm the amounts of organic fertilizer nitrogen fertilizer phosphate fertilizer and potassium fertilizer were applied in a total of 6500 kg ha 150 kg ha 300 kg ha and 150 kg ha respectively then the grape fruit quality was found the best table 5 4 discussion 4 1 effects of irrigation quantity organic fertilizer and inorganic fertilizer application on soil nutrient increasing the contents of soil nitrogen phosphorus and potassium is a crucial measure to improve soil fertility vanlauwe et al 2011 in this experiment an ap and ak gradually decreased as the amount of irrigation increased table 4 generally an ap and ak have a specific solubility in water and will migrate with the mass flow effects of water feng et al 2012 compared with fertilizer applications only considering the inorganic matter adding organic fertilizers can significantly enhance the soil s contents of available nitrogen phosphorus and potassium table 4 furthermore a large amount of organic matter in organic fertilizer can promote the activity of soil microorganisms and enzymes and convert nutrients from the inorganic state that is difficult to decompose into a form that crops can easily absorb ding et al 2017 yang et al 2019 at the same time the colloid of organic fertilizer will absorb nutrient elements in the soil and hence reduce the loss prommer et al 2014 thereby increasing the contents of an ap and ak in the soil under the combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizers in this research the available nitrogen and available phosphorus can be arranged as f2 f1 f3 in contrast the contents of available potassium can be ranked as f1 f2 f3 table 4 the study results are consistent because excessive organic fertilizer contents have affected the nutrient absorption of crops thus resulting in lower levels of available nitrogen and available phosphorus in the f1 treatment than f2 treatment sunarpi et al 2021 4 2 effects of irrigation quantity organic fertilizer and inorganic fertilizer application on growth and physiology of grape all physiological activities of plants are inseparable from the irrigation water under the same fertilization level the length of the grapes new shoots and leaf midribs gradually increased as the irrigation increased fig 3 since water is a critical factor in transporting nutrients and supporting all physiological activities needed by plant growth seeking proper irrigation patterns can promote crop growth and development wang et al 2011 specifically when implementing the same irrigation volume the length of new shoots and leaf midribs under f1 f2 and f3 are higher than that under the ck group fig 3 in this case the combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizers contains more effective nutrients which can be accessible to plants thus promoting their growth and development sunarpi et al 2019 in addition the growth rate of new shoots and leaf midribs at ck was higher than those of the combined application of organic fertilizer under w1 and w2 irrigation levels fig 3 which was attributed to the low solubility and the inability of releasing nutrients by organic fertilizers in the early stage of irrigation le et al 2020 with the release of nutrients in organic matter the growth rate accelerated gradually consequently within the f1 f2 and f3 fertilization levels the length of new shoots and leaf midribs were higher at the end of the new shoot period adekiya et al 2020 various environmental factors including water air light and heat drive the growth functions of plants this study showed that all the tr gs and pn of grapes exhibited a gradual increase with the enhancement of irrigation fig 4 regarding the condition that sufficient irrigation can make the leaf stomata larger and improve the gas exchange efficiency and transpiration espadafor et al 2017 however nemeskéri et al 2019 indicated that under severe drought conditions high temperatures resulted in the degradation of chlorophyll so the absorption of light by chloroplasts declined thus reducing the photosynthetic function of plants proper irrigation increased the growth of crop leaves so that the photosynthetic area was sufficient and the light interception rate improved nemeskéri et al 2019 we found that the combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizers significantly increased tr gs and pn in grapes fig 4 organic fertilizer can regulate the fixation and release of soil nitrogen coordinate the supply of soil nutrients and promote each other s fertilizer efficiency liu et al 2018 on the one hand it has encouraged the maturity of organic fertilizers the soil organic matter content increased and soil fertility improved b yang et al 2019 q yang et al 2019 on the other hand it reduced the contact of inorganic fertilizers with soil the fixation of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium improving the utilization of soil nutrients yang et al 2018 this combination has also listed tr gs and pn as f2 f3 f1 in this experiment fig 4 which can be explained by the f2 50 50 cf fertilization level containing enough organic matter to strengthen the role of nitrogen fertilizers moreover the combined application of organic fertilizers and inorganic fertilizers can provide more comprehensive and available nutrients thus improving the soil s physical chemical and biological properties ding et al 2017 therefore this combined application is more conducive to the growth and development of crops the enhancement of enzyme activities the improvement of photosynthetic efficiency and the postponement of leaf senescence t wang et al 2021 x wang et al 2021 4 3 effects of irrigation quantity organic fertilizer and inorganic fertilizer application on yield and quality of grape grape yield and quality are essential indicators for increasing profits and measuring crop nutrition a sound irrigation system affects the growth of grapes and significantly improves the yield and quality thereby improving both nutritionally and economically pokhrel et al 2019 chirinda et al 2012 this study showed that as the level of irrigation increased grape yield ss and rs first increased and then gradually decreased but under the w1 irrigation level the variation of the yield was not significant figs 5 and 6 the content of ta and vc gradually increased fig 6 moreover over irrigation inhibited crop growth prolonged the maturation process and exerted diluting effects on ss and rs thus resulting in a yield decrease acevedo opazo et al 2010 have demonstrated that higher irrigation levels can improve grapes soluble solids and anthocyanins and increase crop yield besides uriarte et al 2016 found that irrigation increased the titratable acid of grapes and improved the composition of berries these conclusions are similar to the results of this experiment furthermore with the enhancement of organic fertilizer content no more than 50 the range of ss vc and rs increased significantly however when the organic fertilizer increased to 75 the soil s contents of ss vc and rs decreased fig 6 yields under f1 f2 and f3 were significantly higher than those under ck except for the w1 irrigation level fig 5 all these conditions happen because organic matter can increase the content of adequate nutrients in the soil and increase the absorption and utilization of nutrients but when the irrigation amount was lower than 650 mm the interaction of irrigation and fertilizer was not adequate and the effects functioned limitedly on the crop yield exerting the non significance of the yields under the same irrigation zhu et al 2020 however excessive organic fertilizer can inhibit soil microbial activity and reduce nutrient absorption which explains why higher organic fertilizer application has exerted lower yield bandenay et al 2021 although marlina et al 2017 highlighted that applying 25 organic fertilizer and 75 inorganic fertilizer increased the yield of corn significantly in our study the varieties in crops differed and the physical and chemical properties and types of organic fertilizers will change as well therefore we can see that the combined application of organic fertilizers and inorganic fertilizers improved the soil environment enhanced the absorption and utilization of nutrients thus ensuring the regular operation of plant physiological functions and improved the yield and quality of grapes to a certain extent 4 4 comprehensive assessment of fruit quality and yield based on multiple years of field observation data and the utilization of pca topsis gra and sfv evaluation methods many studies have established the optimal models of the relationships between irrigation and fertilization and fruit quality zhou et al 2020 in this study under the w3 irrigation level ss vc and rs were found to be the highest but the fsi and ta were reduced fig 6 as the effects of irrigation amount and the ratio of organic inorganic fertilizers on grape quality were complex qualitative analysis alone cannot reveal the effects of their interactions optimizing the irrigation amounts and the combined application strategies of organic and inorganic fertilizers weighs the relationships among growth photosynthesis yield and quality this study estimated that pca is the best judgment method for grape quality therefore pca is adopted to evaluate the optimal irrigation amount and the ratios of organic fertilizer to inorganic fertilizer for seedless white grapes in extremely arid regions according to pca w3f2 processing ranked first therefore the combination of w3 irrigation volume 720 mm and f2 fertilization ratio organic fertilizer 50 inorganic fertilizer 50 is the optimal strategy for irrigation volume and organic inorganic fertilizer management for seedless white grapes table 8 5 conclusions based on two consecutive years of field tests in this study combining organic and inorganic fertilizers can significantly increase the contents of soil s available nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium total irrigation amounts w3 720 mm and w4 765 mm same fertilizer level significantly improved grape growth photosynthesis yield and fruit quality except for fruit morphology index

9167,imbalanced water and fertilizer systems have limited the yield and quality of grapes in extremely arid areas the combined application of organic of and inorganic fertilizers cf has been proven to be one of the practical approaches to improving yield and quality nevertheless very few studies have focused on the irrigation amount in organically fertilized and drip irrigated grapes hence in this study four combined application ratios of organic and inorganic fertilizers 70 of 30 cf 50 of 50 cf 30 of 70 cf and 0 of 100 cf and four irrigation amounts 630 675 720 and 765 mm were set coupling in a two year field experiment generally under four irrigation levels combined organic inorganic fertilizers increased soil nutrients and improved seedless white grape growth yield and quality the results of the combined fertilizer application treatments showed that the content of available nitrogen 55 97 102 60 available phosphorus 49 41 124 74 and available potassium 60 70 124 33 in soil increased significantly compared with those values under a single application of inorganic fertilizer in addition the combined application increased the length of new shoots and leaf midribs grapes by 3 16 11 88 and 7 35 15 15 respectively this application mode also significantly enhanced transpiration rate tr stomatal conductance gs and net photosynthetic rate pn furthermore the grape yield increased by 6 68 19 12 and the fruit quality notably improved except for the index of fruit shape under the four irrigation amounts two year average yields were reported as 17 53 20 60 23 31 and 22 71 kg ha respectively additionally we used four evaluation methods to assess the fruit quality and compared their correlations with the comprehensive evaluation model and we concluded that the principal component analysis method pca is best suited for evaluating drip irrigated grapes quality then we applied the pca to seek proper irrigation management the results displayed that a suitable irrigation amount of 720 mm and the ratio of organic inorganic application of 50 organic fertilizer 50 inorganic fertilizer is recommended however further research is required to investigate the effects of soluble and complete organic fertilizers application on drip irrigated grapes keywords organic fertilizer inorganic fertilizers grape yield fruit quality principal component analysis method data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction grape as a vital cash crop internationally is also a crucial agronomic production in china t li et al 2017 y li et al 2017 the grape planting industry has gained traction in china with the country s grape planting area ranking second globally and the national output has also steadily achieved the highest in the world since 2014 fao 2021 due to its unique climatic conditions and light heat resources xinjiang province has contributed significantly to grape culture development in china accounting for 19 of the planting area and 24 of total grape output nationally nbs 2021 the tuha region of xinjiang with dramatic temperature changes between day and night has thrived as the primary grape plantation base in this province taking up 28 4 of the grape planting area and nearly 40 of the overall grape harvest nbs 2021 however the tuha region has long term been afflicted by inappropriate irrigation models such as excessive application of water and fertilizer which adversely have resulted in production decline waste of water resources and a significant drop in soil fertility consequently local grape industries have been severely undermined li et al 2020 therefore efficient water and fertilizer strategies are essential and urgently needed to promote the local grape yield and quality the farming practices in grape planting vary widely which potentially affects the conditions of irrigated soil tillage and fertilizer application have contributed strongly to the changes in soil properties such as soil bulk in an austrian vineyard zehetner et al 2015 likewise the irrigation and fertilizer regimes have profoundly influenced soil carbon emission thus affecting the soil s organic storage in a vineyard ecosystem zhang et al 2022 moreover drip irrigation systems with variable rates for irrigation and fertilizer have brought about higher environmental sustainability of viticulture in northern italy casson et al 2022 in addition other agroecological practices such as deficit irrigation have mitigated the negative effects of soil conversion and made irrigated mediterranean vineyards more resilient romero et al 2021 collectively cultivation strategies comprehensively affect the grape soil interactions and their potential to improve wue soil vine performance and other ecological services in highly arid areas like the tuha region where precipitation and available water resources are markedly scarce irrigation plays a decisive driver in affecting the growth and development of crops duan et al 2004 generally the modern agricultural system is built based on a perfect balance between economic and technological development which can be achieved by government policies and appropriate field management guidelines t wang et al 2021 x wang et al 2021 for this reason drip irrigation has been introduced because such technology can save 50 70 of irrigation water compared with traditional flood irrigation in production practices drip irrigation can save water consumption of above 1000 m3 in total per year which has been further proven a suitable water saving irrigation method in arid areas li et al 2015 b yang et al 2019 q yang et al 2019 severini et al 2020 by accurately applying water to the roots of crops this technology positively promotes the absorption and utilization of water and nutrients it was then widely utilized to cultivate economic fruit trees such as grapes ma et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 therefore exploring a proper application pattern of drip irrigation is imperative for sustainable development additionally fertilization application also functions crucially regarding the growth and development of the crop indeed the inorganic fertilizer containing abundant nutrients can enhance crop yield and improve quality wu et al 2017 nevertheless the excessive bringing of inorganic fertilizers may generate soil compaction soil acidification and the accumulation of heavy metal ions duan et al 2004 ma et al 2021 hence some alternatives have been recommended such as organic fertilizers which provide nutrients for crop growth and contain a large amount of organic matter and valuable trace elements vital for crops moghaddam et al 2015 trost et al 2014 beyond that organic fertilizers also enhance microorganisms activities in the soil thereby accelerating the decomposition of nutrient elements and promoting plant growth by transforming such elements from an inorganic state challenging to absorb to an organic form easy to take in ardiantika et al 2018 similarly much organic matter can ameliorate the soil properties thus maintaining soil temperature restoring more nutrient element fixation reducing nutrient loss and further lessening the risks of groundwater eutrophication feng et al 2021 ning et al 2017 moreover abundant trace elements can promote plant growth and supplement indispensable nutrients for plants which are generally not contained in inorganic fertilizers lin et al 2021 however on the other hand low contents of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium in organic fertilizers frequently lead to crops abnormal needs for them which can only be met through enhanced capabilities to absorb more nutrients adekiya et al 2020 furthermore the nutrient release rate of organic fertilizer is relatively slow so achieving the desired effects of better yield is challenging if the fertilizer application duration is short t li et al 2017 y li et al 2017 consequently combining the high efficiency of inorganic fertilizer and the long term effects of organic fertilizer is of great importance for agricultural development even numerous types of research have been conducted based on the greenhouse environment which has primarily considered the natural field circumstances or the areas where rainfall is abundant nevertheless the studies based on the dual factors of irrigation and the combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizers in arid areas are relatively limited accordingly based on a two year experiment the objectives of the study are 1 to investigate the appropriate ratios of organic and inorganic fertilizers application for higher yield and better quality in grape planting and 2 to establish an efficient and sustainable irrigation fertilization schedule by exploring the irrigation mode of water fertilizer management and organic inorganic fertilizer this paper hopes to provide a scientific basis for extremely arid areas to improve soil nutrients and enhance grapes yield and quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a two year field trial was conducted consecutively from april 2020 to october 2021 in the hami reclamation irrigation station at the 13th division of the xinjiang production and construction corps latitude 42 41 57 longitude 93 37 22 e this area is characterized by a dry continental climate with significant differences between diurnal and nocturnal

growth period reached 23 76 12 1 mm and 23 73 16 8 mm in 2020 and 2021 respectively the soil type from the soil surface to the 80 cm layer is sandy loam and other physical and chemical properties of the 0 80 cm soil layer are presented in table 1 the temperature and precipitation conditions in the test area in 2020 2021 are displayed in fig 1 the test plot covers an area of 0 57 ha with a length of 100 m and a width of 56 m the area of each plot was 240 m2 with a length of 23 m and a width of 10 5 m each treatment was a horizontal spacing of 2 m and a vertical spacing of 5 m 2 2 experimental design and management in this research we selected four irrigation amounts combined with four organic fertilizer of inorganic fertilizer cf application ratios the four irrigation amounts were set up based on 675 mm w2 in total for a growing season which was in line with the local grape irrigated schedule other irrigation quotas 630 720 and 765 mm designated as w1 w3 and w4 respectively were set up to seek for a proper irrigation amount four proportions of fertilizer treatments included 70 of 30 cf 50 of 50 cf 30 of 70 cf 0 of 100 cf designated as f1 f2 f3 and ck respectively based on the equal ratio of the two fertilizers the other ratios were also set to explore rational fertilizer management each treatment was based on the principle of equal nitrogen content and each treatment was replicated three times here potassium fulvic acid n 2 32 p2o5 1 10 k2o 0 97 has been commonly utilized locally due to minimum phosphorus and potassium not included in the total content of phosphorus and potassium and was adopted as organic fertilizer furthermore urea n 46 4 diammonium hydrogen phosphate p2o5 60 5 and potassium sulfate k2o 57 were applied as inorganic fertilizers in which the ratio of n k2o p2o5 was 2 1 2 the fertilization tank amount for irrigation and fertilizer through the whole growth period is shown in table 2 in this experiment the planting density was 1 m with 20 trees per row with two rows for each plot drip irrigation tape with an outer diameter of 32 mm and an inner irrigator spacing of 33 cm was selected the discharge of which was 2 6 l h for each emitter there were three tapes in one row one drip irrigation tape was placed between the two rows on the outside of the tree two drip irrigation tapes were laid beside the root of the vine tree respectively in addition a well a water meter and a fertilizer tank were placed in front of each plot before irrigation organic and inorganic fertilizers that dissolved entirely were added to the fertilizer tank the specific irrigation and fertilization schedules are shown in table 3 at the end of the berry growth period a sample square that was 20 cm away from the roots of vine trees was selected and soil drills were utilized to collect soil samples from soil layer depths of 0 10 10 20 20 30 30 40 40 50 50 60 60 70 and 70 80 cm to determine soil moisture and soil nutrients in each treatment three grape trees were randomly chosen in each treatment for fixed point monitoring during the new shoot growth period and the new length of the plant and the leaf s midrib were measured every seven days at the end of the fruit growth period photosynthesis instruments li 6800 li cor united states were used to determine the transpiration rate tr stomatal conductance gs and net photosynthetic rate pn of the plants five plants for yield determination were randomly screened in each treatment at the end of the berry ripening period august 29 2020 and august 28 2021 meanwhile fresh grape samples were randomly picked for quality determination agronomic measures such as removing buds and weeding were consistent with local agronomic practices 2 3 measurements automatic discontinuous chemical analyzer perchloric acid digestion method ivanov et al 2012 and sodium tetraphenylborate method tabbasum et al 2021 were adopted to determine the soil available nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium contents li et al 2012 clever chem anna de chem tech german five plants were randomly sorted to assess the yield at the end of the fruit ripening period the longitudinal and transverse diameters of the grape particles were documented by vernier calipers in each treatment during the same period 2 kg grape samples were collected in each treatment which were then sent to shihezi academy of agricultural sciences for quality evaluation soluble solids ss were appraised by using a handheld sugar meter pal 1 atago tokyo japan hou et al 2019 titratable acid ta was quantified by acid base titration miao et al 2020 vitamin c vc was measured by spectrophotometry peng et al 2020 and reducing sugar rs was determined by 3 5 dinitro determination of salicylic acid colorimetry berzin et al 1995 the fruit shape index fsi was obtained with the following formula li h et al 2021 1 fsi ld td where ld refers to longitudinal diameters mm td represents transverse diameters mm 2 4 methods for evaluating grape fruit quality in our study if we want to explore the optimal irrigation schedule for the yield and quality of grapes various empirical statistical models based on mathematical equations are effective and necessary to establish a comprehensive evaluation system therefore considering different empirical theories and their applicability to crops we selected four statistical methods to assess the quality of drip irrigated grapes the specific methods are principal component analysis pca ferde et al 2021 for order preference similarity to an ideal solution topsis deepa et al 2021 grey relational analysis method gra singh et al 2019 and subordinate function value method sfv gao et al 2014 in the end we cast the combinational evaluation method cem zhou et al 2020 and compare its correlation with the four methods above cem functions as a complete evaluation and is widely adopted with the following five steps 1 construction of the original matrix x 2 x x ij x 11 x 12 x 1 m x 21 x 22 x 2 m x n 1 x n 2 x nm where xij i 1 2 n j 1 2 m denotes the jth measurement ss ta vc rs and fsi from the ith treatment here n 16 and m 5 2 normalization of the matrix 3 spearman correlation analysis was adopted to assess the correlation between the ranking of each quality indicator and the ranking of the comprehensive quality evaluation 4 the weight of each evaluation method was determined as follows 3 w k ρ k j 1 16 ρ j where ρk represents the sum of the spearman correlation coefficient of each evaluation method k 1 2 3 m and j 1 2 3 m 5 calculate the score of cem 4 q j 1 4 w j z ij where zij refers to the comprehensive quality index value of grape as determined by pca topsis gra and sfv 2 5 data analysis microsoft excel 2017 was employed for data collection the calculation of each score and the arrangement of the calculated data then spss 22 0 was used for the analysis of the data and their variance finally origin 2021 was utilized for graphical presentation 3 results 3 1 soil nutrient irrigation and fertilization factors significantly affect soil s available nitrogen an available phosphorus ap and available potassium ak table 4 under the same fertilization level an ap and ak gradually decreased with the increase in irrigation amount comparatively when applying the same amount of irrigation ck an ap and ak increased by 55 97 102 60 49 41 124 74 and 60 70 124 33 in different fertilization levels f1 f2 and f3 respectively in these cases an and ap were expressed as f2 f1 f3 ck and ak was described as f1 f2 f3 ck 3 2 growth and photosynthetic of grape the combined irrigation fertilization management can have an impact on the length of new shoots and the midrib length of grape leaves fig 2 and fig 3 when the fertilizer level keeps uniform the new shoots length and the leaf midrib length gradually increased with the enhancement of the irrigation level fig 2 and fig 3 in the w1 level the new shoot length of ck was higher conversely under irrigation levels of w2 w3 and w4 the new shoot lengths of f1 f2 and f3 were all higher than that in ck furthermore when implementing the same irrigation amount the length of the leaf midrib was greater in f1 f2 and f3 than in ck additionally the interaction between water and fertilizer exerted noticeable effects on tr gs and pn p 0 01 fig 4 specifically under the same fertilization degree tr gs and pn gradually increased with enhancing irrigation levels in w4 the annual average values of tr 5 99 mmol m2s gs 330 25 mmol m2s and pn 33 76 mmol m2s all reached the maximum on the other hand when the irrigation amount was identical tr gs and pn first elevated and then decreased with increased organic fertilizer content moreover at the f2 fertilization treatments the values of tr 5 98 mmol m2s gs 316 48 mmol m2s and pn 31 85 mmol m2s all achieved the highest 3 3 yield and quality in this experiment the highest yield was 25 82 t ha w3f2 and the lowest was 17 26 t ha w1ck under the same fertilizer level grape yield gradually increased with the irrigation level fig 5 moreover under the same irrigation amount grape yield increased gradually f1 and f2 fertilization levels and decreased steadily f3 and f4 fertilization levels with more organic fertilizer content the annual average yield under the f2 fertilization level was 9 80 11 66 and 19 12 higher than those under f1 f3 and ck respectively the grape quality was also affected by the amount of irrigation water plus fertilization p 0 01 except for ta in 2021 fig 6 the interaction between water and fertilizer had significant effects on vc in 2020 while such effects influenced more on ss vc and rs in 2021 in addition under the same fertilization standard ss and lsi increased and then decreased with the elevated irrigation level however ta vc and rs rose steadily in 2020 ss ta vc and rs all appeared to increase first and then declined in 2021 in the irrigation level of w3 the annual average values of ss 21 65 ta 0 5302 vc 8 25 mg kg and rs 22 69 all reached the maximum on the other hand under the same irrigation level with the improvement of organic fertilizer content ss vc and rs first increased and then decreased however ta first reduced and then raised and fsi showed a decreased tendency under the f2 fertilization level the annual average values of ss 21 89 vc 8 01 mg kg and rs 23 36 all came to the highest value and ta 0 5278 amounted to the largest under the ck fertilization level fsi arrived at the largest under the f3 fertilization level 3 4 comprehensive assessment of fruit quality and yield with different methods the comprehensive fruit quality average value for 2020 and 2021 scores calculated by pca topsis gra and sfv are shown in table 5 pca and sfv showed that w4f2 1 77 and 0 883 ranked first and w1ck 2 05 and 0 188 was last topsis and gra showed that w3f2 0 975 and 0 986 was at the top among all treatments and w1ck 0 009 and 0 617 was the previous although there are some inconsistencies in the ranking of various analysis methods the average values of the kendall correlation coefficients of pca topsis gra and sfv were 0 866 0 818 0 865 and 0 842 respectively table 6 which were relatively consistent therefore it is feasible to establish a combined model based on pca topsis gra and sfv cem showed that w4f2 1 146 has the highest fruit quality score the analysis showed that the average spearman correlation coefficients of cem with pca topsis gra and sfv were 0 994 0 940 0 975 and 0 976 respectively table 7 the correlation between pca and cev was the highest indicating that pca is the best evaluation method to judge the quality of grapes then the pca was continued using to calculate the ranking scores of all treatments by assessing the fruit quality indexes plus the grape yield shown in table 8 the two year ranking scores showed that w3f2 3 80 in 2020 and 3 58 in 2021 is the best irrigation amount and combined organic and inorganic fertilizers for grape production the average two year score of w3f2 3 69 has the highest score the results revealed that when the irrigation amount reached 765 mm the amounts of organic fertilizer nitrogen fertilizer phosphate fertilizer and potassium fertilizer were applied in a total of 6500 kg ha 150 kg ha 300 kg ha and 150 kg ha respectively then the grape fruit quality was found the best table 5 4 discussion 4 1 effects of irrigation quantity organic fertilizer and inorganic fertilizer application on soil nutrient increasing the contents of soil nitrogen phosphorus and potassium is a crucial measure to improve soil fertility vanlauwe et al 2011 in this experiment an ap and ak gradually decreased as the amount of irrigation increased table 4 generally an ap and ak have a specific solubility in water and will migrate with the mass flow effects of water feng et al 2012 compared with fertilizer applications only considering the inorganic matter adding organic fertilizers can significantly enhance the soil s contents of available nitrogen phosphorus and potassium table 4 furthermore a large amount of organic matter in organic fertilizer can promote the activity of soil microorganisms and enzymes and convert nutrients from the inorganic state that is difficult to decompose into a form that crops can easily absorb ding et al 2017 yang et al 2019 at the same time the colloid of organic fertilizer will absorb nutrient elements in the soil and hence reduce the loss prommer et al 2014 thereby increasing the contents of an ap and ak in the soil under the combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizers in this research the available nitrogen and available phosphorus can be arranged as f2 f1 f3 in contrast the contents of available potassium can be ranked as f1 f2 f3 table 4 the study results are consistent because excessive organic fertilizer contents have affected the nutrient absorption of crops thus resulting in lower levels of available nitrogen and available phosphorus in the f1 treatment than f2 treatment sunarpi et al 2021 4 2 effects of irrigation quantity organic fertilizer and inorganic fertilizer application on growth and physiology of grape all physiological activities of plants are inseparable from the irrigation water under the same fertilization level the length of the grapes new shoots and leaf midribs gradually increased as the irrigation increased fig 3 since water is a critical factor in transporting nutrients and supporting all physiological activities needed by plant growth seeking proper irrigation patterns can promote crop growth and development wang et al 2011 specifically when implementing the same irrigation volume the length of new shoots and leaf midribs under f1 f2 and f3 are higher than that under the ck group fig 3 in this case the combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizers contains more effective nutrients which can be accessible to plants thus promoting their growth and development sunarpi et al 2019 in addition the growth rate of new shoots and leaf midribs at ck was higher than those of the combined application of organic fertilizer under w1 and w2 irrigation levels fig 3 which was attributed to the low solubility and the inability of releasing nutrients by organic fertilizers in the early stage of irrigation le et al 2020 with the release of nutrients in organic matter the growth rate accelerated gradually consequently within the f1 f2 and f3 fertilization levels the length of new shoots and leaf midribs were higher at the end of the new shoot period adekiya et al 2020 various environmental factors including water air light and heat drive the growth functions of plants this study showed that all the tr gs and pn of grapes exhibited a gradual increase with the enhancement of irrigation fig 4 regarding the condition that sufficient irrigation can make the leaf stomata larger and improve the gas exchange efficiency and transpiration espadafor et al 2017 however nemeskéri et al 2019 indicated that under severe drought conditions high temperatures resulted in the degradation of chlorophyll so the absorption of light by chloroplasts declined thus reducing the photosynthetic function of plants proper irrigation increased the growth of crop leaves so that the photosynthetic area was sufficient and the light interception rate improved nemeskéri et al 2019 we found that the combined application of organic and inorganic fertilizers significantly increased tr gs and pn in grapes fig 4 organic fertilizer can regulate the fixation and release of soil nitrogen coordinate the supply of soil nutrients and promote each other s fertilizer efficiency liu et al 2018 on the one hand it has encouraged the maturity of organic fertilizers the soil organic matter content increased and soil fertility improved b yang et al 2019 q yang et al 2019 on the other hand it reduced the contact of inorganic fertilizers with soil the fixation of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium improving the utilization of soil nutrients yang et al 2018 this combination has also listed tr gs and pn as f2 f3 f1 in this experiment fig 4 which can be explained by the f2 50 50 cf fertilization level containing enough organic matter to strengthen the role of nitrogen fertilizers moreover the combined application of organic fertilizers and inorganic fertilizers can provide more comprehensive and available nutrients thus improving the soil s physical chemical and biological properties ding et al 2017 therefore this combined application is more conducive to the growth and development of crops the enhancement of enzyme activities the improvement of photosynthetic efficiency and the postponement of leaf senescence t wang et al 2021 x wang et al 2021 4 3 effects of irrigation quantity organic fertilizer and inorganic fertilizer application on yield and quality of grape grape yield and quality are essential indicators for increasing profits and measuring crop nutrition a sound irrigation system affects the growth of grapes and significantly improves the yield and quality thereby improving both nutritionally and economically pokhrel et al 2019 chirinda et al 2012 this study showed that as the level of irrigation increased grape yield ss and rs first increased and then gradually decreased but under the w1 irrigation level the variation of the yield was not significant figs 5 and 6 the content of ta and vc gradually increased fig 6 moreover over irrigation inhibited crop growth prolonged the maturation process and exerted diluting effects on ss and rs thus resulting in a yield decrease acevedo opazo et al 2010 have demonstrated that higher irrigation levels can improve grapes soluble solids and anthocyanins and increase crop yield besides uriarte et al 2016 found that irrigation increased the titratable acid of grapes and improved the composition of berries these conclusions are similar to the results of this experiment furthermore with the enhancement of organic fertilizer content no more than 50 the range of ss vc and rs increased significantly however when the organic fertilizer increased to 75 the soil s contents of ss vc and rs decreased fig 6 yields under f1 f2 and f3 were significantly higher than those under ck except for the w1 irrigation level fig 5 all these conditions happen because organic matter can increase the content of adequate nutrients in the soil and increase the absorption and utilization of nutrients but when the irrigation amount was lower than 650 mm the interaction of irrigation and fertilizer was not adequate and the effects functioned limitedly on the crop yield exerting the non significance of the yields under the same irrigation zhu et al 2020 however excessive organic fertilizer can inhibit soil microbial activity and reduce nutrient absorption which explains why higher organic fertilizer application has exerted lower yield bandenay et al 2021 although marlina et al 2017 highlighted that applying 25 organic fertilizer and 75 inorganic fertilizer increased the yield of corn significantly in our study the varieties in crops differed and the physical and chemical properties and types of organic fertilizers will change as well therefore we can see that the combined application of organic fertilizers and inorganic fertilizers improved the soil environment enhanced the absorption and utilization of nutrients thus ensuring the regular operation of plant physiological functions and improved the yield and quality of grapes to a certain extent 4 4 comprehensive assessment of fruit quality and yield based on multiple years of field observation data and the utilization of pca topsis gra and sfv evaluation methods many studies have established the optimal models of the relationships between irrigation and fertilization and fruit quality zhou et al 2020 in this study under the w3 irrigation level ss vc and rs were found to be the highest but the fsi and ta were reduced fig 6 as the effects of irrigation amount and the ratio of organic inorganic fertilizers on grape quality were complex qualitative analysis alone cannot reveal the effects of their interactions optimizing the irrigation amounts and the combined application strategies of organic and inorganic fertilizers weighs the relationships among growth photosynthesis yield and quality this study estimated that pca is the best judgment method for grape quality therefore pca is adopted to evaluate the optimal irrigation amount and the ratios of organic fertilizer to inorganic fertilizer for seedless white grapes in extremely arid regions according to pca w3f2 processing ranked first therefore the combination of w3 irrigation volume 720 mm and f2 fertilization ratio organic fertilizer 50 inorganic fertilizer 50 is the optimal strategy for irrigation volume and organic inorganic fertilizer management for seedless white grapes table 8 5 conclusions based on two consecutive years of field tests in this study combining organic and inorganic fertilizers can significantly increase the contents of soil s available nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium total irrigation amounts w3 720 mm and w4 765 mm same fertilizer level significantly improved grape growth photosynthesis yield and fruit quality except for fruit morphology index additionally applying 50 of 50 cf f2 significantly enhanced growth photosynthesis yield and quality except titratable acid and fruit shape index in this study the combinational evaluation method cem was utilized to evaluate the four methods pca topsis gra and sfv evaluation methods and analyze the fruit quality the results showed that the w4f2 765 mm organic fertilizer 50 inorganic fertilizer 50 treatment was the best for the quality of the grapes in the end principal component analysis pca was applied to analyze the yield and fruit quality of the two year experiment and the results suggested that the treatment effects of 720 mm optimal organic fertilizer 50 inorganic fertilizer 50 n 150 kg ha p2o5 150 kg ha kcl 300 kg ha were the most effective given the above this study hopes to provide a scientific reference for optimizing irrigation and nitrogen fertilizer management strategy for enhancing the grapes growth photosynthesis yield and fruit quality in similar arid regions declaration

values for the dense canopy stage were 0 78 0 77 445 6 s m 1 and 0 97 respectively segmented ja models based on the leaf area index threshold significantly improved the accuracy of rc estimation where the median r2 and nse were improved by 7 1 and 12 4 in the partial canopy stage and by 12 2 and 13 4 in the dense canopy stage despite pointing out the best environmental constraint functions of the ja model in the different growth stages results indicated that the mea yielded the most accurate estimates of rc followed by qpso ga and lsm moreover the ja model with environmental constraints was the most accurate method to estimate the apple tree tsf and mea was the most suitable parameter optimization algorithm overall the findings of this study provide accurate actual water consumption

introduction china accounts for 49 of the world s apple production 87 24 106 t faostat food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2019 and it is the largest producer and the loess plateau is a major apple producing region in china nbsprc national bureau of statistics of the people s republic of china 2021 as it provides the best environmental conditions for apple growth however apple production is often limited by drought and water shortages it is necessary for formulating feasible water saving management strategies to improve water efficiency and economic benefits most i e 99 of the water resources in the global cropland systems are consumed through evapotranspiration et wang et al 2020 so accurate et modeling especially the productive plant transpiration t component is essential to realize the efficient use of regional water resources and to ensure a stable and a high yielding production of apples in this region as a core parameter of t the surface canopy resistance rc is difficult to measure but numerous studies have indicated that combining it with the penman monteith model pm can provide accurate estimates of t chen et al 2020 li et al 2016 shan et al 2019 srivastava et al 2018 although mathematical models comprising simplified descriptions of real systems are usually not comprehensive it is still acceptable to explore alternative models for concisely estimating rc with reasonable precision and high stability using readily accessible variables based on the assumption that the effects of environmental stresses on rc are independent of each other jarvis 1997 proposed a widely used rc model of multiplying a series of independent environmental constraint functions which reflects the stress of environmental variables on rc many studies have applied different model configurations to improve the accuracy of jarvis ja models for estimating the et or t component whitley et al 2008 used a modified jarvis stewart model stewart 1988 to calculate the t in an australian native forest and they suggested that it could be used to estimate annual patterns of stand transpiration eucalyptus crebra and callitris glaucophylla using daily environmental variables i e radiation temperature and vapor pressure deficit srivastava et al 2018 built a pm model based on the surface resistance rs and aerodynamic resistance ra and this method obtained highly accurate daily crop et estimates r2 0 78 however the estimation accuracy of transpiration obtained by jarvis models differed considerably between various model configurations guyot et al 2017 the discrepancies in the accuracy of ja type models for t estimation are mainly due to model structural uncertainty caused by combining different environmental constraint functions wang et al 2020 improved the ja model by modifying the radiation function for nocturnal sap flow simulations and the results showed that the modified ja model was able to capture the nocturnal sap flow li et al 2015 developed a coupled surface resistance model to calculate et by combining the transpiration restriction effect of vegetation and soil layers and the result showed that the coupled model significantly improved r2 and rmse by 1 2 57 2 and 4 7 45 8 compared with the modified shuttleworth wallace model zhou et al 2019 incorporated the relationship between the soil mineral nitrogen content and rc into the modified ja model and found that the rmse of the model reduced by 13 0 83 6 when estimating tomato t under different n application levels a more complex mathematical model structure may explain more of the mechanisms involved in a process of real systems but the increased number of parameters that need to be calibrated could also lead to overfitting therefore it is widely considered that an effective method for significantly improving the accuracy of et estimations involves recalibrating the parameters in ja models chen et al 2020 calibrated the parameters for various ja submodels using the bayesian markov chain monte carlo method and their results showed that the daily jujube t was estimated well with the value of r2 was 0 80 bai et al 2019 evaluated the performance of the ja model for t estimation combined with shuttleworth wallace s w when parameterized based on monte carlo simulations and the results showed that the method provided more reasonable parameterizations for spring maize t simulations with the value of r2 and rmse were 0 91 and 0 68 mm d 1 liu et al 2020 recalibrated the parameters in the ja model by using the nonlinear least squares method lsm to improve the accuracy of rice et estimations and they found that the pm model with the adjusted rc performed better than the s w model and the mean rmse values of pm were 0 043 0 053 and 0 046 mm h 1 at the early middle and late growth stage studies have concluded that optimized mathematical models are more accurate when compared with the original versions e g ahmadi et al 2021 and chia et al 2021 but the accuracies of various parameter optimization methods differ significantly the recent boom in artificial intelligence algorithms has advanced studies in agriculture and hydrology abd elmaboud et al 2021 alizadeh et al 2021 but the possible application of swarm intelligence optimization algorithms to empirical parameter optimization in mathematical models requires more attention bohaienko et al 2021 used the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm to identify the parameters in a water transport model and they demonstrated that using the optimized parameters significantly improved the accuracy of simulations by up to 19 the quantum pso qpso algorithm and mind evolutionary algorithm mea have been applied successfully in many studies luo et al 2018 wang et al 2018 but few have investigated the optimization of the empirical parameters especially for rc models as mentioned applying these swarm intelligence optimization algorithms for rc models is of great significance however the optimal parameters which can obtain accurate estimates of rc may vary temporally and spatially according to the conditions in the external environment and plant physiology yu et al 2017 applied the ja model in a summer maize field during four different growth stages and found that linear fitting of the empirical parameters with the divided growth period could obtain more accurate estimates of the maize rc jiang et al 2016 developed an et model based on canopy resistance in an arid region of northwest china and determined that obtaining the effective resistance by aggregating the plant and soil resistances weighted by the leaf area index lai was more suitable for estimating water use in maize with r2 mean absolute error mae and rmse of 0 76 69 2 s m 1 and 85 6 s m 1 in 2013 respectively and 0 78 56 1 s m 1 and 96 4 s m 1 in 2014 respectively li et al 2016 applied the ja model fitted by the segmented method according to different lai thresholds for estimating maize rc in an arid area of china and showed that the ja model fitted by the segmented method with an lai threshold value of 0 5 m2 m 2 could significantly improve the accuracy of maize et estimates with the improvement values of r2 and rmse were 0 83 and 0 77 mm d 1 respectively when integrated with the pm model the concern is justified regarding the influence of structure selection environmental constraint function of ja model parameter optimization empirical parameter in ja model and growth period segmentation according to lai on the accuracy of ja models but this problem has rarely been systematically studied moreover several studies have aimed to improve the accuracy of the estimates obtained with agricultural and hydraulic models by using swarm intelligence optimization algorithms but applications to ja models are rare remarkably the genetic algorithm ga qpso and mea have not been evaluated for parameter optimization in apple tree rc models based on the rain fed field experiments in apple trees conducted on the loess plateau of china during 2008 2010 our objectives were to 1 use the reversed pm model to calculate the surface canopy resistance rc of the apple trees and determine its daily variations based on meteorological vegetation and soil factors 2 explore the importance of environmental constraint function forms of ja submodels for estimating rc in different growth stages and achieved the optimal segmented ja model according to lai 3 compare the accuracy when using the ga qpso and mea algorithm for parameter optimization in the ja model and attained the optimal empirical parameters in the optimal segmented ja model and 4 compare the accuracy of the calibrated optimal segmented ja models with other rc models which integrated with the pm model for transpiration t estimation using the lai vapor pressure difference vpd net solar irradiance rn air temperature ta and soil water content θa during 2008 2010 thus we can obtain the most accurate t estimation model for precise irrigation management in apple trees on the loess plateau of china which was acceptable after being locally calibrated using accessible plant meteorological and soil water content data across a wide range of climates 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the experiment was conducted at the shiyanghe agricultural and ecological water saving experimental

which is controlled by the diversion flow and irrigation time takes place when the soil reaches the lower limits and terminates on the upper limits and the upper and lower limits of irrigation ranged between 65 and 100 field water capacity θfc liu et al 2012 2 2 data and measurement the net solar irradiance air relative humidity rh wind speed u2 and air temperature tmax tmin and ta were recorded

inter row space at 30 cm relative to the trees with an installation depth of 100 cm the soil water content at the vertical profile in each tube was measured at every 10 cm layer soil water content measured by tube tdr was calibrated by the oven drying method every month and the gravimetric was converted to volumetric water content values by multiplying the bulk density of the soil campbell and

taken on sunny days every 5 7 days and was analyzed by winscanopy 2006a software to obtain the lai of the apple tree then the lai was interpolated by the quadratic equation between lai and day of year

configurations produced with different formulae for environmental constraint functions yielded 81 ja submodels and these submodels can be separated into 12 sub groups according to the constraint functions used for environmental factors e g jar1 jar2 and jar3 denote that the first second and third form of radiant constraint function were used in the submodel respectively hence the ja type submodels differed in terms of their structural configurations and empirical parameters the abbreviations and configurations of the ja type submodels used in this study are presented in table 2 the model parameter estimation process involves searching for values that influence the accuracy by fitting independent observations thereby resulting in equifinality between the mathematical model and the real system taking rc pm as benchmark values this study calibrated these jarvis submodels using data during 2008 2009 and the data during 2010 was used to evaluate the optimized models 2 4 2

applied ga qpso and mea to calibrate the jarvis submodels and the flowcharts illustrating ga qpso and mea are shown in fig 2 2 5 1 genetic algorithm ga the ga was proposed by holland 1975 to find the optimal solution by simulating the biological evolution process the ga transforms the problem that needs to be solved into the evolution of a biological population where the search direction adaptively changes to search for the global optimal solution according to the probability theory method the ga has four basic operators selection crossover mutation and selection the algorithm has a good global search capacity and it can quickly search all solutions in the solution space without being trapped by a rapid descent into locally optimal solutions due to its inherent parallelism it is convenient to implement ga by distributed computing and speed up the solution search process for a mathematical description of the ga process see the study by garcia and lôndero 2021 2 5 2 quantum behaved particle swarm optimization qpso the pso is an optimization algorithm based on population foraging proposed by kennedy and eberhart 1995 and is essentially an improved ga algorithm that can achieve global optimization faster wu et al 2021 after generating an initial population the algorithm randomly initializes a group of particles in the feasible solution space each particle is a potential solution to the problem determined by the fitness function the direction of motion and distance of each particle in the multi dimensional search space is determined by its velocity and the velocity is affected by its inertia in each iteration the algorithm updates the velocity and position based on the personal extremum pbest and global extremum gbest li et al 2022 furthermore sun et al 2004 proposed the qpso algorithm characterized by a simple structure few parameters and fast convergence speed the qpso algorithm has been applied widely in various fields liu et al 2011 lu and he 2021 zhang et al 2021 by introducing delta square potential well centered on pbest into the pso algorithm the state of the particles is represented by a wave function ψ y 23 ψ y 1 l e p l l 1 β h 2 mr after solving using the monte carlo method the position evolution equation for the particle is obtained as follows 24 x p l 2 ln 1 u where l is the search radius of the particle which controls the search range and u is a random number between 0 1 in this study we introduce the average mbest for individual optimization to increase the convergence speed as follows 25 mbest 1 m i 1 m p i t 1 m i 1 m p i 1 t 1 m i 1 m p i 2 t 1 m i 1 m p i n t where the characteristic length l is 26 l i j t 2 α mbest x i j t the evolution formula for the particles then becomes 27 x i j t 1 p i j t 2 α mbest x i j t ln 1 u i j t where p i j t is the square potential well center of the ith particle in the jth dimension α is the contraction expansion factor i e α t t t is the current evolutionary algebra and t is the terminating evolutionary algebra 2 5 3 mind evolutionary algorithm mea the mea simulates the evolutionary process of human thinking through convergence and divergence processes which overcome the shortcomings of ga but also integrate the advantages of ga and evolutionary strategy wang et al 2018 the process followed to obtain the winning individual with a higher score through a competitive relationship in the subgroup is called convergence in all solution spaces if a subpopulation has a score that is less than that of the temporary subgroup in the superior subgroup the temporary subgroup with a larger score will replace the superior subgroup otherwise the temporary subgroup will be abandoned this process is called divergence the mathematical description of the mea process is as follows suppose that the population size in the mea is n the subpopulation size is m and the evaluation function is f then we can get 28 x m x 1 x 2 x m x i x i 1 2 m define a random mapping relationship s n x m 1 as 29 s n x σ x 0 x x 1 x 2 x m which indicates that a subgroup consisting of m new individuals is randomly generated from the normal distribution n x σ and parent individual with a given individual x x as the center define a random mapping relationship t x m 1 x such that 30 t x 0 x x 1 x 2 x m x t which indicates the winning individual is selected from m new individuals and parent individuals therefore the convergence process can be expressed as 31 s s n t x ω x define a random mapping relationship s o x n x n such that 32 s o x 1 x 2 x n x 1 x 2 x 3 x n where f x 1 f x 2 f x n indicates that the population is reordered according to the fitness function value define a random mapping relationship s u x n x n 1 such that 33 s u x 1 x 2 x n l x 1 x 2 x n l which indicates the individual in the subgroup with the worst fitness value define a random mapping relationship a d x n 1 x n such that 34 a d x 1 x 2 x n l l x 1 x 2 x l x l 1 x n which indicates that l new individuals are randomly selected in the solution space to replace the eliminated population therefore the divergence process can be expressed as 35 d s o s u a d x n x n the iterative population evolution process through convergence and divergence can be expressed as follows 36 x 1 k 1 x 2 k 1 x n k 1 s d x 1 k x 2 k x n k suppose that the population at time k is 37 p k x 1 k x 2 k x n k where x i k i 1 2 n is the winning individual in the ith subgroup and the fitness function is f i k f x i k mea retains the optimal solution in the operation process so if we suppose that the individual c k is the optimal solution obtained at time k then we have 38 f x k m i n 0 s k 1 i n f x i x suppose that the global optimal solution of the problem is x then we have 39 f f x m i n k f x k finally the population evolution process in mea can be described as the following sequence 40 f k f 0 f 1 f 2 f k where k is a positive integer representing the evolutionary algebra 2 6 water stress coefficient when the potential energy of the soil water drops below a threshold value the crop is said to be water stressed the effects of soil water stress are described by multiplying the basal crop coefficient by the water stress coefficient ks this study proposed the jensen method jensen et al 1970 which believes that the ks is logarithmic to the relative effective water content as follows 41 k s ln θ a θ w p θ f c θ w p 1 ln 101 where ks represents the water stress coefficient ks 1 for soil water limiting conditions and ks 1 when there is no soil water stress θfc θwp and θa are the field water capacity the wilting coefficient and the average soil water content respectively 2 7 path analysis path analysis is an extension of regression analysis li 1991 and it can decompose the interactions correlation coefficients between causal variables into direct effects direct path coefficients and indirect effects indirect path coefficients to study the data structure of causality this study analyzed the direct and indirect importance of independent variables for dependent variables for a correlative system with one dependent variable y and numerous independent variables xi i 1 2 n the multiple linear equations are expressed as follows 42 y a 0 a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 a n x n where y represents the dependent variable xi represents the ith independent variable and ai represents the partial regression coefficient of the variable xi to y by substituting with the actual observed values the standard matrix equation can be established by solving the mathematical transformation of the equations using the lsm method 43 1 r x 1 x 2 r x i x n r x 2 x 1 1 r x 2 x n r x n x 1 r x n x 2 1 p x 1 y p x 2 y p x n y r x 1 y r x 2 y r x n y where r x i x j represents the correlation coefficient of variable xi and xj and p x i y is the direct path coefficient representing the direct effect of variable xi on y 44 p x i y a i σ x i σ y where σ xi and σ y represent the standard deviations of xi and y respectively and r x i x j p x i y is the indirect path coefficient representing the indirect effect of variable xi through variable xj to y the remaining variables represent the effects of other independent variables and errors on the dependent variable y where the p ey is calculated as follows 45 p ey 1 r x 1 y p x 1 y r x 2 y p x 2 y r x n y p x n y 2 8 model evaluation estimation accuracy indicators comprise the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and root mean square error rmse dong et al 2022 the ranking or comparison of many models with different statistical indicators is difficult thus global performance indicator gpi feng et al 2020 was used to comprehensively evaluate the estimation models these indicators are defined as follows 46 r 2 i 1 n y i y x i x i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n x i x 2 2 47 n s e 1 i 1 n y i x i 2 i 1 n x i x 2 48 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i x i 2 49 g p i j 1 m α j s i j s i m e d i a n where xi and yi are the ith benchmark values i e rc pm and tsf and estimated values i e rc est and tsf est respectively x and y represent the corresponding mean values high values of r2 and nse closer to 1 and lower values of rmse indicate good prediction accuracy of transpiration models sii is the normalized value of r2 nse or rmse simedian is the median of the corresponding parameter m is the number of statistical indicators and α j is equal to 1 for r2 and nse and equal to 1 for rmse 3 results 3 1 quantitative variations in effect factors and relationships with canopy resistance fig 3a c shows that the seasonal meteorological factors i e vpd rn and ta varied unimodally during the apple tree growth period with average daily values of 1 5 kpa 13 1 mj m 2 and 10 2 c respectively fig 3d shows that θa fluctuated significantly under the effects of irrigation rainfall and evapotranspiration with a range of 0 19 0 31 m3 m 3 furthermore the values of ks at wuwei in 2008 2010 were always equal to 1 00 according to eq 41 see table s1 as supplementary material for the value of ks during the growth period of 2008 2010 which illustrated that there is no soil water stress in the apple orchard of wuwei station as shown in fig 3e lai exhibited a highly significant logarithmic varying trend during the growth period r2 0 94 p 0 001 the lai increased rapidly to 1 9 m2 m 2 in 2008 2 0 m2 m 2 in 2009 and 2 2 m2 m 2 in 2010 in the earlier growth stage doy 99 179 in 2008 doy 99 210 in 2009 and doy 100 208 in 2010 and remained stable after lai reached a maximum value in the late growth stage doy 180 269 in 2008 doy 211 269 in 2009 and doy 209 274 in 2010 therefore the whole apple tree growth period was divided into the partial stage and dense canopy stage by doy 179 in 2008 doy 210 in 2009 and doy 208 in 2010 lai lai max as the threshold in this study the measured apple tree transpiration tsf fig 3f varies with a range of 1 1 6 0 mm d 1 during the whole growth period and the maximum tsf often occurred in mid june doy 183 238 the daily variation in the pm derived surface canopy resistance rc pm during the whole growth period and for three years is shown in fig 4 these results show that rc was highest at the beginning of the growth period with a value of 9900 s m 1 and it then decreased abruptly at a rate of 120 s m 1 d 1 as the lai environmental factors i e vpd rn and ta and transpiration increased fig 2 where the minimum value was around 1000 s m 1 from early april to mid june i e partial canopy stage subsequently rc decreased gradually at a rate of 27 s m 1 d 1 as the lai stabilized until late september i e dense canopy stage where the minimum value was around 150 s m 1 this gradual decrease in rc occurred regardless of the relatively substantial decreases in the levels of environmental factors and transpiration due to the intense daily fluctuations of rc during the growth period the effect of θa on transpiration was not obvious these results suggested that the seasonal variations in rc could be controlled by lai vpd rn ta and θa throughout the growth stages of the apple trees although the relationships appeared complicated and ambiguous the path analysis method was used in this study to systematically quantify the relationships between rc and meteorological soil and vegetation factors as shown in fig 5 path analysis explained 80 81 and 79 p 0 001 of the variations in rc during the partial canopy stage dense canopy stage and whole growth stage respectively where the effects of lai vpd rn ta and θa considered in this study explained the variability in rc at the shiyanghe experimental station significantly the effects of vegetation climatic and soil factors on the daily variations in rc differed among the growth stages table 4 table 4 showed that lai was the most critical factor and had the main negative total effect on rc followed by vpd rn ta and θa with total effect values of 0 78 0 32 0 35 0 31 and 0 09 in the partial canopy stage and 0 72 0 50 0 31 0 01 and 0 24 in the whole growth stage moreover lai was the critical indirect effect path for ta in the partial canopy stage with indirect effect values of 0 45 in the whole growth stage and 0 46 in the partial canopy stage in addition vpd was the main positive regulator of rc among the climatic factors with a total effect value of 0 90 and it was the critical indirect effect path for rn and ta in the dense canopy stage in terms of rn it had indirect positive effects through vpd with values of 0 47 in the partial canopy stage of 0 57 in the dense canopy stage respectively in terms of ta it had indirect positive effects through lai and vpd simultaneously with values of 0 46 and 0 55 in the partial canopy stage but vpd became the main indirect effect path for ta with values of 0 61 in the dense canopy stage overall lai had the main negative total effect in the partial canopy stage and vpd was the main positive total effect in the dense canopy stage most importantly the total effects of meteorological factors i e vpd rn and ta in the dense canopy stage were more significant than lai thereby demonstrating that rc was primarily driven by meteorological factors after the plant canopy structure stabilized θa had no significant effects on the apple tree rc total effects range 0 09 0 24 presumably because the soil water content was not limited to transpiration table 4 3 2 accuracy of jarvis models for estimating canopy resistance in different stages as shown in tables s3 5 the submodel ja3322 performed the best gpi rank first among

in fig 6 the accuracy of the estimates obtained by the 81 submodels varied significantly where the r2 values ranged among 0 26 0 71 in the whole stage 0 42 0 80 in the partial canopy stage and 0 27 0 82 in the dense canopy stage in addition the nse values had wide distributions with ranges of 0 29 0 65 0 04 0 72 and 0 12 0 77 in the whole partial and dense stages respectively similar results were obtained for the rmse values which ranged among 1252 99 2893 80 s m 1 1203 306 2987 31 s m 1 and 422 38 1491 89 s m 1 in the whole partial and dense stages respectively see table s2 as supplementary material for the value of empirical parameters of jarvis submodels in the different growth stages therefore our results indicate that the ja submodels were not always appropriate under various environmental constraint functions furthermore the variations in the accuracy of the estimates obtained by these submodels varied significantly among different apple tree growth stages the statistical indicators were considerably better in the partial or dense canopy stages compared with those in the whole growth stage fig 6 in the partial canopy stage the median r2 and nse values were improved by 7 1 and 12 4 respectively in the dense canopy stage the median r2 and nse values were improved by 12 2 and 13 4 respectively however the rmse was dimensional and not comparable among stages overall the segmented ja model built according to the lai threshold significantly improved the estimation accuracy for the apple tree rc 3 3 accuracy of constraint functions for estimating canopy resistance in this study differences in accuracy were found among the various environmental constraint functions for the jarvis type models as shown in fig 7 the accuracy of these 12 subgroups varied significantly for the constraint function of vpd jav3 performed better than jav1 and jav2 with median r2 nse and rmse values of 0 66 0 55 and 1322 97 s m 1 in the whole growth stage 0 76 0 67 and 1277 15 s m 1 in the partial canopy stage and 0 76 0 58 and 654 50 s m 1 in the dense canopy stage fig 7 showed the box plots of r2 nse and rmse obtained by jarvis type submodels composed of different environmental constraint functions as shown in fig 7 for the constraint functions of rn jar3 obtained estimates with the best accuracy compared with jar1 the r2 nse and rmse values of jar3 improved by 3 1 3 9 and 9 1 in the whole growth stage 14 4 13 5 and 17 7 in the partial canopy stage and 2 4 6 1 and 6 5 in the dense canopy stage respectively compared with jar2 the r2 nse and rmse values of jar3 improved by 10 5 7 7 and 18 1 in the whole growth stage 14 7 88 4 and 25 1 in the partial canopy stage and 3 4 1 2 and 7 8 in the dense canopy stage respectively however the best temperature constraint functions varied among the apple tree growth stages according to fig 7 jat1 jat1 and jat2 performed better in terms of accuracy in the whole partial and dense stages respectively compared with the other functions in the whole growth stage the r2 nse and rmse values of jat1 were improved by 3 9 11 0 and 6 7 and by 85 6 81 7 and 52 6 compared with jat2 and jat3 respectively in the partial canopy stage the r2 nse and rmse values of jat1 were improved by 10 4 10 7 and 13 6 and by 4 8 10 5 and 7 0 compared with jat2 and jat3 respectively in the dense canopy stage the r2 nse and rmse values of jat2 were improved by 1 1 17 1 and 2 5 and by 15 0 38 0 and 31 5 compared with jat1 and jat3 respectively similarly comparisons of the constraint functions for θa showed that the optimal function was not consistent in different growth stages according to fig 7 jaw1 jaw3 and jaw1 performed better in terms of accuracy in the whole partial and dense stages respectively compared with the other functions in the whole growth stage the r2 nse and rmse values of jaw1 were improved by 11 5 0 5 and 21 4 and by 17 1 19 0 and 23 2 compared with jaw2 and jaw3 respectively in the partial canopy stage the r2 nse and rmse values of jat3 were improved by 0 1 10 8 and 9 7 and by 7 6 10 6 and 11 2 compared with jat1 and jat2 respectively in the dense canopy stage the r2 nse and rmse values of jaw1 were improved by 0 8 15 5 and 5 7 and by 4 3 14 9 and 12 5 compared with jaw2 and jaw3 respectively overall the most accurate constraint function was consistent for vpd and rn whereas no unique function achieved the best accuracy for ta and θa in different apple tree growth stages in particular the best environmental constraint functions were v3 r3 t1 and w1 in the whole growth stage v3 r3 t1 and w3 in the partial canopy stage and v3 r3 t2 and w1 in the dense canopy stage respectively 3 4 accuracy of swarm intelligence algorithms for optimizing jarvis models the 81 ja type submodels were optimized using ga qpso and mea and compared with lsm as the original method i e ja model fig 8 displayed violin plots of r2 nse and rmse obtained by lsm ja ga ja qpso ja and mea ja during the whole partial and dense growth stages as shown in fig 8 the ranges of the accuracy improvements for the different enhanced ja type submodels i e ga ja qpso ja and mea ja varied significantly for ga ja the r2 nse and rmse values improved by 19 4 14 9 and 5 4 in the whole stage 8 0 8 0 and 6 6 in the partial canopy stage and 4 0 7 1 and 2 6 in the partial canopy stage respectively for qpso ja the r2 nse and rmse values improved by 22 6 18 9 and 10 3 in the whole stage 13 2 10 9 and 15 3 in the partial canopy stage and 6 5 12 6 and 5 9 in the partial canopy stage respectively for mea ja the r2 nse and rmse values improved by 28 2 38 9 and 24 8 in the whole stage respectively 18 8 24 5 and 28 2 in the partial canopy stage and 13 3 31 7 and 33 9 in the dense canopy stage respectively moreover comparisons of the accuracy of the swarm intelligence algorithms demonstrated that mea achieved the best performance with median r2 nse and rmse values of 0 79 0 73 and 1014 14 s m 1 in the whole stage 0 82 0 73 and 1096 189 s m 1 in the partial canopy stage and 0 82 0 76 and 432 53 s m 1 in the dense canopy stage respectively compared with ga ja mea ja improved the r2 nse and rmse values by 7 4 20 9 and 20 4 in the whole stage 10 1 15 3 and 23 1 in the partial canopy stage and 8 9 22 9 and 32 1 in the dense canopy stage respectively compared with qpso ja mea ja improved the r2 nse and rmse values by 4 5 16 9 and 16 1 in the whole stage 5 0 12 3 and 15 2 in the partial canopy stage and 6 4 16 9 and 29 7 in the dense canopy respectively comparisons of the accuracy of the optimization algorithms applied to ja3322 also demonstrated that mea ja3322 achieved the best performance based on gpi values gpi 1 00 at improving the ja model where the r2 nse and rmse values were 0 83 0 78 and 915 52 s m 1 in the whole stage 0 88 0 83 and 1003 65 s m 1 in the partial canopy stage and 0 93 0 87 and 311 51 s m 1 in the dense canopy stage respectively fig 9 compared with lsm ja the gpi value of ga ja and qpso ja mea ja were improved by 144 9 184 3 and 200 0 in the whole growth stage 89 0 141 2 and 200 0 in the partial canopy stage and 130 6 151 5 and 200 0 in the dense canopy stage respectively overall mea obtained the best accuracy at optimizing empirical parameters in ja submodels for estimating the apple tree rc followed by qpso ga and lsm according to fig 9 rc pm was overestimated at low values but underestimated at high values moreover the plots versus measured transpiration values matched best along the 1 1 line for the mea ja3322 model but with some widely distributed outlier points at the high value region around the regression line especially in the whole and partial canopy stages 3 5 accuracy of jarvis models integrated with pm for estimating transpiration different configurations of the rc model led to various forms of rc based pm equations the evaluation results obtained for the rc based pm equations when estimating apple tree transpiration indicated that there were clear differences in accuracy between different rc based pm equations fig 10 as shown in fig 10 the comprehensive accuracies gpi of the models were ranked as follows in the whole growth stage pmmea ja3322 pmqpso ja3322 pmga ja3322 pm lsm ja3322 pmkl pmfa pmst pmsg pmma the gpi values for the models were ranked as follows in the partial canopy stage pmmea ja3322 pmqpso ja3322 pmga ja3322 pm lsm ja3322 pmkl pmst pmfa pmsg pmma the gpi values for the models were ranked as follows in the dense canopy stage pmmea ja3322 pmqpso ja3322 pmga ja3322 pm lsm ja3322 pmkl pmst pmfa pmsg pmma respectively therefore ja models performed better than kl fa st sg and ma at estimating transpiration when integrated with pm fig 10 shows scatter plots of the measured versus estimated apple tree transpiration values obtained by rc models integrated with the pm equation according to fig 10 the plots versus measured transpiration values matched well along the 1 1 line for the pmja3322 model but with some widely distributed outlier points around the regression line furthermore the swarm intelligence optimization algorithms i e ga qpso and mea significantly improved the apple tree transpiration simulation accuracy for the rc based pm model as expected pmmea ja3322 obtained the best performance based on gpi with r2 nse rmse and gpi values of 0 81 0 76 0 69 mm d 1 and 1 00 in the whole growth stage 0 92 0 84 0 63 mm d 1 and 1 00 in the partial canopy stage and 0 93 0 86 0 42 mm d 1 and 1 00 in the dense canopy stage respectively fig 10 similarly as shown in fig 10 pmga ja3322 and pmqpso ja3322 were more accurate than the pmlsm ja3322 model where the corresponding gpi values were improved by 246 7 and 421 9 in the whole growth stage 68 2 and 74 7 in the partial canopy stage and 391 7 and 638 3 in the dense canopy stage compared to the value of pm lsm ja3322 respectively in addition the degree of dispersion for the data points in the scatter plot for pmmea ja3322 was substantially lower than for those in the plots for pmga ja3322 and pmqpso ja3322 fig 10 thereby demonstrating the high potential of using the mea for calibrating the empirical parameters in the ja model overall ja was the most accurate empirical rc model at estimating the transpiration of the apple tree when integrated with pm and mea was the most suitable parameter optimization method for the rc based pm model on the loess plateau 4 discussion 4 1 mechanism analysis for the relationships between canopy resistance and the factors which affect it it is generally considered that stomata have evolved to provide a means for controlling water loss from plants while allowing photosynthesis jones 1998 mechanisms involved in the stomatal response to environmental conditions are multiple and have different quantitative effects on stomatal resistance stomatal resistance varies within a leaf between leaves in a canopy and between layers different researchers have studied the relationship between canopy resistance and its effect factors to help understand meteorological vegetation and soil water control on tree water use despite the structural and morphological changes in the lai which affect the relationships between the stomatal morphology and environmental factors lai has been used to derive canopy resistance from stomatal resistance as shown in other studies irmak et al 2008 lindroth 1985 zhang et al 2016 and its effect was relatively high at incomplete lai zhao et al 2020 this conclusion was consistent with the result of this study that lai was the most critical factor and had the main negative total effect on rc in the partial canopy stage r 0 78 p 0 001 as shown in table 3 furthermore this study found that vpd played a positive predominant role in the whole growth stage with the value of direct effect being 0 65 p 0 001 in the partial stage and 0 71 p 0 001 in the dense stage table 3 similarly landsberg and butler 1980 also concluded that stomatal resistance increased with the increase in vpd it is presumably because stomata close when the difference between the vapor pressures of the leaf and atmosphere vpd increases to prevent excessive loss of leaf moisture merilo et al 2018 as the primary energy source of humidity and temperature this study found that vpd and ta were the main effect paths from rn to rc consistently gowdy et al 2022 also concluded that canopy conductance varies diurnally in negative response to changes in rn average air temperature ta is of great significance to plant growth and development and strong correlations with the lai are found for the mean daily air temperatures hardwick et al 2015 moreover vpd increases with temperature because molecular speeds are higher as temperature increases lamb and shaw 2016 all these physical and physiological mechanisms explain that ta has an indirect effect through lai and vpd in the partial and dense growth stages respectively conventional wisdom has it that water stress in mature leaves may be a major factor in stomatal closure to reduce water loss with the increase of canopy resistance daszkowska golec and szarejko 2013 however this study found that θa did not significantly affect the rc of apple trees presumably because adequate water management led to no water stress in the study area ks 1 according to chen et al 2020 who further concluded that θa would not significantly affect rc when the soil moisture was sufficient 20 thus there is no significant soil drought at the apple orchard for the test and the atmospheric demand is the most significant factor affecting canopy resistance when irrigation is appropriate 4 2 reasons for accuracy differences of jarvis models at different growth stages despite the significant nonlinearity and temporality of rc this study found that meteorological soil and vegetation factors i e lai vpd rn ta and θa could explain most of the variation 79 81 in the apple tree rc during the growth period according to path analysis fig 5 thus the differences in the accuracy of the estimates obtained by the rc models among different apple tree growth stages were also strongly associated with seasonal variations in these factors consistent with the results of this study chen et al 2020 also concluded that plants generally experience and acclimatize to various biotic and abiotic stresses during development thereby leading to changes in parameter values between the growth stages that are crucial for long term modeling li et al 2015 used an lai value of 2 0 m2 m 2 as the threshold for the partial and dense canopy to compare surface resistance models for estimating et and they also showed that the coupled surface resistance model significantly improved the accuracy and reliability of the pm model li et al 2016 estimated rc for maize using the ja model in the arid region of northwest china and found that a high rn in may could have resulted in a less accurate estimate of rc and caused the et estimation error thus rc modeling with consistent empirical parameters throughout the whole plant growth stage would lead to incorrect estimates for the real system furthermore we found dramatic changes in the main factor that affected the apple tree rc according to different lai thresholds according to figure 9 rc was overestimated at low values but underestimated at high values using ja models different from li et al 2015 this study obtained rc from tsf using inversed pm to avoid the indivisible problem between surface canopy resistance rc and surface soil resistance rs and thus the estimation result of ja models didn t affect by the thoughtless of rs garcia santos et al 2009 irmak and mutiibwa 2010 shuttleworth and gurney 1990 in response to the above statement as shown in fig 9 this study found no significant difference in the estimation accuracy of rc using ja models between partial and dense canopy stages which was contrary to the conclusion drawn by li et al 2015 that the ja models were not reliable under the low lai condition but performed well when canopy fully covered the underlying surface the reason that can explain the misestimation of rc using ja models in this study may be these parameter calibration methods searched the optimal empirical parameters according to the global optimal strategy and sacrificed the estimation accuracy in the region of the extreme values he and qin 2021 ribeiro and moniz 2020 furthermore the statistical indicators improved considerably for the partial or dense canopy stage compared with those in the whole growth stage thereby indicating that effective accuracy improvements were obtained when the ja model was segmented according to lai thresholds similarly li et al 2016 concluded that fitting the ja model by segmenting according to an lai threshold value of 0 5 m2 m 2 significantly improved the estimation of the maize et when integrated with the pm model other studies have also shown that the pm model integrated with segmented rc models obtained better estimates after setting lai 1 0 m2 m 2 when the soil surface was completely covered dolman 1993 these studies suggested that rc is mainly controlled by the vegetation meteorological and soil effect factors in summary the pm model integrated with segmented ja models according to lai thresholds could improve the accuracy of estimates of the apple tree rc and transpiration 4 3 reasons for accuracy differences of the jarvis models composed of different environmental constraint functions in this study the accuracy varied significantly when the configuration of the ja type model was changed fig 6 the multiplicative ja type model has been applied widely for rc estimation and incorporated into the pm model for estimating transpiration since the ja model was proposed by jarvis 1997 various environmental constraint functions have been designed as well as different formulae table 1 wang et al 2014 also concluded that the selection of constraint functions is very important for canopy conductance modeling zhou et al 2019 incorporated the constraint function for the soil mineral nitrogen content into the modified ja type rc model and found that the model improved the accuracy of the pm estimation under different nitrogen application levels in general environmental constraint functions were selected arbitrarily in many previous studies to construct the ja model and various submodels were derived without specific consideration although this study found significant differences in accuracy among the various environmental constraint functions for ja type model the optimum constraint function of vpd and rn was always consistent at different growth stages however the optimum constraint function of ta and θa was different as the growth period changed this conclusion was consistent with the result of path analysis between rc and other environmental factors we found the effect path of vpd and rn were unchanged but the effect path of ta changed from lai and vpd in the partial stage to vpd in the dense stage since the mapping relationship between rc and ta differed significantly with the advance of the growth period the expression of their relationship has changed similar to our results chen et al 2020 found the differences in the constraint functions for ta vpd and rn by using the markov chain monte carlo method to compare the estimation accuracy of various ja type submodels in estimating the daily transpiration by rain fed jujube in terms of θa we found its effect on rc was insignificant which result in the difference in the optimum constraint function of θa in the different growth stages presumably because adequate water management leads to no water stress in the study area ks 1 which has been proved by samanta et al 2008 specifically this study found that the submodel ja3322 obtained the most accurate tsf estimates presumably because of the advantage in its environmental constraint functions over others functional expression of v1 r1 t1 and w1 were exponential functions in which the exponential function curve shows an increasing trend and the slope gradually increases that is a small change on the x axis can lead to a large change on the y axis miao et al 2017 it is common knowledge that the canopy resistance is very sensitive to environmental features chen et al 2020 gassmann et al 2019 hoshika et al 2017 thus the exponential growth of rc along with the environmental changes was unsound which has been proved by fig 7 moreover although we have calibrated these empirical parameters using three swarm intelligence optimization algorithms the constants in r2 t1 t3 w1 and w3 were unchanged according to the recommended or measured values which induced much uncertainty in ja submodels in the mathematical formula of r2 we accepted the recommended value of 1100 to compute the restrictive effect of net radiation although the value has no practical physical significance chen et al 2020 regarding t1 and t3 the optimum plant temperature topt of the apple trees in the mathematical formulas was defined as the temperature at which the transpiration rate reaches the maximum wang et al 2014 according to liu 2012 the topt value of apple trees red marshal in this study was 25 however was not optimally calibrated although lots of research achieved the topt value based on the field measurement method bai et al 2019 wang et al 2014 harris et al 2004 and li et al 2015 considered topt as an empirical parameter derived by multi variate optimization methods and the results showed better accuracy in rc estimations in future work we attempt to verify whether the optimized topt would improve the estimated accuracy in rc and tsf of apple trees the similar conclusion can be gained from the poor performance of w1 and w3 that the θwp and θfc in these constraint functions of soil water content were measured by field methods colman 1947 comparing v2 with v3 the inverse function v3 has a significant advantage over the linear function v2 because the relationship between vpd and tsf wasn t linear smith 2020 and the geometric characteristics of the inverse proportional function has proved more suitable to describe the environmental restrictions of vpd on rc as showed in fig 7 4 4 reasons for accuracy differences of the optimized jarvis models using different swarm intelligence algorithms modeling approaches provide solutions according to simplified or approximated processes for estimating rc so significant differences may occur with the ja model in realistic situations presumably because of numerous assumptions and approximations sarker and newton 2007 these differences may decrease when using complex models containing more mechanistic processes and more parameters using many empirical parameters generally leads to greater adaptability and the models may be closer to real systems but parameter acquisition can also be more difficult moreover problems such as parameter correlation non uniqueness ill posedness and parameter equivalence will lead to the generation of non unique parameter estimation results with traditional methods such as the lsm birdi et al 2021 nonlinear fitting method tang et al 2021 and trial and error approach bugajny and furmańczyk 2022 but it is impossible to prove whether the ja type rc models have used a local optimal value or if they have been optimized using an inappropriate method swarm intelligence algorithms are effective for estimating unique globally optimal parameters in mathematical models in the present study the swarm intelligence algorithms performed significantly better than the traditional methods at calculating the empirical parameters for the ja type models similarly wang et al 2009 compared three representative optimization methods for hydrologic parameter optimization which they applied to automatic parameter calibration for the xinanjiang model and they found that ga could globally coherently and rapidly converge to the optimal solutions and achieve satisfactory results however the improved pso algorithm qpso performed better than ga in the present study which is not in agreement with the results reported by li et al 2022 xi et al 2015 suggested that models calibrated with the qpso operated satisfactorily in calibrating rzwqm2 root zone water quality model 2 parameters based on single and multiple objective functions because which was attributed to its advantages of simple algorithm structure faster convergence speed and better convergence performance among the swarm intelligence algorithms applied in this study we found that the mea was most accurate at optimizing the empirical parameters in the ja model because of its specific characteristics mea combines the advantages of ga and evolutionary strategies and it also overcomes their shortcomings by transforming single layer population evolution into multi layer population evolution through its unique convergence and divergence processes to improve the global search efficiency of the algorithm in summary the swarm intelligence algorithms were more effective at parameter optimization compared with the traditional methods and mea was most suitable for optimizing the parameters in apple tree rc models 4 5 reasons for accuracy differences of transpiration estimation using different empirical canopy resistance models in this study as shown in fig 10 the path analysis method elaborated that lai vpd rn t and θa can explain most of the variations in rc 80 81 and 79 at the whole partial and dense canopy growth stage thus how to consider the coupling effect of meteorological physiological and soil water content on rc process is critical for simulating tsf results indicate that the ja models combined with pm achieved better performance against the other empirical canopy resistance models for estimating tsf fig 10 presumably because ja has considered the full effect of meteorological physiological and soil factors on rc for estimating tsf simultaneously li et al 2015 zhou et al 2019 however kl fa st sg and ma did not inadequately consider the effect factors on rc as shown in eq 18 22 kl and st were composed of lai rn and vpd as independent variables while sg merely considered lai and rn regarding fa and ma the effect of lai on rc was neglected which echoed their poor performance in estimating tsf furthermore this study found no significant difference in the estimation accuracy of rc using these empirical models between partial and dense canopy stages fig 10 which disagreed with li et al 2015 who concluded that these empirical rc models did not consider the contribution of the soil layer on evaporation and can t estimate the surface resistance thus these models are not suitable for the condition of partial canopy stage in another research proposed by matheny et al 2014 they indicated that the majority of land surface models have difficulty in resolving the dynamics of et for errors in calculating surface resistance especially in water stress conditions however this study found no significant difference in the estimation accuracy of rc between partial and dense canopy stage primarily because this study only deals with the estimation of rc and tsf at an area without soil water stress in a word this study used these empirical rc models to estimate the tsf integrated with pm was appropriate at both partial and dense canopy stages of apple trees on the loess plateau 5 summary and conclusions based on exploring the influence of growth stage segmentation model configuration selection and empirical parameter optimization on the estimation accuracy of the jarvis submodel for apple tree surface canopy resistance we compared the optimal jarvis model with other canopy resistance models integrated with penman monteith for transpiration estimation using leaf area index vapor pressure difference net solar irradiance air temperature and soil water content of apple orchard during 2008 2010 at wuwei city on the loess plateau of china the main findings of this study were canopy resistance decreased abruptly in the partial canopy stage and subsequently decreased gradually in the dense canopy stage lai and vpd were the main positive regulator in the partial and dense canopy stage respectively segmenting the jarvis models according to the lai can significantly improve the accuracy of the canopy resistance estimates ja3322 achieved the most accurate canopy resistance estimates and mea was the optimal algorithm for jarvis models generally the best environmental constraint functions were v3 r3 t2 and w1 in the whole growth stage v3 r3 t1 and w3 in the partial canopy stage and v3 r3 t2 and w1 in the dense canopy stage most of all the mea ja3322 model was the most accurate empirical canopy resistance model combined with the penman monteith model for estimating apple tree transpiration after local optimized by the mea algorithm using the historical lai vpd rn ta and θa the submodel ja3322 segmented according to lai can be proposed to estimate transpiration in different climates when integrated with the penman monteith model our findings reveal the response mechanism of apple tree stomata to environmental factors and prove that the model structure growth period segmented and model optimization have a significant impact on the accuracy of the jarvis model for estimating surface canopy resistance and the estimation accuracy of apple tree transpiration is improved through the coupling of optimal jarvis and penman monteith model as the productive component of evapotranspiration transpiration is difficult to directly measure by ordinary orchard managers in the traditional sense based on the findings drawn by this study the orchard managers can obtain the actual water consumption of apple trees accurately using lai vpd rn ta and θa furthermore the accurate estimated transpiration combined with accessible evaporation can be further proposed to develop the apple orchard irrigation plan for the orchard manager moreover orchard managers also can develop reasonable transpiration control strategies to maintain acceptable productivity and ensure the sustainability of orchard water resources management in this generally fragile ecological environment above all the finding of this study provides the most accurate actual water consumption information of apple trees using easily accessible meteorological soil and tree data for the effective day to day water management decision making of rain fed apple tree orchards on the loess plateau given space limitations this study can t fully explore the influence of lai threshold selection on surface canopy resistance modeling although researchers have begun to study the importance of lai threshold selection in addition this paper only researched the coupling of the canopy resistance model and single source evapotranspiration model i e penman monteith while the popular dual source model e g shuttleworth wallace in the field is not involved which is also the main shortcoming and research directions of our research moreover we also attempt to study other environmental constraint function forms and apply additional variables such as tree height stem diameter leaf water potential leaf temperature carbon dioxide soil nutrient or wind speed in the future since the result of the path analysis showed that the variables selected in this study cannot fully explain the variations in canopy resistance of apple tree last but not least although this study proposed a successful canopy resistance and transpiration modeling pathway including model structure

9168,accurate estimates of plant transpiration tsf are essential to maximizing the efficient use of water when only considering the surface canopy resistance rc the penman monteith pm model is commonly used in tsf modeling however the rc is difficult to measure but it can be accurately estimated using the jarvis canopy resistance model ja our objectives were to evaluate the rc of apple trees calculated with an inverted pm model integrated with different versions of the ja model for different growth stages and to compare their accuracy using four optimization algorithms the least squares method lsm genetic algorithm ga quantum particle swarm optimization qpso and the mind evolutionary algorithm mea we explored the effect of environmental constraint functions and parameter optimization of three environmental variables vapor pressure deficit vpd net irradiance rn and air temperature ta and of soil water content θa on the accuracy of ja sub models to calculate apple tree rc and tsf in our analysis we used rainfed data from experiments on an apple orchard conducted during 2008 2010 at wuwei city on the loess plateau of china we compared 81 segmented ja sub models by canopy growth stage comprising of the combination of the environmental constraint functions that were used to calculate rc moreover the ja sub models were optimized and results were compared to improve the accuracy of tsf estimates with five empirical rc models combined with the pm model the results showed that sub model ja3322 i e the third constraint for vpd the third constraint for rn the second constraint for ta and the second constraint for θa attained the best estimate of rc with a coefficient of determination r2 0 71 a nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse 0 65 root mean squared error rmse 1257 4 s m 1 and global performance indicator gpi 1 0 for the whole growth stage the equivalent values for the partial canopy stage were 0 78 0 72 1203 3 s m 1 and 0 99 and the values for the dense canopy stage were 0 78 0 77 445 6 s m 1 and 0 97 respectively segmented ja models based on the leaf area index threshold significantly improved the accuracy of rc estimation where the median r2 and nse were improved by 7 1 and 12 4 in the partial canopy stage and by 12 2 and 13 4 in the dense canopy stage despite pointing out the best environmental constraint functions of the ja model in the different growth stages results indicated that the mea yielded the most accurate estimates of rc followed by qpso ga and lsm moreover the ja model with environmental constraints was

introduction china accounts for 49 of the world s apple production 87 24 106 t faostat food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2019 and it is the largest producer and the loess plateau is a major apple producing region in china nbsprc national bureau of statistics of the people s republic of china 2021 as it provides the best environmental conditions for apple growth however apple production is often limited by drought and water shortages it is necessary for formulating feasible water saving management strategies to improve water efficiency and economic benefits most i e 99 of the water resources in the global cropland systems are consumed through evapotranspiration et wang et al 2020 so accurate et modeling especially the productive plant transpiration t component is essential to realize the efficient use of regional water resources and to ensure a stable and a high yielding production of apples in this region as a core parameter of t the surface canopy resistance rc is difficult to measure but numerous studies have indicated that combining it with the penman monteith model pm can provide accurate estimates of t chen et al 2020 li et al 2016 shan et al 2019 srivastava et al 2018 although mathematical models comprising simplified descriptions of real systems are usually not comprehensive it is still acceptable to explore alternative models for concisely estimating rc with reasonable precision and high stability using readily accessible variables based on the assumption that the effects of environmental stresses on rc are independent of each other jarvis 1997 proposed a widely used rc model of multiplying a series of independent environmental constraint functions which reflects the stress of environmental variables on rc many studies have applied different model configurations to improve the accuracy of jarvis ja models for estimating the et or t component whitley et al 2008 used a modified jarvis stewart model stewart 1988 to calculate the t in an australian native forest and they suggested that it could be used to estimate annual patterns of stand transpiration eucalyptus crebra and callitris glaucophylla using daily environmental variables i e radiation temperature and vapor pressure deficit srivastava et al 2018 built a pm model based on the surface resistance rs and aerodynamic resistance ra and this method obtained highly accurate daily crop et estimates r2 0 78 however the estimation accuracy of transpiration obtained by jarvis models differed considerably between various model configurations guyot et al 2017 the discrepancies in the accuracy of ja type models for t estimation are mainly due to model structural uncertainty caused by combining different environmental constraint functions wang et al 2020 improved the ja model by modifying the radiation function for nocturnal sap flow simulations and the results showed that the modified ja model was able to capture the nocturnal sap flow li et al 2015 developed a coupled surface resistance model to calculate et by combining the transpiration restriction effect of vegetation and soil layers and the result showed that the coupled model significantly improved r2 and rmse by 1 2 57 2 and 4 7 45 8 compared with the modified shuttleworth wallace model zhou et al 2019 incorporated the relationship between the soil mineral nitrogen content and rc into the modified ja model and found that the rmse of the model reduced by 13 0 83 6 when estimating tomato t under different n application levels a more complex mathematical model structure may explain more of the mechanisms involved in a process of real systems but the increased number of parameters that need to be calibrated could also lead to overfitting therefore it is widely considered that an effective method for significantly improving the accuracy of et estimations involves recalibrating the parameters in ja models chen et al 2020 calibrated the parameters for various ja submodels using the bayesian markov chain monte carlo method and their results showed that the daily jujube t was estimated well with the value of r2 was 0 80 bai et al 2019 evaluated the performance of the ja model for t estimation combined with shuttleworth wallace s w when parameterized based on monte carlo simulations and the results showed that the method provided more reasonable parameterizations for spring maize t simulations with the value of r2 and rmse were 0 91 and 0 68 mm d 1 liu et al 2020 recalibrated the parameters in the ja model by using the nonlinear least squares method lsm to improve the accuracy of rice et estimations and they found that the pm model with the adjusted rc performed better than the s w model and the mean rmse values of pm were 0 043 0 053 and 0 046 mm h 1 at the early middle and late growth stage studies have concluded that optimized mathematical models are more accurate when compared with the original versions e g ahmadi et al 2021 and chia et al 2021 but the accuracies of various parameter optimization methods differ significantly the recent boom in artificial intelligence algorithms has advanced studies in agriculture and hydrology abd elmaboud et al 2021 alizadeh et al 2021 but the possible application of swarm intelligence optimization algorithms to empirical parameter optimization in mathematical models requires more attention bohaienko et al 2021 used the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm to identify the parameters in a water transport model and they demonstrated that using the optimized parameters significantly improved the accuracy of simulations by up to 19 the quantum pso qpso algorithm and mind evolutionary algorithm mea have been applied successfully in many studies luo et al 2018 wang et al 2018 but few have investigated the optimization of the empirical parameters especially for rc models as mentioned applying these swarm intelligence optimization algorithms for rc models is of great significance however the optimal parameters which can obtain accurate estimates of rc may vary temporally and spatially according to the conditions in the external environment and plant physiology yu et al 2017 applied the ja model in a summer maize field during four different growth stages and found that linear fitting of the empirical parameters with the divided growth period could obtain more accurate estimates of the maize rc jiang et al 2016 developed an et model based on canopy resistance in an arid region of northwest china and determined that obtaining the effective resistance by aggregating the plant and soil resistances weighted by the leaf area index lai was more suitable for estimating water use in maize with r2 mean absolute error mae and rmse of 0 76 69 2 s m 1 and 85 6 s m 1 in 2013 respectively and 0 78 56 1 s m 1 and 96 4 s m 1 in 2014 respectively li et al 2016 applied the ja model fitted by the segmented method according to different lai thresholds for estimating maize rc in an arid area of china and showed that the ja model fitted by the segmented method with an lai threshold value of 0 5 m2 m 2 could significantly improve the accuracy of maize et estimates with the improvement values of r2 and rmse were 0 83 and 0 77 mm d 1 respectively when integrated with the pm model the concern is justified regarding the influence of structure selection environmental constraint function of ja model parameter optimization empirical parameter in ja model and growth period segmentation according to lai on the accuracy of ja models but this problem has rarely been systematically studied moreover several studies have aimed to improve the accuracy of the estimates obtained with agricultural and hydraulic models by using swarm intelligence optimization algorithms but applications to ja models are rare remarkably the genetic algorithm ga qpso and mea have not been evaluated for parameter optimization in apple tree rc models based on the rain fed field experiments in apple trees conducted on the loess plateau of china during 2008 2010 our objectives were to 1 use the reversed pm model to calculate the surface canopy resistance rc of the apple trees and determine its daily variations based on meteorological vegetation and soil factors 2 explore the importance of environmental constraint function forms of ja submodels for estimating rc in different growth stages and achieved the optimal segmented ja model according to lai 3 compare the accuracy when using the ga qpso and mea algorithm for parameter optimization in the ja model and attained the optimal empirical parameters in the optimal segmented ja model and 4 compare the accuracy of the calibrated optimal segmented ja models with other rc models which integrated with the pm model for transpiration t estimation using the lai vapor pressure difference vpd net solar irradiance rn air temperature ta and soil water content θa during 2008 2010 thus we can obtain the most accurate t estimation model for precise irrigation management in apple trees on the loess plateau of china which was acceptable after being locally calibrated using accessible plant meteorological and soil water content data across a wide range of climates 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the experiment was conducted at the shiyanghe agricultural and ecological water saving experimental

orchard soil was siltigic orthic anthrosols and the soil texture is sandy loam with a dry bulk density of 1 46 kg m 3 the apple orchard was rainfed before and planted in desert soil with soil water content at field capacity and wilting point being 0 33 m3 m 3 and 0 06 m3 m 3 respectively the field capacity is defined as the amount of soil water content held in soil after excess water has drained

which is controlled by the diversion flow and irrigation time takes place when the soil reaches the lower limits and terminates on the upper limits and the upper and lower limits of irrigation ranged between 65 and 100 field water capacity θfc liu et al 2012 2 2 data and measurement the net solar irradiance air relative humidity rh wind speed u2 and air temperature tmax tmin and ta were recorded at the height of 2 0 m by a meteorological monitoring system meteorological monitoring system jauntering taiwan which was installed 150 m away from the apple orchards the meteorological data were

factor yates et al 2015 vapor pressure deficit vpd was calculated from air temperature and relative humidity using equations from allen et al 1998 the volumetric soil water content θa in the root zone of five representative apple trees was measured every 5 7 days by tube type time domain reflectometry tube tdr imko micro modultechink germany four tubes for each tree were installed in the row and inter row space at 30 cm relative to the trees with an installation depth of 100 cm the soil water content at the vertical profile in each tube was measured at every 10 cm layer soil water content measured by tube tdr was calibrated by the oven drying method every month and the gravimetric was converted to volumetric water content values by multiplying the bulk density of the soil campbell and campbell 2005 leaf area index lai was measured by the winscanopy canopy analysis system winscanopy 2006a regent quebec canada for five representative apple trees the hemispherical photography was taken on sunny days every 5 7 days and was analyzed by winscanopy 2006a software to obtain the lai of the apple tree then the lai was interpolated by the quadratic equation between lai and day of year doy each year when calculating transpiration the sap flow rates in apple trees were monitored by the commercial sap flow sensors model sf100 greenspan technology pty ltd warwick australia consisting of two temperatures and one heater probe thermal dissipation method was used to monitor trunk sap flow sf automatically five representative apple trees were selected and the probe was buried at a

upscaled to stand transpiration tsf through dividing the daily sap flow sf by the canopy area of the individual trees fu et al 2016 granier 1987 liu et al 2012 1 t sf s f d a sw a can 10 3 where tsf

and f θ a represent constraint functions for vpd rn ta and θa respectively the specific formulae used to calculate the constraint functions are given in table 1 notably the structural model configurations produced with different formulae for environmental constraint functions yielded 81 ja submodels and these submodels can be separated into 12 sub groups according to the constraint functions used for environmental factors e g jar1 jar2 and jar3 denote that the first second and third form of radiant constraint function were used in the submodel respectively hence the ja type submodels differed in terms of their structural configurations and empirical parameters the abbreviations and configurations of the ja type submodels used in this study are presented in table 2 the model parameter estimation process involves searching for values that influence the accuracy by fitting independent observations thereby resulting in equifinality between the mathematical model and the real system taking rc pm as benchmark values this study calibrated these jarvis submodels using data during 2008 2009 and the data during 2010 was used to evaluate the optimized models 2 4 2

applied ga qpso and mea to calibrate the jarvis submodels and the flowcharts illustrating ga qpso and mea are shown in fig 2 2 5 1 genetic algorithm ga the ga was proposed by holland 1975 to find the optimal solution by simulating the biological evolution process the ga transforms the problem that needs to be solved into the evolution of a biological population where the search direction adaptively changes to search for the global optimal solution according to the probability theory method the ga has four basic operators selection crossover mutation and selection the algorithm has a good global search capacity and it can quickly search all solutions in the solution space without being trapped by a rapid descent into locally optimal solutions due to its inherent parallelism it is convenient to implement ga by distributed computing and speed up the solution search process for a mathematical description of the ga process see the study by garcia and lôndero 2021 2 5 2 quantum behaved particle swarm optimization qpso the pso is an optimization algorithm based on population foraging proposed by kennedy and eberhart 1995 and is essentially an improved ga algorithm that can achieve global optimization faster wu et al 2021 after generating an initial population the algorithm randomly initializes a group of particles in the feasible solution space each particle is a potential solution to the problem determined by the fitness function the direction of motion and distance of each particle in the multi dimensional search space is determined by its velocity and the velocity is affected by its inertia in each iteration the algorithm updates the velocity and position based on the personal extremum pbest and global extremum gbest li et al 2022 furthermore sun et al 2004 proposed the qpso algorithm characterized by a simple structure few parameters and fast convergence speed the qpso algorithm has been applied widely in various fields liu et al 2011 lu and he 2021 zhang et al 2021 by introducing delta square potential well centered on pbest into the pso algorithm the state of the particles is represented by a wave function ψ y 23 ψ y 1 l e p l l 1 β h 2 mr after solving using the monte carlo method the position evolution equation for the particle is obtained as follows 24 x p l 2 ln 1 u where l is the search radius of the particle which controls the search range and u is a random number between 0 1 in this study we introduce the average mbest for individual optimization to increase the convergence speed as follows 25 mbest 1 m i 1 m p i t 1 m i 1 m p i 1 t 1 m i 1 m p i 2 t 1 m i 1 m p i n t where the characteristic length l is 26 l i j t 2 α mbest x i j t the evolution formula for the particles then becomes 27 x i j t 1 p i j t 2 α mbest x i j t ln 1 u i j t where p i j t is the square potential well center of the ith particle in the jth dimension α is the contraction expansion factor i e α t t t is the current evolutionary algebra and t is the terminating evolutionary algebra 2 5 3 mind evolutionary algorithm mea the mea simulates the evolutionary process of human thinking through convergence and divergence processes which overcome the shortcomings of ga but also integrate the advantages of ga and evolutionary strategy wang et al 2018 the process followed to obtain the winning individual with a higher score through a competitive relationship in the subgroup is called convergence in all solution spaces if a subpopulation has a score that is less than that of the temporary subgroup in the superior subgroup the temporary subgroup with a larger score will replace the superior subgroup otherwise the temporary subgroup will be abandoned this process is called divergence the mathematical description of the mea process is as follows suppose that the population size in the mea is n the subpopulation size is m and the evaluation function is f then we can get 28 x m x 1 x 2 x m x i x i 1 2 m define a random mapping relationship s n x m 1 as 29 s n x σ x 0 x x 1 x 2 x m which indicates that a subgroup consisting of m new individuals is randomly generated from the normal distribution n x σ and parent individual with a given individual x x as the center define a random mapping relationship t x m 1 x such that 30 t x 0 x x 1 x 2 x m x t which indicates the winning individual is selected from m new individuals and parent individuals therefore the convergence process can be expressed as 31 s s n t x ω x define a random mapping relationship s o x n x n such that 32 s o x 1 x 2 x n x 1 x 2 x 3 x n where f x 1 f x 2 f x n indicates that the population is reordered according to the fitness function value define a random mapping relationship s u x n x n 1 such that 33 s u x 1 x 2 x n l x 1 x 2 x n l which indicates the individual in the subgroup with the worst fitness value define a random mapping relationship a d x n 1 x n such that 34 a d x 1 x 2 x n l l x 1 x 2 x l x l 1 x n which indicates that l new individuals are randomly selected in the solution space to replace the eliminated population therefore the divergence process can be expressed as 35 d s o s u a d x n x n the iterative population evolution process through convergence and divergence can be expressed as follows 36 x 1 k 1 x 2 k 1 x n k 1 s d x 1 k x 2 k x n k suppose that the population at time k is 37 p k x 1 k x 2 k x n k where x i k i 1 2 n is the winning individual in the ith subgroup and the fitness function is f i k f x i k mea retains the optimal solution in the operation process so if we suppose that the individual c k is the optimal solution obtained at time k then we have 38 f x k m i n 0 s k 1 i n f x i x suppose that the global optimal solution of the problem is x then we have 39 f f x m i n k f x k finally the population evolution process in mea can be described as the following sequence 40 f k f 0 f 1 f 2 f k where k is a positive integer representing the evolutionary algebra 2 6 water stress coefficient when the potential energy of the soil water drops below a threshold value the crop is said to be water stressed the effects of soil water stress are described by multiplying the basal crop coefficient by the water stress coefficient ks this study proposed the jensen method jensen et al 1970 which believes that the ks is logarithmic to the relative effective water content as follows 41 k s ln θ a θ w p θ f c θ w p 1 ln 101 where ks represents the water stress coefficient ks 1 for soil water limiting conditions and ks 1 when there is no soil water stress θfc θwp and θa are the field water capacity the wilting coefficient and the average soil water content respectively 2 7 path analysis path analysis is an extension of regression analysis li 1991 and it can decompose the interactions correlation coefficients between causal variables into direct effects direct path coefficients and indirect effects indirect path coefficients to study the data structure of causality this study analyzed the direct and indirect importance of independent variables for dependent variables for a correlative system with one dependent variable y and numerous independent variables xi i 1 2 n the multiple linear equations are expressed as follows 42 y a 0 a 1 x 1 a 2 x 2 a n x n where y represents the dependent variable xi represents the ith independent variable and ai represents the partial regression coefficient of the variable xi to y by substituting with the actual observed values the standard matrix equation can be established by solving the mathematical transformation of the equations using the lsm method 43 1 r x 1 x 2 r x i x n r x 2 x 1 1 r x 2 x n r x n x 1 r x n x 2 1 p x 1 y p x 2 y p x n y r x 1 y r x 2 y r x n y where r x i x j represents the correlation coefficient of variable xi and xj and p x i y is the direct path coefficient representing the direct effect of variable xi on y 44 p x i y a i σ x i σ y where σ xi and σ y represent the standard deviations of xi and y respectively and r x i x j p x i y is the indirect path coefficient representing the indirect effect of variable xi through variable xj to y the remaining variables represent the effects of other independent variables and errors on the dependent variable y where the p ey is calculated as follows 45 p ey 1 r x 1 y p x 1 y r x 2 y p x 2 y r x n y p x n y 2 8 model evaluation estimation accuracy indicators comprise the coefficient of determination r2 nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse and root mean square error rmse dong et al 2022 the ranking or comparison of many models with different statistical indicators is difficult thus global performance indicator gpi feng et al 2020 was used to comprehensively evaluate the estimation models these indicators are defined as follows 46 r 2 i 1 n y i y x i x i 1 n y i y 2 i 1 n x i x 2 2 47 n s e 1 i 1 n y i x i 2 i 1 n x i x 2 48 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i x i 2 49 g p i j 1 m α j s i j s i m e d i a n where xi and yi are the ith benchmark values i e rc pm and tsf and estimated values i e rc est and tsf est respectively x and y represent the corresponding mean values high values of r2 and nse closer to 1 and lower values of rmse indicate good prediction accuracy of transpiration models sii is the normalized value of r2 nse or rmse simedian is the median of the corresponding parameter m is the number of statistical indicators and α j is equal to 1 for r2 and nse and equal to 1 for rmse 3 results 3 1 quantitative variations in effect factors and relationships with canopy resistance fig 3a c shows that the seasonal meteorological factors i e vpd rn and ta varied unimodally during the apple tree growth period with average daily values of 1 5 kpa 13 1 mj m 2 and 10 2 c respectively fig 3d shows that θa fluctuated significantly under the effects of irrigation rainfall and evapotranspiration with a range of 0 19 0 31 m3 m 3 furthermore the values of ks at wuwei in 2008 2010 were always equal to 1 00 according to eq 41 see table s1 as supplementary material for the value of ks during the growth period of 2008 2010 which illustrated that there is no soil water stress in the apple orchard of wuwei station as shown in fig 3e lai exhibited a highly significant logarithmic varying trend during the growth period r2 0 94 p 0 001 the lai increased rapidly to 1 9 m2 m 2 in 2008 2 0 m2 m 2 in 2009 and 2 2 m2 m 2 in 2010 in the earlier growth stage doy 99 179 in 2008 doy 99 210 in 2009 and doy 100 208 in 2010 and remained stable after lai reached a maximum value in the late growth stage doy 180 269 in 2008 doy 211 269 in 2009 and doy 209 274 in 2010 therefore the whole apple tree growth period was divided into the partial stage and dense canopy stage by doy 179 in 2008 doy 210 in 2009 and doy 208 in 2010 lai lai max as the threshold in this study the measured apple tree transpiration tsf fig 3f varies with a range of 1 1 6 0 mm d 1 during the whole growth period and the maximum tsf often occurred in mid june doy 183 238 the daily variation in the pm derived surface canopy resistance rc pm during the whole growth period and for three years is shown in fig 4 these results show that rc was highest at the beginning of the growth period with a value of 9900 s m 1 and it then decreased abruptly at a rate of 120 s m 1 d 1 as the lai environmental factors i e vpd rn and ta and transpiration increased fig 2 where the minimum value was around 1000 s m 1 from early april to mid june i e partial canopy stage subsequently rc decreased gradually at a rate of 27 s m 1 d 1 as the lai stabilized until late september i e dense canopy stage where the minimum value was around 150 s m 1 this gradual decrease in rc occurred regardless of the relatively substantial decreases in the levels of environmental factors and transpiration due to the intense daily fluctuations of rc during the growth period the effect of θa on transpiration was not obvious these results suggested that the seasonal variations in rc could be controlled by lai vpd rn ta and θa throughout the growth stages of the apple trees although the relationships appeared complicated and ambiguous the path analysis method was used in this study to systematically quantify the relationships between rc and meteorological soil and vegetation factors as shown in fig 5 path analysis explained 80 81 and 79 p 0 001 of the variations in rc during the partial canopy stage dense canopy stage and whole growth stage respectively where the effects of lai vpd rn ta and θa considered in this study explained the variability in rc at the shiyanghe experimental station significantly the effects of vegetation climatic and soil factors on the daily variations in rc differed among the growth stages table 4 table 4 showed that lai was the most critical factor and had the main negative total effect on rc followed by vpd rn ta and θa with total effect values of 0 78 0 32 0 35 0 31 and 0 09 in the partial canopy stage and 0 72 0 50 0 31 0 01 and 0 24 in the whole growth stage moreover lai was the critical indirect effect path for ta in the partial canopy stage with indirect effect values of 0 45 in the whole growth stage and 0 46 in the partial canopy stage in addition vpd was the main positive regulator of rc among the climatic factors with a total effect value of 0 90 and it was the critical indirect effect path for rn and ta in the dense canopy stage in terms of rn it had indirect positive effects through vpd with values of 0 47 in the partial canopy stage of 0 57 in the dense canopy stage respectively in terms of ta it had indirect positive effects through lai and vpd simultaneously with values of 0 46 and 0 55 in the partial canopy stage but vpd became the main indirect effect path for ta with values of 0 61 in the dense canopy stage overall lai had the main negative total effect in the partial canopy stage and vpd was the main positive total effect in the dense canopy stage most importantly the total effects of meteorological factors i e vpd rn and ta in the dense canopy stage were more significant than lai thereby demonstrating that rc was primarily driven by meteorological factors after the plant canopy structure stabilized θa had no significant effects on the apple tree rc total effects range 0 09 0 24 presumably because the soil water content was not limited to transpiration table 4 3 2 accuracy of jarvis models for estimating canopy resistance in different stages as shown in tables s3 5 the submodel ja3322 performed the best gpi rank first among all of the ja submodels in this study with r2 nse rmse and gpi values of 0 71 0 65 1257 43 s m 1 and 1 00 in the whole growth stage 0 78 0 72 1203 31 s m 1 and 0 99 in the partial canopy stage and 0 78 0 77 445 61 s m 1 and 0 97 in the dense canopy stage fig 6 depicted the violin plots of r2 nse and rmse obtained by jarvis type submodels during the whole partial and dense growth stages as shown in fig 6 the accuracy of the estimates obtained by the 81 submodels varied significantly where the r2 values ranged among 0 26 0 71 in the whole stage 0 42 0 80 in the partial canopy stage and 0 27 0 82 in the dense canopy stage in addition the nse values had wide distributions with ranges of 0 29 0 65 0 04 0 72 and 0 12 0 77 in the whole partial and dense stages respectively similar results were obtained for the rmse values which ranged among 1252 99 2893 80 s m 1 1203 306 2987 31 s m 1 and 422 38 1491 89 s m 1 in the whole partial and dense stages respectively see table s2 as supplementary material for the value of empirical parameters of jarvis submodels in the different growth stages therefore our results indicate that the ja submodels were not always appropriate under various environmental constraint functions furthermore the variations in the accuracy of the estimates obtained by these submodels varied significantly among different apple tree growth stages the statistical indicators were considerably better in the partial or dense canopy stages compared with those in the whole growth stage fig 6 in the partial canopy stage the median r2 and nse values were improved by 7 1 and 12 4 respectively in the dense canopy stage the median r2 and nse values were improved by 12 2 and 13 4 respectively however the rmse was dimensional and not comparable among stages overall the segmented ja model built according to the lai threshold significantly improved the estimation accuracy for the apple tree rc 3 3 accuracy of constraint functions for estimating canopy resistance in this study differences in accuracy were found among the various environmental constraint functions for the jarvis type models as shown in fig 7 the accuracy of these 12 subgroups varied significantly for the constraint function of vpd jav3 performed better than jav1 and jav2 with median r2 nse and rmse values of 0 66 0 55 and 1322 97 s m 1 in the whole growth stage 0 76 0 67 and 1277 15 s m 1 in the partial canopy stage and 0 76 0 58 and 654 50 s m 1 in the dense canopy stage fig 7 showed the box plots of r2 nse and rmse obtained by jarvis type submodels composed of different environmental constraint functions as shown in fig 7 for the constraint functions of rn jar3 obtained estimates with the best accuracy compared with jar1 the r2 nse and rmse values of jar3 improved by 3 1 3 9 and 9 1 in the whole growth stage 14 4 13 5 and 17 7 in the partial canopy stage and 2 4 6 1 and 6 5 in the dense canopy stage respectively compared with jar2 the r2 nse and rmse values of jar3 improved by 10 5 7 7 and 18 1 in the whole growth stage 14 7 88 4 and 25 1 in the partial canopy stage and 3 4 1 2 and 7 8 in the dense canopy stage respectively however the best temperature constraint functions varied among the apple tree growth stages according to fig 7 jat1 jat1 and jat2 performed better in terms of accuracy in the whole partial and dense stages respectively compared with the other functions in the whole growth stage the r2 nse and rmse values of jat1 were improved by 3 9 11 0 and 6 7 and by 85 6 81 7 and 52 6 compared with jat2 and jat3 respectively in the partial canopy stage the r2 nse and rmse values of jat1 were improved by 10 4 10 7 and 13 6 and by 4 8 10 5 and 7 0 compared with jat2 and jat3 respectively in the dense canopy stage the r2 nse and rmse values of jat2 were improved by 1 1 17 1 and 2 5 and by 15 0 38 0 and 31 5 compared with jat1 and jat3 respectively similarly comparisons of the constraint functions for θa showed that the optimal function was not consistent in different growth stages according to fig 7 jaw1 jaw3 and jaw1 performed better in terms of accuracy in the whole partial and dense stages respectively compared with the other functions in the whole growth stage the r2 nse and rmse values of jaw1 were improved by 11 5 0 5 and 21 4 and by 17 1 19 0 and 23 2 compared with jaw2 and jaw3 respectively in the partial canopy stage the r2 nse and rmse values of jat3 were improved by 0 1 10 8 and 9 7 and by 7 6 10 6 and 11 2 compared with jat1 and jat2 respectively in the dense canopy stage the r2 nse and rmse values of jaw1 were improved by 0 8 15 5 and 5 7 and by 4 3 14 9 and 12 5 compared with jaw2 and jaw3 respectively overall the most accurate constraint function was consistent for vpd and rn whereas no unique function achieved the best accuracy for ta and θa in different apple tree growth stages in particular the best environmental constraint functions were v3 r3 t1 and w1 in the whole growth stage v3 r3 t1 and w3 in the partial canopy stage and v3 r3 t2 and w1 in the dense canopy stage respectively 3 4 accuracy of swarm intelligence algorithms for optimizing jarvis models the 81 ja type submodels were optimized using ga qpso and mea and compared with lsm as the original method i e ja model fig 8 displayed violin plots of r2 nse and rmse obtained by lsm ja ga ja qpso ja and mea ja during the whole partial and dense growth stages as shown in fig 8 the ranges of the accuracy improvements for the different enhanced ja type submodels i e ga ja qpso ja and mea ja varied significantly for ga ja the r2 nse and rmse values improved by 19 4 14 9 and 5 4 in the whole stage 8 0 8 0 and 6 6 in the partial canopy stage and 4 0 7 1 and 2 6 in the partial canopy stage respectively for qpso ja the r2 nse and rmse values improved by 22 6 18 9 and 10 3 in the whole stage 13 2 10 9 and 15 3 in the partial canopy stage and 6 5 12 6 and 5 9 in the partial canopy stage respectively for mea ja the r2 nse and rmse values improved by 28 2 38 9 and 24 8 in the whole stage respectively 18 8 24 5 and 28 2 in the partial canopy stage and 13 3 31 7 and 33 9 in the dense canopy stage respectively moreover comparisons of the accuracy of the swarm intelligence algorithms demonstrated that mea achieved the best performance with median r2 nse and rmse values of 0 79 0 73 and 1014 14 s m 1 in the whole stage 0 82 0 73 and 1096 189 s m 1 in the partial canopy stage and 0 82 0 76 and 432 53 s m 1 in the dense canopy stage respectively compared with ga ja mea ja improved the r2 nse and rmse values by 7 4 20 9 and 20 4 in the whole stage 10 1 15 3 and 23 1 in the partial canopy stage and 8 9 22 9 and 32 1 in the dense canopy stage respectively compared with qpso ja mea ja improved the r2 nse and rmse values by 4 5 16 9 and 16 1 in the whole stage 5 0 12 3 and 15 2 in the partial canopy stage and 6 4 16 9 and 29 7 in the dense canopy respectively comparisons of the accuracy of the optimization algorithms applied to ja3322 also demonstrated that mea ja3322 achieved the best performance based on gpi values gpi 1 00 at improving the ja model where the r2 nse and rmse values were 0 83 0 78 and 915 52 s m 1 in the whole stage 0 88 0 83 and 1003 65 s m 1 in the partial canopy stage and 0 93 0 87 and 311 51 s m 1 in the dense canopy stage respectively fig 9 compared with lsm ja the gpi value of ga ja and qpso ja mea ja were improved by 144 9 184 3 and 200 0 in the whole growth stage 89 0 141 2 and 200 0 in the partial canopy stage and 130 6 151 5 and 200 0 in the dense canopy stage respectively overall mea obtained the best accuracy at optimizing empirical parameters in ja submodels for estimating the apple tree rc followed by qpso ga and lsm according to fig 9 rc pm was overestimated at low values but underestimated at high values moreover the plots versus measured transpiration values matched best along the 1 1 line for the mea ja3322 model but with some widely distributed outlier points at the high value region around the regression line especially in the whole and partial canopy stages 3 5 accuracy of jarvis models integrated with pm for estimating transpiration different configurations of the rc model led to various forms of rc based pm equations the evaluation results obtained for the rc based pm equations when estimating apple tree transpiration indicated that there were clear differences in accuracy between different rc based pm equations fig 10 as shown in fig 10 the comprehensive accuracies gpi of the models were ranked as follows in the whole growth stage pmmea ja3322 pmqpso ja3322 pmga ja3322 pm lsm ja3322 pmkl pmfa pmst pmsg pmma the gpi values for the models were ranked as follows in the partial canopy stage pmmea ja3322 pmqpso ja3322 pmga ja3322 pm lsm ja3322 pmkl pmst pmfa pmsg pmma the gpi values for the models were ranked as follows in the dense canopy stage pmmea ja3322 pmqpso ja3322 pmga ja3322 pm lsm ja3322 pmkl pmst pmfa pmsg pmma respectively therefore ja models performed better than kl fa st sg and ma at estimating transpiration when integrated with pm fig 10 shows scatter plots of the measured versus estimated apple tree transpiration values obtained by rc models integrated with the pm equation according to fig 10 the plots versus measured transpiration values matched well along the 1 1 line for the pmja3322 model but with some widely distributed outlier points around the regression line furthermore the swarm intelligence optimization algorithms i e ga qpso and mea significantly improved the apple tree transpiration simulation accuracy for the rc based pm model as expected pmmea ja3322 obtained the best performance based on gpi with r2 nse rmse and gpi values of 0 81 0 76 0 69 mm d 1 and 1 00 in the whole growth stage 0 92 0 84 0 63 mm d 1 and 1 00 in the partial canopy stage and 0 93 0 86 0 42 mm d 1 and 1 00 in the dense canopy stage respectively fig 10 similarly as shown in fig 10 pmga ja3322 and pmqpso ja3322 were more accurate than the pmlsm ja3322 model where the corresponding gpi values were improved by 246 7 and 421 9 in the whole growth stage 68 2 and 74 7 in the partial canopy stage and 391 7 and 638 3 in the dense canopy stage compared to the value of pm lsm ja3322 respectively in addition the degree of dispersion for the data points in the scatter plot for pmmea ja3322 was substantially lower than for those in the plots for pmga ja3322 and pmqpso ja3322 fig 10 thereby demonstrating the high potential of using the mea for calibrating the empirical parameters in the ja model overall ja was the most accurate empirical rc model at estimating the transpiration of the apple tree when integrated with pm and mea was the most suitable parameter optimization method for the rc based pm model on the loess plateau 4 discussion 4 1 mechanism analysis for the relationships between canopy resistance and the factors which affect it it is generally considered that stomata have evolved to provide a means for controlling water loss from plants while allowing photosynthesis jones 1998 mechanisms involved in the stomatal response to environmental conditions are multiple and have different quantitative effects on stomatal resistance stomatal resistance varies within a leaf between leaves in a canopy and between layers different researchers have studied the relationship between canopy resistance and its effect factors to help understand meteorological vegetation and soil water control on tree water use despite the structural and morphological changes in the lai which affect the relationships between the stomatal morphology and environmental factors lai has been used to derive canopy resistance from stomatal resistance as shown in other studies irmak et al 2008 lindroth 1985 zhang et al 2016 and its effect was relatively high at incomplete lai zhao et al 2020 this conclusion was consistent with the result of this study that lai was the most critical factor and had the main negative total effect on rc in the partial canopy stage r 0 78 p 0 001 as shown in table 3 furthermore this study found that vpd played a positive predominant role in the whole growth stage with the value of direct effect being 0 65 p 0 001 in the partial stage and 0 71 p 0 001 in the dense stage table 3 similarly landsberg and butler 1980 also concluded that stomatal resistance increased with the increase in vpd it is presumably because stomata close when the difference between the vapor pressures of the leaf and atmosphere vpd increases to prevent excessive loss of leaf moisture merilo et al 2018 as the primary energy source of humidity and temperature this study found that vpd and ta were the main effect paths from rn to rc consistently gowdy et al 2022 also concluded that canopy conductance varies diurnally in negative response to changes in rn average air temperature ta is of great significance to plant growth and development and strong correlations with the lai are found for the mean daily air temperatures hardwick et al 2015 moreover vpd increases with temperature because molecular speeds are higher as temperature increases lamb and shaw 2016 all these physical and physiological mechanisms explain that ta has an indirect effect through lai and vpd in the partial and dense growth stages respectively conventional wisdom has it that water stress in mature leaves may be a major factor in stomatal closure to reduce water loss with the increase of canopy resistance daszkowska golec and szarejko 2013 however this study found that θa did not significantly affect the rc of apple trees presumably because adequate water management led to no water stress in the study area ks 1 according to chen et al 2020 who further concluded that θa would not significantly affect rc when the soil moisture was sufficient 20 thus there is no significant soil drought at the apple orchard for the test and the atmospheric demand is the most significant factor affecting canopy resistance when irrigation is appropriate 4 2 reasons for accuracy differences of jarvis models at different growth stages despite the significant nonlinearity and temporality of rc this study found that meteorological soil and vegetation factors i e lai vpd rn ta and θa could explain most of the variation 79 81 in the apple tree rc during the growth period according to path analysis fig 5 thus the differences in the accuracy of the estimates obtained by the rc models among different apple tree growth stages were also strongly associated with seasonal variations in these factors consistent with the results of this study chen et al 2020 also concluded that plants generally experience and acclimatize to various biotic and abiotic stresses during development thereby leading to changes in parameter values between the growth stages that are crucial for long term modeling li et al 2015 used an lai value of 2 0 m2 m 2 as the threshold for the partial and dense canopy to compare surface resistance models for estimating et and they also showed that the coupled surface resistance model significantly improved the accuracy and reliability of the pm model li et al 2016 estimated rc for maize using the ja model in the arid region of northwest china and found that a high rn in may could have resulted in a less accurate estimate of rc and caused the et estimation error thus rc modeling with consistent empirical parameters throughout the whole plant growth stage would lead to incorrect estimates for the real system furthermore we found dramatic changes in the main factor that affected the apple tree rc according to different lai thresholds according to figure 9 rc was overestimated at low values but underestimated at high values using ja models different from li et al 2015 this study obtained rc from tsf using inversed pm to avoid the indivisible problem between surface canopy resistance rc and surface soil resistance rs and thus the estimation result of ja models didn t affect by the thoughtless of rs garcia santos et al 2009 irmak and mutiibwa 2010 shuttleworth and gurney 1990 in response to the above statement as shown in fig 9 this study found no significant difference in the estimation accuracy of rc using ja models between partial and dense canopy stages which was contrary to the conclusion drawn by li et al 2015 that the ja models were not reliable under the low lai condition but performed well when canopy fully covered the underlying surface the reason that can explain the misestimation of rc using ja models in this study may be these parameter calibration methods searched the optimal empirical parameters according to the global optimal strategy and sacrificed the estimation accuracy in the region of the extreme values he and qin 2021 ribeiro and moniz 2020 furthermore the statistical indicators improved considerably for the partial or dense canopy stage compared with those in the whole growth stage thereby indicating that effective accuracy improvements were obtained when the ja model was segmented according to lai thresholds similarly li et al 2016 concluded that fitting the ja model by segmenting according to an lai threshold value of 0 5 m2 m 2 significantly improved the estimation of the maize et when integrated with the pm model other studies have also shown that the pm model integrated with segmented rc models obtained better estimates after setting lai 1 0 m2 m 2 when the soil surface was completely covered dolman 1993 these studies suggested that rc is mainly controlled by the vegetation meteorological and soil effect factors in summary the pm model integrated with segmented ja models according to lai thresholds could improve the accuracy of estimates of the apple tree rc and transpiration 4 3 reasons for accuracy differences of the jarvis models composed of different environmental constraint functions in this study the accuracy varied significantly when the configuration of the ja type model was changed fig 6 the multiplicative ja type model has been applied widely for rc estimation and incorporated into the pm model for estimating transpiration since the ja model was proposed by jarvis 1997 various environmental constraint functions have been designed as well as different formulae table 1 wang et al 2014 also concluded that the selection of constraint functions is very important for canopy conductance modeling zhou et al 2019 incorporated the constraint function for the soil mineral nitrogen content into the modified ja type rc model and found that the model improved the accuracy of the pm estimation under different nitrogen application levels in general environmental constraint functions were selected arbitrarily in many previous studies to construct the ja model and various submodels were derived without specific consideration although this study found significant differences in accuracy among the various environmental constraint functions for ja type model the optimum constraint function of vpd and rn was always consistent at different growth stages however the optimum constraint function of ta and θa was different as the growth period changed this conclusion was consistent with the result of path analysis between rc and other environmental factors we found the effect path of vpd and rn were unchanged but the effect path of ta changed from lai and vpd in the partial stage to vpd in the dense stage since the mapping relationship between rc and ta differed significantly with the advance of the growth period the expression of their relationship has changed similar to our results chen et al 2020 found the differences in the constraint functions for ta vpd and rn by using the markov chain monte carlo method to compare the estimation accuracy of various ja type submodels in estimating the daily transpiration by rain fed jujube in terms of θa we found its effect on rc was insignificant which result in the difference in the optimum constraint function of θa in the different growth stages presumably because adequate water management leads to no water stress in the study area ks 1 which has been proved by samanta et al 2008 specifically this study found that the submodel ja3322 obtained the most accurate tsf estimates presumably because of the advantage in its environmental constraint functions over others functional expression of v1 r1 t1 and w1 were exponential functions in which the exponential function curve shows an increasing trend and the slope gradually increases that is a small change on the x axis can lead to a large change on the y axis miao et al 2017 it is common knowledge that the canopy resistance is very sensitive to environmental features chen et al 2020 gassmann et al 2019 hoshika et al 2017 thus the exponential growth of rc along with the environmental changes was unsound which has been proved by fig 7 moreover although we have calibrated these empirical parameters using three swarm intelligence optimization algorithms the constants in r2 t1 t3 w1 and w3 were unchanged according to the recommended or measured values which induced much uncertainty in ja submodels in the mathematical formula of r2 we accepted the recommended value of 1100 to compute the restrictive effect of net radiation although the value has no practical physical significance chen et al 2020 regarding t1 and t3 the optimum plant temperature topt of the apple trees in the mathematical formulas was defined as the temperature at which the transpiration rate reaches the maximum wang et al 2014 according to liu 2012 the topt value of apple trees red marshal in this study was 25 however was not optimally calibrated although lots of research achieved the topt value based on the field measurement method bai et al 2019 wang et al 2014 harris et al 2004 and li et al 2015 considered topt as an empirical parameter derived by multi variate optimization methods and the results showed better accuracy in rc estimations in future work we attempt to verify whether the optimized topt would improve the estimated accuracy in rc and tsf of apple trees the similar conclusion can be gained from the poor performance of w1 and w3 that the θwp and θfc in these constraint functions of soil water content were measured by field methods colman 1947 comparing v2 with v3 the inverse function v3 has a significant advantage over the linear function v2 because the relationship between vpd and tsf wasn t linear smith 2020 and the geometric characteristics of the inverse proportional function has proved more suitable to describe the environmental restrictions of vpd on rc as showed in fig 7 4 4 reasons for accuracy differences of the optimized jarvis models using different swarm intelligence algorithms modeling approaches provide solutions according to simplified or approximated processes for estimating rc so significant differences may occur with the ja model in realistic situations presumably because of numerous assumptions and approximations sarker and newton 2007 these differences may decrease when using complex models containing more mechanistic processes and more parameters using many empirical parameters generally leads to greater adaptability and the models may be closer to real systems but parameter acquisition can also be more difficult moreover problems such as parameter correlation non uniqueness ill posedness and parameter equivalence will lead to the generation of non unique parameter estimation results with traditional methods such as the lsm birdi et al 2021 nonlinear fitting method tang et al 2021 and trial and error approach bugajny and furmańczyk 2022 but it is impossible to prove whether the ja type rc models have used a local optimal value or if they have been optimized using an inappropriate method swarm intelligence algorithms are effective for estimating unique globally optimal parameters in mathematical models in the present study the swarm intelligence algorithms performed significantly better than the traditional methods at calculating the empirical parameters for the ja type models similarly wang et al 2009 compared three representative optimization methods for hydrologic parameter optimization which they applied to automatic parameter calibration for the xinanjiang model and they found that ga could globally coherently and rapidly converge to the optimal solutions and achieve satisfactory results however the improved pso algorithm qpso performed better than ga in the present study which is not in agreement with the results reported by li et al 2022 xi et al 2015 suggested that models calibrated with the qpso operated satisfactorily in calibrating rzwqm2 root zone water quality model 2 parameters based on single and multiple objective functions because which was attributed to its advantages of simple algorithm structure faster convergence speed and better convergence performance among the swarm intelligence algorithms applied in this study we found that the mea was most accurate at optimizing the empirical parameters in the ja model because of its specific characteristics mea combines the advantages of ga and evolutionary strategies and it also overcomes their shortcomings by transforming single layer population evolution into multi layer population evolution through its unique convergence and divergence processes to improve the global search efficiency of the algorithm in summary the swarm intelligence algorithms were more effective at parameter optimization compared with the traditional methods and mea was most suitable for optimizing the parameters in apple tree rc models 4 5 reasons for accuracy differences of transpiration estimation using different empirical canopy resistance models in this study as shown in fig 10 the path analysis method elaborated that lai vpd rn t and θa can explain most of the variations in rc 80 81 and 79 at the whole partial and dense canopy growth stage thus how to consider the coupling effect of meteorological physiological and soil water content on rc process is critical for simulating tsf results indicate that the ja models combined with pm achieved better performance against the other empirical canopy resistance models for estimating tsf fig 10 presumably because ja has considered the full effect of meteorological physiological and soil factors on rc for estimating tsf simultaneously li et al 2015 zhou et al 2019 however kl fa st sg and ma did not inadequately consider the effect factors on rc as shown in eq 18 22 kl and st were composed of lai rn and vpd as independent variables while sg merely considered lai and rn regarding fa and ma the effect of lai on rc was neglected which echoed their poor performance in estimating tsf furthermore this study found no significant difference in the estimation accuracy of rc using these empirical models between partial and dense canopy stages fig 10 which disagreed with li et al 2015 who concluded that these empirical rc models did not consider the contribution of the soil layer on evaporation and can t estimate the surface resistance thus these models are not suitable for the condition of partial canopy stage in another research proposed by matheny et al 2014 they indicated that the majority of land surface models have difficulty in resolving the dynamics of et for errors in calculating surface resistance especially in water stress conditions however this study found no significant difference in the estimation accuracy of rc between partial and dense canopy stage primarily because this study only deals with the estimation of rc and tsf at an area without soil water stress in a word this study used these empirical rc models to estimate the tsf integrated with pm was appropriate at both partial and dense canopy stages of apple trees on the loess plateau 5 summary and conclusions based on exploring the influence of growth stage segmentation model configuration selection and empirical parameter optimization on the estimation accuracy of the jarvis submodel for apple tree surface canopy resistance we compared the optimal jarvis model with other canopy resistance models integrated with penman monteith for transpiration estimation using leaf area index vapor pressure difference net solar irradiance air temperature and soil water content of apple orchard during 2008 2010 at wuwei city on the loess plateau of china the main findings of this study were canopy resistance decreased abruptly in the partial canopy stage and subsequently decreased gradually in the dense canopy stage lai and vpd were the main positive regulator in the partial and dense canopy stage respectively segmenting the jarvis models according to the lai can significantly improve the accuracy of the canopy resistance estimates ja3322 achieved the most accurate canopy resistance estimates and mea was the optimal algorithm for jarvis models generally the best environmental constraint functions were v3 r3 t2 and w1 in the whole growth stage v3 r3 t1 and w3 in the partial canopy stage and v3 r3 t2 and w1 in the dense canopy stage most of all the mea ja3322 model was the most accurate empirical canopy resistance model combined with the penman monteith model for estimating apple tree transpiration after local optimized by the mea algorithm using the historical lai vpd rn ta and θa the submodel ja3322 segmented according to lai can be proposed to estimate transpiration in different climates when integrated with the penman monteith model our findings reveal the response mechanism of apple tree stomata to environmental factors and prove that the model structure growth period segmented and model optimization have a significant impact on the accuracy of the jarvis model for estimating surface canopy resistance and the estimation accuracy of apple tree transpiration is improved through the coupling of optimal jarvis and penman monteith model as the productive component of evapotranspiration transpiration is difficult to directly measure by ordinary orchard managers in the traditional sense based on the findings drawn by this study the orchard managers can obtain the actual water consumption of apple trees accurately using lai vpd rn ta and θa furthermore the accurate estimated transpiration combined with accessible evaporation can be further proposed to develop the apple orchard irrigation plan for the orchard manager moreover orchard managers also can develop reasonable transpiration control strategies to maintain acceptable productivity and ensure the sustainability of orchard water resources management in this generally fragile ecological environment above all the finding of this study provides the most accurate actual water consumption information of apple trees using easily accessible meteorological soil and tree data for the effective day to day water management decision making of rain fed apple tree orchards on the loess plateau given space limitations this study can t fully explore the influence of lai threshold selection on surface canopy resistance modeling although researchers have begun to study the importance of lai threshold selection in addition this paper only researched the coupling of the canopy resistance model and single source evapotranspiration model i e penman monteith while the popular dual source model e g shuttleworth wallace in the field is not involved which is also the main shortcoming and research directions of our research moreover we also attempt to study other environmental constraint function forms and apply additional variables such as tree height stem diameter leaf water potential leaf temperature carbon dioxide soil nutrient or wind speed in the future since the result of the path analysis showed that the variables selected in this study cannot fully explain the variations in canopy resistance of apple tree last but not least although this study proposed a successful canopy resistance and transpiration modeling pathway including model structure selection growth period segmented and model parameter optimization for estimating transpiration on the loess plateau of china exploration of the application of different jarvis submodels across a wide

9169,accurate determination of energy partition inside greenhouses is a key procedure in optimizing efficient water management in this study micro meteorological data and energy fluxes of cucumber were measured during four planting seasons 2018 2021 in a venlo type greenhouse to analyze the energy manifestation in different growing stages the results showed that the latent heat flux λet was the primary component of net radiation r n accounting for 61 2 72 6 of r n during the whole growing seasons followed by sensible heat flux h 19 8 24 3 of r n and soil heat flux g 7 6 14 8 of r n the λet increased while both h and g decreased as the crop grew especially h was larger than λet at midday in the initial growing stage energy partition was intensely affected by the leaf area index lai the λet r n increased linearly with the increase in lai while the h r n decreased linearly and g r n decreased exponentially until lai reached 4 m2 m 2 canopy conductance g c priestley taylor coefficient α and the decoupling coefficient ω were calculated to evaluate the controlling factors over cucumber λet the high values of the α 1 15 0 05 and the ω 0 65 0 05 indicated that the cucumber λet was principally constrained by r n the g c was calculated by inverting penman monteith pm equation using aerodynamic conductance g a values obtained by the heat transfer coefficient h s method based on accurate convection regimes the g c varied from 1 42 to 17 98 mm s 1 and high g c values corresponded to high λet the λet was estimated by the ω model with the mean root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae equaled 32 65 and 25 73 w m 2 while the determination coefficient r 2 was 0 94 the h was reproduced by the bulk transfer bt model to validate g a with the rmse and mae equaled 32 57 and 24 95 w m 2 the r 2 was 0 86 the results also indicated that the simplified energy balance eb method was an optional approach to analyzing energy partition in greenhouses consequently more energy could be saved by avoiding the excessive application of water and thus improving crop water use efficiency in greenhouses keywords energy partition canopy conductance decoupling coefficient aerodynamic conductance priestley taylor coefficient data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction greenhouses as protected cultivations provide optimal crop production environments and have been recommended as an applicable strategy to improve crop management rahimikhoob et al 2020 the venlo type greenhouse is a commonly used greenhouse in agricultural production the climate of this type of greenhouse can be adjusted according to crop growing conditions with controllers to keep the temperature humidity co2 concentration and light intensity within desired ranges yang et al 2013 lin et al 2020 crop production relies on indoor micrometeorology and more specifically on the greenhouses thermal performance al helal and abdel ghany 2011 thus it is essential to understand the amounts of solar and thermal radiation converted into sensible and latent heat fluxes and the energy partition characteristics in greenhouses energy transfer between the soil surface and greenhouse atmosphere governs the physiological behavior of crops drives water circulation and energy storage baldocchi et al 2001 measuring and estimating techniques of each component of the surface energy balance have become widely useful to determine crop water requirements in agriculture the difficulty in analyzing energy partition in greenhouses has led to the progress of different approaches to determine the thermal radiation conversion inside these structures saadon et al 2021 zhao et al 2022 these approaches ranged from suitable for greenhouse conditions of the crop coefficient method for evapotranspiration estimation as raised by fao 56 to computational fluid dynamics evapotranspiration model based on radiative and convective fluxes fernández et al 2010 gavilán et al 2015 yan et al 2022a in general most thermal analyses rely on the simplified energy balance equation eb which includes net radiation r n soil heat flux g latent heat flux λet and sensible heat flux h the latent heat and sensible heat fluxes are key variables in energy and water vapor exchanges between the crop surface and the atmospheric conditions in greenhouses wilson et al 2002 li et al 2022 as the main component of energy flux λet accounts for over 90 of water losses in field agriculture crop production yan et al 2019 therefore a better understanding of λet is conducive to establishing an irrigation schedule to consume available water resources more productively and efficiently at present numerous methods are conducted to estimate λet in open fields such as eddy covariance scintillometry bowen ratio energy balance and satellite based methods odhiambo et al 2009 sánchez et al 2019 yan et al 2021 due to the structural and environmental differences between the greenhouses e g enclosure structure materials ventilation system low wind speed and higher relative humidity and the open fields yan et al 2018a the energy fluxes variation and partition in greenhouses also differ from those in open fields as a result the penman monteith pm and the priestley taylor pt models have been modified to identify and estimate energy fluxes in greenhouses over the past decades pereira 2004 morille et al 2013 yan et al 2019 meanwhile the weighing lysimeters were treated as precise and convenient methods for guaranteeing continuous and accurate determination of crop hourly λet in greenhouses however analyzing energy variation and partition during the crop growing period in greenhouses based on the continuously measured hourly λet are still relatively scarce li et al 2020 generally λet is coordinated by physical and physiological factors physical factors can be quantified by the priestley taylor coefficient α and the decoupling coefficient ω physiological factors can largely be represented by canopy conductance g c ding et al 2015 jia et al 2016 oue 2005 the canopy conductance g c was described as the overall response of the crop to the environmental condition and it is also a key variable in the calculation of λet the priestley taylor coefficient α was determined by the ratio of λet to equilibrium evaporation λet eq which eliminated the weather effects and was usually used to evaluate the effect that controls λet among different canopy types jiao et al 2018 lei and yang 2010 to quantify the degree of stomatal control on λet the sensitivity of λet to g c was proposed by jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 through introducing a decoupling coefficient ω which ranged from 0 for perfect coupling with the atmosphere to 1 0 for complete isolation when the aerodynamic conductance g a tends to infinity there is a high efficiency of hydrothermal transport through the underlying surface which means the crop surface is well coupled with environmental conditions while g a tends to zero there is a low efficiency of hydrothermal transport through the underlying surface which means the crop surface is poorly coupled with the environment many studies have investigated the influence of these factors on λet in open fields and indicated that different crops led to inconsistent results tian et al 2017 jia et al 2016 nicolás et al 2008 liu et al 2019 found a high ω and α in a rotated paddy field indicating that r n was the main factor influencing λet in contrast rodrigues et al 2014 found a low ω suggesting a high surface atmosphere coupling existed and λet was primarily controlled by g c in tropical savanna jiao et al 2018 found the ω for maize canopy was higher than that for grapevine indicating that maize λet was more affected by r n and grapevine λet was more influenced by g c moreover previous studies had shown the relationship between g c and λet indicating different crops had various thresholds of g c to distinguish the λet was influenced by either available energy or canopy conductance threshold values of g c tended to be 10 mm s 1 for spring maize gao et al 2018 8 mm s 1 for mulched cotton in arid regions tian et al 2017 and 12 mm s 1 for grassland ryu et al 2008 however there have been few studies about analyzing the effects of physical and physiological factors on λet in greenhouses possibly because of the difficulties in determination of g a due to the extremely low wind speed u and complicated structure conditions in greenhouses g a is a key parameter for calculating g c and ω and it can be determined by a logarithmic profile of wind speed which describes the turbulent transfer of water vapor between the canopy surface and the atmosphere in open fields brutsaert et al 1982 the accuracy of estimated h by the bulk transfer bt model also depends on the aerodynamic resistance r a which is calculated as the inverse of g a r a 1 g a nevertheless the method may not suitable for greenhouses due to the quite low wind speed yan et al 2018a thus a heat transfer coefficient h s method has been used to determine g a in greenhouses the equations for calculating g a vary for different types of convection regimes qiu et al 2013 and gong et al 2021 analyzed the convection regimes and determined g a in greenhouses indicating that mixed convection was the main convection however different greenhouse types and crops may lead to different convection regimes so the determination of the h s based on accurate convection regimes is critical for the precise calculation of g a in a venlo type greenhouse therefore the primary objectives of this study are 1 to calculate g a based on accurate convection regimes and analyze the mechanisms of physiological and physical controlling factors g c ω and α that affect λet of greenhouse cucumber 2 to verify the accuracy of g a through estimating h based on bt equation and accomplish the simulation of λet using ω model in a venlo type greenhouse 3 to analyze the variations of energy fluxes and understand energy partition characteristics of the greenhouse cucumber at different growing stages 2 material and method 2 1 experimental site the experiment was conducted during four planting seasons mar jun in 2018 2019 2020 and 2021 of cucumber plants in a venlo type greenhouse located in the jiangsu province china 32 11 n 119 10 e 23 m a s l the experimental area is a humid sub tropical monsoon climatic zone with an average annual air temperature of 15 6 c and mean annual precipitation rainfall of 1058 8 mm y 1 yan et al 2018b the greenhouse

roof with a maximum of 4 5 m at the highest end and a height of 3 8 m at both ends the ventilation system comprises two axial fans 1 5 m in diameter side panels and roof vents there is a shading system on the roof for blocking the extremely strong sunlight and reducing the indoor temperature the greenhouse was oriented east west and the crop was planted in north south direction for better interception of sunlight the plant medium used in the greenhouse was soil biochar mixture with a mean bulk density of 1 266 g cm 3 field capacity of 0 408 cm3 cm 3 and wilting point water content of 0 16 cm3 cm 3 in the depth of 0 30 cm yan et al 2018a cucumber f1 hybrid seedlings were transplanted into the greenhouse troughs 0 65 m in width 16 7 m in length after growing seedlings on march 23 2018 april 12 2019 march 28 2020 and april 1 2021 with a plant density of 6 5 plants m 2 the cucumber growing period was divided into four stages initial development middle and late growing stages an automatic drip irrigation system was employed to supply water for cucumber plants the irrigation amounts and frequency were referred to the accumulated pan evaporation e pan measured by an evaporation pan 0 2 m in diameter and 0 1 m in depth at 8 00 every morning which was placed at 20 cm above the plant s canopy the plants were irrigated when the cumulative e pan reached 20 mm and 18 mm of water was used to irrigate crops previous studies conducted in the same area demonstrated that 0 9 e pan represented sufficient irrigation for cucumber plants yan et al 2020 to measure the latent heat flux λet of cucumbers inside the greenhouse three cucumber plants were transplanted into three lysimeters 30 cm in diameter 50 cm in depth which were placed in the greenhouse with the same density as plants in the troughs yan et al 2018a meanwhile the lysimeters were placed in the middle of the cucumber plants to reduce the impact of boundary conditions and its management was consistent with the plans in soil troughs allen et al 2011 the λet was measured by three accurate balances accuracy 1 g mettler toledo switzerland by weighing the decrease of the weight of the lysimeters with cucumber plants the λet of cucumber plants in the lysimeters was assumed to equal the values in the troughs due to the similar planting densities hourly data of the lysimeters were directly recorded by a cr 1000 data logger campbell scientific usa meteorological data was measured using a standard automatic weather station located inside the greenhouse near the cucumber plants the net radiation r n inside the greenhouse was measured by a nr lite 2 kipp zonen the netherlands at 2 m above the ground soil heat flux g was measured by three soil heat flux plates hfp01 l10 campbell scientific usa placed at 0 05 m beneath the soil surface the canopy surface temperatures t c and soil surface temperatures t s were measured by two infrared thermometers si 111 campbell usa stomatal conductance g s was measured every half an hour by a gfs 3000 heinz walz gmbh germany from 7 00 18 00 on sunny days at different growing stages of the cucumber plants measurements were taken from at least three different whole green sunlit leaves and replicated on each of twelve different plants volumetric soil water content and soil temperature were measured with hydra probe sensors stevens usa at 5 10 cm beneath the soil surface the air temperature t a and relative humidity rh were measured by a sensor onset computer corp usa at 2 0 m above the ground and the accuracy of the sensor for t a and rh are 0 2 c and 2 the wind speed u inside the greenhouse was measured by a 2d sonic anemometer 1405 pk 021 gill uk at the same height with t a all the meteorological data was stored every 10 s by a data logger cr 1000 and averaged every 10 min in this study hourly data were used for analyzing energy manifestation the leaf area index lai and plant height of cucumber plants were measured every 5 7 days the leaf length l and width w were measured with a measuring tape and the conversion coefficient of 0 65 for the leaf area was derived from fitting the measured results to the one drawn using cad software huang et al 2020 2 2 models description and parameters calculation we analyzed the seasonal and diurnal variations of energy fluxes environmental and physiological parameters as well as the correlation relationships the energy balance equation in the greenhouse is written as wight et al 1993 1 r n g h λ et where r n is net radiation w m 2 g is soil heat flux w m 2 h and λet are sensible and latent

expressed as a function of the nusselt number nu according to the flat plate theory the convection modes can be analyzed by using non dimensional groups such as the reynolds re the grashof number gr and the nusselt number nu the details about how to analyze the convection regimes can be found in table 1 the decoupling coefficient ω was introduced to analyze the sensitivity of λet to g c and

λet eq w m 2 are the imposed and equilibrium evaporation respectively the values of ω range from 0 to 1 when ω approaches 0 the cucumber canopy is well coupled with the atmosphere and λet is principally controlled by g c when ω approaches 1 the canopy is fully isolated from the atmosphere and λet is principally controlled by r n jiao et al 2018 the priestley taylor coefficient α normalized λet was used to quantify the relation between λet and other physiological and environmental factors monteith and unsworth 2008 it was calculated by priestley and taylor 1972 10 α λ et λ et

results 3 1 meteorological and crop growth data the variations of meteorological factors inside the greenhouse during the experimental periods in 2018 2019 2020 and 2021 were shown in fig 1 the air temperature t a ranged from 11 02 to 32 93 c in 2018 13 66 32 78 c in 2019 12 07 34 71 c in 2020 and 12 7 32 76 c in 2021 with averaged values of 23 95 25 77 27 08 and 26 18 c respectively the relative humidity rh ranged from 35 87 to 91 38 in 2018 31 04 93 56 in 2019 37 52 90 26 in 2020 42 64 97 65 in 2021 with averaged values of 65 86 66 34 69 05 and 69 45 respectively the variations of net radiation r n and soil heat flux g are depicted in fig 1 b daily r n values ranged from 13 65 to 158 12 w m 2 in 2018 6 27 143 21 w m 2 in 2019 2 68 120 93 w m 2 in 2020 and 3 34 to 121 32 w m 2 in 2021 with mean values of 70 93 72 86 49 34 and 61 77 w m 2 respectively daily g varied from 19 68 to 12 08 13 72 to 28 85 9 41 to 9 53 and 14 09 to 15 89 w m 2 with mean values of 0 91 4 25 0 77 and 1 08 w m 2 in 2018 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively the wind speed u was extremely low inside the greenhouse varying from 0 01 to 0 57 m s 1 the sharp change of u was mainly due to the ventilation system daily soil water content θ s ranged from 0 17 to 0 43 cm3 cm 3 the θ s ranged from 0 30 to 0 37 in the initial growing stage to 0 22 0 24 in the late growing stage the θ s tended to be high due to less water consumption in the initial growing stage during the middle and late growing stages θ s gradually decreased because of the higher water consumption as the crop grew besides a relatively higher value appeared when the irrigation was conducted the variations of lai and plant height of cucumber in four planting seasons 2018 2021 are shown in fig 2 the lai and plant height among the four planting seasons reached a maximum of 4 34 m m 2 and 2 03 m at the middle growing stage and decreased slightly with leaf senescence and plant topping similar results showed that the maximum lai and plant height of cucumber were 4 67 m m 2 and 1 86 m in the greenhouse huang et al 2020 3 2 seasonal variations of physical and physiological factors the variations of calculated g c ω and α from eqs 3 5 and 10 at different growing stages of four planting seasons 2018 2021 were shown in fig 3 g a is a key variable for calculating g c and ω as shown in table 2 the g a was quite low during the initial stage due to the low lai and u it gradually increased with the growth of cucumber and maintained a near value around 35 mm s 1 during the whole growth period the values of g a ranged from 1 28 to 38 81 mm s 1 the g a values were close to the results of yan et al 2018a and gong et al 2021 presented for greenhouse cucumbers and tomatoes respectively the g c represents the physiological factor that controls λet previous studies have indicated that g c was a great indicator of λet and high values of g c corresponded to high λet rodrigues et al 2014 tian et al 2017 liu et al 2019 the results showed g c varied approximately from 1 42 to 17 98 mm s 1 and λet increased as g c increased the g c was low during the initial stage and then gradually increased due to the increase in lai the value of g c reached a maximum of 17 89 mm s 1 during the middle growing stage which was lower than most crops demonstrated by kelliher et al 1995 g c 32 5 mm s 1 and similar to the results for greenhouse tomatoes g c 14 6 mm s 1 gong et al 2021 daily average values of g c were 3 55 7 24 10 67 and 10 14 mm s 1 for the initial development middle and late growing stages over four consecutive planting seasons in this study the ω and α are depicted as physical factors that control λet the values of ω varied from 0 43 to 0 92 and showed a slightly downward trend from the initial to the late growing stage in this study the ω values table 2 were greater than 0 5 threshold of ω for most days during four year experimental periods indicating the effect of r n on cucumber λet was greater than that of g c which represented the overall characteristic of canopy structure the ω values ranged from 0 71 to 0 92 in the initial stage indicating that there was a weak couple between the cucumber canopy and the environment and λet was more influenced by r n during the middle and late growing stages the days with ω lower than 0 5 16 18 14 and 13 days in 2018 2019 2020 and 2021 demonstrated that λet was primarily influenced by g c the variations of daily α ranged from 0 86 to 1 44 the α increased from the initial to the middle growing stage and reached a maximum of 1 44 probably because the energy absorbed by the canopy increased as the crop grew gao et al 2018 in the late growing stage the value of α decreased slightly the possible reason for decreased α was the rate of energy absorbed by the canopy decreased as the leaf senescence ding et al 2013 λet was mainly controlled by g c when the α value was lower than 1 0 lei and yang 2010 in this study the values of α table 2 were larger than 1 0 for the majority of the time during the growing periods for the four straight years indicating that most available energy was utilized by cucumber plants and λet was greatly influenced by r n 3 3 energy partitioning and its estimating hourly variations of energy fluxes at each growing stage for the four consecutive planting seasons 2018 2021 are presented in fig 4 in general energy components showed bell shaped curves through the day increasing rapidly along with sunrise reaching a peak near noon and decreasing afterward hourly r n varied from 32 46 to 486 13 w m 2 with a maximum of 355 61 and 486 13 w m 2 for the initial and middle growing stages respectively the λet ranged from 6 11 to 317 68 w m 2 and was approximately close to zero at night the proportions of energy fluxes in different growing stages are shown in table 3 the average ratio of λet to r n from 6 00 to 18 00 were 35 35 63 08 72 2 and 71 7 for the initial development middle and late growing stages respectively the h accounted for 49 53 27 98 22 1 and 22 43 of r n and varied from 25 51 to 181 48 45 84 to 152 6 29 51 to 134 17 and 38 83 to 139 8 w m 2 for the initial development middle and late growing stages respectively the measured hourly h was greater than λet at the midday of the initial stage and lower during other growing stages h reached a maximum around noon with the values of 181 48 152 6 134 17 and 139 8 w m 2 for respective growing stages the ratio of g to r ns f g 0 45 was substantially in agreement with the observations of choudhury et al 1987 f g 0 4 for spring wheat and fuchs et al 1972 f g 0 34 for a bare irrigated soil the g accounted for 15 28 10 2 6 53 and 5 9 of r n and varied from 17 65 to 58 61 1 13 to 35 67 2 97 to 25 71 and 1 58 to 23 62 w m 2 for the initial development middle and late growing stages respectively the λet r n increased rapidly from the initial to the middle growing stage and increased slightly in the late growing stage in contrast both averaged values of h r n and g r n generally decreased as the growing period progressed the maximum amounts of available energy r n g for the initial development middle and late growing stages were 347 87 437 51 430 27 and 413 61 w m 2 respectively to verify the accuracy of the estimated g a we reproduced h by eq 11 using data from 2018 to 2021 the comparison of estimated and measured h with varied g a was shown in fig 5 the results indicated that the estimated h was closely equivalent to the h obtained from the energy balance equation with measured λet with lysimeters as shown in table 4 the slope a of the linear relationships between measured and estimated h were 1 01 0 97 1 02 and 0 9 with the coefficient of determination r 2 of 0 85 0 86 0 87 and 0 84 in 2018 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively the bias were 0 04 0 09 0 12 and 0 03 the rmse were 34 17 33 85 30 81 and 31 46 w m 2 while the mae were 26 11 25 79 23 99 and 23 89 w m 2 in respective years since g a was the key parameter of the ω model the calibration of g a ensured the feasibility of the ω model in the prediction of λet in greenhouses according to the analysis of the relationship between daily ω and days after transplanting dat we found the daily ω was significantly correlated with dat and declined along with dat the daily maximum value of ω obtained in this study was 0 92 and maintained a value of 0 5 after 40 dat the calculated averaged ω values of the 0 40 and 40 90 dat from 2018 were used to estimate the λet of 2019 2021 by eq 8 to validate the accuracy of the estimated λet based on the ω model the comparison between measured and estimated λet was shown in fig 6 most of the regression points were scattered near the 1 1 line which indicated the measured λet could be represented by the ω model with good performance table 4 showed the statistical analysis indices between measured and estimated λet the slope a of the linear relationships between measured and estimated λet were 0 94 0 95 0 94 0 95 with the determination coefficient r 2 of 0 95 0 93 0 94 and 0 94 in 2018 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively the bias were 0 02 0 05 0 03 and 0 02 the rmse were 32 68 32 09 33 12 and 28 68 w m 2 while the mae were 26 13 25 19 25 31 and 26 12 w m 2 for the respective years 4 discussion 4 1 convection regimes in greenhouses the calculation of g a is the basis for determining energy fluxes in greenhouses and the classification of convection types which depends on the variations of gr re 2 is the key procedure to calculate g a in this study the variations of gr re 2 in the greenhouse were shown in fig 7 the data in fig 7 included different weather conditions sunny days may 4 9 and 12 cloudy days may 2 18 and 27 and rainy days may 6 15 and 21 in 2021 the gr re 2 remained stable at night and significantly changed during the daytime the gr re 2 values ranged from 0 1 to 10 for the majority of the time indicating the main convection type in the greenhouse was mixed convection which accounted for 75 6 of the whole growth period of cucumber the proportions of the forced and free convections were 16 5 and 7 8 respectively forced convection totally occurred in the daytime while free convection occurred in the night moreover the forced convection occurred in the daytime probably due to the opening ventilation system which resulted in high wind speed in the greenhouse different weather conditions led to different types of convection with free convection on sunny days and rarely on cloudy and rainy days fig 7 mixed convection occurred for the majority of the time during the whole growth period which was similar to the results obtained by gong et al 2021 for the greenhouse grown tomatoes in contrast qiu et al 2013 suggested that free convection occurred mainly during the night and early morning and no forced convection occurred in northwest china from the analysis of model parameters the main parameters that affected the type of convection in the greenhouse were the characteristic of a leaf the wind speed and the temperature difference between canopy and air therefore different regional climates greenhouse types and ventilation systems would influence these parameters and cause different results 4 2 physical and physiological controls of λet high decoupling coefficient ω values suggested a strong decoupling between canopy and environment indicating that there was a weak vapor transfer process over the cucumber canopy jiao et al 2018 tian et al 2017 liu et al 2019 the ω values for the initial growing stage were higher than 0 75 in this study a little change in stomatal conductance over the whole canopy would not contribute to any change in transpiration rate because of low lai and the λet was principally controlled by r n jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 at the beginning of the middle growing stage lai was large and potential transpiration tended to be high and water vapor transport gradually strengthened leading to lower values of ω gong et al 2021 because g a was low in the initial growing stage when λet was mainly controlled by r n katsoulas et al 2019 while during the middle growing stage increased g c had a greater influence on λet than in other growing stages the cucumber canopy tended to be coupled with the atmosphere than before and ω decreased slightly the values of ω table 2 were larger than 0 5 for most days of the whole growth period which indicated that r n was effective in driving λet rather than g c over greenhouse cucumber previous studies reported that different crops and environments had different ω values jiao et al 2018 found an averaged ω value of 0 3 for grapevine canopy in open fields and tolk et al 2006 pointed out that 0 5 was the usual value of ω in the semi arid cotton canopy ma et al 2015 illustrated that the ω ranged from 0 2 to 0 25 low ω and g c corroborated the overall water limited conditions for the highest alpine steppe zha et al 2013 found a close positive relationship between low ω and g c which indicated the et was sensitive to g c over a scots pine forest in eastern finland wullschleger et al 2000 found an average ω value of 0 23 which indicated that red maple canopies are partially decoupled from the atmosphere and the λet was mainly controlled by g c moreover jiang et al 2022 found the low ω over a humid region orchard which indicated that λet was strongly influenced by g c and the g c which was actually restricted by the soil water availability dominated the energy partition process a lack of moisture led to a significant decrease in stomatal conductance which constrained the release of λet high ω values were found in greenhouses probably because g a was much lower than that in open fields due to lower u crops were poorly coupled with the greenhouse atmosphere katsoulas et al 2019 in addition the ω model showed a good behavior in estimating λet the reason might not only be that the model had the advantage of taking into account the set of climatic variables r n and vpd but also the accurate determination of g a besides the ω model performed well in four planting seasons probably due to the sufficient radiation culminating in higher λet in the greenhouse the priestley taylor coefficient α for greenhouse cucumber gradually increased with the increase in lai and then slightly decreased during the late growing stage which was in agreement with the observations of lei et al 2010 for summer maize and qiu et al 2019 for winter wheat priestley and taylor 1972 suggested that 1 26 was regarded as a reference value for large wet ecosystems moreover gong et al 2021 reported that the α increased linearly with increasing in lai for greenhouse tomatoes since α was defined as the ratio of λet to λet eq the magnitude of α was determined by both λet and λet eq which was mainly controlled by r n as we discussed above the values of α were related to the r n received by the canopy which reacted to the amounts of lai in this study the values of α table 2 were larger than 1 0 for the majority of the time during the growing seasons which indicated that most available energy was adequately used by cucumber plants and other thermal components might provide extra energy for λet however previous research showed inconsistent results the α in this study was lower than that in rice paddy and maize fields liu et al 2019 and higher than in sparse grapevine fields jiao et al 2018 the reasons for different outcomes may be due to different climatic and environmental conditions planting density and field water capacity daily averaged canopy conductance g c ranged from 1 42 to 17 98 mm s 1 were found in this study and higher g c appeared during the middle growing stage for the four consecutive planting seasons similarly previous studies found that g c varied from 0 41 to 14 67 mm s 1 for greenhouse tomatoes gong et al 2021 and averaged g c value of 2 51 mm s 1 for sunflower canopy under the influence of soil salinity wang et al 2022 suyker and verma 2008 indicated that daily g c was 20 30 mm s 1 for an irrigated maize agroecosystem g c gradually increased as crops grew and had a greater effect on λet previous studies have shown the g c and ω were highly dependent on the soil moisture condition high g c and ω values appeared mainly during the wet period higher g c did not lead to higher canopy transpiration during the wet period compared to those in the dry periods in a lowland dipterocarp forest kumagai et al 2004 many studies have shown the relationship between α and g c jiao et al 2018 found a correlation between α and g c for grapevine canopy the values of α increased with the increase in g c and gradually kept constant when g c was over 15 mm s 1 indicating grapevine λet was more influenced by g c when g c was lower than the threshold of 15 mm s 1 gao et al 2018 pointed out that midday α during the growing season increased with the increasing midday g c until the g c reached the threshold of 8 mm s 1 in a spring maize field previous studies suggested different crops had various thresholds of g c ding et al 2013 lei and yang 2010 tian et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 indicating that λet of different crops was governed by either available energy or canopy conductance however in this study there was no specific threshold of g c probably because the daily value of α was larger than 1 0 for most of the time during the whole growth period and there was no obvious relationship between α and g c 4 3 energy partitioning during cucumber growing seasons solar radiation is a critical element to determine the energy balance of greenhouses considering the complicacy of mass and thermal transfer in the greenhouse previous studies had proposed some hypotheses including greenhouse structures steel frames and moist air do not absorb solar radiation and heat transfer between different substances of the greenhouses can be ignored takakura et al 2009 xu et al 2018 li et al 2020 in this study we analyzed energy components and partitioning based on a simplified energy balance equation under these hypotheses the r n is principally determined by solar radiation and is influenced by surface albedo allen et al 1998 the variation of r n is dominated by the difference between short wave and long wave incident solar radiation and the canopy architecture golkar et al 2018 bonachela et al 2020 the r n reached a maximum of 486 1 w m 2 during the daytime because of the high solar radiation and tended to zero in the late afternoon due to the absence of solar radiation and the low thermal radiation flux besides r n was negative at night because short wave solar radiation gradually became equivalent to long wave radiation from the underlying surface and short wave solar radiation decreased to zero over time at this time λet was larger than r n due to the occurrence of sensible heat advection which strengthened λet ding et al 2015 liu et al 2019 during the whole growth period the g was positive at midday and negative during the night the main reason for negative g was the thermal heat emitted upward from the soil surface at night in addition g was determined by the coverage of exposed soil g decreased as plant coverage increased and less energy was absorbed by the soil surface as canopy cover increased especially h was larger than λet at midday in the initial stage because the turbulent heat exchange between atmosphere and soil surface was significantly strong due to low canopy coverage as the crop grew more available energy was consumed by the cucumber plant λet accounted for 61 2 72 6 of r n which was the biggest consumption of r n during the whole growth period it is consistent with the results conducted by boulard et al 1993 for greenhouse tomatoes and tian et al 2017 for a cotton field however the λet for greenhouse grown cucumbers was lower than that for field grown cucumbers ertek et al 2006 we attributed this to the high rh and low u and in the greenhouse which might lead to low evaporative requirement harmanto et al 2005 in addition energy partition was significantly affected by the underlying coverage conditions which could be quantified as lai shen et al 2004 hammerle et al 2008 in this study the relationships between λet r n h r n g r n and lai were shown in fig 8 as lai increased λet r n increased while h r n and g r n decreased previous studies showed the same results in a vineyard sánchez et al 2019 and a greenhouse for hot peppers qiu et al 2011 particularly the g r n decreased exponentially as lai increased when lai was less than 4 m2 m 2 probably because the available energy would no longer be increasingly intercepted by the plant canopy when lai reached the effective threshold similar results were demonstrated by gong et al 2021 for greenhouse tomatoes 5 conclusion in this study we investigated the energy partition at different growing stages of cucumber in a venlo type greenhouse the convection modes were determined to calculate g a and the results indicated that mixed convection was the primary mode during the whole growth period in a venlo type greenhouse the physical α and ω and physiological g c factors were calculated to analyze their influences on λet the averaged values of both α 1 15 0 05 and ω 0 65 0 05 were high for most days in the growing seasons which indicated λet was principally influenced by r n the values of g c ranged from 1 42 to 17 98 mm s 1 and high g c values corresponded to high λet there was no obvious threshold of g c to distinguish the cucumber λet was governed by either available energy or canopy conductance the λet was the main component of r n accounting for 61 2 72 6 of r n over the whole growth period while followed by h 19 8 24 3 of r n and g 7 6 14 8 of r n the λet r n increased while both h r n and g r n decreased with the increase in lai the g r n decreased exponentially as lai increased when lai was less than 4 m2 m 2 the estimated and measured h was compared to calibrate g a the rmse and mae equaled 32 57 and 24 95 w m 2 the bias was 0 06 and the r 2 was 0 86 the λet could be estimated by the ω model with a good performance with the rmse and mae equaled 32 65 and 25 73 w m 2 the bias equaled 0 03 and the r 2 equaled 0 94 the simplified energy balance approach was an alternative way to analyze energy fluxes and partition in the greenhouse the statistical analysis revealed that the λet could be reproduced by the ω model with a good performance the predictions made in this study would be a relatively accurate and easy method to calculate cucumber energy fluxes in the greenhouse and thus the appropriate irrigation management could be built the findings in this study were based on long term observational data from the greenhouse and were considered representative of the venlo type greenhouse in order to confirm the transferability of our findings to other greenhouse types more research and further related analyses under different

9169,accurate determination of energy partition inside greenhouses is a key procedure in optimizing efficient water management in this study micro meteorological data and energy fluxes of cucumber were measured during four planting seasons 2018 2021 in a venlo type greenhouse to analyze the energy manifestation in different growing stages the results showed that the latent heat flux λet was the primary component of net radiation r n accounting for 61 2 72 6 of r n during the whole growing seasons followed by sensible heat flux h 19 8 24 3 of r n and soil heat flux g 7 6 14 8 of r n the λet increased while both h and g decreased as the crop grew especially h was larger than λet at midday in the initial growing stage energy partition was intensely affected by the leaf area index lai the λet r n increased linearly with the increase in lai while the h r n decreased linearly and g r n decreased exponentially until lai reached 4 m2 m 2 canopy conductance g c priestley taylor coefficient α and the decoupling coefficient ω were calculated to evaluate the controlling factors over cucumber λet the high values of the α 1 15 0 05 and the ω 0 65 0 05 indicated that the cucumber λet was principally constrained by r n the g c was calculated by inverting penman monteith pm equation using aerodynamic conductance g a values obtained by the heat transfer coefficient h s method based on accurate convection regimes the g c varied from 1 42 to 17 98 mm s 1 and high g c values corresponded to high λet the λet was estimated by the ω model with the mean root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae equaled 32 65 and 25 73 w m 2 while the determination coefficient r 2 was 0 94 the h was reproduced by the bulk transfer bt model to validate g a with the rmse and mae equaled 32 57 and 24 95 w m 2 the r 2 was 0 86 the results also indicated that the simplified energy balance eb method was an optional approach to analyzing energy partition in greenhouses consequently more energy could be saved by avoiding the excessive application of water and thus improving crop water use efficiency in greenhouses keywords energy partition canopy conductance decoupling coefficient aerodynamic conductance priestley taylor coefficient data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction greenhouses as protected cultivations provide optimal crop production environments and have been recommended as an applicable strategy to improve crop management rahimikhoob et al 2020 the venlo type greenhouse is a commonly used greenhouse in agricultural production the climate of this type of greenhouse can be adjusted according to crop growing conditions with controllers to keep the temperature humidity co2 concentration and light intensity within desired ranges yang et al 2013 lin et al 2020 crop production relies on indoor micrometeorology and more specifically on the greenhouses thermal performance al helal and abdel ghany 2011 thus it is essential to understand the amounts of solar and thermal radiation converted into sensible and latent heat fluxes and the energy partition characteristics in greenhouses energy transfer between the soil surface and greenhouse atmosphere governs the physiological behavior of crops drives water circulation and energy storage baldocchi et al 2001 measuring and estimating techniques of each component of the surface energy balance have become widely useful to determine crop water requirements in agriculture the difficulty in analyzing energy partition in greenhouses has led to the progress of different approaches to determine the thermal radiation conversion inside these structures saadon et al 2021 zhao et al 2022 these approaches ranged from suitable for greenhouse conditions of the crop coefficient method for evapotranspiration estimation as raised by fao 56 to computational fluid dynamics evapotranspiration model based on radiative and convective fluxes fernández et al 2010 gavilán et al 2015 yan et al 2022a in general most thermal analyses rely on the simplified energy balance equation eb which includes net radiation r n soil heat flux g latent heat flux λet and sensible heat flux h the latent heat and sensible heat fluxes are key variables in energy and water vapor exchanges between the crop surface and the atmospheric conditions in greenhouses wilson et al 2002 li et al 2022 as the main component of energy flux λet accounts for over 90 of water losses in field agriculture crop production yan et al 2019 therefore a better understanding of λet is conducive to establishing an irrigation schedule to consume available water resources more productively and efficiently at present numerous methods are conducted to estimate λet in open fields such as eddy covariance scintillometry bowen ratio energy balance and satellite based methods odhiambo et al 2009 sánchez et al 2019 yan et al 2021 due to the structural and environmental differences between the greenhouses e g enclosure structure materials ventilation system low wind speed and higher relative humidity and the open fields yan et al 2018a the energy fluxes variation and partition in greenhouses also differ from those in open fields as a result the penman monteith pm and the priestley taylor pt models have been modified to identify and estimate energy fluxes in greenhouses over the past decades pereira 2004 morille et al 2013 yan et al 2019 meanwhile the weighing lysimeters were treated as precise and convenient methods for guaranteeing continuous and accurate determination of crop hourly λet in greenhouses however analyzing energy variation and partition during the crop growing period in greenhouses based on the continuously measured hourly λet are still relatively scarce li et al 2020 generally λet is coordinated by physical and physiological factors physical factors can be quantified by the priestley taylor coefficient α and the decoupling coefficient ω physiological factors can largely be represented by canopy conductance g c ding et al 2015 jia et al 2016 oue 2005 the canopy conductance g c was described as the overall response of the crop to the environmental condition and it is also a key variable in the calculation of λet the priestley taylor coefficient α was determined by the ratio of λet to equilibrium evaporation λet eq which eliminated the weather effects and was usually used to evaluate the effect that controls λet among different canopy types jiao et al 2018 lei and yang 2010 to quantify the degree of stomatal control on λet the sensitivity of λet to g c was proposed by jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 through introducing a decoupling coefficient ω which ranged from 0 for perfect coupling with the atmosphere to 1 0 for complete isolation when the aerodynamic conductance g a tends to infinity there is a high efficiency of hydrothermal transport through the underlying surface which means the crop surface is well coupled with environmental conditions while g a tends to zero there is a low efficiency of hydrothermal transport through the underlying surface which means the crop surface is poorly coupled with the environment many studies have investigated the influence of these factors on λet in open fields and indicated that different crops led to inconsistent results tian et al 2017 jia et al 2016 nicolás et al 2008 liu et al 2019 found a high ω and α in a rotated paddy field indicating that r n was the main factor influencing λet in contrast rodrigues et al 2014 found a low ω suggesting a high surface atmosphere coupling existed and λet was primarily controlled by g c in tropical savanna jiao et al 2018 found the ω for maize canopy was higher than that for grapevine indicating that maize λet was more affected by r n and grapevine λet was more influenced by g c moreover previous studies had shown the relationship between g c and λet indicating different crops had various thresholds of g c to distinguish the λet was influenced by either available energy or canopy conductance threshold values of g c tended to be 10 mm s 1 for spring maize gao et al 2018 8 mm s 1 for mulched cotton in arid regions tian et al 2017 and 12 mm s 1 for grassland ryu et al 2008 however there have been few studies about analyzing the effects of physical and physiological factors on λet in greenhouses possibly because of the difficulties in determination of g a due to the extremely low wind speed u and complicated structure conditions in greenhouses g a is a key parameter for calculating g c and ω and it can be determined by a logarithmic profile of wind speed which describes the turbulent transfer of water vapor between the canopy surface and the atmosphere in open fields brutsaert et al 1982 the accuracy of estimated h by the bulk transfer bt model also depends on the aerodynamic resistance r a which is calculated as the inverse of g a r a 1 g a nevertheless the method may not suitable for greenhouses due to the quite low wind speed yan et al 2018a thus a heat transfer coefficient h s method has been used to determine g a in greenhouses the equations for calculating g a vary for different types of convection regimes qiu et al 2013 and gong et al 2021 analyzed the convection regimes and determined g a in greenhouses indicating that mixed convection was the main convection however different greenhouse types and crops may lead to different convection regimes so the determination of the h s based on accurate convection regimes is critical for the precise calculation of g a in a venlo type greenhouse therefore the primary objectives of this study are 1 to calculate g a based on accurate convection regimes and analyze the mechanisms of physiological and physical controlling factors g c ω and α that affect λet of greenhouse cucumber 2 to verify the accuracy of g a through estimating h based on bt equation and accomplish the simulation of λet using ω model in a venlo type greenhouse 3 to analyze the variations of energy fluxes and understand energy partition characteristics of the greenhouse cucumber at different growing stages 2 material and method 2 1 experimental site the experiment was conducted during four planting seasons mar jun in 2018 2019 2020 and 2021 of cucumber plants in a venlo type greenhouse located in the jiangsu province china 32 11 n 119 10 e 23 m a s l the experimental area is a humid sub tropical monsoon climatic zone with an average annual air temperature of 15 6 c and mean annual precipitation rainfall of 1058 8 mm y 1 yan et al 2018b the greenhouse

roof with a maximum of 4 5 m at the highest end and a height of 3 8 m at both ends the ventilation system comprises two axial fans 1 5 m in diameter side panels and roof vents there is a shading system on the roof for blocking the extremely strong sunlight and reducing the indoor temperature the greenhouse was oriented east west and the crop was planted in north south direction for better interception of sunlight the plant medium used in the greenhouse was soil biochar mixture with a mean bulk density of 1 266 g cm 3 field capacity of 0 408 cm3 cm 3 and wilting point water content of 0 16 cm3 cm 3 in the depth of 0 30 cm yan et al 2018a cucumber f1 hybrid seedlings were transplanted into the greenhouse troughs 0 65 m in width 16 7 m in length after growing seedlings on march 23 2018 april 12 2019 march 28 2020 and april 1 2021 with a plant density of 6 5 plants m 2 the cucumber growing period was divided into four stages initial development middle and late growing stages an automatic drip irrigation system was employed to supply water for cucumber plants the irrigation amounts and frequency were referred to the accumulated pan evaporation e pan measured by an evaporation pan 0 2 m in diameter and 0 1 m in depth at 8 00 every morning which was placed at 20 cm above the plant s canopy the plants were irrigated when the cumulative e pan reached 20 mm and 18 mm of water was used to irrigate crops previous studies conducted in the same area demonstrated that 0 9 e pan represented sufficient irrigation for cucumber plants yan et al 2020 to measure the latent heat flux λet of cucumbers inside the greenhouse three cucumber plants were transplanted into three lysimeters 30 cm in diameter 50 cm in depth which were placed in the greenhouse with the same density as plants in the troughs yan et al 2018a meanwhile the lysimeters were placed in the middle of the cucumber plants to reduce the impact of boundary conditions and its management was consistent with the plans in soil troughs allen et al 2011 the λet was measured by three accurate balances accuracy 1 g mettler toledo switzerland by weighing the decrease of the weight of the lysimeters with cucumber plants the λet of cucumber plants in the lysimeters was assumed to equal the values in the troughs due to the similar planting densities hourly data of the lysimeters were directly recorded by a cr 1000 data logger campbell scientific usa meteorological data was measured using a standard automatic weather station located inside the greenhouse near the cucumber plants the net radiation r n inside the greenhouse was measured by a nr lite 2 kipp zonen the netherlands at 2 m above the ground soil heat flux g was measured by three soil heat flux plates hfp01 l10 campbell scientific usa placed at 0 05 m beneath the soil surface the canopy surface temperatures t c and soil surface temperatures t s were measured by two infrared thermometers si 111 campbell usa stomatal conductance g s was measured every half an hour by a gfs 3000 heinz walz gmbh germany from 7 00 18 00 on sunny days at different growing stages of the cucumber plants measurements were taken from at least three different whole green sunlit leaves and replicated on each of twelve different plants volumetric soil water content and soil temperature were measured with hydra probe sensors stevens usa at 5 10 cm beneath the soil surface the air temperature t a and relative humidity rh were measured by a sensor onset computer corp usa at 2 0 m above the ground and the accuracy of the sensor for t a and rh are 0 2 c and 2 the wind speed u inside the greenhouse was measured by a 2d sonic anemometer 1405 pk 021 gill uk at the same height with t a all the meteorological data was stored every 10 s by a data logger cr 1000 and averaged every 10 min in this study hourly data were used for analyzing energy manifestation the leaf area index lai and plant height of cucumber plants were measured every 5 7 days the leaf length l and width w were measured with a measuring tape and the conversion coefficient of 0 65 for the leaf area was derived from fitting the measured results to the one drawn using cad software huang et al 2020 2 2 models description and parameters calculation we analyzed the seasonal and diurnal variations of energy fluxes environmental and physiological parameters as well as the correlation relationships the energy balance equation in the greenhouse is written as wight et al 1993 1 r n g h λ et where r n is net radiation w m 2 g is soil heat flux w m 2 h and λet are sensible and latent heat fluxes w m 2 the measured values of the latent heat flux λet in this study were obtained by the equation 2 λ et λ ρ m t i 1 m t i t i 1 t i where λ is the latent heat of water vaporization j kg 1 ρ is the cucumber planting density plants m 2 mti 1 and m t i kg are readings of the adjacent timescale t i 1 and t i s respectively canopy conductance g c was described as the overall response of the

expressed as a function of the nusselt number nu according to the flat plate theory the convection modes can be analyzed by using non dimensional groups such as the reynolds re the grashof number gr and the nusselt number nu the details about how to analyze the convection regimes can be found in table 1 the decoupling coefficient ω was introduced to analyze the sensitivity of λet to g c and calculated by jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 5 ω δ γ δ γ 1 g a g c 6 λ et imp ρ a c p vpd g c λ γ 7 λ et eq δ δ γ r n g 8 λ et ω λ et eq 1 ω λ et imp 9 d λ et λ et d g c g c 1 ω where λet imp w m 2 and λet eq w m 2 are the imposed and equilibrium evaporation respectively the values of ω range from 0 to 1 when ω approaches 0 the cucumber canopy is well coupled with the atmosphere and λet is principally controlled by g c when ω approaches 1 the canopy is fully isolated from the atmosphere and λet is principally controlled by r n jiao et al 2018 the priestley taylor coefficient α normalized λet was used to quantify the relation between λet and other physiological and environmental factors monteith and unsworth 2008 it was calculated by priestley and taylor 1972 10 α λ et λ et eq the sensible heat flux h is estimated by the bulk transfer bt model yan et al 2018a and r a is calculated as the inverse of aerodynamic conductance r a 1 g a the expression for sensible heat flux

obtained by eq 12 was seen as measured values comparisons between the estimated and measured values of λet and h were conducted by assessing linear regressions based on the determination coefficients

results 3 1 meteorological and crop growth data the variations of meteorological factors inside the greenhouse during the experimental periods in 2018 2019 2020 and 2021 were shown in fig 1 the air temperature t a ranged from 11 02 to 32 93 c in 2018 13 66 32 78 c in 2019 12 07 34 71 c in 2020 and 12 7 32 76 c in 2021 with averaged values of 23 95 25 77 27 08 and 26 18 c respectively the relative humidity rh ranged from 35 87 to 91 38 in 2018 31 04 93 56 in 2019 37 52 90 26 in 2020 42 64 97 65 in 2021 with averaged values of 65 86 66 34 69 05 and 69 45 respectively the variations of net radiation r n and soil heat flux g are depicted in fig 1 b daily r n values ranged from 13 65 to 158 12 w m 2 in 2018 6 27 143 21 w m 2 in 2019 2 68 120 93 w m 2 in 2020 and 3 34 to 121 32 w m 2 in 2021 with mean values of 70 93 72 86 49 34 and 61 77 w m 2 respectively daily g varied from 19 68 to 12 08 13 72 to 28 85 9 41 to 9 53 and 14 09 to 15 89 w m 2 with mean values of 0 91 4 25 0 77 and 1 08 w m 2 in 2018 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively the wind speed u was extremely low inside the greenhouse varying from 0 01 to 0 57 m s 1 the sharp change of u was mainly due to the ventilation system daily soil water content θ s ranged from 0 17 to 0 43 cm3 cm 3 the θ s ranged from 0 30 to 0 37 in the initial growing stage to 0 22 0 24 in the late growing stage the θ s tended to be high due to less water consumption in the initial growing stage during the middle and late growing stages θ s gradually decreased because of the higher water consumption as the crop grew besides a relatively higher value appeared when the irrigation was conducted the variations of lai and plant height of cucumber in four planting seasons 2018 2021 are shown in fig 2 the lai and plant height among the four planting seasons reached a maximum of 4 34 m m 2 and 2 03 m at the middle growing stage and decreased slightly with leaf senescence and plant topping similar results showed that the maximum lai and plant height of cucumber were 4 67 m m 2 and 1 86 m in the greenhouse huang et al 2020 3 2 seasonal variations of physical and physiological factors the variations of calculated g c ω and α from eqs 3 5 and 10 at different growing stages of four planting seasons 2018 2021 were shown in fig 3 g a is a key variable for calculating g c and ω as shown in table 2 the g a was quite low during the initial stage due to the low lai and u it gradually increased with the growth of cucumber and maintained a near value around 35 mm s 1 during the whole growth period the values of g a ranged from 1 28 to 38 81 mm s 1 the g a values were close to the results of yan et al 2018a and gong et al 2021 presented for greenhouse cucumbers and tomatoes respectively the g c represents the physiological factor that controls λet previous studies have indicated that g c was a great indicator of λet and high values of g c corresponded to high λet rodrigues et al 2014 tian et al 2017 liu et al 2019 the results showed g c varied approximately from 1 42 to 17 98 mm s 1 and λet increased as g c increased the g c was low during the initial stage and then gradually increased due to the increase in lai the value of g c reached a maximum of 17 89 mm s 1 during the middle growing stage which was lower than most crops demonstrated by kelliher et al 1995 g c 32 5 mm s 1 and similar to the results for greenhouse tomatoes g c 14 6 mm s 1 gong et al 2021 daily average values of g c were 3 55 7 24 10 67 and 10 14 mm s 1 for the initial development middle and late growing stages over four consecutive planting seasons in this study the ω and α are depicted as physical factors that control λet the values of ω varied from 0 43 to 0 92 and showed a slightly downward trend from the initial to the late growing stage in this study the ω values table 2 were greater than 0 5 threshold of ω for most days during four year experimental periods indicating the effect of r n on cucumber λet was greater than that of g c which represented the overall characteristic of canopy structure the ω values ranged from 0 71 to 0 92 in the initial stage indicating that there was a weak couple between the cucumber canopy and the environment and λet was more influenced by r n during the middle and late growing stages the days with ω lower than 0 5 16 18 14 and 13 days in 2018 2019 2020 and 2021 demonstrated that λet was primarily influenced by g c the variations of daily α ranged from 0 86 to 1 44 the α increased from the initial to the middle growing stage and reached a maximum of 1 44 probably because the energy absorbed by the canopy increased as the crop grew gao et al 2018 in the late growing stage the value of α decreased slightly the possible reason for decreased α was the rate of energy absorbed by the canopy decreased as the leaf senescence ding et al 2013 λet was mainly controlled by g c when the α value was lower than 1 0 lei and yang 2010 in this study the values of α table 2 were larger than 1 0 for the majority of the time during the growing periods for the four straight years indicating that most available energy was utilized by cucumber plants and λet was greatly influenced by r n 3 3 energy partitioning and its estimating hourly variations of energy fluxes at each growing stage for the four consecutive planting seasons 2018 2021 are presented in fig 4 in general energy components showed bell shaped curves through the day increasing rapidly along with sunrise reaching a peak near noon and decreasing afterward hourly r n varied from 32 46 to 486 13 w m 2 with a maximum of 355 61 and 486 13 w m 2 for the initial and middle growing stages respectively the λet ranged from 6 11 to 317 68 w m 2 and was approximately close to zero at night the proportions of energy fluxes in different growing stages are shown in table 3 the average ratio of λet to r n from 6 00 to 18 00 were 35 35 63 08 72 2 and 71 7 for the initial development middle and late growing stages respectively the h accounted for 49 53 27 98 22 1 and 22 43 of r n and varied from 25 51 to 181 48 45 84 to 152 6 29 51 to 134 17 and 38 83 to 139 8 w m 2 for the initial development middle and late growing stages respectively the measured hourly h was greater than λet at the midday of the initial stage and lower during other growing stages h reached a maximum around noon with the values of 181 48 152 6 134 17 and 139 8 w m 2 for respective growing stages the ratio of g to r ns f g 0 45 was substantially in agreement with the observations of choudhury et al 1987 f g 0 4 for spring wheat and fuchs et al 1972 f g 0 34 for a bare irrigated soil the g accounted for 15 28 10 2 6 53 and 5 9 of r n and varied from 17 65 to 58 61 1 13 to 35 67 2 97 to 25 71 and 1 58 to 23 62 w m 2 for the initial development middle and late growing stages respectively the λet r n increased rapidly from the initial to the middle growing stage and increased slightly in the late growing stage in contrast both averaged values of h r n and g r n generally decreased as the growing period progressed the maximum amounts of available energy r n g for the initial development middle and late growing stages were 347 87 437 51 430 27 and 413 61 w m 2 respectively to verify the accuracy of the estimated g a we reproduced h by eq 11 using data from 2018 to 2021 the comparison of estimated and measured h with varied g a was shown in fig 5 the results indicated that the estimated h was closely equivalent to the h obtained from the energy balance equation with measured λet with lysimeters as shown in table 4 the slope a of the linear relationships between measured and estimated h were 1 01 0 97 1 02 and 0 9 with the coefficient of determination r 2 of 0 85 0 86 0 87 and 0 84 in 2018 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively the bias were 0 04 0 09 0 12 and 0 03 the rmse were 34 17 33 85 30 81 and 31 46 w m 2 while the mae were 26 11 25 79 23 99 and 23 89 w m 2 in respective years since g a was the key parameter of the ω model the calibration of g a ensured the feasibility of the ω model in the prediction of λet in greenhouses according to the analysis of the relationship between daily ω and days after transplanting dat we found the daily ω was significantly correlated with dat and declined along with dat the daily maximum value of ω obtained in this study was 0 92 and maintained a value of 0 5 after 40 dat the calculated averaged ω values of the 0 40 and 40 90 dat from 2018 were used to estimate the λet of 2019 2021 by eq 8 to validate the accuracy of the estimated λet based on the ω model the comparison between measured and estimated λet was shown in fig 6 most of the regression points were scattered near the 1 1 line which indicated the measured λet could be represented by the ω model with good performance table 4 showed the statistical analysis indices between measured and estimated λet the slope a of the linear relationships between measured and estimated λet were 0 94 0 95 0 94 0 95 with the determination coefficient r 2 of 0 95 0 93 0 94 and 0 94 in 2018 2019 2020 and 2021 respectively the bias were 0 02 0 05 0 03 and 0 02 the rmse were 32 68 32 09 33 12 and 28 68 w m 2 while the mae were 26 13 25 19 25 31 and 26 12 w m 2 for the respective years 4 discussion 4 1 convection regimes in greenhouses the calculation of g a is the basis for determining energy fluxes in greenhouses and the classification of convection types which depends on the variations of gr re 2 is the key procedure to calculate g a in this study the variations of gr re 2 in the greenhouse were shown in fig 7 the data in fig 7 included different weather conditions sunny days may 4 9 and 12 cloudy days may 2 18 and 27 and rainy days may 6 15 and 21 in 2021 the gr re 2 remained stable at night and significantly changed during the daytime the gr re 2 values ranged from 0 1 to 10 for the majority of the time indicating the main convection type in the greenhouse was mixed convection which accounted for 75 6 of the whole growth period of cucumber the proportions of the forced and free convections were 16 5 and 7 8 respectively forced convection totally occurred in the daytime while free convection occurred in the night moreover the forced convection occurred in the daytime probably due to the opening ventilation system which resulted in high wind speed in the greenhouse different weather conditions led to different types of convection with free convection on sunny days and rarely on cloudy and rainy days fig 7 mixed convection occurred for the majority of the time during the whole growth period which was similar to the results obtained by gong et al 2021 for the greenhouse grown tomatoes in contrast qiu et al 2013 suggested that free convection occurred mainly during the night and early morning and no forced convection occurred in northwest china from the analysis of model parameters the main parameters that affected the type of convection in the greenhouse were the characteristic of a leaf the wind speed and the temperature difference between canopy and air therefore different regional climates greenhouse types and ventilation systems would influence these parameters and cause different results 4 2 physical and physiological controls of λet high decoupling coefficient ω values suggested a strong decoupling between canopy and environment indicating that there was a weak vapor transfer process over the cucumber canopy jiao et al 2018 tian et al 2017 liu et al 2019 the ω values for the initial growing stage were higher than 0 75 in this study a little change in stomatal conductance over the whole canopy would not contribute to any change in transpiration rate because of low lai and the λet was principally controlled by r n jarvis and mcnaughton 1986 at the beginning of the middle growing stage lai was large and potential transpiration tended to be high and water vapor transport gradually strengthened leading to lower values of ω gong et al 2021 because g a was low in the initial growing stage when λet was mainly controlled by r n katsoulas et al 2019 while during the middle growing stage increased g c had a greater influence on λet than in other growing stages the cucumber canopy tended to be coupled with the atmosphere than before and ω decreased slightly the values of ω table 2 were larger than 0 5 for most days of the whole growth period which indicated that r n was effective in driving λet rather than g c over greenhouse cucumber previous studies reported that different crops and environments had different ω values jiao et al 2018 found an averaged ω value of 0 3 for grapevine canopy in open fields and tolk et al 2006 pointed out that 0 5 was the usual value of ω in the semi arid cotton canopy ma et al 2015 illustrated that the ω ranged from 0 2 to 0 25 low ω and g c corroborated the overall water limited conditions for the highest alpine steppe zha et al 2013 found a close positive relationship between low ω and g c which indicated the et was sensitive to g c over a scots pine forest in eastern finland wullschleger et al 2000 found an average ω value of 0 23 which indicated that red maple canopies are partially decoupled from the atmosphere and the λet was mainly controlled by g c moreover jiang et al 2022 found the low ω over a humid region orchard which indicated that λet was strongly influenced by g c and the g c which was actually restricted by the soil water availability dominated the energy partition process a lack of moisture led to a significant decrease in stomatal conductance which constrained the release of λet high ω values were found in greenhouses probably because g a was much lower than that in open fields due to lower u crops were poorly coupled with the greenhouse atmosphere katsoulas et al 2019 in addition the ω model showed a good behavior in estimating λet the reason might not only be that the model had the advantage of taking into account the set of climatic variables r n and vpd but also the accurate determination of g a besides the ω model performed well in four planting seasons probably due to the sufficient radiation culminating in higher λet in the greenhouse the priestley taylor coefficient α for greenhouse cucumber gradually increased with the increase in lai and then slightly decreased during the late growing stage which was in agreement with the observations of lei et al 2010 for summer maize and qiu et al 2019 for winter wheat priestley and taylor 1972 suggested that 1 26 was regarded as a reference value for large wet ecosystems moreover gong et al 2021 reported that the α increased linearly with increasing in lai for greenhouse tomatoes since α was defined as the ratio of λet to λet eq the magnitude of α was determined by both λet and λet eq which was mainly controlled by r n as we discussed above the values of α were related to the r n received by the canopy which reacted to the amounts of lai in this study the values of α table 2 were larger than 1 0 for the majority of the time during the growing seasons which indicated that most available energy was adequately used by cucumber plants and other thermal components might provide extra energy for λet however previous research showed inconsistent results the α in this study was lower than that in rice paddy and maize fields liu et al 2019 and higher than in sparse grapevine fields jiao et al 2018 the reasons for different outcomes may be due to different climatic and environmental conditions planting density and field water capacity daily averaged canopy conductance g c ranged from 1 42 to 17 98 mm s 1 were found in this study and higher g c appeared during the middle growing stage for the four consecutive planting seasons similarly previous studies found that g c varied from 0 41 to 14 67 mm s 1 for greenhouse tomatoes gong et al 2021 and averaged g c value of 2 51 mm s 1 for sunflower canopy under the influence of soil salinity wang et al 2022 suyker and verma 2008 indicated that daily g c was 20 30 mm s 1 for an irrigated maize agroecosystem g c gradually increased as crops grew and had a greater effect on λet previous studies have shown the g c and ω were highly dependent on the soil moisture condition high g c and ω values appeared mainly during the wet period higher g c did not lead to higher canopy transpiration during the wet period compared to those in the dry periods in a lowland dipterocarp forest kumagai et al 2004 many studies have shown the relationship between α and g c jiao et al 2018 found a correlation between α and g c for grapevine canopy the values of α increased with the increase in g c and gradually kept constant when g c was over 15 mm s 1 indicating grapevine λet was more influenced by g c when g c was lower than the threshold of 15 mm s 1 gao et al 2018 pointed out that midday α during the growing season increased with the increasing midday g c until the g c reached the threshold of 8 mm s 1 in a spring maize field previous studies suggested different crops had various thresholds of g c ding et al 2013 lei and yang 2010 tian et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 indicating that λet of different crops was governed by either available energy or canopy conductance however in this study there was no specific threshold of g c probably because the daily value of α was larger than 1 0 for most of the time during the whole growth period and there was no obvious relationship between α and g c 4 3 energy partitioning during cucumber growing seasons solar radiation is a critical element to determine the energy balance of greenhouses considering the complicacy of mass and thermal transfer in the greenhouse previous studies had proposed some hypotheses including greenhouse structures steel frames and moist air do not absorb solar radiation and heat transfer between different substances of the greenhouses can be ignored takakura et al 2009 xu et al 2018 li et al 2020 in this study we analyzed energy components and partitioning based on a simplified energy balance equation under these hypotheses the r n is principally determined by solar radiation and is influenced by surface albedo allen et al 1998 the variation of r n is dominated by the difference between short wave and long wave incident solar radiation and the canopy architecture golkar et al 2018 bonachela et al 2020 the r n reached a maximum of 486 1 w m 2 during the daytime because of the high solar radiation and tended to zero in the late afternoon due to the absence of solar radiation and the low thermal radiation flux besides r n was negative at night because short wave solar radiation gradually became equivalent to long wave radiation from the underlying surface and short wave solar radiation decreased to zero over time at this time λet was larger than r n due to the occurrence of sensible heat advection which strengthened λet ding et al 2015 liu et al 2019 during the whole growth period the g was positive at midday and negative during the night the main reason for negative g was the thermal heat emitted upward from the soil surface at night in addition g was determined by the coverage of exposed soil g decreased as plant coverage increased and less energy was absorbed by the soil surface as canopy cover increased especially h was larger than λet at midday in the initial stage because the turbulent heat exchange between atmosphere and soil surface was significantly strong due to low canopy coverage as the crop grew more available energy was consumed by the cucumber plant λet accounted for 61 2 72 6 of r n which was the biggest consumption of r n during the whole growth period it is consistent with the results conducted by boulard et al 1993 for greenhouse tomatoes and tian et al 2017 for a cotton field however the λet for greenhouse grown cucumbers was lower than that for field grown cucumbers ertek et al 2006 we attributed this to the high rh and low u and in the greenhouse which might lead to low evaporative requirement harmanto et al 2005 in addition energy partition was significantly affected by the underlying coverage conditions which could be quantified as lai shen et al 2004 hammerle et al 2008 in this study the relationships between λet r n h r n g r n and lai were shown in fig 8 as lai increased λet r n increased while h r n and g r n decreased previous studies showed the same results in a vineyard sánchez et al 2019 and a greenhouse for hot peppers qiu et al 2011 particularly the g r n decreased exponentially as lai increased when lai was less than 4 m2 m 2 probably because the available energy would no longer be increasingly intercepted by the plant canopy when lai reached the effective threshold similar results were demonstrated by gong et al 2021 for greenhouse tomatoes 5 conclusion in this study we investigated the energy partition at different growing stages of cucumber in a venlo type greenhouse the convection modes were determined to calculate g a and the results indicated that mixed convection was the primary mode during the whole growth period in a venlo type greenhouse the physical α and ω and physiological g c factors were calculated to analyze their influences on λet the averaged values of both α 1 15 0 05 and ω 0 65 0 05 were high for most days in the growing seasons which indicated λet was principally influenced by r n the values of g c ranged from 1 42 to 17 98 mm s 1 and high g c values corresponded to high λet there was no obvious threshold of g c to distinguish the cucumber λet was governed by either available energy or canopy conductance the λet was the main component of r n accounting for 61 2 72 6 of r n over the whole growth period while followed by h 19 8 24 3 of r n and g 7 6 14 8 of r n the λet r n increased while both h r n and g r n decreased with the increase in lai the g r n decreased exponentially as lai increased when lai was less than 4 m2 m 2 the estimated and measured h was compared to calibrate g a the rmse and mae equaled 32 57 and 24 95 w m 2 the bias was 0 06 and the r 2 was 0 86 the λet could be estimated by the ω model with a good performance with the rmse and mae equaled 32 65 and 25 73 w m 2 the bias equaled 0 03 and the r 2 equaled 0 94 the simplified energy balance approach was an alternative way to analyze energy fluxes and partition in the greenhouse the statistical analysis revealed that the λet could be reproduced by the ω model with a good performance the predictions made in this study would be a relatively accurate and easy method to calculate cucumber energy fluxes in the greenhouse and thus the appropriate irrigation management could be built the findings in this study were based on long term observational data from the greenhouse and were considered representative of the venlo type greenhouse in order to confirm the transferability of our findings to other greenhouse types more research and further related analyses under different
