5510,accurate daily weather data are critical for hydrologic models simulating and predicting hydrologic processes many researchers have focused on the impacts of precipitation on hydrologic simulations but few studies integrated both temperature and precipitation data for historical and forecast periods in hydrologic models and evaluated the weather data accuracy at national scale this study evaluated four extracting methods mean mn median md centroid ct and area weighted aw approaches for summarizing weather data for sub watersheds defined in a hydrologic model firstly an optimized extracting method was used to develop a real time huc 12 12 digit hydrologic unit code level dataset for the conterminous united states the hydrologic model with the ct weather data performed the best followed by mn aw and then md secondly per this method a real time dataset including historical and forecast data at huc 12 level across the conterminous united states was created last continuous daily forecast data at national scale displayed that large forecast overestimations were usually observed in large forecast precipitation events over 20 mm simultaneously there were large underestimations in small forecast precipitation events less than 5 mm forecast maximum temperature showed a more substantial bias than that minimum temperature with the largest underestimation for the lower forecast maximum temperature less than 15 c with regard to data stability of the historical observed temperature data provisional and early temperature data from parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism in the most recent seven months are as reliable as the stable data that is subject to quality control measures before it replaces the provisional and early data however forecast data often included bias in the extreme weather conditions such as heavy precipitation and scorching temperature forecast data which is updated multiple times each day was frequently subject to an opposite bias trending toward less extreme values in the presence of strong frontal systems presumably due to the exact location and speed of the front being difficult to predict fully processed weather data from this work will be published online to facilitate hydrologic modeling efforts in the us and inform users about the uncertainty in the forecast data keywords swat climate prism nexrad forecast accuracy 1 introduction the conservation effects assessment project ceap is a national multiagency effort to quantify the environmental benefits of conservation practices across the conterminous united states us one crucial portion of this project is to use hydrologic models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 and agricultural policy extender apex williams et al 2002 to produce scientifically credible estimates of the effects and benefits of conservation practices over a range of scales in the previous ceap applications the most critical weather datasets for these hydrologic models were from a combination of daily land based station observations and monthly parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism predictions white et al 2017 as an ongoing effort previous ceap efforts at 8 digit hydrologic unit code huc 8 watersheds will be enhanced to 12 digit hydrologic unit code huc 12 watersheds with improved methods and greater spatial detail white et al 2017 this update requires redevelopment of all input data sources including daily weather data for the conterminous us at huc 12 level a huc 8 or huc 12 mentioned above describes the area of land upstream from a specific point on the stream generally the mouth or outlet that contributes surface water runoff directly to this outlet point every hydrologic unit the area of land upstream from a specific point is identified by a unique huc consisting of 2 12 digits based on the levels e g from 1st level with 2 digits to 6th level with 12 digits of classification in the hydrologic unit system the classification is using a hierarchical system of nesting hydrologic units at various scales each with an assigned hydrologic unit code huc hucs are delineated and georeferenced to u s geological survey usgs 1 24 000 scale topographic base maps according to compilation criteria monitored by the national subcommittee on spatial water data https water usgs gov gis huc html there already exists a national database of preprocessed climate data derived from monitoring stations applicable to huc 12 watersheds which was developed using a relatively simple method to choose one representative station for each huc 12 watershed in the us white et al 2017 to further improve the accuracy of weather data daily seamless gridded datasets such as parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism and next generation radar nexrad can be used as they have greater effective resolution than station based measurements also research has shown that they have a higher accuracy in representing weather conditions in small sub watersheds gao et al 2017 a high accuracy in rainfall input is important for simulating the spatial and temporal characteristics of hydrologic processes tao and barros 2013 therefore prism and nexrad datasets will be applied in current ceap applications to assess environmental impacts of conservation practices one ceap priority is to help conservationists farmers and ranchers make more informed conservation decisions a decision that directly impacts nutrient losses and water quality is the amount and timing of fertilizer and pesticide applications just after applications these chemicals are most susceptible to loss in runoff as these chemicals degrade adsorb infiltrate into the soil or are taken up by plants the susceptibility to loss is reduced ideally these chemicals should not be applied when significant runoff is expected in the next few days while producers can look to weather forecasts for precipitation precipitation does not necessarily generate runoff runoff depends on additional factors such as antecedent soil moisture soil type and land use all of which are considered in a hydrologic model like swat thus a real time ceap model was developed to predict future runoff amounts to guide the application of pesticides and fertilizers this model is based on the national agroecosystem model nam an ongoing effort by the usda ars and texas a m agrilife to develop a national huc 12 swat model using publicly available datasets white et al 2019 an important prerequisite for this work is to prepare the historical and forecast weather datasets for model applications at the national scale there are several approaches that can be used to extract representative weather data for a sub watershed from gridded data an area weighted method is the most common approach in hydrologic models gali et al 2012 gao et al 2017 price et al 2014 however model predictions may be significantly affected when using spatially aggregated data gao et al 2017 white et al 2017 few researchers analyzed the impacts of different extraction methods for weather data on its representativeness for a sub watershed and the associated hydrologic model performance to address this issue we applied four typical extraction methods area weighted aw mean mn median md and centroid ct and used the resulting precipitation and temperature time series to run a well calibrated hydrologic model that had been calibrated using area weighted weather data and to identify the best one of these four methods many adjustment methods have been developed and applied to improve quantitative precipitation estimates such as the probability matching method rosenfeld et al 1993 1994 mean field bias correction smith and krajewski 1991 steiner et al 1999 radar gauge merging methods seo 1998a b satellite gauge merging methods shi et al 2017 sun et al 2018 bai et al 2019 and local gauge bias correction seo et al 2000 seo and breidenbach 2002 in spite of the existing biases in quantitative precipitation estimation nexrad is the best choice for this application as observations are in the format of gridded surface datasets across the country kelly et al 2012 sexton et al 2010 in our case the datasets from prism and nexrad were taken as observations quantitative precipitation forecast data is available from the national digital forecast database ndfd a suite of gridded forecasts of sensible weather elements e g precipitation minimum and maximum temperature despite recent improvements in data assimilation and spatial resolution quantitative precipitation forecast skills at the lead times and spatial scales that closely affect hydrologic applications remain inadequate ebert and mcbride 2000 gourley et al 2012 tao and barros 2010 to improve the accuracy of flash flood forecasts quantitative precipitation estimates and quantitative precipitation forecasts were merged as a continuous weather input for elucidating the relationship between rainfall and the hydrologic processes that govern flash flood response in topographically complex regions tao and barros 2013 however few studies integrated both historical temperature and precipitation data with forecast data into a hydrologic model and this integration would also more accurately predict forecast in watersheds and the associated hydrologic response in lead time than incorporating only precipitation data many researches have analyzed accuracy of individual heavy precipitation events such as hurricanes and tropical cyclones impacting specific areas or watersheds saleh et al 2016 tao and barros 2013 zhang and weng 2015 however few studies evaluated the weather data accuracy at a national scale a priority for hydrologic models used in the ceap and real time ceap projects the primary goal of this study is to identify the best statistical method for extracting representative weather data at huc 12 level and to create a national scale real time dataset for real time ceap the specific objectives are to 1 evaluate the impacts of different methods to extract weather data on precipitation data and the associated hydrologic model performance 2 synthesize daily gridded datasets from prism temperature nexrad precipitation and forecast data to create a real time dataset suitable for the nam and the real time ceap project and 3 assess the accuracy of forecast datasets at national scale the processed weather data will be publicly available in the future to support other hydrologic modeling projects in the us 2 materials and methods 2 1 data sources climate data for the real time ceap could be constructed using point station observations individual grid cells spatially aggregated gridded data or aggregated point station observations prism and nexrad data were selected for this research as these datasets represent the largest source of observed daily surface measurements without significant gaps across the conterminous us in addition an research has demonstrated that prism and nexrad perform very well in representing the climate at sub watershed levels gao et al 2017 regarding forecast data it was obtained from the national digital forecast database ndfd developed by the nws prism was developed by the prism climate group at oregon state university and is recognized as the usda official climatological dataset wang et al 2006 schneider and ford jr 2011 prism products were created to address the spatially sparse coverage of the global historical climatology network daly 2006 daly et al 2008 by generating spatially and temporally continuous climate data throughout the conterminous us prism data is defined on a 2 5 min degree grid with a grid cell size of approximately 4 4 km schneider and ford jr 2011 the prism dataset uses a model that fits local linear regression curves of climate versus elevation with slopes that vary with elevation in which local regression accounts for spatially varying elevation relationships effectiveness of terrain as barriers terrain induced climate transitions cold air drainage and inversions and coastal effects daily prism data minimum temperature maximum temperature and precipitation are available online from the prism climate group repository daly 2006 daly et al 2008 nexrad data are developed from a network of 160 high resolution s band doppler weather radars in the us which detect precipitation and atmospheric movements or wind and return the estimated rainfall depth after raw data is processed it is provided in a gridded format similar to that of prism data nexrad has an increased emphasis on automation including the use of algorithms and automated volume scans multi sensor stage iii adjusted nexrad data derived from stage i data corrected by a bias adjustment factor based on available one hour rain gauge reports and stage ii data comprised of all radars combined into one map with ground truth data from gauge stations was used to extract precipitation in the conterminous us additional detailed information about nexrad products and processing algorithms can be found in the literature crum and alberty 1993 fulton et al 1998 moon et al 2004 the precipitation data are quality controlled multi sensor radar and rain gauge estimates obtained from national weather service nws river forecast centers rfcs and mosaicked by national centers for environmental prediction ncep the original data from ncep is in grib gridded binary or general regularly distributed information in binary form format and projected in the hydrologic rainfall analysis project hrap grid coordinate system a polar stereographic projection true at 60 n 105 w daily nexrad data from 2006 to march 22 2017 across the conterminous us can be obtained in shapefile and netcdf formats from http water weather gov a website of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s national weather service before 2006 the data was provided in xmrg format while the data after march 22 2017 can be downloaded in geotiff and netcdf formats the ndfd provides various weather element forecasts e g minimum and maximum temperature precipitation on a seamless grid covering the whole united states grib2 the second version of the world meteorological organization s wmo standard for distributing gridded data is the raw data format used a driver for the grib2 library known as degrib was developed by the meteorological development laboratory mdl to convert from grib2 to a more common file format such as esri shapefiles shp ascii comma separated files csv netcdf files and binary float files flt in our case the degrib was run from the command line to automatically download data detailed information on the data and tool can be found on the ndfd grib decoder website http www weather gov mdl degrib home 2 2 extracting representative weather data for sub watersheds 2 2 1 representative observed data the selection and processing of climatic data for use in hydrologic models is more complex than it may seem white et al 2017 point observations collected at discrete land based weather stations or remotely sensed grid data with interpolations or other calibrations are usually utilized as climate inputs for hydrologic models swat and apex are the models used for simulating the hydrology sediment and nutrients in the usda ceap across the conterminous us these models usually apply a single set of weather observations to an entire sub watershed thus it is important that these data are representative of climate condition in the entire sub watershed however there are not enough weather stations to assign one station for each sub watershed across the country especially for ncdc land based stations in our case many huc 12 watersheds have no weather station within their boundaries and must be represented by an exterior station that may be many kilometers away additionally data collected at a single site of land based station may be a poor representation for climate in a sub watershed due to lacking of a consideration of climate in the whole area white et al 2017 to improve the accuracy of data inputs for sub watersheds spatially gridded data sources e g prism and nexrad were selected as weather inputs to extract representative values for all sub watersheds four typical statistical methods including mean mn median md centroid ct and area weighted aw approaches were used to extract representative weather data for each sub watershed daily precipitation and temperature in the sub watershed were calculated based on the grid cells overlaid with a sub watershed via the four statistical methods mn md ct and aw mentioned above it is not possible to fully test the data but inferences can be drawn by applying the weather datasets extracted with the four statistical approaches to a hydrologic model examining the output and comparing it to monitoring data in this study we used a well calibrated swat model for the smoky hill river shr in kansas usa during calibration the model was driven by a weather dataset extracted from prism using the aw approach detailed information about this model is provided by gao et al 2017 in this study monthly streamflow observed at usgs station 06864050 smoky hill river near bunker hill kansas located on the lower reaches of the shr was compared to monthly swat simulated flow during the years 2005 through 2010 four statistical assessment indexes r2 nse rsr and pbias were used to analyze the impacts of the different resulting weather datasets created by ct mn aw and md on model performance 2 2 2 representative forecast data extracting forecast data including daily precipitation minimum and maximum temperature for all huc 12 watersheds was conducted using the tool degrib it was run via a command line to download temperature and precipitation data across the conterminous us the tool degrib was selected because it is simple and computationally efficient to download and decipher the grib2 format data subsequently a python script was used to convert 6 hour interval data into daily values and each huc 12 centroid was defined as a weather station for this huc the ndfd data were used to construct future three day records at huc 12 level the spatial resolution of the ndfd grids was 2 5 km or finer precipitation predicted by the ndfd was referred to as 6 hour quantitative precipitation forecast qpf6 the expected amount of liquid precipitation in hundredths of inches accumulated over a 6 hour period the ndfd valid periods are six hours in length beginning and ending at 0600 1200 1800 and 0000 coordinated universal time utc qpf6 grids will be valid each 6 hour period out to 72 h from 00 utc day 1 accumulated precipitation in 24 h from 12 utc to 12 utc in the following day was summarized as daily predicted precipitation maximum and minimum temperature grids from the ndfd are valid for each 24 hour period out to 168 h from 00 utc day 1 three days of forecast data starting from the day after the last historical observation were appended to the historical observation records as a full weather input for the future hydrologic model simulations in real time ceap 2 3 updating the schedule for the whole real time datasets to support the development of the real time ceap model 86 024 data points were created to represent the average weather for all huc 12 watersheds in the conterminous us data processing software for the real time ceap model is executed on a dedicated server using the windows task scheduler nexrad precipitation data is scheduled to be updated every day at 16 30 utc forecast data four times every day at 17 00 23 00 05 00 and 11 00 utc and temperature data from prism every day at 13 00 utc fig 1 there are three types of prism data available stable provisional and early the data older than six months within the last 1 6 months and in the current month are referred to as stable provisional and early data respectively detailed information about the three categories can be found on the prism website http www prism oregonstate edu explorer in this case to update provisional and early data in a timely manner two months of data will be updated at the beginning of each month including replacing one month of provisional data by stable data and one month of early data by provisional data 3 results and discussion 3 1 identifying the best method to extract weather data for swat the swat model with weather data extracted by the ct method displayed a better capability in capturing the flow peaks than the models involving the other three extraction methods fig 2 a also there were the highest nse and r2 and the lowest rsr and pbias resulted by ct method fig 2b compared with other three methods it indicates a better model performance from the swat driven by data from the ct method than the ones by the weather data extracted using the mn aw and md methods although the pbias for the aw model was slightly lower than that for the mn model the other three indexes indicated better performance of the mn than the aw model accordingly mn can be considered slightly more useful especially since the aw method is more complex than the mn method all extraction methods have the potential to inadequately represent the weather condition in a sub watershed but the one that would be able to mostly represent the condition was expected in this case the ct and md methods resulted in less modification of the statistical nature of the weather events than the aw and mn methods white et al 2017 the centroid is typically located at low elevation along the central valley of a drainage basin furthest from the watershed divides at the subbasin boundary these lowland areas are often agricultural which is a focus of the ceap effort and rainfall here is assumed to be more meaningful than a median value also median values often underestimate rainfall due to many zeros or a skewed distribution in precipitation see example in fig 3 at all grid cells in a sub watershed in our case the swat model used was built for a watershed in the central great plains the most rainfall events happen in summer during highly variable convective thunderstorms wang and chen 2009 along with a widely spanned longitude range about 4 in the shr which leads to a large spatial variation of precipitation in a sub watershed there could be some areas without rain while other areas experience heavy rain in a sub watershed when a convective thunderstorm occurred it would lead to an underestimation of overall precipitation amounts when calculating the median of all nexrad cells in a sub watershed due to too many zero values this was clearly indicated by the high negative pbais for the swat model using the md weather data the aw and mn methods are expected to introduce less bias in precipitation in a sub watershed than the md method as they clip high values by averaging all cells in the sub watershed it is important to note that the swat model we used for this case study was calibrated with aw weather data nevertheless swat performed better with the data created by the ct method and model performance is expected to be even better if the calibration was conducted with ct weather data 3 2 impacts of selecting statistical methods on weather condition in sub watersheds to evaluate the effects of alternative statistical methods on identifying representative weather for typical precipitation patterns in the watershed three sub watersheds corresponding to huc 12 level of the shr watershed with minimum min sub median med sub and maximum max sub annul precipitation were compared fig 4 the probabilities of precipitation exceedance for the four approaches were used to analyze the impacts of various precipitation events on exceedance probability in the watershed fig 1 in all three sub watersheds there was no significant difference among the four methods for monthly precipitation amounts below about 75 mm however the monthly precipitation extracted with the ct method presented the largest probability of exceedance for the events more than 75 mm 120 mm and 150 mm in max sub med sub and min sub the lowest exceedance probability in monthly precipitation was displayed when the md method was adopted followed by using the aw and mn methods the main reason was that when using the md method zero value grid cells in some sub watershed in precipitation events resulted in an underestimation of the exceedance probability the aw and mn methods also reduced event signals by averaging operation and resulted in a similarity in their exceedance curves since there were less than 20 nexrad cells in a sub watershed the ct method was usually able to capture the precipitation events the results from the three sub watersheds suggested that the difference in precipitation exceedance among using the four methods are more pronounced in dry areas than in wet areas the largest values are predicted by the ct method and the smallest by the md method accordingly modelers should be very cautious when selecting an appropriate extraction method in dry areas with an average monthly precipitation over 100 mm 3 3 accuracy of precipitation and temperature at national scale accurate forecasting of precipitation requires good predictions of the occurrence timing and location of the events and it was even a greater challenge to forecast the precipitation amount jankov and gallus 2004 in this study three days of forecast data were integrated with historical data to create continuous input datasets for hydrologic models to predict real time and future water sediment and nutrition conditions in the watersheds to evaluate the spatial accuracy of the three day forecast data they were compared to the prism and nexrad weather data for the same days june 14 2018 and the following three days of data were taken as an example fig 5 precipitation forecast data displayed less effective spatial resolution than nexrad observations despite using the same grid cell size while temperature forecasts were more similar in pattern to observations this is expected as it is very difficult to accurately predict localized precipitation amounts even a few hours in advance especially with highly variable small convective weather systems rezacova et al 2007 also had the similar conclusion that the reliable forecasting of local convective storms is extremely hard in terms of good quantitative forecast this conclusion was also closely related the model they were using which was incapable of reproducing a detailed scenario of the spatial and temporal life cycle of storm dynamic and microphysics in our case the accuracy of these three days of forecast data were assessed by calculating the difference between forecast and observed data retrospectively fig 6 differences in spatial precipitation indicate that the largest forecast overestimations were usually observed in regions with large forecast precipitation events over 20 mm e g wisconsin on june 15 2018 there were large underestimations detected in areas with forecast precipitation events less than 5 mm e g iowa on june 15 2018 regarding the spatial distribution of significant bias in precipitation extreme precipitation forecast is better over the western and northeastern states and is poorer over the central and southeastern regions likely due to the domination of convective events in the central and south eastern regions in summer sukovich et al 2014 this suggested that users should be cautious when using forecast precipitation to evaluate extreme weather conditions this is similar to the statement that seasonal extreme precipitation forecast data shows the lowest skill during summer by the previous research sukovich et al 2014 the limited predictability of an extreme precipitation event practically and intrinsically displayed a need for probabilistic forecasts zhang et al 2006 in addition a research displayed that to develop multisensory precipitation analyses that integrate the satellite based estimates radar based analyses and in situ rain gauge measurements will be a future trend via a multi spectral multi sensory algorithm for estimating precipitation scofield and kuligowski 2003 however there is also a considerable uncertainty in nexrad data several studies have reported underestimations and overestimations when using nexrad in their applications gali et al 2012 gao et al 2017 zhang and srinivasan 2010 there was a larger bias in maximum than in minimum temperature for forecast data fig 6 as reported by the previous research huntemann et al 2015 taking june 16 2018 for an example larger forecast underestimations for maximum temperatures were observed in areas with forecast maximum temperatures less than 15 c and a bias more than 3 c such as observed in utah colorado arizona and new mexico however larger forecast overestimations were found in great lakes region with forecast maximum temperatures more than 31 c and a bias more than 6 c such as wisconsin and michigan it s interesting that no other areas were found with a significant overestimation where forecast maximum temperatures were more than 31 c in these three days this difference was mainly caused by lake induced reductions in maximum temperatures in the region scott and huff 1996 the similar phenomenon that minimum temperature in this region was overestimated was displayed in the great lakes region fig 6 both indicated that temperature predictions from ndfd forecast data should be further improved in this particular area compared to the bias in forecast maximum temperature the bias in forecast minimum temperature was much lower within a range from 6 c to 6 c fig 6 this suggested that forecast minimum temperature has a higher accuracy than maximum temperature which is similar to the results from a previous research huntemann et al 2015 as lead time increases from june 15 to june 17 2018 in our case there is an overall trend of more areas involved with overestimations for maximum and minimum temperature with decreasing underestimations and increasing overestimations in areas fig 6 the meteorological development laboratory mdl of the national weather service nws had applied the model output statistics mos approach to the ecmwf model ecmwf mos to enhance its usefulness to nws forecasters due to ecmwf s better accuracy rudack et al 2014 this result is consistent with the conclusion based on this approach that forecast data from ndfd consistently presents less accurate than that from ecmwf mos as lead time increases huntemann et al 2015 additionally more variations including under and over estimation in spatial were revealed in our case for the human generated forecasts they sometimes failed to outperform the most skillful downscaled bias corrected ensemble guidance for precipitation and maximum temperature available near the same time as the human modified forecasts thus as additional downscaled and bias corrected sensible weather element guidance becomes operationally available and with the support of near real time verification forecaster training and tools to guide forecaster interventions a key test is whether forecasters can learn to make statistically significant improvements over the most skillful of this guidance novak et al 2014 3 4 stability in observation and forecast datasets 3 4 1 variations in historical observed datasets with each update nexrad provides only one type of observed data so a data stability assessment for historical data was only conducted for the prism temperature data taking huc12 120702011106 for an example seven months of unstable temperature data six months of provisional data and one month of early data from december 2018 to june 2019 were compared to stable temperature data for the same time period fig 7 this work updated in january 2019 enabled us to collect the stable data from december to june 2019 due to the latest released stable data available difference between provisional early data and stable data for maximum and minimum temperatures was shown in fig 7 to obtain a good indication of the difference spreading out box whisker plots were added into the figure there are five number summaries in plots minimum first quartile q1 median third quartile q3 and maximum in the plot as well as an interquartile range iqr q3 q1 as box whisker plots show in fig 7 about 99 3 values on the difference e g from minimum summary q1 1 5 iqr to maximum summary q3 1 5 iqr are within an range from 0 23 to 0 18 c and from 0 50 c to 0 44 c for maximum and minimum temperature respectively this indicated that the early and provisional data for both minimum and maximum temperature are reliable enough to be used as climate data inputs for hydrologic models 3 4 2 forecast datasets with increased lead times for forecast data from ndfd each day of weather forecast data is usually updated 12 4 times 3 days times within three days in our real time program to reveal the stability of these forecasts in three days one of four updates 13 00 utc was picked to compare it with the observations on that day in the example used in this study three times of precipitation and temperature forecasts called forecast 1 2 and 3 were released on august 10 11 and 12 2018 each of the three times of forecasts includes forecast data for three days day 1 2 and 3 fig 8 compares the forecasts for august 13 i e day 3 of forecast 1 day 2 of forecast 2 and day 1 of forecast 3 to the precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature observed on that day august 13 with regard to precipitation the differences between forecast and observed precipitation fell within a range from 1 to 1 mm in 82 17 80 85 and 81 12 of the total area in forecasts 1 2 and 3 respectively the largest underestimation 7 mm was observed for large precipitation events red hotspots in forecasts 1 2 and 3 in fig 8 while overestimation 7 mm was generally observed for small events green areas in the left side of hotspots in fig 8 following large events since the precipitation belt moved from west to east the most obvious differences were found in the areas around this storm event marked in hotspots the smallest area 5 03 with an underestimation 7 mm was observed for forecast 1 followed by forecast 2 5 05 and then forecast 3 5 11 the areas with overestimation more 7 mm account for 2 74 smallest area of the whole country in forecast 1 followed by forecast 3 4 47 and then forecast 2 4 61 there were underestimations in term of the net balances on that day in the whole country with 2 30 0 43 and 0 64 in forecasts 1 2 and 3 respectively this result is consistent with the previous report about ndfd datasets that there is a high confidence in the first two days of predictions and a medium confidence in third day of forecast horel and colman 2005 another research also revealed a similar result that extreme precipitation forecast skill decreases with increased lead time sukovich et al 2014 in addition we evaluated forecast data performance in probability of detection precipitation podp at huc 12 level which is a verification metric used to check if forecast is able to capture precipitation events the results showed that podps in the three forecasts exhibited similar accuracies of 70 72 and 71 in predicting precipitation events on august 13 2018 the ndfd performance in spatial shows that the highest accuracy is over the western and northern united states while the lowest accuracy is distributed in the southern eastern and southeastern regions this distribution pattern for ndfd performance is very close to that from the previous findings sukovich et al 2014 the major reason is that there are many convective scale extreme events challenging forecast in these regions zhang et al 2006 sukovich et al 2014 the only region upper midwest is different from the previous report which mainly was caused by no precipitation events occurring in this region in our example we will select some days with storms occurring around this region in the future as targeted tests to further validate forecast data regarding the temperature maximum and minimum a general tendency for lower temperatures to be overestimated and higher temperatures to be underestimated is obvious in these three days forecasts this point is similar to the conclusion from the previous research myrick and horel 2006 as for maximum temperature the percentage of area with an absolute difference range from 4 to 4 c in the forecasts 1 2 and 3 was 84 28 84 01 and 84 46 of the whole country the percentages for minimum temperature were much higher with values of 96 96 97 47 and 97 36 in the three forecasts fig 8 as noted by a previous research myrick and horel 2006 higher accuracy in maximum temperature usually observed in afternoon forecast was evident during the morning compared with minimum temperature recorded in the afternoon however the lower accuracy in spatial were found for extreme maximum temperatures e g the highest in montana and north dakota and the lowest in washington and texas indicating that it should be cautious to evaluate the performance of maximum temperature forecast by a single statistical index in the whole country the most significant bias in forecast maximum temperature was an underestimation 10 c in the areas with the highest observed maximum temperature green hotspots in forecasts 1 2 and 3 in fig 8 while overestimation 10 c was generally observed in the areas with the lowest observed maximum temperature e g red areas in the pacific northwest and in storm events it is evident that the arctic outbreak in montana and north dakota was underestimated even including the onset of the arctic push into wyoming as reported by a previous research myrick and horel 2006 it is also noteworthy that overestimation in maximum temperature was always associated with underestimation in precipitation such as areas with underestimation in precipitation as shown in hotspots e g texas suggesting that there is a close relationship in forecasting maximum temperature and precipitation similar to the forecast precipitation bias in three forecasts the smallest area with an underestimation in minimum temperature was observed in forecast 1 followed by forecast 3 and then forecast 2 there was a consistent slight overestimation of over 4 c in forecast minimum temperature 2 71 2 27 and 2 39 of the whole country in forecast 1 2 and 3 the most noticeable overestimation was observed in areas with the lowest minimum temperature as demonstrated by the minimum temperature hotspots in the pacific northwest especially in oregon other study also found the lower forecast accuracy overestimation in this region during the winter season myrick and horel 2006 in general the most bias in the forecasts was observed in extreme weather conditions such as heavy precipitation and scorching temperatures a completely opposite bias was often recognized in the front and back of an event as it moves in space along with a slightly different pattern of bias for the three forecasts major reason is that it is more difficult to analyze these storms with a longer persistence in some areas given present analysis capabilities myrick and horel 2006 there might exist some bias in the prism nexrad observations but many researches have indicated that they are the most reliable weather data products currently available at large scale gao et al 2017 hamedi and fuentes 2015 4 conclusions weather data are critical input data for hydrologic models in this work an optimized method for extracting grid based weather data was selected for use in a sub watershed based swat model we developed a framework to produce a real time dataset at huc 12 level across the conterminous united states for hydrologic models and assessed the accuracy of these datasets among four extracting methods the swat model with the weather data extracted using the centroid method performed the best followed by the mean area weighted and median methods the centroid method presented a higher probability of exceedance in monthly precipitation than the area weighted and mean methods which showed a similar probability of exceedance curve and the median method differences between observed and forecast precipitation showed that the largest forecast underestimations were usually observed for large precipitation events over 20 mm simultaneously there were larger overestimations in the smaller precipitation events less than 5 mm forecasts of maximum temperature showed a more obvious bias than forecasts of minimum temperature specifically the largest forecast underestimations for maximum temperature were observed for maximum temperatures of less than 15 c with regard to historical weather data both the provisional and early released temperature datasets in the previous seven months provide reliable observed datasets to represent climate in hydrologic models however forecast datasets often include bias in the extreme weather conditions such as heavy precipitation and scorching temperatures a completely opposite bias was frequently found before and after an event as it moves in space along with a slightly different forecast bias for three forecasts the purpose of this work was to develop a real time dataset to meet the needs of a specific modeling application this dataset will not only help users to know the uncertainty in the forecast data and adopt an appropriate strategy to deal with the uncertainty but also provide real time weather data

5510,accurate daily weather data are critical for hydrologic models simulating and predicting hydrologic processes many researchers have focused on the impacts of precipitation on hydrologic simulations but few studies integrated both temperature and precipitation data for historical and forecast periods in hydrologic models and evaluated the weather data accuracy at national scale this study evaluated four extracting methods mean mn median md centroid ct and area weighted aw approaches for summarizing weather data for sub watersheds defined in a hydrologic model firstly an optimized extracting method was used to develop a real time huc 12 12 digit hydrologic unit code level dataset for the conterminous united states the hydrologic model with the ct weather data performed the best followed by mn aw and then md secondly per this method a real time dataset including historical and forecast data at huc 12 level across the conterminous united states was created last continuous daily forecast data at national scale displayed that large forecast overestimations were usually observed in large forecast precipitation events over 20 mm simultaneously there were large underestimations in small forecast precipitation events less than 5 mm forecast maximum temperature showed a more substantial bias than that minimum temperature with the largest underestimation for the lower forecast maximum temperature less than 15 c with regard to data stability of the historical observed temperature data provisional and early temperature data from parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism in the most recent seven months are as reliable as the stable data that is subject to quality control measures before it replaces the provisional and early data however forecast data often included bias in the extreme weather conditions such as heavy precipitation and scorching temperature forecast data which is updated multiple times each day was frequently subject to an opposite bias trending toward less extreme values in the presence of strong frontal systems presumably due to the exact location and speed of the front being difficult to predict fully processed weather data from this work will be published online to facilitate hydrologic modeling efforts in the us and inform users about the uncertainty in the forecast data keywords swat climate prism nexrad forecast accuracy 1 introduction the conservation effects assessment project ceap is a national multiagency effort to quantify the environmental benefits of conservation practices across the conterminous united states us one crucial portion of this project is to use hydrologic models such as the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 and agricultural policy extender apex williams et al 2002 to produce scientifically credible estimates of the effects and benefits of conservation practices over a range of scales in the previous ceap applications the most critical weather datasets for these hydrologic models were from a combination of daily land based station observations and monthly parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism predictions white et al 2017 as an ongoing effort previous ceap efforts at 8 digit hydrologic unit code huc 8 watersheds will be enhanced to 12 digit hydrologic unit code huc 12 watersheds with improved methods and greater spatial detail white et al 2017 this update requires redevelopment of all input data sources including daily weather data for the conterminous us at huc 12 level a huc 8 or huc 12 mentioned above describes the area of land upstream from a specific point on the stream generally the mouth or outlet that contributes surface water runoff directly to this outlet point every hydrologic unit the area of land upstream from a specific point is identified by a unique huc consisting of 2 12 digits based on the levels e g from 1st level with 2 digits to 6th level with 12 digits of classification in the hydrologic unit system the classification is using a hierarchical system of nesting hydrologic units at various scales each with an assigned hydrologic unit code huc hucs are delineated and georeferenced to u s geological survey usgs 1 24 000 scale topographic base maps according to compilation criteria monitored by the national subcommittee on spatial water data https water usgs gov gis huc html there already exists a national database of preprocessed climate data derived from monitoring stations applicable to huc 12 watersheds which was developed using a relatively simple method to choose one representative station for each huc 12 watershed in the us white et al 2017 to further improve the accuracy of weather data daily seamless gridded datasets such as parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism and next generation radar nexrad can be used as they have greater effective resolution than station based measurements also research has shown that they have a higher accuracy in representing weather conditions in small sub watersheds gao et al 2017 a high accuracy in rainfall input is important for simulating the spatial and temporal characteristics of hydrologic processes tao and barros 2013 therefore prism and nexrad datasets will be applied in current ceap applications to assess environmental impacts of conservation practices one ceap priority is to help conservationists farmers and ranchers make more informed conservation decisions a decision that directly impacts nutrient losses and water quality is the amount and timing of fertilizer and pesticide applications just after applications these chemicals are most susceptible to loss in runoff as these chemicals degrade adsorb infiltrate into the soil or are taken up by plants the susceptibility to loss is reduced ideally these chemicals should not be applied when significant runoff is expected in the next few days while producers can look to weather forecasts for precipitation precipitation does not necessarily generate runoff runoff depends on additional factors such as antecedent soil moisture soil type and land use all of which are considered in a hydrologic model like swat thus a real time ceap model was developed to predict future runoff amounts to guide the application of pesticides and fertilizers this model is based on the national agroecosystem model nam an ongoing effort by the usda ars and texas a m agrilife to develop a national huc 12 swat model using publicly available datasets white et al 2019 an important prerequisite for this work is to prepare the historical and forecast weather datasets for model applications at the national scale there are several approaches that can be used to extract representative weather data for a sub watershed from gridded data an area weighted method is the most common approach in hydrologic models gali et al 2012 gao et al 2017 price et al 2014 however model predictions may be significantly affected when using spatially aggregated data gao et al 2017 white et al 2017 few researchers analyzed the impacts of different extraction methods for weather data on its representativeness for a sub watershed and the associated hydrologic model performance to address this issue we applied four typical extraction methods area weighted aw mean mn median md and centroid ct and used the resulting precipitation and temperature time series to run a well calibrated hydrologic model that had been calibrated using area weighted weather data and to identify the best one of these four methods many adjustment methods have been developed and applied to improve quantitative precipitation estimates such as the probability matching method rosenfeld et al 1993 1994 mean field bias correction smith and krajewski 1991 steiner et al 1999 radar gauge merging methods seo 1998a b satellite gauge merging methods shi et al 2017 sun et al 2018 bai et al 2019 and local gauge bias correction seo et al 2000 seo and breidenbach 2002 in spite of the existing biases in quantitative precipitation estimation nexrad is the best choice for this application as observations are in the format of gridded surface datasets across the country kelly et al 2012 sexton et al 2010 in our case the datasets from prism and nexrad were taken as observations quantitative precipitation forecast data is available from the national digital forecast database ndfd a suite of gridded forecasts of sensible weather elements e g precipitation minimum and maximum temperature despite recent improvements in data assimilation and spatial resolution quantitative precipitation forecast skills at the lead times and spatial scales that closely affect hydrologic applications remain inadequate ebert and mcbride 2000 gourley et al 2012 tao and barros 2010 to improve the accuracy of flash flood forecasts quantitative precipitation estimates and quantitative precipitation forecasts were merged as a continuous weather input for elucidating the relationship between rainfall and the hydrologic processes that govern flash flood response in topographically complex regions tao and barros 2013 however few studies integrated both historical temperature and precipitation data with forecast data into a hydrologic model and this integration would also more accurately predict forecast in watersheds and the associated hydrologic response in lead time than incorporating only precipitation data many researches have analyzed accuracy of individual heavy precipitation events such as hurricanes and tropical cyclones impacting specific areas or watersheds saleh et al 2016 tao and barros 2013 zhang and weng 2015 however few studies evaluated the weather data accuracy at a national scale a priority for hydrologic models used in the ceap and real time ceap projects the primary goal of this study is to identify the best statistical method for extracting representative weather data at huc 12 level and to create a national scale real time dataset for real time ceap the specific objectives are to 1 evaluate the impacts of different methods to extract weather data on precipitation data and the associated hydrologic model performance 2 synthesize daily gridded datasets from prism temperature nexrad precipitation and forecast data to create a real time dataset suitable for the nam and the real time ceap project and 3 assess the accuracy of forecast datasets at national scale the processed weather data will be publicly available in the future to support other hydrologic modeling projects in the us 2 materials and methods 2 1 data sources climate data for the real time ceap could be constructed using point station observations individual grid cells spatially aggregated gridded data or aggregated point station observations prism and nexrad data were selected for this research as these datasets represent the largest source of observed daily surface measurements without significant gaps across the conterminous us in addition an research has demonstrated that prism and nexrad perform very well in representing the climate at sub watershed levels gao et al 2017 regarding forecast data it was obtained from the national digital forecast database ndfd developed by the nws prism was developed by the prism climate group at oregon state university and is recognized as the usda official climatological dataset wang et al 2006 schneider and ford jr 2011 prism products were created to address the spatially sparse coverage of the global historical climatology network daly 2006 daly et al 2008 by generating spatially and temporally continuous climate data throughout the conterminous us prism data is defined on a 2 5 min degree grid with a grid cell size of approximately 4 4 km schneider and ford jr 2011 the prism dataset uses a model that fits local linear regression curves of climate versus elevation with slopes that vary with elevation in which local regression accounts for spatially varying elevation relationships effectiveness of terrain as barriers terrain induced climate transitions cold air drainage and inversions and coastal effects daily prism data minimum temperature maximum temperature and precipitation are available online from the prism climate group repository daly 2006 daly et al 2008 nexrad data are developed from a network of 160 high resolution s band doppler weather radars in the us which detect precipitation and atmospheric movements or wind and return the estimated rainfall depth after raw data is processed it is provided in a gridded format similar to that of prism data nexrad has an increased emphasis on automation including the use of algorithms and automated volume scans multi sensor stage iii adjusted nexrad data derived from stage i data corrected by a bias adjustment factor based on available one hour rain gauge reports and stage ii data comprised of all radars combined into one map with ground truth data from gauge stations was used to extract precipitation in the conterminous us additional detailed information about nexrad products and processing algorithms can be found in the literature crum and alberty 1993 fulton et al 1998 moon et al 2004 the precipitation data are quality controlled multi sensor radar and rain gauge estimates obtained from national weather service nws river forecast centers rfcs and mosaicked by national centers for environmental prediction ncep the original data from ncep is in grib gridded binary or general regularly distributed information in binary form format and projected in the hydrologic rainfall analysis project hrap grid coordinate system a polar stereographic projection true at 60 n 105 w daily nexrad data from 2006 to march 22 2017 across the conterminous us can be obtained in shapefile and netcdf formats from http water weather gov a website of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s national weather service before 2006 the data was provided in xmrg format while the data after march 22 2017 can be downloaded in geotiff and netcdf formats the ndfd provides various weather element forecasts e g minimum and maximum temperature precipitation on a seamless grid covering the whole united states grib2 the second version of the world meteorological organization s wmo standard for distributing gridded data is the raw data format used a driver for the grib2 library known as degrib was developed by the meteorological development laboratory mdl to convert from grib2 to a more common file format such as esri shapefiles shp ascii comma separated files csv netcdf files and binary float files flt in our case the degrib was run from the command line to automatically download data detailed information on the data and tool can be found on the ndfd grib decoder website http www weather gov mdl degrib home 2 2 extracting representative weather data for sub watersheds 2 2 1 representative observed data the selection and processing of climatic data for use in hydrologic models is more complex than it may seem white et al 2017 point observations collected at discrete land based weather stations or remotely sensed grid data with interpolations or other calibrations are usually utilized as climate inputs for hydrologic models swat and apex are the models used for simulating the hydrology sediment and nutrients in the usda ceap across the conterminous us these models usually apply a single set of weather observations to an entire sub watershed thus it is important that these data are representative of climate condition in the entire sub watershed however there are not enough weather stations to assign one station for each sub watershed across the country especially for ncdc land based stations in our case many huc 12 watersheds have no weather station within their boundaries and must be represented by an exterior station that may be many kilometers away additionally data collected at a single site of land based station may be a poor representation for climate in a sub watershed due to lacking of a consideration of climate in the whole area white et al 2017 to improve the accuracy of data inputs for sub watersheds spatially gridded data sources e g prism and nexrad were selected as weather inputs to extract representative values for all sub watersheds four typical statistical methods including mean mn median md centroid ct and area weighted aw approaches were used to extract representative weather data for each sub watershed daily precipitation and temperature in the sub watershed were calculated based on the grid cells overlaid with a sub watershed via the four statistical methods mn md ct and aw mentioned above it is not possible to fully test the data but inferences can be drawn by applying the weather datasets extracted with the four statistical approaches to a hydrologic model examining the output and comparing it to monitoring data in this study we used a well calibrated swat model for the smoky hill river shr in kansas usa during calibration the model was driven by a weather dataset extracted from prism using the aw approach detailed information about this model is provided by gao et al 2017 in this study monthly streamflow observed at usgs station 06864050 smoky hill river near bunker hill kansas located on the lower reaches of the shr was compared to monthly swat simulated flow during the years 2005 through 2010 four statistical assessment indexes r2 nse rsr and pbias were used to analyze the impacts of the different resulting weather datasets created by ct mn aw and md on model performance 2 2 2 representative forecast data extracting forecast data including daily precipitation minimum and maximum temperature for all huc 12 watersheds was conducted using the tool degrib it was run via a command line to download temperature and precipitation data across the conterminous us the tool degrib was selected because it is simple and computationally efficient to download and decipher the grib2 format data subsequently a python script was used to convert 6 hour interval data into daily values and each huc 12 centroid was defined as a weather station for this huc the ndfd data were used to construct future three day records at huc 12 level the spatial resolution of the ndfd grids was 2 5 km or finer precipitation predicted by the ndfd was referred to as 6 hour quantitative precipitation forecast qpf6 the expected amount of liquid precipitation in hundredths of inches accumulated over a 6 hour period the ndfd valid periods are six hours in length beginning and ending at 0600 1200 1800 and 0000 coordinated universal time utc qpf6 grids will be valid each 6 hour period out to 72 h from 00 utc day 1 accumulated precipitation in 24 h from 12 utc to 12 utc in the following day was summarized as daily predicted precipitation maximum and minimum temperature grids from the ndfd are valid for each 24 hour period out to 168 h from 00 utc day 1 three days of forecast data starting from the day after the last historical observation were appended to the historical observation records as a full weather input for the future hydrologic model simulations in real time ceap 2 3 updating the schedule for the whole real time datasets to support the development of the real time ceap model 86 024 data points were created to represent the average weather for all huc 12 watersheds in the conterminous us data processing software for the real time ceap model is executed on a dedicated server using the windows task scheduler nexrad precipitation data is scheduled to be updated every day at 16 30 utc forecast data four times every day at 17 00 23 00 05 00 and 11 00 utc and temperature data from prism every day at 13 00 utc fig 1 there are three types of prism data available stable provisional and early the data older than six months within the last 1 6 months and in the current month are referred to as stable provisional and early data respectively detailed information about the three categories can be found on the prism website http www prism oregonstate edu explorer in this case to update provisional and early data in a timely manner two months of data will be updated at the beginning of each month including replacing one month of provisional data by stable data and one month of early data by provisional data 3 results and discussion 3 1 identifying the best method to extract weather data for swat the swat model with weather data extracted by the ct method displayed a better capability in capturing the flow peaks than the models involving the other three extraction methods fig 2 a also there were the highest nse and r2 and the lowest rsr and pbias resulted by ct method fig 2b compared with other three methods it indicates a better model performance from the swat driven by data from the ct method than the ones by the weather data extracted using the mn aw and md methods although the pbias for the aw model was slightly lower than that for the mn model the other three indexes indicated better performance of the mn than the aw model accordingly mn can be considered slightly more useful especially since the aw method is more complex than the mn method all extraction methods have the potential to inadequately represent the weather condition in a sub watershed but the one that would be able to mostly represent the condition was expected in this case the ct and md methods resulted in less modification of the statistical nature of the weather events than the aw and mn methods white et al 2017 the centroid is typically located at low elevation along the central valley of a drainage basin furthest from the watershed divides at the subbasin boundary these lowland areas are often agricultural which is a focus of the ceap effort and rainfall here is assumed to be more meaningful than a median value also median values often underestimate rainfall due to many zeros or a skewed distribution in precipitation see example in fig 3 at all grid cells in a sub watershed in our case the swat model used was built for a watershed in the central great plains the most rainfall events happen in summer during highly variable convective thunderstorms wang and chen 2009 along with a widely spanned longitude range about 4 in the shr which leads to a large spatial variation of precipitation in a sub watershed there could be some areas without rain while other areas experience heavy rain in a sub watershed when a convective thunderstorm occurred it would lead to an underestimation of overall precipitation amounts when calculating the median of all nexrad cells in a sub watershed due to too many zero values this was clearly indicated by the high negative pbais for the swat model using the md weather data the aw and mn methods are expected to introduce less bias in precipitation in a sub watershed than the md method as they clip high values by averaging all cells in the sub watershed it is important to note that the swat model we used for this case study was calibrated with aw weather data nevertheless swat performed better with the data created by the ct method and model performance is expected to be even better if the calibration was conducted with ct weather data 3 2 impacts of selecting statistical methods on weather condition in sub watersheds to evaluate the effects of alternative statistical methods on identifying representative weather for typical precipitation patterns in the watershed three sub watersheds corresponding to huc 12 level of the shr watershed with minimum min sub median med sub and maximum max sub annul precipitation were compared fig 4 the probabilities of precipitation exceedance for the four approaches were used to analyze the impacts of various precipitation events on exceedance probability in the watershed fig 1 in all three sub watersheds there was no significant difference among the four methods for monthly precipitation amounts below about 75 mm however the monthly precipitation extracted with the ct method presented the largest probability of exceedance for the events more than 75 mm 120 mm and 150 mm in max sub med sub and min sub the lowest exceedance probability in monthly precipitation was displayed when the md method was adopted followed by using the aw and mn methods the main reason was that when using the md method zero value grid cells in some sub watershed in precipitation events resulted in an underestimation of the exceedance probability the aw and mn methods also reduced event signals by averaging operation and resulted in a similarity in their exceedance curves since there were less than 20 nexrad cells in a sub watershed the ct method was usually able to capture the precipitation events the results from the three sub watersheds suggested that the difference in precipitation exceedance among using the four methods are more pronounced in dry areas than in wet areas the largest values are predicted by the ct method and the smallest by the md method accordingly modelers should be very cautious when selecting an appropriate extraction method in dry areas with an average monthly precipitation over 100 mm 3 3 accuracy of precipitation and temperature at national scale accurate forecasting of precipitation requires good predictions of the occurrence timing and location of the events and it was even a greater challenge to forecast the precipitation amount jankov and gallus 2004 in this study three days of forecast data were integrated with historical data to create continuous input datasets for hydrologic models to predict real time and future water sediment and nutrition conditions in the watersheds to evaluate the spatial accuracy of the three day forecast data they were compared to the prism and nexrad weather data for the same days june 14 2018 and the following three days of data were taken as an example fig 5 precipitation forecast data displayed less effective spatial resolution than nexrad observations despite using the same grid cell size while temperature forecasts were more similar in pattern to observations this is expected as it is very difficult to accurately predict localized precipitation amounts even a few hours in advance especially with highly variable small convective weather systems rezacova et al 2007 also had the similar conclusion that the reliable forecasting of local convective storms is extremely hard in terms of good quantitative forecast this conclusion was also closely related the model they were using which was incapable of reproducing a detailed scenario of the spatial and temporal life cycle of storm dynamic and microphysics in our case the accuracy of these three days of forecast data were assessed by calculating the difference between forecast and observed data retrospectively fig 6 differences in spatial precipitation indicate that the largest forecast overestimations were usually observed in regions with large forecast precipitation events over 20 mm e g wisconsin on june 15 2018 there were large underestimations detected in areas with forecast precipitation events less than 5 mm e g iowa on june 15 2018 regarding the spatial distribution of significant bias in precipitation extreme precipitation forecast is better over the western and northeastern states and is poorer over the central and southeastern regions likely due to the domination of convective events in the central and south eastern regions in summer sukovich et al 2014 this suggested that users should be cautious when using forecast precipitation to evaluate extreme weather conditions this is similar to the statement that seasonal extreme precipitation forecast data shows the lowest skill during summer by the previous research sukovich et al 2014 the limited predictability of an extreme precipitation event practically and intrinsically displayed a need for probabilistic forecasts zhang et al 2006 in addition a research displayed that to develop multisensory precipitation analyses that integrate the satellite based estimates radar based analyses and in situ rain gauge measurements will be a future trend via a multi spectral multi sensory algorithm for estimating precipitation scofield and kuligowski 2003 however there is also a considerable uncertainty in nexrad data several studies have reported underestimations and overestimations when using nexrad in their applications gali et al 2012 gao et al 2017 zhang and srinivasan 2010 there was a larger bias in maximum than in minimum temperature for forecast data fig 6 as reported by the previous research huntemann et al 2015 taking june 16 2018 for an example larger forecast underestimations for maximum temperatures were observed in areas with forecast maximum temperatures less than 15 c and a bias more than 3 c such as observed in utah colorado arizona and new mexico however larger forecast overestimations were found in great lakes region with forecast maximum temperatures more than 31 c and a bias more than 6 c such as wisconsin and michigan it s interesting that no other areas were found with a significant overestimation where forecast maximum temperatures were more than 31 c in these three days this difference was mainly caused by lake induced reductions in maximum temperatures in the region scott and huff 1996 the similar phenomenon that minimum temperature in this region was overestimated was displayed in the great lakes region fig 6 both indicated that temperature predictions from ndfd forecast data should be further improved in this particular area compared to the bias in forecast maximum temperature the bias in forecast minimum temperature was much lower within a range from 6 c to 6 c fig 6 this suggested that forecast minimum temperature has a higher accuracy than maximum temperature which is similar to the results from a previous research huntemann et al 2015 as lead time increases from june 15 to june 17 2018 in our case there is an overall trend of more areas involved with overestimations for maximum and minimum temperature with decreasing underestimations and increasing overestimations in areas fig 6 the meteorological development laboratory mdl of the national weather service nws had applied the model output statistics mos approach to the ecmwf model ecmwf mos to enhance its usefulness to nws forecasters due to ecmwf s better accuracy rudack et al 2014 this result is consistent with the conclusion based on this approach that forecast data from ndfd consistently presents less accurate than that from ecmwf mos as lead time increases huntemann et al 2015 additionally more variations including under and over estimation in spatial were revealed in our case for the human generated forecasts they sometimes failed to outperform the most skillful downscaled bias corrected ensemble guidance for precipitation and maximum temperature available near the same time as the human modified forecasts thus as additional downscaled and bias corrected sensible weather element guidance becomes operationally available and with the support of near real time verification forecaster training and tools to guide forecaster interventions a key test is whether forecasters can learn to make statistically significant improvements over the most skillful of this guidance novak et al 2014 3 4 stability in observation and forecast datasets 3 4 1 variations in historical observed datasets with each update nexrad provides only one type of observed data so a data stability assessment for historical data was only conducted for the prism temperature data taking huc12 120702011106 for an example seven months of unstable temperature data six months of provisional data and one month of early data from december 2018 to june 2019 were compared to stable temperature data for the same time period fig 7 this work updated in january 2019 enabled us to collect the stable data from december to june 2019 due to the latest released stable data available difference between provisional early data and stable data for maximum and minimum temperatures was shown in fig 7 to obtain a good indication of the difference spreading out box whisker plots were added into the figure there are five number summaries in plots minimum first quartile q1 median third quartile q3 and maximum in the plot as well as an interquartile range iqr q3 q1 as box whisker plots show in fig 7 about 99 3 values on the difference e g from minimum summary q1 1 5 iqr to maximum summary q3 1 5 iqr are within an range from 0 23 to 0 18 c and from 0 50 c to 0 44 c for maximum and minimum temperature respectively this indicated that the early and provisional data for both minimum and maximum temperature are reliable enough to be used as climate data inputs for hydrologic models 3 4 2 forecast datasets with increased lead times for forecast data from ndfd each day of weather forecast data is usually updated 12 4 times 3 days times within three days in our real time program to reveal the stability of these forecasts in three days one of four updates 13 00 utc was picked to compare it with the observations on that day in the example used in this study three times of precipitation and temperature forecasts called forecast 1 2 and 3 were released on august 10 11 and 12 2018 each of the three times of forecasts includes forecast data for three days day 1 2 and 3 fig 8 compares the forecasts for august 13 i e day 3 of forecast 1 day 2 of forecast 2 and day 1 of forecast 3 to the precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature observed on that day august 13 with regard to precipitation the differences between forecast and observed precipitation fell within a range from 1 to 1 mm in 82 17 80 85 and 81 12 of the total area in forecasts 1 2 and 3 respectively the largest underestimation 7 mm was observed for large precipitation events red hotspots in forecasts 1 2 and 3 in fig 8 while overestimation 7 mm was generally observed for small events green areas in the left side of hotspots in fig 8 following large events since the precipitation belt moved from west to east the most obvious differences were found in the areas around this storm event marked in hotspots the smallest area 5 03 with an underestimation 7 mm was observed for forecast 1 followed by forecast 2 5 05 and then forecast 3 5 11 the areas with overestimation more 7 mm account for 2 74 smallest area of the whole country in forecast 1 followed by forecast 3 4 47 and then forecast 2 4 61 there were underestimations in term of the net balances on that day in the whole country with 2 30 0 43 and 0 64 in forecasts 1 2 and 3 respectively this result is consistent with the previous report about ndfd datasets that there is a high confidence in the first two days of predictions and a medium confidence in third day of forecast horel and colman 2005 another research also revealed a similar result that extreme precipitation forecast skill decreases with increased lead time sukovich et al 2014 in addition we evaluated forecast data performance in probability of detection precipitation podp at huc 12 level which is a verification metric used to check if forecast is able to capture precipitation events the results showed that podps in the three forecasts exhibited similar accuracies of 70 72 and 71 in predicting precipitation events on august 13 2018 the ndfd performance in spatial shows that the highest accuracy is over the western and northern united states while the lowest accuracy is distributed in the southern eastern and southeastern regions this distribution pattern for ndfd performance is very close to that from the previous findings sukovich et al 2014 the major reason is that there are many convective scale extreme events challenging forecast in these regions zhang et al 2006 sukovich et al 2014 the only region upper midwest is different from the previous report which mainly was caused by no precipitation events occurring in this region in our example we will select some days with storms occurring around this region in the future as targeted tests to further validate forecast data regarding the temperature maximum and minimum a general tendency for lower temperatures to be overestimated and higher temperatures to be underestimated is obvious in these three days forecasts this point is similar to the conclusion from the previous research myrick and horel 2006 as for maximum temperature the percentage of area with an absolute difference range from 4 to 4 c in the forecasts 1 2 and 3 was 84 28 84 01 and 84 46 of the whole country the percentages for minimum temperature were much higher with values of 96 96 97 47 and 97 36 in the three forecasts fig 8 as noted by a previous research myrick and horel 2006 higher accuracy in maximum temperature usually observed in afternoon forecast was evident during the morning compared with minimum temperature recorded in the afternoon however the lower accuracy in spatial were found for extreme maximum temperatures e g the highest in montana and north dakota and the lowest in washington and texas indicating that it should be cautious to evaluate the performance of maximum temperature forecast by a single statistical index in the whole country the most significant bias in forecast maximum temperature was an underestimation 10 c in the areas with the highest observed maximum temperature green hotspots in forecasts 1 2 and 3 in fig 8 while overestimation 10 c was generally observed in the areas with the lowest observed maximum temperature e g red areas in the pacific northwest and in storm events it is evident that the arctic outbreak in montana and north dakota was underestimated even including the onset of the arctic push into wyoming as reported by a previous research myrick and horel 2006 it is also noteworthy that overestimation in maximum temperature was always associated with underestimation in precipitation such as areas with underestimation in precipitation as shown in hotspots e g texas suggesting that there is a close relationship in forecasting maximum temperature and precipitation similar to the forecast precipitation bias in three forecasts the smallest area with an underestimation in minimum temperature was observed in forecast 1 followed by forecast 3 and then forecast 2 there was a consistent slight overestimation of over 4 c in forecast minimum temperature 2 71 2 27 and 2 39 of the whole country in forecast 1 2 and 3 the most noticeable overestimation was observed in areas with the lowest minimum temperature as demonstrated by the minimum temperature hotspots in the pacific northwest especially in oregon other study also found the lower forecast accuracy overestimation in this region during the winter season myrick and horel 2006 in general the most bias in the forecasts was observed in extreme weather conditions such as heavy precipitation and scorching temperatures a completely opposite bias was often recognized in the front and back of an event as it moves in space along with a slightly different pattern of bias for the three forecasts major reason is that it is more difficult to analyze these storms with a longer persistence in some areas given present analysis capabilities myrick and horel 2006 there might exist some bias in the prism nexrad observations but many researches have indicated that they are the most reliable weather data products currently available at large scale gao et al 2017 hamedi and fuentes 2015 4 conclusions weather data are critical input data for hydrologic models in this work an optimized method for extracting grid based weather data was selected for use in a sub watershed based swat model we developed a framework to produce a real time dataset at huc 12 level across the conterminous united states for hydrologic models and assessed the accuracy of these datasets among four extracting methods the swat model with the weather data extracted using the centroid method performed the best followed by the mean area weighted and median methods the centroid method presented a higher probability of exceedance in monthly precipitation than the area weighted and mean methods which showed a similar probability of exceedance curve and the median method differences between observed and forecast precipitation showed that the largest forecast underestimations were usually observed for large precipitation events over 20 mm simultaneously there were larger overestimations in the smaller precipitation events less than 5 mm forecasts of maximum temperature showed a more obvious bias than forecasts of minimum temperature specifically the largest forecast underestimations for maximum temperature were observed for maximum temperatures of less than 15 c with regard to historical weather data both the provisional and early released temperature datasets in the previous seven months provide reliable observed datasets to represent climate in hydrologic models however forecast datasets often include bias in the extreme weather conditions such as heavy precipitation and scorching temperatures a completely opposite bias was frequently found before and after an event as it moves in space along with a slightly different forecast bias for three forecasts the purpose of this work was to develop a real time dataset to meet the needs of a specific modeling application this dataset will not only help users to know the uncertainty in the forecast data and adopt an appropriate strategy to deal with the uncertainty but also provide real time weather data

5511,tide dominated estuaries are often characterized by a high variability of turbulent shear suspended particulate matter spm concentration and salinity which poses challenges for a comprehensive understanding of its mass transport including cohesive sediment dynamics here a combined in situ and numerical study was undertaken to investigate the mechanism of flocculation during tidal cycles with the aim to disentangle the impacts of turbulent shear spm concentration and salinity on flocs results show that microflocs 20 200 μm dominate in the pearl river estuary and floc size variation is caused primarily by exchange between flocculi 4 20 μm and microflocs we also identified a critical shear rate g 5 s below which floc exchange occurs slowly above the threshold the particle size distribution is left skewed and clustered below 60 μm evolutions of flocs with different initial sizes synchronize gradually to adapt to the local hydrological environment the trends of floc size evolution and absolute net flocculation rates are similar among diverse tidal shear cycles the reason can be attributed to the turbulent shear which enhances both aggregation and breakup processes thereby limiting the floc size in a certain range the higher the concentration the larger both the particle size and the range of variation in addition results of numerical modelling reveal that the flocculation time for primary particles is inversely proportional to shear and concentration a critical concentration c 50 mg l below which the impact of concentration on the equilibrium diameter of flocs is more than twice as strong as shear whilst above which the equilibrium diameter is inversely proportional to the kolmogorov microscale and weakly correlated to concentration was also identified furthermore halocline was found to increase vertical variation of flocs size suggesting co existence of different flocculation mechanisms across this layer abbreviations adcp acoustic

winterwerp and kesteren 2004 a floc is a micro ecosystem comprising a matrix of water inorganic sediment particles and organic materials with autonomous and interactive physical chemical and

water mass transport e g in tide dominated estuaries characterized by simultaneously high variability of turbulent shear g spm concentration c and salinity s in each tidal cycle impedes a comprehensive understanding of flocculation mechanisms in natural waters thomas et al 1999 the impacts of two dominant factors i e c and g on flocculation characteristics such as floc size d rates of aggregation and breakup equilibrium diameter d e representing the floc size when aggregation and break up are balanced and flocculation time t f representing the time required to attain d e from an initial floc size d 0 under steady concentration and shear conditions have yet to be quantified explicitly in situ winterwerp 1998 guo et al 2017 it has been found that the evolution trend of d is determined by d e flocs tend to grow when d d e and break when d d e in addition t f defines the maximal timescale of flocculation process winterwerp 1998 the impact of g on d has been explored extensively in most previous studies a critical shear rate representing an optimal condition for flocculation below which the floc size increases with g and above which the floc size declines with an increasing g has been identified dyer 1989 mietta et al 2009 kumar et al 2010 value of this critical shear rate has been found to range around 15 40 s manning and dyer 1999 kumar et al 2010 sahin 2014 zhang et al 2019b large flocs 200 μm are supposed to form in slack water with reduced g guo et al 2017 accordingly the particle size distributions psds of flocs are skewed toward larger sizes under low turbulent shear and vice versa lee et al 2012 moreover d e is inversely proportional to the kolmogorov microscale η bowers et al 2007 cross et al 2013 however quantitative assessment of the impact of g on d in natural estuaries is still lacking because of the impact of various interacting environmental factors and forces which often lead to non equilibrium status of d in response to changing g winterwerp 1998 previous research indicates that the influence of c on d is not as straightforward as that proposed by classic aggregation theory especially on the assumption that higher concentration increases floc size because of enhanced inter particle collisions hill 1998 for example c is found to enhance flocculation when turbulence decreases guo et al 2018 but has limited effect in promoting macrofloc i e d 200 μm formation li et al 2017 d responds quickly to a decrease in c i e from 400 mg l to 50 mg l but d e has a weak positive correlation with c when g is at a medium level e g g 50 s tran et al 2018 these results suggest that the relationship between c and d is corrugated by g a further limitation in current understanding of flocculation is the relationship between t f c and g t f is usually used to estimate whether an equilibrium status could be achieved in a settling column maggi et al 2002 the measured maximum floc size could be locally maintained only if t f exceeds the floc residence time cuthbertson et al 2010 an increase in g is supposed to shorten t f through increasing both aggregation and breakup rates mietta et al 2009 he et al 2018 an analytical solution of t f can be obtained based on the winterwerp flocculation model winterwerp 1998 2002 by relating t f to d e c and g however the model has been further developed to be more applicable kuprenas et al 2018 specifically a more precise formulation of t f is desirable besides a dominant control by c and g the impact of salinity including salinity induced stratification such as front or halocline on flocculation could not be neglected in estuarine environments ren and wu 2014 an increase in salinity is supposed to enhance flocculation as salt would decrease the particles surface charge mietta et al 2009 however based on in situ observations contradictory results have been derived with regard to the impact of an increasing salinity on floc size burt 1986 eisma et al 1991 van leussen 1999 a consensus about the role of salinity is that there exists an optimum salinity for flocculation however its value is dependent on the specific environmental and spm lithologic configuration shen and maa 2016 guo et al 2017 it is difficult to measure the exact rates of simultaneous aggregation and breakup and to investigate flocculation mechanism in situ due to constantly changing c and or g and or s instead these rates could be estimated by numerical models that fit observed distribution of flocs and then the model could help predict transport and fate of fine grained suspended cohesive sediments shen and maa 2015 2016 thus development of robust numerical models which could resolve the complex interactions between flocculation and its controlling factors is of critical importance in general three types of flocculation model exist the first is based on the extended lattice boltzmann model which is able to predict a full spectrum of flocs properties such as psds and settling velocities but on the other hand is highly expensive in terms of computational cost zhang et al 2013 the second type is the population balance modeling which represents psds with two or multiple size groups classes maggi et al 2007 lee et al 2011 2014 shen and maa 2015 2016 shen et al 2018a the third type refers to the winterwerp flocculation model which traces the evolution of a characteristic floc size and describes the relevant aggregation and breakup processes the winterwerp flocculation model is widely used because of its high computational efficiency and easy integration into hydrodynamics models winterwerp 1998 2002 winterwerp and kesteren 2004 kuprenas et al 2018 based on in situ measurements in the pearl river estuary and numerical modelling results this study aims to further advance the understanding of flocculation processes by 1 modelling the flocculation process in response to changing c and g in tidal cycle 2 assessing the quantitative impact of c and g on the equilibrium diameter d e and flocculation time t f exploring 3 the response of floc size d aggregation and breakup rates to initial particle diameter d 0 c and g and 4 the impact of salinity induced stratification halocline on flocculation 2 materials and methods 2 1 regional setting and field measurements the study area is located in the pearl river estuary situated in south china fig 1 hydrodynamics of this area is mainly controlled by semidiurnal tides with obvious salinity velocity and turbidity cycles the mean annual loads of freshwater and riverine sediment are approximately 2 86 1011 m3 and 3 04 107 t respectively zhang et al 2019a two sites with contrasting salinity conditions namely b1 which is affected mainly by freshwater flow and b2 which is featured by periodic salt water intrusion following a tidal cycle were selected to investigate flocculation processes fig 1 field work recording psds turbulence velocity turbidity and salinity was conducted continuously covering two full semi diurnal tides between august 24 25 2018 and august 25 26 2018 at the two sites respectively in situ psds of volume equivalent spherical particles in 36 logarithmically spaced size groups over the range 1 500 μm were measured using the lisst 200x laser in situ scattering and transmissiometry instrument agrawal and pottsmith 2000 which is valid for spm concentrations from 20 mg l to 1000 mg l fettweis et al 2006 guo et al 2017 the salinity temperature and turbidity were measured using an obs 3a optical backscatterance sensor the device was connected online so that the depths of interest e g surface middle and bottom layers or thin layer boundary layer halocline thermocline can be located by real time transmitted data the lisst 200x and obs 3a were installed in a steel frame that was deployed at an hourly interval in each deployment it was firstly lowered from the water surface to the bottom in a steady speed of 0 1 m s then the device stayed in the bottom middle where the halocline was located and surface layers by turn where they remained for approximately 5 min each with sampling frequency of 1 hz meanwhile water samples were collected and filtered by preweighed filters for calibration of turbidity and spm concentration values bottom sediment samples were also collected for analysis of the size of primary particles using a malvern mastersizer 3000 which covers a size range of 0 01 3500 μm in addition an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv and 5 beam acoustic doppler current profiler adcp were mounted on a benthic tripod and deployed at each site turbulence data were collected by the adv 64 hz located at 0 55 m above the bed the vertical current structure was measured by the upward looking adcp which operated at 8 hz in twelve bins 50 cm interval with 5 min bursts in every 10 min 2 2 data processing 2 2 1 lisst data four steps were performed to obtain the psd of each layer these include 1 data inversion 2 quality control 3 spike removal and 4 ensemble averaging in the first step small angle scattering data were inverted into psd data using a matlab inversion script http www sequoiasci com in the step of quality control optical transmission within a range of 0 15 0 98 was considered to indicate good quality data agrawal and pottsmith 2000 the third step spike removal was essential to eliminate both the effects of short term variations and the influence of advection vertical sediment transport and outliers of the psds mikkelsen and pejrup 2001 we applied the method of local outlier factor detection by breunig et al 2000 which is implemented in python to remove spikes of particle size from the time series of the median particle diameter d 50 after this step covariance of the ensemble d 50 was reduced significantly e g to 1 2 of the pre processing value in surface layer at site b1 in the final step the psds of each layer were averaged for each hourly ensemble to produce representative psds 2 2 2 decomposition of multimodal psds generally the psds of flocs in a coastal zone can be decomposed into four lognormal size classes to represent primary particles 0 4 μm flocculi 4 20 μm microflocs 20 200 μm and macroflocs 200 500 μm lee et al 2012 hussein et al 2005 mäkelä et al 2000 whitey 2007 given by 1 dv dd i 1 4 v i 2 π l n σ i exp 1 2 ln d d i l n σ i 2 where v and d are the volumetric concentration and diameter of each size interval of the lisst 200x measured psds respectively dv dd is the volumetric fraction normalized by the width of the size interval that is used for curve fitting to a lognormal distribution hinds 1999 and d i σ i and v i eq 1 are the representative size standard deviation and volumetric concentration respectively of the i th lognormal psd i 1 2 3 4 the mean diameters of the four size classes were derived as curve fitting parameters based on observation here σ was limited to 2 5 to prevent unrealistically wide psds fettweis et al 2012 a mean value of σ 1 63 was obtained in our observation the curve fitting tool implemented in python http www scipy org was used to determine the best fit to a measured psd i e the minimum error between the simulated and measured psds lee et al 2012 the quality of the curve fitting analysis was monitored with absolute percentage error defined as the ratio between the sum of errors and experimental data 2 2 3 turbulence data turbulent shear rate g is defined as g v η 2 ε v s where v is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid η is the kolmogorov microscale and ε is the mean turbulent energy dissipation rate g was estimated from the high frequency velocity data recorded by the adv the adv derived raw data requires preprocessing before turbulent parameters can be estimated a robust nonparametric technique that can identify outliers thompson 1985 lanzante 1996 was used to remove spikes from the fluctuating velocity time series afterwards the turbulence kinetic energy tke spectra method guerra and thomson 2017 was applied to estimate ε 2 s w f α ε 2 3 f 5 3 u 2 π 2 3 where s w is the tke spectra f is the frequency α is a constant 0 69 sreenivasan 1995 and u is the mean along channel velocity the tke spectra method is based on the kolmogorov hypothesis i e there exist a range of turbulent length scales within the isotropic turbulence energy cascade known as the inertial subrange in which energy transfer is determined solely by the dissipation rate kolmogorov 1941 pope 2000 however the inertial subrange is variable due to changes in the hydrological factors this poses a challenge on solving the dissipation rate to derive a precise inertial subrange a three step procedure was applied in this study firstly each estimated spectrum was multiplied by f 5 3 to obtain a compensated spectrum which should be horizontal flat in the presence of an inertial subrange the dissipation rate was estimated by solving eq 3 3 s w f f 5 3 f 2 f 1 α ε 2 3 u 2 π 2 3 where f1 and f2 indicate the lower and upper frequency limit of the compensated spectrum respectively guerra and thomson 2017 the range of frequencies varies for different mean flows between 2 f 10 hz in our observation secondly the frequency range e g 2 10 hz was divided into intervals e g 0 2 hz so that the subrange collection was obtained by permutation and combination the frequency band of each subrange was required to be no less than 2 hz to provide sufficient integral spectrum data the final step is to search the optimal subrange criteria for defining the best subrange include a the error between the compensated spectrum and its robust regression is sufficiently small e g 30 percentile b the slope of the robust regression is sufficiently close to zero e g 10 percentile c afterwards sufficient integral spectrum data remain for the calculation e g 50 percentile and d then the slope of the robust regression is the closest to zero 2 3 numerical modelling of flocculation the winterwerp 1998 model referred to w98 hereafter is a simple lagrangian type floc growth equation used to predict the temporal evolution of a single characteristic floc size it reflects how factors such as shear concentration floc structure and the inherited floc size act on the aggregation and breakup rates specifically it is a rate equation for an average floc size d expressed as 4 dd dt a b where a and b are the aggregation and breakup kernels respectively expressed in dimensions of l t a and b are calculated by a k a n f d p n f 3 ρ s g c d 4 n f 5 b k b n f d g d d p d p p τ t τ y q where d p is the size of the primary particles n f is the floc fractal dimension ρ s is the density of the unflocculated sediment and p and q are nondimensional power coefficients in the floc erosion kernel k a is a dimensionless aggregation coefficient defined as k a 3 e c π e d 2 f s where f s is a floc shape factor and e c and e d are efficiency parameters for coagulation and diffusion respectively e c is an empirical parameter related to the physicochemical properties of the sediment and the water as well as the organic compounds within the sediment van leussen 1994 k b is an empirical coefficient of floc breakup efficiency τ t is the turbulence induced stress on the floc and τ y is the strength of the floc they are calculated by τ t μ g 6 τ y f y d 2 where μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid and f y is the floc yield strength in the dimension of force winterwerp 1998 proposed that p 3 n f based on the assumptions that d p d e and d e 1 g bowers et al 2007 cross et al 2013 q 0 5 is adopted to satisfy that settling velocity ω d uncertainty in the coefficients k a and k b related to the spm concentration limits the use of the w98 model for predictive modeling as an alternative kuprenas et al 2018 modified the coefficient q of the w98 floc breakup rate kernel referred to k18 hereafter as follows 7 q c 1 c 2 d η where c 1 and c 2 are constant coefficients this simple modification limits the size of the floc to the kolmogorov microscale η thereby improving the time dependent solution behavior without requiring recalibration coefficients for every change of concentration the key state variables in k18 model include the particle size the mass spm concentration and the turbulent shear in this study time series of these variables derived from field observation were fed into the model to evaluate the flocculation process the parameters setting used to explore the psds evolution in tidal cycles was as follows n f 2 f y 1e 10 n ρ s 2650 kg m3 p 3 n f c 1 0 5 c 2 1 5 and d p 5 μm according to the malvern measurements zhang et al 2019b the initial particle size d 0 was set to the size of the measured floc at the beginning t 1 μ was calculated based on in situ temperature and salinity data g was derived from the adv and c was determined from obs after calibration more details about the choice of these parameters and its sensitivity analysis could be found in kuprenas et al 2018 3 results 3 1 hydrodynamic conditions the field survey sites b1 and b2 fig 1 were in shallow water with average depth of approximately 3 3 and 5 0 m and mean spm concentration of approximately 30 and 40 mg l respectively fig 2 the semi diurnal tides were asymmetric and ebb dominant the maximum vertically averaged ebb flow velocity at b1 and b2 was 0 51 and 1 13 m s respectively fig 2a and d at site b1 the variations of channel velocity salinity and mass concentration were almost consistent throughout the entire water column fig 2a c fresh water dominated here with salinity mostly 2 practical salinity units psu however the arrival of a density front at high water of the flood tide at 22 h caused an abrupt change characterized by a drastic rise of salinity up to 5 psu fig 2b and a large vertical gradient of spm concentration near the seabed fig 2c site b2 was further offshore and the water mass there was notably different from site b1 site b2 was dominated by saline water 20 4 psu characterized by a halocline near the surface fig 2e the vertical structure of velocity varied widely e g strong currents were confined mainly at the surface but sometimes penetrated into the middle layer fig 2d it is worth to note that an exceptionally high spm concentration event 200 mg l occurred at 6 h during the monitoring period near the seabed at this site fig 2f 3 2 psd variation 3 2 1 vertical structure of psds at high low shear rate profiles of high shear fig 3 a at 4 h referred to hs hereafter and low shear fig 3b at 8 h referred to ls hereafter at site b1 with the same salinity structure and similar concentration range were selected for analysis the vertical average diameter of hs 37 μm was significantly smaller than ls 60 μm the psd of hs was centered around 22 μm with significant positive skewness whereas that of ls was centered around 66 μm with slightly negative skewness microflocs with a mean diameter of 31 μm dominated in hs accounting for 74 2 of the total volume of particles while macroflocs with a mean diameter of 370 μm accounted for only 0 9 fig 3a in ls the fractions of microflocs and macroflocs were 56 4 and 11 8 with mean diameters of 88 6 and 376 μm respectively fig 3b these findings confirm that particle size is generally smaller in stronger shear environment in addition floc size increased slightly from the surface towards the bottom layer the mean diameter of the microflocs in the surface middle and bottom layers was 29 6 28 0 and 35 6 μm respectively in hs and 71 6 82 5 and 111 9 μm respectively in ls furthermore the transformations of the psds in the vertical axis were not as gradual and smooth as turbidity or salinity fig 3 on the contrary they were characterized by abrupt and jagged changes fig 3b due to the reason that the transformation of floc size is caused by particle collisions rather than by diffusive movements strong correlation was found between mass concentration and volume concentration with r 0 74 in hs and 0 68 in ls this indicated that the density of flocs was vertically uniform at site b1 3 2 2 psds in different layers at characteristic times at site b1 in peak flood at 11 h and ebb at 4 h flows the vertical mean diameters were 37 6 and 25 4 μm respectively fig 4 c and g the psds of the three layers surface middle and bottom were similar in both flood and ebb peak flows e g with primary particles flocculi microflocs and macroflocs accounting for 6 4 0 5 26 6 67 6 and 0 75 0 25 respectively however the mean diameter in slack waters was notably larger than that in peak flows with values of 70 37 and 40 12 μm in the flood to ebb slack water at 13 h and ebb to flood slack water at 9 h respectively fig 4e and i in addition psd in slack waters was broader especially in the surface layer which exhibited a dual peak concentrated around 5 and 66 μm these results indicate that flocculation prevails over deflocculation in a low shear environment i e g 1 s in slack water and vice versa the psds at site b2 in the middle and bottom layers showed similar patterns with site b1 but differed significantly in the surface layer during the peak flow periods the portion of macroflocs in the surface layer at b2 accounted for 25 and 65 for the flood at 16 h and ebb at 25 h respectively fig 4d and h while during slack water a right skewed psd appeared there sediment resuspension was enhanced during the ebb peak flow at 25 h with near surface concentration up to 36 mg l compared to the values during the slack waters both around 22 mg l the short lasting but intense resuspension at 6h induced not only an increase of spm concentration but also a drastic increase of the portion of macroflocs fig 5f and g in addition a strong halocline occurred during the flood peak flow at 16 h followed by a dual peaked psd in the surface layer these findings indicate that flocculation was enhanced by increased spm concentration and the existence of a halocline it is interesting to note that the mean diameters of the entire water column at the two sites b1 and b2 were almost the same 40 μm fig 4a and b over the monitored tidal cycles despite of different psds with more macroflocs 22 at site b2 than site b1 4 the significant differences in the psds between the two sites highlight the complexity of the spatial variation of flocculation in response to various environmental factors 3 2 3 psd evolution in a tidal cycle the psds in the bottom layer were selected for analysis because the hydrological conditions of this layer were more consistent with that of the benthic tripod comparison of the psds in the bottom layer at sites b1 and b2 fig 5 a and f in relation to turbulent shear g revealed that flocs broke up quickly in high shear conditions g 5 s and concentrated at sizes below 60 μm fig 5d and i conversely the psds were skewed toward larger sizes and particles aggregated more to form macroflocs at low shear conditions g 5 s the psds in the bottom layer were decomposed into lognormal distributions of primary particles flocculi microflocs and macroflocs fig 5b and g to investigate the multimodality of flocs primary particles flocculi microflocs and macroflocs accounted for 5 23 7 63 2 and 8 1 respectively at site b1 and 8 5 35 6 54 0 and 1 9 respectively at site b2 when averaged over two monitored tidal cycles microflocs dominated at both sites in the pearl river estuary and the variation of psds was caused mainly by constant flocculi microfloc exchange the fraction of each size class was steady during low turbulent shear conditions g 5 s but readjustment of the psds with frequent exchange between neighboring classes occurred during high turbulent shear g 5 s these results suggest the existence of a critical shear rate g below which the rates of breakup and aggregation are comparable resulting in a slow exchange between neighboring classes and above which the breakup rate is accelerated rapidly leading to a left skewed psd with sizes mostly below 60 μm the value of g depends on the constitution of the flocs and environment factors e g organic matter ph for sites b1 and b2 which were both in shallow water a value of g 5 s was identified from the field data 3 2 4 numerical modelling particle size is determined by its value in the previous moment and the current change rate influenced by interior and environmental factors i e d t d t 1 d d d t our field observation shows nonlinear relationships between the particle size and the influencing factors numerical models were used to further unravel the relationships by using k18 to estimate the impacts of mass concentration c and turbulent shear rate g on flocculation based on the time series of field data we found that values of k a 0 45 0 55 and k b 3 0e 5 5 0e 5 worked reasonably well most of the time for site b1 before 22 h and b2 after 6 h fig 5c and h these values are close to those derived in previous research e g k a 0 15 and k b o 10 5 by winterwerp 1998 and k a 0 5 and k b 5 0e 6 by kuprenas et al 2018 the model was able to predict the size of flocs track its transition point and capture the range of floc size variation fig 5c and h with r 0 74 0 72 and rmse 17 12 μm for site b1 before 22 h b2 despite of some bias this model shows a reasonable performance when g and c changes considering the variation of g fig 5d and i and c fig 5e and j were inconsistency in this case the mismatch at site b1 when front occurred after 22 h is partly attributed to changing water properties that could have affected k a via e c and k b the mismatch at site b2 around 6 h is partly attributed to small particles from resuspension or advection besides the other three factors could also cause some bias 1 simplified model parameters 2 relatively low resolution of the data because of the limited sampling rate 3 sediment trapping by the halocline which was not considered in the model the overall good agreement between simulation results and field data provides us a strong argument that the model has reliably reproduced a suite of scenarios of flocculation and that the results can thus be interpreted in further detail to derive insights into the impacts of g and c on flocculation 4 discussion 4 1 floc size evolution the effects of initial particle size d 0 shear rate g and concentration c on floc size evolution were investigated respectively by using the control variable method i e only one factor was changed at a time based on the combination of data from site b1 and numerical study five initial floc sizes namely 0 25 d 0 0 5 d 0 d 0 1 5 d 0 and 2 5 d 0 where d 0 45 μm were defined in the first set of model test results show that the floc size evolution converged to d 0 at around 3 8 h for initial sizes larger than d 0 fig 6 a evolution of the 0 5 d 0 particle size 23 μm converged to the larger size groups later at 10 h which is close to one tidal cycle however the smallest particles 0 25 d 0 11 μm appear to grow continuously and approach the curves of other size groups not earlier than at 22 h two tidal cycles these results reveal that particles with different size would be gradually assimilated that is only particles of a certain size could be maintained under certain circumstances but the assimilation rate depends on the initial particle size i e higher rate with larger particles and vice visa the same scaling factors were applied to the shear rate in a second set of model test results show that the larger the shear the smaller the particle size is fig 6b it is interesting to note that the trends of floc size evolution after 2 7 h are consistent in all shear rates except in the lowest case 0 25g their sizes range of variation increase in sequence of 24 26 29 and 37 μm multiplied with 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 5 respectively the particle size in lowest g deviate from others by showing a quasi equilibrium at around 94 μm after 14 h a slightly decreased shear rate 0 5g results in an increase of particle size by 16 7 compared to the reference result of g with mean values from 72 μm to 84 μm in contrast a further enhancement of the shear rate to 2 5g led to a decrease of particle size by 25 3 to 53 8 μm compared to the reference result these outcomes explain the results in section 3 2 1 that the average diameter of flocs in hs 37 μm was significantly smaller than that in ls similar result was derived by guo et al 2017 who found that particle diameter in a spring tide with stronger shear is much smaller than that in a neap tide in a third set of model test the impact of spm concentration was investigated we found that higher concentrations lead to larger particle sizes and a greater range of variation fig 6c in high shear conditions e g g 8 s at 10 h particle size becomes almost uniform for diverse concentration which indicates a dominant control of high shear on floc size in the case of high concentration 2 5c the maximum floc size is 515 μm when g is low i e g 1 s at 14 h exceeding the upper limit of the lisst measurement range which explains the warping tail phenomenon observed in regions of high turbidity if concentration is low e g in cases of 0 25c and 0 5c flocs would grow slowly and their size would vary in a small range from the initial size this explains a limited floc development in open seas with clear water as well as provides the justification for a larger span of floc size in a spring tide with higher concentration than that in a neap tide reported by guo et al 2017 it is interesting to note that the asymmetrical fluctuations of floc size become more apparent with a decrease of both shear fig 6b and concentration fig 6c i e longer time is needed to reach the maximum floc size in a tidal cycle in case of low shear and concentration this might help predict the time with maximum floc size when upstream runoff and sediment change or when shear changes in a neap spring tidal cycle 4 2 aggregation and breakup rate in different cases the exact values of a and b in eq 5 determine the flocculation process for site b1 fig 6g the maximum absolute values of aggregation and breakup rates were both 6 0 10 2 μm s and the net rate dd d t ranged from 1 77 10 2 to 1 07 10 2 μm s with a mean absolute value of 2 8 10 3 μm s in the two tidal cycles in case of small initial floc size 0 25d0 fig 6d the terms a and b were around 1 53 10 5 and 2 3 10 6 μm s respectively with the net rate around only 1 3 10 5 μm s at first and it persisted for 2 46 h for the high d 0 case 2 5d0 fig 6j the rate of floc breakup was greater than the rate of aggregation the net rate even reached 1 9 10 2 μm s at first because b is more sensitive to particle size than a comparison of the two case reveals that smaller flocs are likely to remain unchanged for several hours because of the low aggregation and breakup rates in contrast larger flocs breaks up freely it also explains that larger particles can be more easily assimilated fig 6a for high shear conditions 1 5g and 2 5g the terms a and b were within 1 58 61 10 2 and 1 07 12 10 3 μm s respectively fig 6h and k however the resultant net rates were confined within a small range of 2 74 2 2 10 3 μm s shear enhances both aggregation and breakup processes thereby limiting the net rates and floc size in a certain range it explains that the trends of floc size evolution are consistent in diverse shear rates fig 6b in low shear condition 0 25g the mean values of a and b were 2 46 10 3 and 1 51 10 3 μm s respectively being only 1 4 and 1 6 of the values in original shear g condition fig 6g these results suggest that a decrease of shear would lead to decrease in both aggregation and breakup rates a continuous growth of floc size might be attributed to a larger deduction of term b by 5 6 than that of term a by 3 4 fig 6b furthermore the maximum absolute values of aggregation and breakup rates were both in o 10 3 with a mean value of the net rate of 2 67 10 4 μm s for low concentration condition 0 25c fig 6f however these rates were notably different for high concentrations 2 5c fig 6l the maximum and mean values of aggregation and breakup rates were almost two orders of magnitudes higher than the low concentration case and characterized by significant fluctuations causing occasionally drastic change of floc size fig 6c the absolute value of net rate in high concentration 2 5c condition was 1 53 10 2 μm s approximately 55 times larger than the low concentration 0 25c condition fig 6f this also explains the larger variation of floc size in higher concentration condition fig 6c 4 3 impact of shear and concentration on equilibrium diameter and flocculation time in the simplified w98 model a b leads to the equilibrium diameter d e d p k a c k b g where k a 1 2 k a ρ s d p and k b k b 2 μ f y 1 2 this relationship indicates that the impact of concentration c on d e is larger than that of shear g and that d e increases as c increases however this disagrees with existing observations e g cuthbertson et al 2010 guo et al 2018 tran et al 2018 in k18 assuming that d p d and n f 2 a b leads to 8 k a c k b g d e 2 1 2 k c g d e 2 1 2 where k a k a ρ s k b k b μ f y a n d k c 5 2 v 1 2 it is difficult to separate out d e in this formulation because of the modified q eq 7 in eq 5 however numerical simulation results fig 7 a based on data from site b1 indicate that d e is dependent on shear and concentration results also suggest the existence of a critical concentration c below which the impact of concentration on d e is stronger than shear while above which d e is inversely proportional to the kolmogorov microscale and weakly correlated to concentration similar patterns were also obtained for different values of k a and k b suggesting the wide existence of the empirical formulation d e k c c 1 g c 2 the value of c depends on the constitution of flocs and environmental factors e g organic matter ph for site b1 a value of c 50 mg l was found to work reasonably well fig 7a by using curve fitting tools the best values of c1 c2 and k in the empirical formulation d e k c c 1 g c 2 were obtained f o r c c c 1 0 72 c 2 0 32 k 10 3 for c c c 1 0 13 c 2 0 5 k 10 3 27 for c c the impact of concentration on flocculation is more than twice as strong as shear however floc size is limited gradually by shear as concentration increases consistent with d e η and the effect of shear on d e becomes more than three times as strong as concentration when c c this finding agrees with the experimental measurements of tran et al 2018 showing that d e has weak dependence on concentration when c 50 mg l the concise expression cgt f 1 2 10 4 for d 0 d p is consistent with the model results based on site b1 data when the concentration is not too low i e c 10 mg l and d e 10 μm fig 7b similar patterns were also obtained for different values of k a and k b which indicates that t f 1 c g may apply widely this relationship provides a simple way to estimate whether the quasi equilibrium state could be achieved in both lab experiment and field and thus sheds light on evaluation of the floc status as winterwerp 1998 showed t f 2 t when d e d 0 and t f t d e d 0 when d e d 0 where t is a timescale parameter defined as t 1 k b g 3 2 d e 2 the t f in the former case is far less than the latter because d e d 0 2 this accounts for the asymmetry of the aggregation and breakup rates of the particles fig 6b and c i e particle size decreases more rapidly than it increases especially for larger particles for d e d 0 d e d p k a c k b g k a c k b g in case of sufficiently small d p we obtain cgt f 1 k a d 0 3 55 10 4 which is larger than the results of the k18 model i e cgt f 1 2 10 4 the reason for this difference is that the particle size in k18 is limited to the kolmogorov microscale η see eq 7 thus the time required to reach equilibrium status decreases furthermore in the pearl river estuary d e and t f vary considerably from 10 to 290 μm and from 6 to 200 h respectively accounting for non equilibrium status commonly found in the field 4 4 impact of salinity on vertical distribution of floc size there were large differences between site b1 and b2 in the hydrological background see section 3 1 especially in the salinity structure fig 2b and e comparison of the median diameter between the two sites in the entire water column and upper and lower layers relative to halocline fig 8 revealed that salinity could increase the vertical variation of floc size in site b1 which is dominated by fresh water strong correlation of floc size was found among the three layers i e 0 96 and 0 85 between the entire water column and the upper and lower layers respectively in site b2 characterized by stratified water with a halocline fig 2e the mean diameter of flocs in the entire water column showed significant positive correlation with the upper layer r 0 78 but negative correlation with the lower layer r 0 25 another remarkable difference is the particle size between the surface and bottom layers the mean floc diameter in the upper layer 43 μm was smaller than in the lower layer 56 μm at site b1 while the situation at site b2 was opposite with much larger particles in the upper layer 90 μm than that in the lower layer 39 μm this distinct pattern indicates that the halocline forms a barrier between freshwater in the surface and saltwater in the bottom and thus hinders vertical exchange of flocs at site b2 the vertical average standard deviations of floc size were 45 and 42 μm in the entire water column and the upper layer respectively being much larger than that in the lower layer 13 μm in contrast floc size varied a little with standard deviations of 18 15 and 11 μm in the three layers at site b1 this reveals that the flocs in the upper layer were trapped by the halocline at site b2 the distinct patterns of flocculation above and below the halocline with very limited exchange implies that flocculation modeling in stratified estuarine waters can be simplified into two layers with the boundary at the halocline 4 5 perspectives of future work this study proved the general validity of the modified winterwerp model kuprenas et al 2018 and its use in understanding flocculation performance in an estuary the pearl river estuary however performance of this model is also likely to be affected by changes in water properties and resuspension of large numbers of small particles from the bed besides the factors discussed above i e g c and s a wide range of physical and biogeochemical factors e g organic matter content ph value and ionic strength are also found to have considerable impacts on flocculation e g maggi 2009 nguyen et al 2018 shen et al 2018b c lai et al 2018 however the nonlinear relationships among these variables increase the complexity of depicting in situ flocculation in addition to further development of mechanistic models for better presenting flocculation dynamics under the control of various physical and biogeochemical factors big data driven approaches may provide a promising alternative artificial intelligence ai approaches have proven to be capable of recognizing complex and nonlinear relationships among large number of variables and therefore might provide a new way of flocculation modeling so far ai has been successfully used to predict water quality shamshirband et al 2019 and assessment of suspended sediment load in estuaries and coastal waters olyaie et al 2015 5 conclusions this study investigated flocculation in a tide dominated estuary based on in situ observations and numerical modelling with the aim to derive further insights into flocculation processes controlled by varying shear concentration and salinity conditions based on the results the following conclusions are drawn 1 in the pearl river estuary microflocs generally dominate and the variation of the psds is caused mainly by constant exchange between flocculi and microflocs a critical shear rate g 5 s below which floc exchange occurs slowly and above which the psds become left skewed and clustered below 60 μm is identified for the study sites on the other hand the trends of floc size evolution are similar among diverse tidal shear cycles because of the limitation of shear on particle size 2 the net flocculation rate is higher when the initial floc size is larger however this applies only to the initial phase and the rates become gradually synchronous among cases of different initial floc size 3 flocculation is facilitated by increase of spm concentration the increasing rate of the net flocculation rate however is one order of magnitude larger than that of spm concentration 4 a critical concentration c 50 mg l below which the impact of concentration on the equilibrium diameter of flocs d e is more than twice as strong as shear while above which d e is inversely proportional to the kolmogorov microscale η and weakly correlated to concentration was identified for area dominated by fresh water flow in other words the impact of concentration shear on d e decreases increases as concentration increases and d e is inversely proportional to η in case of high concentration 50 mg l 5 the time required to achieve d e from primary particle d p namely t f is dependent on the spm concentration c and the turbulent shear g through a relationship t f 1 c g in shallow waters dominated by barotropic flow i e vertically homogeneous and medium spm concentration level c 10 mg l such as site b1 in our study area t f 1 2 10 4 c g is found 6 in stratified waters characterized by a halocline flocculation can be divided into two vertical layers separated by the halocline flocculation can be regarded homogeneous within each layer but differs significantly between the two layers this allows simplification of numerical modelling of flocculation into two layers in 3d models for typical stratified estuarine and coastal waters 7 single class flocculation model such as the winterwerp model is useful in understanding first order flocculation processes in estuaries especially in barotropic flows however models including multiple size classes to better present psds in the two layers divided by the halocline are needed to further understand flocculation dynamics in natural estuarine and coastal waters credit authorship contribution statement ying zhang conceptualization

5511,tide dominated estuaries are often characterized by a high variability of turbulent shear suspended particulate matter spm concentration and salinity which poses challenges for a comprehensive understanding of its mass transport including cohesive sediment dynamics here a combined in situ and numerical study was undertaken to investigate the mechanism of flocculation during tidal cycles with the aim to disentangle the impacts of turbulent shear spm concentration and salinity on flocs results show that microflocs 20 200 μm dominate in the pearl river estuary and floc size variation is caused primarily by exchange between flocculi 4 20 μm and microflocs we also identified a critical shear rate g 5 s below which floc exchange occurs slowly above the threshold the particle size distribution is left skewed and clustered below 60 μm evolutions of flocs with different initial sizes synchronize gradually to adapt to the local hydrological environment the trends of floc size evolution and absolute net flocculation rates are similar among diverse tidal shear cycles the reason can be attributed to the turbulent shear which enhances both aggregation and breakup processes thereby limiting the floc size in a certain range the higher the concentration the larger both the particle size and the range of variation in addition results of numerical modelling reveal that the flocculation time for primary particles is inversely proportional to shear and concentration a critical concentration c 50 mg l below which the impact of concentration on the equilibrium diameter of flocs is more than twice as strong as shear whilst above which the equilibrium diameter is inversely proportional to the kolmogorov microscale and weakly correlated to concentration was also identified furthermore halocline was found to increase vertical variation of flocs size suggesting co existence of different flocculation mechanisms across this layer abbreviations adcp acoustic

water mass transport e g in tide dominated estuaries characterized by simultaneously high variability of turbulent shear g spm concentration c and salinity s in each tidal cycle impedes a comprehensive understanding of flocculation mechanisms in natural waters thomas et al 1999 the impacts of two dominant factors i e c and g on flocculation characteristics such as floc size d rates of aggregation and breakup equilibrium diameter d e representing the floc size when aggregation and break up are balanced and flocculation time t f representing the time required to attain d e from an initial floc size d 0 under steady concentration and shear conditions have yet to be quantified explicitly in situ winterwerp 1998 guo et al 2017 it has been found that the evolution trend of d is determined by d e flocs tend to grow when d d e and break when d d e in addition t f defines the maximal timescale of flocculation process winterwerp 1998 the impact of g on d has been explored extensively in most previous studies a critical shear rate representing an optimal condition for flocculation below which the floc size increases with g and above which the floc size declines with an increasing g has been identified dyer 1989 mietta et al 2009 kumar et al 2010 value of this critical shear rate has been found to range around 15 40 s manning and dyer 1999 kumar et al 2010 sahin 2014 zhang et al 2019b large flocs 200 μm are supposed to form in slack water with reduced g guo et al 2017 accordingly the particle size distributions psds of flocs are skewed toward larger sizes under low turbulent shear and vice versa lee et al 2012 moreover d e is inversely proportional to the kolmogorov microscale η bowers et al 2007 cross et al 2013 however quantitative assessment of the impact of g on d in natural estuaries is still lacking because of the impact of various interacting environmental factors and forces which often lead to non equilibrium status of d in response to changing g winterwerp 1998 previous research indicates that the influence of c on d is not as straightforward as that proposed by classic aggregation theory especially on the assumption that higher concentration increases floc size because of enhanced inter particle collisions hill 1998 for example c is found to enhance flocculation when turbulence decreases guo et al 2018 but has limited effect in promoting macrofloc i e d 200 μm formation li et al 2017 d responds quickly to a decrease in c i e from 400 mg l to 50 mg l but d e has a weak positive correlation with c when g is at a medium level e g g 50 s tran et al 2018 these results suggest that the relationship between c and d is corrugated by g a further limitation in current understanding of flocculation is the relationship between t f c and g t f is usually used to estimate whether an equilibrium status could be achieved in a settling column maggi et al 2002 the measured maximum floc size could be locally maintained only if t f exceeds the floc residence time cuthbertson et al 2010 an increase in g is supposed to shorten t f through increasing both aggregation and breakup rates mietta et al 2009 he et al 2018 an analytical solution of t f can be obtained based on the winterwerp flocculation model winterwerp 1998 2002 by relating t f to d e c and g however the model has been further developed to be more applicable kuprenas et al 2018 specifically a more precise formulation of t f is desirable besides a dominant control by c and g the impact of salinity including salinity induced stratification such as front or halocline on flocculation could not be neglected in estuarine environments ren and wu 2014 an increase in salinity is supposed to enhance flocculation as salt would decrease the particles surface charge mietta et al 2009 however based on in situ observations contradictory results have been derived with regard to the impact of an increasing salinity on floc size burt 1986 eisma et al 1991 van leussen 1999 a consensus about the role of salinity is that there exists an optimum salinity for flocculation however its value is dependent on the specific environmental and spm lithologic configuration shen and maa 2016 guo et al 2017 it is difficult to measure the exact rates of simultaneous aggregation and breakup and to investigate flocculation mechanism in situ due to constantly changing c and or g and or s instead these rates could be estimated by numerical models that fit observed distribution of flocs and then the model could help predict transport and fate of fine grained suspended cohesive sediments shen and maa 2015 2016 thus development of robust numerical models which could resolve the complex interactions between flocculation and its controlling factors is of critical importance in general three types of flocculation model exist the first is based on the extended lattice boltzmann model which is able to predict a full spectrum of flocs properties such as psds and settling velocities but on the other hand is highly expensive in terms of computational cost zhang et al 2013 the second type is the population balance modeling which represents psds with two or multiple size groups classes maggi et al 2007 lee et al 2011 2014 shen and maa 2015 2016 shen et al 2018a the third type refers to the winterwerp flocculation model which traces the evolution of a characteristic floc size and describes the relevant aggregation and breakup processes the winterwerp flocculation model is widely used because of its high computational efficiency and easy integration into hydrodynamics models winterwerp 1998 2002 winterwerp and kesteren 2004 kuprenas et al 2018 based on in situ measurements in the pearl river estuary and numerical modelling results this study aims to further advance the understanding of flocculation processes by 1 modelling the flocculation process in response to changing c and g in tidal cycle 2 assessing the quantitative impact of c and g on the equilibrium diameter d e and flocculation time t f exploring 3 the response of floc size d aggregation and breakup rates to initial particle diameter d 0 c and g and 4 the impact of salinity induced

hydrodynamics of this area is mainly controlled by semidiurnal tides with obvious salinity velocity and turbidity cycles the mean annual loads of freshwater and riverine sediment are approximately 2 86 1011 m3 and 3 04 107 t respectively zhang et al 2019a two sites with contrasting salinity conditions namely b1 which is affected mainly by freshwater flow and b2 which is featured by periodic salt water intrusion following a tidal cycle were selected to investigate flocculation processes fig 1 field work recording psds turbulence velocity turbidity and salinity was conducted continuously covering two full semi diurnal tides between august 24 25 2018 and august 25 26 2018 at the two sites respectively in situ psds of volume equivalent spherical particles in 36 logarithmically spaced size groups over the range 1 500 μm were measured using the lisst 200x laser in situ scattering and transmissiometry instrument agrawal and pottsmith 2000 which is valid for spm concentrations from 20 mg l to 1000 mg l fettweis et al 2006 guo et al 2017 the salinity temperature and turbidity were measured using an obs 3a optical backscatterance sensor the device was connected online so that the depths of interest e g surface middle and bottom layers or thin layer boundary layer halocline thermocline can be located by real time transmitted data the lisst 200x and obs 3a were installed in a steel frame that was deployed at an hourly interval in each deployment it was firstly lowered from the water surface to the bottom in a steady speed of 0 1 m s then the device stayed in the bottom middle where the halocline was located and surface layers by turn where they remained for approximately 5 min each with sampling frequency of 1 hz meanwhile water samples were collected and filtered by preweighed filters for calibration of turbidity and spm concentration values bottom sediment samples were also collected for analysis of the size of primary particles using a malvern mastersizer 3000 which covers a size range of 0 01 3500 μm in addition an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv and 5 beam acoustic doppler current profiler adcp were mounted on a benthic tripod and deployed at each site turbulence data were collected by the adv 64 hz located at 0 55 m above the bed the vertical current structure was measured by the upward looking adcp which operated at 8 hz in twelve bins 50 cm interval with 5 min bursts in every 10 min 2 2 data processing 2 2 1 lisst data four steps were performed to obtain the psd of each layer these include 1 data inversion 2 quality control 3 spike removal and 4 ensemble averaging in the first step small angle scattering data were inverted into psd data using a matlab inversion script http www sequoiasci com in the step of quality control optical transmission within a range of 0 15 0 98 was considered to indicate good quality data agrawal and pottsmith 2000 the third step spike removal was essential to eliminate both the effects of short term variations and the influence of advection vertical sediment transport and outliers of the psds mikkelsen and pejrup 2001 we applied the method of local outlier factor detection by breunig et al 2000 which is implemented in python to remove spikes of particle size from the time series of the median particle diameter d 50 after this step covariance of the ensemble d 50 was reduced significantly e g to 1 2 of the pre processing value in surface layer at site b1 in the final step the psds of each layer were averaged for each hourly ensemble to produce representative psds 2 2 2 decomposition of multimodal psds generally the psds of flocs in a coastal zone can be decomposed into four lognormal size classes to represent primary particles 0 4 μm flocculi 4 20 μm microflocs 20 200 μm and macroflocs 200 500 μm lee et al 2012 hussein et al 2005 mäkelä et al 2000 whitey 2007 given by 1 dv dd i 1 4 v i 2 π l n σ i exp 1 2 ln d d i l n σ i 2 where v and d are the volumetric concentration and diameter of each size interval of the lisst 200x measured psds respectively dv dd is the volumetric fraction normalized by the width of the size interval that is used for curve fitting to a lognormal distribution hinds 1999 and d i σ i and v i eq 1 are the representative size standard deviation and volumetric concentration respectively of the i th lognormal psd i 1 2 3 4 the mean diameters of the four size classes were derived as curve fitting parameters based on observation here σ was limited to 2 5 to prevent unrealistically wide psds fettweis et al 2012 a mean value of σ 1 63 was obtained in our observation the curve fitting tool implemented in python http www scipy org was used to determine the best fit to a measured psd i e the minimum error between the simulated and measured psds lee et al 2012 the quality of the curve fitting analysis was monitored with absolute percentage error defined as the ratio between the sum of errors and experimental data 2 2 3 turbulence data turbulent shear rate g is defined as g v η 2 ε v s where v is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid η is the kolmogorov microscale and ε is the mean turbulent energy dissipation rate g was estimated from the high frequency velocity data recorded by the adv the adv derived raw data requires preprocessing before turbulent parameters can be estimated a robust nonparametric technique that can identify outliers thompson 1985 lanzante 1996 was used to remove spikes from the fluctuating velocity time series afterwards the turbulence kinetic energy tke spectra method guerra and thomson 2017 was applied to estimate ε 2 s w f α ε 2 3 f 5 3 u 2 π 2 3 where s w is the tke spectra f is the frequency α is a constant 0 69 sreenivasan 1995 and u is the mean along channel velocity the tke spectra method is based on the kolmogorov hypothesis i e there exist a range of turbulent length scales within the isotropic turbulence energy cascade known as the inertial subrange in which energy transfer is determined solely by the dissipation rate kolmogorov 1941 pope 2000 however the inertial subrange is variable due to changes in the hydrological factors this poses a challenge on solving the dissipation rate to derive a precise inertial subrange a three step procedure was applied in this study firstly each estimated spectrum was multiplied by f 5 3 to obtain a compensated spectrum which should be horizontal flat in the presence of an inertial subrange the dissipation rate was estimated by solving eq 3 3 s w f f 5 3 f 2 f 1 α ε 2 3 u 2 π 2 3 where f1 and f2 indicate the lower and upper frequency limit of the compensated spectrum respectively guerra and thomson 2017 the range of frequencies varies for different mean flows between 2 f 10 hz in our observation secondly the frequency range e g 2 10 hz was divided into intervals e g 0 2 hz so that the subrange collection was obtained by permutation and combination the frequency band of each subrange was required to be no less than 2 hz to provide sufficient integral spectrum data the final step is to search the optimal subrange criteria for defining the best subrange include a the error between the compensated spectrum and its robust regression is sufficiently small e g 30 percentile b the slope of the robust regression is sufficiently close to zero e g 10 percentile c afterwards sufficient integral spectrum data remain for the calculation e g 50 percentile and d then the slope of the robust regression is the closest to zero 2 3 numerical modelling of flocculation the winterwerp 1998 model referred to w98 hereafter is a simple lagrangian type floc growth equation used to predict the temporal evolution of a single characteristic floc size it reflects how factors such as shear concentration floc structure and the inherited floc size act on the aggregation and breakup rates specifically it is a rate equation for an average floc size d expressed as 4 dd dt a b where a and b are the aggregation and breakup kernels respectively expressed in dimensions of l t a and b are calculated by a k a n f d p n f 3 ρ s g c d 4 n f 5 b k b n f d g d d p d p p τ t τ y q where d p is the size of the primary particles n f is the floc fractal dimension ρ s is the density of the unflocculated sediment and p and q are nondimensional power coefficients in the floc erosion kernel k a is a dimensionless aggregation coefficient defined as k a 3 e c π e d 2 f s where f s is a floc shape factor and e c and e d are efficiency parameters for coagulation and diffusion respectively e c is an empirical parameter related to the physicochemical properties of the sediment and the water as well as the organic compounds within the sediment van leussen 1994 k b is an empirical coefficient of floc breakup efficiency τ t is the turbulence induced stress on the floc and τ y is the strength of the floc they are calculated by τ t μ g 6 τ y f y d 2 where μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid and f y is the floc yield strength in the dimension of force winterwerp 1998 proposed that p 3 n f based on the assumptions that d p d e and d e 1 g bowers et al 2007 cross et al 2013 q 0 5 is adopted to satisfy that settling velocity ω d uncertainty in the coefficients k a and k b related to the spm concentration limits the use of the w98 model for predictive modeling as an alternative kuprenas et al 2018 modified the coefficient q of the w98 floc breakup rate kernel referred to k18 hereafter as follows 7 q c 1 c 2 d η where c 1 and c 2 are constant coefficients this simple modification limits the size of the floc to the kolmogorov microscale η thereby improving the time dependent solution behavior without requiring recalibration coefficients for every change of concentration the key state variables in k18 model include the particle size the mass spm concentration and the turbulent shear in this study time series of these variables derived from field observation were fed into the model to evaluate the flocculation process the parameters setting used to explore the psds evolution in tidal cycles was as follows n f 2 f y 1e 10 n ρ s 2650 kg m3 p 3 n f c 1 0 5 c 2 1 5 and d p 5 μm according to the malvern measurements zhang et al 2019b the initial particle size d 0 was set to the size of the measured floc at the beginning t 1 μ was calculated based on in situ temperature and salinity data g was derived from the adv and c was determined from obs after calibration more details about the choice of these parameters and its sensitivity analysis could be found in kuprenas et al 2018 3 results 3 1 hydrodynamic conditions the field survey sites b1 and b2 fig 1 were in shallow water with average depth of approximately 3 3 and 5 0 m and mean spm concentration of approximately 30 and 40 mg l respectively fig 2 the semi diurnal tides were asymmetric and ebb dominant the maximum vertically averaged ebb flow velocity at b1 and b2 was 0 51 and 1 13 m s respectively fig 2a and d at site b1 the variations of channel velocity salinity and mass concentration were almost consistent throughout the entire water column fig 2a c fresh water dominated here with salinity mostly 2 practical salinity units psu however the arrival of a density front at high water of the flood tide at 22 h caused an abrupt change characterized by a drastic rise of salinity up to 5 psu fig 2b and a large vertical gradient of spm concentration near the seabed fig 2c site b2 was further offshore and the water mass there was notably different from site b1 site b2 was dominated by saline water 20 4 psu characterized by a halocline near the surface fig 2e the vertical structure of velocity varied widely e g strong currents were confined mainly at the surface but sometimes penetrated into the middle layer fig 2d it is worth to note that an exceptionally high spm concentration event 200 mg l occurred at 6 h during the monitoring period near the seabed at this site fig 2f 3 2 psd variation 3 2 1 vertical structure of psds at high low shear rate profiles of high shear fig 3 a at 4 h referred to hs hereafter and low shear fig 3b at 8 h referred to ls hereafter at site b1 with the same salinity structure and similar concentration range were selected for analysis the vertical average diameter of hs 37 μm was significantly smaller than ls 60 μm the psd of hs was centered around 22 μm with significant positive skewness whereas that of ls was centered around 66 μm with slightly negative skewness microflocs with a mean diameter of 31 μm dominated in hs accounting for 74 2 of the total volume of particles while macroflocs with a mean diameter of 370 μm accounted for only 0 9 fig 3a in ls the fractions of microflocs and macroflocs were 56 4 and 11 8 with mean diameters of 88 6 and 376 μm respectively fig 3b these findings confirm that particle size is generally smaller in stronger shear environment in addition floc size increased slightly from the surface towards the bottom layer the mean diameter of the microflocs in the surface middle and bottom layers was 29 6 28 0 and 35 6 μm respectively in hs and 71 6 82 5 and 111 9 μm respectively in ls furthermore the transformations of the psds in the vertical axis were not as gradual and smooth as turbidity or salinity fig 3 on the contrary they were characterized by abrupt and jagged changes fig 3b due to the reason that the transformation of floc size is caused by particle collisions rather than by diffusive movements strong correlation was found between mass concentration and volume concentration with r 0 74 in hs and 0 68 in ls this indicated that the density of flocs was vertically uniform at site b1 3 2 2 psds in different layers at characteristic times at site b1 in peak flood at 11 h and ebb at 4 h flows the vertical mean diameters were 37 6 and 25 4 μm respectively fig 4 c and g the psds of the three layers surface middle and bottom were similar in both flood and ebb peak flows e g with primary particles flocculi microflocs and macroflocs accounting for 6 4 0 5 26 6 67 6 and 0 75 0 25 respectively however the mean diameter in slack waters was notably larger than that in peak flows with values of 70 37 and 40 12 μm in the flood to ebb slack water at 13 h and ebb to flood slack water at 9 h respectively fig 4e and i in addition psd in slack waters was broader especially in the surface layer which exhibited a dual peak concentrated around 5 and 66 μm these results indicate that flocculation prevails over deflocculation in a low shear environment i e g 1 s in slack water and vice versa the psds at site b2 in the middle and bottom layers showed similar patterns with site b1 but differed significantly in the surface layer during the peak flow periods the portion of macroflocs in the surface layer at b2 accounted for 25 and 65 for the flood at 16 h and ebb at 25 h respectively fig 4d and h while during slack water a right skewed psd appeared there sediment resuspension was enhanced during the ebb peak flow at 25 h with near surface concentration up to 36 mg l compared to the values during the slack waters both around 22 mg l the short lasting but intense resuspension at 6h induced not only an increase of spm concentration but also a drastic increase of the portion of macroflocs fig 5f and g in addition a strong halocline occurred during the flood peak flow at 16 h followed by a dual peaked psd in the surface layer these findings indicate that flocculation was enhanced by increased spm concentration and the existence of a halocline it is interesting to note that the mean diameters of the entire water column at the two sites b1 and b2 were almost the same 40 μm fig 4a and b over the monitored tidal cycles despite of different psds with more macroflocs 22 at site b2 than site b1 4 the significant differences in the psds between the two sites highlight the complexity of the spatial variation of flocculation in response to various environmental factors 3 2 3 psd evolution in a tidal cycle the psds in the bottom layer were selected for analysis because the hydrological conditions of this layer were more consistent with that of the benthic tripod comparison of the psds in the bottom layer at sites b1 and b2 fig 5 a and f in relation to turbulent shear g revealed that flocs broke up quickly in high shear conditions g 5 s and concentrated at sizes below 60 μm fig 5d and i conversely the psds were skewed toward larger sizes and particles aggregated more to form macroflocs at low shear conditions g 5 s the psds in the bottom layer were decomposed into lognormal distributions of primary particles flocculi microflocs and macroflocs fig 5b and g to investigate the multimodality of flocs primary particles flocculi microflocs and macroflocs accounted for 5 23 7 63 2 and 8 1 respectively at site b1 and 8 5 35 6 54 0 and 1 9 respectively at site b2 when averaged over two monitored tidal cycles microflocs dominated at both sites in the pearl river estuary and the variation of psds was caused mainly by constant flocculi microfloc exchange the fraction of each size class was steady during low turbulent shear conditions g 5 s but readjustment of the psds with frequent exchange between neighboring classes occurred during high turbulent shear g 5 s these results suggest the existence of a critical shear rate g below which the rates of breakup and aggregation are comparable resulting in a slow exchange between neighboring classes and above which the breakup rate is accelerated rapidly leading to a left skewed psd with sizes mostly below 60 μm the value of g depends on the constitution of the flocs and environment factors e g organic matter ph for sites b1 and b2 which were both in shallow water a value of g 5 s was identified from the field data 3 2 4 numerical modelling particle size is determined by its value in the previous moment and the current change rate influenced by interior and environmental factors i e d t d t 1 d d d t our field observation shows nonlinear relationships between the particle size and the influencing factors numerical models were used to further unravel the relationships by using k18 to estimate the impacts of mass concentration c and turbulent shear rate g on flocculation based on the time series of field data we found that values of k a 0 45 0 55 and k b 3 0e 5 5 0e 5 worked reasonably well most of the time for site b1 before 22 h and b2 after 6 h fig 5c and h these values are close to those derived in previous research e g k a 0 15 and k b o 10 5 by winterwerp 1998 and k a 0 5 and k b 5 0e 6 by kuprenas et al 2018 the model was able to predict the size of flocs track its transition point and capture the range of floc size variation fig 5c and h with r 0 74 0 72 and rmse 17 12 μm for site b1 before 22 h b2 despite of some bias this model shows a reasonable performance when g and c changes considering the variation of g fig 5d and i and c fig 5e and j were inconsistency in this case the mismatch at site b1 when front occurred after 22 h is partly attributed to changing water properties that could have affected k a via e c and k b the mismatch at site b2 around 6 h is partly attributed to small particles from resuspension or advection besides the other three factors could also cause some bias 1 simplified model parameters 2 relatively low resolution of the data because of the limited sampling rate 3 sediment trapping by the halocline which was not considered in the model the overall good agreement between simulation results and field data provides us a strong argument that the model has reliably reproduced a suite of scenarios of flocculation and that the results can thus be interpreted in further detail to derive insights into the impacts of g and c on flocculation 4 discussion 4 1 floc size evolution the effects of initial particle size d 0 shear rate g and concentration c on floc size evolution were investigated respectively by using the control variable method i e only one factor was changed at a time based on the combination of data from site b1 and numerical study five initial floc sizes namely 0 25 d 0 0 5 d 0 d 0 1 5 d 0 and 2 5 d 0 where d 0 45 μm were defined in the first set of model test results show that the floc size evolution converged to d 0 at around 3 8 h for initial sizes larger than d 0 fig 6 a evolution of the 0 5 d 0 particle size 23 μm converged to the larger size groups later at 10 h which is close to one tidal cycle however the smallest particles 0 25 d 0 11 μm appear to grow continuously and approach the curves of other size groups not earlier than at 22 h two tidal cycles these results reveal that particles with different size would be gradually assimilated that is only particles of a certain size could be maintained under certain circumstances but the assimilation rate depends on the initial particle size i e higher rate with larger particles and vice visa the same scaling factors were applied to the shear rate in a second set of model test results show that the larger the shear the smaller the particle size is fig 6b it is interesting to note that the trends of floc size evolution after 2 7 h are consistent in all shear rates except in the lowest case 0 25g their sizes range of variation increase in sequence of 24 26 29 and 37 μm multiplied with 0 5 1 0 1 5 and 2 5 respectively the particle size in lowest g deviate from others by showing a quasi equilibrium at around 94 μm after 14 h a slightly decreased shear rate 0 5g results in an increase of particle size by 16 7 compared to the reference result of g with mean values from 72 μm to 84 μm in contrast a further enhancement of the shear rate to 2 5g led to a decrease of particle size by 25 3 to 53 8 μm compared to the reference result these outcomes explain the results in section 3 2 1 that the average diameter of flocs in hs 37 μm was significantly smaller than that in ls similar result was derived by guo et al 2017 who found that particle diameter in a spring tide with stronger shear is much smaller than that in a neap tide in a third set of model test the impact of spm concentration was investigated we found that higher concentrations lead to larger particle sizes and a greater range of variation fig 6c in high shear conditions e g g 8 s at 10 h particle size becomes almost uniform for diverse concentration which indicates a dominant control of high shear on floc size in the case of high concentration 2 5c the maximum floc size is 515 μm when g is low i e g 1 s at 14 h exceeding the upper limit of the lisst measurement range which explains the warping tail phenomenon observed in regions of high turbidity if concentration is low e g in cases of 0 25c and 0 5c flocs would grow slowly and their size would vary in a small range from the initial size this explains a limited floc development in open seas with clear water as well as provides the justification for a larger span of floc size in a spring tide with higher concentration than that in a neap tide reported by guo et al 2017 it is interesting to note that the asymmetrical fluctuations of floc size become more apparent with a decrease of both shear fig 6b and concentration fig 6c i e longer time is needed to reach the maximum floc size in a tidal cycle in case of low shear and concentration this might help predict the time with maximum floc size when upstream runoff and sediment change or when shear changes in a neap spring tidal cycle 4 2 aggregation and breakup rate in different cases the exact values of a and b in eq 5 determine the flocculation process for site b1 fig 6g the maximum absolute values of aggregation and breakup rates were both 6 0 10 2 μm s and the net rate dd d t ranged from 1 77 10 2 to 1 07 10 2 μm s with a mean absolute value of 2 8 10 3 μm s in the two tidal cycles in case of small initial floc size 0 25d0 fig 6d the terms a and b were around 1 53 10 5 and 2 3 10 6 μm s respectively with the net rate around only 1 3 10 5 μm s at first and it persisted for 2 46 h for the high d 0 case 2 5d0 fig 6j the rate of floc breakup was greater than the rate of aggregation the net rate even reached 1 9 10 2 μm s at first because b is more sensitive to particle size than a comparison of the two case reveals that smaller flocs are likely to remain unchanged for several hours because of the low aggregation and breakup rates in contrast larger flocs breaks up freely it also explains that larger particles can be more easily assimilated fig 6a for high shear conditions 1 5g and 2 5g the terms a and b were within 1 58 61 10 2 and 1 07 12 10 3 μm s respectively fig 6h and k however the resultant net rates were confined within a small range of 2 74 2 2 10 3 μm s shear enhances both aggregation and breakup processes thereby limiting the net rates and floc size in a certain range it explains that the trends of floc size evolution are consistent in diverse shear rates fig 6b in low shear condition 0 25g the mean values of a and b were 2 46 10 3 and 1 51 10 3 μm s respectively being only 1 4 and 1 6 of the values in original shear g condition fig 6g these results suggest that a decrease of shear would lead to decrease in both aggregation and breakup rates a continuous growth of floc size might be attributed to a larger deduction of term b by 5 6 than that of term a by 3 4 fig 6b furthermore the maximum absolute values of aggregation and breakup rates were both in o 10 3 with a mean value of the net rate of 2 67 10 4 μm s for low concentration condition 0 25c fig 6f however these rates were notably different for high concentrations 2 5c fig 6l the maximum and mean values of aggregation and breakup rates were almost two orders of magnitudes higher than the low concentration case and characterized by significant fluctuations causing occasionally drastic change of floc size fig 6c the absolute value of net rate in high concentration 2 5c condition was 1 53 10 2 μm s approximately 55 times larger than the low concentration 0 25c condition fig 6f this also explains the larger variation of floc size in higher concentration condition fig 6c 4 3 impact of shear and concentration on equilibrium diameter and flocculation time in the simplified w98 model a b leads to the equilibrium diameter d e d p k a c k b g where k a 1 2 k a ρ s d p and k b k b 2 μ f y 1 2 this relationship indicates that the impact of concentration c on d e is larger than that of shear g and that d e increases as c increases however this disagrees with existing observations e g cuthbertson et al 2010 guo et al 2018 tran et al 2018 in k18 assuming that d p d and n f 2 a b leads to 8 k a c k b g d e 2 1 2 k c g d e 2 1 2 where k a k a ρ s k b k b μ f y a n d k c 5 2 v 1 2 it is difficult to separate out d e in this formulation because of the modified q eq 7 in eq 5 however numerical simulation results fig 7 a based on data from site b1 indicate that d e is dependent on shear and concentration results also suggest the existence of a critical concentration c below which the impact of concentration on d e is stronger than shear while above which d e is inversely proportional to the kolmogorov microscale and weakly correlated to concentration similar patterns were also obtained for different values of k a and k b suggesting the wide existence of the empirical formulation d e k c c 1 g c 2 the value of c depends on the constitution of flocs and environmental factors e g organic matter ph for site b1 a value of c 50 mg l was found to work reasonably well fig 7a by using curve fitting tools the best values of c1 c2 and k in the empirical formulation d e k c c 1 g c 2 were obtained f o r c c c 1 0 72 c 2 0 32 k 10 3 for c c c 1 0 13 c 2 0 5 k 10 3 27 for c c the impact of concentration on flocculation is more than twice as strong as shear however floc size is limited gradually by shear as concentration increases consistent with d e η and the effect of shear on d e becomes more than three times as strong as concentration when c c this finding agrees with the experimental measurements of tran et al 2018 showing that d e has weak dependence on concentration when c 50 mg l the concise expression cgt f 1 2 10 4 for d 0 d p is consistent with the model results based on site b1 data when the concentration is not too low i e c 10 mg l and d e 10 μm fig 7b similar patterns were also obtained for different values of k a and k b which indicates that t f 1 c g may apply widely this relationship provides a simple way to estimate whether the quasi equilibrium state could be achieved in both lab experiment and field and thus sheds light on evaluation of the floc status as winterwerp 1998 showed t f 2 t when d e d 0 and t f t d e d 0 when d e d 0 where t is a timescale parameter defined as t 1 k b g 3 2 d e 2 the t f in the former case is far less than the latter because d e d 0 2 this accounts for the asymmetry of the aggregation and breakup rates of the particles fig 6b and c i e particle size decreases more rapidly than it increases especially for larger particles for d e d 0 d e d p k a c k b g k a c k b g in case of sufficiently small d p we obtain cgt f 1 k a d 0 3 55 10 4 which is larger than the results of the k18 model i e cgt f 1 2 10 4 the reason for this difference is that the particle size in k18 is limited to the kolmogorov microscale η see eq 7 thus the time required to reach equilibrium status decreases furthermore in the pearl river estuary d e and t f vary considerably from 10 to 290 μm and from 6 to 200 h respectively accounting for non equilibrium status commonly found in the field 4 4 impact of salinity on vertical distribution of floc size there were large differences between site b1 and b2 in the hydrological background see section 3 1 especially in the salinity structure fig 2b and e comparison of the median diameter between the two sites in the entire water column and upper and lower layers relative to halocline fig 8 revealed that salinity could increase the vertical variation of floc size in site b1 which is dominated by fresh water strong correlation of floc size was found among the three layers i e 0 96 and 0 85 between the entire water column and the upper and lower layers respectively in site b2 characterized by stratified water with a halocline fig 2e the mean diameter of flocs in the entire water column showed significant positive correlation with the upper layer r 0 78 but negative correlation with the lower layer r 0 25 another remarkable difference is the particle size between the surface and bottom layers the mean floc diameter in the upper layer 43 μm was smaller than in the lower layer 56 μm at site b1 while the situation at site b2 was opposite with much larger particles in the upper layer 90 μm than that in the lower layer 39 μm this distinct pattern indicates that the halocline forms a barrier between freshwater in the surface and saltwater in the bottom and thus hinders vertical exchange of flocs at site b2 the vertical average standard deviations of floc size were 45 and 42 μm in the entire water column and the upper layer respectively being much larger than that in the lower layer 13 μm in contrast floc size varied a little with standard deviations of 18 15 and 11 μm in the three layers at site b1 this reveals that the flocs in the upper layer were trapped by the halocline at site b2 the distinct patterns of flocculation above and below the halocline with very limited exchange implies that flocculation modeling in stratified estuarine waters can be simplified into two layers with the boundary at the halocline 4 5 perspectives of future work this study proved the general validity of the modified winterwerp model kuprenas et al 2018 and its use in understanding flocculation performance in an estuary the pearl river estuary however performance of this model is also likely to be affected by changes in water properties and resuspension of large numbers of small particles from the bed besides the factors discussed above i e g c and s a wide range of physical and biogeochemical factors e g organic matter content ph value and ionic strength are also found to have considerable impacts on flocculation e g maggi 2009 nguyen et al 2018 shen et al 2018b c lai et al 2018 however the nonlinear relationships among these variables increase the complexity of depicting in situ flocculation in addition to further development of mechanistic models for better presenting flocculation dynamics under the control of various physical and biogeochemical factors big data driven approaches may provide a promising alternative artificial intelligence ai approaches have proven to be capable of recognizing complex and nonlinear relationships among large number of variables and therefore might provide a new way of flocculation modeling so far ai has been successfully used to predict water quality shamshirband et al 2019 and assessment of suspended sediment load in estuaries and coastal waters olyaie et al 2015 5 conclusions this study investigated flocculation in a tide dominated estuary based on in situ observations and numerical modelling with the aim to derive further insights into flocculation processes controlled by varying shear concentration and salinity conditions based on the results the following conclusions are drawn 1 in the pearl river estuary microflocs generally dominate and the variation of the psds is caused mainly by constant exchange between flocculi and microflocs a critical shear rate g 5 s below which floc exchange occurs slowly and above which the psds become left skewed and clustered below 60 μm is identified for the study sites on the other hand the trends of floc size evolution are similar among diverse tidal shear cycles because of the limitation of shear on particle size 2 the net flocculation rate is higher when the initial floc size is larger however this applies only to the initial phase and the rates become gradually synchronous among cases of different initial floc size 3 flocculation is facilitated by increase of spm concentration the increasing rate of the net flocculation rate however is one order of magnitude larger than that of spm concentration 4 a critical concentration c 50 mg l below which the impact of concentration on the equilibrium diameter of flocs d e is more than twice as strong as shear while above which d e is inversely proportional to the kolmogorov microscale η and weakly correlated to concentration was identified for area dominated by fresh water flow in other words the impact of concentration shear on d e decreases increases as concentration increases and d e is inversely proportional to η in case of high concentration 50 mg l 5 the time required to achieve d e from primary particle d p namely t f is dependent on the spm concentration c and the turbulent shear g through a relationship t f 1 c g in shallow waters dominated by barotropic flow i e vertically homogeneous and medium spm concentration level c 10 mg l such as site b1 in our study area t f 1 2 10 4 c g is found 6 in stratified waters characterized by a halocline flocculation can be divided into two vertical layers separated by the halocline flocculation can be regarded homogeneous within each layer but differs significantly between the two layers this allows simplification of numerical modelling of flocculation into two layers in 3d models for typical stratified estuarine and coastal waters 7 single class flocculation model such as the winterwerp model is useful in understanding first order flocculation processes in estuaries especially in barotropic flows however models including multiple size classes to better present psds in the two layers divided by the halocline are needed to further understand flocculation dynamics in natural estuarine and coastal waters credit authorship contribution statement ying zhang conceptualization

plays a vital role in the overall health of aquatic ecosystems an inappropriate temperature threatens fish spawning and growth and influences the irrigation and water quality of a basin caissie 2006 he et al 2019 thermal stratification widely exists in reservoirs and causes the outflow temperature to differ from the inflow temperature which imposes a negative effect on the downstream environment and ecology gao et al 2014 rheinheimer et al 2015 he et al 2018 in particular in china where many deep reservoirs with water depth of more than 100 m have been constructed in recent years the problem of significant outflow inflow temperature difference is increasingly paid large attention against the background of global warming bradford 2000 he et al 2017 generally outflow temperature is closely related to the thermal profile negatively related to the water level and positively related to the outflow discharge gao et al 2014 chen and fang 2015 he et al 2018 selective withdrawal is an effective method to regulate the outflow temperature baltar and fontane 2008 rheinheimer et al 2015 but has not been implemented in some traditionally impounded reservoirs setting up a facility for selective withdrawal in an impounded reservoir is inconvenient and costly thus reservoir re operation that considers the outflow temperature is necessary he et al 2018 meanwhile reservoir re operation can certainly alter the total power generation and downstream environmental flow thus the beneficial and ecological effects should be simultaneously considered jager and smith 2008 peralta et al 2014 guo et al 2018 because the outflow temperature problem has recently emerged in china following the construction of deep reservoirs research on moea which considers the outflow temperature problem is insufficient and thus necessary by focusing on a large deep reservoir in southwest china the present study aims to develop a multi objective optimal operating model that couples the numerical model of thermal dynamics and optimize the operating schemes by considering the power generation outflow temperature and downstream environmental flow the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 addresses the study area and setup of the numerical model of thermal dynamics and multi objective optimal operating model section 3 elaborates the optimization results under different magnitudes of inflow discharge and discussions are presented in section 4 finally section 5 summarizes the conclusions derived from this research 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and data collection the study area is the large deep sanbanxi reservoir located upstream of the yuanjiang river which is a tributary of yangtze river fig 1 because of the extreme water depth with a maximum of over 150 m he et al 2018 thermal stratification frequently occurs the measured thermal profile before the dam from january 2013 to april 2014 is shown in fig 2 this event makes the outflow temperature significantly different from the inflow temperature because of the lack of facilities for selective withdrawal thus threatening the fish habitat in the downstream reaches in particular during the storage period from march 15 to july 15 the outflow tends to be colder than the inflow threatening the spawning of local carp and catfish wang et al 2008 rolls et al 2013 li et al 2013 which are not suited for cold environment reservoir operation should not only increase the power generation and retain the environmental flow but also maintain the outflow temperature to be the same as the natural inflow temperature the characteristic parameter values of sanbanxi reservoir are listed in table 1 the daily measured inflow in 2007 2018 which was provided by the hydropower company is used to determine the iha parameters without reservoir operation and the model scenarios the measured data of the outflow discharge water level inflow temperature thermal profile and outflow temperature from january 2013 to april 2014 are used to calibrate the numerical model of the thermal dynamics fig 2 in addition the data on the reservoir volume and tail water level in 2015 approximate relationship curve of the power generation efficiency and water head are collected to determine the constraints of the optimal operating model 2 2 multi objective optimal operating model 2 2 1 nsga ii nsga ii which is combined with the pareto optimality and ga is used to develop a multi objective optimal operating model to obtain the pareto frontier among three objectives for sanbanxi reservoir it is robust and efficient in obtaining the pareto optimal solution of reservoir re operation that considers the power generation ahmadi et al 2015 stream ecological flow dai et al 2017 sediment improvement hajiabadi and zarghami 2014 deficit volume of reservoir srinivasan and kumar 2018 and water supply reliability zatarain salazar et al 2016 pareto optimality is an ideal state of resource allocation to make any individual or preference criterion better off without at least worsening one individual or preference criterion hajiabadi and zarghami 2014 yang et al 2017 srinivasan and kumar 2018 ga is a metaheuristic algorithm based on darwin s theory of evolution and relies on bio inspired genetic operators including selection crossover and mutation it is versatile and capable of parallel computing and has been widely used to generate high quality solutions to optimization and search problems peralta et al 2014 dai et al 2017 srinivasan and kumar 2018 a selection operator roulette selection is used and the selection probability of each individual is positively proportional to its fitness value non dominated number for nsga ii b crossover operator an arithmetic operator is used c mutation operator a non uniform mutation is used the nsga ii procedures are described as follows first the initial populations are randomly generated and non dominated sorting of individuals as detailed below is performed based on the function values of the multiple objectives second by employing a set of genetic operators of ga and performing non dominated sorting the individuals are being improved over a number of evolutions finally the top ranked solutions that employ the elitism characteristic after multiple generations are retained and the optimal set of non dominated individuals i e the pareto frontier is obtained fig 3 the non dominated sorting of individuals is a fast sorting process for comparison and ranking of the individuals for each individual in a certain generation the initial non dominated number is zero dominance analysis is conducted on other individuals in sequence and the non dominated number increases by one if the dominance expressed as eq 1 is achieved the higher the non dominated number of the individual is the higher is the rank of the individual in the non dominated sorting the number of non dominated individuals increases with the evolution because the search space expands and the probability of finding more potential individuals increases 1 x x 1 x 2 x n y y 1 y 2 y n x d o m y i x i y i a n d j x j y j where x and y are two individuals in the population xi and yi are the objective functions that should be minimized and n is the number of objectives the definition of dominance is similar in more than two objectives or when the objective functions need to be maximized 2 2 2 decision and state variables in the optimal operating model the simulation covers the storage period ranging from march 15 to july 15 the storage period is divided into 24 internals with six internals for each month and each internal contains 5 or 6 days fig 4 considering that the reservoir inflow slightly changes during a couple of days in the storage period and the reservoir volume is large the discrete time method for reservoir optimal operation can be feasibly applied the total number of population evolution is 600 the decision variables are outflow discharges qoutt t 1 2 24 the input variables include the inflow discharge qint and inflow temperature tint of the reservoir relationship between the water level and reservoir volume relationship between the outflow discharge and tail water level power generation efficiency curve and initial and final water levels during the storage period the state variables include the reservoir water level hret storage capacity vt tail

reservoir re operation during the storage period are as follows 1 maximize the total power generation tpg 2 maxtpg t 1 n p t 24 d t t 1 n 9 81 η t q o u t t δ h t 24 d t where pt is the station output kw dt is the duration of the tth internal days and n is the total number of internals 2 minimize the root mean square deviation between the inflow and outflow temperatures rmsdtem a drastic change in the water temperature of the basin endangers the existing fish habitat water quality and agricultural irrigation according to the downstream temperature demand of sanbanxi reservoir and to previous research soleimani et al 2016 our objective is to maintain the temperature of the upstream river in the downstream river 3 min r m s d tem 1 n t 1 n tou t t t i n t 2 where tint is the inflow temperature c at the tth internal 3 minimize the weighted aggregate ei based on the iha parameters the iha method is used to represent the environmental flow generally iha contains 33 hydrologic parameters to set up an objective function for the downstream environmental flow principal component analysis pca is used to transform the 33 hydrologic parameters into weighted aggregate ei gao et al 2009 richter et al 1996 zhang et al 2015 smaller ei indicates that the natural flow regime is less changed by the reservoir operation 4 min e i k 1 p w k a r k a u k a u k where p is the total number

regulated and au k is the value of the kth parameter under natural conditions unregulated according to the daily measured inflow data of sanbanxi reservoir during 2007 2018 which are unregulated 33 iha parameters are calculated their weights are quantified using pca and eight pcs are selected using the kaiser guttman criterion which retains pcs with λ 1 table 2 gao et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 because we study the reservoir operation during the storage period instead of the entire year or flood season the parameters with 90 day maximum 30 day maximum and mean flow in september are not considered in this work and eis are calculated based on the weights of the 30 day minimum 7 day minimum 3 day minimum mean flow in june and 90 day minimum 2 2 4 constraints 1 water balance equation 5

dynamics 2 3 1 model setup to quantify the thermal dynamics during reservoir operation the open source 1 d general lake model glm is calibrated and combined with the optimal operating model glm fully considers water mixing heat budget morphometry and meteorology of the water body and computes the vertical profiles of the temperature and density see http aed see uwa edu au research models glm it has been successfully applied to a number of ponds wetlands lakes and reservoirs hipsey et al 2014 frassl et al 2016 2 3 2 model calibration glm is calibrated using the measured data of the inflow discharge inflow temperature and outflow discharge from january 2013 to april 2014 the calculated values of the water level thermal profile before the dam and outflow temperature are compared with the measurement fig 2 the root mean square error rmse values of the water level thermal profile and outflow temperature are 0 47 m 1 46 c and 0 90 c respectively and the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values are 0 99 0 82 and 0 91 which are all larger than 0 5 indicating that the model can well simulate the seasonal pattern of water level and thermal dynamics of the reservoir 2 4 model scenario different magnitudes of inflow discharge are considered in the model scenario and the multi year daily mean of the inflow discharge measured in 2007 2018 is set as the baseline scenario the representative inflow discharges in the dry and wet years are set according to the standard for hydrological information and hydrological forecasting gb t 22482 2008 general administration of quality supervision inspection and quarantine of the people s republic of china 2008 and they are less and more than 20 of the yearly mean respectively as shown in fig 6 3 results 3 1 optimized operating schemes for a single objective the operating schemes of the reservoir are optimized based on the multi objective optimal operating model and the best individuals for a single objective in a normal year are extracted table 3 and fig 7 3 1 1 individual of maximum tpg the slope of the outflow discharge curve sodc is large 1 92 m3 s d with less water released at the early stage and more water released at the later stage of the storage period which increases the average water level 458 3 m power generation efficiency and tpg the maximum tpg of sanbanxi reservoir reaches 7 43 108 kw h during the storage period meanwhile the outflow discharge of a high sodc creates a large ei and the outflow temperature is low because the water level is high and rmsdtem is large 3 1 2 individual of minimum rmsdtem in contrast to the individual of maximum tpg the sodc of minimum rmsdtem is small 1 64 m3 s d with more water released at the early stage and less water released at the later stage during the storage period which decreases the water level 451 1 m elevates the outflow temperature and decreases rmsdtem meanwhile the outflow discharge of a small sodc creates large ei and the tpg is low because of the low water level and power generation efficiency by changing the operating scheme rmsdtem can be reduced by 1 60 c from 5 99 to 4 39 c which indicates the effectiveness of the reservoir re operation in mitigating the outflow temperature problem 3 1 3 individual of minimum ei minimum ei is obtained when the outflow discharge is relatively even to make the outflow process approach the inflow the average water level 455 3 m sodc 0 27 m3 s d outflow temperature tpg 7 06 108 kw h and rmsdtem 5 26 c during the simulation period have medium values compared with those of the individuals of maximum tpg and minimum rmsdtem 3 2 pareto frontier the pareto frontiers of the multi objective re operation are obtained using moea fig 8 the individuals of large tpg tend to appear with large rmsdtem and ei those in small rmsdtem tend to appear with small tpg and large ei and those in small ei tend to appear with medium tpg and rmsdtem for the individuals in the pareto frontier the change patterns of tpg and rmsdtem both show a good relationship with the sodc whereas the change pattern of ei shows no obvious relationship fig 9 contradictions exist between the objectives of maximizing tpg and minimizing rmsdtem and rmsdtem can be reduced by 1 60 c from 5 99 to 4 39 c at the expense of decreasing tpg from 7 43 108 to 6 56 108 kw h 11 8 under a large sodc with more water released at the later stage and less water released at the early stage of the simulation period the average water level and water head power generation efficiency and tpg increase meanwhile an increased water level reduces the outflow temperature and increases rmsdtem and vice versa a small ei appears under a medium sodc approximately from 0 4 to 0 6 m3 s d as the sodc increases from 2 to 0 4 m3 s d both tpg and rmsdtem increase and ei becomes smaller as the sodc increases from 0 6 to 2 m3 s d tpg rmsdtem and ei all increase in summary the outflow discharge must be small at the early stage of the simulation period and large at the later stage to increase the sodc when tpg is preferably considered over rmsdtem and vice versa an even outflow process corresponds to smaller ei and hydrological alteration 3 3 influence of magnitude of the inflow discharge for the individual of maximum tpg the outflow discharge further increases at the later stage of the simulation period when the yearly inflow discharge increases the sodcs are 1 57 1 92 and 3 24 m3 s d in the dry normal and wet years respectively as shown in fig 7b for the individual of minimum rmsdtem the outflow discharge further increases at the early stage of the simulation period and its temporal distribution becomes more uneven the sodcs are 1 18 1 64 and 2 11 m3 s d in the dry normal and wet years respectively for the individual of minimum ei the sodc increases from 0 21 to 0 81 m3 s d from the dry year to the wet year in summary as the yearly inflow increases the regulation capacity of the reservoir re operation for the outflow discharge substantially increases the absolute value of the sodc for the best individuals for a single objective becomes larger and the temporal distribution of the outflow discharge becomes more uneven the pareto frontiers under different inflow discharges are extracted as shown in fig 8 as the yearly inflow increases the outflow discharge and tpg increases meanwhile a larger inflow substantially elevates the average outflow temperature and decreases rmsdtem hence the location of the pareto frontier moves toward larger tpg and smaller rmsdtem moreover the temporal distribution of the outflow discharge becomes more uneven and the range of tpg and rmsdtem in the pareto frontier expands in the dry normal and wet years the ranges of tpg values are 0 60 108 0 97 108 and 1 44 108 kw h respectively the ranges of rmsdtem values are 1 05 1 59 and 2 36 c respectively and the ranges ei values remain basically unchanged moreover as the yearly inflow discharge increases the range values of the medium sodc where the minimum ei can be obtained increases as follow in dry normal and wet years they are from 0 1 to 0 4 m3 s d 0 4 to 0 6 m3 s d and 0 6 to 1 2 m3 s d respectively 4 discussion the results of the reservoir optimal operation that considers the thermal structure of sanbanxi reservoir also provide management information to other reservoirs especially for the deep reservoirs in southwest china with outflow temperature problems gao et al 2014 and chen and fang 2015 demonstrated that the outflow temperature of other reservoirs is closely related to the thermal profile negatively related to the water level and positively related to the outflow discharge the change pattern of the outflow temperature is the same as that of sanbanxi reservoir he et al 2018 meanwhile a higher water level generally increases the water head and power generation efficiency in most reservoirs ma et al 2013 guo et al 2018 and a very uneven hydrological characteristic results in larger hydrological alteration gao et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 hence the change pattern of tpg rmsdtem and ei in the pareto frontier in the other reservoirs is believed to be consistent with that in sanbanxi reservoir in addition to the trade off operating schemes in the pareto frontier the sodc parameter can practically provide technical support to administrators for reservoir re operation in practice administrators can achieve the desired objectives by regulating the temporal distribution of the outflow discharge under different sodcs generally a large sodc results in high tpg a small sodc results in low rmsdtem and a medium sodc results in low ei for sanbanxi reservoir the medium sodcs range from 0 1 to 0 4 m3 s d 0 4 to 0 6 m3 s d and 0 6 to 1 2 m3 s d in dry normal and wet years respectively meanwhile reservoir re operation incorporating location specific indicators of ecological alteration should be developed the hydrological and hydraulic iha parameters are approximations of ecologically beneficial flows that do not directly map to biotic health and necessarily result in the best flow regime for specific ecosystem because this paper focuses on the immediate need of outflow temperature at present and local data requirement for other ecological factors are unavailable for sanbanxi reservoir the iha method is used to represent the hydrologic alteration of reservoir re operation in a further study other factors involving the local ecosystem such as sediment and water quality can be considered 5 conclusions this work has developed a multi objective optimal operating model that combined the nsga ii and glm analyzed the effect of reservoir re operation on mitigating the outflow temperature problem and obtained the trade off relationships among tpg rmsdtem and ei using pareto frontiers this study demonstrated the following 1 a contradiction exists between the objectives of maximizing tpg and minimizing rmsdtem and rmsdtem can be reduced by 1 60 c from 5 99 to 4 39 c through re operation at the expense of decreasing tpg in sanbanxi reservoir from 7 43 108 to 6 56 108 kw h 11 8 in a normal year 2 the optimized operating schemes of the reservoir are extracted as pareto frontiers to support reservoir re operation and the sodc parameter can practically determine the re operation scheme a large sodc results in high tpg a small sodc results in low rmsdtem and a medium sodc results in low ei the medium sodcs range from 0 1 to 0 4 m3 s d 0 4 to 0 6 m3 s d and 0 6 to 1 2 m3 s d in dry normal and wet years respectively 3 as the yearly inflow increases the absolute value of the sodc for the best individuals for a single objective becomes larger and the temporal distribution of the outflow discharge becomes more uneven the ranges of the tpg and rmsdtem in the pareto frontier expand in dry normal and wet years the ranges of tpg are 0 60 108 0 97 108 and 1 44 108 kwh respectively those of rmsdtem are 1 05 1 59 and 2 36 c respectively and those of ei remains basically unchanged with the building of more deep reservoirs and more attention being focused on water environment and ecology research on multi objective optimal operation that considers the thermal structure and environmental flow will continue especially under the challenge of climate change credit authorship contribution statement wei he conceptualization

however the outflow temperature has not been considered focusing on this deficiency we considered sanbanxi reservoir as a case study and used the non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii by combining it with the calibrated 1 d general lake model the trade off relationships among three objectives namely total power generation tpg root mean square deviation between the inflow and outflow

15 the results demonstrated the following 1 through reservoir re operation rmsdtem could be reduced by 1 60 c from 5 99 to 4 39 c at the expense of reducing tpg from 7 43 108 to 6 56 108 kw h 11 8 during a normal year 2 the optimized operating schemes were extracted as pareto frontiers and the slope of the outflow discharge curve sodc could be a useful parameter for determining the operating scheme in practice a large sodc yielded high tpg a small sodc resulted in low rmsdtem and a medium sodc yielded minimum ei the medium sodcs ranged from 0 1 to 0 4 m3 s d 0 4 to 0 6 m3 s d and 0 6 to 1 2 m3 s d for dry normal and wet years respectively 3 as the yearly inflow increased the absolute value of the sodc for the best individuals for a single objective became larger the range of tpg and rmsdtem in the pareto frontier expanded and that of ei remained basically unchanged the results of the sanbanxi reservoir can be applied to other reservoirs to support reservoir re operation

change and increased energy demands zatarain salazar et al 2016 sun et al 2018 wild et al 2019 trade off conflicts often exist among different objectives and one objective can be achieved or approached at the expense of another objective the multi objective optimal operation aims to maximize the comprehensive benefits of a reservoir basin and has been extensively conducted by considering

environmental flow objective can be represented using a weighted aggregate eco index ei based on the iha parameters gao et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 moreover focusing on heavily revised rivers the designer flow and functional flow are further proposed to adapt to the needs of human regulation and water allocation and are practical to maximize natural capital and meanwhile support the economic recreational and cultural functions acreman et al 2014 yarnell et al 2015 to improve the downstream ecosystem ecological re operation of reservoirs has been recently paid attention to which mainly includes two aspects first by focusing on the demand of water quantity for the downstream reaches of a reservoir the environmental flow indicators are set as constraints or objective functions in the moea shiau and wu 2007 pasha et al 2015 dai et al 2017 guo et al 2018 through ecological re operation using moea environmental flow is achieved the fish habitat downstream the reservoir is improved and the hydropower and ecological outcomes are balanced wild et al 2019 second optimization of the water quality of the reservoir is considered the calculation models of the water quality such as the

2016 are embedded into the optimal operating model as an objective function or constraints and the re operation schemes are estimated to improve the water quality of a reservoir water temperature plays a vital role in the overall health of aquatic ecosystems an inappropriate temperature threatens fish spawning and growth and influences the irrigation and water quality of a basin caissie 2006 he et al 2019 thermal stratification widely exists in reservoirs and causes the outflow temperature to differ from the inflow temperature which imposes a negative effect on the downstream environment and ecology gao et al 2014 rheinheimer et al 2015 he et al 2018 in particular in china where many deep reservoirs with water depth of more than 100 m have been constructed in recent years the problem of significant outflow inflow temperature difference is increasingly paid large attention against the background of global warming bradford 2000 he et al 2017 generally outflow temperature is closely related to the thermal profile negatively related to the water level and positively related to the outflow discharge gao et al 2014 chen and fang 2015 he et al 2018 selective withdrawal is an effective method to regulate the outflow temperature baltar and fontane 2008 rheinheimer et al 2015 but has not been implemented in some traditionally impounded reservoirs setting up a facility for selective withdrawal in an impounded reservoir is inconvenient and costly thus reservoir re operation that considers the outflow temperature is necessary he et al 2018 meanwhile reservoir re operation can certainly alter the total power generation and downstream environmental flow thus the beneficial and ecological effects should be simultaneously considered jager and smith 2008 peralta et al 2014 guo et al 2018 because the outflow temperature problem has recently emerged in china following the construction of deep reservoirs research on moea which considers the outflow temperature problem is insufficient and thus necessary by focusing on a large deep reservoir in southwest china the present study aims to develop a multi objective optimal operating model that couples the numerical model of thermal dynamics and optimize the operating schemes by considering the power generation outflow temperature and downstream environmental flow the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 addresses the study area and setup of the numerical model of thermal dynamics and multi objective optimal operating model section 3 elaborates the optimization results under different magnitudes of inflow discharge and discussions are presented in section 4 finally section 5 summarizes the conclusions derived from this research 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and data collection the study area is the large deep sanbanxi reservoir located upstream of the yuanjiang river which is a tributary of yangtze river fig 1 because of the extreme water depth with a maximum of over 150 m he et al 2018 thermal stratification frequently occurs the measured thermal profile before the dam from january 2013 to april 2014 is shown in fig 2 this event makes the outflow temperature significantly different from the inflow temperature because of the lack of facilities for selective withdrawal thus threatening the fish habitat in the downstream reaches in particular during the storage period from march 15 to july 15 the outflow tends to be colder than the inflow threatening the spawning of local carp and catfish wang et al 2008 rolls et al 2013 li et al 2013 which are not suited for cold environment reservoir operation should not only increase the power generation and retain the environmental flow but also maintain the outflow temperature to be the same as the natural inflow temperature the characteristic parameter values of sanbanxi reservoir are listed in table 1 the daily measured inflow in 2007 2018 which was provided by the hydropower company is used to determine the iha parameters without reservoir operation and the model scenarios the measured data of the outflow discharge water level inflow temperature thermal profile and outflow temperature from january 2013 to april 2014 are used to calibrate the numerical model of the thermal dynamics fig 2 in addition the data on the reservoir volume and tail water level in 2015 approximate relationship curve of the

probability of each individual is positively proportional to its fitness value non dominated number for nsga ii b crossover operator an arithmetic operator is used c mutation operator a non uniform mutation is used the nsga ii procedures are described as follows first the initial populations are randomly generated and non dominated sorting of individuals as detailed below is performed based on the function values of the multiple objectives second by employing a set of genetic operators of ga and performing non dominated sorting the individuals are being improved over a number of evolutions finally the top ranked solutions that employ the elitism characteristic after multiple generations are retained and the optimal set of non dominated individuals i e the pareto frontier is obtained fig 3 the non dominated sorting of individuals is a fast sorting process for comparison and ranking of the individuals for each individual in a certain generation the initial non dominated number is zero dominance analysis is conducted on other individuals in sequence and the non dominated number increases by one if the dominance expressed as eq 1 is achieved the higher the non dominated number of the individual is the higher is the rank of the individual in the non dominated sorting the number of non dominated individuals increases with the evolution because the search space expands and the probability of finding more potential individuals increases 1 x x 1 x 2 x n y y 1 y 2 y n x d o m y i x i y i a n d j x j y j where x and y are two individuals in the population xi and yi are the objective functions that should be minimized and n is the number of objectives the definition of dominance is similar in more than two objectives or when the objective functions need to be maximized 2 2 2 decision and state variables in the optimal operating model the simulation covers the storage period ranging from march 15 to july 15 the storage period is divided into 24 internals with six internals for each month and each internal contains 5 or 6 days fig 4 considering that the reservoir inflow slightly changes during a couple of days in the storage period and the reservoir volume is large the discrete time method for reservoir optimal operation can be feasibly applied the total number of population evolution is 600 the decision variables are outflow discharges qoutt t 1 2 24 the

values are 0 99 0 82 and 0 91 which are all larger than 0 5 indicating that the model can well simulate the seasonal pattern of water level and thermal dynamics of the reservoir 2 4 model scenario different magnitudes of inflow discharge are considered in the model scenario and the multi year daily mean of the inflow discharge measured in 2007 2018 is set as the baseline scenario the representative inflow discharges in the dry and wet years are set according to the standard for hydrological information and hydrological forecasting gb t 22482 2008 general administration of quality supervision inspection and quarantine of the people s republic of china 2008 and they are less and more than 20 of the yearly mean respectively as shown in fig 6 3 results 3 1 optimized operating schemes for a single objective the operating schemes of the reservoir are optimized based on the multi objective optimal operating model and the best individuals for a single objective in a normal year are extracted table 3 and fig 7 3 1 1 individual of maximum tpg the slope of the outflow discharge curve sodc is large 1 92 m3 s d with less water released at the early stage and more water released at the later stage of the storage period which increases the average water level 458 3 m power generation efficiency and tpg the maximum tpg of sanbanxi reservoir reaches 7 43 108 kw h during the storage period meanwhile the outflow discharge of a high sodc creates a large ei and the outflow temperature is low because the water level is high and rmsdtem is large 3 1 2 individual of minimum rmsdtem in contrast to the individual of maximum tpg the sodc of minimum rmsdtem is small 1 64 m3 s d with more water released at the early stage and less water released at the later stage during the storage period which decreases the water level 451 1 m elevates the outflow temperature and decreases rmsdtem meanwhile the outflow discharge of a small sodc creates large ei and the tpg is low because of the low water level and power generation efficiency by changing the operating scheme rmsdtem can be reduced by 1 60 c from 5 99 to 4 39 c which indicates the effectiveness of the reservoir re operation in mitigating the outflow temperature problem 3 1 3 individual of minimum ei minimum ei is obtained when the outflow discharge is relatively even to make the outflow process approach the inflow the average water level 455 3 m sodc 0 27 m3 s d outflow temperature tpg 7 06 108 kw h and rmsdtem 5 26 c during the simulation period have medium values compared with those of the individuals of maximum tpg and minimum rmsdtem 3 2 pareto frontier the pareto frontiers of the multi objective re operation are obtained using moea fig 8 the individuals of large tpg tend to appear with large rmsdtem and ei those in small rmsdtem tend to appear with small tpg and large ei and those in small ei tend to appear with medium tpg and rmsdtem for the individuals in the pareto frontier the change patterns of tpg and rmsdtem both show a good relationship with the sodc whereas the change pattern of ei shows no obvious relationship fig 9 contradictions exist between the objectives of maximizing tpg and minimizing rmsdtem and rmsdtem can be reduced by 1 60 c from 5 99 to 4 39 c at the expense of decreasing tpg from 7 43 108 to 6 56 108 kw h 11 8 under a large sodc with more water released at the later stage and less water released at the early stage of the simulation period the average water level and water head power generation efficiency and tpg increase meanwhile an increased water level reduces the outflow temperature and increases rmsdtem and vice versa a small ei appears under a medium sodc approximately from 0 4 to 0 6 m3 s d as the sodc increases from 2 to 0 4 m3 s d both tpg and rmsdtem increase and ei becomes smaller as the sodc increases from 0 6 to 2 m3 s d tpg rmsdtem and ei all increase in summary the outflow discharge must be small at the early stage of the simulation period and large at the later stage to increase the sodc when tpg is preferably considered over rmsdtem and vice versa an even outflow process corresponds to smaller ei and hydrological alteration 3 3 influence of magnitude of the inflow discharge for the individual of maximum tpg the outflow discharge further increases at the later stage of the simulation period when the yearly inflow discharge increases the sodcs are 1 57 1 92 and 3 24 m3 s d in the dry normal and wet years respectively as shown in fig 7b for the individual of minimum rmsdtem the outflow discharge further increases at the early stage of the simulation period and its temporal distribution becomes more uneven the sodcs are 1 18 1 64 and 2 11 m3 s d in the dry normal and wet years respectively for the individual of minimum ei the sodc increases from 0 21 to 0 81 m3 s d from the dry year to the wet year in summary as the yearly inflow increases the regulation capacity of the reservoir re operation for the outflow discharge substantially increases the absolute value of the sodc for the best individuals for a single objective becomes larger and the temporal distribution of the outflow discharge becomes more uneven the pareto frontiers under different inflow discharges are extracted as shown in fig 8 as the yearly inflow increases the outflow discharge and tpg increases meanwhile a larger inflow substantially elevates the average outflow temperature and decreases rmsdtem hence the location of the pareto frontier moves toward larger tpg and smaller rmsdtem moreover the temporal distribution of the outflow discharge becomes more uneven and the range of tpg and rmsdtem in the pareto frontier expands in the dry normal and wet years the ranges of tpg values are 0 60 108 0 97 108 and 1 44 108 kw h respectively the ranges of rmsdtem values are 1 05 1 59 and 2 36 c respectively and the ranges ei values remain basically unchanged moreover as the yearly inflow discharge increases the range values of the medium sodc where the minimum ei can be obtained increases as follow in dry normal and wet years they are from 0 1 to 0 4 m3 s d 0 4 to 0 6 m3 s d and 0 6 to 1 2 m3 s d respectively 4 discussion the results of the reservoir optimal operation that considers the thermal structure of sanbanxi reservoir also provide management information to other reservoirs especially for the deep reservoirs in southwest china with outflow temperature problems gao et al 2014 and chen and fang 2015 demonstrated that the outflow temperature of other reservoirs is closely related to the thermal profile negatively related to the water level and positively related to the outflow discharge the change pattern of the outflow temperature is the same as that of sanbanxi reservoir he et al 2018 meanwhile a higher water level generally increases the water head and power generation efficiency in most reservoirs ma et al 2013 guo et al 2018 and a very uneven hydrological characteristic results in larger hydrological alteration gao et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 hence the change pattern of tpg rmsdtem and ei in the pareto frontier in the other reservoirs is believed to be consistent with that in sanbanxi reservoir in addition to the trade off operating schemes in the pareto frontier the sodc parameter can practically provide technical support to administrators for reservoir re operation in practice administrators can achieve the desired objectives by regulating the temporal distribution of the outflow discharge under different sodcs generally a large sodc results in high tpg a small sodc results in low rmsdtem and a medium sodc results in low ei for sanbanxi reservoir the medium sodcs range from 0 1 to 0 4 m3 s d 0 4 to 0 6 m3 s d and 0 6 to 1 2 m3 s d in dry normal and wet years respectively meanwhile reservoir re operation incorporating location specific indicators of ecological alteration should be developed the hydrological and hydraulic iha parameters are approximations of ecologically beneficial flows that do not directly map to biotic health and necessarily result in the best flow regime for specific ecosystem because this paper focuses on the immediate need of outflow temperature at present and local data requirement for other ecological factors are unavailable for sanbanxi reservoir the iha method is used to represent the hydrologic alteration of reservoir re operation in a further study other factors involving the local ecosystem such as sediment and water quality can be considered 5 conclusions this work has developed a multi objective optimal operating model that combined the nsga ii and glm analyzed the effect of reservoir re operation on mitigating the outflow temperature problem and obtained the trade off relationships among tpg rmsdtem and ei using pareto frontiers this study demonstrated the following 1 a contradiction exists between the objectives of maximizing tpg and minimizing rmsdtem and rmsdtem can be reduced by 1 60 c from 5 99 to 4 39 c through re operation at the expense of decreasing tpg in sanbanxi reservoir from 7 43 108 to 6 56 108 kw h 11 8 in a normal year 2 the optimized operating schemes of the reservoir are extracted as pareto frontiers to support reservoir re operation and the sodc parameter can practically determine the re operation scheme a large sodc results in high tpg a small sodc results in low rmsdtem and a medium sodc results in low ei the medium sodcs range from 0 1 to 0 4 m3 s d 0 4 to 0 6 m3 s d and 0 6 to 1 2 m3 s d in dry normal and wet years respectively 3 as the yearly inflow increases the absolute value of the sodc for the best individuals for a single objective becomes larger and the temporal distribution of the outflow discharge becomes more uneven the ranges of the tpg and rmsdtem in the pareto frontier expand in dry normal and wet years the ranges of tpg are 0 60 108 0 97 108 and 1 44 108 kwh respectively those of rmsdtem are 1 05 1 59 and 2 36 c respectively and those of ei remains basically unchanged with the building of more deep reservoirs and more attention being focused on water environment and ecology research on multi objective optimal

5513,well designed and implemented green infrastructure gi can help to recover the natural hydrologic regime of urban areas a large scale gi planning requires a good understanding of the impact of gi spatial allocation on surface subsurface hydrologic dynamics this study firstly developed a coupled surface subsurface hydrological model swmm modflow that can simulate fine temporal scale two way interactions between gi and groundwater at catchment scale the model was calibrated and validated using the monitoring data at one urban catchment within kitsap county wa us based on the validated model a series of hypothetical simulations was then performed to evaluate how spatial allocation of bioretention cells bcs one type of gi influences and correlates with surface runoff and groundwater table dynamics the spatial allocation was represented by implementation ratio i e area aggregation level i e density and location of bcs the hydrologic dynamics were quantified by peak and volume reductions of surface runoff as well as groundwater table rise and standard deviation of groundwater levels a small number of bcs can raise groundwater table locally and regionally however it may not affect the spatial uniformity of groundwater levels represented as the standard deviation of groundwater levels if being properly allocated although the impact of aggregation level of bcs was relatively low compared to the implementation ratio and relative location of bcs more distributed bcs resulted in lower peak groundwater table rises but higher temporally averaged groundwater table rises allocating bcs upstream resulted in higher groundwater table rises regionally which is recommended for areas of deeper groundwater tables while allocating bcs downstream is more recommended for areas of shallower groundwater tables bcs of greater surface runoff control efficiencies lead to higher groundwater table rises which highlights the importance of considering the tradeoff between surface runoff control and groundwater protection in gi planning keywords low impact development bioretention cell stormwater management integrated modeling groundwater modeling urban planning 1 introduction excessive urbanization has significantly deteriorated the natural hydrological ecological and biological regimes there is now a general consensus that a more sustainable and environmental friendly development approach is needed song 2005 green infrastructure gi is therefore proposed under this cognitive revolution brown et al 2009 however different people may define gi differently for people concerned about hydrology and stormwater management e g hydrologists urban drainage engineers gi is analogous to some other terms e g low impact development lid sustainable urban drainage system suds and water sensitive urban design wsud which represent a group of semi natural spatially distributed stormwater management practices potter 2006 young et al 2014 fletcher et al 2015 compared to traditional drainage systems they possess more diverse functionalities which include collecting storing infiltrating rainfall runoff and recovering natural hydrological cycle chui et al 2016 representative practices include bioretention cells porous pavements green roofs etc while for other people e g landscape designers urban planners gi can include forests or other green spaces that could be better in providing other environmental benefits such as urban heat island mitigation and biodiversity increase ec 2013 zhang and chui 2019 the gi in this study follows the first definition having a main focus on hydrology and stormwater management among all the benefits that gi can provide e g peak runoff and non point source pollution control groundwater recharge is the one that attracts relatively little attention jefferson et al 2017 sohn et al 2019 one possible reason is that recharging groundwater using gi normally comes with many challenges which are prominent in shallow groundwater areas particularly first a groundwater mound can form when the recharge rate exceeds the dissipation rate of groundwater this may slow down or inhibit surface infiltration and increase the risk of groundwater contamination due to a shorter traveling distance and more carried pollutants fischer et al 2003 datry et al 2004 göbel et al 2004 endreny and collins 2009 machusick et al 2011 stewart et al 2017 zhang and chui 2017 zhang and chui 2018a however recharging groundwater using gi can increase the baseflow recover the hydrological cycle and help maintain urban water supplies newcomer et al 2014 bhaskar et al 2016 2018 bradshaw and luthy 2017 it should therefore be promoted if given appropriate conditions e g suitable subsurface soil properties and relatively deep groundwater table trinh and chui 2013 chui and trinh 2016 for the reasons aforementioned the objectives and constraints related to groundwater recharge should be thoroughly considered in gi planning however maximizing the control in surface runoff often remains the dominant objective in gi implementation as reviewed by zhang and chui 2018b many studies considered peak and volume control of surface runoff e g perez pedini et al 2005 damodaram and zechman 2012 sebti et al 2016 giacomoni and joseph 2017 lim and welty 2017 voter and loheide 2018 while many others considered pollution mitigation of surface runoff e g maringanti et al 2009 rodriguez et al 2011 chiang et al 2014 chen et al 2015 2016 and some examined the two aspects together lee et al 2012 liu et al 2016a 2016b mao et al 2017 xu et al 2018 regarding works relating gi and groundwater some studies assessed the response of shallow groundwater to gi endreny and collins 2009 trinh and chui 2013 chui and trinh 2016 zheng et al 2018 also some proposed recommendations about the suitable distance between gi and groundwater table locatelli et al 2015 zhang and chui 2017 muñoz carpena et al 2018 lauvernet and muñoz carpena 2018 however to the best of the authors knowledge the impact of gi spatial allocation on shallow groundwater table dynamics remains to be evaluated the spatial allocation of gi is hypothesized to affect the groundwater table dynamics in a number of aspects based on the study of zhang and chui 2018b the spatial allocation of gi can be mainly represented by implementation ratio i e the area aggregation level i e density and location of gi practices first the implementation ratio of gi is one of the major factors because it determines the amount of rainfall that can be infiltrated with a higher implementation ratio more water can be recharged and the groundwater table should rise higher second the aggregation level of gi is also influential because more aggregated gi practices can infiltrate more water locally and result in localized groundwater mound as reported by endreny and collins 2009 third the location of gi also matters as the land use and geologic conditions e g hydraulic properties of in situ soil groundwater table depth can be very different at different locations more specifically in areas of higher imperviousness more permeable soils and shallower groundwater tables gi can affect the groundwater table dynamics more due to more surface runoff generated higher infiltration and recharge rate vice versa the concept of variable source area well explains the impacts of these factors miles and band 2015 lim 2016 some studies determined the spatial allocation of gi only based on these land use and geologic factors by using spatial analysis tools without hydrological analysis martin mikle et al 2015 johnson and sample 2017 although there are many different numerical models that can simulate the hydrological processes of gi they all have their limitations in simulating gi in shallow groundwater environment as reviewed by zhang et al 2018 variably saturated porous media software e g comsol multiphysics vs2d hydrus 1d 2d 3d have been used in some cases he and davis 2010 stewart et al 2017 zhang and chui 2017 however they generally cannot handle or are not suitable for catchment scale studies because they simplify or cannot simulate rainfall runoff generation and surface runoff routing in addition some surface subsurface hydrological models e g modhms mike she and velma can better simulate rainfall runoff processes and are more widely used at the catchment scale barron et al 2013 trinh and chui 2013 locatelli et al 2017 hoghooghi et al 2018 however they mostly operate in relatively coarse temporal and spatial resolutions which are beyond the normal scale of each individual gi practice thus some time and space sensitive hydrological processes important to gi are simplified finally many of them are commercial and non open source software which make them harder to be improved or integrated with other tools e g data analysis and optimization tools and both types of models cannot simulate urban hydraulics e g storm sewer systems which limit their usages in urban areas as an urban hydrologic hydraulic model swmm has been widely adopted to simulate gi including assessing the hydrological and water quality treatment performance of gi qin et al 2013 palla and gnecco 2015 chui et al 2016 jayasooriya et al 2016 avellaneda et al 2017 kong et al 2017 as well as evaluating the optimal designs and allocations of gi elliott et al 2009 lucas and sample 2015 giacomoni and joseph 2017 macro et al 2019 yang and chui 2018a b zischg et al 2018 however swmm is not as capable in simulating the subsurface hydrological performance of gi first it highly simplifies the simulation of unsaturated and saturated flows by assuming a linearized soil water retention curve second it neglects the impact of groundwater on the hydrological processes of gi e g exfiltration percolation underdrain flow lee et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 to partially overcome these deficiencies zhang et al 2018 had improved swmm by creating an interface to incorporate groundwater levels into the simulation of gi and it had been tested that the modified swmm is appropriate for simulating the performance of gi in shallow groundwater environments however it cannot simulate groundwater dynamics but requires the direct input of groundwater levels which greatly hinders its application as a follow up study of zhang et al 2018 this study integrated the modified swmm named swmm lid gw with modflow to develop a loosely coupled surface subsurface hydrological model swmm modflow it is loosely coupled because the structures of two models were kept unchanged and the two models were integrated through external file input output without internal function calls the coupling approach utilized in this study is similar to that of zhang et al 2018 however the groundwater dynamics were simulated instead of being inputted and the two way interaction between gi and groundwater was realized the model was calibrated and validated using the monitoring data in one urban catchment at silverdale washington state of the united states then using bioretention cell bc that allows exfiltration as a representative gi a series of hypothetical scenarios of different spatial allocation patterns of bcs was simulated which covered different implementation ratios aggregation levels and locations of bcs within the same catchment furthermore the influence of spatial allocation of bcs on surface runoff and groundwater table dynamics was evaluated finally the correlations between surface runoff and groundwater table dynamics were examined it should be noted that this study focused more on groundwater rather than surface runoff dynamics because they were less studied and understood 2 methodology 2 1 modeling framework of swmm modflow a two way coupled surface subsurface hydrological model swmm modflow was developed and utilized it is a loosely coupled model linking swmm and modflow and its structure is shown in fig 1 retaining the main structures of swmm and modflow the coupling was performed through file input and output without internal function calls between the source codes of two models more specifically surface infiltration rate in non gi pervious areas or exfiltration rate at the bottom of gi is sent from swmm to modflow while groundwater table depth is sent from modflow to swmm fig 1 based on the groundwater table depth obtained from modflow the hydrological processes of gi i e underdrain flow exfiltration rate and surface runoff are calculated using the equations of swmm lid gw developed by zhang et al 2018 eqs 1 and 2 furthermore modflow can also simulate groundwater table dynamics after receiving the infiltration and exfiltration rates from swmm the governing equation of groundwater flow in modflow is shown in eq 3 below 1 f drain a h ws h offset b i f h ws h gw a h gw h offset b i f h ws h gw where f drain means the rate of underdrain flow a and b are the two coefficients of underdrain which depend on the size and density of holes on the underdrain respectively h offset is the distance between the underdrain and the bottom of gi h ws is the depth of water storage within the gi and h gw is the distance between the groundwater table and the bottom of gi 2 f exfil θ s θ θ s θ i k s where f exfil means the exfiltration rate k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the in situ soils θ s and θ i are the saturated and initial moisture contents of in situ soils θ is the current moisture content of in situ soil near the bottom of gi which depends on groundwater table depth basically the exfiltration rate varies with the groundwater table depth and soil moisture of in situ soils it equals to k s when the soil moisture of in situ soils equals to θ i when there is no groundwater mound and reduces to zero when the soil gets saturated when groundwater table rises to or above the bottom of gi the initial moisture content of in situ soils θ i is updated every time step based on the groundwater table depth nearby gi some of the variables mentioned above are illustrated in fig 2 it should be noted that this equation characterizes groundwater mounding in a simplified manner which thus has some limitations first it is more appropriate for event based simulations due to the inclusion of θ i it however has been demonstrated to be suitable for long term simulations locatelli et al 2015 in addition due to the inclusion of θ i the equation may slightly overestimate the exfiltration rate because the exfiltration rate can be close to k s even when groundwater table is shallow 3 x k x h x y k y h y z k z h z s s h t where k x k y k z represent the hydraulic conductivity in x y and z directions s s represents the specific storage and h represents the average groundwater head of grids beneath gi which is used to calculate the soil moisture at the bottom of gi i e θ in eq 2 through the van genuchten equation overall the coupled model can characterize the variations of hydrological processes of gi with groundwater table depth when groundwater table fluctuates the underdrain flow and exfiltration rate can vary as characterized by the equations above as a result the percolation rate from soil layer to storage layer the surface infiltration rate and the rate of surface runoff may also vary according to the water balance inside the different layers of gi for example when groundwater table is shallower than the bottom of gi and also the underdrain the exfiltration stops and the underdrain flow is governed by groundwater table instead of percolation rate thus the maximum percolation rate and surface infiltration rate should be equal to the rate of underdrain flow more details about these settings can be found in zhang et al 2018 the data exchange mentioned above is governed by a matlab controller the detailed mechanisms of the matlab controller and the data exchange are also shown in fig 1 the controller firstly realizes temporal synchronization between two models using the hot start functions which allow the two models to pause and re start from previous time step when necessary more specifically one simulation is segmented into multiple time steps after the completion of each time step one model was paused with results of this time step stored into external hot start files and also sent to the controller for processing then the other model is activated by the controller after receiving the processed results from the hot start files fig 1 note that the hot start files are normally used to define the initial conditions of a new simulation however in this study the hot start files were used to store the results of every time step and enable external data transfer between the two models the hot start function in swmm had already been improved by zhang et al 2018 which supported the storage and extraction of gi simulation results including soil moisture of the soil zone water depth at the surface and water depth inside the storage layer into the external hot start files fig 1 however there is no similar built in function in the current modflow thus a hot start function was developed in modflow by transferring and modifying the source code from gsflow which is another surface subsurface hydrological model coupled by precipitation runoff modeling system prms and modflow regan et al 2015 with similar functionality as that of swmm the hot start function of modflow can store and extract groundwater heads and percolation rates in different layers of grids at the end and start of each time step details about this hot start function in swmm and modflow can be found in zhang et al 2018 and regan et al 2015 respectively the controller performs the spatial mapping between two models by processing the results from each model into organized and transferable formats this is necessary because the spatial representation approaches of the two models are completely different swmm is a sub catchment based spatially lumped model but modflow is a grid based finite difference model as shown in fig 3 the spatial mapping works as follows on one hand the controller extracts infiltration rate of pervious areas or exfiltration rate of gi from the output files of swmm then discretizes them into matrixes and updates the input files of modflow figs 1 and 3 on the other hand the controller extracts matrixes of groundwater heads from the output files of modflow modifies them into groundwater table depths then lumps into sub catchment based values and updates the input files of swmm figs 1 and 3 although the location of gi within sub catchments cannot be specified in swmm they can be accurately located in modflow yellow rectangles in fig 3 through three indicators i e index of sub catchment index of gi within each sub catchment and coordinates of grids of gi this mapping process is schematically illustrated in fig 3 2 2 study area and data an urban catchment in the silverdale kitsap county washington state of the united states was selected as the study area fig 4 the study area is 197 ha total in size with around 80 urbanized which is located on the kitsap peninsula figs 4a and 4b lying at the northern tip of the dyes inlet connected to the puget sound the area is of equable oceanic climate with generally mild temperatures and moderate to heavy precipitation sceva 1957 it has warm dry summers and relatively mild winters the precipitation was averaged at 1103 6 mm year with 161 precipitation days and the reference evapotranspiration et was around 741 7 mm year during 1991 2018 the catchment was located at one pleistocene depositional unit of kitsap county the major soil types of the area include but are not limited to bedrock advanced outwash gravels lacustrine peat and till based on local geologic survey sceva 1957 and the ssurgo soil database nrcs and usda 2017 the northern and western parts of the catchment are mountainous with an average slope of 10 14 so the highest locations were assigned as the domain boundaries in these two directions which were assumed as no flow boundaries in the groundwater model i e the light grey boundary in fig 4c the southwest and eastern sides of the catchment lie the strawberry creek i e the blue boundary in fig 4c and the clear creek i e the green boundary in fig 4c respectively the southern boundary is connected to the dyes inlet i e the yellow boundary in fig 4c in addition some discrete groundwater level data within the catchment i e black triangles in fig 4c was retrieved from the environmental information management system eim of washington state which was used to estimate the initial groundwater levels of the catchment through extrapolation the groundwater levels observed are within 30 m below the land surface and were highest during late spring months and lowest in the late fall and early winter months sceva 1957 one year of monitoring was performed by kitsap county at one urban catchment near the central kitsap county campus ckcc which is located at the central part of the catchment figs 4c and 4d the ckcc site is 2 63 ha in size within which nine bioretention cells and ten parcels of porous pavements are implemented bioretention cells are 35 146 8 m2 in size which allow a surface ponding depth of 100 mm and are consisted of soil and storage layers of 400 mm and 380 mm in thickness respectively the soil layer and the storage layer were filled by amended soil mix and washed aggregated aashto no 57 respectively porous pavements are 238 1710 m2 in size consisting of pavement and storage layers of 50 mm and 750 mm in thickness respectively the pavement layer is made up of eco priora concrete pavers and aashto no 8 aggregate in openings the storage layer is made up of an open graded base and subbase which are filled by aashto no 57 and no 2 aggregates respectively these gi practices are connected to the storm sewer system via 150 mm underdrains the hydrologic properties of different layers of both types of gi practices are shown in table 2 and their detailed designs can be found in herrera 2013 and zhang et al 2018 five datasets are available for one year from 1 october 2011 to 30 september 2012 which include surface runoff from the rooftop of the haselwood family ymca building 0 46 ha r o o f s r surface runoff from one impervious area of 0 068 ha i p s r underdrain flow of one parcel of porous pavement 0 17 ha p p u d the pipe flow at the sewer outlet of the catchment 2 63 ha outlet and the groundwater table depth at one location within the site g w d e p t h all the datasets were continuous and they were at a temporal resolution of 5 min the locations of the monitoring stations are shown in fig 4d and more details about the monitoring approaches and devices can be found in zhang et al 2018 2 3 model settings 2 3 1 swmm given that swmm is a spatially lumped model as mentioned above the catchment is separated into 14 sub catchments or hydrologic response units in swmm fig 4c the hydrologic response units were delineated based on the topography and soil type using arcgis due to the relatively consistent geophysical and hydrologic characteristics within each unit each sub catchment is considered as homogeneous in hydrologic responses the area and the imperviousness of the sub catchments range from 7 67 to 24 23 ha and 47 49 to 100 respectively the detailed properties of the sub catchments can be found in table 1 the dynamic wave model was used for flow routing in the storm sewers and the green ampt equation was used as the infiltration model which allowed the consideration of surface ponding it may slightly overestimate the hydraulic conductivity triadis and broadbridge 2012 but literature also showed that it obtained similar results as that calculated by richards equation for gi practices dussaillant et al 2004 gi practices were placed within sub catchments in a lumped manner instead of being independently represented the detailed hydrologic properties of gi practices can be found in table 2 after implementing gi practices into sub catchments the properties of sub catchments were modified including the imperviousness the width and the percentage of impervious area treated by gi the details of these modifications are elaborated in the below sections when necessary 2 3 2 modflow the grid size in modflow was set as 23 m 23 m considering the trade off between sub catchment size and normal size of gi and between computation accuracy and cost based on the geologic condition there the area was segmented vertically into three subsurface layers in the model the thickness of which were 0 30 m 0 15 m and 0 15 m respectively the properties of the geologic layers and the flow between layers and computational grids were simulated using the layer property flow lpf package the upper two layers were set as convertible in the model because the groundwater table can fluctuate above and below these two layers more specifically the model treats the layer as confined when the groundwater head is above the top computational grids of the layer i e fully saturated and it treats the layer as unconfined when the groundwater head is below the top computational grids of the layer i e partially saturated the model can simulate the watering i e wetting and dewatering i e drying processes of computational grids within these two convertible layers while the bottom layer was set as confined because the groundwater table is always above its top the surface infiltration on the surface retrieved from swmm in each time step was simulated as specified flux into the subsurface layers using the recharge rch package the et was simulated using the evt package and the monthly averaged et rate in the study area was used with an et root depth of 0 5 m the river riv package was used to simulate the river boundaries i e clear creek and strawberry creek which was represented as head dependent flux the river stages of these two rivers retrieved from the kitsap public utility district were simply assigned as the heads of these two boundary conditions assuming the rivers are connected to the unconfined aquifer underneath the assumption was deemed reasonable because the base flow of these two creeks was primarily from groundwater discharge during summer sebren 2017 in addition the general head boundary ghb package was used to simulate the boundary of the sea i e dyes inlet and the sea level retrieved from the noaa tides and currents database was assigned as the head of the boundary condition the boundary of the sea was set to be time dependent because the sea level there showed a diurnal fluctuation of 3 to 4 m which could be significant enough to affect the groundwater dynamics in the study area in addition it should be noted that the coupled swmm modflow ran hourly but swmm and mofwlow ran at a time step of 5 min the preconditioned conjugate gradient pcg package was used to solve the finite difference equations in modflow with a maximum number of iterations of 150 a relaxation parameter of 0 97 and a maximum absolute change in head of 0 01 m 2 4 model calibration and validation although some information about the catchment e g thickness of aquifer soil type distribution are available the exact modeling parameter values may still be unknown it is because some parameters are not directly observable e g drainage coefficient of underdrain manning s n of overland flow and conduit depression storages of impervious and pervious areas and some may vary in significant ranges e g hydraulic conductivity specific yield and specific storage of soils thus the parameters were calibrated first the model was calibrated and validated using the monitoring datasets at ckcc site including r o o f s r i p s r p p u d outlet and g w d e p t h as aforementioned data of the first five months i e from 1 october of 2011 to 29 february of 2012 was used for calibration while that for the last seven months i e from 1 march to 30 september of 2012 was used for validation although both swmm and modflow were run at 5 min time step they were coupled only hourly to save computations in other words swmm and modflow each were run for 12 time steps before each round of data exchange between them updating groundwater table depth or recharge rate in swmm and modflow every hour was considered fine enough to capture the surface runoff and groundwater table dynamics during the one year simulation particularly the general groundwater level in the catchment did not fluctuate at a very fine scale based on historical monitoring herrera 2013 it should be noted that the monitoring data used for model calibration was from the central catchment of the area i e ckcc site the red rectangular area in fig 4c however the model built covered the whole catchment to reach the catchment boundaries as mentioned above the calibration approach was similar to that of zhang et al 2018 more specifically a non dominated sorted genetic algorithm nsga ii algorithm originally developed by seshadri 2009 in matlab was utilized after being integrated with swmm modflow the parallel computing package of matlab was utilized using four cores of the cpus to save computation time the algorithm firstly initialized the parameters for calibration mentioned above then invoked the execution of swmm modflow the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse value of the datasets i e r o o f s r i p s r p p u d outlet and g w d e p t h were then computed as the performance indicators based on the objective of maximizing the performance indicators i e nse values the algorithm generated new populations i e new sets of parameters through processes of parent selection crossover crossover probability 0 9 and mutation mutation probability 0 1 out of the population generated number of population 24 the parameters were improved after iterations of generations the calibration was considered completed when the assigned total generation number of generation 10 was reached the number of generations was considered sufficient because the average nse values of the datasets between the 7th and 8th generations did not differ beyond 5 their near optimums were thus considered reached after the 8th generation the final calibrated parameters were manually selected from the last generation of populations by striking a tradeoff among the nse values of the datasets the swmm parameters to be calibrated include underdrain coefficient underdrain exponent the offset height of underdrain saturated hydraulic conductivity the width of sub catchment manning s n for overland flow the depression storage of impervious area as well as the roughness of conduit besides hydraulic conductivity and specific yield were calibrated in modflow 2 5 the hypothetical case studies a series of hypothetical scenarios was formulated to represent different spatial allocation patterns of bcs then one year continuous simulations were performed using the validated model but with different spatial allocation patterns the simulation duration was considered sufficient to capture the groundwater table dynamics because the response time of shallow groundwater was not as long and the model was warmed up sufficiently the results obtained were also considered representative given that the one year period covers a range of rainfall events and groundwater levels the initial conditions of the above simulations were the results from warm up simulations in which there were no bc more specifically inputted with the precipitation time series from september 2001 to august 2011 of 5 min temporal resolution in the study area the warm up simulations were run repeatedly until reaching a dynamic equilibrium i e when the difference of groundwater levels at ten selected grids from different parts of the catchment between two consecutive simulations was within 0 5 2 5 1 rules of spatial allocation of bioretention cells the rules of allocating bcs within the catchment are illustrated as follows and shown in fig 5 basically bcs are allocated as a cluster of practices within each sub catchment the size of each bc is the same which equals to grid size of modflow i e 23 m 23 m firstly the number of gi within each sub catchment is determined which represents the implementation ratio of bc then the central location of the bc cluster is determined bc4 in fig 5 which represents the approximate location of bc within each sub catchment after that the remaining bcs simply surround the central bc circle by circle following a rectangular shaped pattern until reaching the total number of bcs a certain gap i e 0 69 m in this study is kept between each bc the magnitude of which determines the aggregation level of the bc cluster the physically unavailable locations i e pervious areas and locations out of the sub catchment are skipped during the process yellow cell with a red cross in fig 5 the spatial allocation assumes a uniform allocation pattern within each sub catchment this simplification is considered acceptable because this study focuses more on generating generic understanding instead of making detailed planning in addition the surface flow routing between bcs was neglected which may affect the runoff control performance of bcs however this simplification was considered negligible because this study focused more on groundwater table dynamics and the limited information about the site e g high resolution of topography land use and sewer system also hinders the consideration of flow routing between bcs four dimensionless indicators i e ratio gap loc c and loc sc were used to represent the different aspects of spatial allocation of bcs using equations shown in fig 5 these four indicators were selected because they represent the main factors that need to be considered in gi planning as proposed by zhang and chui 2018b ratio represents the implementation ratio of bcs which is the ratio of the total area of bcs n gi n to the total area of available locations for bcs a n eq 4 gap represents the aggregation level of bcs which is calculated by the ratio of average gap size between bcs l gap and the average size of bcs l bc eq 5 loc c represents the relative location of bcs within the catchment which ranges from 0 to 1 a value closer to 0 or 1 means bcs are mainly allocated in upstream or downstream areas respectively after labeling the sub catchments from 1 to n roughly from upstream to downstream the relative location index of each bc is calculated by dividing the index of sub catchment it belongs to loc n by n then loc c is obtained by taking the average of relative location index of all bcs eq 6 loc sc represents the relative location of bcs within the sub catchments which ranges from 0 to 1 similar to loc c a value closer to 0 or 1 means that bcs are mainly allocated near the upper or lower ends of the sub catchments respectively for a specific sub catchment the available locations for bcs are firstly labeled from 1 to a n roughly from upstream to downstream the relative location index of each bc is calculated by dividing the index of grid it belongs to l o c b c m n by a n then loc sc of this sub catchment is obtained by taking the average of relative location index of all bcs within this sub catchment eq 7 4 ratio n b c n a n 5 gap l gap l bc 6 loc c 1 n 1 n n b c n n 1 n n b c n loc n n 7 loc sc 1 n 1 n n b c n n 1 n m 1 n b c n l o c b c m n a n where n represents the total number of sub catchments 14 in this case n bc n represents the total area of bcs in sub catchment n a n represents the total area of available areas for bcs l bc and l gap represent the size of bcs and the gap in between loc n represents the index of sub catchment n and l o c b c m n represents the index of grid the m th bc in sub catchment n the exact ranges of these four indicators are elaborated in the next section the properties of the bcs e g thickness and hydraulic conductivity of media soils followed those of the bcs at the ckcc site mentioned above more specifically the bc constitutes a 300 mm soil layer and a 380 mm storage layer but differently no underdrain was used for each scenario some sub catchment parameters need to be modified in swmm first the width of sub catchments which is one main parameter used to calculate overland flow in swmm was adjusted by multiplying the original value by a ratio of a n n b c n a n because a proportion of the impervious areas is replaced by bcs this approach had been recommended in swmm manuals and adopted by some swmm users rossman 2015 in addition the percentage of impervious area treated by bcs was also adjusted allowing bcs to receive surface runoff from impervious areas that are 20 times larger at most this is within the recommended range in most design standards i e 5 20 times normally dhalla and zimmer 2010 roseen and stone 2013 woods ballard et al 2015 2 5 2 modeling scenarios and outputs a total of 144 scenario based simulations were performed to evaluate the impact of spatial allocation of bcs on surface runoff and groundwater table dynamics the scenarios covered four different implementation ratios of bcs i e ratio of 0 625 1 25 2 5 and 5 four different aggregation levels i e gap of 0 1 2 and 3 three different locations within the whole catchment i e loc c of around 0 5 0 3 and 0 75 when bcs were allocated distributedly throughout all the sub catchments only in upstream or only in downstream sub catchments respectively and three different locations within sub catchments i e loc sc of around 0 1 0 45 and 0 9 when bcs were allocated near the upper end middle section and lower end of sub catchments respectively the ranges of parameters for the hypothetical scenarios are illustrated in table 3 below the scenario without bcs was also simulated and was treated as the base case then the indicators representing the surface runoff and groundwater table dynamics were calculated by comparing the results of the base case with those of the hypothetical cases more specifically the peak reduction pr and volume reduction vr of surface runoff throughout the year in different sub catchments and for the whole catchment were extracted to represent the surface runoff dynamics the peak gr p and temporally averaged gr m groundwater table rises in different sub catchments and for the whole catchment as well as the standard deviation of groundwater levels in the catchment gl std throughout the year were extracted to represent the groundwater table dynamics the three parameters together can comprehensively represent the local and regional change of groundwater levels as well as the uniformity of groundwater levels it should be noted that in general higher runoff control efficiency i e higher pr and vr and more spatially uniform groundwater levels i e lower gr p gr m and gl std are preferred it is because a more uniform groundwater level is resulted by higher recharge in areas of a deeper groundwater tables and lower recharge in areas of a shallower groundwater tables in areas of deeper groundwater table groundwater normally does not pose concerns for gi and other infrastructures they thus can benefit from higher recharge and the increase in groundwater supply while groundwater mound can more easily form in areas of shallower groundwater tables lower recharge can reduce the potential of groundwater mounding and better maintain the performance of gi and other infrastructures it should be noted that although both surface runoff and groundwater table dynamics were reported the major focus was on groundwater table dynamics 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation fig 6 shows the time series of different datasets during both calibration and validation periods the light grey and dark grey sections in figs 6a 6f correspond to the calibration and validation periods respectively one event on 23 december 2011 is shown specifically in figs 6g 6l this event is considered representative given its medium rainfall intensity i e 12 mm h runoff amount i e 23 mm and groundwater table fluctuation i e 0 3 m during the period which can be observed in fig 6 in addition the final calibrated parameters in both swmm and modflow are shown in table 4 which are all within physically reasonable ranges the pipe flow at the outlet of the catchment outlet and surface runoff of r o o f s r showed very good fits with monitoring data with nse of 0 80 and 0 62 during calibration and 0 64 and 0 51 during validation respectively figs 6d and 6e the underdrain flow of p p u d and surface runoff of i p s r were slightly underestimated at rainfall peaks and rises of groundwater table figs 6h and 6i but were still of reasonable goodness of fit the nse of p p u d and i p s r were 0 44 and 0 42 during calibration and 0 50 and 0 41 during validation respectively particularly the goodness of fit of p p u d was even better during the selected event with nse of 0 72 fig 6h generally the goodness of fit of these datasets i e r o o f s r i p s r outlet and p p u d were acceptable ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 which was comparable to that obtained by zhang et al 2018 using swmm lid gw with groundwater monitoring data as direct input comparatively the goodness of fit for g w d e p t h was not as satisfactory with nse of 0 26 and 0 33 during calibration and validation periods respectively fig 6f however the swmm modflow captured the general fluctuations of groundwater table during the period figs 6f and 6l and the goodness of fit during the selected event was reasonably good nse of 0 61 fig 6l the good fits of p p u d and outlet also confirmed the accuracy of groundwater simulation to some extent because they were both highly related to groundwater table depth as shown in zhang et al 2018 the discrepancy could be reduced if there could be more and longer monitoring data for model calibration and if a better understanding about the spatial variation of subsurface geophysical conditions in the study area e g hydraulic conductivity and specific yield could be obtained 3 2 surface runoff dynamics fig 7 shows the surface runoff response represented by peak reduction pr and volume reduction vr of surface runoff at different sub catchments for different implementation ratios of bcs it should be noted that the values shown in the graph fig 7 are the averaged results of other different scenarios in other words fig 7 explicitly shows the results for different ratio and the values in the graph are the averaged results for different gap loc c and loc sc this also applies to other similar graphs i e figs 8 13 as expected pr and vr were greater when there were more bcs more specifically pr and vr for the whole area shown as dashed lines in figs 7b and 7e increased from 1 9 1 3 to 8 6 2 7 22 3 2 8 and 43 6 4 8 and from 4 2 1 7 to 15 1 2 7 35 2 3 1 and 54 5 13 5 when the implementation ratio of bcs increased from 0 625 to 1 25 2 50 and 5 00 respectively considering that this is a highly impermeable catchment around 80 urbanized the impact of bcs may not be as significant for other more permeable catchments furthermore it was found that the impact of implementation ratio was different in different sub catchments using the scenario of implementation ratio of 5 00 as an example pr of s7 s8 and s9 were 56 7 41 2 53 9 40 6 and 52 2 39 9 which were significantly higher than that of s1 s4 s10 and s14 which were around 0 0 0 0 30 4 26 2 43 3 37 0 and 32 9 30 7 fig 7b it was the same case for vr fig 7e the difference was probably caused by differences of imperviousness slope permeability of in situ soils and groundwater table depth in different sub catchments compared to s7 s8 and s9 i e 57 50 7 and 66 2 the imperviousness of s4 s10 and s14 were higher i e 79 1 95 3 and 78 7 and the soils of s4 s10 and s14 i e near the two rivers and the sea are of lower permeability which resulted in lower runoff control efficiency in these areas although sub catchment s1 was lower in imperviousness i e 47 5 the pr and vr there were relatively because of its relatively steeper topography i e average surface slope of 14 than that of other sub catchments which was not beneficial for runoff control in addition groundwater table depth was also found to be influential because the variation of mean groundwater table depth throughout the year in different sub catchments fig 8b showed a similar pattern as that of pr and vr as shown in figs 7b and 7e more specifically among upstream sub catchments i e s1 s6 s2 had a comparatively deeper groundwater table which resulted in a higher runoff control efficiency and among downstream sub catchments i e s7 s14 s9 s10 s12 and s14 had comparatively shallower groundwater tables which resulted in lower runoff control efficiency in these sub catchments this demonstrated the hypothesis of interaction between bc and groundwater in this study and was overall consistent with the mechanism of bc and runoff generation that found in some other existing literature shuster et al 2005 dietz and clausen 2008 ahiablame and shakya 2016 3 3 groundwater table dynamics figs 9 13 compare the response of groundwater table to bcs of different spatial allocations more specifically figs 9 11 12 and 13 show the spatial variation of peak gr p and temporally averaged gr m groundwater table rises within the catchment and fig 10 illustrates the standard deviation of groundwater levels in the catchment gl std throughout the year 3 3 1 impact of the implementation ratio of bioretention cells a small number of bcs can already significantly change the groundwater dynamics for example when averaged over the whole catchment if 0 625 1 25 2 50 and 5 00 of the impervious area was replaced by bcs the peak groundwater rise gr p can be around 0 13 0 05 m 0 34 0 08 m 0 82 0 11 m and 1 31 0 38 m respectively i e dashed lines in figs 9b and 9c at some specific locations the groundwater table rise can be few meters or even higher 5 m during some specific time fig 9d this was a significant change and can be problematic considering the thickness of the unsaturated zone was only from 0 to 5 m in around half of the catchment and 5 out of 14 sub catchments had groundwater table really close to the ground fig 8b in addition it was found that bc not only affects the local groundwater table but also influences the regional groundwater levels when 5 of the catchment was replaced by bcs the groundwater table of the catchment can be 1 m closer to the ground compared with an implementation ratio of 0 625 fig 8c this can be also seen from the significant large area of groundwater table rise i e darker green regions shown in figs 9a and 9e a similar observation was obtained by bhaskar et al 2018 thus it illustrated the importance of considering groundwater table condition in the spatial planning of gi figs 9d and 9h illustrate the exceedance probability curves of gr p and gr m within the catchment which show the proportion of catchment area with different levels of gr p and gr m similarly figs 11d 11 h 12d 12h 13d and 13h illustrate the same information they provide another perspective on the groundwater table dynamics as a result of bcs with more bcs implemented the proportion of catchment area with lower groundwater rises e g 1 0 m for peak rise and 0 4 m for temporally averaged rise was lower while that of higher groundwater rise e g 1 0 m for peak rise and 0 4 m for temporally averaged rise was higher figs 9d and 9h for example if only 0 625 of the impervious area was replaced by bcs around 100 of the catchment had gr p less than 1 0 m and gr m less than 0 2 m however if 5 00 of the catchment was replaced by bcs only 48 and 39 of the catchment had gr p and gr m less than 1 0 m and 0 2 m respectively around 33 14 4 and 2 of the catchment had gr p of 1 2 m 2 3 m 3 4 m and 4 5 m respectively figs 9d and 9h similar to surface runoff the groundwater table response also varied among different sub catchments comparatively sub catchments around the center of the catchment e g s3 and s9 showed higher groundwater table rises than those closer to the catchment boundary e g s1 and s14 figs 9b and 9f a similar observation can be obtained in figs 11 13 this was because the upstream areas were of steeper topography and groundwater hydraulic gradients while the downstream areas were of gentler topography and groundwater hydraulic gradients as a result the groundwater tended to gather in the central sub catchments e g s3 and s9 than sub catchments nearer the boundary this was a quite common phenomenon in sloped areas focusing on a catchment of a similar terrain i e steeper and gentler in upstream and downstream respectively in china cai et al 2016 also found that the groundwater level was higher in the medium section of the catchment the same phenomenon however may not occur in catchments of different topographies for example a more uniform groundwater table rise is expected in relatively flat catchments furthermore as illustrated in fig 10a increasing the implementation level of bcs can slightly decrease the average uniformity of groundwater table due to the greater maximum and minimum gl std values however the differences were not that significant during around 50 of the time the uniformity of groundwater table condition among different implementation ratios was very similar fig 10a thus implementing more bcs with an appropriate allocation strategy may not be unfavorable to the regional groundwater dynamics 3 3 2 impact of the aggregation level of bioretention cells fig 11 compares the response of groundwater table to bcs of different aggregation levels the spatial variation of groundwater table rises was different for different aggregation levels particularly for gr p fig 11a when bcs were more aggregated i e smaller gap the groundwater table rises were also more concentrated fig 11a as a result bcs allocated in a more aggregated pattern formed slightly higher gr p for the overall catchment i e dashed lines in figs 11b and 11c gr p of the catchment was 0 70 0 55 m 0 66 0 51 m 0 65 0 50 m and 0 64 0 48 m when gap was 0 1 2 and 3 respectively it was as expected because more aggregated bcs with a relatively short distance in between may form overlapped groundwater mound endreny and collins 2009 when bcs were more aggregated the proportion of lower gr p areas was smaller while that of higher g r p was greater fig 11d for the same reason gl std of the catchment was slightly higher when bcs were allocated in a more aggregated pattern fig 10b however gr m for the catchment was slightly greater when bcs were allocated in a more distributed pattern fig 11f when bcs were more distributed the proportion of lower gr m areas was smaller while that of higher gr m was greater fig 11h which was different from that of gr p as shown in fig 11d this was possibly because more distributed bcs can affect a greater proportion of area this can be seen from the spatial variation of gr m of the catchment in which the shaded areas were larger when gap was greater fig 11e as a result the overall groundwater table rise of the catchment could be higher although given a relatively lower local groundwater table rise at specific locations however the impact of aggregation level on the regional groundwater table dynamics was relatively minimal compared to that of implementation level this can be seen from the minimal difference of groundwater table depth shown in fig 8d thus to achieve a more spatially uniform groundwater level which is a generally desired condition bcs with more distributed patterns are preferred when groundwater table depth is relatively uniform while when bcs need to be allocated in a more aggregated pattern e g due to site constraints it would be better if they can be allocated in places of a deeper groundwater table 3 3 3 impact of the location of bioretention cells figs 12 and 13 compare the response of groundwater table to bcs allocated at different locations within the catchment and within sub catchments respectively when bcs were spatially distributedly or in upstream areas of the catchment gr p and gr m were greater than those with bcs in downstream areas when bcs were spatially distributed only in upstream areas and only in downstream areas the corresponding gr p for the whole catchment was 0 72 0 66 m 0 70 0 47 m and 0 54 0 33 m i e dashed lines in figs 12b and 12c and the gr m was 0 45 m 0 46 m and 0 31 m respectively i e dashed lines in figs 12f and 12g in addition the proportion of lower groundwater table rise areas i e both gr p and gr m was smaller and that of higher groundwater table rise areas was greater when bcs were spatially distributed and only in upstream areas figs 12d and 12h these phenomena are likely due to two possible reasons first as shown in fig 9 the groundwater table in upstream areas i e s1 s3 s4 s5 and s6 was closer to the ground surface so the groundwater table may respond and rise more quickly and more significantly second it may be resulted by the existence of the regional groundwater hydraulic gradient generally the recharge from bcs in upstream areas can affect the groundwater table conditions in downstream areas more quickly and to a larger spatial extent while recharge in downstream areas normally extends to the surroundings without an obvious direction this can be seen clearly from figs 11b and 11f when bcs were allocated in upstream sub catchments s1 s7 obvious groundwater table rise was observed in some downstream sub catchments s8 s10 while when bcs were allocated in downstream sub catchments s8 s14 the groundwater table also rose at some of the upstream sub catchments i e s2 s3 and s7 but was relatively minimal however the magnitude of this effect may differ for different regional groundwater hydraulic gradients and hydrologic connectivity jones et al 2019 for example the effect may not be as significant for areas of relatively flat topographies a similar phenomenon was observed through comparing the gr m for bcs allocated at different locations within sub catchments fig 13 compared with bcs at the lower end of the sub catchments i e 0 31 0 22 m gr m for the overall catchment was greater when bcs were at the upper end or in the middle section of the sub catchments i e 0 44 0 32 m and 0 46 0 36 m respectively figs 13f and 13g it is because the proportion of higher gr m areas was greater when bcs were allocated at the upper end or middle section of the sub catchments fig 13h in addition the groundwater levels within the catchment was less uniform represented by larger gl std when bcs were allocated in upstream areas and near upper end of sub catchments and vice versa figs 10c and 10d thus when groundwater table is relatively deep bcs generally should be better allocated in upstream areas to result in greater regional groundwater recharge and groundwater table rise while when groundwater table is relatively shallow it is generally better to allocate bcs in the downstream areas to minimize groundwater table rise and the potential influence on the performance of bc however the optimal allocation may vary case by case as some other geophysical conditions should also be considered e g soil distribution furthermore it was found that both gr p and gr m of upstream sub catchments s1 s7 were greater when bcs were allocated at the upper end of the sub catchments while those of downstream sub catchments s9 s14 were greater when bcs were allocated at the lower end of the sub catchments figs 13b and 13f for example when bcs were located at the upper end middle section and lower end gr p of s2 decreased from around 1 01 0 86 m to 0 68 0 61 m and 0 51 0 61 m respectively figs 13b and 13c and gr m of s2 decreased from 0 67 0 62 m to 0 47 0 43 m and 0 30 0 38 m respectively figs 13f and 13g while gr p of s9 increased from 0 72 0 65 m to 1 03 0 93 m and 1 38 1 23 m respectively figs 13b and 13c and gr m of s9 increased from 0 43 0 39 m to 0 54 0 42 m and 0 61 0 46 m respectively figs 13f and 13g this was because the extent of groundwater rise was greater near bcs machusick et al 2011 thomas and vogel 2011 nemirovsky et al 2014 more specifically when bcs in all sub catchments were allocated at the upper end of each sub catchment bcs within the downstream sub catchments were relatively closer to the upstream sub catchments therefore the groundwater recharge by bcs in downstream sub catchments can more easily affect upstream sub catchments resulting in higher groundwater table rise in upstream areas oppositely when bcs were allocated at the lower end of each sub catchment bcs within the upstream sub catchments were relatively closer to the downstream sub catchments then the groundwater recharge by bcs in upstream sub catchments can more easily affect downstream sub catchments resulting in higher groundwater table rise in downstream areas 3 4 relationships between surface runoff and groundwater table dynamics fig 14 illustrates the inter correlations between the responses of surface runoff and groundwater table to bcs of different implementation ratios each dot in the graph represents the data i e either pr vr gr p gr m or gl std for one sub catchment one observation can be obtained from the bar plots along the diagonal of fig 14 more specifically when there was more bcs i e ratio of 5 00 versus others the occurrences of higher pr vr gr p gr m and gl std were greater which was consistent with that observed in pervious sections as expected pr and vr correlated with each other closely with an r 2 of 0 95 while for groundwater table rises only gr p and gr m were closely correlated r 2 of 0 91 gl std was less correlated to the other two indicators r 2 of 0 59 and 0 42 for gr p and gr m respectively in addition the indicators of surface runoff i e pr and vr were also correlated with the indicators of groundwater table rises i e gr p gr m and gl std at a relatively lower but still significant level fig 14 more specifically pr correlated with gr p gr m and gl std with r 2 of 0 85 0 82 and 0 45 respectively and vr correlated with gr p gr m and gl std with r 2 of 0 86 0 84 and 0 45 respectively the observed correlation was not surprising since the reduction of surface runoff and the increase of groundwater recharge were simultaneous outcomes of enhanced infiltration and recharge of gi these observations altogether again reflected the importance of considering the tradeoff between surface runoff control and groundwater protection in gi planning a more ideal gi strategy should reduce surface runoff but also maintain a relatively minimal influence on groundwater dynamics in addition it also demonstrated that an integrated hydrologic model with capacity to characterize the interaction between gi and groundwater is essential for gi planning 4 concluding remarks a coupled surface subsurface hydrological model swmm modflow was developed to evaluate the surface runoff and groundwater table dynamics of green infrastructure of different spatial allocations at catchment scale the model was calibrated and validated using the monitoring data at one urban catchment at kitsap county washington state of the united states using bioretention cells as the representative green infrastructure a series of hypothetical simulations was performed the influence of spatial allocation of bioretention cells represented by the implementation ratio aggregation level and location on surface runoff and groundwater table dynamics was quantified the primary findings are summarized as follows the implementation ratio of bioretention cells was the main spatial feature that governed both surface runoff and groundwater table dynamics with higher implementation ratios the peak reduction and volume reduction of surface runoff were greater and the peak and temporally averaged groundwater table rises were higher however implementing more bioretention cells with an appropriate allocation strategy may not affect the uniformity of regional groundwater levels represented as the standard deviation of regional groundwater levels bioretention cells of more distributedly allocated patterns resulted in slightly lower peak groundwater table rise higher temporally averaged groundwater table rise and lower standard deviation of groundwater levels in the catchment thus if a more uniform groundwater level is desired bioretention cells should be allocated in a more distributed pattern generally while they are recommended to can be allocated in places of deeper groundwater tables when bioretention cells need to be allocated in a more aggregated pattern e g due to site constraints the impact of aggregation level of bioretention cells was relatively low compared to the implementation ratio and relative location of bioretention cells in the catchment allocating bioretention cells upstream resulted in higher groundwater table rises regionally due to the regional groundwater hydraulic gradient thus bioretention cells are recommended to be allocated more upstream in the catchment when the groundwater table is relatively deep to produce a greater regional groundwater recharge and groundwater table rise while they are recommended to be allocated more downstream in the catchment when groundwater table is relatively shallow to minimize groundwater table rise and the potential influence on the performance of bioretention cells in addition the geophysical conditions of and their spatial variations within the catchment should be considered when allocating bioretention cells bioretention cells of greater surface runoff control efficiencies led to higher groundwater table rises thus it is of great importance to consider the tradeoff between surface runoff control and groundwater protection in the planning of green infrastructure and an integrated hydrologic model that can characterize the interaction between green infrastructures and groundwater is essential this study carries certain limitations first the coupled model considered the impact of shallow groundwater on some hydrological processes e g exfiltration underdrain flow and surface runoff but some other processes were neglected for example the impact of shallow groundwater on evapotranspiration of gi was not considered which could be influential in some conditions such as areas of shallow groundwater or arid climate second the rule in allocating bioretention cells spatially in the hypothetical simulations is simplified the detailed land uses e g buildings roads and physical constraints e g underground infrastructures were not considered due to the unavailability of relevant information and a relatively uniform allocation pattern was assumed as a result the main insights obtained in this study may have limited contribution at the scales of single gi practices but they can be beneficial to a higher level planning of gi the simplified rule of spatial allocation of gi practices therefore should not affect the insights which target at regional scales in fact considering the specific physical and or legal constraints of the study area may even affect the transferability of the insights because the constraints can be very different in different areas third the simulations in this study only considered the boundary conditions and hydrogeological conditions of one catchment due to data availability however the results from this study can serve as a general reference for others and the developed model and study methodology can be applied to other catchments to obtain more specific and accurate findings future studies can examine more catchment characteristics e g through the use of more hypothetical catchments and more spatial allocation rules of green infrastructure they can also explore the optimal spatial

5513,well designed and implemented green infrastructure gi can help to recover the natural hydrologic regime of urban areas a large scale gi planning requires a good understanding of the impact of gi spatial allocation on surface subsurface hydrologic dynamics this study firstly developed a coupled surface subsurface hydrological model swmm modflow that can simulate fine temporal scale two way interactions between gi and groundwater at catchment scale the model was calibrated and validated using the monitoring data at one urban catchment within kitsap county wa us based on the validated model a series of hypothetical simulations was then performed to evaluate how spatial allocation of bioretention cells bcs one type of gi influences and correlates with surface runoff and groundwater table dynamics the spatial allocation was represented by implementation ratio i e area aggregation level i e density and location of bcs the hydrologic dynamics were quantified by peak and volume reductions of surface runoff as well as groundwater table rise and standard deviation of groundwater levels a small number of bcs can raise groundwater table locally and regionally however it may not affect the spatial uniformity of groundwater levels represented as the standard deviation of groundwater levels if being properly allocated although the impact of aggregation level of bcs was relatively low compared to the implementation ratio and relative location of bcs more distributed bcs resulted in lower peak groundwater table rises but higher temporally averaged groundwater table rises allocating bcs upstream resulted in higher groundwater table rises regionally which is recommended for areas of deeper groundwater tables while allocating bcs downstream is more recommended for areas of shallower groundwater tables bcs of greater surface runoff control efficiencies lead to higher groundwater table rises which highlights the importance of considering the tradeoff between surface runoff control and groundwater protection in gi planning keywords low impact development bioretention cell stormwater management integrated modeling groundwater modeling urban planning 1 introduction excessive urbanization has significantly deteriorated the natural hydrological ecological and biological regimes there is now a general consensus that a more sustainable and environmental friendly development approach is needed song 2005 green infrastructure gi is therefore proposed under this cognitive revolution brown et al 2009 however different people may define gi differently for people concerned about hydrology and stormwater management e g hydrologists urban drainage engineers gi is analogous to some other terms e g low impact development lid sustainable urban drainage system suds and water sensitive urban design wsud which represent a group of semi natural spatially distributed stormwater management practices potter 2006 young et al 2014 fletcher et al 2015 compared to traditional drainage systems they possess more diverse functionalities which include collecting storing infiltrating rainfall runoff and recovering natural hydrological cycle chui et al 2016 representative practices include bioretention cells porous pavements green roofs etc while for other people e g landscape designers urban planners gi can include forests or other green spaces that could be better in providing other environmental benefits such as urban heat island mitigation and biodiversity increase ec 2013 zhang and chui 2019 the gi in this study follows the first definition having a main focus on hydrology and stormwater management among all the benefits that gi can provide e g peak runoff and non point source pollution control groundwater recharge is the one that attracts relatively little attention jefferson et al 2017 sohn et al 2019 one possible reason is that recharging groundwater using gi normally comes with many challenges which are prominent in shallow groundwater areas particularly first a groundwater mound can form when the recharge rate exceeds the dissipation rate of groundwater this may slow down or inhibit surface infiltration and increase the risk of groundwater contamination due to a shorter traveling distance and more carried pollutants fischer et al 2003 datry et al 2004 göbel et al 2004 endreny and collins 2009 machusick et al 2011 stewart et al 2017 zhang and chui 2017 zhang and chui 2018a however recharging groundwater using gi can increase the baseflow recover the hydrological cycle and help maintain urban water supplies newcomer et al 2014 bhaskar et al 2016 2018 bradshaw and luthy 2017 it should therefore be promoted if given appropriate conditions e g suitable subsurface soil properties and relatively deep groundwater table trinh and chui 2013 chui and trinh 2016 for the reasons aforementioned the objectives and constraints related to groundwater recharge should be thoroughly considered in gi planning however maximizing the control in surface runoff often remains the dominant objective in gi implementation as reviewed by zhang and chui 2018b many studies considered peak and volume control of surface runoff e g perez pedini et al 2005 damodaram and zechman 2012 sebti et al 2016 giacomoni and joseph 2017 lim and welty 2017 voter and loheide 2018 while many others considered pollution mitigation of surface runoff e g maringanti et al 2009 rodriguez et al 2011 chiang et al 2014 chen et al 2015 2016 and some examined the two aspects together lee et al 2012 liu et al 2016a 2016b mao et al 2017 xu et al 2018 regarding works relating gi and groundwater some studies assessed the response of shallow groundwater to gi endreny and collins 2009 trinh and chui 2013 chui and trinh 2016 zheng et al 2018 also some proposed recommendations about the suitable distance between gi and groundwater table locatelli et al 2015 zhang and chui 2017 muñoz carpena et al 2018 lauvernet and muñoz carpena 2018 however to the best of the authors knowledge the impact of gi spatial allocation on shallow groundwater table dynamics remains to be evaluated the spatial allocation of gi is hypothesized to affect the groundwater table dynamics in a number of aspects based on the study of zhang and chui 2018b the spatial allocation of gi can be mainly represented by implementation ratio i e the area aggregation level i e density and location of gi practices first the implementation ratio of gi is one of the major factors because it determines the amount of rainfall that can be infiltrated with a higher implementation ratio more water can be recharged and the groundwater table should rise higher second the aggregation level of gi is also influential because more aggregated gi practices can infiltrate more water locally and result in localized groundwater mound as reported by endreny and collins 2009 third the location of gi also matters as the land use and geologic conditions e g hydraulic properties of in situ soil groundwater table depth can be very different at different locations more specifically in areas of higher imperviousness more permeable soils and shallower groundwater tables gi can affect the groundwater table dynamics more due to more surface runoff generated higher infiltration and recharge rate vice versa the concept of variable source area well explains the impacts of these factors miles and band 2015 lim 2016 some studies determined the spatial allocation of gi only based on these land use and geologic factors by using spatial analysis tools without hydrological analysis martin mikle et al 2015 johnson and sample 2017 although there are many different numerical models that can simulate the hydrological processes of gi they all have their limitations in simulating gi in shallow groundwater environment as reviewed by zhang et al 2018 variably saturated porous media software e g comsol multiphysics vs2d hydrus 1d 2d 3d have been used in some cases he and davis 2010 stewart et al 2017 zhang and chui 2017 however they generally cannot handle or are not suitable for catchment scale studies because they simplify or cannot simulate rainfall runoff generation and surface runoff routing in addition some surface subsurface hydrological models e g modhms mike she and velma can better simulate rainfall runoff processes and are more widely used at the catchment scale barron et al 2013 trinh and chui 2013 locatelli et al 2017 hoghooghi et al 2018 however they mostly operate in relatively coarse temporal and spatial resolutions which are beyond the normal scale of each individual gi practice thus some time and space sensitive hydrological processes important to gi are simplified finally many of them are commercial and non open source software which make them harder to be improved or integrated with other tools e g data analysis and optimization tools and both types of models cannot simulate urban hydraulics e g storm sewer systems which limit their usages in urban areas as an urban hydrologic hydraulic model swmm has been widely adopted to simulate gi including assessing the hydrological and water quality treatment performance of gi qin et al 2013 palla and gnecco 2015 chui et al 2016 jayasooriya et al 2016 avellaneda et al 2017 kong et al 2017 as well as evaluating the optimal designs and allocations of gi elliott et al 2009 lucas and sample 2015 giacomoni and joseph 2017 macro et al 2019 yang and chui 2018a b zischg et al 2018 however swmm is not as capable in simulating the subsurface hydrological performance of gi first it highly simplifies the simulation of unsaturated and saturated flows by assuming a linearized soil water retention curve second it neglects the impact of groundwater on the hydrological processes of gi e g exfiltration percolation underdrain flow lee et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 to partially overcome these deficiencies zhang et al 2018 had improved swmm by creating an interface to incorporate groundwater levels into the simulation of gi and it had been tested that the modified swmm is appropriate for simulating the performance of gi in shallow groundwater environments however it cannot simulate groundwater dynamics but requires the direct input of groundwater levels which greatly hinders its application as a follow up study of zhang et al 2018 this study integrated the modified swmm named swmm lid gw with modflow to develop a loosely coupled surface subsurface hydrological model swmm modflow it is loosely coupled because the structures of two models were kept unchanged and the two models were integrated through external file input output without internal function calls the coupling approach utilized in this study is similar to that of zhang et al 2018 however the groundwater dynamics were simulated instead of being inputted and the two way interaction between gi and groundwater was realized the model was calibrated and validated using the monitoring data in one urban catchment at silverdale washington state of the united states then using bioretention cell bc that allows exfiltration as a representative gi a series of hypothetical scenarios of different spatial allocation patterns of bcs was simulated which covered different implementation ratios aggregation levels and locations of bcs within the same catchment furthermore the influence of spatial allocation of bcs on surface runoff and groundwater table dynamics was evaluated finally the correlations between surface runoff and groundwater table dynamics were examined it should be noted that this study focused more on groundwater rather than surface runoff dynamics because they were less studied and understood 2 methodology 2 1 modeling framework of swmm modflow a two way coupled surface subsurface hydrological model swmm modflow was developed and utilized it is a loosely coupled model linking swmm and modflow and its structure is shown in fig 1 retaining the main structures of swmm and modflow the coupling was performed through file input and output without internal function calls between the source codes of two models more specifically surface infiltration rate in non gi pervious areas or exfiltration rate at the bottom of gi is sent from swmm to modflow while groundwater table depth is sent from modflow to swmm fig 1 based on the groundwater table depth obtained from modflow the hydrological processes of gi i e underdrain flow exfiltration rate and surface runoff are calculated using the equations of swmm lid gw developed by zhang et al 2018 eqs 1 and 2 furthermore modflow can also simulate groundwater table dynamics after receiving the infiltration and exfiltration rates from swmm the governing equation of groundwater flow in modflow is shown in eq 3 below 1 f drain a h ws h offset b i f h ws h gw a h gw h offset b i f h ws h gw where f drain means the rate of underdrain flow a and b are the two coefficients of underdrain which depend on the size and density of holes on the underdrain respectively h offset is the distance between the underdrain and the bottom of gi h ws is the depth of water storage within the gi and h gw is the distance between the groundwater table and the bottom of gi 2 f exfil θ s θ θ s θ i k s where f exfil means the exfiltration rate k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the in situ soils θ s and θ i are the saturated and initial moisture contents of in situ soils θ is the current moisture content of in situ soil near the bottom of gi which depends on groundwater table depth basically the exfiltration rate varies with the groundwater table depth and soil moisture of in situ soils it equals to k s when the soil moisture of in situ soils equals to θ i when there is no groundwater mound and reduces to zero when the soil gets saturated when groundwater table rises to or above the bottom of gi the initial moisture content of in situ soils θ i is updated every time step based on the groundwater table depth nearby gi some of the variables mentioned above are illustrated in fig 2 it should be noted that this equation characterizes groundwater mounding in a simplified manner which thus has some limitations first it is more appropriate for event based simulations due to the inclusion of θ i it however has been demonstrated to be suitable for long term simulations locatelli et al 2015 in addition due to the inclusion of θ i the equation may slightly overestimate the exfiltration rate because the exfiltration rate can be close to k s even when groundwater table is shallow 3 x k x h x y k y h y z k z h z s s h t where k x k y k z represent the hydraulic conductivity in x y and z directions s s represents the specific storage and h represents the average groundwater head of grids beneath gi which is used to calculate the soil moisture at the bottom of gi i e θ in eq 2 through the van genuchten equation overall the coupled model can characterize the variations of hydrological processes of gi with groundwater table depth when groundwater table fluctuates the underdrain flow and exfiltration rate can vary as characterized by the equations above as a result the percolation rate from soil layer to storage layer the surface infiltration rate and the rate of surface runoff may also vary according to the water balance inside the different layers of gi for example when groundwater table is shallower than the bottom of gi and also the underdrain the exfiltration stops and the underdrain flow is governed by groundwater table instead of percolation rate thus the maximum percolation rate and surface infiltration rate should be equal to the rate of underdrain flow more details about these settings can be found in zhang et al 2018 the data exchange mentioned above is governed by a matlab controller the detailed mechanisms of the matlab controller and the data exchange are also shown in fig 1 the controller firstly realizes temporal synchronization between two models using the hot start functions which allow the two models to pause and re start from previous time step when necessary more specifically one simulation is segmented into multiple time steps after the completion of each time step one model was paused with results of this time step stored into external hot start files and also sent to the controller for processing then the other model is activated by the controller after receiving the processed results from the hot start files fig 1 note that the hot start files are normally used to define the initial conditions of a new simulation however in this study the hot start files were used to store the results of every time step and enable external data transfer between the two models the hot start function in swmm had already been improved by zhang et al 2018 which supported the storage and extraction of gi simulation results including soil moisture of the soil zone water depth at the surface and water depth inside the storage layer into the external hot start files fig 1 however there is no similar built in function in the current modflow thus a hot start function was developed in modflow by transferring and modifying the source code from gsflow which is another surface subsurface hydrological model coupled by precipitation runoff modeling system prms and modflow regan et al 2015 with similar functionality as that of swmm the hot start function of modflow can store and extract groundwater heads and percolation rates in different layers of grids at the end and start of each time step details about this hot start function in swmm and modflow can be found in zhang et al 2018 and regan et al 2015 respectively the controller performs the spatial mapping between two models by processing the results from each model into organized and transferable formats this is necessary because the spatial representation approaches of the two models are completely different swmm is a sub catchment based spatially lumped model but modflow is a grid based finite difference model as shown in fig 3 the spatial mapping works as follows on one hand the controller extracts infiltration rate of pervious areas or exfiltration rate of gi from the output files of swmm then discretizes them into matrixes and updates the input files of modflow figs 1 and 3 on the other hand the controller extracts matrixes of groundwater heads from the output files of modflow modifies them into groundwater table depths then lumps into sub catchment based values and updates the input files of swmm figs 1 and 3 although the location of gi within sub catchments cannot be specified in swmm they can be accurately located in modflow yellow rectangles in fig 3 through three indicators i e index of sub catchment index of gi within each sub catchment and coordinates of grids of gi this mapping process is schematically illustrated in fig 3 2 2 study area and data an urban catchment in the silverdale kitsap county washington state of the united states was selected as the study area fig 4 the study area is 197 ha total in size with around 80 urbanized which is located on the kitsap peninsula figs 4a and 4b lying at the northern tip of the dyes inlet connected to the puget sound the area is of equable oceanic climate with generally mild temperatures and moderate to heavy precipitation sceva 1957 it has warm dry summers and relatively mild winters the precipitation was averaged at 1103 6 mm year with 161 precipitation days and the reference evapotranspiration et was around 741 7 mm year during 1991 2018 the catchment was located at one pleistocene depositional unit of kitsap county the major soil types of the area include but are not limited to bedrock advanced outwash gravels lacustrine peat and till based on local geologic survey sceva 1957 and the ssurgo soil database nrcs and usda 2017 the northern and western parts of the catchment are mountainous with an average slope of 10 14 so the highest locations were assigned as the domain boundaries in these two directions which were assumed as no flow boundaries in the groundwater model i e the light grey boundary in fig 4c the southwest and eastern sides of the catchment lie the strawberry creek i e the blue boundary in fig 4c and the clear creek i e the green boundary in fig 4c respectively the southern boundary is connected to the dyes inlet i e the yellow boundary in fig 4c in addition some discrete groundwater level data within the catchment i e black triangles in fig 4c was retrieved from the environmental information management system eim of washington state which was used to estimate the initial groundwater levels of the catchment through extrapolation the groundwater levels observed are within 30 m below the land surface and were highest during late spring months and lowest in the late fall and early winter months sceva 1957 one year of monitoring was performed by kitsap county at one urban catchment near the central kitsap county campus ckcc which is located at the central part of the catchment figs 4c and 4d the ckcc site is 2 63 ha in size within which nine bioretention cells and ten parcels of porous pavements are implemented bioretention cells are 35 146 8 m2 in size which allow a surface ponding depth of 100 mm and are consisted of soil and storage layers of 400 mm and 380 mm in thickness respectively the soil layer and the storage layer were filled by amended soil mix and washed aggregated aashto no 57 respectively porous pavements are 238 1710 m2 in size consisting of pavement and storage layers of 50 mm and 750 mm in thickness respectively the pavement layer is made up of eco priora concrete pavers and aashto no 8 aggregate in openings the storage layer is made up of an open graded base and subbase which are filled by aashto no 57 and no 2 aggregates respectively these gi practices are connected to the storm sewer system via 150 mm underdrains the hydrologic properties of different layers of both types of gi practices are shown in table 2 and their detailed designs can be found in herrera 2013 and zhang et al 2018 five datasets are available for one year from 1 october 2011 to 30 september 2012 which include surface runoff from the rooftop of the haselwood family ymca building 0 46 ha r o o f s r surface runoff from one impervious area of 0 068 ha i p s r underdrain flow of one parcel of porous pavement 0 17 ha p p u d the pipe flow at the sewer outlet of the catchment 2 63 ha outlet and the groundwater table depth at one location within the site g w d e p t h all the datasets were continuous and they were at a temporal resolution of 5 min the locations of the monitoring stations are shown in fig 4d and more details about the monitoring approaches and devices can be found in zhang et al 2018 2 3 model settings 2 3 1 swmm given that swmm is a spatially lumped model as mentioned above the catchment is separated into 14 sub catchments or hydrologic response units in swmm fig 4c the hydrologic response units were delineated based on the topography and soil type using arcgis due to the relatively consistent geophysical and hydrologic characteristics within each unit each sub catchment is considered as homogeneous in hydrologic responses the area and the imperviousness of the sub catchments range from 7 67 to 24 23 ha and 47 49 to 100 respectively the detailed properties of the sub catchments can be found in table 1 the dynamic wave model was used for flow routing in the storm sewers and the green ampt equation was used as the infiltration model which allowed the consideration of surface ponding it may slightly overestimate the hydraulic conductivity triadis and broadbridge 2012 but literature also showed that it obtained similar results as that calculated by richards equation for gi practices dussaillant et al 2004 gi practices were placed within sub catchments in a lumped manner instead of being independently represented the detailed hydrologic properties of gi practices can be found in table 2 after implementing gi practices into sub catchments the properties of sub catchments were modified including the imperviousness the width and the percentage of impervious area treated by gi the details of these modifications are elaborated in the below sections when necessary 2 3 2 modflow the grid size in modflow was set as 23 m 23 m considering the trade off between sub catchment size and normal size of gi and between computation accuracy and cost based on the geologic condition there the area was segmented vertically into three subsurface layers in the model the thickness of which were 0 30 m 0 15 m and 0 15 m respectively the properties of the geologic layers and the flow between layers and computational grids were simulated using the layer property flow lpf package the upper two layers were set as convertible in the model because the groundwater table can fluctuate above and below these two layers more specifically the model treats the layer as confined when the groundwater head is above the top computational grids of the layer i e fully saturated and it treats the layer as unconfined when the groundwater head is below the top computational grids of the layer i e partially saturated the model can simulate the watering i e wetting and dewatering i e drying processes of computational grids within these two convertible layers while the bottom layer was set as confined because the groundwater table is always above its top the surface infiltration on the surface retrieved from swmm in each time step was simulated as specified flux into the subsurface layers using the recharge rch package the et was simulated using the evt package and the monthly averaged et rate in the study area was used with an et root depth of 0 5 m the river riv package was used to simulate the river boundaries i e clear creek and strawberry creek which was represented as head dependent flux the river stages of these two rivers retrieved from the kitsap public utility district were simply assigned as the heads of these two boundary conditions assuming the rivers are connected to the unconfined aquifer underneath the assumption was deemed reasonable because the base flow of these two creeks was primarily from groundwater discharge during summer sebren 2017 in addition the general head boundary ghb package was used to simulate the boundary of the sea i e dyes inlet and the sea level retrieved from the noaa tides and currents database was assigned as the head of the boundary condition the boundary of the sea was set to be time dependent because the sea level there showed a diurnal fluctuation of 3 to 4 m which could be significant enough to affect the groundwater dynamics in the study area in addition it should be noted that the coupled swmm modflow ran hourly but swmm and mofwlow ran at a time step of 5 min the preconditioned conjugate gradient pcg package was used to solve the finite difference equations in modflow with a maximum number of iterations of 150 a relaxation parameter of 0 97 and a maximum absolute change in head of 0 01 m 2 4 model calibration and validation although some information about the catchment e g thickness of aquifer soil type distribution are available the exact modeling parameter values may still be unknown it is because some parameters are not directly observable e g drainage coefficient of underdrain manning s n of overland flow and conduit depression storages of impervious and pervious areas and some may vary in significant ranges e g hydraulic conductivity specific yield and specific storage of soils thus the parameters were calibrated first the model was calibrated and validated using the monitoring datasets at ckcc site including r o o f s r i p s r p p u d outlet and g w d e p t h as aforementioned data of the first five months i e from 1 october of 2011 to 29 february of 2012 was used for calibration while that for the last seven months i e from 1 march to 30 september of 2012 was used for validation although both swmm and modflow were run at 5 min time step they were coupled only hourly to save computations in other words swmm and modflow each were run for 12 time steps before each round of data exchange between them updating groundwater table depth or recharge rate in swmm and modflow every hour was considered fine enough to capture the surface runoff and groundwater table dynamics during the one year simulation particularly the general groundwater level in the catchment did not fluctuate at a very fine scale based on historical monitoring herrera 2013 it should be noted that the monitoring data used for model calibration was from the central catchment of the area i e ckcc site the red rectangular area in fig 4c however the model built covered the whole catchment to reach the catchment boundaries as mentioned above the calibration approach was similar to that of zhang et al 2018 more specifically a non dominated sorted genetic algorithm nsga ii algorithm originally developed by seshadri 2009 in matlab was utilized after being integrated with swmm modflow the parallel computing package of matlab was utilized using four cores of the cpus to save computation time the algorithm firstly initialized the parameters for calibration mentioned above then invoked the execution of swmm modflow the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse value of the datasets i e r o o f s r i p s r p p u d outlet and g w d e p t h were then computed as the performance indicators based on the objective of maximizing the performance indicators i e nse values the algorithm generated new populations i e new sets of parameters through processes of parent selection crossover crossover probability 0 9 and mutation mutation probability 0 1 out of the population generated number of population 24 the parameters were improved after iterations of generations the calibration was considered completed when the assigned total generation number of generation 10 was reached the number of generations was considered sufficient because the average nse values of the datasets between the 7th and 8th generations did not differ beyond 5 their near optimums were thus considered reached after the 8th generation the final calibrated parameters were manually selected from the last generation of populations by striking a tradeoff among the nse values of the datasets the swmm parameters to be calibrated include underdrain coefficient underdrain exponent the offset height of underdrain saturated hydraulic conductivity the width of sub catchment manning s n for overland flow the depression storage of impervious area as well as the roughness of conduit besides hydraulic conductivity and specific yield were calibrated in modflow 2 5 the hypothetical case studies a series of hypothetical scenarios was formulated to represent different spatial allocation patterns of bcs then one year continuous simulations were performed using the validated model but with different spatial allocation patterns the simulation duration was considered sufficient to capture the groundwater table dynamics because the response time of shallow groundwater was not as long and the model was warmed up sufficiently the results obtained were also considered representative given that the one year period covers a range of rainfall events and groundwater levels the initial conditions of the above simulations were the results from warm up simulations in which there were no bc more specifically inputted with the precipitation time series from september 2001 to august 2011 of 5 min temporal resolution in the study area the warm up simulations were run repeatedly until reaching a dynamic equilibrium i e when the difference of groundwater levels at ten selected grids from different parts of the catchment between two consecutive simulations was within 0 5 2 5 1 rules of spatial allocation of bioretention cells the rules of allocating bcs within the catchment are illustrated as follows and shown in fig 5 basically bcs are allocated as a cluster of practices within each sub catchment the size of each bc is the same which equals to grid size of modflow i e 23 m 23 m firstly the number of gi within each sub catchment is determined which represents the implementation ratio of bc then the central location of the bc cluster is determined bc4 in fig 5 which represents the approximate location of bc within each sub catchment after that the remaining bcs simply surround the central bc circle by circle following a rectangular shaped pattern until reaching the total number of bcs a certain gap i e 0 69 m in this study is kept between each bc the magnitude of which determines the aggregation level of the bc cluster the physically unavailable locations i e pervious areas and locations out of the sub catchment are skipped during the process yellow cell with a red cross in fig 5 the spatial allocation assumes a uniform allocation pattern within each sub catchment this simplification is considered acceptable because this study focuses more on generating generic understanding instead of making detailed planning in addition the surface flow routing between bcs was neglected which may affect the runoff control performance of bcs however this simplification was considered negligible because this study focused more on groundwater table dynamics and the limited information about the site e g high resolution of topography land use and sewer system also hinders the consideration of flow routing between bcs four dimensionless indicators i e ratio gap loc c and loc sc were used to represent the different aspects of spatial allocation of bcs using equations shown in fig 5 these four indicators were selected because they represent the main factors that need to be considered in gi planning as proposed by zhang and chui 2018b ratio represents the implementation ratio of bcs which is the ratio of the total area of bcs n gi n to the total area of available locations for bcs a n eq 4 gap represents the aggregation level of bcs which is calculated by the ratio of average gap size between bcs l gap and the average size of bcs l bc eq 5 loc c represents the relative location of bcs within the catchment which ranges from 0 to 1 a value closer to 0 or 1 means bcs are mainly allocated in upstream or downstream areas respectively after labeling the sub catchments from 1 to n roughly from upstream to downstream the relative location index of each bc is calculated by dividing the index of sub catchment it belongs to loc n by n then loc c is obtained by taking the average of relative location index of all bcs eq 6 loc sc represents the relative location of bcs within the sub catchments which ranges from 0 to 1 similar to loc c a value closer to 0 or 1 means that bcs are mainly allocated near the upper or lower ends of the sub catchments respectively for a specific sub catchment the available locations for bcs are firstly labeled from 1 to a n roughly from upstream to downstream the relative location index of each bc is calculated by dividing the index of grid it belongs to l o c b c m n by a n then loc sc of this sub catchment is obtained by taking the average of relative location index of all bcs within this sub catchment eq 7 4 ratio n b c n a n 5 gap l gap l bc 6 loc c 1 n 1 n n b c n n 1 n n b c n loc n n 7 loc sc 1 n 1 n n b c n n 1 n m 1 n b c n l o c b c m n a n where n represents the total number of sub catchments 14 in this case n bc n represents the total area of bcs in sub catchment n a n represents the total area of available areas for bcs l bc and l gap represent the size of bcs and the gap in between loc n represents the index of sub catchment n and l o c b c m n represents the index of grid the m th bc in sub catchment n the exact ranges of these four indicators are elaborated in the next section the properties of the bcs e g thickness and hydraulic conductivity of media soils followed those of the bcs at the ckcc site mentioned above more specifically the bc constitutes a 300 mm soil layer and a 380 mm storage layer but differently no underdrain was used for each scenario some sub catchment parameters need to be modified in swmm first the width of sub catchments which is one main parameter used to calculate overland flow in swmm was adjusted by multiplying the original value by a ratio of a n n b c n a n because a proportion of the impervious areas is replaced by bcs this approach had been recommended in swmm manuals and adopted by some swmm users rossman 2015 in addition the percentage of impervious area treated by bcs was also adjusted allowing bcs to receive surface runoff from impervious areas that are 20 times larger at most this is within the recommended range in most design standards i e 5 20 times normally dhalla and zimmer 2010 roseen and stone 2013 woods ballard et al 2015 2 5 2 modeling scenarios and outputs a total of 144 scenario based simulations were performed to evaluate the impact of spatial allocation of bcs on surface runoff and groundwater table dynamics the scenarios covered four different implementation ratios of bcs i e ratio of 0 625 1 25 2 5 and 5 four different aggregation levels i e gap of 0 1 2 and 3 three different locations within the whole catchment i e loc c of around 0 5 0 3 and 0 75 when bcs were allocated distributedly throughout all the sub catchments only in upstream or only in downstream sub catchments respectively and three different locations within sub catchments i e loc sc of around 0 1 0 45 and 0 9 when bcs were allocated near the upper end middle section and lower end of sub catchments respectively the ranges of parameters for the hypothetical scenarios are illustrated in table 3 below the scenario without bcs was also simulated and was treated as the base case then the indicators representing the surface runoff and groundwater table dynamics were calculated by comparing the results of the base case with those of the hypothetical cases more specifically the peak reduction pr and volume reduction vr of surface runoff throughout the year in different sub catchments and for the whole catchment were extracted to represent the surface runoff dynamics the peak gr p and temporally averaged gr m groundwater table rises in different sub catchments and for the whole catchment as well as the standard deviation of groundwater levels in the catchment gl std throughout the year were extracted to represent the groundwater table dynamics the three parameters together can comprehensively represent the local and regional change of groundwater levels as well as the uniformity of groundwater levels it should be noted that in general higher runoff control efficiency i e higher pr and vr and more spatially uniform groundwater levels i e lower gr p gr m and gl std are preferred it is because a more uniform groundwater level is resulted by higher recharge in areas of a deeper groundwater tables and lower recharge in areas of a shallower groundwater tables in areas of deeper groundwater table groundwater normally does not pose concerns for gi and other infrastructures they thus can benefit from higher recharge and the increase in groundwater supply while groundwater mound can more easily form in areas of shallower groundwater tables lower recharge can reduce the potential of groundwater mounding and better maintain the performance of gi and other infrastructures it should be noted that although both surface runoff and groundwater table dynamics were reported the major focus was on groundwater table dynamics 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation fig 6 shows the time series of different datasets during both calibration and validation periods the light grey and dark grey sections in figs 6a 6f correspond to the calibration and validation periods respectively one event on 23 december 2011 is shown specifically in figs 6g 6l this event is considered representative given its medium rainfall intensity i e 12 mm h runoff amount i e 23 mm and groundwater table fluctuation i e 0 3 m during the period which can be observed in fig 6 in addition the final calibrated parameters in both swmm and modflow are shown in table 4 which are all within physically reasonable ranges the pipe flow at the outlet of the catchment outlet and surface runoff of r o o f s r showed very good fits with monitoring data with nse of 0 80 and 0 62 during calibration and 0 64 and 0 51 during validation respectively figs 6d and 6e the underdrain flow of p p u d and surface runoff of i p s r were slightly underestimated at rainfall peaks and rises of groundwater table figs 6h and 6i but were still of reasonable goodness of fit the nse of p p u d and i p s r were 0 44 and 0 42 during calibration and 0 50 and 0 41 during validation respectively particularly the goodness of fit of p p u d was even better during the selected event with nse of 0 72 fig 6h generally the goodness of fit of these datasets i e r o o f s r i p s r outlet and p p u d were acceptable ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 which was comparable to that obtained by zhang et al 2018 using swmm lid gw with groundwater monitoring data as direct input comparatively the goodness of fit for g w d e p t h was not as satisfactory with nse of 0 26 and 0 33 during calibration and validation periods respectively fig 6f however the swmm modflow captured the general fluctuations of groundwater table during the period figs 6f and 6l and the goodness of fit during the selected event was reasonably good nse of 0 61 fig 6l the good fits of p p u d and outlet also confirmed the accuracy of groundwater simulation to some extent because they were both highly related to groundwater table depth as shown in zhang et al 2018 the discrepancy could be reduced if there could be more and longer monitoring data for model calibration and if a better understanding about the spatial variation of subsurface geophysical conditions in the study area e g hydraulic conductivity and specific yield could be obtained 3 2 surface runoff dynamics fig 7 shows the surface runoff response represented by peak reduction pr and volume reduction vr of surface runoff at different sub catchments for different implementation ratios of bcs it should be noted that the values shown in the graph fig 7 are the averaged results of other different scenarios in other words fig 7 explicitly shows the results for different ratio and the values in the graph are the averaged results for different gap loc c and loc sc this also applies to other similar graphs i e figs 8 13 as expected pr and vr were greater when there were more bcs more specifically pr and vr for the whole area shown as dashed lines in figs 7b and 7e increased from 1 9 1 3 to 8 6 2 7 22 3 2 8 and 43 6 4 8 and from 4 2 1 7 to 15 1 2 7 35 2 3 1 and 54 5 13 5 when the implementation ratio of bcs increased from 0 625 to 1 25 2 50 and 5 00 respectively considering that this is a highly impermeable catchment around 80 urbanized the impact of bcs may not be as significant for other more permeable catchments furthermore it was found that the impact of implementation ratio was different in different sub catchments using the scenario of implementation ratio of 5 00 as an example pr of s7 s8 and s9 were 56 7 41 2 53 9 40 6 and 52 2 39 9 which were significantly higher than that of s1 s4 s10 and s14 which were around 0 0 0 0 30 4 26 2 43 3 37 0 and 32 9 30 7 fig 7b it was the same case for vr fig 7e the difference was probably caused by differences of imperviousness slope permeability of in situ soils and groundwater table depth in different sub catchments compared to s7 s8 and s9 i e 57 50 7 and 66 2 the imperviousness of s4 s10 and s14 were higher i e 79 1 95 3 and 78 7 and the soils of s4 s10 and s14 i e near the two rivers and the sea are of lower permeability which resulted in lower runoff control efficiency in these areas although sub catchment s1 was lower in imperviousness i e 47 5 the pr and vr there were relatively because of its relatively steeper topography i e average surface slope of 14 than that of other sub catchments which was not beneficial for runoff control in addition groundwater table depth was also found to be influential because the variation of mean groundwater table depth throughout the year in different sub catchments fig 8b showed a similar pattern as that of pr and vr as shown in figs 7b and 7e more specifically among upstream sub catchments i e s1 s6 s2 had a comparatively deeper groundwater table which resulted in a higher runoff control efficiency and among downstream sub catchments i e s7 s14 s9 s10 s12 and s14 had comparatively shallower groundwater tables which resulted in lower runoff control efficiency in these sub catchments this demonstrated the hypothesis of interaction between bc and groundwater in this study and was overall consistent with the mechanism of bc and runoff generation that found in some other existing literature shuster et al 2005 dietz and clausen 2008 ahiablame and shakya 2016 3 3 groundwater table dynamics figs 9 13 compare the response of groundwater table to bcs of different spatial allocations more specifically figs 9 11 12 and 13 show the spatial variation of peak gr p and temporally averaged gr m groundwater table rises within the catchment and fig 10 illustrates the standard deviation of groundwater levels in the catchment gl std throughout the year 3 3 1 impact of the implementation ratio of bioretention cells a small number of bcs can already significantly change the groundwater dynamics for example when averaged over the whole catchment if 0 625 1 25 2 50 and 5 00 of the impervious area was replaced by bcs the peak groundwater rise gr p can be around 0 13 0 05 m 0 34 0 08 m 0 82 0 11 m and 1 31 0 38 m respectively i e dashed lines in figs 9b and 9c at some specific locations the groundwater table rise can be few meters or even higher 5 m during some specific time fig 9d this was a significant change and can be problematic considering the thickness of the unsaturated zone was only from 0 to 5 m in around half of the catchment and 5 out of 14 sub catchments had groundwater table really close to the ground fig 8b in addition it was found that bc not only affects the local groundwater table but also influences the regional groundwater levels when 5 of the catchment was replaced by bcs the groundwater table of the catchment can be 1 m closer to the ground compared with an implementation ratio of 0 625 fig 8c this can be also seen from the significant large area of groundwater table rise i e darker green regions shown in figs 9a and 9e a similar observation was obtained by bhaskar et al 2018 thus it illustrated the importance of considering groundwater table condition in the spatial planning of gi figs 9d and 9h illustrate the exceedance probability curves of gr p and gr m within the catchment which show the proportion of catchment area with different levels of gr p and gr m similarly figs 11d 11 h 12d 12h 13d and 13h illustrate the same information they provide another perspective on the groundwater table dynamics as a result of bcs with more bcs implemented the proportion of catchment area with lower groundwater rises e g 1 0 m for peak rise and 0 4 m for temporally averaged rise was lower while that of higher groundwater rise e g 1 0 m for peak rise and 0 4 m for temporally averaged rise was higher figs 9d and 9h for example if only 0 625 of the impervious area was replaced by bcs around 100 of the catchment had gr p less than 1 0 m and gr m less than 0 2 m however if 5 00 of the catchment was replaced by bcs only 48 and 39 of the catchment had gr p and gr m less than 1 0 m and 0 2 m respectively around 33 14 4 and 2 of the catchment had gr p of 1 2 m 2 3 m 3 4 m and 4 5 m respectively figs 9d and 9h similar to surface runoff the groundwater table response also varied among different sub catchments comparatively sub catchments around the center of the catchment e g s3 and s9 showed higher groundwater table rises than those closer to the catchment boundary e g s1 and s14 figs 9b and 9f a similar observation can be obtained in figs 11 13 this was because the upstream areas were of steeper topography and groundwater hydraulic gradients while the downstream areas were of gentler topography and groundwater hydraulic gradients as a result the groundwater tended to gather in the central sub catchments e g s3 and s9 than sub catchments nearer the boundary this was a quite common phenomenon in sloped areas focusing on a catchment of a similar terrain i e steeper and gentler in upstream and downstream respectively in china cai et al 2016 also found that the groundwater level was higher in the medium section of the catchment the same phenomenon however may not occur in catchments of different topographies for example a more uniform groundwater table rise is expected in relatively flat catchments furthermore as illustrated in fig 10a increasing the implementation level of bcs can slightly decrease the average uniformity of groundwater table due to the greater maximum and minimum gl std values however the differences were not that significant during around 50 of the time the uniformity of groundwater table condition among different implementation ratios was very similar fig 10a thus implementing more bcs with an appropriate allocation strategy may not be unfavorable to the regional groundwater dynamics 3 3 2 impact of the aggregation level of bioretention cells fig 11 compares the response of groundwater table to bcs of different aggregation levels the spatial variation of groundwater table rises was different for different aggregation levels particularly for gr p fig 11a when bcs were more aggregated i e smaller gap the groundwater table rises were also more concentrated fig 11a as a result bcs allocated in a more aggregated pattern formed slightly higher gr p for the overall catchment i e dashed lines in figs 11b and 11c gr p of the catchment was 0 70 0 55 m 0 66 0 51 m 0 65 0 50 m and 0 64 0 48 m when gap was 0 1 2 and 3 respectively it was as expected because more aggregated bcs with a relatively short distance in between may form overlapped groundwater mound endreny and collins 2009 when bcs were more aggregated the proportion of lower gr p areas was smaller while that of higher g r p was greater fig 11d for the same reason gl std of the catchment was slightly higher when bcs were allocated in a more aggregated pattern fig 10b however gr m for the catchment was slightly greater when bcs were allocated in a more distributed pattern fig 11f when bcs were more distributed the proportion of lower gr m areas was smaller while that of higher gr m was greater fig 11h which was different from that of gr p as shown in fig 11d this was possibly because more distributed bcs can affect a greater proportion of area this can be seen from the spatial variation of gr m of the catchment in which the shaded areas were larger when gap was greater fig 11e as a result the overall groundwater table rise of the catchment could be higher although given a relatively lower local groundwater table rise at specific locations however the impact of aggregation level on the regional groundwater table dynamics was relatively minimal compared to that of implementation level this can be seen from the minimal difference of groundwater table depth shown in fig 8d thus to achieve a more spatially uniform groundwater level which is a generally desired condition bcs with more distributed patterns are preferred when groundwater table depth is relatively uniform while when bcs need to be allocated in a more aggregated pattern e g due to site constraints it would be better if they can be allocated in places of a deeper groundwater table 3 3 3 impact of the location of bioretention cells figs 12 and 13 compare the response of groundwater table to bcs allocated at different locations within the catchment and within sub catchments respectively when bcs were spatially distributedly or in upstream areas of the catchment gr p and gr m were greater than those with bcs in downstream areas when bcs were spatially distributed only in upstream areas and only in downstream areas the corresponding gr p for the whole catchment was 0 72 0 66 m 0 70 0 47 m and 0 54 0 33 m i e dashed lines in figs 12b and 12c and the gr m was 0 45 m 0 46 m and 0 31 m respectively i e dashed lines in figs 12f and 12g in addition the proportion of lower groundwater table rise areas i e both gr p and gr m was smaller and that of higher groundwater table rise areas was greater when bcs were spatially distributed and only in upstream areas figs 12d and 12h these phenomena are likely due to two possible reasons first as shown in fig 9 the groundwater table in upstream areas i e s1 s3 s4 s5 and s6 was closer to the ground surface so the groundwater table may respond and rise more quickly and more significantly second it may be resulted by the existence of the regional groundwater hydraulic gradient generally the recharge from bcs in upstream areas can affect the groundwater table conditions in downstream areas more quickly and to a larger spatial extent while recharge in downstream areas normally extends to the surroundings without an obvious direction this can be seen clearly from figs 11b and 11f when bcs were allocated in upstream sub catchments s1 s7 obvious groundwater table rise was observed in some downstream sub catchments s8 s10 while when bcs were allocated in downstream sub catchments s8 s14 the groundwater table also rose at some of the upstream sub catchments i e s2 s3 and s7 but was relatively minimal however the magnitude of this effect may differ for different regional groundwater hydraulic gradients and hydrologic connectivity jones et al 2019 for example the effect may not be as significant for areas of relatively flat topographies a similar phenomenon was observed through comparing the gr m for bcs allocated at different locations within sub catchments fig 13 compared with bcs at the lower end of the sub catchments i e 0 31 0 22 m gr m for the overall catchment was greater when bcs were at the upper end or in the middle section of the sub catchments i e 0 44 0 32 m and 0 46 0 36 m respectively figs 13f and 13g it is because the proportion of higher gr m areas was greater when bcs were allocated at the upper end or middle section of the sub catchments fig 13h in addition the groundwater levels within the catchment was less uniform represented by larger gl std when bcs were allocated in upstream areas and near upper end of sub catchments and vice versa figs 10c and 10d thus when groundwater table is relatively deep bcs generally should be better allocated in upstream areas to result in greater regional groundwater recharge and groundwater table rise while when groundwater table is relatively shallow it is generally better to allocate bcs in the downstream areas to minimize groundwater table rise and the potential influence on the performance of bc however the optimal allocation may vary case by case as some other geophysical conditions should also be considered e g soil distribution furthermore it was found that both gr p and gr m of upstream sub catchments s1 s7 were greater when bcs were allocated at the upper end of the sub catchments while those of downstream sub catchments s9 s14 were greater when bcs were allocated at the lower end of the sub catchments figs 13b and 13f for example when bcs were located at the upper end middle section and lower end gr p of s2 decreased from around 1 01 0 86 m to 0 68 0 61 m and 0 51 0 61 m respectively figs 13b and 13c and gr m of s2 decreased from 0 67 0 62 m to 0 47 0 43 m and 0 30 0 38 m respectively figs 13f and 13g while gr p of s9 increased from 0 72 0 65 m to 1 03 0 93 m and 1 38 1 23 m respectively figs 13b and 13c and gr m of s9 increased from 0 43 0 39 m to 0 54 0 42 m and 0 61 0 46 m respectively figs 13f and 13g this was because the extent of groundwater rise was greater near bcs machusick et al 2011 thomas and vogel 2011 nemirovsky et al 2014 more specifically when bcs in all sub catchments were allocated at the upper end of each sub catchment bcs within the downstream sub catchments were relatively closer to the upstream sub catchments therefore the groundwater recharge by bcs in downstream sub catchments can more easily affect upstream sub catchments resulting in higher groundwater table rise in upstream areas oppositely when bcs were allocated at the lower end of each sub catchment bcs within the upstream sub catchments were relatively closer to the downstream sub catchments then the groundwater recharge by bcs in upstream sub catchments can more easily affect downstream sub catchments resulting in higher groundwater table rise in downstream areas 3 4 relationships between surface runoff and groundwater table dynamics fig 14 illustrates the inter correlations between the responses of surface runoff and groundwater table to bcs of different implementation ratios each dot in the graph represents the data i e either pr vr gr p gr m or gl std for one sub catchment one observation can be obtained from the bar plots along the diagonal of fig 14 more specifically when there was more bcs i e ratio of 5 00 versus others the occurrences of higher pr vr gr p gr m and gl std were greater which was consistent with that observed in pervious sections as expected pr and vr correlated with each other closely with an r 2 of 0 95 while for groundwater table rises only gr p and gr m were closely correlated r 2 of 0 91 gl std was less correlated to the other two indicators r 2 of 0 59 and 0 42 for gr p and gr m respectively in addition the indicators of surface runoff i e pr and vr were also correlated with the indicators of groundwater table rises i e gr p gr m and gl std at a relatively lower but still significant level fig 14 more specifically pr correlated with gr p gr m and gl std with r 2 of 0 85 0 82 and 0 45 respectively and vr correlated with gr p gr m and gl std with r 2 of 0 86 0 84 and 0 45 respectively the observed correlation was not surprising since the reduction of surface runoff and the increase of groundwater recharge were simultaneous outcomes of enhanced infiltration and recharge of gi these observations altogether again reflected the importance of considering the tradeoff between surface runoff control and groundwater protection in gi planning a more ideal gi strategy should reduce surface runoff but also maintain a relatively minimal influence on groundwater dynamics in addition it also demonstrated that an integrated hydrologic model with capacity to characterize the interaction between gi and groundwater is essential for gi planning 4 concluding remarks a coupled surface subsurface hydrological model swmm modflow was developed to evaluate the surface runoff and groundwater table dynamics of green infrastructure of different spatial allocations at catchment scale the model was calibrated and validated using the monitoring data at one urban catchment at kitsap county washington state of the united states using bioretention cells as the representative green infrastructure a series of hypothetical simulations was performed the influence of spatial allocation of bioretention cells represented by the implementation ratio aggregation level and location on surface runoff and groundwater table dynamics was quantified the primary findings are summarized as follows the implementation ratio of bioretention cells was the main spatial feature that governed both surface runoff and groundwater table dynamics with higher implementation ratios the peak reduction and volume reduction of surface runoff were greater and the peak and temporally averaged groundwater table rises were higher however implementing more bioretention cells with an appropriate allocation strategy may not affect the uniformity of regional groundwater levels represented as the standard deviation of regional groundwater levels bioretention cells of more distributedly allocated patterns resulted in slightly lower peak groundwater table rise higher temporally averaged groundwater table rise and lower standard deviation of groundwater levels in the catchment thus if a more uniform groundwater level is desired bioretention cells should be allocated in a more distributed pattern generally while they are recommended to can be allocated in places of deeper groundwater tables when bioretention cells need to be allocated in a more aggregated pattern e g due to site constraints the impact of aggregation level of bioretention cells was relatively low compared to the implementation ratio and relative location of bioretention cells in the catchment allocating bioretention cells upstream resulted in higher groundwater table rises regionally due to the regional groundwater hydraulic gradient thus bioretention cells are recommended to be allocated more upstream in the catchment when the groundwater table is relatively deep to produce a greater regional groundwater recharge and groundwater table rise while they are recommended to be allocated more downstream in the catchment when groundwater table is relatively shallow to minimize groundwater table rise and the potential influence on the performance of bioretention cells in addition the geophysical conditions of and their spatial variations within the catchment should be considered when allocating bioretention cells bioretention cells of greater surface runoff control efficiencies led to higher groundwater table rises thus it is of great importance to consider the tradeoff between surface runoff control and groundwater protection in the planning of green infrastructure and an integrated hydrologic model that can characterize the interaction between green infrastructures and groundwater is essential this study carries certain limitations first the coupled model considered the impact of shallow groundwater on some hydrological processes e g exfiltration underdrain flow and surface runoff but some other processes were neglected for example the impact of shallow groundwater on evapotranspiration of gi was not considered which could be influential in some conditions such as areas of shallow groundwater or arid climate second the rule in allocating bioretention cells spatially in the hypothetical simulations is simplified the detailed land uses e g buildings roads and physical constraints e g underground infrastructures were not considered due to the unavailability of relevant information and a relatively uniform allocation pattern was assumed as a result the main insights obtained in this study may have limited contribution at the scales of single gi practices but they can be beneficial to a higher level planning of gi the simplified rule of spatial allocation of gi practices therefore should not affect the insights which target at regional scales in fact considering the specific physical and or legal constraints of the study area may even affect the transferability of the insights because the constraints can be very different in different areas third the simulations in this study only considered the boundary conditions and hydrogeological conditions of one catchment due to data availability however the results from this study can serve as a general reference for others and the developed model and study methodology can be applied to other catchments to obtain more specific and accurate findings future studies can examine more catchment characteristics e g through the use of more hypothetical catchments and more spatial allocation rules of green infrastructure they can also explore the optimal spatial

5514,the looming impacts of changing climate and ever increasing water and energy demands make it important to quantify expected water and energy availabilities and develop strategies to mitigate expected shortfalls keeping these aspects in mind in this paper hydrological modeling is performed on the upper yangtze river basin uyrb to simulate the inflows to the three gorges reservoir tgr based on the hydrologic engineering center s hydrologic modeling system hec hms model and a multiple input single output linear systematic model mlsm these models are derived for historical 1960 2005 and future near 2021 2050 and far 2061 2090 time periods using bias corrected climate projections from an ensemble of 6 rcms available through the coordinated regional downscaling experiment in east asia cordex ea under representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 and 8 5 simulating with and without snow hydrological responses to both the historical and future climates are fed into a daily reservoir simulation model where the operation of the tgr follows the designed operating rule curves which can be regarded as a standard operating policy sop the results indicate marginal reduction in mean annual precipitation inflow and hydropower generation and mean hydropower generation reliability for the future scenarios under rcp 8 5 with the decreases for far future being more prominent than those for near future the inflow decreases strongly reduce the hydropower generation of the tgr in november and may and have limited impact on other months because of the regulation ability of the sop hydropower generation responses to extreme variations in annual inflow are projected to aggravate the water and energy security stress of the tgr the without snow projections alter the inflow patterns as well as the hydropower generation patterns of the tgr with respect to the with snow projections and are likely to have positive impact on the waterimpounding and hydropower generation for both the historical and future time periods keywords three gorges reservoir climate change bias correction hec hms reservoir operation 1 introduction according to the fifth assessment report ar5 of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014 climate change is expected to enhance rainfall variability and average temperature affecting both the regional water supply and demand leading to the increased occurrences of droughts extreme precipitation low flows and floods frederick and major 1997 the water and energy demand relative to supply is likely to increase rapidly across the globe in the next few decades as increasing population exerts more pressure on ever more limited and uncertain water storages and supplies according to united nations predictions world s water and energy demands would increase by 40 percent and 50 percent respectively by 2030 these environmental changes and demands would greatly influence the operation of water resources infrastructures such as reservoirs tarroja et al 2016 soundharajan et al 2016 consequently it is imperative to quantify water availability and plan strategies to manage and secure water resources for better management of demands in the future many studies have been conducted on the assessment of climate change impacts on the operational performance of reservoir li et al 2009 lopez et al 2009 madani and lund 2010 soundharajan et al 2016 a common framework adopted in these studies first forces hydrological models with projected climate variables largely precipitation and air temperature coming from general circulation models gcms and thereafter drives reservoir operation models with future hydrological responses turner et al 2017 van vliet et al 2016 fowler et al 2003 fed the yorkshire water resource system ywrs model with the streamflow series modeled by a simplified arno hydrologic model under the ukcip98 climate change scenarios the ywrs was projected to have an improved water resources reliability due to the increased winter rainfall but a reduced system resilience and an increased vulnerability to severe drought whose frequency magnitude and duration was projected to increase vicuña et al 2008 investigated the climate change impacts on power generation and revenues of an 11 reservoir hydroelectric system by coupling a linear programming model with the variable infiltration capacity vic model under two gcms and two emission scenarios the authors found that the power generation and revenues decrease under drier hydrologic conditions and increase under wetter hydrologic conditions in a study of the hirakud reservoir india raje and mujumdar 2010 downscaled the climate variables from an ensemble of 3 gcms and simulated monsoon streamflow with a conditional random field model under the sres a2 a1b and b1 scenarios nakićenović et al 2000 when future flood control operations of this reservoir follow the standard operating policy sop using current rule curves authors noted a decrease in the annual hydropower generation power and irrigation reliabilities and an increase in the power deficit ratio and vulnerability climate projections from gcms on coarse scales around 300 km can be dynamically downscaled to finer spatial scales with regional climate models rcms where higher resolution climate projections are valuable for regional as well as local climate change impact assessment dosio et al 2015 xu et al 2019 as rcms use gcm projections as boundary conditions they also carry the inherent uncertainties and biases of the driving gcms dosio et al 2015 further bias correction and or downscaling of rcm projections based on the observed datasets are carried out to bridge the spatial gap and to address the biases d oria et al 2019 the use of rcm projections is becoming increasing popular to generate more reliable estimates of hydrological variables d oria et al 2019 pandey et al 2019 pereira cardenal et al 2014 graham et al 2007 de queiroz et al 2016 transformed the climate variables from the regional eta cptec climate model into water inflows under scenario a1b by using the mgb model and then used a mathematical optimization model to determine the assured energy for a hydro dominant power system in brazil a lower system assured energy was projected for the future climate especially because of the decreased average precipitation and increased drown periods in addition the use of multi model ensemble climate projections is recommended by almost all studies to quantify the model structure uncertainties in the climate change impacts as gcms rcms are recognized as the largest uncertainty contributors wilby and harris 2006 prudhomme and davies 2009 chen et al 2011 chawla and mujumdar 2018 knutti et al 2010 zhang and huang 2013 reshmidevi et al 2018 chilkoti et al 2017 implemented an ensemble of 6 rcms available through coordinated regional downscaling experiment cordex for representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 to develop a hydrological model and study the impacts of climate change on hydropower generation of the c h corn hydroelectric project located on river ochlockonee near tallahassee in florida usa in their study the rcm outputs were bias corrected using the delta change method the seasonal variations in the climate variables corresponding inflow and energy generation were projected to be significant in the future time period 2091 2100 as the world s largest infrastructure investor china provides an excellent setting to examine how environmental changes economic developments and human activities influence natural systems hydropower provides one of the most effective methods to achieve a renewable energy future acknowledging this china has invested considerably to enhance its production and is on track to becoming the world s largest producer of hydroelectricity in this study we explore the impacts of climate change on the water resources of the yangtze river basin in china from an overview of climate change impacts provided by national and regional scales studies the yangtze river basin is projected to experience a small increase in precipitation in future 21st century tian et al 2015 piao et al 2010 tao et al 2012 with sight decrease in streamflow and hydropower generation due to increased evapotranspiration caused by temperature warming liu et al 2016 cao et al 2011 fan et al 2020 zhang et al 2017b many studies have evaluated potential climate change impacts on hydrology especially streamflow using gcm projections in the upstream of the basin wang et al 2015 su et al 2017 birkinshaw et al 2017 however there have been no studies looking into the climate change impacts on hydrology in the upper yangtze river basin uyrb and the operation of the three gorges reservoir tgr which is located at the outlet of the uyrb using high resolution rcm projections a recent study that examines the climate change impacts on the tgr storage and hydropower generation adopts gcm projections from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 qin et al 2019 additionally the inflow of the tgr is highly influenced by both the rainfall and the melting glacier and snow from the uyrb which require investigation as a whole wang et al 2015 su et al 2017 birkinshaw et al 2017 xu et al 2008 and not separately as has been presented before in the literature in the present paper climate projections of 6 rcms from the cordex in east asia cordex ea are used to examine the future climate changes in the uryb under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios the future inflow of the tgr is generated by the hydrological modeling of the uyrb a snow option separates the rainfall and snowmelt impacts when the air temperature is above 0 c noted as with snow for no snow option this option is suppressed noted as without snow the designed operating rule curves are regarded as the sop for the daily operation of the tgr an ensemble average approach is performed on the simulation results to present the average hydrological responses and reservoir operation performance under future scenarios by pooling the results of all 6 rcms the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the study area and data used section 3 demonstrates the methodology in detail section 4 presents the simulation results and discussions and section 5 provides the conclusions drawn from the study 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the yangtze river fig 1 the third longest river in the world and the longest river in china 6418 km lies within the geographical coordinates of 24 n and 35 n latitude and 90 e and 122 e longitude it originates from the northern part of the tibetan plateau flows through 11 provinces autonomous regions and municipalities from west to east and finally reaches the east china sea at the city of shanghai with a drainage area of 1 808 500 km2 accounting for one fifth of the land area of china one third of the chinese population lives within the yangtze river basin and its industry and agriculture generate 30 40 of china s gdp the uyrb extends from the westernmost point to the yichang hydrological station with a length of 4529 km and a drainage basin area of 1 000 000 km2 whose water resources account for almost 40 of those used in the whole yangtze river basin this basin has a subtropical monsoon climate mainly affected by the indian summer monsoon where precipitation is concentrated mainly in the flood season from june to september yang et al 2010 wang et al 2011 since elevation is high in the west and becomes lower as one proceeds towards the east the uyrb has a high hydropower potential the tgr is located 44 km upstream from yichang which is the largest hydro electric power station in the world with 22 500 mw as total installed capacity the tgr has a gross storage capacity of 39 3 km3 and is used for multiple functions including flood control power generation navigation improvement ecological protection and so on it is a key project for the comprehensive utilization of water resources in the yangtze river 2 2 data daily observed meteorological data over 1960 2014

china as shown in table a 1 and fig a 1 of appendix a respectively the digital elevation model dem of the uyrb is extracted from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm dataset available at 90 m

single time scale the 3dbc approach used here corrects the biases in distribution and dependence attributes across multiple variables locations and time scales simultaneously mehrotra and sharma 2019 the basic details of 3dbc are provided in appendix b 3 2 hydrological modeling there are three components of the inflow of the tgr the main upstream inflow controlled by cuntan the tributary inflow controlled by wulong and the runoff from the intervening basin from cuntan and wulong to the dam site the hydrologic engineering center s hydrologic modeling system hec hms model developed by the u s army corps of engineers is adopted to simulate the rainfall and snowmelt runoff processes of the upstream of cuntan and wulong hec hms is capable of both continuous and event based hydrologic modeling so it can be applied to various hydrologicsimulations the primary model components of hec hms are basin models meteorological models and control specifications whose functions can be found in the quick start guide the hec hms 4 3 u s army corps of engineers 2018 is used for this paper along with the geospatial hydrologic modeling extension hec geohms version 10 1 and data storage system visual utility engine hec dssvue version 2 01 the upstream of cuntan is divided into 37 sub basins while that of wulong is divided into 7 sub basins using hec geohms hec hms provides several options for mathematical modelling of each component of the runoff process soil conservation service scs curve number cn scs unit hydrograph uh nonlinear boussinesq and muskingum routing options are selected to compute flows meanwhile the hargreaves and temperature index methods are selected for evapotranspiration calculation and snowmelt module respectively allen et al 1998 hargreaves and samani 1985 hock 2003 the main reasons for choosing these methods are the applicability and limitations availability of parameters and well established researcher recommendations hong and adler 2008 song et al 2011 kure et al 2013 meenu et al 2013 halwatura and najim 2013 birkinshaw et al 2017 the inbuilt snowmelt module of hec hms with temperature index option is used to simulate the snow melt runoff the output of the module is the liquid water available at the soil surface lwass which is added to the input precipitation hyetograph of the sub basin runoff model the details and initial parameters of hec hms along with snow melt component can be found in appendix c the native simplex automated and manual calibration methods are used in combination to adjust parameters for guiding the objective function towards better agreement between simulated and observed hydrographs the observed daily streamflows of cuntan and wulong over 2007 2014 are used for calibration and those over 1976 1983 are used for validation meanwhile the data from 1970 to 1975 are used to warm up the models precipitation and evapotranspiration time series are averaged using thiessen polygons to calculate the mean net precipitation precipitation evapotranspiration of the intervening basin as most of the inflow to the tgr comes from the streamflows of cuntan and wulong li et al 2010 for simplicity we assume the mean net precipitation in the intervening basin as the runoff from this part the goodness of fit between simulated and observed hydrographs is measured by the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient of determination r2 and percent bias pbias moriasi et al 2007 the precipitation and air temperature under multiple scenarios are supplied as input for the hydrological modeling of the upstream of cuntan and wulong and of the intervening basin these three components are added together by a multiple input single output linear systematic model mlsm to generate the inflow of the tgr the details and parameters of the mlsm can be found in li et al 2010 in the developed hec hms models precipitation and air temperature are the only control input for snowmelt as one of the options of our analysis involves no snow condition we run the flow model by increasing all air temperature above 0 c to make the snowmelt module of the hec hms models as redundant note that air temperature is increased after evapotranspiration calculation which means that the increased air temperature is only applied to influence the snowmelt modules the snowmelt in the intervening basin is omitted because its effects are little in both the historical and future time periods 3 3 reservoir simulation model relating the decision variables release hydropower output and water supply of the reservoir to the state variables water level inflow and time at daily or monthly time scales constitutes the most common way of forming and operating the rule curves in this paper a simple daily simulation model is developed to assess the operational performance of the tgr this simulation model allocates water for flood control hydropower generation navigation water supply and other regulatory objectives and updates daily water level based on operating rule curves water level at the beginning of the day and inflows as the primary goal of the study is to make an assessment of the tgr s operations under future climate change scenarios the reservoir operations are assumed to follow the designed operating rule curves fig 2 which are specified at design time using historical data and are regarded as the sop ignoring others optimal operating rules proposed by researchers in the literature shen et al 2018 shang et al 2018 as shown in fig 2 the whole operation chart of the tgr is divided into four zones by rule curves the non flood season starts on 1th october and ends on 10th june of next year during the refill period from 1th october to 31th october the tgr aims to raise its water level gradually from the flood limit water level of 145 m to the normal water level of 175 m from 1th november to 30th april of the following year the tgr aims to keep its water level as high as possible to generate more hydropower the water level is expected to be lowered gradually in this period but is not allowed to go below the dry control water level of 155 m to meet the navigation requirement during the drawdown period from 1th may to 10th june the water level of the tgr should gradually drop down to 155 m by 31th may and further down to 145 m by 10th june generally the tgr should remain at 145 m during the flood season from 11th june to 30th september to provide enough capacity to store the flood water zone d between 145 m and 175 m gives the tgr enough flood storage capacity to impound a 1000 year design flood once the water level lies in zone a the hydropower station should increase the hydropower output to make the water level return to zone b where the hydropower output should be the firm hydropower output of 4990 mw if the water level drops down to zone c the hydropower output should decrease linearly according to the inserted water level method the hydropower output of the tgr for the day t can be formulated as 1 n t min k q t p h t n max where nt and nmax are the hydropower output and installed capacity respectively mw k is the hydropower output coefficient with value as 8 8 for the tgr m s2 q t p is the average hydropower discharge rate m3 s ht is the average water head which is a function of the average storage and outflow m 3 4 metrics to assess the effects of projected climate change on the operation of the tgr certain annual metrics for inflow hydropower generation and water level are measured in this paper mean annual inflow mai mean length of negative run called run length hereafter and defined as the consecutive number of days that the inflow is below the mean yevjevich 1967 mrl occurrence percentage of run lengths oprl and mean maximum max and minimum min daily inflows are used to evaluate the changes in the inflow of the tgr note that run lengths greater than the 80 historical length only are considered here to specifically focus on the extreme dry periods likewise mean annual hydropower generation mahg mean hydropower generation reliability mhgr and mean full load rate mflr are used to measure the hydropower performance of the tgr the hydropower generation reliability is the percentage of days that the hydropower output equals or exceeds the firm hydropower while the full load rate is the probability that the tgr operate at the installed capacity finally fully filled rate ffr mean first full fill day mfffd and mean average water level in the non flood season mawlns are selected to demonstrate the water level behavior of the tgr the ffr is defined as the frequency of years that the maximum water level reaches the normal water level while the first full fill day is the number of days since 1st june that the water level reaches the normal water level for the first time the average water level in the non flood season is the average value of all water levels during the non flood season in addition the standard deviations are also calculated to demonstrate the variations across years 4 results 4 1 hec hms calibration and validation the hec hms models for the upstream of cuntan and wulong are calibrated by comparing the simulated and observed daily streamflows over the calibration period and then validated in the same manner over the validation period the performance metrics between the observed and simulated daily streamflow series depict that the model performance can be considered as very good both for the calibration for cuntan nse 0 85 r2 0 87 pbias 8 8 for wulong nse 0 81 r2 0 81 pbias 11 7 and validation for cuntan nse 0 83 r2 0 86 pbias 3 0 for wulong nse 0 86 r2 0 88 pbias 15 9 periods the comparison plots fig 3 show that the simulated daily streamflow by the calibrated hec hms models matches well with the observed streamflow series 4 2 future projections daily time series of precipitation maximum and minimum air temperatures of the 6 rcms are interpolated and bias corrected at each meteorological station and finally weighted averaged over uyrb the tgr inflow time series is simulated by using the calibrated hydrological model and the rcm climate variables with the sop employed the tgr hydropower generation is calculated by first forcing the daily reservoir inflows from each rcm into the reservoir simulation model and then aggregating to monthly and annual time scales for the historical near and far future time periods and calculating metrics the ensemble average annual exceedance probabilities and mean monthly simulated values of bias corrected precipitation maximum and minimum air temperatures are plotted in figs a 2 and a 3 respectively for the historical and future time periods for the sake of brevity only the future results simulated with snow under rcp 8 5 are presented in detail while those under rcp 4 5 are provided in figs a 4 a 8 and tables a 2 a 3 of appendix a under rcp 8 5 the ensemble average annual exceedance probabilities of the inflow and hydropower generation of the tgr are presented in fig 4 nominal decreases in mai and mahg are noted for the near and far future time periods mai is estimated to reduce by 2 0 and 4 5 while mahg is projected to decrease by 2 2 and 5 1 respectively larger reductions in the projected future mahgs could be because of the fact that the tgr cannot take full use of peak inflows during the flood season for hydropower generation since its operation is governed by the sop for flood control from fig 4 the future annual inflows and hydropower generations show overall decreases at almost all exceedance probabilities with respect to the historical period these reductions are appreciable at middle and high exceedance probabilities and reduce progressively as exceedance probability decreases the exceedance probability patterns of annual hydropower generations across the historical and future time periods closely follow those of annual inflows indicating that the projected changes in the hydropower generation of the tgr come mainly from those in the reservoir inflow fig 5 presents the mean monthly percentage changes in the inflow and hydropower generation of the tgr under rcp 8 5 a consistent decrease throughout most of the year can be seen in the future ensemble average simulations of mean monthly inflow fig 5a and b the inconsistency in the projected changes of the mean monthly inflows and climate variables fig a 2 suggests that the changes in inflow not only primarily relate to the precipitation changes but also to the changes in temperature which affects snowmelt and evapotranspiration to access ensemble average changes in the mean monthly hydropower generation we mainly focus on the november and may months where the most changes occur fig 5c and d in these two months hydropower generation of the tgr is projected to be reduced by 5 2 13 0 for the future scenarios in the other non flood months nominal changes are projected in the future following the sop the tgr cannot effectively make use of peak flows for hydropower generation during the flood season when the rate of inflow exceeds the maximum flow rate of the turbines therefore notwithstanding decreased inflow the changes of hydropower generation and mflr caused by the inflow decrease is limited likewise the inflow decreases during the refill period although reduces the ffr and delays the mfffd would have limited impact on hydropower generation in this period because of the firm hydropower output requirement during the following period before the end of april the tgr tends to store water for may and keep water level as high as possible hydropower generation is reduced strongly when the water level remains at the normal water level but weakly affected when the water level lies in the firm hydropower output zone decreased hydropower is generated when the water level falls below the lower boundary curve as shown in fig 2 the inflow decreases will cause a significant reduction in the mhgr and the hydropower generation during the drawdown period since the tgr should be emptied before the flood season the ensemble average values for the inflow and hydropower generation metrics of the tgr under rcp 8 5 are given in table 2 the severity and frequency of extreme dry period are projected to have small changes in the future scenarios the tgr is projected to have decreased max and min in the future with the reductions for far future being more prominent than those for near future the decreased mhgr indicates that the tgr will face more severe challenges for the firm hydropower output in the future while the mflr shows negligible changes for the future scenarios indicating limited affects caused by the decreased max finally fig 6 demonstrates the mean water level behavior of the tgr for the two future time periods under the rcp 8 5 scenario the ensemble average lines historical and averaged lines indicate that the mean operating water levels in the non flood season will reduce for the future scenarios the mawlns decreases by 0 5 and 1 6 m respectively for the near and far future time periods with respect to the historical time period special attention is also paid to the metrics ffr and mfffd of the tgr which are sensitive to the reservoir inflow reductions during the refill period it can be seen that for the near and far future scenarios the ffr will have remarkable decreases of 8 8 and 22 6 and the mfffd will be delayed by 1 5 and 3 5 days respectively 5 discussion 5 1 water and energy security in the future response to extreme variations in annual inflow although the effect on annual hydropower generation caused by projected change in annual inflow in wet years is limited the frequency of dry years is projected to increase in the near and far future time periods as indicated by the decreases in the annual inflows corresponding to 90 100 exceedance probabilities leading to water stress on hydropower generation especially the firm hydropower output we focus on extreme variations in annual inflow to assess the water and energy security of the tgr for the future scenarios the wettest and driest variations are determined by first finding the maximum and minimum annual inflows for each rcm and then averaging the corresponding attributes across the 6 rcms for the evaluation period with respect to the historical period the future annual inflow and hydropower generation hydropower generation reliability and full load rate are projected to vary from 6 2 to 2 4 8 1 to 0 3 13 3 to 2 0 and 1 7 to 0 respectively for both the extreme variations fig 7 accordingly the tgr is estimated to have lower average water levels in the non flood season for the future scenarios corresponding to the wettest variation any reduction in peak inflows which exceed the maximum flow rate of the turbines may have no effect on hydropower generation therefore annual inflow reduction cannot guarantee a similar change in annual hydropower generation and full load rate on the other hand since the full load rate is close to zero in both the historical and future time periods for the driest variation annual inflow decrease has a strong positive relationship with the reduction in annual hydropower generation for both the wettest and driest variations the lower average water levels in the non flood season decrease the hydropower generation reliability increasing threats to the water and energy security of the tgr 5 2 comparison between with and without snow projections under subtropical monsoon zone snow accumulation and melt in the winter are significant in approximately 25 of the uyrb and occasional in other portions birkinshaw et al 2017 during the hydrological modeling of the uyrb inflow projections of the tgr are also generated without snow for historical and rcp 8 5 and are presented in fig 8 compared with the projections with snow mean monthly inflow and hydropower generation without snow are projected to increase from october to january which can be ascribed to the seasonal variations of snow accumulation and melt in the uyrb these increases will improve the ffr and advance the mfffd further lead to the increase in the mhgr which is in accordance with the increase in the mawlns however the corresponding changes in mai and mahg are marginal since some mean monthly increases and decreases can cancel each other out comparison between the simulations with and without snow shows that the decreased snow accumulation and increase snow melt caused by increasing temperature have positive effect on the hydropower generation however a previous study has revealed that on average only 2 0 of natural runoff in the uyrb comes from meltwater fang et al 2017 the differences between the projections with and without snow should be nominal especially for future climate warming 5 3 impact of emission scenarios and regional climate models the ensemble average projections of the 6 rcms demonstrate that there will be a decrease in future mean annual precipitation for both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 and the decreases in mai and mahg of the tgr under rcp 4 5 are smaller than those under rcp 8 5 due to the smaller decrease in the mean annual precipitation under rcp 4 5 nevertheless future projections exhibit large spreads across the 6 rcms without agreement in the direction of changes fig 9 among these rcms hadgem3 predicts wetter results with increases in precipitation and inflow in the future the mahg is estimated to increase by 2 7 6 1 in the near future time period and by 8 0 9 0 in the far future time period on the contrary clmhadgem2 shows the largest decreases in future projections where the mahg is estimated to decrease by 6 7 7 3 in the near future time period and by 8 1 13 3 in the far future time period under these two rcms the tgr is predicted to have the highest and lowest mean water levels during the non flood season figs 6 and s6 respectively as indicated above large variations in the future projections are projected by different rcps and rcms in this paper 6 rcms under two rcps can only capture a fraction of the range of possible future climate changes for the uyrb therefore it is important to reveal the mechanisms of inflow and hydropower generation responses to climate change using the obtained projections across all rcms and rcps fig a 9 linear relationships between the projected changes in inflow and hydropower generation with projected changes in precipitation and non linear relationships between the projected changes in inflow and hydropower generation with projected changes in temperature are obtained generally decreased precipitation causes decreased inflow and hydropower generation and increased temperature causes increased evapotranspiration and snowmelt therefore the inflow and hydropower generation responses to precipitation change are simple but those to temperature are more complicated 6 conclusions it is important that major water infrastructure as re assessed to quantify water availability and assess plans for optimal management of water resources for drinking agriculture and hydropower generation in a changing climate in the study we focus on the operation of one of the largest hydropower projects in the world the three gorges reservoir tgr in china with the aim of assessing the impact of climate change on the sustainability of its water and energy future precipitation and temperature projections are extracted from the 6 rcms available under the cordex ea project under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 and then bias corrected for deriving the hydrological modeling of the uyrb reservoir inflows generated with and without snow using the bias corrected precipitation and temperatures are used to simulate the daily operation of the tgr for both the historical 1960 2005 and future near 2021 2050 and far 2061 2090 time periods the ensemble average projections by averaging the relevant attributes across the 6 rcms on both annual and monthly scales are presented to analyze the climate change impacts on the operation of the tgr the output of the 6 rcms project different future climate changes for both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 the ensemble average statistics of the 6 rcms suggest that there will be a decrease in future mean annual precipitation for these two rcps which is inconsistent with the findings of the most of the previous studies tian et al 2015 piao et al 2010 tao et al 2012 chen and frauenfeld 2014 lee et al 2014 these differences may be attributed to different climate data sources models and bias correction approach used mean annual inflow and hydropower generation of the tgr are projected to have small decreases for both the near and far futures under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 changes in hydropower generations are strongly related to the variations in inflows however are also influenced by the installed capacity of the tgr and the operating rule curves in place at monthly time scale changes in reservoir inflows have different impact on the magnitude of hydropower generation changes because of the varying designed operating rule curves for different months with these rules hydropower generation of the tgr is less sensitive to the inflow changes during the flood season from june to september and has obviously different responses for months in the non flood season from october to may the inflow decreases strongly reduce the hydropower generation of the tgr in november and may and have limited impact on other months the extreme variations in annual inflow are projected to aggravate the water and energy security stress of the tgr by reducing the hydropower generation reliability in addition the without snow projections alter the inflow patterns as well as the hydropower generation patterns of the tgr with respect to the with snow projections and the nominal inflow increases from october to january are likely to have positive impact on the waterimpounding and hydropower generation for both the historical and future time periods our results might carry the limitations of the hydrologic and bias

5514,the looming impacts of changing climate and ever increasing water and energy demands make it important to quantify expected water and energy availabilities and develop strategies to mitigate expected shortfalls keeping these aspects in mind in this paper hydrological modeling is performed on the upper yangtze river basin uyrb to simulate the inflows to the three gorges reservoir tgr based on the hydrologic engineering center s hydrologic modeling system hec hms model and a multiple input single output linear systematic model mlsm these models are derived for historical 1960 2005 and future near 2021 2050 and far 2061 2090 time periods using bias corrected climate projections from an ensemble of 6 rcms available through the coordinated regional downscaling experiment in east asia cordex ea under representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 and 8 5 simulating with and without snow hydrological responses to both the historical and future climates are fed into a daily reservoir simulation model where the operation of the tgr follows the designed operating rule curves which can be regarded as a standard operating policy sop the results indicate marginal reduction in mean annual precipitation inflow and hydropower generation and mean hydropower generation reliability for the future scenarios under rcp 8 5 with the decreases for far future being more prominent than those for near future the inflow decreases strongly reduce the hydropower generation of the tgr in november and may and have limited impact on other months because of the regulation ability of the sop hydropower generation responses to extreme variations in annual inflow are projected to aggravate the water and energy security stress of the tgr the without snow projections alter the inflow patterns as well as the hydropower generation patterns of the tgr with respect to the with snow projections and are likely to have positive impact on the waterimpounding and hydropower generation for both the historical and future time periods keywords three gorges reservoir climate change bias correction hec hms reservoir operation 1 introduction according to the fifth assessment report ar5 of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014 climate change is expected to enhance rainfall variability and average temperature affecting both the regional water supply and demand leading to the increased occurrences of droughts extreme precipitation low flows and floods frederick and major 1997 the water and energy demand relative to supply is likely to increase rapidly across the globe in the next few decades as increasing population exerts more pressure on ever more limited and uncertain water storages and supplies according to united nations predictions world s water and energy demands would increase by 40 percent and 50 percent respectively by 2030 these environmental changes and demands would greatly influence the operation of water resources infrastructures such as reservoirs tarroja et al 2016 soundharajan et al 2016 consequently it is imperative to quantify water availability and plan strategies to manage and secure water resources for better management of demands in the future many studies have been conducted on the assessment of climate change impacts on the operational performance of reservoir li et al 2009 lopez et al 2009 madani and lund 2010 soundharajan et al 2016 a common framework adopted in these studies first forces hydrological models with projected climate variables largely precipitation and air temperature coming from general circulation models gcms and thereafter drives reservoir operation models with future hydrological responses turner et al 2017 van vliet et al 2016 fowler et al 2003 fed the yorkshire water resource system ywrs model with the streamflow series modeled by a simplified arno hydrologic model under the ukcip98 climate change scenarios the ywrs was projected to have an improved water resources reliability due to the increased winter rainfall but a reduced system resilience and an increased vulnerability to severe drought whose frequency magnitude and duration was projected to increase vicuña et al 2008 investigated the climate change impacts on power generation and revenues of an 11 reservoir hydroelectric system by coupling a linear programming model with the variable infiltration capacity vic model under two gcms and two emission scenarios the authors found that the power generation and revenues decrease under drier hydrologic conditions and increase under wetter hydrologic conditions in a study of the hirakud reservoir india raje and mujumdar 2010 downscaled the climate variables from an ensemble of 3 gcms and simulated monsoon streamflow with a conditional random field model under the sres a2 a1b and b1 scenarios nakićenović et al 2000 when future flood control operations of this reservoir follow the standard operating policy sop using current rule curves authors noted a decrease in the annual hydropower generation power and irrigation reliabilities and an increase in the power deficit ratio and vulnerability climate projections from gcms on coarse scales around 300 km can be dynamically downscaled to finer spatial scales with regional climate models rcms where higher resolution climate projections are valuable for regional as well as local climate change impact assessment dosio et al 2015 xu et al 2019 as rcms use gcm projections as boundary conditions they also carry the inherent uncertainties and biases of the driving gcms dosio et al 2015 further bias correction and or downscaling of rcm projections based on the observed datasets are carried out to bridge the spatial gap and to address the biases d oria et al 2019 the use of rcm projections is becoming increasing popular to generate more reliable estimates of hydrological variables d oria et al 2019 pandey et al 2019 pereira cardenal et al 2014 graham et al 2007 de queiroz et al 2016 transformed the climate variables from the regional eta cptec climate model into water inflows under scenario a1b by using the mgb model and then used a mathematical optimization model to determine the assured energy for a hydro dominant power system in brazil a lower system assured energy was projected for the future climate especially because of the decreased average precipitation and increased drown periods in addition the use of multi model ensemble climate projections is recommended by almost all studies to quantify the model structure uncertainties in the climate change impacts as gcms rcms are recognized as the largest uncertainty contributors wilby and harris 2006 prudhomme and davies 2009 chen et al 2011 chawla and mujumdar 2018 knutti et al 2010 zhang and huang 2013 reshmidevi et al 2018 chilkoti et al 2017 implemented an ensemble of 6 rcms available through coordinated regional downscaling experiment cordex for representative concentration pathway rcp 4 5 to develop a hydrological model and study the impacts of climate change on hydropower generation of the c h corn hydroelectric project located on river ochlockonee near tallahassee in florida usa in their study the rcm outputs were bias corrected using the delta change method the seasonal variations in the climate variables corresponding inflow and energy generation were projected to be significant in the future time period 2091 2100 as the world s largest infrastructure investor china provides an excellent setting to examine how environmental changes economic developments and human activities influence natural systems hydropower provides one of the most effective methods to achieve a renewable energy future acknowledging this china has invested considerably to enhance its production and is on track to becoming the world s largest producer of hydroelectricity in this study we explore the impacts of climate change on the water resources of the yangtze river basin in china from an overview of climate change impacts provided by national and regional scales studies the yangtze river basin is projected to experience a small increase in precipitation in future 21st century tian et al 2015 piao et al 2010 tao et al 2012 with sight decrease in streamflow and hydropower generation due to increased evapotranspiration caused by temperature warming liu et al 2016 cao et al 2011 fan et al 2020 zhang et al 2017b many studies have evaluated potential climate change impacts on hydrology especially streamflow using gcm projections in the upstream of the basin wang et al 2015 su et al 2017 birkinshaw et al 2017 however there have been no studies looking into the climate change impacts on hydrology in the upper yangtze river basin uyrb and the operation of the three gorges reservoir tgr which is located at the outlet of the uyrb using high resolution rcm projections a recent study that examines the climate change impacts on the tgr storage and hydropower generation adopts gcm projections from the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 qin et al 2019 additionally the inflow of the tgr is highly influenced by both the rainfall and the melting glacier and snow from the uyrb which require investigation as a whole wang et al 2015 su et al 2017 birkinshaw et al 2017 xu et al 2008 and not separately as has been presented before in the literature in the present paper climate projections of 6 rcms from the cordex in east asia cordex ea are used to examine the future climate changes in the uryb under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios the future inflow of the tgr is generated by the hydrological modeling of the uyrb a snow option separates the rainfall and snowmelt impacts when the air temperature is above 0 c noted as with snow for no snow option this option is suppressed noted as without snow the designed operating rule curves are regarded as the sop for the daily operation of the tgr an ensemble average approach is performed on the simulation results to present the average hydrological responses and reservoir operation performance under future scenarios by pooling the results of all 6 rcms the remainder of this paper is structured as follows section 2 describes the study area and data used section 3 demonstrates the methodology in detail section 4 presents the simulation results and discussions and section 5 provides the conclusions drawn from the study 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the yangtze river fig 1 the third longest river in the world and the longest river in china 6418 km lies within the geographical coordinates of 24 n and 35 n latitude and 90 e and 122 e longitude it originates from the northern part of the tibetan plateau flows through 11 provinces autonomous regions and municipalities from west to east and finally reaches the east china sea at the city of shanghai with a drainage area of 1 808 500 km2 accounting for one fifth of the land area of china one third of the chinese population lives within the yangtze river basin and its industry and agriculture generate 30 40 of china s gdp the uyrb extends from the westernmost point to the yichang hydrological station with a length of 4529 km and a drainage basin area of 1 000 000 km2 whose water resources account for almost 40 of those used in the whole yangtze river basin this basin has a subtropical monsoon climate mainly affected by the indian summer monsoon where precipitation is concentrated mainly in the flood season from june to september yang et al 2010 wang et al 2011 since elevation is high in the west and becomes lower as one proceeds towards the east the uyrb has a high hydropower potential the tgr is located 44 km upstream from yichang which is the largest hydro electric power station in the world with 22 500 mw as total installed capacity the tgr has a gross storage capacity of 39 3 km3 and is used for multiple functions including flood control power generation navigation improvement ecological protection and so on it is a key project for the comprehensive utilization of water resources in the yangtze river 2 2 data daily observed meteorological data over 1960 2014

the basic details of 3dbc are provided in appendix b 3 2 hydrological modeling there are three components of the inflow of the tgr the main upstream inflow controlled by cuntan the tributary inflow controlled by wulong and the runoff from the intervening basin from cuntan and wulong to the dam site the hydrologic engineering center s hydrologic modeling system hec hms model developed by the u s army corps of engineers is adopted to simulate the rainfall and snowmelt runoff processes of the upstream of cuntan and wulong hec hms is capable of both continuous and event based hydrologic modeling so it can be applied to various hydrologicsimulations the primary model components of hec hms are basin models meteorological models and control specifications whose functions can be found in the quick start guide the hec hms 4 3 u s army corps of engineers 2018 is used for this paper along with the geospatial hydrologic modeling extension hec geohms version 10 1 and data storage system visual utility engine hec dssvue version 2 01 the upstream of cuntan is divided into 37 sub basins while that of wulong is divided into 7 sub basins using hec geohms hec hms provides several options for mathematical modelling of each component of the runoff process soil conservation service scs curve number cn scs unit hydrograph uh nonlinear boussinesq and muskingum routing options are selected to compute flows meanwhile the hargreaves and temperature index methods are selected for evapotranspiration calculation and snowmelt module respectively allen et al 1998 hargreaves and samani 1985 hock 2003 the main reasons for choosing these methods are the applicability and limitations availability of parameters and well established researcher recommendations hong and adler 2008 song et al 2011 kure et al 2013 meenu et al 2013 halwatura and najim 2013 birkinshaw et al 2017 the inbuilt snowmelt module of hec hms with temperature index option is used to simulate the snow melt runoff the output of the module is the liquid water available at the soil surface lwass which is added to the input precipitation hyetograph of the sub basin runoff model the details and initial parameters of hec hms along with snow melt component can be found in appendix c the native simplex automated and manual calibration methods are used in combination to adjust parameters for guiding the objective function towards better agreement between simulated and observed hydrographs the observed daily streamflows of cuntan and wulong over 2007 2014 are used for calibration and those over 1976 1983 are used for validation meanwhile the data from 1970 to 1975 are used to warm up the models precipitation and evapotranspiration time series are averaged using thiessen polygons to calculate the mean net precipitation precipitation evapotranspiration of the intervening basin as most of the inflow to the tgr comes from the streamflows of cuntan and wulong li et al 2010 for simplicity we assume the mean net precipitation in the intervening basin as the runoff from this part the goodness of fit between simulated and observed hydrographs is measured by the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient of determination r2 and percent bias pbias moriasi et al 2007 the precipitation and air temperature under multiple scenarios are supplied as input for the hydrological modeling of the upstream of cuntan and wulong and of the intervening basin these three components are added together by a multiple input single output linear systematic model mlsm to generate the inflow of the tgr the details and parameters of the mlsm can be found in li et al 2010 in the developed hec hms models precipitation and air temperature are the only control input for snowmelt as one of the options of our analysis involves no snow condition we run the flow model by increasing all air temperature above 0 c to make the snowmelt module of the hec hms models as redundant note that air temperature is increased after evapotranspiration calculation which means that the increased air temperature is only applied to influence the snowmelt modules the snowmelt in the intervening basin is omitted because its effects are little in both the historical and future time periods 3 3 reservoir simulation model relating the decision variables release hydropower output and water supply of the reservoir to the state variables water level inflow and time at daily or monthly time scales constitutes the most common way of forming and operating the rule curves in this paper a simple daily simulation model is developed to assess the operational performance of the tgr this simulation model allocates water for flood control hydropower generation navigation water supply and other regulatory objectives and updates daily water level based on operating rule curves water level at the beginning of the day and inflows as the primary goal of the study is to make an assessment of the tgr s operations under future climate change scenarios the reservoir operations are assumed to follow the designed operating rule curves fig 2 which are specified at design time using historical data and are regarded as the sop ignoring others optimal operating rules proposed by researchers in the literature shen et al 2018 shang et al 2018 as shown in fig 2 the whole operation chart of the tgr is divided into four zones by rule curves the non flood season starts on 1th october and ends on 10th june of next year during the refill period from 1th october to 31th october the tgr aims to raise its water level gradually from the flood limit water level of 145 m to the normal water level of 175 m from 1th november to 30th april of the following year the tgr aims to keep its water level as high as possible to generate more hydropower the water level is expected to be lowered gradually in this period but is not allowed to go below the dry control water level of 155 m to meet the navigation requirement during the drawdown period from 1th may to 10th june the water level of the tgr should gradually drop down to 155 m by 31th may and further down to 145 m by 10th june generally the tgr should remain at 145 m during the flood season from 11th june to 30th september to provide enough capacity to store the flood water zone d between 145 m and 175 m gives the tgr enough flood storage capacity to impound a 1000 year design flood once the water level lies in zone a the hydropower station should increase the hydropower output to make the water level return to zone b where the hydropower output should be the firm hydropower output of 4990 mw if the water level drops down to zone c the hydropower output should decrease linearly according to the inserted water level method the hydropower output of the tgr for the day t can be formulated as 1 n t min k q t p h t n max where nt and nmax are the hydropower output and installed capacity respectively mw k is the hydropower output coefficient with value as 8 8 for the tgr m s2 q t p is the average hydropower discharge rate m3 s ht is the average water head which is a function of the average storage and outflow m 3 4 metrics to assess the effects of projected climate change on the operation of the tgr certain annual metrics for inflow hydropower generation and water level are measured in this paper mean annual inflow mai mean length of negative run called run length hereafter and defined as the consecutive number of days that the inflow is below the mean yevjevich 1967 mrl occurrence percentage of run lengths oprl and mean maximum max and minimum min daily inflows are used to evaluate the changes in the inflow of the tgr note that run lengths greater than the 80 historical length only are considered here to specifically focus on the extreme dry periods likewise mean annual hydropower generation mahg mean hydropower generation reliability mhgr and mean full load rate mflr are used to measure the hydropower performance of the tgr the hydropower generation reliability is the percentage of days that the hydropower output equals or exceeds the firm hydropower while the full load rate is the probability that the tgr operate at the installed capacity finally fully filled rate ffr mean first full fill day mfffd and mean average water level in the non flood season mawlns are selected to demonstrate the water level behavior of the tgr the ffr is defined as the frequency of years that the maximum water level reaches the normal water level while the first full fill day is the number of days since 1st june that the water level reaches the normal water level for the first time the average water level in the non flood season is the average value of all water levels during the non flood season in addition the standard deviations are also calculated to demonstrate the variations across years 4 results 4 1 hec hms calibration and validation the hec hms models for the upstream of cuntan and wulong are calibrated by comparing the simulated and observed daily streamflows over the calibration period and then validated in the same manner over the validation period the performance metrics between the observed and simulated daily streamflow series depict that the model performance can be considered as very good both for the calibration for cuntan nse 0 85 r2 0 87 pbias 8 8 for wulong nse 0 81 r2 0 81 pbias 11 7 and validation for cuntan nse 0 83 r2 0 86 pbias 3 0 for wulong nse 0 86 r2 0 88 pbias 15 9 periods the comparison plots fig 3 show that the simulated daily streamflow by the calibrated hec hms models matches well with the observed streamflow series 4 2 future projections daily time series of precipitation maximum and minimum air temperatures of the 6 rcms are interpolated and bias corrected at each meteorological station and finally weighted averaged over uyrb the tgr inflow time series is simulated by using the calibrated hydrological model and the rcm climate variables with the sop employed the tgr hydropower generation is calculated by first forcing the daily reservoir inflows from each rcm into the reservoir simulation model and then aggregating to monthly and annual time scales for the historical near and far future time periods and calculating metrics the ensemble average annual exceedance probabilities and mean monthly simulated values of bias corrected precipitation maximum and minimum air temperatures are plotted in figs a 2 and a 3 respectively for the historical and future time periods for the sake of brevity only the future results simulated with snow under rcp 8 5 are presented in detail while those under rcp 4 5 are provided in figs a 4 a 8 and tables a 2 a 3 of appendix a under rcp 8 5 the ensemble average annual exceedance probabilities of the inflow and hydropower generation of the tgr are presented in fig 4 nominal decreases in mai and mahg are noted for the near and far future time periods mai is estimated to reduce by 2 0 and 4 5 while mahg is projected to decrease by 2 2 and 5 1 respectively larger reductions in the projected future mahgs could be because of the fact that the tgr cannot take full use of peak inflows during the flood season for hydropower generation since its operation is governed by the sop for flood control from fig 4 the future annual inflows and hydropower generations show overall decreases at almost all exceedance probabilities with respect to the historical period these reductions are appreciable at middle and high exceedance probabilities and reduce progressively as exceedance probability decreases the exceedance probability patterns of annual hydropower generations across the historical and future time periods closely follow those of annual inflows indicating that the projected changes in the hydropower generation of the tgr come mainly from those in the reservoir inflow fig 5 presents the mean monthly percentage changes in the inflow and hydropower generation of the tgr under rcp 8 5 a consistent decrease throughout most of the year can be seen in the future ensemble average simulations of mean monthly inflow fig 5a and b the inconsistency in the projected changes of the mean monthly inflows and climate variables fig a 2 suggests that the changes in inflow not only primarily relate to the precipitation changes but also to the changes in temperature which affects snowmelt and evapotranspiration to access ensemble average changes in the mean monthly hydropower generation we mainly focus on the november and may months where the most changes occur fig 5c and d in these two months hydropower generation of the tgr is projected to be reduced by 5 2 13 0 for the future scenarios in the other non flood months nominal changes are projected in the future following the sop the tgr cannot effectively make use of peak flows for hydropower generation during the flood season when the rate of inflow exceeds the maximum flow rate of the turbines therefore notwithstanding decreased inflow the changes of hydropower generation and mflr caused by the inflow decrease is limited likewise the inflow decreases during the refill period although reduces the ffr and delays the mfffd would have limited impact on hydropower generation in this period because of the firm hydropower output requirement during the following period before the end of april the tgr tends to store water for may and keep water level as high as possible hydropower generation is reduced strongly when the water level remains at the normal water level but weakly affected when the water level lies in the firm hydropower output zone decreased hydropower is generated when the water level falls below the lower boundary curve as shown in fig 2 the inflow decreases will cause a significant reduction in the mhgr and the hydropower generation during the drawdown period since the tgr should be emptied before the flood season the ensemble average values for the inflow and hydropower generation metrics of the tgr under rcp 8 5 are given in table 2 the severity and frequency of extreme dry period are projected to have small changes in the future scenarios the tgr is projected to have decreased max and min in the future with the reductions for far future being more prominent than those for near future the decreased mhgr indicates that the tgr will face more severe challenges for the firm hydropower output in the future while the mflr shows negligible changes for the future scenarios indicating limited affects caused by the decreased max finally fig 6 demonstrates the mean water level behavior of the tgr for the two future time periods under the rcp 8 5 scenario the ensemble average lines historical and averaged lines indicate that the mean operating water levels in the non flood season will reduce for the future scenarios the mawlns decreases by 0 5 and 1 6 m respectively for the near and far future time periods with respect to the historical time period special attention is also paid to the metrics ffr and mfffd of the tgr which are sensitive to the reservoir inflow reductions during the refill period it can be seen that for the near and far future scenarios the ffr will have remarkable decreases of 8 8 and 22 6 and the mfffd will be delayed by 1 5 and 3 5 days respectively 5 discussion 5 1 water and energy security in the future response to extreme variations in annual inflow although the effect on annual hydropower generation caused by projected change in annual inflow in wet years is limited the frequency of dry years is projected to increase in the near and far future time periods as indicated by the decreases in the annual inflows corresponding to 90 100 exceedance probabilities leading to water stress on hydropower generation especially the firm hydropower output we focus on extreme variations in annual inflow to assess the water and energy security of the tgr for the future scenarios the wettest and driest variations are determined by first finding the maximum and minimum annual inflows for each rcm and then averaging the corresponding attributes across the 6 rcms for the evaluation period with respect to the historical period the future annual inflow and hydropower generation hydropower generation reliability and full load rate are projected to vary from 6 2 to 2 4 8 1 to 0 3 13 3 to 2 0 and 1 7 to 0 respectively for both the extreme variations fig 7 accordingly the tgr is estimated to have lower average water levels in the non flood season for the future scenarios corresponding to the wettest variation any reduction in peak inflows which exceed the maximum flow rate of the turbines may have no effect on hydropower generation therefore annual inflow reduction cannot guarantee a similar change in annual hydropower generation and full load rate on the other hand since the full load rate is close to zero in both the historical and future time periods for the driest variation annual inflow decrease has a strong positive relationship with the reduction in annual hydropower generation for both the wettest and driest variations the lower average water levels in the non flood season decrease the hydropower generation reliability increasing threats to the water and energy security of the tgr 5 2 comparison between with and without snow projections under subtropical monsoon zone snow accumulation and melt in the winter are significant in approximately 25 of the uyrb and occasional in other portions birkinshaw et al 2017 during the hydrological modeling of the uyrb inflow projections of the tgr are also generated without snow for historical and rcp 8 5 and are presented in fig 8 compared with the projections with snow mean monthly inflow and hydropower generation without snow are projected to increase from october to january which can be ascribed to the seasonal variations of snow accumulation and melt in the uyrb these increases will improve the ffr and advance the mfffd further lead to the increase in the mhgr which is in accordance with the increase in the mawlns however the corresponding changes in mai and mahg are marginal since some mean monthly increases and decreases can cancel each other out comparison between the simulations with and without snow shows that the decreased snow accumulation and increase snow melt caused by increasing temperature have positive effect on the hydropower generation however a previous study has revealed that on average only 2 0 of natural runoff in the uyrb comes from meltwater fang et al 2017 the differences between the projections with and without snow should be nominal especially for future climate warming 5 3 impact of emission scenarios and regional climate models the ensemble average projections of the 6 rcms demonstrate that there will be a decrease in future mean annual precipitation for both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 and the decreases in mai and mahg of the tgr under rcp 4 5 are smaller than those under rcp 8 5 due to the smaller decrease in the mean annual precipitation under rcp 4 5 nevertheless future projections exhibit large spreads across the 6 rcms without agreement in the direction of changes fig 9 among these rcms hadgem3 predicts wetter results with increases in precipitation and inflow in the future the mahg is estimated to increase by 2 7 6 1 in the near future time period and by 8 0 9 0 in the far future time period on the contrary clmhadgem2 shows the largest decreases in future projections where the mahg is estimated to decrease by 6 7 7 3 in the near future time period and by 8 1 13 3 in the far future time period under these two rcms the tgr is predicted to have the highest and lowest mean water levels during the non flood season figs 6 and s6 respectively as indicated above large variations in the future projections are projected by different rcps and rcms in this paper 6 rcms under two rcps can only capture a fraction of the range of possible future climate changes for the uyrb therefore it is important to reveal the mechanisms of inflow and hydropower generation responses to climate change using the obtained projections across all rcms and rcps fig a 9 linear relationships between the projected changes in inflow and hydropower generation with projected changes in precipitation and non linear relationships between the projected changes in inflow and hydropower generation with projected changes in temperature are obtained generally decreased precipitation causes decreased inflow and hydropower generation and increased temperature causes increased evapotranspiration and snowmelt therefore the inflow and hydropower generation responses to precipitation change are simple but those to temperature are more complicated 6 conclusions it is important that major water infrastructure as re assessed to quantify water availability and assess plans for optimal management of water resources for drinking agriculture and hydropower generation in a changing climate in the study we focus on the operation of one of the largest hydropower projects in the world the three gorges reservoir tgr in china with the aim of assessing the impact of climate change on the sustainability of its water and energy future precipitation and temperature projections are extracted from the 6 rcms available under the cordex ea project under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 and then bias corrected for deriving the hydrological modeling of the uyrb reservoir inflows generated with and without snow using the bias corrected precipitation and temperatures are used to simulate the daily operation of the tgr for both the historical 1960 2005 and future near 2021 2050 and far 2061 2090 time periods the ensemble average projections by averaging the relevant attributes across the 6 rcms on both annual and monthly scales are presented to analyze the climate change impacts on the operation of the tgr the output of the 6 rcms project different future climate changes for both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 the ensemble average statistics of the 6 rcms suggest that there will be a decrease in future mean annual precipitation for these two rcps which is inconsistent with the findings of the most of the previous studies tian et al 2015 piao et al 2010 tao et al 2012 chen and frauenfeld 2014 lee et al 2014 these differences may be attributed to different climate data sources models and bias correction approach used mean annual inflow and hydropower generation of the tgr are projected to have small decreases for both the near and far futures under rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 changes in hydropower generations are strongly related to the variations in inflows however are also influenced by the installed capacity of the tgr and the operating rule curves in place at monthly time scale changes in reservoir inflows have different impact on the magnitude of hydropower generation changes because of the varying designed operating rule curves for different months with these rules hydropower generation of the tgr is less sensitive to the inflow changes during the flood season from june to september and has obviously different responses for months in the non flood season from october to may the inflow decreases strongly reduce the hydropower generation of the tgr in november and may and have limited impact on other months the extreme variations in annual inflow are projected to aggravate the water and energy security stress of the tgr by reducing the hydropower generation reliability in addition the without snow projections alter the inflow patterns as well as the hydropower generation patterns of the tgr with respect to the with snow projections and the nominal inflow increases from october to january are likely to have positive impact on the waterimpounding and hydropower generation for both the historical and future time periods our results might carry the limitations of the hydrologic and bias correction models used the hec hms u s army corps of engineers 2018 hydrologic model is used in the research this model has got an extensive database of model parameters and has been studied extensively hong and adler 2008 song et al 2011 kure et al 2013 meenu et al 2013 halwatura and najim 2013 birkinshaw et al 2017 the bias correction model is used is a multivariate multisite model and has been shown to perform well mehrotra and sharma 2019 the results of this paper demonstrate the operation of the tgr with the standard operating rule curves under the projected and assumed future climate changes further studies should be conducted on developing and using the adaptive operating rules for the tgr zhang et al 2017a yang et al 2016 these rules will guide the tgr to adapt better to the possible future climate changes which is valuable for the management of the reservoir credit authorship contribution statement hu hu conceptualization data curation formal analysis methodology
