technology no 13 yanta road xi an 710055 china graphical abstract simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd in a model distribution pipe dp fed with actual reclaimed water was studied in this experiment the water quality microbial activity bacteria community as well as the surfaces of biofilm were analysed and observed along the model dp which had been operated for more than three years the results exhibited that the nitrogen loss appeared in 65 6 of the samples and an observable increase in ph value and a measurable decrease in organic carbon occurred along the flow course the highest nitrification activity arose at the forepart of dp which indicated nitrifiers of biofilm in dp appeared low susceptible to residual chlorine meanwhile the higher denitrification activity was inclined to appear in the middle section of dp and the obvious gas pores existed on the biofilm surfaces of dp finally the clone analysis revealed that nitrospirae and nitrosomonadales were the dominant nitrifiers while some potential denitrifiers such as pseudomonas flavobacteria sphingobacteria and acinetobacter were also detected along the model dp briefly snd could happen in the dp fed with the reclaimed water even under a certain amount of residual chlorine existed in the influent a complicated microbial community including typical nitrifiers and denitrifiers was involved in the biofilm system of the dp which played a key role in snd the paper revealed that the end water quality tended to stable after a long delivery for reclaimed water due to snd which is helpful to the designers and managers of the water resource keywords snd reclaimed water distribution pipe biofilm microbial community 1 introduction china is among the 13 countries in the world with the lowest water availability and the per capita water availability of china is about a quarter of the world average moreover a majority of the available water is concentrated on the south leaving the northern and western china to experience perpetual droughts 1 to alleviate the water resource crisis in china wastewater reclamation and reuse have drawn increasing attention as integral components of water resource management 2 reclaimed water has widely used in northwestern china since water scarcity is becoming increasingly severe for example xi an located in northwestern china had begun conveying and utilizing reclaimed wastewater in industrial cooling systems to alleviate water shortage from 2002 3 moreover some landscape lakes in urban districts of xi an are also replenished with reclaimed water according to the wastewater reclamation and reuse plan during the twelfth five year period 2011 2015 of xi an 4 given that the scenic water is scattered across the entire city the necessary pipeline networks for reclaimed water distribution approximately 55 km have been finished and some other pipeline will be constructed in the future however little attention has been paid to the effect of long delivery on the reclaimed water quality the quality standard of reclaimed water is different for different customers however a relatively higher concentration of nitrogen including ammonia nitrate and nitrite and organic carbon are allowed in most reclaimed water when compared with that in drinking water 5 on the other side the production of reclaimed water is based on the effluent of wastewater which is normally experienced a series of biological process such as nitrification denitrification and so on and involved in unavoidably various nitrifiers and denitrifiers 6 generally speaking bacteria can enter a physiological state called persistence in which lethal antibiotics do not kill them 7 persistence is a phenotype expressed by almost all bacteria and the bacteria have the characteristics of persistence are called persisters 8 persisters which constitute a small proportion typically less than 1 of bacterial populations are naturally insensitive tolerant to multiple antibiotics despite having the same genotype as the sensitive majority 9 10 in this context the persisters among nitrifiers and denitrifiers coming from the upstream wastewater system will unavoidably enter the distribution pipe of reclaimed water although the disinfection processes are carried out routinely in the final process of wastewater treatment and reclaimed water production respectively 11 in addition a certain quantity of oxygen is dissolved necessarily in the finished reclaimed water tank because most of the purifying processes are implemented under aerobic environment nevertheless the reclaimed water would further undergo oxygen deficit process in the long distance pipeline where the reclaimed water is delivered by pressure 12 the phenomenon of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd is referred to these two biological processes occurring simultaneously in the same reactor snd has attracted considerable attention in wastewater treatment system by many researchers because of its advantages of smaller reaction volume shorter reaction time and lower energy consumption 13 14 however the knowledge on snd in distribution pipes is very limited at present the reason lies in that higher concentration of organic matter limited nitrification in sewer distribution pipes while lower concentration of organic matter limited denitrification in water distribution pipes 15 as for the reclaimed water distribution pipe dp it would be a definitely different scene where a certain concentration of nitrogen and carbon some possible persisters of nitrifier and denitrifier and the aerobic anoxic micro environment could co exist together theoretically the occurrence possibility of snd in a reclaimed water distribution pipe is very large 16 17 on the other side to meet water quality standard of scenic reuse many efforts have been made in china to reduce the residual nitrogen and organic carbon in the treated wastewater although the residual nitrogen and organic carbon have been very low for the treatment craft in the wastewater treatment and reuse company extra carbon is sometimes needed to complete nitrate removal through denitrification and extra aeration is needed to remove ammonia and the leftover carbon so if the snd could occur in the reclaimed water distribution pipe dp some carbon source and energy source can be saved in the wastewater treatment and reuse company and the water quality of end user still can be guaranteed this has important significance to the designers and managers of the wastewater treatment and reuse company however to our knowledge no studies have examined the snd process in the reclaimed water distribution pipe so far due to the difficulty of sampling and detecting in the actual dp or the infrequent application of long delivery of reclaimed water in this experiment a series of special reactors to simulate a distribution pipe dp was adopted and fed with the actual effluent of a wastewater treatment and reuse company to prove the snd process occurring in the model reclaimed water dp moreover the community structure of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria existed in the biofilm of the model reclaimed water dp was confirmed and characterized through the clone analysis of the biofilm along the model reclaimed water dp the main objective of this study is to provide a predicable change of water quality after a long delivery of reclaimed water which not only supplies an exact evidence to snd process occurring in the reclaimed water dp but has important significance to the designers and managers of the wastewater treatment and reuse company 2 materials and methods 2 1 reclaimed water source and water quality reclaimed water used in this experiment was from qingyuan wastewater treatment and reuse company qwtrc of xi an china the source of reclaimed water was the secondary effluent of a double oxidation ditch municipal wastewater treatment plant the process of qwtrc involves coagulation sedimentation sand filtration disinfection to produce reclaimed water sodium hypochlorite with a dosage of 50 mg l 1 was utilized as a disinfectant which guaranteed the chlorine residue concentration above 0 05 mg l 1 for the end user the influent in this experiment was obtained from a finished water tank of qwtrc where the hydraulic retention time hrt was kept at approximately 2 h after disinfection the main parameters of the reclaimed water utilized in the experiment were showed in table 1 2 2 model distribution pipe dp the model dp was set up in an open field at qwtrc of xi an china cdc biofilm reactors model cbr 90 1 cdc biosurface technologies bozeman mt usa were utilized for this experiment as described previously 18 an ultrahigh molecular mass polyethylene top supported by eight independent and removable polyethylene rods was also used each rod held four removable polyvinyl chloride coupons which were utilized to support biofilm growth and had an exposed surface area of 2 53 cm2 the glass vessels were placed on a magnetic stirring apparatus that can provide constant rotation via the baffled stir bar at a designated speed of 170 rpm which can also provide the coupon surface a consistent shear as that in an actual water dp each cdc reactor can provide approximately 600 ml operational fluid capacity and render a residence time of 15 min by controlling the peristaltic pump four cdc biofilm reactors were assembled together fig a in the supplementary materials to model the plug fluid flow in the dp 2 3 sample and analysis of the reclaimed water samples of reclaimed water in the model dp were collected for more than three years five sites namely the finished water tank and the outlets of each reactor r1 r2 r3 and r4 were sampled different sampling points represented various flow times or hydraulic retention times hrt in the reactors or the model pipe the five samples were obtained in sequence from the finished water tank to r4 to model the reclaimed water flow through the distribution pipe the samples were collected every 10 days approximately except for the spring festival holiday of each year the collected samples were stored in an icy container and transported to the key laboratory of the chinese ministry of education for analysis in two hours residual and total chlorine were determined with a hanna hi96734 instrument and ph values were measured with a ph meter phs 3c measurement accuracy 1 dissolved oxygen do and temperature were measured with a hach portable multifunctional water quality meter hq 30d these parameters were analyzed in the field immediately ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n phosphate po4 3 p alkalinity alk hardness and sulfate so4 2 were measured according to standard methods dissolved organic carbon doc was measured with an lcpn toc meter shimadzu japan these parameters were analyzed in the key laboratory of the chinese ministry of education biodegradable dissolved organic carbon bdoc was monitored through the suspended inoculums method the water samples 500 ml were inoculated with indigenous bacteria and incubated for 28 d at 20 bdoc concentration was determined as the difference between the initial doc concentration and the last doc concentration observed during the incubation period 2 4 sample and analysis of the biofilm 2 4 1 sampling and observation of the biofilm formed in the model dp the biofilms in this study were cultivated in four cdc reactors fed with reclaimed water biofilm coupons were obtained directly from each reactor for observation through scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 6510lv jeol ltd japan before observation the biofilms with coupons were pretreated with 4 paraformaldehyde solutions for fixation and then dehydrated with a series of graded ethanol solutions 2 4 2 nitrification and denitrification activity of biofilms formed in the model dp the nitrification and denitrification activity of the biofilm in the reclaimed water dp were measured at the end of the experiment the nitrification activity of biofilm in the reclaimed water dp was expressed by ammonia uptake rate aur and nitrite uptake rate nur the aur and nur of the biofilm in each cdc reactor were determined by batch experiment via measuring the consumption of nh4 n and no2 n in specific duration respectively the denitrification activities of the biofilm in each cdc reactor were determined through a batch experiment by measuring the consumption of no3 n and no2 n by the biofilm in a specific duration the batch experiment was conducted in four cdc reactors at 25 the nitrification medium which mainly includes ammonia or nitrite was utilized as the nitrogen source the mineral medium used for aob contained 80 mg l 1 nh4cl 240 mg l 1 nahco3 and 2100 mg l 1 naclo3 and the mineral medium used for nob contained 100 mg l 1 nano2 240 mg l 1 nahco3 and 50 mg l 1 allyl thiourea atu the denitrification medium which mainly includes nitrate or nitrite was utilized as the nitrogen source the medium that mainly includes nitrate contained the following per liter nano3 91 07 mg kh2po4 100 mg naac 176 47 mg nh4cl 7 64 mg mgso4 7h2o 40 mg and 1 ml of a trace element solution the medium that mainly includes nitrite was the same as the former except that 91 07 mg nano3 was substituted for 24 64 mg nano2 per liter the trace element solution contained the following per liter na2edta 4292 mg fecl2 4h2o 1988 mg mncl2 h2o 99 mg nicl2 6h2o 24 mg cocl 6h2o 24 mg cucl2 2h2o 17 mg na2mno4 2h2o 24 mg zncl2 68 mg and h3bo4 62 mg during the batch experiment for nitrification measurement the samples for the nh4 n and no2 n analyses were extracted every 5 min from the reactors the experiment lasted 1 h nitrification rates were calculated for aob from the reduction of nh4 n concentration and for nob from the reduction of no2 n concentration per m2 biofilm in an hour and for denitrification measurement the samples for no3 n were obtained every 1 h for 8 h the samples for no2 n were obtained every half hour for 2 h denitrification rates were calculated based on the reduction in no3 n and no2 n concentration per m2 biofilm in a specific period 2 5 polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis pcr dgge of the biofilm formed in the model dp 2 5 1 dna extraction to compare the difference in bacterial communities in each reactor biofilm samples were collected at the end of the experiment the mature biofilm that formed on approximately 5 cm2 of the coupons in the different reactors were scraped out into 10 ml sterile water with an aseptic scraper the biofilm suspensions were centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min and then dna was isolated with the help of a dna isolation kit fast dna spin kit for soil sangon biotech sk8233 according to the manufacturer s instructions 2 5 2 pcr amplification bacterial 16s rrna genes were amplified by using 357 f gc clamp 5 cgcccgccgcgccccgcgcccggcccgccgcccccgcccccctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 534r 5 attaccgcggctgctgg 3 primers targeting the v3 hypervariable regions of the bacterial 16s rrna gene the thermal cycling conditions

gel electrophoresis 2 5 3 dgge analysis for the dgge analysis the polyacrylamide 8 was used to cast a gel with denaturant gradients ranging from 30 to 60 electrophoresis was implemented in a 1 tae buffer solution at 60 v and 60 c for 16 h gels were stained with ethidium bromide solution for 30 min and documented with a uvi image analyzer selected bands were excised from the gel and the pcr product was purified after reamplification using identical primers 357 f and 534r without the gc clamp 2 5 4 cloning and statistical analysis the pcr products were cloned by means of pmd 18 t vector takara biotechnology dalian co ltd following the manufacturer s recommendations the primers utilized for the amplification were m13 f 5 gtaaaacgacggcag and m13r 5 caggaaacagctatac the pcr products were sequenced and the obtained sequences were aligned with the closest 16s rrna sequences available at the genbank database of the national center for biotechnology information ncbi sequences with more than 93 taxonomic homology were selected for subsequent analysis the shannon wiener index was employed to present the microbial diversity of the biofilm samples the intensity information of the individual dgge bands was analyzed with quantity one 2 6 statistical analysis the experimental data were statistically analyzed calculated and plotted using origin 9 0 software the average value standard deviation and variance of the data were analyzed using spss software pasw statistics 20 0 the variance of inorganic nitrogen concentration organic carbon concentration and ph value was based on the data of 3 years 3 results 3 1 the change of reclaimed water quality along the model dp 3 1 1 change of inorganic nitrogen and ph value in reclaimed water fig 1 a shows the change in inorganic nitrogen concentration in the model dp during the whole experiment as fig 1 a showed that the average nh4 n concentration was 4 49 mg l 1 in the influent and 1 11 mg l 1 in the effluent of r4 the no3 n concentration clearly increased from 3 13 mg l 1 in the influent to 7 14 mg l 1 in the effluent of r4 however no2 n concentration decreased from 1 34 mg l 1 in the influent to 0 49 mg l 1 at the outlet of r4 the variance in inorganic nitrogen concentration indicated that an obvious nitrification occurred in the model dp fig 1 b exhibits that the ph value appeared increasing trend along the flow course as it was known nitrification produced almost two strong acid equivalents per mole of nh4 removed which would lower the ph value normally so the variation of ph value along the flow course indicated that nitrification may be not the only biochemical process occurred in the model dp to investigate this apparent contradiction a calculation of nitrogen balance in the reclaimed water of model dp was carried out the statistical result exhibited that the obvious loss of nitrogen accounted for 65 6 in the total samples under the fluctuated concentration of influent nitrogen in the model dp this result indicated that the nitrogen concentration in the reclaimed water model dp was decreased along the flow course considering the phenomenon of increased ph value along the flow course it was supposed that denitrification may occur in somewhere of the biofilm in the reclaimed water model dp it made sense that the model system had been operating for more than three years in continuous flow mode thereby allowing microorganisms in reclaimed water to colonize and settle on the surfaces of the coupons and forming a mature biofilm the mature biofilm could provide protection for several denitrifiers which can transform no3 n or no2 n to n2 under appropriate conditions e g available electron donor 3 1 2 change of organic carbon in reclaimed water along the model dp doc and bdoc are important parameters to describe the concentration of organic carbon in reclaimed water fig 2 shows the concentration variations of doc and bdoc along the flow course in the model dp the average concentration of doc was slightly low in the influent and increased in the first reactor r1 soon afterward it decreased gradually along the flow course the bdoc concentration decreased from the influent to the last reactor r4 step by step the bdoc concentration in the current experiment ranged from 0 81 mg l 1 to 1 66 mg l 1 the relatively high concentration of bdoc provided the possible electron donor available for denitrification the general trend of doc and bdoc concentrations in the model dp indicated that organic carbon was consumed gradually although the amount of both was tiny the loss of nitrogen the increase in ph value and the decrease in organic carbon concentration along the flow course showed that denitrification did occur in the model dp 3 2 nitrification and denitrification activity of biofilm along the model dp 3 2 1 nitrification activity of the biofilm to demonstrate the difference of nitrification along the model distribution pipe fed with reclaimed water nitrification rates of biofilm in each reactor described by aur and nur were measured and showed in fig 3 it revealed that the aur and nur of biofilm in each cdc reactor varied largely the aur reduced from 11 52 to 4 17 mg nh4 n m2 biofilm h and the nur was decreased from 13 16 to 1 54 mg no2 n m2 biofilm h from the r1 to the r4 moreover the aur and nur of biofilm in r1 were much higher than those in other reactors and the nitrification rate was followed as r1 r2 r3 r4 as shown in table 1 a certain amount of residual chlorine existed in the influent of reclaimed water which could cause a suppression of biofilm activity by inhibiting microorganisms at the inlet of the dp however the nitrification activity in r1 was unexpectedly the highest which implied that the nitrifiers in the reclaimed water had a good resistance to the disinfectant under good nutrient condition 3 2 2 denitrification activity of the biofilm to demonstrate the difference in denitrification in the model dp the denitrification rates of the biofilm in each reactor were measured based on the medium of nitrate and nitrite as shown in fig 4 the denitrification rates of the biofilm in each cdc reactor varied significantly and with different changing trends generally the transformation rate of no2 was slower than that of no3 for biofilm in the same reactor when nitrate was utilized as the nitrogen source the denitrification rate gradually increased from 5 18 mg no3 n g biofilm h in r1 to 9 45 mg no3 n g biofilm h in r3 and then declined to 4 74 mg no3 n g biofilm h in r4 when nitrite was utilized as the nitrogen source the denitrification rate increased from 1 45 mg no2 n g biofilm h in r1 to 2 81 mg no2 n g biofilm h in r2 and then gradually declined to 1 47 mg no2 n g biofilm h in r4 the change of the biofilm exhibited a higher denitrification rate with nitrate as the nitrogen source could be attributed to the fact that no3 n concentration was always higher than no2 n concentration in the reclaimed water model dp while the nitrite was the only intermediate product of nitrification and denitrification and kept a lower concentration in the model dp thus the denitrification rate of the biofilm in r3 was much higher than those of the others when nitrate was employed as the nitrogen source with an ordinal rank of observed denitrification rate r3 r2 r1 r4 however the observed denitrification rate of the biofilm in r2 was much higher than those of the others when nitrite was employed as the nitrogen source with an ordinal rank of r2 r3 r1 r4 the shift in biofilm denitrification rate had a strong relationship with the change of water quality along the flow course in this experiment as mentioned above a certain amount of residual chlorine and low concentration of do existed in the influent of reclaimed water which could cause an inhibition on denitrifier activity in biofilm at the inlet of the dp in addition the high concentration of ammonium in the influent provided the substrate for nitrification which subsequently became the substrate for denitrification in the succeeding reactors under the condition of a certain amount of doc as for r4 the concentrations of no3 n no2 n and bdoc were unavoidably the lowest one among the four reactors which made the biofilm lowest activity of nitrification and denitrification in general the evident denitrification activity could be observed in the model dp and the denitrification rates of biofilm in r2 and r3 were higher than those in r1 and r4 which might be attributed to the concentration gradient of residual chlorine and bdoc as well as the wettability difference of nanochannels in the biofilm surfaces along the flow course 19 3 3 sem of the biofilm surfaces fig 5 shows the sem image of the micro pore on the biofilm surface in the different reactors of the reclaimed water model dp as shown in fig 5 different characteristic voids were observed on the biofilm formed in different reactors the biofilm surfaces of r2 r3 and r4 had gas pores similar to the denitrification pores according to the size of the hole while no obvious gas pores occurred on the biofilm surface of r1 it made sense that the gas pores existed in the biofilm of r2 which was observed the maximum denitrification rate according to nitrite as for the biofilm in r3 only few gas pores appeared on its surface where the dominant process of denitrification was to transform no3 to no2 however it seemed that it was hard to understand the homogeneous gas pores approximately 1 μm on the biofilm of r4 because both the denitrification rates according to nitrate and nitrite were the minimum for the biofilm of r4 anyway the observable gas pores on the biofilm surface of model dp appeared here and there the reason why the pores on the biofilm surface were significantly different in abundance and size may be attributed to the existence of different microorganisms as well as the different quantities of nitrogenous gas released 3 4 microbial community 3 4 1 clone analysis clone analysis was conducted for the four cdc biofilm reactors after more than three years of the experiment sixty five different dgge bands were detected in all the samples among them 36 representative dgge bands were excised and sequenced altogether more than eight bacterial phyla were recovered from the samples relative abundance of each bacteria was calculated with the relative intensities of the sequences affiliated with different phyla to the total number of sequences which was regarded as the relative proportion of each phylum in each band the bacterial community of the influent and four biofilm samples in phylum and level were presented in fig 6 fig 6 shows that acidobacteria appeared in all the samples and dominated the influent and the biofilm of r1 accounting for 33 58 and 38 11 of the clones respectively both bacteroidetes and nitrospirae were abundant in all the biofilm samples but were scarce in the influent firmicutes bacterial group tested in all the samples except for the biofilm of r1 accounted for 20 79 and 30 95 in the biofilms of r2 and r3 respectively chloroflexi only occurred in the biofilm of r4 and was absent in the other samples of the model dp in addition alphaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria also existed in the model dp however an obvious difference in the proteobacteria phylum was observed along the flow course alphaproteobacteria was present in all sample sites along the flow course although the abundance was uneven the abundance of betaproteobacteria was generally low and absent in the biofilm of r4 gammaproteobacteria appeared a high abundance in influent but disappeared along most of the model dp and presented a little in r4 at the order level sphingomonadales affiliated with alphaproteobacteria burkholderiales and nitrosomonadales affiliated with betaproteobacteria and pseudomonadales affiliated with gammaproteobacteria were predominant in the biofilm samples however flavobacterium sphingomonas and pseudomonas were found in all the samples but at different relative abundance at the genera level in general nitrospirae were abundant in all biofilm samples and the percentages of nitrospirae in samples of r1 r2 r3 and r4 13 3 11 8 12 2 and 13 0 respectively were obviously higher than that in sample of the influent 2 5 in addition nitrosomonadales affiliated with betaproteobacteria were also detected in most of the biofilm samples r1 r2 and r3 on the other side pseudomonas flavobacteria sphingobacteria and acinetobacter were detected in the influent and biofilms of the model dp these bacterial genera detected in the biofilm of model dp provided the basis of microbial community for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification in reclaimed water delivery 3 4 2 diversity analysis the shannon wiener index of diversity was calculated for the different communities based on the species affiliation of the clone sequences the diversity indices of the different sampling sites were shown in table 2 the values of the shannon wiener index in r2 and r4 were very close and both of them had a relatively high level of bacterial diversity the bacterial diversity in the biofilm of the model dp except for r1 was higher than that of the influent this phenomenon may be due to the high concentration of disinfectant in the finished tank of reclaimed water which hindered microorganism growth at the front of the model dp 4 discussion simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd has received considerable attention in wastewater treatment system but the knowledge of snd in dp is very rare at present the results obtained from this study suggested that snd did occur in a model dp fed with disinfected reclaimed water 4 1 co exist of nitrifier and denitrifier in the biofilm of dp fed with reclaimed water in this study nitrospirae were found abundant in all biofilm samples of model dp although a lower percentage occurred in the influent 2 5 meanwhile nitrosomonadales affiliated with betaproteobacteria were also detected in most of the biofilm samples some researchers found that nitrospira was the dominant bacteria related to colonize the surfaces comprising a majority of the biofilm cells 20 it was also the dominant nitrifier of the biofilm in the model dp of reclaimed water reported in our previous work 18 nitrosomonas spp and nitrosospira spp affiliated with betaproteobacteria constituted a fraction of the aob in drinking water distribution systems as well as nitrospira spp and nitrobacter spp belonging to nob were also reported in biofilms of the drinking water distribution system 21 24 the current research demonstrated that the species of nitrifiers in the reclaimed water dp were similar to that in the drinking water distribution system and the nitrifiers in the reclaimed water had an excellent adaptation to the disinfectant under better nutrient condition compared with drinking water recent molecular techniques has also provided valuable insights into the structure and function of wastewater denitrification communities 25 26 undoubtedly the reclaimed water delivered in the model dp was from the effluent of wastewater treatment plant in the present experiment therefore it was not unexpected that the denitrifiers existed in the influent and biofilm of the model dp however it is difficult to elucidate the community composition of denitrifiers by molecular methods because denitrifying bacteria exhibit high taxonomic diversity in our work pseudomonas flavobacteria sphingobacteria and acinetobacter were detected in the influent and biofilms of the model dp pseudomonas was the major genus of gammaproteobacteria in the biofilm samples associated with denitrification as well as frequently reported to be capable of denitrification in most wastewater treatment plant and lab scale systems previous studies had observed pseudomonas aeruginosa with high concentrations in automatic faucets 27 28 other researchers had also reported that flavobacteria and sphingobacteria in biofilms had the capability for hydrogenotrophic denitrifying 29 30 meanwhile bacteria belonging to the genera acinetobacter dominated in hydrogen oxidizing microbial cultures 31 therefore part of the potential denitrifiers detected in the current study belonged to hydrogen oxidizing denitrifiers one of the autotrophic denitrifications while the other partial microorganisms probably participated in heterotrophic denitrification many studies have shown that nitrifiers and denitrifiers can co exist in a biofilm system where the denitrifiers are located at the bottom layer and the nitrifiers are located on the surface 32 33 being the intermediate or resultant product of the denitrification process no2 n2o and final n2 gas could be accumulated in the deeper layer of the biofilm these gases eventually erupt through the biofilm and form denitrification pores on the biofilm surface for gas release when the inner pressure is sufficiently high 34 this study exhibited the denitrification gas pores formed on the biofilm surface of model dp and found the remarkable gas pores mainly occurred on the biofilm surface of r2 and r4 however whether or not autotrophic denitrification functioned in r4 still need further proof in the future in brief nitrospirae and nitrosomonadales mainly responsible for nitrification were detected in most of the biofilm samples along the model dp meanwhile pseudomonas flavobacteria sphingobacteria and acinetobacter potentially capable of denitrification were also detected in the influent and biofilms of the model dp the co existence of nitrifiers and denitrifiers in the model dp biofilm of reclaimed water led to the occurrence of snd and the presence of denitrification gas pores the denitrification gas pores along the model dp varied from different denitrification processes totally depending on different elector donors available although the gas pores were similar apparently in this study part of the gas pores may origin from the autotrophic denitrification but most of the gas pores were probably due to the participation of heterotrophic denitrifiers anyway snd did happen in the model dp of reclaimed water to our knowledge this is the first report about snd in the dp of reclaimed water at present and there is more work to investigate further 4 2 effect of snd in the dp on the end water quality of reclaimed water there is no doubt that nitrification could convert nh4 n into no2 n or no3 n which would be converted further into no2 n2o and final n2 gas through denitrification process in the reclaimed water thus snd expectedly led the concentration of ammonia and total nitrogen to decrease in the end water of the dp meanwhile the organic carbon is necessary to complete the heterotrophic denitrification given that the quality standard for reclaimed water allows for a small quantity of organic substrates e g biological oxygen demand in reclaimed water was restricted to below 6 mg l 1 for scenic environment use in china some residual organic carbon unavoidably exists in reclaimed water and can be used for heterotrophic denitrifiers 35 in this experiment there was little increase in doc concentration of r1 and then decreased during water transmission through the model dp the increase of doc concentration in r1 may be attributed to the disinfection of reclaimed water by which the natural organic material dissolved in water can be oxidized by disinfectants e g clo2 cl2 to produce another fraction of doc for heterotrophic bacteria 36 37 on the other side bdoc concentration was decreased along the model dp step by step which led to a lower concentration of bdoc in the water of end reactor r4 compared with the finished reclaimed water in the plant it was evident the denitrification rate of biofilm in r2 and r3 was higher than that in r1 and r4 fig 3 which might be ascribed to readily available carbon existing in r2 and r3 since the measurable disinfectants presented in r1 so the denitrification rate of biofilm in dp of reclaimed water depended on the available carbon concentration however the homogeneous and obvious gas pores appeared not only on the biofilm surface of r2 but on the biofilm surface of r4 which indicated some autotrophic denitrification might appear in r4 as the analysis of bacterial community mentioned in brief snd in the dp fed with reclaimed water would cause the concentrations of ammonia total nitrogen doc and bdoc reduced the decreased concentrations of doc and bdoc implied a stable water quality for the end users compared with the finished water in the plant so snd in the dp fed with reclaimed water is benefit for the end water quality of the reclaimed water 5 conclusion simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd could happen in a distribution pipe dp fed with the reclaimed water even under a certain amount of residual chlorine existed in the influent snd would cause nitrogen loss ph value increase and organic carbon decrease after a long delivery a complicated microbial community including typical nitrifiers and denitrifiers was involved in the biofilm system of model dp which played a key role in snd nitrifiers of biofilm in dp appeared low susceptible to residual chlorine thereby leading to strong nitrification activity at the forepart of the dp the above conclusion revealed that the end water quality tended to stable after a long delivery for reclaimed water due to snd which may provide valuable reference and guidance to the designers and managers of the water resource declaration of competing interest the authors do not have any possible

technology no 13 yanta road xi an 710055 china graphical abstract simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd in a model distribution pipe dp fed with actual reclaimed water was studied in this experiment the water quality microbial activity bacteria community as well as the surfaces of biofilm were analysed and observed along the model dp which had been operated for more than three years the results exhibited that the nitrogen loss appeared in 65 6 of the samples and an observable increase in ph value and a measurable decrease in organic carbon occurred along the flow course the highest nitrification activity arose at the forepart of dp which indicated nitrifiers of biofilm in dp appeared low susceptible to residual chlorine meanwhile the higher denitrification activity was inclined to appear in the middle section of dp and the obvious gas pores existed on the biofilm surfaces of dp finally the clone analysis revealed that nitrospirae and nitrosomonadales were the dominant nitrifiers while some potential denitrifiers such as pseudomonas flavobacteria sphingobacteria and acinetobacter were also detected along the model dp briefly snd could happen in the dp fed with the reclaimed water even under a certain amount of residual chlorine existed in the influent a complicated microbial community including typical nitrifiers and denitrifiers was involved in the biofilm system of the dp which played a key role in snd the paper revealed that the end water quality tended to stable after a long delivery for reclaimed water due to snd which is helpful to the designers and managers of the water resource keywords snd reclaimed water distribution pipe biofilm microbial community 1 introduction china is among the 13 countries in the world with the lowest water availability and the per capita water availability of china is about a quarter of the world average moreover a majority of the available water is concentrated on the south leaving the northern and western china to experience perpetual droughts 1 to alleviate the water resource crisis in china wastewater reclamation and reuse have drawn increasing attention as integral components of water resource management 2 reclaimed water has widely used in northwestern china since water scarcity is becoming increasingly severe for example xi an located in northwestern china had begun conveying and utilizing reclaimed wastewater in industrial cooling systems to alleviate water shortage from 2002 3 moreover some landscape lakes in urban districts of xi an are also replenished with reclaimed water according to the wastewater reclamation and reuse plan during the twelfth five year period 2011 2015 of xi an 4 given that the scenic water is scattered across the entire city the necessary pipeline networks for reclaimed water distribution approximately 55 km have been finished and some other pipeline will be constructed in the future however little attention has been paid to the effect of long delivery on the reclaimed water quality the quality standard of reclaimed water is different for different customers however a relatively higher concentration of nitrogen including ammonia nitrate and nitrite and organic carbon are allowed in most reclaimed water when compared with that in drinking water 5 on the other side the production of reclaimed water is based on the effluent of wastewater which is normally experienced a series of biological process such as nitrification denitrification and so on and involved in unavoidably various nitrifiers and denitrifiers 6 generally speaking bacteria can enter a physiological state called persistence in which lethal antibiotics do not kill them 7 persistence is a phenotype expressed by almost all bacteria and the bacteria have the characteristics of persistence are called persisters 8 persisters which constitute a small proportion typically less than 1 of bacterial populations are naturally insensitive tolerant to multiple antibiotics despite having the same genotype as the sensitive majority 9 10 in this context the persisters among nitrifiers and denitrifiers coming from the upstream wastewater system will unavoidably enter the distribution pipe of reclaimed water although the disinfection processes are carried out routinely in the final process of wastewater treatment and reclaimed water production respectively 11 in addition a certain quantity of oxygen is dissolved necessarily in the finished reclaimed water tank because most of the purifying processes are implemented under aerobic environment nevertheless the reclaimed water would further undergo oxygen deficit process in the long distance pipeline where the reclaimed water is delivered by pressure 12 the phenomenon of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd is referred to these two biological processes occurring simultaneously in the same reactor snd has attracted considerable attention in wastewater treatment system by many researchers because of its advantages of smaller reaction volume shorter reaction time and lower energy consumption 13 14 however the knowledge on snd in distribution pipes is very limited at present the reason lies in that higher concentration of organic matter limited nitrification in sewer distribution pipes while lower concentration of organic matter limited denitrification in water distribution pipes 15 as for the reclaimed water distribution pipe dp it would be a definitely different scene where a certain concentration of nitrogen and carbon some possible persisters of nitrifier and denitrifier and the aerobic anoxic micro environment could co exist together theoretically the occurrence possibility of snd in a reclaimed water distribution pipe is very large 16 17 on the other side to meet water quality standard of scenic reuse many efforts have been made in china to reduce the residual nitrogen and organic carbon in the treated wastewater although the residual nitrogen and organic carbon have been very low for the treatment craft in the wastewater treatment and reuse company extra carbon is sometimes needed to complete nitrate removal through denitrification and extra aeration is needed to remove ammonia and the leftover carbon so if the snd could occur in the reclaimed water distribution pipe dp some carbon source and energy source can be saved in the wastewater treatment and reuse company and the water quality of end user still can be guaranteed this has important significance to the designers and managers of the wastewater treatment and reuse company however to our knowledge no studies have examined the snd process in the reclaimed water distribution pipe so far due to the difficulty of sampling and detecting in the actual dp or the infrequent application of long delivery of reclaimed water in this experiment a series of special reactors to simulate a distribution pipe dp was adopted and fed with the actual effluent of a wastewater treatment and reuse company to prove the snd process occurring in the model reclaimed water dp moreover the community structure of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria existed in the biofilm of the model reclaimed water dp was confirmed and characterized through the clone analysis of the biofilm along the model reclaimed water dp the main objective of this study is to provide a predicable change of water quality after a long delivery of reclaimed water which not only supplies an exact evidence to snd process occurring in the reclaimed water dp but has important significance to the designers and managers of the wastewater treatment and reuse company 2 materials and methods 2 1 reclaimed water source and water quality reclaimed water used in this experiment was from qingyuan wastewater treatment and reuse company qwtrc of xi an china the source of reclaimed water was the secondary effluent of a double oxidation ditch municipal wastewater treatment plant the process of qwtrc involves coagulation sedimentation sand filtration disinfection to produce reclaimed water sodium hypochlorite with a dosage of 50 mg l 1 was utilized as a disinfectant which guaranteed the chlorine residue concentration above 0 05 mg l 1 for the end user the influent in this experiment was obtained from a finished water tank of qwtrc where the hydraulic retention time hrt was kept at approximately 2 h after disinfection the main parameters of the reclaimed water utilized in the experiment were showed in table 1 2 2 model distribution pipe dp the model dp was set up in an open field at qwtrc of xi an china cdc biofilm reactors model cbr 90 1 cdc biosurface technologies bozeman mt usa were utilized for this experiment as described previously 18 an ultrahigh molecular mass polyethylene top supported by eight independent and removable polyethylene rods was also used each rod held four removable polyvinyl chloride coupons which were utilized to support biofilm growth and had an exposed surface area of 2 53 cm2 the glass vessels were placed on a magnetic stirring apparatus that can provide constant rotation via the baffled stir bar at a designated speed of 170 rpm which can also provide the coupon surface a consistent shear as that in an actual water dp each cdc reactor can provide approximately 600 ml operational fluid capacity and render a residence time of 15 min by controlling the peristaltic pump four cdc biofilm reactors were assembled together fig a in the supplementary materials to model the plug fluid flow in the dp 2 3 sample and analysis of the reclaimed water samples of reclaimed water in the model dp were collected for more than three years five sites namely the finished water tank and the outlets of each reactor r1 r2 r3 and r4 were sampled different sampling points represented various flow times or hydraulic retention times hrt in the reactors or the model pipe the five samples were obtained in sequence from the finished water tank to r4 to model the reclaimed water flow through the distribution pipe the samples were collected every 10 days approximately except for the spring festival holiday of each year the collected samples were stored in an icy container and transported to the key laboratory of the chinese ministry of education for analysis in two hours residual and total chlorine were determined with a hanna hi96734 instrument and ph values were measured with a ph meter phs 3c measurement accuracy 1 dissolved oxygen do and temperature were measured with a hach portable multifunctional water quality meter

measured according to standard methods dissolved organic carbon doc was measured with an lcpn toc meter shimadzu japan these parameters were analyzed in the key laboratory of the chinese ministry of education biodegradable dissolved organic carbon bdoc was monitored through the suspended inoculums method the water samples 500 ml were inoculated with indigenous bacteria and incubated for 28 d at 20 bdoc concentration was determined as the difference between the initial doc concentration and the last doc concentration observed during the incubation period 2 4 sample and analysis of the biofilm 2 4 1 sampling and observation of the biofilm formed in the model dp the biofilms in this study were cultivated in four cdc reactors fed with reclaimed water biofilm coupons were obtained directly from each reactor for observation through scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 6510lv jeol ltd japan before observation the biofilms with coupons were pretreated with 4 paraformaldehyde solutions for fixation and then dehydrated with a series of graded ethanol solutions 2 4 2 nitrification and denitrification activity of biofilms formed in the model dp the nitrification and denitrification activity of the biofilm in the reclaimed water dp were measured at the end of the experiment the nitrification activity of biofilm in the reclaimed water dp was expressed by ammonia uptake rate aur and nitrite uptake rate nur the aur and nur of the biofilm in each cdc reactor were determined by batch experiment via measuring the consumption of nh4 n and no2 n in specific duration respectively the denitrification activities of the biofilm in each cdc reactor were determined through a batch experiment by measuring the consumption of no3 n and no2 n by the biofilm in a specific duration the batch experiment was conducted in four cdc reactors at 25 the nitrification medium which mainly includes ammonia or nitrite was utilized as the nitrogen source the mineral medium used for aob contained 80 mg l 1 nh4cl 240 mg l 1 nahco3 and 2100 mg l 1 naclo3 and the mineral medium used for nob contained 100 mg l 1 nano2 240 mg l 1 nahco3 and 50 mg l 1 allyl thiourea atu the denitrification medium which mainly includes nitrate or nitrite was utilized as the nitrogen source the medium that mainly includes nitrate contained the following per liter nano3 91 07 mg kh2po4 100 mg naac 176 47 mg nh4cl 7 64 mg mgso4 7h2o 40 mg and 1 ml of a trace element solution the medium that mainly includes nitrite was the same as the former except that 91 07 mg nano3 was substituted for 24 64 mg nano2 per liter the trace element solution contained the following per liter na2edta 4292 mg fecl2 4h2o 1988 mg mncl2 h2o 99 mg nicl2 6h2o 24 mg cocl 6h2o 24 mg cucl2 2h2o 17 mg na2mno4 2h2o 24 mg zncl2 68 mg and h3bo4 62 mg during the batch experiment for nitrification measurement the samples for the nh4 n and no2 n analyses were extracted every 5 min from the reactors the experiment lasted 1 h nitrification rates were calculated for aob from the reduction of nh4 n concentration and for nob from the reduction of no2 n concentration per m2 biofilm in an hour and for denitrification measurement the samples for no3 n were obtained every 1 h for 8 h the samples for no2 n were obtained every half hour for 2 h denitrification rates were calculated based on the reduction in no3 n and no2 n concentration per m2 biofilm in a specific period 2 5 polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis pcr dgge of the biofilm formed in the model dp 2 5 1 dna extraction to compare the difference in bacterial communities in each reactor biofilm samples were collected at the end of the experiment the mature biofilm that formed on approximately 5 cm2 of the coupons in the different reactors were scraped out into 10 ml sterile water with an aseptic scraper the biofilm suspensions were centrifuged at 10 000 g for 10 min and then dna was isolated with the help of a dna isolation kit fast dna spin kit for soil sangon biotech sk8233 according to the manufacturer s instructions 2 5 2 pcr amplification bacterial 16s rrna genes were amplified by using 357 f gc clamp 5 cgcccgccgcgccccgcgcccggcccgccgcccccgcccccctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 534r 5 attaccgcggctgctgg 3 primers targeting the v3 hypervariable regions of the bacterial 16s rrna gene the thermal cycling conditions

gel electrophoresis 2 5 3 dgge analysis for the dgge analysis the polyacrylamide 8 was used to cast a gel with denaturant gradients ranging from 30 to 60 electrophoresis was implemented in a 1 tae buffer solution at 60 v and 60 c for 16 h gels were stained with ethidium bromide solution for 30 min and documented with a uvi image analyzer selected bands were excised from the gel and the pcr product was purified after reamplification using identical primers 357 f and 534r without the gc clamp 2 5 4 cloning and statistical analysis the pcr products were cloned by means of pmd 18 t vector takara biotechnology dalian co ltd following the manufacturer s recommendations the primers utilized for the amplification were m13 f 5 gtaaaacgacggcag and m13r 5 caggaaacagctatac the pcr products were sequenced and the obtained sequences were aligned with the closest 16s rrna sequences available at the genbank database of the national center for biotechnology information ncbi sequences with more than 93 taxonomic homology were selected for subsequent analysis the shannon wiener index was employed to present the microbial diversity of the biofilm samples the intensity information of the individual dgge bands was analyzed with quantity one 2 6 statistical analysis the experimental data were statistically analyzed calculated and plotted using origin 9 0 software the average value standard deviation and variance of the data were analyzed using spss software pasw statistics 20 0 the variance of inorganic nitrogen concentration organic carbon concentration and ph value was based on the data of 3 years 3 results 3 1 the change of reclaimed water quality along the model dp 3 1 1 change of inorganic nitrogen and ph value in reclaimed water fig 1 a shows the change in inorganic nitrogen concentration in the model dp during the whole experiment as fig 1 a showed that the average nh4 n concentration was 4 49 mg l 1 in the influent and 1 11 mg l 1 in the effluent of r4 the no3 n concentration clearly increased from 3 13 mg l 1 in the influent to 7 14 mg l 1 in the effluent of r4 however no2 n concentration decreased from 1 34 mg l 1 in the influent to 0 49 mg l 1 at the outlet of r4 the variance in inorganic nitrogen concentration indicated that an obvious nitrification occurred in the model dp fig 1 b exhibits that the ph value appeared increasing trend along the flow course as it was known nitrification produced almost two strong acid equivalents per mole of nh4 removed which would lower the ph value normally so the variation of ph value along the flow course indicated that nitrification may be not the only biochemical process occurred in the model dp to investigate this apparent contradiction a calculation of nitrogen balance in the reclaimed water of model dp was carried out the statistical result exhibited that the obvious loss of nitrogen accounted for 65 6 in the total samples under the fluctuated concentration of influent nitrogen in the model dp this result indicated that the nitrogen concentration in the reclaimed water model dp was decreased along the flow course considering the phenomenon of increased ph value along the flow course it was supposed that denitrification may occur in somewhere of the biofilm in the reclaimed water model dp it made sense that the model system had been operating for more than three years in continuous flow mode thereby allowing microorganisms in reclaimed water to colonize and settle on the surfaces of the coupons and forming a mature biofilm the mature biofilm could provide protection for several denitrifiers which can transform no3 n or no2 n to n2 under appropriate conditions e g available electron donor 3 1 2 change of organic carbon in reclaimed water along the model dp doc and bdoc are important parameters to describe the concentration of organic carbon in reclaimed water fig 2 shows the concentration variations of doc and bdoc along the flow course in the model dp the average concentration of doc was slightly low in the influent and increased in the first reactor r1 soon afterward it decreased gradually along the flow course the bdoc concentration decreased from the influent to the last reactor r4 step by step the bdoc concentration in the current experiment ranged from 0 81 mg l 1 to 1 66 mg l 1 the relatively high concentration of bdoc provided the possible electron donor available for denitrification the general trend of doc and bdoc concentrations in the model dp indicated that organic carbon was consumed gradually although the amount of both was tiny the loss of nitrogen the increase in ph value and the decrease in organic carbon concentration along the flow course showed that denitrification did occur in the model dp 3 2 nitrification and denitrification activity of biofilm along the model dp 3 2 1 nitrification activity of the biofilm to demonstrate the difference of nitrification along the model distribution pipe fed with reclaimed water nitrification rates of biofilm in each reactor described by aur and nur were measured and showed in fig 3 it revealed that the aur and nur of biofilm in each cdc reactor varied largely the aur reduced from 11 52 to 4 17 mg nh4 n m2 biofilm h and the nur was decreased from 13 16 to 1 54 mg no2 n m2 biofilm h from the r1 to the r4 moreover the aur and nur of biofilm in r1 were much higher than those in other reactors and the nitrification rate was followed as r1 r2 r3 r4 as shown in table 1 a certain amount of residual chlorine existed in the influent of reclaimed water which could cause a suppression of biofilm activity by inhibiting microorganisms at the inlet of the dp however the nitrification activity in r1 was unexpectedly the highest which implied that the nitrifiers in the reclaimed water had a good resistance to the disinfectant under good nutrient condition 3 2 2 denitrification activity of the biofilm to demonstrate the difference in denitrification in the model dp the denitrification rates of the biofilm in each reactor were measured based on the medium of nitrate and nitrite as shown in fig 4 the denitrification rates of the biofilm in each cdc reactor varied significantly and with different changing trends generally the transformation rate of no2 was slower than that of no3 for biofilm in the same reactor when nitrate was utilized as the nitrogen source the denitrification rate gradually increased from 5 18 mg no3 n g biofilm h in r1 to 9 45 mg no3 n g biofilm h in r3 and then declined to 4 74 mg no3 n g biofilm h in r4 when nitrite was utilized as the nitrogen source the denitrification rate increased from 1 45 mg no2 n g biofilm h in r1 to 2 81 mg no2 n g biofilm h in r2 and then gradually declined to 1 47 mg no2 n g biofilm h in r4 the change of the biofilm exhibited a higher denitrification rate with nitrate as the nitrogen source could be attributed to the fact that no3 n concentration was always higher than no2 n concentration in the reclaimed water model dp while the nitrite was the only intermediate product of nitrification and denitrification and kept a lower concentration in the model dp thus the denitrification rate of the biofilm in r3 was much higher than those of the others when nitrate was employed as the nitrogen source with an ordinal rank of observed denitrification rate r3 r2 r1 r4 however the observed denitrification rate of the biofilm in r2 was much higher than those of the others when nitrite was employed as the nitrogen source with an ordinal rank of r2 r3 r1 r4 the shift in biofilm denitrification rate had a strong relationship with the change of water quality along the flow course in this experiment as mentioned above a certain amount of residual chlorine and low concentration of do existed in the influent of reclaimed water which could cause an inhibition on denitrifier activity in biofilm at the inlet of the dp in addition the high concentration of ammonium in the influent provided the substrate for nitrification which subsequently became the substrate for denitrification in the succeeding reactors under the condition of a certain amount of doc as for r4 the concentrations of no3 n no2 n and bdoc were unavoidably the lowest one among the four reactors which made the biofilm lowest activity of nitrification and denitrification in general the evident denitrification activity could be observed in the model dp and the denitrification rates of biofilm in r2 and r3 were higher than those in r1 and r4 which might be attributed to the concentration gradient of residual chlorine and bdoc as well as the wettability difference of nanochannels in the biofilm surfaces along the flow course 19 3 3 sem of the biofilm surfaces fig 5 shows the sem image of the micro pore on the biofilm surface in the different reactors of the reclaimed water model dp as shown in fig 5 different characteristic voids were observed on the biofilm formed in different reactors the biofilm surfaces of r2 r3 and r4 had gas pores similar to the denitrification pores according to the size of the hole while no obvious gas pores occurred on the biofilm surface of r1 it made sense that the gas pores existed in the biofilm of r2 which was observed the maximum denitrification rate according to nitrite as for the biofilm in r3 only few gas pores appeared on its surface where the dominant process of denitrification was to transform no3 to no2 however it seemed that it was hard to understand the homogeneous gas pores approximately 1 μm on the biofilm of r4 because both the denitrification rates according to nitrate and nitrite were the minimum for the biofilm of r4 anyway the observable gas pores on the biofilm surface of model dp appeared here and there the reason why the pores on the biofilm surface were significantly different in abundance and size may be attributed to the existence of different microorganisms as well as the different quantities of nitrogenous gas released 3 4 microbial community 3 4 1 clone analysis clone analysis was conducted for the four cdc biofilm reactors after more than three years of the experiment sixty five different dgge bands were detected in all the samples among them 36 representative dgge bands were excised and sequenced altogether more than eight bacterial phyla were recovered from the samples relative abundance of each bacteria was calculated with the relative intensities of the sequences affiliated with different phyla to the total number of sequences which was regarded as the relative proportion of each phylum in each band the bacterial community of the influent and four biofilm samples in phylum and level were presented in fig 6 fig 6 shows that acidobacteria appeared in all the samples and dominated the influent and the biofilm of r1 accounting for 33 58 and 38 11 of the clones respectively both bacteroidetes and nitrospirae were abundant in all the biofilm samples but were scarce in the influent firmicutes bacterial group tested in all the samples except for the biofilm of r1 accounted for 20 79 and 30 95 in the biofilms of r2 and r3 respectively chloroflexi only occurred in the biofilm of r4 and was absent in the other samples of the model dp in addition alphaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria also existed in the model dp however an obvious difference in the proteobacteria phylum was observed along the flow course alphaproteobacteria was present in all sample sites along the flow course although the abundance was uneven the abundance of betaproteobacteria was generally low and absent in the biofilm of r4 gammaproteobacteria appeared a high abundance in influent but disappeared along most of the model dp and presented a little in r4 at the order level sphingomonadales affiliated with alphaproteobacteria burkholderiales and nitrosomonadales affiliated with betaproteobacteria and pseudomonadales affiliated with gammaproteobacteria were predominant in the biofilm samples however flavobacterium sphingomonas and pseudomonas were found in all the samples but at different relative abundance at the genera level in general nitrospirae were abundant in all biofilm samples and the percentages of nitrospirae in samples of r1 r2 r3 and r4 13 3 11 8 12 2 and 13 0 respectively were obviously higher than that in sample of the influent 2 5 in addition nitrosomonadales affiliated with betaproteobacteria were also detected in most of the biofilm samples r1 r2 and r3 on the other side pseudomonas flavobacteria sphingobacteria and acinetobacter were detected in the influent and biofilms of the model dp these bacterial genera detected in the biofilm of model dp provided the basis of microbial community for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification in reclaimed water delivery 3 4 2 diversity analysis the shannon wiener index of diversity was calculated for the different communities based on the species affiliation of the clone sequences the diversity indices of the different sampling sites were shown in table 2 the values of the shannon wiener index in r2 and r4 were very close and both of them had a relatively high level of bacterial diversity the bacterial diversity in the biofilm of the model dp except for r1 was higher than that of the influent this phenomenon may be due to the high concentration of disinfectant in the finished tank of reclaimed water which hindered microorganism growth at the front of the model dp 4 discussion simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd has received considerable attention in wastewater treatment system but the knowledge of snd in dp is very rare at present the results obtained from this study suggested that snd did occur in a model dp fed with disinfected reclaimed water 4 1 co exist of nitrifier and denitrifier in the biofilm of dp fed with reclaimed water in this study nitrospirae were found abundant in all biofilm samples of model dp although a lower percentage occurred in the influent 2 5 meanwhile nitrosomonadales affiliated with betaproteobacteria were also detected in most of the biofilm samples some researchers found that nitrospira was the dominant bacteria related to colonize the surfaces comprising a majority of the biofilm cells 20 it was also the dominant nitrifier of the biofilm in the model dp of reclaimed water reported in our previous work 18 nitrosomonas spp and nitrosospira spp affiliated with betaproteobacteria constituted a fraction of the aob in drinking water distribution systems as well as nitrospira spp and nitrobacter spp belonging to nob were also reported in biofilms of the drinking water distribution system 21 24 the current research demonstrated that the species of nitrifiers in the reclaimed water dp were similar to that in the drinking water distribution system and the nitrifiers in the reclaimed water had an excellent adaptation to the disinfectant under better nutrient condition compared with drinking water recent molecular techniques has also provided valuable insights into the structure and function of wastewater denitrification communities 25 26 undoubtedly the reclaimed water delivered in the model dp was from the effluent of wastewater treatment plant in the present experiment therefore it was not unexpected that the denitrifiers existed in the influent and biofilm of the model dp however it is difficult to elucidate the community composition of denitrifiers by molecular methods because denitrifying bacteria exhibit high taxonomic diversity in our work pseudomonas flavobacteria sphingobacteria and acinetobacter were detected in the influent and biofilms of the model dp pseudomonas was the major genus of gammaproteobacteria in the biofilm samples associated with denitrification as well as frequently reported to be capable of denitrification in most wastewater treatment plant and lab scale systems previous studies had observed pseudomonas aeruginosa with high concentrations in automatic faucets 27 28 other researchers had also reported that flavobacteria and sphingobacteria in biofilms had the capability for hydrogenotrophic denitrifying 29 30 meanwhile bacteria belonging to the genera acinetobacter dominated in hydrogen oxidizing microbial cultures 31 therefore part of the potential denitrifiers detected in the current study belonged to hydrogen oxidizing denitrifiers one of the autotrophic denitrifications while the other partial microorganisms probably participated in heterotrophic denitrification many studies have shown that nitrifiers and denitrifiers can co exist in a biofilm system where the denitrifiers are located at the bottom layer and the nitrifiers are located on the surface 32 33 being the intermediate or resultant product of the denitrification process no2 n2o and final n2 gas could be accumulated in the deeper layer of the biofilm these gases eventually erupt through the biofilm and form denitrification pores on the biofilm surface for gas release when the inner pressure is sufficiently high 34 this study exhibited the denitrification gas pores formed on the biofilm surface of model dp and found the remarkable gas pores mainly occurred on the biofilm surface of r2 and r4 however whether or not autotrophic denitrification functioned in r4 still need further proof in the future in brief nitrospirae and nitrosomonadales mainly responsible for nitrification were detected in most of the biofilm samples along the model dp meanwhile pseudomonas flavobacteria sphingobacteria and acinetobacter potentially capable of denitrification were also detected in the influent and biofilms of the model dp the co existence of nitrifiers and denitrifiers in the model dp biofilm of reclaimed water led to the occurrence of snd and the presence of denitrification gas pores the denitrification gas pores along the model dp varied from different denitrification processes totally depending on different elector donors available although the gas pores were similar apparently in this study part of the gas pores may origin from the autotrophic denitrification but most of the gas pores were probably due to the participation of heterotrophic denitrifiers anyway snd did happen in the model dp of reclaimed water to our knowledge this is the first report about snd in the dp of reclaimed water at present and there is more work to investigate further 4 2 effect of snd in the dp on the end water quality of reclaimed water there is no doubt that nitrification could convert nh4 n into no2 n or no3 n which would be converted further into no2 n2o and final n2 gas through denitrification process in the reclaimed water thus snd expectedly led the concentration of ammonia and total nitrogen to decrease in the end water of the dp meanwhile the organic carbon is necessary to complete the heterotrophic denitrification given that the quality standard for reclaimed water allows for a small quantity of organic substrates e g biological oxygen demand in reclaimed water was restricted to below 6 mg l 1 for scenic environment use in china some residual organic carbon unavoidably exists in reclaimed water and can be used for heterotrophic denitrifiers 35 in this experiment there was little increase in doc concentration of r1 and then decreased during water transmission through the model dp the increase of doc concentration in r1 may be attributed to the disinfection of reclaimed water by which the natural organic material dissolved in water can be oxidized by disinfectants e g clo2 cl2 to produce another fraction of doc for heterotrophic bacteria 36 37 on the other side bdoc concentration was decreased along the model dp step by step which led to a lower concentration of bdoc in the water of end reactor r4 compared with the finished reclaimed water in the plant it was evident the denitrification rate of biofilm in r2 and r3 was higher than that in r1 and r4 fig 3 which might be ascribed to readily available carbon existing in r2 and r3 since the measurable disinfectants presented in r1 so the denitrification rate of biofilm in dp of reclaimed water depended on the available carbon concentration however the homogeneous and obvious gas pores appeared not only on the biofilm surface of r2 but on the biofilm surface of r4 which indicated some autotrophic denitrification might appear in r4 as the analysis of bacterial community mentioned in brief snd in the dp fed with reclaimed water would cause the concentrations of ammonia total nitrogen doc and bdoc reduced the decreased concentrations of doc and bdoc implied a stable water quality for the end users compared with the finished water in the plant so snd in the dp fed with reclaimed water is benefit for the end water quality of the reclaimed water 5 conclusion simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd could happen in a distribution pipe dp fed with the reclaimed water even under a certain amount of residual chlorine existed in the influent snd would cause nitrogen loss ph value increase and organic carbon decrease after a long delivery a complicated microbial community including typical nitrifiers and denitrifiers was involved in the biofilm system of model dp which played a key role in snd nitrifiers of biofilm in dp appeared low susceptible to residual chlorine thereby leading to strong nitrification activity at the forepart of the dp the above conclusion revealed that the end water quality tended to stable after a long delivery for reclaimed water due to snd which may provide valuable reference and guidance to the designers and managers of the water resource declaration of competing interest the authors do not have any possible

14051,to improve persian gulf severely damaged marine environment and prevent long term exposure risks of toxic chemicals being discharge into the sea total cod removal of produced water pw at a south pars gas field is proposed by electrochemical oxidation process eo using ti sb sno2 anode modified with graphene oxide go prepared in a simple and cost effective technique comprehensive electrochemical tests morphological and structural examinations indicated that addition of go improved considerably electrocatalytic activity for the fabricated anode confirmed formation of uniform sno2 nanoparticles ranging 15 26 nm and presence of reduced go maximum cod removal and energy efficiency for the pre discharged offshore oxidation process unit was optimized using box behnken methodology in the eo design experiments for 2 h electrolysis of pw with prepared anodes software optimized conditions of cd 10 ma cm2 ph 4 00 electrode distances of 10 mm and predicted 59 96 cod removal and energy efficiency of 42 83 g kwh which were compatible with experimental data of 58 60 and 42 63 g kwh respectively cod removal rate equation was a pseudo first order with a constant rate of 0 006 min 1 considering offshore platform operational limitations and associated process economics the optimized eo unit process cost for total cod removal of pw was estimated at u 5 74 m3 abbreviations pw produced water go graphene oxide cod chemical oxygen demand eo electrochemical oxidation rgo reduced graphene oxide keywords produced water electrochemical oxidation tin oxide reduced graphene oxide offshore gas platform 1 introduction in offshore oil and gas platform operations produced water pw represents the largest volume of waste stream worldwide 800 mm3 y in 2003 1 which is either reinjected into the well or as most often is the case separated and treated offshore to reduce its pollution capacity before being discharged into the sea pw changes in terms of volume from 5 15 vol to 75 90 vol and chemical compositions throughout the lifespan of the reservoir 2 iranian offshore gas field platforms produces on average 2 8 mm3 year of pw and like many similar worldwide pw s no deep well injection occurs due to conventional cost concerns geological limitations and lack of general investment in advanced technologies and regional international regulatory cooperation and monitoring desperately needed in the persian gulf and ignored for decades largely due to political tensions wars etc however improper monitoring of pw discharge could impose huge environmental penalties by introducing many potentially toxic compounds into the living biological communities at sea 4 5 in the light of increasing intense public concern in recent years for environmental degradation at sea a number of studies supported under the auspices of oil and gas reserve developers have focused on limited evidence of pollution impacts being reported in the literature essentially based on less understood measurements by biomarker studies or complicated distribution flow patterns and long term exposure to pollutants at sea 4 6 7 investigating distribution of associated chemical contaminants as well as nutrients iron and barite at sea however have indicated that contamination is most prevalent at sea around the platform itself 6 these nevertheless confirm much needed regulations and monitoring as well as appropriate actions which could be taken by producers in terms of chemicals being used and introduction of more effective pw treatment processes whereby the best sustainable way to protect and preserve marine environments is determined in a manner that petroleum resource development is not threatened neither 7 consequential ecological harms for species include changes in populations and communities genetic diversity lower reproduction and growth respiratory problems behavioral and physiological disorders as well as developmental and endocrine disruptions 8 pw contaminants contains a complex mixture of inorganic salts metals radioisotopes and a wide variety of organic chemicals including water soluble and semi soluble hydrocarbons eg benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes btex polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah naphthalenes phenanthrenes and dibenzothiophenes npd organic acids phenol alkylated phenols natural low radioactive elements and traces of biocides scale inhibitors emulsion breakers added in the production separation line a number of chemicals which are soluble in oil could be separated using conventional hydrocyclones installed on the platform however many environmentally dangerous dissolved hydrocarbons organic acids phenols and metals which have extremely low allowable threshold cannot be separated by hydrocyclones and end up being dumped into the sea 5 for instance one ring aromatic hydrocarbons btex which cause irreparable damage to the central nervous system 2 have a maximum allowable concentration in surface water of 85 μg dm3 9 also pah s which contain two or more fused aromatic rings are of greatest environmental concern in pw due to their toxicity and persistence in the marine environment 1 10 and have the maximum allowable concentration of 1 μg dm3 11 dissolved hydrocarbons leaked into the sea are consumed by the bacteria algae causing increased chemical oxygen demand cod contaminants and eutrification killing eventually other living organisms in the aquatic systems that require higher oxygenation hence strict standards for maximum oxygen demand for all discharged wastewaters have been set whereby the maximum oil content and cod in discharged pw are less than 40 and 150 mg dm3 respectively 9 12 biological physicochemical and even thermal treatments could be employed for pw treatment be it at some costs and operational limitations including toxic gases generation excess residual sludge resistance to phase transfer of contaminants etc conventional biological treatments of pw however are difficult due to the high degree of salinity and land requirement 2 13 other separation techniques such as flocculation precipitation adsorption extraction and reverse osmosis require post treatments before disposition is allowed 14 15 hence in response to develop more efficient systems electrochemical treatments have been considered which have already been investigated successfully for treating industrial effluents in such mediums as dyes dairy herbicides pesticides heavy metals pulp and paper as well as leachate and effluents from foods pharmaceuticals minerals chemicals and petrochemical industries 2 16 17 more specifically electrochemical oxidation eo where organic pollutants are oxidized at the anode surface in an electrolyte cell is proposed to be added for treating pw at offshore gas platforms for total cod removal fig 1 due to the advantages offered including high efficiency flexibility environmental compatibility simplicity in operation energy saving little or no sludge production no requirement for chemical reagents robust system configuration and reliable performance for a wide variety of toxic organics in pw furthermore small surface area is required which suits the insitu operation at the offshore platforms thereby avoiding extensive transfer costs of pw to the land 18 in the mean time it is worth mentioning that eo application is currently limited to some extent by such factors as influent flow rate 42 considerable operating costs the need for electricity supply anode instability undesirable chlorinated by products in salty waters 20 59 and high cod influent 1 which justify further research for specific applications as set out here eo process performance is influenced by such variables as anode material oxidizable content reaction rate of the oxidizing agents and contaminants electrolysis duration electrolyte and operating conditions like applied current density ph temperature and cell geometry fig 2 illustrates the schematics of an industrial eo unit to be placed just before hs pw is discharged into the sea in practice treating each or a set of contaminant s require an optimal combination of conditions as far as energy efficiency and cod removal are concerned which could flexibly be achieved by modifying a number of influencing parameters in design and operation 13 19 anode should however possess specific characteristics including long service life large surface area wide operating potential window between hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction oer high catalytic activity physical stability resistant to corrosion cheap and easy fabrication 20 electrodes made from stainless steel varieties of carbons as well as lead manganese and iron undergo deformation during electrolysis 2 21 on the other hand boron doped diamond bdd has been noted by a number of researcher for its inert surface characteristics low adsorption properties for hydroxyl radical corrosion stability even in acidic media high oxygen evolution overpotential oep and high current efficiencies 19 22 despite these there are drawbacks in its industrial application due to complicated and costly preparation moreover applied cell voltage is high and surface reconstruction is difficult 23 24 dimensionally stable anodes dsa have been developed since 1950 s as energy efficient electrodes with good conductivity 25 pt 26 90 iro2 27 29 ruo2 30 31 tio2 29 32 33 pbo2 34 and sno2 35 are such dsa s with good operating life 19 36 37 capable of generating hydroxyl radicals with high catalytic activity dimensional stability and good oep as far as eo limitations and potentials of eo is concerned several studies have addressed these in the literature for instance application of platinum supported on titanium 38 proved extensive production of hydroxyl radicals however pt was expensive and fouling prone in a number of studies on iro2 and ruo2 electrodes 39 40 their dissolution in basic medium and high anodic potentials were reported where contaminants could not be effectively degraded in wastewater due to their low oep also oer competes with contaminants degradation reaction at electrode which leads to increased energy consumption hence such electrodes could not be employed for eo large scale industrial applications in other investigation on several hydrocarbon contaminated effluents ti iro2 ta2o5 and bdd 1 were compared for cod removal from pw bdd removed significantly higher cod with less energy requirements than ti iro2 ta2o5 however at higher temperatures ti iro2 ta2o5 anode exhibited better performances oil samples from petroleum effluents were also treated using ti ru0 34ti0 66o2 41 where 57 cod reduction was achieved after 70 h at 50 c with a current density of 100 ma cm2 in another work ti ruo2 tio2 sno2 42 was also studied for organic contaminants degradation with a current density of 89 ma cm2 using different effluent flow rates 0 25 1 3 dm3 h where removal efficiencies decreased from 98 to 84 pbo2 23 24 exhibit good electrochemical activity comparable to that of bdd for oxidation of contaminants however metal dissolution of pb2 remains a serious environmental hse concern 19 especially at high cl concentrations 1 where adhesion of the oxides active layer on substrate is not strong enough due to elevated internal stresses causing therefore the pbo2 coating layer being easily detached 25 considering the technical challenges mentioned above sno2 was noted as a viable option for organic contaminants degradation using eo higher oep of sno2 19 43 translates into higher electrocatalytic activity for the production of hydroxyl radicals 44 45 thereby suppressing electrode fouling and restoring its activity 46 sno2 also offers other advantages for instance it crystallizes in a rutile type structure which is an insulator capable of resisting chemical etching in acidic or alkali mediums in the presence of a dopants such as ce 47 bi 48 49 gd 50 ir and la 51 ni 52 53 f 54 in iii 55 and sb v 56 sno2 mix metal oxide conductivity corrosion resistance adhere to the base metal and stability over a large ph range are all improved significantly 57 58 sb however has proven to be a remarkable dopant for sno2 58 since sb5 and sn4 ions with ionic radius 0 74 å and 0 83 å respectively are within the 15 hume rothery limit a homogeneous solid solution between the two metals could be attained sb dopant reduces the sno2 film resistivity influences microcrystalline structure morphology electrocatalytic activity oep and also enhances hydroxyl radicals generation 18 19 for instance addition of 8 mol sb enhanced oep beyond 1 9 v vs standard calomel electrode sce 34 in another work the highest cod removal 48 9 of 4 chlorophenol was achieved with 5 sb doped on sno2 58 additionally conductive forms of carbon such as graphene oxide go have been used to improve the anode electrical conductivity 59 61 go has very high tensile and mechanical strengths with an amphiphilic molecular structure that could reduce substantially the interfacial energy moreover functional groups on the surfaces and edges of go nanosheets could allow for expedient synthesis of hybrids and improve the hydrophilicity lipophilicity of the carbon materials leading to enhanced wettability and facilitated rapid electrolyte ion transport within the micropores 60 the presence of functional groups on the surface of carbonaceous materials makes it easy to disperse in solvents leading to better interaction with metal cations however reactive sn2 has a strong reduction capability 62 could gradually reduce the go oxygen containing groups be it not thoroughly to a form referred as reduced graphene oxide rgo which offers even better electrical conductivity than go 63 65 interestingly rgo is successfully used as the metal nanoparticles support for electrocatalyzing of organic materials 63 sno2 graphene go rgo heterostructures have also been employed as anode in lithium ion batteries 66 67 counter electrode in dye sensitized solar cells photocatalysts for organic oxidation 68 and gas sensors 69 clearly in eo treatment anode fabrication plays a pivoting role in the success of eo treatment proper substrate pretreatment is one key element in provision of a strong adhesion of metal oxide coating on the substrate surface 12 precursor solution dopant and its content coating technique withdrawal rate annealing temperature and number of coating applied are other crucial factors influencing the desired anode characteristics 20 70 dip coating and thermal decomposition 71 conveniently offer such advantages as simplicity low cost ease of adding doping improved growth rate and mass production capability for uniform large area coatings which are necessary for industrial applications however it is worth noting that presence of nacl or cl for eo treatment of pw could adversely affect anode characteristics while the ensuing active chlorine generation could also improves oxidation of organics 72 93 hence a deeper examination of the electrochemical oxidation mechanism could prove useful in development of this technique the main reactions of the sno2 anode may be detailed as follows 44 88 90 1 sno2 xh2o sno2 oh x xh xe 2 r sno2 oh x sno2 co2 xh xe 3 sno2 oh x sno2 x xh xe 4 r sno2 x sno2 rox where r corresponds to the organic contaminants as can be seen upon contact of water molecules with the sno2 based metal electrode physisorbed hydroxyl radicals sno2 oh x is produced at high anodic potentials 70 90 these readily react with organic substrates in the vicinity of the electrode surface to form co2 and h2o thereby removing cod by electrochemical oxidation strong interaction of the hydroxyl radical oh with the anode metal chemically absorb radicals leads to formation of higher oxide state sno2 x 21 which could further react with the organic contaminants however complete oxidation of organic contaminants expressed in eq 2 occurs much more readily compared to eq 4 18 44 it should be noted that oxygen evolution reaction always competes with the oxidation reaction of organics 19 as follows 5 sno2 oh x snox 1 1 2o2 xh xe 6 snox 2 sno1 x 1 2 o2 the reaction in eq 6 is inhibited however at higher oep this encourages reaction with organic contaminants to occur easily other electrochemical oxidation reactions also take place which do not necessarily contribute directly to the electrochemical organic oxidation at the same time the ensuing oxidative species hydroxyl free radicals ozone and chlorine will result in cod removal via chemical oxidation as follows 7 2h2o 2e h2 2oh 8 3h2o o3 6h 6e 9 2cl cl2 2e on the other hand in high saline pw chlorine is the most effective oxidant as it enhances contaminants removal by chloride evolution reaction cer below at anode 21 22 61 chlorine is produced on the anode surface and it suffers disproportionation to hypochlorous acid and hydrolysis to hypochlorite according to eqs 10 and 11 production of chlorates may also occur either electrochemically eq 12 or chemically eq 13 10 cl2 h2o hocl h cl 11 hocl 3h2o 2clo3 4 cl 12 h 3 2 o2 6e 12 cl2 6oh clo3 5cl 3h2o 13 clo clo3 2 cl the resulting active chlorine species oxidize the organics efficiently as follows 21 sno2 oh x xcl sno2 hocl x xe 14 sno2 hocl x r intermediates sno2 x co2 h2o xcl xh 15 presence of nacl in the pw do lead to formation of organochlorine compounds rcl which are readily consumed during the electrolysis 20 59 on cathode the main electrochemical reduction reactions are 16 2h2o 2e h2 2oh 17 o2 4h 4e 2h2o 18 o2 2h 2e h2o2 none of these reactions contribute directly to cod removal however hydrogen peroxide produced could contribute to cod removal 18 also oh species could encourage hydroxide formation with calcium and magnesium which exist in the pw as follows 20 ca2 hco3 oh caco3 h2o 21 mg2 2oh mg oh 2 these inorganic compounds are deposited on the cathode in salt formation and causing increased resistivity in the cell 1 3 application of the anode made from sno2 sb modified with graphene oxide on titanium substrate ti sno2 sb rgo developed in this study for eo treatment of pw is not reported in the literature yet having identified the anode characteristics based on the electrochemical tests and morphological structures performance evaluation with respect to cod removal and energy efficiency were optimized using box behnken methodology followed by a preliminary economic evaluation of the eo process proposed at the offshore platform 2 experimental 2 1

naoh h2so4 k2cr2o7 agso4 sncl4 5h2o oxalic acid and hg2so4 from merck germany and sbcl3 from fluka italy 2 2 apparatus the apparatus employed for the experimental works included gas chromatography

to 110 electrochemical tests were also conducted using potentiostat galvanostat fra zive sp1 electrochemical workstation run by smart manager software in three electrode cell counter and reference electrodes were platinum and sce respectively electrolyte was 0 5 m h2so4 solution from merck germany current density was provided using a dual tracking dc power supply escort also a ph meter metrohm 744 as well as a multiparameter instrument hq40d hach were used for conductivity and temperature measurements cod analysis was performed using a hach lange dr 3900 spectrophotometer after digesting samples in a thermoreactor cr 2200 wtw 2 3 pw sampling and characterization the samples were collected from an iranian south gas field and stored at 4 c in polypropylene bottles the offshore gas platform see fig 1 consisted of the gas well production test manifolds well testing facilities free water knock out facilities condensate coaleser water treatment package and associated utilities the reservoir fluid was collected on the well head platform and routed to shore via a subsea pipeline after pw separation 3 characteristics of the two samples pw and hs pw or hydrocyclone separated are presented in table1 pw refers to the effluent accompanied with natural gas without any treatment retention degassing and de oiling process with hydrocyclones while hs pw refers to the effluent undergone hydrocyclones separation before being discharged into the sea fig 1 all eo related experiments were conducted on the hs pw and fig 3 shows the gc ms results obtained on its organic phase content 2 4 electrode preparation go was prepared by improved hummers method 62 1 0 g go was added into 200 ml deionized water and ultrasonically dispersed for 3 h 5 mg ml solution titanium plates 35 mm 42 mm 0 6 mm and 20 mm 10 mm 0 6 mm were preferred and used as substrate over tantalum 18 where they were first polished with dry grinding cloth 180 mesh and waterproof abrasive paper 500 mesh and 1000 mesh before being degreased with 5 naoh solution and soaked in 10 h2so4 for 1 h the sheets were etched in boiling hydrochloric acid 18 v v at 98 c for 15 min to provide a gray surface with uniform roughness it was then washed with deionized water and kept in 1 oxalic acid solution to prepare the precursor solution stoichiometric quantities of metal salts metal chlorides were dissolved in the alcohol solvent directly and hydrochloric acid was then added to avoid hydrolysis of metal salts here therefore a mixture of 30 ml of n butanol and 10 ml hcl containing sncl4 5h2o sbcl3 and go prepared solution was configured on titanium substrate using dip coating technique and thermochemical decomposition as suggested elsewhere 25 anodes were coated and annealed dried at 130 c for in an oven and sintered at 450 c for 15 min in a muffle furnace 15 times before being finally annealed once more for 1 h to obtain superior morphological characteristics and wear resistance 19 73 calcinations temperature plays a critical role in the anodes electrocatalytic performance if less than 450 c incomplete oxidation of tin precursor occurs leading to formation of snox 1 x 2 nanolayer and reduced band gap while high calcinations temperature may not improve anodes service life and affect adversely the thermally unstable carbon within go causing difficulties in its doping into the sno2 based composites 69 2 5 electrolytic systems the electrolytic cell used for the experiments here consisted of 150 cc cylindrical glass 4 0 cm diameter and 6 0 cm height equipped with a magnetic stirrer 200 rpm and rectangular 3 5 cm 2 5 cm electrodes stainless steel cathode having initial ph adjusted to 4 0 6 5 and 9 0 by adding the required volume of 1 m h2so4 or 1 m naoh experimental runs were designed using design expert 11 software stat ease inc 74 all experiments were conducted at room temperature using their own similar but specified anodes for comparison purposes distance between electrodes varied from 10 15 and 20 mm while the cell operated under galvanostatic conditions at cd of 10 15 and 20 ma cm2 decontamination of pw samples were monitored from the abatement of their cod as per eq 22 22 c o d r e m o v a l c o d i c o d f c o d i 100 where c o d i and c o d f refer to the initial and final cod readings mg l respectively here saline water cod measurement procedure for high chloride content was implemented 75 76 the energy efficiency ep in g kwh defined as the amount of cod removed per consumed electricity was calculated as follows 23 e p q j u t where j is the current applied during electrolysis a t hr is the electrolysis time q g is the amount of cod removed and u v is the steady state cell voltage 18 electrode stability was investigated using the accelerated life test 44 performed by anodic polarization under galvanostatic conditions at 20 ma cm2 in 0 5 m h2so4 solution the anode potential was measured as a function of time considering deactivation to occur at 10 v 44 45 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrodes electrochemical characterizations 3 1 1 cyclic voltammetry cyclic voltammetry cv tests were performed within 0 2v 0 4 v with sweep rate ranging 10 200 mv s and anodes working area of 1 0 cm2 the system was stabilized at open circuit voltage for 5 10 min prior to each measurement interestingly all nearly rectangular configuration of the cv curves fig 4 and their corresponding linear double layer charging current vs sweep rate plots indicate good charge propagation within the electrodes and confirm nonfaradaic character of the current in this potential region 62 anode capacitance is defined as the absolute value of the linear plot slope 46 and is 60 μf cm2 for smooth oxide rf the relative roughness factor of electrodes reflects the electrode real surface area relative to the apparent geometric area table 2 shows the effect of adding go nanoparticle where rf improved remarkably which translates to more favorable electrocatalytic activity number of electroactive sites determines the electrode electrocatalytic performance and depends largely on the chemical composition of its layers the voltammetric charge q calculated by the surface area under the cv curves at a specific sweep rate reflects this characteristic it decreases with increasing the potential sweep rate for both electrodes this may be attributed to hindered exchange of charged components between the electrolyte solution and electroactive sites in less accessible parts of the electrode film surface 77 the total voltammetric charge q t indicate the total electrochemically active surface area of the oxide coating and is obtained by plotting 1 q against v1 2 as per eq 24 24 1 q 1 q t kv1 2 the outer voltammetric charge q o refers to the associated charge of the most accessible electroactive surface area is calculated using the following eq 25 25 q q o kv 1 2 considering q t q o q i the inner voltammetric charge q i is evaluated fig 5 a b illustrate the plots for both ti sb sno2 and ti sb sno2 rgo electrodes where good linear correlations are fitted clearly larger q t was observed for ti sb sno2 rgo electrode indicating that go introduction significantly improved the electrochemically active surface area fig 5a the higher q o also suggests that go modified electrode provided larger number of active sites for the electrocatalytic process accessible to the exchange of charged species fig 5b table 2 presents the corresponding voltammetric charges 3 1 2 electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis measurement was employed to characterize electrochemical interfacial properties system resistance and deactivation mechanism of the doped anodes 20 ac voltage of 5 mv in amplitude over a frequency range of 100 khz to 10 mhz was applied to the system and the corresponding response current and impedance were determined as a frequency function fig 6 a demonstrates the nyquist plots obtained by eis for both which are similar in form electrodes and nearly linear the equivalent circuit was used to interpret the eis spectra fig 6b with fitting parameters in table 3 associated errors of less than 12 indicate suitability of the proposed simulative circuit for effective fitting of the experimental data rs represents the solution resistance in higher frequency region and the semicircle in high frequency region corresponds to capacitance c2 and resistance r2 the larger the semicircle the higher the charge transfer resistance signifying the electrochemical behavior of the growth of a resistive hydrated layer at the oxide solution interface 46 however electrode electrolyte interface acts as an electrochemical double layer capacitance represented by a cpe constant phase element to reflect the electrodes complex morphology 45 also at the electrode coating solution interface there is a charge exchange and compensation hence charge transfer resistance r1 is considered in parallel with the cpe cpe value for ti sb sno2 go electrode is higher than that of ti sb sno2 indicating higher specific reaction areas of the former also lower r1 value of 6 48 kω as compared to 7 69 kω for the latter indicates higher electrochemical activity attained most likely by the improved conductivity and electrocatalytic performance for charge transfer between the electrode surface and solution of the go doped electrode 3 1 3 linear sweep voltammetry as discussed before higher oep corresponds to lesser unwanted decomposition of water molecule oep was evaluated here from the linear sweep voltammetry lsv curves fig 7 at 50 mv s and scan region from 0 to 3 0 v prior to the galvanostatic experiments the electrodes underwent a pretreatment in the cell by applying 3 0 ma cm2 for 15 min to complete surface oxidization recommended for the stability of succeeding scan oep was determined at the intersection of the tangent to the curve with the e v at the horizontal axis clearly the electrode modified by doping go had a higher oep 2 20 v than ti sno2 sb 2 12 v interestingly this was higher than that of ti sno2 sb y 2 05 v 78 ti sno2 sb2o3 nb2o5 pbo2 1 80 v 79 ti tio2 nts sno2 sb2o5 1 80 v 71 and ti re sb sno2 2 10 v 80 indicating its improved electrocatalytic activity 3 2 electrode morphology 3 2 1 xrd examination xrd tests provide information on the phase purity and average crystallite sizes of the prepared electrodes considering the standard data of the pdf card numbers of 41 1445 and 29 1484 and the xrd patterns for both electrodes prepared here fig 8 the indexed peaks correspond to diffraction angles indicating both tetragonal rutile and orthorhombic structures of sno2 formation of the orthorhombic phase is most likely caused by high stresses inside the particle layer during oxidation sno2 peaks are however broader compared to the ti peaks during the reduction process of go oxygenated functional groups epoxy oh cooh and c o groups undergo deoxygenation 65 resulting in provision of a broad peak around 2θ 24 as indicated in fig 8 the broad peak reveals the low crystallinity index of rgo which has a non stacking multilayer structure due to the presence of some oxygen functional groups this could be verified further by studying ft ir spectrum regarding antimony no diffraction peak was observed within 2θ 28 32 indicating either its low content or its doping into the sno2 lattice 81 xrd patterns identified no impurity confirming the high quality of the samples investigated crystallite particle size diameter d was evaluated using the debye scherrer eq 26 26 d k λ β c o s θ where λ is the x ray radiation wavelength k is a constant taken as 0 89 β full width at half maximum height in radian and θ is the bragg angle in the diffraction xrd maximum crystallite size dmax was 26 58 nm with an average size of 20 39 nm the smaller the crystallite size the more favorable the electrochemical capability of the electrode 45 the particle size was also determined by fesem technique which confirmed the xrd results the unit cell volume was also investigated for tetragonal sno2 using bragg s formula 71 not described here for brevity the corresponding lattice parameters and the volume of the unit cell obtained were lower than the standard sno2 suggesting greater distortion caused by the introduction of sb5 ions and go into the sno2 crystal lattice leading to the reduction of bond lengths between the metal and oxygen atoms therefore as suggested elsewhere 44 46 smaller unit cell volume and crystallite size of the electrode with rgo improve its electro catalytic activity 34 also nanoparticles help refining the crystal grains and increase the specific surface area and active sites 3 2 2 fesem fig 9 a c illustrates the morphological characterization of the rgo doped electrode using a fesem micrograph at various magnifications as can be seen the sno2 crystals appear in rather uniform round clusters fig 9a with well distributed and defined grooves which seem to prevent electrolyte diffusion into its compact texture as expected by increased number of inner active site due to the presence of rgo expressed in the cv investigations fig 9c illustrates nanosized uniform particles of less than 30 nm confirming to some extent the xrd results 82 some clusters however had a cracked morphology where the exposed coating composition was investigated by eds fig 9d results endorsed presence of o sn sb ti and c elements as illustrated in peaks in fig 9e having the atom percentages of 60 65 31 68 1 67 3 05 4 01 respectively the cracks in the cluster occur most likely due to high internal pressure of the surface layer and differences in the thermal expansion coefficient of the base metal and the coating leading to poor stability and erosion 19 91 these cracks inevitably lead to electrolyte diffusion and anode deactivation in the presence of nano sized particles the consequent high surface activity leads to a small elongation deformation under tensile stress which could in turn hinder the extension of cracks formed 3 2 3 ft ir ft ir spectrum fig 10 a b identifies the main functional groups in the structure of the anodes where the effect of go doped can clearly be observed the band ranged 400 700 cm 1 and specifically at 635 cm 1 confirms the sno2 formation as it can be assigned to the antisymmetric sn o sn stretching mode of the surface bridging oxide the peaks related to graphene oxide corresponds to oh ν o h at 1563 cm 1 ranging 3200 3400 cm 1 cc ν c c at 1615 cm 1 co ν c o at 1733 cm 1 and 1717 cm 1 and co ν c o at 1274 1220 cm 1 1050 cm 1 and1052 cm 1 and c h ν c h ranging 650 cm 1 and 750 cm 1 83 84 however as expected for the peaks associated with reduced go the intensities of absorption bands of the oxygen functionalities ν o h ν c o and ν c o have been decreased considerably confirming successful reduction of go where oh peaks have shifted to the higher wavenumber and carbonyl groups have disappeared the bonds in the region of 1176 cm 1 also corresponds to different types of surface hydroxyl groups 13 the peak at 2923 78 cm 1 corresponds to ch bonding associated to the acidic production phase and hence confirms the presence of carboxylic acid in the structure 3 2 4 accelerated life test the accelerated life test was carried out for ti sb sno2 rgo electrode and was compared with that of ti sb sno2 electrode fig 11 indicates sharp potential increase during the first 50 min followed by gradual increases for the next 500 min before anode deactivation at 10 v as can be seen addition of rgo has increased the time for anode stability by 250 min or nearly 70 surface morphology of anodes could help understand their deactivation process under high current density the anode crystalline structure change irreversibly causing deactivation produced cracks on the coating allow penetration of oxygen atoms generated by water electrolysis into the ti substrate which leads to formation of an insulating tio2 layer 44 on the other hand formation of a passive hydration layer on the electrode s surface is inevitable 45 and adherence of coating layer to the surface overcomes the van der waals interaction between the sno2 molecules resulting in surface aggregates and cracks 44 hence the electrode s failure blocks the charge transfer and this leads to a potential increase 3 3 electrochemical oxidation experiments amongst several operating variables which could influence the electrochemical oxidation of pw contaminants including cd ph electrodes distance electrolyte type initial contaminant concentration and temperature the last three were not investigated in this work due to our deliberate focus on working with the real pw and associated ambient conditions in the gas offshore platform where maintain an optimum value may not be economic or practical it is worth noting that eo is inherently exothermic that temperature affects both reaction rates of organic degradation in the bulk as well as the capacity of oh adsorption on the anode surface 20 to develop the response surface in 120 min electrolysis duration three factors of current density x1 initial ph

generated model which was also tested by the fisher f test where the model terms were evaluated by the p value probability with 95 confidence level table 5 indicates that fit quality for the polynomial equations eqs 27 28 were acceptable r2 values were close to unity also predicted r 2 value were reasonably close 0 2 to the adjusted r2 fig 12 demonstrates how the results correlate in terms of the three parameters of cd ph and electrode distance in general maximum cod removal could be achieved in the lower ph higher cd and larger electrodes distance however considering both y1 and y2 simultaneously changed the optimum conditions 3 3 1 effect of current density figs 12 a c d indicate that at higher cd improved cod removal and increased oer occurred the latter translates into higher o2 diffusion into the anodes and consequently their swifter deactivation and reduced energy efficiency in this work the upper limit for eo was taken as 20 ma cm2 as higher values accelerate anodes deactivation 3 3 2 effect of initial ph electrolyte ph influences the adsorption of contaminants molecules on the electrode surface at higher ph such organic compounds as phenol polymerize into a low permeable film which sticks to the electrode surface and causes fouling 20 on the other hand the presence of ca2 and mg2 ions associated with the saline pw however promotes scaling on the cathode the redox potential for hoaq h2o couple at different ph may be described by nernst as per eq 29 29 e0 hoaq h2o 2 59 0 059 ph for ph 7 or 14 the term e0 hoaq h2o becomes 2 18 v or 1 77 v respectively hence higher oxidative potential occurs at the lower ph range however lower ph reduces the oer which tend to favor the oxidation of organic compound 44 85 86 on the other hand chlorine molecule e0 cl2 cl 1 36 v exists only in neutral or acidic solution and very low ph leads to provision of lower concentration of species like hypochlorite and hypochlorous acid that can be further oxidized at the anode to form chlorate 86 fig 12 b c indicates that y1 and y2 were improved at acidic condition 3 3 3 effect of electrodes distance as can be seen from fig 12 a b d increasing the electrode spacing from 10 to 20 mm increased y1and y2 in the high saline pw investigated here however further increase to 25 mm led to reduction of y1 and y2 improving the cod removal at 20 mm indicate better performances of oxidative agents such as chlorine generated at anodes or less destructions of these at the cathode as for the y2 the optimum electrode distance was around 10 mm at which the applied electric field strength was higher very short electrode distance on the other hand could result in short circuits caused by either direct electrode linkage or conducting impurities present in the water 18 92 3 4 optimization software optimization predicted an optimized y1 72 68 when the three independent parameters of cd ph and electrode distance were considered however taking also the energy efficiency into account this became 59 96 at cd of 10 ma cm2 ph 4 00 and electrode distance 10 mm empirically at the same operating conditions y1 58 60 was achieved with y2 42 62 g kwh which was compatible with the predicted figure of 42 83 g kwh acidic optimized condition means that no additional additive is needed for ph adjustment furthermore formations of several chlorinated organic compounds rcl were detected on the optimized run conditions fig 13 illustrates the gc ms chromatograms for feed hs pw and post eo treatment saline pw provides chlorine resulting in rcl formation 20 45 87 88 which decomposed to undetectable levels in 235 min 3 5 cod removal rate fig 14 illustrates the change in relative concentration of cod against time which could be expressed as a pseudo first order kinetic reaction presented below 30 l n c o d t c o d i k t where codi is the initial cod concentration codt indicate cod concentration at time t and k is the reaction rate constant which for ti sno2 sb rgo was 0 006 min 1 for the optimized condition the effluent output characteristics are presented in table 6 where cod removal was almost complete after 235 min 3 6 preliminary design and economic evaluation of the eo unit as shown in fig 2 the designed eo process unit is simple and inexpensive capital cost for the unit was calculated based on the system capacity equipment and required utilities 21 covering items such as electrodes pumps impellers dc electricity generator and instrumentations for a 263 m3 day pw treatment facility this was estimated to be us 0 806 million for each gas offshore platform considering the time required for 100 elimination of the contaminants and this throughput the eo unit consists of 9 atmospheric batch reactors each having a capacity of 5 95 m3 operating cost was estimated to be us 1 580 million per year of which 92 was for anodes regenerations 6 for electricity and 2 for maintenance and other contingency costs as can been seen much of the costs incurred due to anodes regeneration which corresponds to the short life span of the anodes assuming 25 years life of the eo unit the electrochemical treatment cost of pw was estimated at us 5 74 m3 this is comparable to us 6 m3 the treatment cost 22 for treating a domestic wastewater using boron doped diamond and nanostructured amorphous carbon electrodes or us 5 6 m3 deep well injection 89 the high cost of treatment can be compensated against several advantages including easy operation simple and compactness of the equipment no transportation and storage of chemicals and no handling of chemical and more importantly no environmental penalty due to 100 removal of cod contaminants and no phase transfer of the accompanied pollutions 22 4 conclusions with an aim on protecting the environment sustainably and develop at one of the world largest gas reserve in the persian gulf and faced with lack of international legislation and effective monitoring of pollutants in these sensitive waters this study has attempted to enhance the offshore treatment process of the produced water by total removal of cod pollutants from a gas field platform considering space limitations on the platform and using the existing facilities here employing an electrochemical oxidation unit immediately after hydro cyclone separation and before discharging into the sea is proposed using anode of sno2 modified with graphene oxide following a review of the anode preparation techniques sno2 was selected as the most suitable material for efficient removal of organic material from hs pw it was then modified by go and prepared by a simple dip coating and thermal decomposition technique required for practical industrial application the anode performance was investigated experimentally through comprehensive electrochemical tests reported in detail here results have indicated that introduction of rgo to sno2 provided higher electrocatalytic activity due to improved voltammetric charge and increased relative roughness factor go modified anode led to higher oxygen evolution overpotential and less energy being consumed for competitive reactions eis studies showed that go modified ti sb sno2 electrode presented lower resistivity and better charge transfer xrd and fesem results confirmed formation of sno2 nanoparticles while eds and ft ir validated presence of rgo using an rsm technique and box behnken design the optimized conditions of cd 10 ma cm2 ph 4 00 electrode distances of 10 mm predicted 59 96 cod removal and energy efficiency of 42 83 g kwh which was compatible with the experimental data of 58 60 and 42 63 g kwh respectively formations of several chlorinated organic compounds rcl were also detected on the optimized run conditions which decomposed to undetectable levels in 235 min accordingly preliminary evaluation of the eo proposed unit was carried out and based on the degradation rate of pollutants calculated treatment cost for total cod removal of the gas platform discharged water was estimated at us 5 74 per cubic meter of hs pw which is cheaper than deep well injection easy and safe to operate and monitor and hence a recommendable approach for sustainable development of gas reserves at sea funding sources this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for

14051,to improve persian gulf severely damaged marine environment and prevent long term exposure risks of toxic chemicals being discharge into the sea total cod removal of produced water pw at a south pars gas field is proposed by electrochemical oxidation process eo using ti sb sno2 anode modified with graphene oxide go prepared in a simple and cost effective technique comprehensive electrochemical tests morphological and structural examinations indicated that addition of go improved considerably electrocatalytic activity for the fabricated anode confirmed formation of uniform sno2 nanoparticles ranging 15 26 nm and presence of reduced go maximum cod removal and energy efficiency for the pre discharged offshore oxidation process unit was optimized using box behnken methodology in the eo design experiments for 2 h electrolysis of pw with prepared anodes software optimized conditions of cd 10 ma cm2 ph 4 00 electrode distances of 10 mm and predicted 59 96 cod removal and energy efficiency of 42 83 g kwh which were compatible with experimental data of 58 60 and 42 63 g kwh respectively cod removal rate equation was a pseudo first order with a constant rate of 0 006 min 1 considering offshore platform operational limitations and associated process economics the optimized eo unit process cost for total cod removal of pw was estimated at u 5 74 m3 abbreviations pw produced water go graphene oxide cod chemical oxygen demand eo electrochemical oxidation rgo reduced graphene oxide keywords produced water electrochemical oxidation tin oxide reduced graphene oxide offshore gas platform 1 introduction in offshore oil and gas platform operations produced water pw represents the largest volume of waste stream worldwide 800 mm3 y in 2003 1 which is either reinjected into the well or as most often is the case separated and treated offshore to reduce its pollution capacity before being discharged into the sea pw changes in terms of volume from 5 15 vol to 75 90 vol and chemical compositions throughout the lifespan of the reservoir 2 iranian offshore gas field platforms produces on average 2 8 mm3 year of pw and like many similar worldwide pw s no deep well injection occurs due to conventional cost concerns geological limitations and lack of general investment in advanced technologies and regional international regulatory cooperation and monitoring desperately needed in the persian gulf and ignored for decades largely due to political tensions wars etc however improper monitoring of pw discharge could impose huge environmental penalties by introducing many potentially toxic compounds into the living biological communities at sea 4 5 in the light of increasing intense public concern in recent years for environmental degradation at sea a number of studies supported under the auspices of oil and gas reserve developers have focused on limited evidence of pollution impacts being reported in the literature essentially based on less understood measurements by biomarker studies or complicated distribution flow patterns and long term exposure to pollutants at sea 4 6 7 investigating distribution of associated chemical contaminants as well as nutrients iron and barite at sea however have indicated that contamination is most prevalent at sea around the platform itself 6 these nevertheless confirm much needed regulations and monitoring as well as appropriate actions which could be taken by producers in terms of chemicals being used and introduction of more effective pw treatment processes whereby the best sustainable way to protect and preserve marine environments is determined in a manner that petroleum resource development is not threatened neither 7 consequential ecological harms for species include changes in populations and communities genetic diversity lower reproduction and growth respiratory problems behavioral and physiological disorders as well as developmental and endocrine disruptions 8 pw contaminants contains a complex mixture of inorganic salts metals radioisotopes and a wide variety of organic chemicals including water soluble and semi soluble hydrocarbons eg benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylenes btex polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pah naphthalenes phenanthrenes and dibenzothiophenes npd organic acids phenol alkylated phenols natural low radioactive elements and traces of biocides scale inhibitors emulsion breakers added in the production separation line a number of chemicals which are soluble in oil could be separated using conventional hydrocyclones installed on the platform however many environmentally dangerous dissolved hydrocarbons organic acids phenols and metals which have extremely low allowable threshold cannot be separated by hydrocyclones and end up being dumped into the sea 5 for instance one ring aromatic hydrocarbons btex which cause irreparable damage to the central nervous system 2 have a maximum allowable concentration in surface water of 85 μg dm3 9 also pah s which contain two or more fused aromatic rings are of greatest environmental concern in pw due to their toxicity and persistence in the marine environment 1 10 and have the maximum allowable concentration of 1 μg dm3 11 dissolved hydrocarbons leaked into the sea are consumed by the bacteria algae causing increased chemical oxygen demand cod contaminants and eutrification killing eventually other living organisms in the aquatic systems that require higher oxygenation hence strict standards for maximum oxygen demand for all discharged wastewaters have been set whereby the maximum oil content and cod in discharged pw are less than 40 and 150 mg dm3 respectively 9 12 biological physicochemical and even thermal treatments could be employed for pw treatment be it at some costs and operational limitations including toxic gases generation excess residual sludge resistance to phase transfer of contaminants etc conventional biological treatments of pw however are difficult due to the high degree of salinity and land requirement 2 13 other separation techniques such as flocculation precipitation adsorption extraction and reverse osmosis require post treatments before disposition is allowed 14 15 hence in response to develop more efficient systems electrochemical treatments have been considered which have already been investigated successfully for treating industrial effluents in such mediums as dyes dairy herbicides pesticides heavy metals pulp and paper as well as leachate and effluents from foods pharmaceuticals minerals chemicals and petrochemical industries 2 16 17 more specifically electrochemical oxidation eo where organic pollutants are oxidized at the anode surface in an electrolyte cell is proposed to be added for treating pw at offshore gas platforms for total cod removal fig 1 due to the advantages offered including high efficiency flexibility environmental compatibility simplicity in operation energy saving little or no sludge production no requirement for chemical reagents robust system configuration and reliable performance for a wide variety of toxic organics in pw furthermore small surface area is required which suits the insitu operation at the offshore platforms thereby avoiding extensive transfer costs of pw to the land 18 in the mean time it is worth mentioning that eo application is currently limited to some extent by such factors as influent flow rate 42 considerable operating costs the need for electricity supply anode instability undesirable chlorinated by products in salty waters 20 59 and high cod influent 1 which justify further research for specific applications as set out here eo process performance is influenced by such variables as anode material oxidizable content reaction rate of the oxidizing agents and contaminants electrolysis duration electrolyte and operating conditions like applied current density ph temperature and cell geometry fig 2 illustrates the schematics of an industrial eo unit to be placed just before hs pw is discharged into the sea in practice treating each or a set of contaminant s require an optimal combination of conditions as far as energy efficiency and cod removal are concerned which could flexibly be achieved by modifying a number of influencing parameters in design and operation 13 19 anode should however possess specific characteristics including long service life large surface area wide operating potential window between hydrogen and oxygen evolution reaction oer high catalytic activity physical stability resistant to corrosion cheap and easy fabrication 20 electrodes made from stainless steel varieties of carbons as well as lead manganese and iron undergo deformation during electrolysis 2 21 on the other hand boron doped diamond bdd has been noted by a number of researcher for its inert surface characteristics low adsorption properties for hydroxyl radical corrosion stability even in acidic media high oxygen evolution overpotential oep and high current efficiencies 19 22 despite these there are drawbacks in its industrial application due to complicated and costly preparation moreover applied cell voltage is high and surface reconstruction is difficult 23 24 dimensionally stable anodes dsa have been developed since 1950 s as energy efficient electrodes with good conductivity 25 pt 26 90 iro2 27 29 ruo2 30 31 tio2 29 32 33 pbo2 34 and sno2 35 are such dsa s with good operating life 19 36 37 capable of generating hydroxyl radicals with high catalytic activity dimensional stability and good oep as far as eo limitations and potentials of eo is concerned several studies have addressed these in the literature for instance application of platinum supported on titanium 38 proved extensive production of hydroxyl radicals however pt was expensive and fouling prone in a number of studies on iro2 and ruo2 electrodes 39 40 their dissolution in basic medium and high anodic potentials were reported where contaminants could not be effectively degraded in wastewater due to their low oep also oer competes with contaminants degradation reaction at electrode which leads to increased energy consumption hence such electrodes could not be employed for eo large scale industrial applications in other investigation on several hydrocarbon contaminated effluents ti iro2 ta2o5 and bdd 1 were compared for cod removal from pw bdd removed significantly higher cod with less energy requirements than ti iro2 ta2o5 however at higher temperatures ti iro2 ta2o5 anode exhibited better performances oil samples from petroleum effluents were also treated using ti ru0 34ti0 66o2 41 where 57 cod reduction was achieved after 70 h at 50 c with a current density of 100 ma cm2 in another work ti ruo2 tio2 sno2 42 was also studied for organic contaminants degradation with a current density of 89 ma cm2 using different effluent flow rates 0 25 1 3 dm3 h where removal efficiencies decreased from 98 to 84 pbo2 23 24 exhibit good electrochemical activity comparable to that of bdd for oxidation of contaminants however metal dissolution of pb2 remains a serious environmental hse concern 19 especially at high cl concentrations 1 where adhesion of the oxides active layer on substrate is not strong enough due to elevated internal stresses causing therefore the pbo2 coating layer being easily detached 25 considering the technical challenges mentioned above sno2 was noted as a viable option for organic contaminants degradation using eo higher oep of sno2 19 43 translates into higher electrocatalytic activity for the production of hydroxyl radicals 44 45 thereby suppressing electrode fouling and restoring its activity 46 sno2 also offers other advantages for instance it crystallizes in a rutile type structure which is an insulator capable of resisting chemical etching in acidic or alkali mediums in the presence of a dopants such as ce 47 bi 48 49 gd 50 ir and la 51 ni 52 53 f 54 in iii 55 and sb v 56 sno2 mix metal oxide conductivity corrosion resistance adhere to the base metal and stability over a large ph range are all improved significantly 57 58 sb however has proven to be a remarkable dopant for sno2 58 since sb5 and sn4 ions with ionic radius 0 74 å and 0 83 å respectively are within the 15 hume rothery limit a homogeneous solid solution between the two metals could be attained sb dopant reduces the sno2 film resistivity influences microcrystalline structure morphology electrocatalytic activity oep and also enhances hydroxyl radicals generation 18 19 for instance addition of 8 mol sb enhanced oep beyond 1 9 v vs standard calomel electrode sce 34 in another work the highest cod removal 48 9 of 4 chlorophenol was achieved with 5 sb doped on sno2 58 additionally conductive forms of carbon such as graphene oxide go have been used to improve the anode electrical conductivity 59 61 go has very high tensile and mechanical strengths with an amphiphilic molecular structure that could reduce substantially the interfacial energy moreover functional groups on the surfaces and edges of go nanosheets could allow for expedient synthesis of hybrids and improve the hydrophilicity lipophilicity of the carbon materials leading to enhanced wettability and facilitated rapid electrolyte ion transport within the micropores 60 the presence of functional groups on the surface of carbonaceous materials makes it easy to disperse in solvents leading to better interaction with metal cations however reactive sn2 has a strong reduction capability 62 could gradually reduce the go oxygen containing groups be it not thoroughly to a form referred as reduced graphene oxide rgo which offers even better electrical conductivity than go 63 65 interestingly rgo is successfully used as the metal nanoparticles support for electrocatalyzing of organic materials 63 sno2 graphene go rgo heterostructures have also been employed as anode in lithium ion batteries 66 67 counter electrode in dye sensitized solar cells photocatalysts for organic oxidation 68 and gas sensors 69 clearly in eo treatment anode fabrication plays a pivoting role in the success of eo treatment proper substrate pretreatment is one key element in provision of a strong adhesion of metal oxide coating on the substrate surface 12 precursor solution dopant and its content coating technique withdrawal rate annealing temperature and number of coating applied are other crucial factors influencing the desired anode characteristics 20 70 dip coating and thermal decomposition 71 conveniently offer such advantages as simplicity low cost ease of adding doping improved growth rate and mass production capability for uniform large area coatings which are necessary for industrial applications however it is worth noting that presence of nacl or cl for eo treatment of pw could adversely affect anode characteristics while the ensuing active chlorine generation could also improves oxidation of organics 72 93 hence a deeper examination of the electrochemical oxidation mechanism could prove useful in development of this technique the main reactions of the sno2 anode may be detailed as follows 44 88 90 1 sno2 xh2o sno2 oh x xh xe 2 r sno2 oh x sno2 co2 xh xe 3 sno2 oh x sno2 x xh xe 4 r sno2 x sno2 rox where r corresponds to the organic contaminants as can be seen upon contact of water molecules with the sno2 based metal electrode physisorbed hydroxyl radicals sno2 oh x is produced at high anodic potentials 70 90 these readily react with organic substrates in the vicinity of the electrode surface to form co2 and h2o thereby removing cod by electrochemical oxidation strong interaction of the hydroxyl radical oh with the anode metal chemically absorb radicals leads to formation of higher oxide state sno2 x 21 which could further react with the organic contaminants however complete oxidation of organic contaminants expressed in eq 2 occurs much more readily compared to eq 4 18 44 it should be noted that oxygen evolution reaction always competes with the oxidation reaction of organics 19 as follows 5 sno2 oh x snox 1 1 2o2 xh xe 6 snox 2 sno1 x 1 2 o2 the reaction in eq 6 is inhibited however at higher oep this encourages reaction with organic contaminants to occur easily other electrochemical oxidation reactions also take place which do not necessarily contribute directly to the electrochemical organic oxidation at the same time the ensuing oxidative species hydroxyl free radicals ozone and chlorine will result in cod removal via chemical oxidation as follows 7 2h2o 2e h2 2oh 8 3h2o o3 6h 6e 9 2cl cl2 2e on the other hand in high saline pw chlorine is the most effective oxidant as it enhances contaminants removal by chloride evolution reaction cer below at anode 21 22 61 chlorine is produced on the anode surface and it suffers disproportionation to hypochlorous acid and hydrolysis to hypochlorite according to eqs 10 and 11 production of chlorates may also occur either electrochemically eq 12 or chemically eq 13 10 cl2 h2o hocl h cl 11 hocl 3h2o 2clo3 4 cl 12 h 3 2 o2 6e 12 cl2 6oh clo3 5cl 3h2o 13 clo clo3 2 cl the resulting active chlorine species oxidize the organics efficiently as follows 21 sno2 oh x xcl sno2 hocl x xe 14 sno2 hocl x r intermediates sno2 x co2 h2o xcl xh 15 presence of nacl in the pw do lead to formation of organochlorine compounds rcl which are readily consumed during the electrolysis 20 59 on cathode the main electrochemical reduction reactions are 16 2h2o 2e h2 2oh 17 o2 4h 4e 2h2o 18 o2 2h 2e h2o2 none of these reactions contribute directly to cod removal however hydrogen peroxide produced could contribute to cod removal 18 also oh species could encourage hydroxide formation with calcium and magnesium which exist in the pw as follows 20 ca2 hco3 oh caco3 h2o 21 mg2 2oh mg oh 2 these inorganic compounds are deposited on the cathode in salt formation and causing increased resistivity in the cell 1 3 application of the anode made from sno2 sb modified with graphene oxide on titanium substrate ti sno2 sb rgo developed in this study for eo treatment of pw is not reported in the literature yet having identified the anode characteristics based on the electrochemical tests and morphological structures performance evaluation with respect to cod removal and energy efficiency were optimized using box behnken methodology followed by a preliminary economic evaluation of the eo process proposed at the offshore platform 2 experimental 2 1

samples in a thermoreactor cr 2200 wtw 2 3 pw sampling and characterization the samples were collected from an iranian south gas field and stored at 4 c in polypropylene bottles the offshore gas platform see fig 1 consisted of the gas well production test manifolds well testing facilities free water knock out facilities condensate coaleser water treatment package and associated utilities the reservoir fluid was collected on the well head platform and routed to shore via a subsea pipeline after pw separation 3 characteristics of the two samples pw and hs pw or hydrocyclone separated are presented in table1 pw refers to the effluent accompanied with natural gas without any treatment retention degassing and de oiling process with hydrocyclones while hs pw refers to the effluent undergone hydrocyclones separation before being discharged into the sea fig 1 all eo related experiments were conducted on the hs pw and fig 3 shows the gc ms results obtained on its organic phase content 2 4 electrode preparation go was prepared by improved hummers method 62 1 0 g go was added into 200 ml deionized water and ultrasonically dispersed for 3 h 5 mg ml solution titanium plates 35 mm 42 mm 0 6 mm and 20 mm 10 mm 0 6 mm were preferred and used as substrate over tantalum 18 where they were first polished with dry grinding cloth 180 mesh and waterproof abrasive paper 500 mesh and 1000 mesh before being degreased with 5 naoh solution and soaked in 10 h2so4 for 1 h the sheets were etched in boiling hydrochloric acid 18 v v at 98 c for 15 min to provide a gray surface with uniform roughness it was then washed with deionized water and kept in 1 oxalic acid solution to prepare the precursor solution stoichiometric quantities of metal salts metal chlorides were dissolved in the alcohol solvent directly and hydrochloric acid was then added to avoid hydrolysis of metal salts here therefore a mixture of 30 ml of n butanol and 10 ml hcl containing sncl4 5h2o sbcl3 and go prepared solution was configured on titanium substrate using dip coating technique and thermochemical decomposition as suggested elsewhere 25 anodes were coated and annealed dried at 130 c for in an oven and sintered at 450 c for 15 min in a muffle furnace 15 times before being finally annealed once more for 1 h to obtain superior morphological characteristics and wear resistance 19 73 calcinations temperature plays a critical role in the anodes electrocatalytic performance if less than 450 c incomplete oxidation of tin precursor occurs leading to formation of snox 1 x 2 nanolayer and reduced band gap while high calcinations temperature may not improve anodes service life and affect adversely the thermally unstable carbon within go causing difficulties in its doping into the sno2 based composites 69 2 5 electrolytic systems the electrolytic cell used for the experiments here consisted of 150 cc cylindrical glass 4 0 cm diameter and 6 0 cm height equipped with a magnetic stirrer 200 rpm and rectangular 3 5 cm 2 5 cm electrodes stainless steel cathode having initial ph adjusted to 4 0 6 5 and 9 0 by adding the required volume of 1 m h2so4 or 1 m naoh experimental runs were designed using design expert 11 software stat ease inc 74 all experiments were conducted at room temperature using their own similar but specified anodes for comparison purposes distance between electrodes varied from 10 15 and 20 mm while the cell operated under galvanostatic conditions at cd of 10 15 and 20 ma cm2 decontamination of pw samples were monitored from the abatement of their cod as per eq 22 22 c o d r e m o v a l c o d i c o d f c o d i 100 where c o d i and c o d f refer to the initial and final cod readings mg l respectively here saline water cod measurement procedure for high chloride content was implemented 75 76 the energy efficiency ep in g kwh defined as the amount of cod removed per consumed electricity was calculated as follows 23 e p q j u t where j is the current applied during electrolysis a t hr is the electrolysis time q g is the amount of cod removed and u v is the steady state cell voltage 18 electrode stability was investigated using the accelerated life test 44 performed by anodic polarization under galvanostatic conditions at 20 ma cm2 in 0 5 m h2so4 solution the anode potential was measured as a function of time considering deactivation to occur at 10 v 44 45 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrodes electrochemical characterizations 3 1 1 cyclic voltammetry cyclic voltammetry cv tests were performed within 0 2v 0 4 v with sweep rate ranging 10 200 mv s and anodes working area of 1 0 cm2 the system was stabilized at open circuit voltage for 5 10 min prior to each measurement interestingly all nearly rectangular configuration of the cv curves fig 4 and their corresponding linear double layer charging current vs sweep rate plots indicate good charge propagation within the electrodes and confirm nonfaradaic character of the current in this potential region 62 anode capacitance is defined as the absolute value of the linear plot slope 46 and is 60 μf cm2 for smooth oxide rf the relative roughness factor of electrodes reflects the electrode real surface area relative to the apparent geometric area table 2 shows the effect of adding go nanoparticle where rf improved remarkably which translates to more favorable electrocatalytic activity number of electroactive sites determines the electrode electrocatalytic performance and depends largely on the chemical composition of its layers the voltammetric charge q calculated by the surface area under the cv curves at a specific sweep rate reflects this characteristic it decreases with increasing the potential sweep rate for both electrodes this may be attributed to hindered exchange of charged components between the electrolyte solution and electroactive sites in less accessible parts of the electrode film surface 77 the total voltammetric charge q t indicate the total electrochemically active surface area of the oxide coating and is obtained by plotting 1 q against v1 2 as per eq 24 24 1 q 1 q t kv1 2 the outer voltammetric charge q o refers to the associated charge of the most accessible electroactive surface area is calculated using the following eq 25 25 q q o kv 1 2 considering q t q o q i the inner voltammetric charge q i is evaluated fig 5 a b illustrate the plots for both ti sb sno2 and ti sb sno2 rgo electrodes where good linear correlations are fitted clearly larger q t was observed for ti sb sno2 rgo electrode indicating that go introduction significantly improved the electrochemically active surface area fig 5a the higher q o also suggests that go modified electrode provided larger number of active sites for the electrocatalytic process accessible to the exchange of charged species fig 5b table 2 presents the corresponding voltammetric charges 3 1 2 electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis measurement was employed to characterize electrochemical interfacial properties system resistance and deactivation mechanism of the doped anodes 20 ac voltage of 5 mv in amplitude over a frequency range of 100 khz to 10 mhz was applied to the system and the corresponding response current and impedance were determined as a frequency function fig 6 a demonstrates the nyquist plots obtained by eis for both which are similar in form electrodes and nearly linear the equivalent circuit was used to interpret the eis spectra fig 6b with fitting parameters in table 3 associated errors of less than 12 indicate suitability of the proposed simulative circuit for effective fitting of the experimental data rs represents the solution resistance in higher frequency region and the semicircle in high frequency region corresponds to capacitance c2 and resistance r2 the larger the semicircle the higher the charge transfer resistance signifying the electrochemical behavior of the growth of a resistive hydrated layer at the oxide solution interface 46 however electrode electrolyte interface acts as an electrochemical double layer capacitance represented by a cpe constant phase element to reflect the electrodes complex morphology 45 also at the electrode coating solution interface there is a charge exchange and compensation hence charge transfer resistance r1 is considered in parallel with the cpe cpe value for ti sb sno2 go electrode is higher than that of ti sb sno2 indicating higher specific reaction areas of the former also lower r1 value of 6 48 kω as compared to 7 69 kω for the latter indicates higher electrochemical activity attained most likely by the improved conductivity and electrocatalytic performance for charge transfer between the electrode surface and solution of the go doped electrode 3 1 3 linear sweep voltammetry as discussed before higher oep corresponds to lesser unwanted decomposition of water molecule oep was evaluated here from the linear sweep voltammetry lsv curves fig 7 at 50 mv s and scan region from 0 to 3 0 v prior to the galvanostatic experiments the electrodes underwent a pretreatment in the cell by applying 3 0 ma cm2 for 15 min to complete surface oxidization recommended for the stability of succeeding scan oep was determined at the intersection of the tangent to the curve with the e v at the horizontal axis clearly the electrode modified by doping go had a higher oep 2 20 v than ti sno2 sb 2 12 v interestingly this was higher than that of ti sno2 sb y 2 05 v 78 ti sno2 sb2o3 nb2o5 pbo2 1 80 v 79 ti tio2 nts sno2 sb2o5 1 80 v 71 and ti re sb sno2 2 10 v 80 indicating its improved electrocatalytic activity 3 2 electrode morphology 3 2 1 xrd examination xrd tests provide information on the phase purity and average crystallite sizes of the prepared electrodes considering the standard data of the pdf card numbers of 41 1445 and 29 1484 and the xrd patterns for both electrodes prepared here fig 8 the indexed peaks correspond to diffraction angles indicating both tetragonal rutile and orthorhombic structures of sno2 formation of the orthorhombic phase is most likely caused by high stresses inside the particle layer during oxidation sno2 peaks are however broader compared to the ti peaks during the reduction process of go oxygenated functional groups epoxy oh cooh and c o groups undergo deoxygenation 65 resulting in provision of a broad peak around 2θ 24 as indicated in fig 8 the broad peak reveals the low crystallinity index of rgo which has a non stacking multilayer structure due to the presence of some oxygen functional groups this could be verified further by studying ft ir spectrum regarding antimony no diffraction peak was observed within 2θ 28 32 indicating either its low content or its doping into the sno2 lattice 81 xrd patterns identified no impurity confirming the high quality of the samples investigated crystallite particle size diameter d was evaluated using the debye scherrer eq 26 26 d k λ β c o s θ where λ is the x ray radiation wavelength k is a constant taken as 0 89 β full width at half maximum height in radian and θ is the bragg angle in the diffraction xrd maximum crystallite size dmax was 26 58 nm with an average size of 20 39 nm the smaller the crystallite size the more favorable the electrochemical capability of the electrode 45 the particle size was also determined by fesem technique which confirmed the xrd results the unit cell volume was also investigated for tetragonal sno2 using bragg s formula 71 not described here for brevity the corresponding lattice parameters and the volume of the unit cell obtained were lower than the standard sno2 suggesting greater distortion caused by the introduction of sb5 ions and go into the sno2 crystal lattice leading to the reduction of bond lengths between the metal and oxygen atoms therefore as suggested elsewhere 44 46 smaller unit cell volume and crystallite size of the electrode with rgo improve its electro catalytic activity 34 also nanoparticles help refining the crystal grains and increase the specific surface area and active sites 3 2 2 fesem fig 9 a c illustrates the morphological characterization of the rgo doped electrode using a fesem micrograph at various magnifications as can be seen the sno2 crystals appear in rather uniform round clusters fig 9a with well distributed and defined grooves which seem to prevent electrolyte diffusion into its compact texture as expected by increased number of inner active site due to the presence of rgo expressed in the cv investigations fig 9c illustrates nanosized uniform particles of less than 30 nm confirming to some extent the xrd results 82 some clusters however had a cracked morphology where the exposed coating composition was investigated by eds fig 9d results endorsed presence of o sn sb ti and c elements as illustrated in peaks in fig 9e having the atom percentages of 60 65 31 68 1 67 3 05 4 01 respectively the cracks in the cluster occur most likely due to high internal pressure of the surface layer and differences in the thermal expansion coefficient of the base metal and the coating leading to poor stability and erosion 19 91 these cracks inevitably lead to electrolyte diffusion and anode deactivation in the presence of nano sized particles the consequent high surface activity leads to a small elongation deformation under tensile stress which could in turn hinder the extension of cracks formed 3 2 3 ft ir ft ir spectrum fig 10 a b identifies the main functional groups in the structure of the anodes where the effect of go doped can clearly be observed the band ranged 400 700 cm 1 and specifically at 635 cm 1 confirms the sno2 formation as it can be assigned to the antisymmetric sn o sn stretching mode of the surface bridging oxide the peaks related to graphene oxide corresponds to oh ν o h at 1563 cm 1 ranging 3200 3400 cm 1 cc ν c c at 1615 cm 1 co ν c o at 1733 cm 1 and 1717 cm 1 and co ν c o at 1274 1220 cm 1 1050 cm 1 and1052 cm 1 and c h ν c h ranging 650 cm 1 and 750 cm 1 83 84 however as expected for the peaks associated with reduced go the intensities of absorption bands of the oxygen functionalities ν o h ν c o and ν c o have been decreased considerably confirming successful reduction of go where oh peaks have shifted to the higher wavenumber and carbonyl groups have disappeared the bonds in the region of 1176 cm 1 also corresponds to different types of surface hydroxyl groups 13 the peak at 2923 78 cm 1 corresponds to ch bonding associated to the acidic production phase and hence confirms the presence of carboxylic acid in the structure 3 2 4 accelerated life test the accelerated life test was carried out for ti sb sno2 rgo electrode and was compared with that of ti sb sno2 electrode fig 11 indicates sharp potential increase during the first 50 min followed by gradual increases for the next 500 min before anode deactivation at 10 v as can be seen addition of rgo has increased the time for anode stability by 250 min or nearly 70 surface morphology of anodes could help understand their deactivation process under high current density the anode crystalline structure change irreversibly causing deactivation produced cracks on the coating allow penetration of oxygen atoms generated by water electrolysis into the ti substrate which leads to formation of an insulating tio2 layer 44 on the other hand formation of a passive hydration layer on the electrode s surface is inevitable 45 and adherence of coating layer to the surface overcomes the van der waals interaction between the sno2 molecules resulting in surface aggregates and cracks 44 hence the electrode s failure blocks the charge transfer and this leads to a potential increase 3 3 electrochemical oxidation experiments amongst several operating variables which could influence the electrochemical oxidation of pw contaminants including cd ph electrodes distance electrolyte type initial contaminant concentration and temperature the last three were not investigated in this work due to our deliberate focus on working with the real pw and associated ambient conditions in the gas offshore platform where maintain an optimum value may not be economic or practical it is worth noting that eo is inherently exothermic that temperature affects both reaction rates of organic degradation in the bulk as well as the capacity of oh adsorption on the anode surface 20 to develop the response surface in 120 min electrolysis duration three factors of current density x1 initial ph x2 and electrode distances x3 are used applying a quadratic model for the cod removal y1 and energy efficiency y2 results obtained generated in 17 runs including 5 replicates around the center point to allow for errors involved table 4 illustrates bbd design matrix and results for the effluent output post eo treatment y1 and y2 for the corresponding box behnken design were 27 y1 173 69 14 85x2 5 99x1 51 29x3 1 62x1x3 1 37x2x3 0 15x1 2 0 71x2² 8 55x3² 28 y2 148 10 9 05x2 20 18x3 8 99x1 0 14x1x2 0 71x1x3 0 37x2 2 4 27x1 2 0 18x1 2 analysis of variance anova confirms the significance of the generated model which was also tested by the fisher f test where the model terms were evaluated by the p value probability with 95 confidence level table 5 indicates that fit quality for the polynomial equations eqs 27 28 were acceptable r2 values were close to unity also predicted r 2 value were reasonably close 0 2 to the adjusted r2 fig 12 demonstrates how the results correlate in terms of the three parameters of cd ph and electrode distance in general maximum cod removal could be achieved in the lower ph higher cd and larger electrodes distance however considering both y1 and y2 simultaneously changed the optimum conditions 3 3 1 effect of current density figs 12 a c d indicate that at higher cd improved cod removal and increased oer occurred the latter translates into higher o2 diffusion into the anodes and consequently their swifter deactivation and reduced energy efficiency in this work the upper limit for eo was taken as 20 ma cm2 as higher values accelerate anodes deactivation 3 3 2 effect of initial ph electrolyte ph influences the adsorption of contaminants molecules on the electrode surface at higher ph such organic compounds as phenol polymerize into a low permeable film which sticks to the electrode surface and causes fouling 20 on the other hand the presence of ca2 and mg2 ions associated with the saline pw however promotes scaling on the cathode the redox potential for hoaq h2o couple at different ph may be described by nernst as per eq 29 29 e0 hoaq h2o 2 59 0 059 ph for ph 7 or 14 the term e0 hoaq h2o becomes 2 18 v or 1 77 v respectively hence higher oxidative potential occurs at the lower ph range however lower ph reduces the oer which tend to favor the oxidation of organic compound 44 85 86 on the other hand chlorine molecule e0 cl2 cl 1 36 v exists only in neutral or acidic solution and very low ph leads to provision of lower concentration of species like hypochlorite and hypochlorous acid that can be further oxidized at the anode to form chlorate 86 fig 12 b c indicates that y1 and y2 were improved at acidic condition 3 3 3 effect of electrodes distance as can be seen from fig 12 a b d increasing the electrode spacing from 10 to 20 mm increased y1and y2 in the high saline pw investigated here however further increase to 25 mm led to reduction of y1 and y2 improving the cod removal at 20 mm indicate better performances of oxidative agents such as chlorine generated at anodes or less destructions of these at the cathode as for the y2 the optimum electrode distance was around 10 mm at which the applied electric field strength was higher very short electrode distance on the other hand could result in short circuits caused by either direct electrode linkage or conducting impurities present in the water 18 92 3 4 optimization software optimization predicted an optimized y1 72 68 when the three independent parameters of cd ph and electrode distance were considered however taking also the energy efficiency into account this became 59 96 at cd of 10 ma cm2 ph 4 00 and electrode distance 10 mm empirically at the same operating conditions y1 58 60 was achieved with y2 42 62 g kwh which was compatible with the predicted figure of 42 83 g kwh acidic optimized condition means that no additional additive is needed for ph adjustment furthermore formations of several chlorinated organic compounds rcl were detected on the optimized run conditions fig 13 illustrates the gc ms chromatograms for feed hs pw and post eo treatment saline pw provides chlorine resulting in rcl formation 20 45 87 88 which decomposed to undetectable levels in 235 min 3 5 cod removal rate fig 14 illustrates the change in relative concentration of cod against time which could be expressed as a pseudo first order kinetic reaction presented below 30 l n c o d t c o d i k t where codi is the initial cod concentration codt indicate cod concentration at time t and k is the reaction rate constant which for ti sno2 sb rgo was 0 006 min 1 for the optimized condition the effluent output characteristics are presented in table 6 where cod removal was almost complete after 235 min 3 6 preliminary design and economic evaluation of the eo unit as shown in fig 2 the designed eo process unit is simple and inexpensive capital cost for the unit was calculated based on the system capacity equipment and required utilities 21 covering items such as electrodes pumps impellers dc electricity generator and instrumentations for a 263 m3 day pw treatment facility this was estimated to be us 0 806 million for each gas offshore platform considering the time required for 100 elimination of the contaminants and this throughput the eo unit consists of 9 atmospheric batch reactors each having a capacity of 5 95 m3 operating cost was estimated to be us 1 580 million per year of which 92 was for anodes regenerations 6 for electricity and 2 for maintenance and other contingency costs as can been seen much of the costs incurred due to anodes regeneration which corresponds to the short life span of the anodes assuming 25 years life of the eo unit the electrochemical treatment cost of pw was estimated at us 5 74 m3 this is comparable to us 6 m3 the treatment cost 22 for treating a domestic wastewater using boron doped diamond and nanostructured amorphous carbon electrodes or us 5 6 m3 deep well injection 89 the high cost of treatment can be compensated against several advantages including easy operation simple and compactness of the equipment no transportation and storage of chemicals and no handling of chemical and more importantly no environmental penalty due to 100 removal of cod contaminants and no phase transfer of the accompanied pollutions 22 4 conclusions with an aim on protecting the environment sustainably and develop at one of the world largest gas reserve in the persian gulf and faced with lack of international legislation and effective monitoring of pollutants in these sensitive waters this study has attempted to enhance the offshore treatment process of the produced water by total removal of cod pollutants from a gas field platform considering space limitations on the platform and using the existing facilities here employing an electrochemical oxidation unit immediately after hydro cyclone separation and before discharging into the sea is proposed using anode of sno2 modified with graphene oxide following a review of the anode preparation techniques sno2 was selected as the most suitable material for efficient removal of organic material from hs pw it was then modified by go and prepared by a simple dip coating and thermal decomposition technique required for practical industrial application the anode performance was investigated experimentally through comprehensive electrochemical tests reported in detail here results have indicated that introduction of rgo to sno2 provided higher electrocatalytic activity due to improved voltammetric charge and increased relative roughness factor go modified anode led to higher oxygen evolution overpotential and less energy being consumed for competitive reactions eis studies showed that go modified ti sb sno2 electrode presented lower resistivity and better charge transfer xrd and fesem results confirmed formation of sno2 nanoparticles while eds and ft ir validated presence of rgo using an rsm technique and box behnken design the optimized conditions of cd 10 ma cm2 ph 4 00 electrode distances of 10 mm predicted 59 96 cod removal and energy efficiency of 42 83 g kwh which was compatible with the experimental data of 58 60 and 42 63 g kwh respectively formations of several chlorinated organic compounds rcl were also detected on the optimized run conditions which decomposed to undetectable levels in 235 min accordingly preliminary evaluation of the eo proposed unit was carried out and based on the degradation rate of pollutants calculated treatment cost for total cod removal of the gas platform discharged water was estimated at us 5 74 per cubic meter of hs pw which is cheaper than deep well injection easy and safe to operate and monitor and hence a recommendable approach for sustainable development of gas reserves at sea funding sources this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for

14052,the malaysian palm oil industry generates large amount of palm oil mill effluent pome and carbon dioxide co2 appropriate control of this industrial discharge through biological means is essential to achieve sustainable development this study discloses the practical way of reducing pollutants in pome and fixing co2 by using three locally isolated microalgae species chlorella sorokiniana ukm2 coelastralla sp ukm4 and chlorella pyrenoidosa ukm7 the identification of the microalgal assimilable organic carbon sources in pome is first reported in this paper the microalgae strains were cultured independently in 10 v v pome aerated with 1 v v co2 throughout the process c sorokiniana ukm2 showed the highest co2 uptake rate of 567 mg l 1 day 1 and nutrient removal efficiency nre of ammonium nh4 total nitrogen tn and total phosphate tp of 100 65 and 56 respectively meanwhile coelastella sp ukm4 and c pyrenoidosa ukm7 exhibited co2 fixation rates ranging from 396 to 486 mg l 1 day 1 whereas the nre of nh4 n was 100 the nre of tn and tp ranged from 59 to 63 and 41 56 respectively both chlorella species presented higher average nutrient removal rates anrr of nh4 n tn and tp than coelastralla sp ukm4 this study indicated that these three native microalgal species possess great potential for integration into the phycoremediation of pome and co2 fixation keywords microalgae co2 uptake rate nutrient removal efficiency average nutrient removal rate 1 introduction malaysia is the world s primary producer of palm oil with annual exports worth 7 5 billion us dollars 1 malaysia produced 19 96 million tonnes of crude palm oil cpo in the year 2015 which generated between 49 75 million tonnes of palm oil mill effluent pome 1 2 pome is an agricultural wastewater with high biochemical oxygen demand bod 25 000 65 714 mg l 1 chemical oxygen demand cod 44 300 102 696 mg l 1 total solids ts 40 500 72 058 mg l 1 suspended solids ss 18 000 46 011 mg l 1

employ a substantially integrated open ponding system for treatment of pome 4 however this system produces approximately 28 m3 of biogas per tonne of pome comprising approximately 64 36 and 670 2500 ppm of methane ch4 carbon dioxide co2 and h2s respectively 5 6 furthermore the large uncontrolled amounts of ch4 contributes up to 25 times more to greenhouse gas ghg emission than co2 7 8 the ch4 combustion used for energy generation in the mills also generates excess co2 therefore palm oil mill industries in malaysia bear the burden of carbon credit to reduce ghg emission additionally the ponding process requires a long hydraulic retention time hrt of approximately 66 days which needs to be further optimized 9 more than 85 of palm oil mills operating in malaysia use ponding systems or a combination of digestive tanks and ponding systems for the treatment of pome apart from producing ghg gases pome also poses a eutrophication risk to water bodies due to its high concentration of nutrients therefore this study emphasizes the use of samples from the outlet channel of anaerobic and facultative ponds with the objective of reducing hrts for the whole treatment by increasing the efficiency of nutrient removal using microalgae the photosynthetic metabolism of microalgae makes it a potentially effective microorganism in the capture of co2 with approximately 10 50 times better co2 capture compared to terrestrial plants 10 11 co2 sequestration by microalgae in different wastewater media has been investigated by researchers 12 for example chlorella sp grown in sewage efficiently fixed co2 at a rate in the range of 471 565 mg l 1 day 1 13 14 microalgae could potentially improve pome treatment and shorten the in plant hrts due to their remarkable ability to assimilate contaminants microalgae cultivation using pome to produce biomass and perform phycoremediation has been investigated and addressed in the past few years 15 18 our previous study reported that the isolated microalgae species chlamydomonas sp ukm6 achieved a high specific growth rate of 1 353 day 1 when grown in a medium of 12 5 v v pome from the anaerobic pond whereas the removal efficiency of tn nh4 n and tp was 73 100 and 64 respectively 15 a few papers have reported co2 fixation rates via simulation 14 35 however the carbon sources used in these studies were not reported in detail failing to state whether the carbon source used was the growth media or the co2 supply to the best of our knowledge the clarification of microalgae assimilable organic carbon source is first reported in this paper in this study three microalgae isolates chlorella sorokiniana ukm2 coelastralla sp ukm4 and chlorella pyrenoidosa ukm7 isolated from pome itself were used in the phycoremediation of pome additionally their co2 fixation rates were determined in this study the activity of these three microalgae provides a promising strategy in reducing co2 and pome contaminants from the industrial stack 2 methods 2 1 microalgae isolation three different microalgae species were isolated from the 1 the outlet channel of an anaerobic pond at the sime darby palm oil mill carey

malaysia fppd sterile bold s basal medium bbm 19 20 at ph 7 was prepared for microalgae growth the microalgae colony was streaked thrice on bbm agar to isolate single colonies the single culture was maintained continuously in bbm at 25 1 c with 0 5 vvm of air sparging cultures were maintained under continuous illumination and were sub cultured every seven days 2 2 identification of microalgae species genomic dna was extracted with the dneasy plant mini kit qiagen netherlands following the manufacturer s instructions the 18s primers of ns1 5 gtagtcatatgcttgtctc 3 and ns8 5 tccgcaggttcacctacgga 3 were used for pcr amplification and sequence analysis of pcr products were conducted by sangon biotech shanghai co ltd china subsequently the sequence was analyzed by the basic local alignment search tool blast in the database of the national centre for biological information ncbi the sequence was aligned using clustalw multiple sequence alignment and the closest relatives were identified 2 3 phycoremediation of pome pome was collected from the same sampling source as the microalgae fppd appd and apci then the pome sample was filtered using grade gf c 1 2 μm whatman glass microfibers to remove suspended solids the removal of suspended solid in pome sample increased light penetration to support photosynthetic metabolism of microalgae the filtrate was autoclaved at 121 c for 20 min to kill indigenous microbes in the sample 2 4 microalgae growth in the pome with co2 a total of 200 ml of the microalgae culture was cultivated in a flask containing 1 8 l of pre treated pome the culture was kept at 25 1 c with continuous light at 20 000 lx sparging at 0 7 vvm with 1 co2 mixed with air three microalgal species isolated in the present study were independently cultured in this experimental set up microalgal biomass was measured according to the standard method 23 all of the experiments were conducted in triplicates 2 5 determination of the co2 uptake rate 2 5 1 determination of carbon in microalgae biomass the carbon content w w of the three strains in microalgal biomass was analyzed by a chns elemental analyzer thermo flashea 1112 usa 2 5 2 microalgae growth monitoring the maximum specific growth rate μmax day 1 of the microalgae was determined using the verhulst logistical model via eq 1 and eq 2 eq 2 was derived from the integration of eq 1 24 1 d x d t μ max x 1 x x max 2 x x max 1 e 2 μ max t where x mg l 1 is the biomass concentration during the present time xmax mg l 1 is the maximum biomass concentration and μmax day 1 is the maximum

according to rao et al 2009 3 p max d x d t x max μ max 4 where pmax mg l 1 day 1 is the maximum productivity of the microalgae 2 5 4 co2 uptake rate the co2 uptake rate was determined by eq 4 25 4 r

milliliters of the culture were collected at 12 h intervals and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min to harvest the microalgae biomass the supernatant was analyzed for the concentration of total nitrogen tn ammonical nitrogen nh4 n total organic carbon toc and total phosphorus tp according to the manufacturer s manual 22 the nutrient removal efficiency nre and average nutrient removal rate

bod3 tn nh4 n toc tp and turbidity which were determined using the relevant hach reagents according to the manufacturer s protocol 22 the ph was analyzed using a cyberscan ph 300 m eutech instrument the hot acid solution was prepared by a mixture of hcl and hno3at a ratio of 1 3 incubated for 60 min at 50 c prior to being used to determine the metal ion concentration a total of 5 ml of the hot acid solution was mixed with 5 ml of the pome sample then the mixture was diluted with distilled water to ph of 2 the sample was injected into agilent 7700 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms for analysis of metal ion concentration to determine the sugar content monosaccharides and disaccharides and volatile fatty acid vfas composition of pome pome samples were acidified to ph 2 using 2 m h2so4 the sample was then injected into the agilent 1100 series hplc equipped with a rozex roa column 300 7 8 mm 8 μm particle size 00h 0138 k0 using the uv vis detector at 210 nm and 100 0 005 n h2so4 was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min 1 at 40 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 microalgae isolation and identification the results of the morphological characteristics of the isolated microalgae were presented in table 1 it was observed that all microalgae species are green microalgae with ukm2 and ukm7 exhibiting similar features size around 2 4 μm and spherical in shape besides ukm4 displayed a larger oval size 10 13 μm this characteristic indicates that both ukm2 and ukm7 are similar species while ukm4 is a different species owing to its distinct features therefore the results of the sequence analysis confirmed the similarity of these strains with the others as indicated in table 2 the isolates were named chlorella sorokiniana ukm2 coelastralla sp ukm4 and chlorella pyrenoidosa ukm7 then the 18s rrna gene sequence of c sorokiniana ukm2 coelastralla sp ukm4 and c pyrenoidosa ukm7 were deposited in ncbi genbank with the accession numbers kp262476 kp691597 and kp898731 respectively 3 2 characteristics of pome the characteristics of different pome samples before and after pretreatment were compared to bold basal media bbm as indicated in table 3 in general removal of tss do not alter the characteristics of pome sample except for turbidity in addition the metal ion in the pre treated sample was also analyzed by icp ms as shown in table 4 however the metal ion was not much different among the three pre treated pome samples microalgae were cultivated in 10 v v pome for the subsequent analysis of pome phycoremediation and co2 fixation the pome samples containing significant amounts of contaminants were used as media for the microalgae in general the characteristics of nutrients in all pome samples did not differ the total nitrogen and total phosphorus were in the range of 436 506 mg l 1 and 135 174 mg l 1 respectively the high amount of total organic carbon from the anaerobic pond 645 and 535 mg l 1 for appd and apci respectively and facultative pond 225 mg l 1 for fppd were analyzed and compared 3 3 confirmation of the absence of assimilable carbon sources in pome table 3 shows that no sugars monosaccharides and disaccharides were detected from all three pome in both untreated and pre treated sample all samples were collected from the effluent of the anaerobic digester tank which indicates that all sugars were completely hydrolyzed during the anaerobic digestion process 29 30 research by jamali et al 31 proved that anaerobic digestion process reduced the total sugar content in pome up to 97 no sugars were detected in the sample which did not influence the microalgae growth in this study in this particular study pome was employed as a medium for microalgae growth the data from table 3 shows that the potentially assimilable organic carbon sources are total organic carbon toc ranging from 225 to 645 mg l 1 in all pome samples to prove that the toc values in the sample do not contribute to assimilable organic carbon sources by microalgae the experiment was conducted using a control without microalgae and with an experimental group with microalgae in the fppd sample this experiment was to ensure that co2 is the only carbon source for microalgae growth under the photoautotrophic regime to support the estimation of the co2 uptake rate fig 1 shows that the toc concentration in the control group without microalgae has a similar reduction tendency to that in the experimental group with microalgal growth the toc concentration in all of the groups declined by approximately 23 within 24 h and then became relatively stable this might be a consequence of the volatile organic compound vocs emission into the atmosphere due to the gas aeration of pome 32 it was reported that vocs were detected in the atmosphere in the palm oil mill and typical vocs from wastewater treatment contains dimethyl sulfide dimethyl disulfide carbon disulfide methyl mercaptan and ethyl mercaptan 33 34 the toc concentration drops due to volatilization of these compounds formed from carbon and sulfur molecules throughout this experiment it was observed that the assimilable carbon by microalgae is not due to toc values in fppd pome total organic carbon toc is the amount of carbon bound in an organic compound and is often used as a non specific indicator of water quality or cleanliness of pharmaceutical manufacturing equipment toc consists of non purgeable organic carbons npoc and purgeable volatile organic carbons poc pocs are also referred to as volatile organic compounds vocs which could be removed from a neutral or acidified sample by purging with an inlet gas meanwhile it can be noted that acetic acid and propionic acid were detected in appd and apci where these two organic acids are the natural product of anaerobic digestion mixotrophic microalgae species such as chlorella chlamydomonas and scenedesmus can simultaneously perform both photoautotrophic and heterotrophic metabolic activity by assimilating co2 and specific organic carbon sources 26 typical wastewater is a mixture that contains small molecules large molecules and some polymers ranging from 500 to 5000 da 27 although most of the carbon sources are available for bacteria only the relatively simple carbon molecules can be utilized by microalgae such as monosaccharides glucose and fructose disaccharides sucrose glycerol and volatile fatty acids 26 28 apart from this the concentration of the major nutrients n and p and trace metal elements were found in fppd pome sample while appd pome and apci pome shows not much different table 3 due to the optimal content of major nutrients n and p and trace metal elements as well as the absence of sugar and vfas fppd pome was selected as the culture medium in this study to indicate that the carbon assimilation by microalgae was from co2 supplementation 3 4 kinetic parameters of microalgae biomass growth and co2 fixation fig 2 shows the growth profile of c sorokiniana ukm2 coelastrella sp ukm4 and c pyrenoidosa ukm7 in fppd pome it was observed that c sorokiniana ukm2 reached the stationary growth phase on day 4 whereas the other two microalgal species took 5 or 5 5 days to plateau the microalgae of both chlorella genera c sorokiniana ukm2 and c pyrenoidosa ukm7 exhibited the highest biomass production of 1080 mg l 1 and 1072 mg l 1 respectively the growth profile of each microalgal species was fitted to the verhulst logistical model eq 2 for maximum specific growth rate μmax determination the μmax of chlorella sp ukm2 is 1 06 day 1 whereas those of the other two microalgal species range from 0 8 0 88 day 1 as indicated in table 5 additionally the fitness of the statistical results in terms of fisher f and probability p values are satisfactory for all of the set ups of microalgae growth the data fitting in this set up presented a high degree of confidence which supports the μmax derived from this kinetic model fig 3 indicates that c sorokiniana ukm2 presented the highest co2 uptake rate which was followed by c pyrenoidosa ukm7 at 567 mg l 1day 1 and 486 mg l 1day 1 respectively meanwhile coelastrella sp ukm4 exhibited lower co2 uptake rate compared to those two strains this is consistent with previous literature that the chlorella genus is an outstanding microalgal candidate for co2 fixation 37 according to eq 3 and eq 4 the co2 uptake rate depends on the carbon content of the biomass biomass production and the μmax the carbon content of the biomass of these three microalgal biomass range from 54 to 58 which are slightly higher than the 51 derived from the microalgal chemical composition formula 36 3 5 nutrient removal and ph variation microalgae require nutrients in the form of nitrogen and phosphorus for their growth and maintenance as shown in fig 4 the concentrations of nh4 n tn and tp in all of the experimental groups dropped significantly whereas the concentrations in the control group only varied over small ranges suggesting that nutrient removal is related to microalgae assimilation the ph in the control group reduced significantly from 7 0 at the initial point to approximately 6 3 at 12 h and was afterward maintained at this level fig 4 d the ph in the experimental groups with microalgae growth also decreased in the first 12 h but soon increased to the range of 6 6 7 0 and fluctuated in this range thereafter the decrease in ph in the first 12 h in all experiments indicates the formation of carbonic acid due to co2 supplementation this process releases hydrogen ions owing to the equilibrium formula of co2 h2o h2co3 h hco3 2h co3 2 photosynthetic co2 fixation by microalgae allowed the equilibrium to shift in order to replace the utilization of co2 by the microalgae the efficient photosynthetic metabolism of microalgae enhanced o2 evolution which then reacted with free hydrogen ions to form free oh radicals which in turn contributes to ph increase therefore co2 was supplied continuously in this study to ensure that the ph values did not drastically increase the concentrations of nh4 n tn and tp in the control group only varied in small margins fig 4 therefore it is correlated with the low ph below 7 0 after 12 h of incubation which affects the nh4 n tn and tp concentration fig 4 ammonium and phosphate react with water to create an equilibrium with their ionic form the ph significantly affects the balance of these equilibria the stripping of ammonia and phosphate precipitation occurs at a ph above 9 it was reported that 20 90 of ammonia volatilizes and most of the phosphorus forms calcium phosphate when the ph is elevated to the range of 9 11 however in this set up the ph was maintained at an almost constant state by a continuous co2 supply and did not result in the loss of the nutrient due to non biotic factors nh4 n is the preferred assimilable nitrogen source to support microalgae growth 38 nh4 n was rapidly and completely consumed by all four microalgal species in the experimental groups fig 4 a nevertheless the nre of tn in all of the microalgae growth has a low range of 59 65 this is due to the fact that some nitrogen molecules are combined with macromolecules that cannot be assimilated by microalgae in pome 39 it was reported from previous study that tn reduction can achieved up to 86 by microalgae 40 the nre of tp exhibited poor performance ranging from 41 to 56 in all of the experimental groups fig 5 a imeanwhile the average nutrient removal rate anrr of tp is only in the range of 2 2 3 3 mg l 1 day 1 fig 5 b the remaining tp concentration in the pome medium after microalgae growth is 12 18 mg l 1 from 135 mg l 1 table 3 this is because the tp concentration is not the limiting nutrient for microalgae growth it was suggested that nitrogen becomes limited when the n p ratio falls below 10 41 the n p ratio range of fppd pome is approximately 1 8 3 4 suggesting that only nitrogen limits the microalgae growth in this study while phosphorus does not have significant effects on microalgae growth typically tp seldom limits microalgae growth due to the typical n p ratio in wastewater 42 4 conclusion the newly green microalgal strains of c sorokiniana ukm2 coelastrella sp ukm 4 and c pyrenoidosa ukm7 were isolated and identified in this study these three microalgal species have the potential to grow in pome fix co2 and phycoremediate nutrients in pome among these three species c sorokiniana ukm2 achieved a maximum co2 uptake rate of 567 mg l 1day 1 and the highest nre of nh4 n tn and tp of the microalgae was 100 65 and 56 respectively both c sorokiniana ukm2 and c pyrenoidosa ukm7 exhibited a relatively higher anrr than coelastrella sp ukm4 fppd pome has the potential to support microalgal co2 fixation due to its sufficient nutrient content the absence of soluble carbon sources in fppd pome allowed the microalgae to consume co2 and generate clear co2 uptake rate therefore the isolated microalgae strains are pollutant tolerant which is effective in reducing atmospheric co2 and the enhancement of the phycoremediation of pome this study will contribute to increasing the treatment efficiency and reducing the total hrt in industries to eliminate interference of microalgal assimilable organic carbon sources this research determined the saccharide and vfa content in the pome providing an approach to generate accurate results of co2 fixation rates by microalgae however different effluent characteristics and higher co2 concentration released by the industries may become the limitation of this method thus robust microalgae have to adapt to the effluent characteristics and co2 concentration for better remediation efficiency declaration of

14052,the malaysian palm oil industry generates large amount of palm oil mill effluent pome and carbon dioxide co2 appropriate control of this industrial discharge through biological means is essential to achieve sustainable development this study discloses the practical way of reducing pollutants in pome and fixing co2 by using three locally isolated microalgae species chlorella sorokiniana ukm2 coelastralla sp ukm4 and chlorella pyrenoidosa ukm7 the identification of the microalgal assimilable organic carbon sources in pome is first reported in this paper the microalgae strains were cultured independently in 10 v v pome aerated with 1 v v co2 throughout the process c sorokiniana ukm2 showed the highest co2 uptake rate of 567 mg l 1 day 1 and nutrient removal efficiency nre of ammonium nh4 total nitrogen tn and total phosphate tp of 100 65 and 56 respectively meanwhile coelastella sp ukm4 and c pyrenoidosa ukm7 exhibited co2 fixation rates ranging from 396 to 486 mg l 1 day 1 whereas the nre of nh4 n was 100 the nre of tn and tp ranged from 59 to 63 and 41 56 respectively both chlorella species presented higher average nutrient removal rates anrr of nh4 n tn and tp than coelastralla sp ukm4 this study indicated that these three native microalgal species possess great potential for integration into the phycoremediation of pome and co2 fixation keywords microalgae co2 uptake rate nutrient removal efficiency average nutrient removal rate 1 introduction malaysia is the world s primary producer of palm oil with annual exports worth 7 5 billion us dollars 1 malaysia produced 19 96 million tonnes of crude palm oil cpo in the year 2015 which generated between 49 75 million tonnes of palm oil mill effluent pome 1 2 pome is an agricultural wastewater with high biochemical oxygen demand bod 25 000 65 714 mg l 1 chemical oxygen demand cod 44 300 102 696 mg l 1 total solids ts 40 500 72 058 mg l 1 suspended solids ss 18 000 46 011 mg l 1

employ a substantially integrated open ponding system for treatment of pome 4 however this system produces approximately 28 m3 of biogas per tonne of pome comprising approximately 64 36 and 670 2500 ppm of methane ch4 carbon dioxide co2 and h2s respectively 5 6 furthermore the large uncontrolled amounts of ch4 contributes up to 25 times more to greenhouse gas ghg emission than co2 7 8 the ch4 combustion used for energy generation in the mills also generates excess co2 therefore palm oil mill industries in malaysia bear the burden of carbon credit to reduce ghg emission additionally the ponding process requires a long hydraulic retention time hrt of approximately 66 days which needs to be further optimized 9 more than 85 of palm oil mills operating in malaysia use ponding systems or a combination of digestive tanks and ponding systems for the treatment of pome apart from producing ghg gases pome also poses a eutrophication risk to water bodies due to its high concentration of nutrients therefore this study emphasizes the use of samples from the outlet channel of anaerobic and facultative ponds with the objective of reducing hrts for the whole treatment by increasing the efficiency of nutrient removal using microalgae the photosynthetic metabolism of microalgae makes it a potentially effective microorganism in the capture of co2 with approximately 10 50 times better co2 capture compared to terrestrial plants 10 11 co2 sequestration by microalgae in different wastewater media has been investigated by researchers 12 for example chlorella sp grown in sewage efficiently fixed co2 at a rate in the range of 471 565 mg l 1 day 1 13 14 microalgae could potentially improve pome treatment and shorten the in plant hrts due to their remarkable ability to assimilate contaminants microalgae cultivation using pome to produce biomass and perform phycoremediation has been investigated and addressed in the past few years 15 18 our previous study reported that the isolated microalgae species chlamydomonas sp ukm6 achieved a high specific growth rate of 1 353 day 1 when grown in a medium of 12 5 v v pome from the anaerobic pond whereas the removal efficiency of tn nh4 n and tp was 73 100 and 64 respectively 15 a few papers have reported co2 fixation rates via simulation 14 35 however the carbon sources used in these studies were not reported in detail failing to state whether the carbon source used was the growth media or the co2 supply to the best of our knowledge the clarification of microalgae assimilable organic carbon source is first reported in this paper in this study three microalgae isolates chlorella sorokiniana ukm2 coelastralla sp ukm4 and chlorella pyrenoidosa ukm7 isolated from pome itself were used in the phycoremediation of pome additionally their co2 fixation rates were determined in this study the activity of these three microalgae provides a promising strategy in reducing co2 and pome contaminants from the industrial stack 2 methods 2 1 microalgae isolation three different microalgae species were isolated from the 1 the outlet channel of an anaerobic pond at the sime darby palm oil mill carey

malaysia fppd sterile bold s basal medium bbm 19 20 at ph 7 was prepared for microalgae growth the microalgae colony was streaked thrice on bbm agar to isolate single colonies the single culture was maintained continuously in bbm at 25 1 c with 0 5 vvm of air sparging cultures were maintained under continuous illumination and were sub cultured every seven days 2 2 identification of microalgae species genomic dna was extracted with the dneasy plant mini kit qiagen netherlands following the manufacturer s instructions the 18s primers of ns1 5 gtagtcatatgcttgtctc 3 and ns8 5 tccgcaggttcacctacgga 3 were used for pcr amplification and sequence analysis of pcr products were conducted by sangon biotech shanghai co ltd china subsequently the sequence was analyzed by the basic local alignment search tool blast in the database of the national centre for biological information ncbi the sequence was aligned using clustalw multiple sequence alignment and the closest relatives were identified 2 3 phycoremediation of pome pome was collected from the same sampling source as the microalgae fppd appd and apci then the pome sample was filtered using grade gf c 1 2 μm whatman glass microfibers to remove suspended solids the removal of suspended solid in pome sample increased light penetration to support photosynthetic metabolism of microalgae the filtrate was autoclaved at 121 c for 20 min to kill indigenous microbes in the sample 2 4 microalgae growth in the pome with co2 a total of 200 ml of the microalgae culture was cultivated in a flask containing 1 8 l of pre treated pome the culture was kept at 25 1 c with continuous light at 20 000 lx sparging at 0 7 vvm with 1 co2 mixed with air three microalgal species isolated in the present study were independently cultured in this experimental set up microalgal biomass was measured according to the standard method 23 all of the experiments were conducted in triplicates 2 5 determination of the co2 uptake rate 2 5 1 determination of carbon in microalgae biomass the carbon content w w of the three strains in microalgal biomass was analyzed by a chns elemental analyzer thermo flashea 1112 usa 2 5 2 microalgae growth monitoring the maximum specific growth rate μmax day 1 of the microalgae was determined using the verhulst logistical model via eq 1 and eq 2 eq 2 was derived from the integration of eq 1 24 1 d x d t μ max x 1 x x max 2 x x max 1 e 2 μ max t where x mg l 1 is the biomass concentration during the present time xmax mg l 1 is the maximum biomass concentration and μmax day 1 is the maximum

according to rao et al 2009 3 p max d x d t x max μ max 4 where pmax mg l 1 day 1 is the maximum productivity of the microalgae 2 5 4 co2 uptake rate the co2 uptake rate was determined by eq 4 25 4 r c o 2 c c p max m c o 2 m c where cc is the carbon content of the microalgal cells w w mco2 is the molar mass of co2 g mol 1 and mc is the molar mass of carbon g mol 1 2 6 nutrient removal ten milliliters of the culture were collected at 12 h intervals and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min to harvest the microalgae biomass the supernatant was analyzed for the concentration of total nitrogen tn ammonical nitrogen nh4 n total organic carbon toc and total phosphorus tp according to the manufacturer s manual 22 the nutrient removal efficiency nre and average nutrient removal rate anrr mg l 1 day 1 were calculated using eq 5 and eq 6 respectively 5 nre c 0 c t c 0 6 anrr c 0 c t t t 0 where c0 is the initial concentration of each nutrient mg l 1 ct is the concentration of each nutrient in the time course mg l 1 and t0 is the starting time of the culture 2 7 analytical method the pre treated pomes were characterized for its chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod3 tn nh4 n toc tp and turbidity which were determined using the relevant hach reagents according to the manufacturer s protocol 22 the ph was analyzed using a cyberscan ph 300 m eutech instrument the hot acid solution was prepared by a mixture of hcl and hno3at a ratio of 1 3 incubated for 60 min at 50 c prior to being used to determine the metal ion concentration a total of 5 ml of the hot acid solution was mixed with 5 ml of the pome sample then the mixture was diluted with distilled water to ph of 2 the sample was injected into agilent 7700 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms for analysis of metal ion concentration to determine the sugar content monosaccharides and disaccharides and volatile fatty acid vfas composition of pome pome samples were acidified to ph 2 using 2 m h2so4 the sample was then injected into the agilent 1100 series hplc equipped with a rozex roa column 300 7 8 mm 8 μm particle size 00h 0138 k0 using the uv vis detector at 210 nm and 100 0 005 n h2so4 was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min 1 at 40 c 3 results and discussion 3 1 microalgae isolation and identification the results of the morphological characteristics of the isolated microalgae were presented in table 1 it was observed that all microalgae species are green microalgae with ukm2 and ukm7 exhibiting similar features size around 2 4 μm and spherical in shape besides ukm4 displayed a larger oval size 10 13 μm this characteristic indicates that both ukm2 and ukm7 are similar species while ukm4 is a different species owing to its distinct features therefore the results of the sequence analysis confirmed the similarity of these strains with the others as indicated in table 2 the isolates were named chlorella sorokiniana ukm2 coelastralla sp ukm4 and chlorella pyrenoidosa ukm7 then the 18s rrna gene sequence of c sorokiniana ukm2 coelastralla sp ukm4 and c pyrenoidosa ukm7 were deposited in ncbi genbank with the accession numbers kp262476 kp691597 and kp898731 respectively 3 2 characteristics of pome the characteristics of different pome samples before and after pretreatment were compared to bold basal media bbm as indicated in table 3 in general removal of tss do not alter the characteristics of pome sample except for turbidity in addition the metal ion in the pre treated sample was also analyzed by icp ms as shown in table 4 however the metal ion was not much different among the three pre treated pome samples microalgae were cultivated in 10 v v pome for the subsequent analysis of pome phycoremediation and co2 fixation the pome samples containing significant amounts of contaminants were used as media for the microalgae in general the characteristics of nutrients in all pome samples did not differ the total nitrogen and total phosphorus were in the range of 436 506 mg l 1 and 135 174 mg l 1 respectively the high amount of total organic carbon from the anaerobic pond 645 and 535 mg l 1 for appd and apci respectively and facultative pond 225 mg l 1 for fppd were analyzed and compared 3 3 confirmation of the absence of assimilable carbon sources in pome table 3 shows that no sugars monosaccharides and disaccharides were detected from all three pome in both untreated and pre treated sample all samples were collected from the effluent of the anaerobic digester tank which indicates that all sugars were completely hydrolyzed during the anaerobic digestion process 29 30 research by jamali et al 31 proved that anaerobic digestion process reduced the total sugar content in pome up to 97 no sugars were detected in the sample which did not influence the microalgae growth in this study in this particular study pome was employed as a medium for microalgae growth the data from table 3 shows that the potentially assimilable organic carbon sources are total organic carbon toc ranging from 225 to 645 mg l 1 in all pome samples to prove that the toc values in the sample do not contribute to assimilable organic carbon sources by microalgae the experiment was conducted using a control without microalgae and with an experimental group with microalgae in the fppd sample this experiment was to ensure that co2 is the only carbon source for microalgae growth under the photoautotrophic regime to support the estimation of the co2 uptake rate fig 1 shows that the toc concentration in the control group without microalgae has a similar reduction tendency to that in the experimental group with microalgal growth the toc concentration in all of the groups declined by approximately 23 within 24 h and then became relatively stable this might be a consequence of the volatile organic compound vocs emission into the atmosphere due to the gas aeration of pome 32 it was reported that vocs were detected in the atmosphere in the palm oil mill and typical vocs from wastewater treatment contains dimethyl sulfide dimethyl disulfide carbon disulfide methyl mercaptan and ethyl mercaptan 33 34 the toc concentration drops due to volatilization of these compounds formed from carbon and sulfur molecules throughout this experiment it was observed that the assimilable carbon by microalgae is not due to toc values in fppd pome total organic carbon toc is the amount of carbon bound in an organic compound and is often used as a non specific indicator of water quality or cleanliness of pharmaceutical manufacturing equipment toc consists of non purgeable organic carbons npoc and purgeable volatile organic carbons poc pocs are also referred to as volatile organic compounds vocs which could be removed from a neutral or acidified sample by purging with an inlet gas meanwhile it can be noted that acetic acid and propionic acid were detected in appd and apci where these two organic acids are the natural product of anaerobic digestion mixotrophic microalgae species such as chlorella chlamydomonas and scenedesmus can simultaneously perform both photoautotrophic and heterotrophic metabolic activity by assimilating co2 and specific organic carbon sources 26 typical wastewater is a mixture that contains small molecules large molecules and some polymers ranging from 500 to 5000 da 27 although most of the carbon sources are available for bacteria only the relatively simple carbon molecules can be utilized by microalgae such as monosaccharides glucose and fructose disaccharides sucrose glycerol and volatile fatty acids 26 28 apart from this the concentration of the major nutrients n and p and trace metal elements were found in fppd pome sample while appd pome and apci pome shows not much different table 3 due to the optimal content of major nutrients n and p and trace metal elements as well as the absence of sugar and vfas fppd pome was selected as the culture medium in this study to indicate that the carbon assimilation by microalgae was from co2 supplementation 3 4 kinetic parameters of microalgae biomass growth and co2 fixation fig 2 shows the growth profile of c sorokiniana ukm2 coelastrella sp ukm4 and c pyrenoidosa ukm7 in fppd pome it was observed that c sorokiniana ukm2 reached the stationary growth phase on day 4 whereas the other two microalgal species took 5 or 5 5 days to plateau the microalgae of both chlorella genera c sorokiniana ukm2 and c pyrenoidosa ukm7 exhibited the highest biomass production of 1080 mg l 1 and 1072 mg l 1 respectively the growth profile of each microalgal species was fitted to the verhulst logistical model eq 2 for maximum specific growth rate μmax determination the μmax of chlorella sp ukm2 is 1 06 day 1 whereas those of the other two microalgal species range from 0 8 0 88 day 1 as indicated in table 5 additionally the fitness of the statistical results in terms of fisher f and probability p values are satisfactory for all of the set ups of microalgae growth the data fitting in this set up presented a high degree of confidence which supports the μmax derived from this kinetic model fig 3 indicates that c sorokiniana ukm2 presented the highest co2 uptake rate which was followed by c pyrenoidosa ukm7 at 567 mg l 1day 1 and 486 mg l 1day 1 respectively meanwhile coelastrella sp ukm4 exhibited lower co2 uptake rate compared to those two strains this is consistent with previous literature that the chlorella genus is an outstanding microalgal candidate for co2 fixation 37 according to eq 3 and eq 4 the co2 uptake rate depends on the carbon content of the biomass biomass production and the μmax the carbon content of the biomass of these three microalgal biomass range from 54 to 58 which are slightly higher than the 51 derived from the microalgal chemical composition formula 36 3 5 nutrient removal and ph variation microalgae require nutrients in the form of nitrogen and

14053,in a previous study we used a sol hydrothermal method with a one stage calcination in an air atmosphere at 400 c to prepare composites of bi2o3 tio2 supported on powdered activated carbon bi ti pac 1 however the photocatalytic efficiency of those composites was relatively low due to their high band gap and the single crystal phase of their tio2 to improve the photocatalytic efficiency we developed a two stage calcination method with a first calcination in air at 300 c followed by a second calcination in a n2 atmosphere at 500 600 or 700 c to form the bi2o3 tio2 composites bi ti pac 2 compared with bi ti pac 1 the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of sulfamethazine smt by bi ti pac 2 700 increased by 32 under solar light irradiation bi ti pac 2 700 contained two tio2 crystal phases rutile and anatase and its band gap was 2 58 ev far less than that of bi ti pac 1 electron paramagnetic resonance measurements and trapping experiments showed that the superoxide radical hole and hydroxyl radical each played an important role in the degradation of smt among which the superoxide radical predominated the degradation pathway of smt included four processes oxidation of hydroxyl radical so2 extrusion nc and sn bond cleavage we also determined that solution ph humic acid and inorganic ions had varying effects on the photocatalytic degradation capability of bi ti pac 2 700 we measured the efficiency of bi ti pac 2 700 for smt degradation in natural river and lake water and found it to be 85 sufficient for practical applications this study provides a green and efficient photocatalyst that can be applied to water treatment processes keywords solar light irradiation sulfamethazine photocatalysis degradation pathway 1 introduction sulfamethazine smt is one of the most widely used synthetic antibiotics and has high hydrophilicity good stability and low cost 1 it can prevent animal diseases promote body growth interfere with the synthesis of folic acid and inhibit the growth and reproduction of bacteria 2 however when smt enters the environment it will cause drug resistance in pathogenic bacteria induce antibiotic resistance genes in food animals and cause extremely serious harm to aquatic organisms in the environment and adversely impact human health 3 therefore a technology that can effectively degrade it is urgently needed at present biodegradation membrane filtration physical adsorption and other technologies have been widely studied to remove smt from water 4 these approaches have the disadvantages of high energy consumption high operation and maintenance cost low treatment efficiency and secondary pollution 5 7 advanced oxidation processes aops such as fenton s reaction electrocatalysis photocatalysis and ozone oxidation have also been widely studied for degradation of smt 8 among them titanium dioxide tio2 photocatalysis is widely used to degrade sulfonamide antibiotics and other organic pollutants in water due to its low cost stable physicochemical properties non toxicity non selectivity easy operation and lack of secondary pollution 9 there are two major limitations in the practical application of tio2 its difficulty of separation from water and its low utilization efficiency of visible light 10 many researchers use semiconductor composite technology metal and non metal ion doped technology to reduce the band gap energy of semiconductor extended the electron and hole survival time and the spectral absorption region 11 14 the development of photocatalysts with supporting materials was also a focus of current research some researchers used g c3n4 and carbon nanotubes as carriers to develop new photocatalysts to improve photocatalytic activity 15 19 jessl et al 20 used honeycomb carbon nanotubes to load bivo4 enabling it to act as an electrode for solar photolysis of water enamul et al 21 studied the preparation of nanostructured graphene organic framework which can be used as a new generation of materials in electronic devices drug carriers and other fields basavarajappa et al 22 prepared gd3 substituted bismuth ferrite bf photocatalyst by sol gel method and studied the effect of gd3 substitution on the structure optical and surface properties of gd3 substituted bf nanoparticles therefore we decided to also develop a novel photocatalytic material with high activity to address the shortcomings of tio2 to solve the first problem activated carbon can be used to support tio2 because of its numerous advantages including its prevalent use in the treatment of drinking water and sewage its ability to absorb various organic pollutants in water and its variety of particle sizes and shapes 23 to address the second limitation many researchers have found that tio2 can be doped with bismuth oxide bi2o3 to improve its ability to respond to visible light 24 in a previous study we constructed a bi doped tio2 composite supported on powdered activated carbon which could photocatalytically degrade smt under visible light and had a good adsorption capacity 25 however due to its low photocatalytic efficiency it was necessary to increase the dosage of photocatalyst 1 0 g l and visible light irradiation time 300 min to achieve a degradation efficiency of smt of 80 so it was not conducive to immediate practical application the band gap energy and the crystal phase of tio2 can determine the photocatalytic efficiency of a composite 26 tio2 supported on activated carbon can reduce the band gap of the catalyst making it easier for photo induced electrons and holes to be separated thus improving its photocatalytic efficiency 27 28 additionally it has been reported that increasing calcination temperature can promote the transformation of tio2 from the anatase phase to the rutile phase and the photocatalytic effect can be improved when the two kinds of tio2 phases exist simultaneously 29 however in our previous studies in order to not only ensure the formation of tio2 and bi2o3 in the photocatalyst but also ensure that there was not a large loss of activated carbon the catalyst was calcined at 400 c in an air atmosphere if the calcination temperature exceeded 400 c an excessive amount of activated carbon would be lost here we improved the preparation by using a two stage calcination process yielding a series of bi doped tio2 composites supported by activated carbon with a low band gap and a mixed rutile anatase phase the first stage calcination occurred at 300 c in an air atmosphere which not only formed the tio2 and bi2o3 but also avoided the loss of activated carbon the second stage calcination was at a higher temperature 500 600 and 700 c under a n2 atmosphere to promote the transformation of the anatase phase and the growth of the rutile phase we compared the smt degradation capability of this series of photocatalysts to similar materials generated with a single stage calcination 400 c in air process we also analyzed effect of calcination temperature water quality parameters and repeat cycles on the ability of the two stage composites to degrade smt finally we analyzed the photocatalytic mechanism intermediate products and

industrial corporation shanghai china methyl alcohol hplc grade was obtained from fisher scientific usa 2 2 synthesis of composite based on the results from our previous study 25 the composites were fabricated to have a 1 10 bi ti molar ratio the general process consisted of combining a ti solution solution a with a bi solution solution b solution a was prepared by slowly pouring 10 ml ti obu 4

was then dripped into solution a then 0 5 g pac was added while mixing by magnetic stirring and the stirring was continued for 5 h the resulting sol was transferred into a teflon container inside a stainless steel autoclave reactor a hydrothermal treatment was conducted at 150 c for 12 h the obtained precipitates were dried at 125 c and calcined in two stages in the first stage the composite was calcined for 2 h at 300 c in an air atmosphere and in the second stage the composite was calcined at 500 600 or 700 c in a n2 atmosphere the final composite was named bi ti pac 2 x whereby x denotes

plexiglas container which was surrounded by a water cooling device before each photocatalytic reaction dark adsorption was performed for 30 min to ensure that the catalyst reached adsorption equilibrium the samples were collected at different time intervals and filtered through 0 22 μm syringe filters bhlm china to determine factors that influenced the photocatalytic degradation the solution ph was adjusted to 3 5 7 9 and 11 by the addition of 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh the humic acid concentrations used were 0 5 2 and 5 mg l and the inorganic ion concentrations were 0 5 2 and 5 mm the trapping experiment conditions were similar to those of the photocatalytic degradation tests disodium ethylene diamine tetra acetate benzoquinone and isopropanol were used as the trapping agents of h o2 and oh respectively before the experiments the trapping agent concentration was set to 0 5 2 or 5 mm the kinetics of photocatalytic degradation with the bi ti pac 2 x composites followed a

to investigate reaction oxidation species epr spectra were collected at ambient temperature 25 c in duplicate or triplicate on a jeol jes fa200 electron spin resonance spectrometer 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of bi ti pac composites the average crystal size of bi ti pac 2 700 estimated using scherrer s formula was 48 0 nm which was larger than the crystal size of bi ti pac 2 600 36 6 nm and that of bi ti pac 2 500 14 8 nm these results show that the calcination temperature had a large effect on the crystallinity of the nanoparticles and the increase of calcination temperature was conducive to crystal growth 30 31 however the bet surface area and pore volume of the prepared catalyst decreased slightly with the increase of calcination temperature the decreases were caused by two factors first the higher calcination temperature increased the crystal phase of tio2 and bi2o3 thus reducing the specific surface area of the bi ti pac 2 700 composite second tio2 and bi2o3 crystals were deposited into the pac pores of the composite 32 according to the iupac classification bi ti pac 2 700 displayed a type iv isotherm fig s1 a furthermore as displayed in table s1 the pore size of the various as synthesized bi ti pac 2 x were all 8 9 nm which fell in the scope of mesoporous pore size 2 50 nm the isotherms of bi ti pac 2 700 fig s1 b presented h1 type hysteresis loops another indication that the prepared composite had a mesoporous structure 33 34 additionally the band gap of the bi ti pac 2 700 was 2 58 ev calculated from a plot of αhν 1 2 versus the photo energy hν the band gap of bi ti pac 2 700 was smaller than that of the other two composites indicating that it was easier to transfer photogenerated electrons and holes 24 the xrd patterns of bi ti pac 2 500 bi ti pac 2 600 and bi ti pac 2 700 are shown in fig 1 the diffraction peaks in bi ti pac 2 500 can be assigned to the anatase phase of tio2 and to bi2o3 the diffraction peak at 27 2 corresponded to the 111 crystal plane of bi2o3 jcpds no 74 1633 and those at 25 3 37 8 38 6 48 0 53 8 and 62 1 corresponded to the 101 004 112 200 105 and 213 crystal planes of anatase tio2 respectively jcpds no 71 1166 furthermore when the second stage calcination temperature was 600 or 700 c the diffraction peaks not only showed the above two crystal phases but also revealed the rutile crystal phase of tio2 for bi ti pac 2 600 or bi ti pac 2 700 the diffraction peaks at 27 2 38 8 40 7 44 5 57 2 and 64 8 corresponded to the 110 200 111 210 220 and 310 planes of rutile tio2 jcpds no 76 0323 and 88 1173 in addition the diffraction peak height and sharpness of bi ti pac 2 700 were higher than those of the other two catalysts indicating that its crystallinity was the highest fig 2 shows the surface morphology and microscopic lattice of bi ti pac 2 700 from fig 2 a it can be seen that the photocatalyst was composed mostly of the pac in a terraced structure and the carbon holes on the surface were clearly visible the particles of tio2 of different sizes were spherical or irregularly agglomerated on the surface of the pac and there were fine bi2o3 particles accumulated or attached to the surface of tio2 in addition the corresponding eds spectra fig 2 b of bi ti pac 2 700 showed the existence of all elements c o ti and bi in the composite the surface morphology of bi ti pac 2 700 along with eds elemental mapping showed that bi ti and o were distributed rather evenly over the c surface fig 2 c further confirming the successful preparation of the bi ti pac 2 700 composite as seen in the tem image fig 2 d the c in the composite was amorphous while the tio2 crystal was homogeneous and dense from fig 2 e we concluded that the anatase and rutile phases of the tio2 nanoparticles were reasonably well anchored on the surface of the pac the d spacing of 0 352 nm from 3 52 10 0 352 nm in the lattice fringes corresponded to the 101 plane of anatase tio2 jcpds no 71 1166 in addition the d spacing of 0 171 nm from 1 71 10 0 171 nm in the lattice fringes corresponded to the 211 plane of rutile tio2 jcpds no 76 0323 furthermore the selected area electron diffraction saed images fig s3 also confirmed the presence of the anatase rutile mixture in the composite which was consistent with the results obtained with xrd the chemical composition and valence states of bi ti pac 2 700 was analyzed with xps there were two strong peaks in the high resolution xps spectrum at 158 6 and 163 9 ev fig 3 a belonging to bi4f7 2 and bi4f5 2 respectively the results were consistent with the xps spectra of pure bi2o3 35 indicating that the valence state of the bi cation in the composite was 3 36 in the high resolution spectrum of ti fig 3b the peaks at 464 6 and 458 9 ev corresponded ti2p1 2 and ti2p3 2 respectively the binding energy difference between the two peaks was 5 7 ev indicating that the valence state of ti was 4 24 37 in addition no peaks corresponding to ti3 and ti2 were found in the spectrum 23 the peak at 532 9 ev was attributed to the oxygen atoms in hydroxyl and ether groups in the pac 23 while the ti o ti linkages could be associated with the observed o 1s peak at 530 2 ev 27 fig 3 c d it can be seen from fig 3 d that the c1 s spectra can be fitted with four peaks the first peak detected at 283 7 ev was attributed to carboxylic acid group 27 the second peak with a binding energy of 284 6 ev was assigned to carbon atoms in cc and ch groups the third 286 0 ev and fourth 288 6 ev peaks corresponded to carbon atoms bonded to oxygen atoms co co or oco 26 in summary the coexistence of tio2 bi2o3 and c in the bi ti pac 2 700 was demonstrated by xps which was in agreement with the eds analysis 3 2 photocatalytic degradation performances in order to select the composite with the best photocatalytic performance the efficiency of photocatalytic degradation of smt by bi ti pac 2 x composites prepared at different second stage calcination temperatures were evaluated as shown in fig 4 a when the solar light irradiation time was 120 min the degradation efficiency of smt by the bi ti pac 2 x composites with calcination temperatures of 700 600 and 500 c was 100 88 and 91 respectively with the increase of calcination temperature the photocatalytic efficiency did not increase or decrease linearly but coincided with the trend of semiconductor bandgap width of the three composites in section 3 1 this phenomenon indicated that the second stage calcination temperature was a main factor in determining the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of the bi ti pac 2 x composites the effect of calcination temperature on photocatalytic degradation efficiency was due in large part to the significant influence of the calcination temperature on the band gap the process of photocatalytic degradation of smt by bi ti pac 2 500 bi ti pac 2 600 and bi ti pac 2 700 all obeyed first order kinetic models with kinetic constants of 0 02072 0 01751 and 0 02905 min 1 respectively the photocatalytic degradation rate of smt by bi ti pac 2 700 was higher than that of the other two catalysts therefore bi ti pac 2 700 was selected as the photocatalyst for further smt degradation experiments in this study the efficiency of the bi ti pac 1 and the bi ti pac 2 700 composites were evaluated under the same conditions fig s6 when the photocatalytic experiment was carried out for 120 min the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of bi ti pac 1 was only 68 far lower than that of bi ti pac 2 700 compared with the bi ti pac 2 700 composite the xrd peak intensity of bi ti pac 1 was obviously weak indicative of poor formation of each crystal phase from fig s7 moreover the tio2 in bi ti pac 1 was only in its anatase phase and its photocatalytic effect was lower than that of the photocatalyst containing tio2 with a mixed rutile anatase phase in addition as shown in fig s8 the band gap of bi ti pac 2 700 was less than that of bi ti pac 1 which made it easier for bi ti pac 2 700 to use photons to improve photocatalytic efficiency furthermore the photocatalytic degradation efficiency and adsorption capacity of bi ti pac 2 700 were significantly higher than that of p25 as shown in the fig s9 3 3 photocatalytic degradation mechanism in general the photocatalytic degradation process of semiconductor catalysts can be summarized into the following steps first under light irradiation with sufficient energy electrons in the valence band of the semiconductor absorb photons and then transition to the conduction band along with photo induced holes generated on the valence band subsequently photoinduced electrons located in the conduction band react with dissolved oxygen in water to produce o2 which generates oh through a series of subsequent reactions at the same time the photoinduced holes h in the valence band react with water to form oh these oh o2 h and other reactive species produced by the light irradiation can directly degrade organic pollutants that are sensitive to free radicals 38 39 in order to investigate the photocatalytic degradation mechanism of smt by bi ti pac 2 700 composite we used epr measurements and trapping experiments as shown in fig 5 the signal of dmpo o2 and dmpo oh were not detected in the absence of light as shown in fig 5 a b however after solar light irradiation for 20 s a strong special spectrum with a peak intensity ratio of 1 1 1 1 was observed which could be assigned to the dmpo o2 adduct 40 additionally a four line spectrum with an intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 was also obtained which was characteristic of the dmpo oh adduct 41 the results indicated that o2 and oh were produced in the photocatalytic degradation of smt by the bi ti pac 2 700 composite in order to explore the role of h o2 and oh in the photocatalytic degradation of smt a trapping test was used to determine the degree of action of the reactive species fig 5 c the degree of inhibition of the three trapping agents on the photocatalytic reaction could reflect the role of the corresponding reactive oxygen species in the photocatalytic degradation of smt 42 43 it was observed that all three trapping agents could inhibit the photocatalytic degradation of smt by bi ti pac 2 700 and the degree of inhibition increased with the dosage of the trapping agent the results showed that oh h and o2 all played an important role in bi ti pac 2 700 composite photocatalytic reaction and their relative importance was o2 h oh from this we can infer that pac bi2o3 and tio2 played a synergistic role in the degradation of smt in the prepared bi ti pac 2 700 nanocomposite at the beginning of the reaction a lot of smt by activated carbon adsorption to the surface of a composite material when the solar light was irradiated the e from the valence band of tio2 migrated to the conduction band the valence band formed the h because of the potential difference bi2o3 and tio2 the e in the tio2 conduction band migrated to bi2o3 similarly the h in the valence of bi2o3 migrated to tio2 thus the survival time of photogenic e and h was prolonged the h and e then undergo a series of reactions to generate oh and o2 fig 6 was reaction schematic as shown in the supplementary materials 3 4 optimization of influencing factors 3 4 1 effect of initial ph the initial ph of the solution was adjusted to 3 5 7 9 and 11 respectively to evaluate the effect of ph on the degradation of smt by bi ti pac 2 700 as shown in fig 7 with the increase of the initial ph value of the solution the photocatalytic degradation efficiency increased from 92 to 100 fig 7a however the results of fitting a first order kinetic model of photocatalytic degradation showed that the rate of increase of degradation reached a maximum at ph 9 when ph 9 in the initial solution the degradation rate gradually increased with the increase of ph while when ph 9 the degradation rate decreased fig 7b and table s2 there are several reasons for this result first in the photocatalytic reaction photo induced electrons e will first react with dissolved oxygen in water to produce the superoxide radical o2 eq 2 and then o2 will react with hydrogen ions h and electrons to produce h2o2 eq 3 finally h2o2 reacts with electrons to produce hydroxyl radical oh eq 4 38 39 however o2 plays a dominant role in the degradation of smt by bi ti pac 2 700 therefore when the ph gradually increases the reduction of h is accompanied by the reduction of o2 consumption thus improving the degradation efficiency of smt in addition h also plays a very important role in bi ti pac 2 700 composite degradation of smt although increased ph promotes the production of more oh eqs 4 and 5 h plays a more important role than oh in the degradation of smt by bi ti pac 2 700 therefore when the ph value was high the oxidation capacity of h decreased due to their electropositive nature 44 45 thus inhibiting the photocatalytic degradation of smt 2 o2 e o2 3 o2 2h e h2o2 4 h2o2 e oh oh 5 h oh oh 3 4 2 effect of humic acid because natural organic matter often co exists with sulfonamides in surface water the effect of humic acid ha the main component of natural organic matter as a coexisting pollutant on the photocatalytic degradation of smt was analyzed the effect of different ha concentrations on the photocatalytic degradation of smt by bi ti pac 2 700 is shown in fig 8 as the initial concentration of ha was increased from 0 to 5 mg l the efficiency of bi ti pac 2 700 composite s photocatalytic degradation of smt decreased by 28 and the reaction rate decreased by 62 1 several factors could lead to ha s ability to inhibit the efficiency of the photocatalytic degradation of smt by bi ti pac 2 700 the ha competed with smt for photocatalytic reactive oxygen species thus reducing the efficiency of photocatalytic degradation of smt 46 the photocatalytic degradation of ha produced a high content of complex intermediates 47 48 which also consume reactive oxygen species 3 4 3 effect of inorganic ions in addition to the natural organic matter mentioned in the previous section there are many types of inorganic ions co existing in natural water with sulfonamides and these inorganic ions will affect the efficiency of photocatalytic degradation of pollutants 26 inorganic ions usually affect the photocatalytic degradation process in the following two ways first inorganic ions and target pollutants also compete for adsorption on the surface of the catalyst or remove oh or other reactive oxygen species so as to reduce the degradation rate of pollutants second inorganic anions can be converted into active free radicals or form an electrostatic field near the catalyst to promote the separation of electrons and holes 25 32 therefore we selected three inorganic ions to investigate the effect of bi ti pac 2 700 composite on the photocatalytic degradation of smt as shown in fig 9 the effect of each inorganic ion was evaluated at several different initial concentrations as the concentration of bicarbonate hco3 increased the photocatalytic degradation rate of smt by bi ti pac 2 700 composite improved in general hco3 consumes oh and h to generate carbonate radicals co3 eqs 6 and 7 thus inhibiting photocatalytic degradation reactions 49 however o2 played a leading role in the photocatalytic degradation of smt by bi ti pac 2 700 in this study the addition of hco3 changed the ph of the solution from 7 to 8 5 increasing the content of o2 in the solution and as seen above thereby improving the photocatalytic degradation efficiency in contrast for cl and so4 2 a decrease in the photocatalytic degradation efficiency was observed fig 8 b c the addition of cl and so4 2 did not change the ph of the solution and they reacted with h to form reactive oxygen species less active than oh eqs 8 and 9 49 the effect of h on photocatalytic degradation of smt by bi ti pac 2 700 was only lower than that of o2 therefore with the increase of cl and so4 2 dosage h consumption gradually increased leading to the decrease of photocatalytic degradation efficiency 6 hco3 oh co3 h2o 7 hco3 h co3 8 cl h cl 9 so4 2 h so4 3 5 stability and reusability of prepared catalysts five photocatalytic experiment cycles were conducted in order to investigate the stability and reusability of bi ti pac 2 700 at the end of each photocatalytic experiment the composite was filtrated washed and dried at 70 c for 12 h to be prepared for the next use in order to ensure the same solid liquid ratio of each photocatalytic test the recovered catalyst was weighed and the smt solution was reduced according to the amount of catalyst dosage since the reduction of mass loss was minor from 0 05 g in the first cycle to 0 048 g 0 044 g 0 040 g and 0 036 g in second third fourth and fifth cycle respectively hence the degradation efficiency of smt after five reaction cycles marginally decreased with each cycle from 100 to 97 1 95 4 91 5 and finally 90 4 the reason for this phenomenon was most likely that the pac pores on bi ti pac 2 700 were blocked by pollutants resulting in a decrease of smt adsorption on the surface of the composite reduced adsorption led directly to a reduction in the photocatalytic generation of reactive oxygen species that would degrade smt leading to the decrease of degradation rate 25 another possible explanation was that that there were more intermediate products of photocatalytic degradation of smt enriched on the surface of the catalyst which competed with the newly added smt for oh h and o2 nonetheless the high efficiency after five cycles showed that bi ti pac 2 700 was a stable photocatalyst for reuse in multiple cycles fig 10 3 6 proposed degradation pathway in order to identify the intermediates produced during the degradation of smt by bi ti pac 2 700 and to infer the photocatalytic degradation pathway of smt lc ms was used to measure several samples during the 120 min photocatalytic reaction according to the ion diagram obtained by lc ms and the corresponding mass spectrogram we inferred eight intermediates whose serial number structural formula and charge mass ratio are shown in fig 11 from this we determined four possible photocatalytic degradation pathways of smt in pathway i the o2 and oh mediated oxidation of smt produced hydroxylated sulfamethazine a or b 50 51 during the process the bond marked a had a strong electronegativity which was easily attacked by o2 and oh because it was attached to the aromatic ring 25 43 subsequently a and b continued to be oxidized by reactive oxygen species to form c and d in pathway ii reactive oxygen species such as o2 and oh can directly eliminate the so2 of smt between bond b and d to form substance e 52 in pathway iii during the process of oxidation and nc bond bond c cleavage smt degraded to 4 amino n carbamimidoylbenzenesulfonamide f and the products continued to be degraded to form g 50 53 in pathway iv the cleavage of bond d sn in smt by oxidation produced 2 amino 4 6 dimethylpyrimidine h and sulfanilic acid undetected in this study 50 beyond that other possible intermediate products could include degradation into co2 h2o and inorganic ions 54 55 3 7 photocatalytic activity in natural water in order to investigate the effect of bi ti pac 2 700 composite on smt in natural water two kinds of natural water were taken river water rw tonghui river in the chaoyang district beijing and lake water lw lianshi lake in the fengtai district beijing their water quality indexes are shown in table s3 as can be seen from fig 12 the efficiency of photocatalytic degradation of smt by bi ti pac 2 700 in natural water is lower than that in deionized water which may be due to the complex types of pollutants in river and lake water these organic materials compete with smt to produce reactive oxygen species in the photocatalytic reaction another reason for the decreased efficiency was that the turbidity of the natural water was higher than that of deionized water increased turbidity led to an increase of light scattering and the inhibition of photon transmission rate thus affecting the generation of reactive oxygen species although the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of smt in river water was the lowest it reached 85 2 after 120 min of photocatalysis this result indicated that bi ti pac 2 700 was an efficient photocatalyst for degrading pollutants in water 4 conclusions in this study bi ti pac 2 700 with excellent photocatalytic efficiency under solar irradiation was successfully synthesized by using a two stage calcination method and its material characteristics photocatalytic degradation performance on smt and reaction mechanism were evaluated the main conclusions were as follows 1 compared with bi ti pac 1 bi ti pac 2 500 and bi ti pac 2 600 bi ti pac 2 700 had the highest photocatalytic degradation efficiency of smt under solar light irradiation the degradation efficiency of bi ti pac 2 700 for smt can reach 100 with a photocatalyst dosage of 0 2 g l and a 120 min photocatalytic reaction duration bi ti pac 2 700 had a rutile anatase mixed crystal phase an average crystal size of 48 nm and a band gap of 2 58 ev 2 the results showed that different water quality parameters had obvious effects on the smt degradation efficiency of bi ti pac 2 700 an increase of hco3 or ph improved the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of smt while the addition of ha cl or so4 2 had a negative effect on it when natural water was used in tests greater turbidity and concentration of organic matter led to a larger decrease of the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of bi ti pac 2 700 3 through epr measurements and trapping experiments the reactive oxygen species responsible for the photocatalytic degradation of smt by bi ti pac 2 700 were identified to be in order of significance o2 h oh 4 eight intermediates were identified during the photocatalytic degradation of smt by bi ti pac 2 700 which suggested that the degradation pathway of smt is mainly composed of four processes oxidation of o2 or oh so2 extrusion nc bond cleavage and sn bond cleavage 5 the efficiency of bi ti pac 2 700 composite photocatalytic degradation of smt in natural water was lower than that in deionized water but was still 85 indicating that bi ti pac 2 700 is an efficient photocatalyst that can be applied to practical processes declaration of competing interest

14053,in a previous study we used a sol hydrothermal method with a one stage calcination in an air atmosphere at 400 c to prepare composites of bi2o3 tio2 supported on powdered activated carbon bi ti pac 1 however the photocatalytic efficiency of those composites was relatively low due to their high band gap and the single crystal phase of their tio2 to improve the photocatalytic efficiency we developed a two stage calcination method with a first calcination in air at 300 c followed by a second calcination in a n2 atmosphere at 500 600 or 700 c to form the bi2o3 tio2 composites bi ti pac 2 compared with bi ti pac 1 the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of sulfamethazine smt by bi ti pac 2 700 increased by 32 under solar light irradiation bi ti pac 2 700 contained two tio2 crystal phases rutile and anatase and its band gap was 2 58 ev far less than that of bi ti pac 1 electron paramagnetic resonance measurements and trapping experiments showed that the superoxide radical hole and hydroxyl radical each played an important role in the degradation of smt among which the superoxide radical predominated the degradation pathway of smt included four processes oxidation of hydroxyl radical so2 extrusion nc and sn bond cleavage we also determined that solution ph humic acid and inorganic ions had varying effects on the photocatalytic degradation capability of bi ti pac 2 700 we measured the efficiency of bi ti pac 2 700 for smt degradation in natural river and lake water and found it to be 85 sufficient for practical applications this study provides a green and efficient photocatalyst that can be applied to water treatment processes keywords solar light irradiation sulfamethazine photocatalysis degradation pathway 1 introduction sulfamethazine smt is one of the most widely used synthetic antibiotics and has high hydrophilicity good stability and low cost 1 it can prevent animal diseases promote body growth interfere with the synthesis of folic acid and inhibit the growth and reproduction of bacteria 2 however when smt enters the environment it will cause drug resistance in pathogenic bacteria induce antibiotic resistance genes in food animals and cause extremely serious harm to aquatic organisms in the environment and adversely impact human health 3 therefore a technology that can effectively degrade it is urgently needed at present biodegradation membrane filtration physical adsorption and other technologies have been widely studied to remove smt from water 4 these approaches have the disadvantages of high energy consumption high operation and maintenance cost low treatment efficiency and secondary pollution 5 7 advanced oxidation processes aops such as fenton s reaction electrocatalysis photocatalysis and ozone oxidation have also been widely studied for degradation of smt 8 among them titanium dioxide tio2 photocatalysis is widely used to degrade sulfonamide antibiotics and other organic pollutants in water due to its low cost stable physicochemical properties non toxicity non selectivity easy operation and lack of secondary pollution 9 there are two major limitations in the practical application of tio2 its difficulty of separation from water and its low utilization efficiency of visible light 10 many researchers use semiconductor composite technology metal and non metal ion doped technology to reduce the band gap energy of semiconductor extended the electron and hole survival time and the spectral absorption region 11 14 the development of photocatalysts with supporting materials was also a focus of current research some researchers used g c3n4 and carbon nanotubes as carriers to develop new photocatalysts to improve photocatalytic activity 15 19 jessl et al 20 used honeycomb carbon nanotubes to load bivo4 enabling it to act as an electrode for solar photolysis of water enamul et al 21 studied the preparation of nanostructured graphene organic framework which can be used as a new generation of materials in electronic devices drug carriers and other fields basavarajappa et al 22 prepared gd3 substituted bismuth ferrite bf photocatalyst by sol gel method and studied the effect of gd3 substitution on the structure optical and surface properties of gd3 substituted bf nanoparticles therefore we decided to also develop a novel photocatalytic material with high activity to address the shortcomings of tio2 to solve the first problem activated carbon can be used to support tio2 because of its numerous advantages including its prevalent use in the treatment of drinking water and sewage its ability to absorb various organic pollutants in water and its variety of particle sizes and shapes 23 to address the second limitation many researchers have found that tio2 can be doped with bismuth oxide bi2o3 to improve its ability to respond to visible light 24 in a previous study we constructed a bi doped tio2 composite supported on powdered activated carbon which could photocatalytically degrade smt under visible light and had a good adsorption capacity 25 however due to its low photocatalytic efficiency it was necessary to increase the dosage of photocatalyst 1 0 g l and visible light irradiation time 300 min to achieve a degradation efficiency of smt of 80 so it was not conducive to immediate practical application the band gap energy and the crystal phase of tio2 can determine the photocatalytic efficiency of a composite 26 tio2 supported on activated carbon can reduce the band gap of the catalyst making it easier for photo induced electrons and holes to be separated thus improving its photocatalytic efficiency 27 28 additionally it has been reported that increasing calcination temperature can promote the transformation of tio2 from the anatase phase to the rutile phase and the photocatalytic effect can be improved when the two kinds of tio2 phases exist simultaneously 29 however in our previous studies in order to not only ensure the formation of tio2 and bi2o3 in the photocatalyst but also ensure that there was not a large loss of activated carbon the catalyst was calcined at 400 c in an air atmosphere if the calcination temperature exceeded 400 c an excessive amount of activated carbon would be lost here we improved the preparation by using a two stage calcination process yielding a series of bi doped tio2 composites supported by activated carbon with a low band gap and a mixed rutile anatase phase the first stage calcination occurred at 300 c in an air atmosphere which not only formed the tio2 and bi2o3 but also avoided the loss of activated carbon the second stage calcination was at a higher temperature 500 600 and 700 c under a n2 atmosphere to promote the transformation of the anatase phase and the growth of the rutile phase we compared the smt degradation capability of this series of photocatalysts to similar materials generated with a single stage calcination 400 c in air process we also analyzed effect of calcination temperature water quality parameters and repeat cycles on the ability of the two stage composites to degrade smt finally we analyzed the photocatalytic mechanism intermediate products and

industrial corporation shanghai china methyl alcohol hplc grade was obtained from fisher scientific usa 2 2 synthesis of composite based on the results from our previous study 25 the composites were fabricated to have a 1 10 bi ti molar ratio the general process consisted of combining a ti solution solution a with a bi solution solution b solution a was prepared by slowly pouring 10 ml ti obu 4

was then dripped into solution a then 0 5 g pac was added while mixing by magnetic stirring and the stirring was continued for 5 h the resulting sol was transferred into a teflon container inside a stainless steel autoclave reactor a hydrothermal treatment was conducted at 150 c for 12 h the obtained precipitates were dried at 125 c and calcined in two stages in the first stage the composite was calcined for 2 h at 300 c in an air atmosphere and in the second stage the composite was calcined at 500 600 or 700 c in a n2 atmosphere the final composite was named bi ti pac 2 x whereby x denotes

plexiglas container which was surrounded by a water cooling device before each photocatalytic reaction dark adsorption was performed for 30 min to ensure that the catalyst reached adsorption equilibrium the samples were collected at different time intervals and filtered through 0 22 μm syringe filters bhlm china to determine factors that influenced the photocatalytic degradation the solution ph was adjusted to 3 5 7 9 and 11 by the addition of 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh the humic acid concentrations used were 0 5 2 and 5 mg l and the inorganic ion concentrations were 0 5 2 and 5 mm the trapping experiment conditions were similar to those of the photocatalytic degradation tests disodium ethylene diamine tetra acetate benzoquinone and isopropanol were used as the trapping agents of h o2 and oh respectively before the experiments the trapping agent concentration was set to 0 5 2 or 5 mm the kinetics of photocatalytic degradation with the bi ti pac 2 x composites followed a

to investigate reaction oxidation species epr spectra were collected at ambient temperature 25 c in duplicate or triplicate on a jeol jes fa200 electron spin resonance spectrometer 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of bi ti pac composites the average crystal size of bi ti pac 2 700 estimated using scherrer s formula was 48 0 nm which was larger than the crystal size of bi ti pac 2 600 36 6 nm and that of bi ti pac 2 500 14 8 nm these results show that the calcination temperature had a large effect on the crystallinity of the nanoparticles and the increase of calcination temperature was conducive to crystal growth 30 31 however the bet surface area and pore volume of the prepared catalyst decreased slightly with the increase of calcination temperature the decreases were caused by two factors first the higher calcination temperature increased the crystal phase of tio2 and bi2o3 thus reducing the specific surface area of the bi ti pac 2 700 composite second tio2 and bi2o3 crystals were deposited into the pac pores of the composite 32 according to the iupac classification bi ti pac 2 700 displayed a type iv isotherm fig s1 a furthermore as displayed in table s1 the pore size of the various as synthesized bi ti pac 2 x were all 8 9 nm which fell in the scope of mesoporous pore size 2 50 nm the isotherms of bi ti pac 2 700 fig s1 b presented h1 type hysteresis loops another indication that the prepared composite had a mesoporous structure 33 34 additionally the band gap of the bi ti pac 2 700 was 2 58 ev calculated from a plot of αhν 1 2 versus the photo energy hν the band gap of bi ti pac 2 700 was smaller than that of the other two composites indicating that it was easier to transfer photogenerated electrons and holes 24 the xrd patterns of bi ti pac 2 500 bi ti pac 2 600 and bi ti pac 2 700 are shown in fig 1 the diffraction peaks in bi ti pac 2 500 can be assigned to the anatase phase of tio2 and to bi2o3 the diffraction peak at 27 2 corresponded to the 111 crystal plane of bi2o3 jcpds no 74 1633 and those at 25 3 37 8 38 6 48 0 53 8 and 62 1 corresponded to the 101 004 112 200 105 and 213 crystal planes of anatase tio2 respectively jcpds no 71 1166 furthermore when the second stage calcination temperature was 600 or 700 c the diffraction peaks not only showed the above two crystal phases but also revealed the rutile crystal phase of tio2 for bi ti pac 2 600 or bi ti pac 2 700 the diffraction peaks at 27 2 38 8 40 7 44 5 57 2 and 64 8 corresponded to the 110 200 111 210 220 and 310 planes of rutile tio2 jcpds no 76 0323 and 88 1173 in addition the diffraction peak height and sharpness of bi ti pac 2 700 were higher than those of the other two catalysts indicating that its crystallinity was the highest fig 2 shows the surface morphology and microscopic lattice of bi ti pac 2 700 from fig 2 a it can be seen that the photocatalyst was composed mostly of the pac in a terraced structure and the carbon holes on the surface were clearly visible the particles of tio2 of different sizes were spherical or irregularly agglomerated on the surface of the pac and there were fine bi2o3 particles accumulated or attached to the surface of tio2 in addition the corresponding eds spectra fig 2 b of bi ti pac 2 700 showed the existence of all elements c o ti and bi in the composite the surface morphology of bi ti pac 2 700 along with eds elemental mapping showed that bi ti and o were distributed rather evenly over the c surface fig 2 c further confirming the successful preparation of the bi ti pac 2 700 composite as seen in the tem image fig 2 d the c in the composite was amorphous while the tio2 crystal was homogeneous and dense from fig 2 e we concluded that the anatase and rutile phases of the tio2 nanoparticles were reasonably well anchored on the surface of the pac the d spacing of 0 352 nm from 3 52 10 0 352 nm in the lattice fringes corresponded to the 101 plane of anatase tio2 jcpds no 71 1166 in addition the d spacing of 0 171 nm from 1 71 10 0 171 nm in the lattice fringes corresponded to the 211 plane of rutile tio2 jcpds no 76 0323 furthermore the selected area electron diffraction saed images fig s3 also confirmed the presence of the anatase rutile mixture in the composite which was consistent with the results obtained with xrd the chemical composition and valence states of bi ti pac 2 700 was analyzed with xps there were two strong peaks in the high resolution xps spectrum at 158 6 and 163 9 ev fig 3 a belonging to bi4f7 2 and bi4f5 2 respectively the results were consistent with the xps spectra of pure bi2o3 35 indicating that the valence state of the bi cation in the composite was 3 36 in the high resolution spectrum of ti fig 3b the peaks at 464 6 and 458 9 ev corresponded ti2p1 2 and ti2p3 2 respectively the binding energy difference between the two peaks was 5 7 ev indicating that the valence state of ti was 4 24 37 in addition no peaks corresponding to ti3 and ti2 were found in the spectrum 23 the peak at 532 9 ev was attributed to the oxygen atoms in hydroxyl and ether groups in the pac 23 while the ti o ti linkages could be associated with the observed o 1s peak at 530 2 ev 27 fig 3 c d it can be seen from fig 3 d that the c1 s spectra can be fitted with four peaks the first peak detected at 283 7 ev was attributed to carboxylic acid group 27 the second peak with a binding energy of 284 6 ev was assigned to carbon atoms in cc and ch groups the third 286 0 ev and fourth 288 6 ev peaks corresponded to carbon atoms bonded to oxygen atoms co co or oco 26 in summary the coexistence of tio2 bi2o3 and c in the bi ti pac 2 700 was demonstrated by xps which was in agreement with the eds analysis 3 2 photocatalytic degradation performances in order to select the composite with the best photocatalytic performance the efficiency of photocatalytic degradation of smt by bi ti pac 2 x composites prepared at different second stage calcination temperatures were evaluated as shown in fig 4 a when the solar light irradiation time was 120 min the degradation efficiency of smt by the bi ti pac 2 x composites with calcination temperatures of 700 600 and 500 c was 100 88 and 91 respectively with the increase of calcination temperature the photocatalytic efficiency did not increase or decrease linearly but coincided with the trend of semiconductor bandgap width of the three composites in section 3 1 this phenomenon indicated that the second stage calcination temperature was a main factor in determining the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of the bi ti pac 2 x composites the effect of calcination temperature on photocatalytic degradation efficiency was due in large part to the significant influence of the calcination temperature on the band gap the process of photocatalytic degradation of smt by bi ti pac 2 500 bi ti pac 2 600 and bi ti pac 2 700 all obeyed first order kinetic models with kinetic constants of 0 02072 0 01751 and 0 02905 min 1 respectively the photocatalytic degradation rate of smt by bi ti pac 2 700 was higher than that of the other two catalysts therefore bi ti pac 2 700 was selected as the photocatalyst for further smt degradation experiments in this study the efficiency of the bi ti pac 1 and the bi ti pac 2 700 composites were evaluated under the same conditions fig s6 when the photocatalytic experiment was carried out for 120 min the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of bi ti pac 1 was only 68 far lower than that of bi ti pac 2 700 compared with the bi ti pac 2 700 composite the xrd peak intensity of bi ti pac 1 was obviously weak indicative of poor formation of each crystal phase from fig s7 moreover the tio2 in bi ti pac 1 was only in its anatase phase and its photocatalytic effect was lower than that of the photocatalyst containing tio2 with a mixed rutile anatase phase in addition as shown in fig s8 the band gap of bi ti pac 2 700 was less than that of bi ti pac 1 which made it easier for bi ti pac 2 700 to use photons to improve photocatalytic efficiency furthermore the photocatalytic degradation efficiency and adsorption capacity of bi ti pac 2 700 were significantly higher than that of p25 as shown in the fig s9 3 3 photocatalytic degradation mechanism in general the photocatalytic degradation process of semiconductor catalysts can be summarized into the following steps first under light irradiation with sufficient energy electrons in the valence band of the semiconductor absorb photons and then transition to the conduction band along with photo induced holes generated on the valence band subsequently photoinduced electrons located in the conduction band react with dissolved oxygen in water to produce o2 which generates oh through a series of subsequent reactions at the same time the photoinduced holes h in the valence band react with water to form oh these oh o2 h and other reactive species produced by the light irradiation can directly degrade organic pollutants that are sensitive to free radicals 38 39 in order to investigate the photocatalytic degradation mechanism of smt by bi ti pac 2 700 composite we used epr measurements and trapping experiments as shown in fig 5 the signal of dmpo o2 and dmpo oh were not detected in the absence of light as shown in fig 5 a b however after solar light irradiation for 20 s a strong special spectrum with a peak intensity ratio of 1 1 1 1 was observed which could be assigned to the dmpo o2 adduct 40 additionally a four line spectrum with an intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 was also obtained which was characteristic of the dmpo oh adduct 41 the results indicated that o2 and oh were produced in the photocatalytic degradation of smt by the bi ti pac 2 700 composite in order to explore the role of h o2 and oh in the photocatalytic degradation of smt a trapping test was used to determine the degree of action of the reactive species fig 5 c the degree of inhibition of the three trapping agents on the photocatalytic reaction could reflect the role of the corresponding reactive oxygen species in the photocatalytic degradation of smt 42 43 it was observed that all three trapping agents could inhibit the photocatalytic degradation of smt by bi ti pac 2 700 and the degree of inhibition increased with the dosage of the trapping agent the results showed that oh h and o2 all played an important role in bi ti pac 2 700 composite photocatalytic reaction and their relative importance was o2 h oh from this we can infer that pac bi2o3 and tio2 played a synergistic role in the degradation of smt in the prepared bi ti pac 2 700 nanocomposite at the beginning of the reaction a lot of smt by activated carbon adsorption to the surface of a composite material when the solar light was irradiated the e from the valence band of tio2 migrated to the conduction band the valence band formed the h because of the potential difference bi2o3 and tio2 the e in the tio2 conduction band migrated to bi2o3 similarly the h in the valence of bi2o3 migrated to tio2 thus the survival time of photogenic e and h was prolonged the h and e then undergo a series of reactions to generate oh and o2 fig 6 was reaction schematic as shown in the supplementary materials 3 4 optimization of influencing factors 3 4 1 effect of initial ph the initial ph of the solution was adjusted to 3 5 7 9 and 11 respectively to evaluate the effect of ph on the degradation of smt by bi ti pac 2 700 as shown in fig 7 with the increase of the initial ph value of the solution the photocatalytic degradation efficiency increased from 92 to 100 fig 7a however the results of fitting a first order kinetic model of photocatalytic degradation showed that the rate of increase of degradation reached a maximum at ph 9 when ph 9 in the initial solution the degradation rate gradually increased with the increase of ph while when ph 9 the degradation rate decreased fig 7b and table s2 there are several reasons for this result first in the photocatalytic reaction photo induced electrons e will first react with dissolved oxygen in water to produce the superoxide radical o2 eq 2 and then o2 will react with hydrogen ions h and electrons to produce h2o2 eq 3 finally h2o2 reacts with electrons to produce hydroxyl radical oh eq 4 38 39 however o2 plays a dominant role in the degradation of smt by bi ti pac 2 700 therefore when the ph gradually increases the reduction of h is accompanied by the reduction of o2 consumption thus improving the degradation efficiency of smt in addition h also plays a very important role in bi ti pac 2 700 composite degradation of smt although increased ph promotes the production of more oh eqs 4 and 5 h plays a more important role than oh in the degradation of smt by bi ti pac 2 700 therefore when the ph value was high the oxidation capacity of h decreased due to their electropositive nature 44 45 thus inhibiting the photocatalytic degradation of smt 2 o2 e o2 3 o2 2h e h2o2 4 h2o2 e oh oh 5 h oh oh 3 4 2 effect of humic acid because natural organic matter often co exists with sulfonamides in surface water the effect of humic acid ha the main component of natural organic matter as a coexisting pollutant on the photocatalytic degradation of smt was analyzed the effect of different ha concentrations on the photocatalytic degradation of smt by bi ti pac 2 700 is shown in fig 8 as the initial concentration of ha was increased from 0 to 5 mg l the efficiency of bi ti pac 2 700 composite s photocatalytic degradation of smt decreased by 28 and the reaction rate decreased by 62 1 several factors could lead to ha s ability to inhibit the efficiency of the photocatalytic degradation of smt by bi ti pac 2 700 the ha competed with smt for photocatalytic reactive oxygen species thus reducing the efficiency of photocatalytic degradation of smt 46 the photocatalytic degradation of ha produced a high content of complex intermediates 47 48 which also consume reactive oxygen species 3 4 3 effect of inorganic ions in addition to the natural organic matter mentioned in the previous section there are many types of inorganic ions co existing in natural water with sulfonamides and these inorganic ions will affect the efficiency of photocatalytic degradation of pollutants 26 inorganic ions usually affect the photocatalytic degradation process in the following two ways first inorganic ions and target pollutants also compete for adsorption on the surface of the catalyst or remove oh or other reactive oxygen species so as to reduce the degradation rate of pollutants second inorganic anions can be converted into active free radicals or form an electrostatic field near the catalyst to promote the separation of electrons and holes 25 32 therefore we selected three inorganic ions to investigate the effect of bi ti pac 2 700 composite on the photocatalytic degradation of smt as shown in fig 9 the effect of each inorganic ion was evaluated at several different initial concentrations as the concentration of bicarbonate hco3 increased the photocatalytic degradation rate of smt by bi ti pac 2 700 composite improved in general hco3 consumes oh and h to generate carbonate radicals co3 eqs 6 and 7 thus inhibiting photocatalytic degradation reactions 49 however o2 played a leading role in the photocatalytic degradation of smt by bi ti pac 2 700 in this study the addition of hco3 changed the ph of the solution from 7 to 8 5 increasing the content of o2 in the solution and as seen above thereby improving the photocatalytic degradation efficiency in contrast for cl and so4 2 a decrease in the photocatalytic degradation efficiency was observed fig 8 b c the addition of cl and so4 2 did not change the ph of the solution and they reacted with h to form reactive oxygen species less active than oh eqs 8 and 9 49 the effect of h on photocatalytic degradation of smt by bi ti pac 2 700 was only lower than that of o2 therefore with the increase of cl and so4 2 dosage h consumption gradually increased leading to the decrease of photocatalytic degradation efficiency 6 hco3 oh co3 h2o 7 hco3 h co3 8 cl h cl 9 so4 2 h so4 3 5 stability and reusability of prepared catalysts five photocatalytic experiment cycles were conducted in order to investigate the stability and reusability of bi ti pac 2 700 at the end of each photocatalytic experiment the composite was filtrated washed and dried at 70 c for 12 h to be prepared for the next use in order to ensure the same solid liquid ratio of each photocatalytic test the recovered catalyst was weighed and the smt solution was reduced according to the amount of catalyst dosage since the reduction of mass loss was minor from 0 05 g in the first cycle to 0 048 g 0 044 g 0 040 g and 0 036 g in second third fourth and fifth cycle respectively hence the degradation efficiency of smt after five reaction cycles marginally decreased with each cycle from 100 to 97 1 95 4 91 5 and finally 90 4 the reason for this phenomenon was most likely that the pac pores on bi ti pac 2 700 were blocked by pollutants resulting in a decrease of smt adsorption on the surface of the composite reduced adsorption led directly to a reduction in the photocatalytic generation of reactive oxygen species that would degrade smt leading to the decrease of degradation rate 25 another possible explanation was that that there were more intermediate products of photocatalytic degradation of smt enriched on the surface of the catalyst which competed with the newly added smt for oh h and o2 nonetheless the high efficiency after five cycles showed that bi ti pac 2 700 was a stable photocatalyst for reuse in multiple cycles fig 10 3 6 proposed degradation pathway in order to identify the intermediates produced during the degradation of smt by bi ti pac 2 700 and to infer the photocatalytic degradation pathway of smt lc ms was used to measure several samples during the 120 min photocatalytic reaction according to the ion diagram obtained by lc ms and the corresponding mass spectrogram we inferred eight intermediates whose serial number structural formula and charge mass ratio are shown in fig 11 from this we determined four possible photocatalytic degradation pathways of smt in pathway i the o2 and oh mediated oxidation of smt produced hydroxylated sulfamethazine a or b 50 51 during the process the bond marked a had a strong electronegativity which was easily attacked by o2 and oh because it was attached to the aromatic ring 25 43 subsequently a and b continued to be oxidized by reactive oxygen species to form c and d in pathway ii reactive oxygen species such as o2 and oh can directly eliminate the so2 of smt between bond b and d to form substance e 52 in pathway iii during the process of oxidation and nc bond bond c cleavage smt degraded to 4 amino n carbamimidoylbenzenesulfonamide f and the products continued to be degraded to form g 50 53 in pathway iv the cleavage of bond d sn in smt by oxidation produced 2 amino 4 6 dimethylpyrimidine h and sulfanilic acid undetected in this study 50 beyond that other possible intermediate products could include degradation into co2 h2o and inorganic ions 54 55 3 7 photocatalytic activity in natural water in order to investigate the effect of bi ti pac 2 700 composite on smt in natural water two kinds of natural water were taken river water rw tonghui river in the chaoyang district beijing and lake water lw lianshi lake in the fengtai district beijing their water quality indexes are shown in table s3 as can be seen from fig 12 the efficiency of photocatalytic degradation of smt by bi ti pac 2 700 in natural water is lower than that in deionized water which may be due to the complex types of pollutants in river and lake water these organic materials compete with smt to produce reactive oxygen species in the photocatalytic reaction another reason for the decreased efficiency was that the turbidity of the natural water was higher than that of deionized water increased turbidity led to an increase of light scattering and the inhibition of photon transmission rate thus affecting the generation of reactive oxygen species although the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of smt in river water was the lowest it reached 85 2 after 120 min of photocatalysis this result indicated that bi ti pac 2 700 was an efficient photocatalyst for degrading pollutants in water 4 conclusions in this study bi ti pac 2 700 with excellent photocatalytic efficiency under solar irradiation was successfully synthesized by using a two stage calcination method and its material characteristics photocatalytic degradation performance on smt and reaction mechanism were evaluated the main conclusions were as follows 1 compared with bi ti pac 1 bi ti pac 2 500 and bi ti pac 2 600 bi ti pac 2 700 had the highest photocatalytic degradation efficiency of smt under solar light irradiation the degradation efficiency of bi ti pac 2 700 for smt can reach 100 with a photocatalyst dosage of 0 2 g l and a 120 min photocatalytic reaction duration bi ti pac 2 700 had a rutile anatase mixed crystal phase an average crystal size of 48 nm and a band gap of 2 58 ev 2 the results showed that different water quality parameters had obvious effects on the smt degradation efficiency of bi ti pac 2 700 an increase of hco3 or ph improved the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of smt while the addition of ha cl or so4 2 had a negative effect on it when natural water was used in tests greater turbidity and concentration of organic matter led to a larger decrease of the photocatalytic degradation efficiency of bi ti pac 2 700 3 through epr measurements and trapping experiments the reactive oxygen species responsible for the photocatalytic degradation of smt by bi ti pac 2 700 were identified to be in order of significance o2 h oh 4 eight intermediates were identified during the photocatalytic degradation of smt by bi ti pac 2 700 which suggested that the degradation pathway of smt is mainly composed of four processes oxidation of o2 or oh so2 extrusion nc bond cleavage and sn bond cleavage 5 the efficiency of bi ti pac 2 700 composite photocatalytic degradation of smt in natural water was lower than that in deionized water but was still 85 indicating that bi ti pac 2 700 is an efficient photocatalyst that can be applied to practical processes declaration of competing interest

14054,one of the well known methods is the use of permeable reactive barrier prb to treat groundwater in order to simulate the prb design due to the complexity of the equations governing hydraulic flow and pollutant transfer and the integration of these two sets of equations there is need to use simulated flow and pollutant transfer models modflow as quantitative model for groundwater flow modeling and mt3dms qualitative model for groundwater contamination modeling as well as gms software as graphical interface were used in the optimization section due to the extent of decision space in the objective function and the need for high reliability of the selective optimization algorithm metaheuristic algorithm ga is used the model is implemented under the non barrier condition and then comparing it with the optimum prb condition indicates that cost of treatment and total costs are reduced despite consideration costs of manufacturing and active materials presented in prb and then effect of changes in landfill pollution concentration level was studied in different scenarios also the simulation model was used to investigate the effect of changes of prb s active material length width and height parameters on pollutant concentration and treatment cost of the total prb costs 37 is related to manufacturing costs and 63 to active materials used in prb a comparison of the total costs reveals 45 benefit in the using condition and the optimum barrier width is 3 m its length is 35 m and its height is 25 m located 21 m from the well keywords permeable reactive barrier simulation optimization groundwater treatment genetic algorithm 1 introduction in the last few decades with the advent of industry large volumes of effluent have increased pollution levels in some aquifers through leakage of landfills underground tankers pipelines and high permeable areas the removal of pollutants from the aquifer is very costly and sometimes takes decades with the rapid development of the petroleum industry in recent decades the issue of groundwater contamination particularly in their vicinity has become important this problem is evident in arid and semiarid regions where have limited access to adequate surface water in recent years groundwater resource managers have been looking for ways to remove aquifers contamination the use of prbs is an evolving technology that has been developed and implemented over the past few years these barriers can be a proper way to treat groundwater with some benefits such as disinfecting converting pollutants into non toxic species low maintenance costs use of groundwater flow and reducing pollutant emissions 1 in this technology the active substances are placed below the surface and the plume of groundwater contamination is passed through the active part treated and removed from the other side treatment barriers carry contamination through the permeable barrier structure based on the natural movement of water 2 due to the cost benefit ratio of prb as well as ease of management and operation compared to other methods which are often more difficult and expensive prb is a very attractive method the barriers are usually created by placing high permeability materials such as grout filler mortar or shields to form a subsurface barrier the purpose of such barriers is to minimize the possibility of plume contamination and to minimize the risk of sensitive receptors such as freshwater wells or evacuate to surface water as contaminated water passes through the prb s area pollutants are stopped or converted to more desirable chemicals with less toxicity easier biodegradability etc therefore a prb is a barrier for pollutants not for groundwater flow 29 it is believed that after these systems are installed maintenance costs will be very low for at least five to ten years except for the costs of monitoring performance and utility there should be no other running costs 1 a schematic view of a prb is given in fig 1 selection and use of prb materials is based on various conditions such as the type of target contaminants e g organic or inorganic their concentration mechanisms needed to remove them biodegradation adsorption etc and hydrological conditions of the aquifer environmental effects availability and cost of materials 3 misaelides et al 4 reported that the removal of pollutants from groundwater by natural zeolites could also be because of sedimentation simon et al 5 stated that primarily zero valent iron zvi acts as a reducer in the system pollutant removal rates often depend on the grain size specific iron contact area and general geochemical conditions of the aquifer typically grains with a size between 0 2 25 mm and a contact area of 0 5 1 5 m2 g are used according to the 2002 usepa report most researches on prbs have focused on the use of zero valent metals especially metallic iron or zvi granules as a reactive substrate for the treatment of chlorinated organic compounds the 2005 6 report shows that over 60 of prbs installed worldwide are iron based these materials are usually in the form of chips foams iron balls particles and powders or as iron fillers for concrete panturu et al 7 concluded a study that the underlying processes involved in prb depend on the reactant bed used the choice of reactant bed depends primarily on the type of contaminant being treated treatment by the reactant bed is possible through adsorption sedimentation and decomposition processes zeolites and activated carbon are examples of these sorbents sedimentation reactions cause the formation of groundwater pollutants and thus these insoluble products become trapped in the barrier di et al 8 used three beds of iron calculus stone and sulfate lowering bacteria in four groups in order to remediate and prevent the rapid migration of chromium and nitrate ions into groundwater the column containing all three materials performed better than the other columns hosseini et al 9 used a column of nano zvi modified with iron and copper particles in order to remove high concentrations of nitrate in water in this experiment three concentrations of 100 200 and 300 mg l nitrate were used li et al 10 used fermented mulch with sand as a biological barrier to remove nitrate from contaminated groundwater using prbs the concentration of nitrite as well as ammonia was also measured below the barrier and the observations indicated that nitrite was stable but the soluble ammonia increased the recommended permissible concentrations for nitrate and nitrite ions in drinking water according to the latest standards and internationally important standards are extracted from harbaugh 11 surface water rarely contains more than 0 1 mg l nitrite unless it is heavily contaminated with sewage groundwater nitrate contamination has generally been associated with nitrogen fertilizer due to the increased nitrate content and its excessive concentration in groundwater maamoun et al 12 showed synthesized nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi was integrated in phosphate removal experiments from aqueous solution in which it showed a promising potential as a reactive material in the in situ remediation methods they conducted a study conﬁrmed that such presented model can be used for the promotion of the preliminary design of prbs eljamal et al 13 showed that the current application of nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi is subject to the countermeasure of water contamination that escalates with increasing population furthermore highest nzvi dosage resulted in the highest iron ions concentrations in solution due to the increased number of nanoparticles hence providing surface active sites more iron ions were present in limited oxygen supply condition involving initial air saturation showed due to decreased crystallization and precipitation which were favoured in continuous supply in the ga the method falls into the category of optimization algorithms that are able to find general optimal solutions or solutions that are close to them the ga allows a population consisting of a large number of individuals formed under special selection rules i e minimizing the cost function to optimize the fitting function during the evolution process wang and zheng 1988 31 used the modflow and mt3dms models and ga to investigate the effect of different conditions on the design of the purge system under the assumption of unsteady current they concluded that using multiple management courses reduced the total pumping cost aral et al 14 proposed another type of ga called progressive ga they used it to solve the problem of identifying the source of contamination in groundwater which the standard ga processes with a groundwater simulation model in iteration both parameters of contamination release time and well location are considered as continuous decision variables 9 fallico et al 15 noted that the aquifer treatment time was considered as a constraint value they found that practically the treatment time was a critical factor for optimizing the aquifer treatment system instead of considering this parameter in the constant optimization problem it is better to use it as a decision variable in the problem yan and minsker 16 used a model called artificial neural network instead of numerical models to simulate groundwater flow and contamination transmission their results showed that the model has significant success in reducing the volume of computations performed on large scale systems 10 chang et al 17 used a gcddp hybrid method derived from the combination of dynamic differential programming methods and ga in this method ga was used to find the optimum location of the well and the dynamic differential bounding algorithm was used to calculate the optimal pumping rate humphrey et al 18 performed numerical simulations in parallel with a computer network to speed up the optimal solution they used 13 random searches for the ga which in all cases achieved an acceptable level of quality with the construction of seven wells which indicates that even with the beginning of different early communities ga could achieve similar results majumder and eldho 19 developed a groundwater management model to improve it with the help of gms software and the pso algorithm groundwater flow and pollutant transport were simulated by modflow and mt3dms 8 we tried to give problem solving methods and got a more accurate answer in these problems to meet the convergence criterion the maximum number of fixed generations is considered to achieve the optimal response the main goal of this research is to find the best location as well as the best dimensions in the design of the prb in such a way that the economic performance of the problem can be optimized in terms of the costs involved in the treatment and implementation of the prb various studies have been carried out on prb so far but due to the extent of the problem in different quantitative and qualitative models and the difficulty of combining these two issues and optimizing all of the above simultaneously this study has different aspects to other studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials used in prb in a general classification the materials used in the prb can be divided into three categories materials that remove the target pollutant through adsorption sedimentation and biological reaction depending on how the target pollutant is removed the type of material used in the prb varies in this study the adsorption method was considered for the removal of nitrate by the use of porous concrete composed of pumice aggregate family langmuir s theory is based on four simplifying assumptions the adsorption takes place on a certain number of sites only one layer can be adsorbed single layer adsorption the surface of the adsorbent is homogeneous and no interaction occurs between the molecules of the adsorbed material the linear equation of langmuir isotherm is given in eq 1 1 c e q m 1 q m b c e q e where ce equilibrium concentration of adsorbed matter in the solution after adsorption mg l qe the amount of equilibrium adsorbed matter per unit mass of adsorbent mg g qm and b are langmuir constants which obtained by plotting ce qe and ce the basic assumption of the langmuir method is that the adsorption occurs uniformly on the active surface accordingly when one molecule is adsorbed on one surface the next molecule has no effect on the other molecules previously adsorbed on the surface the freundlich isotherm theory was supplemented by the budker theory in 1859 according to various experiments it has been found that the adsorption information from the liquid phase is in better agreement with the freundlich isotherm the adsorption sites in this isotherm were not completely homogeneous and the total amount of adsorbed material was the same for all types of adsorption sites the freundlich isotherm is applied to a wide range of materials that have heterogeneous surfaces such as carbon silica clay iron and even organic materials such as polymers the linear equation of the freundlich adsorption isotherm is given in eq 2 2 q e k c e 1 n where qe and ce are discussed in eq 1 k and n are two constants obtained by plotting log qe and log ce mehrani et al 20 worked on a project about the reduction of nitrate contaminant water pollutants according to the mentioned isotherms by porous concrete in order to reach the reaction coefficients table 1 presents the results of this study the best isotherm and aggregate were langmuir isotherm and pumice

experimental equilibrium adsorption capacity mmol g and n is the number of experimental points 2 2 groundwater flow and reactive solute transport simulation in addition to linking between quantitative qualitative and algorithmic models another challenge is the model layering which in addition to incorporating different problem solving modes run time of the model increases because of the layers enhancement from this perspective it has an optimal point and balances the two mentioned issues for this purpose 3 layers were considered for the model the height of the first layer is 5 m and the second and third layers are 10 m it should be noted that the length and width of each cell are considered 1 and 5 m respectively in this model considering the unsteady flow state modeling with 365 days duration and time step was considered daily the effective hydraulic conductivity and porosity parameters are divided into two general categories in the prb section the values of these parameters are 91 5 m day and 0 197 the entire aquifer except the barrier has values of 40 m day and 0 3 for effective hydraulic conductivity and porosity a pumping well at a specified distance from the landfill located downstream of the prb is intended and the required amount is 1000 m3 day the initial head for unsteady flow is assumed constant fig 2 shows the result of running the modflow quantitative model after 365 days the mt3dms code has the capability of controlling linear or nonlinear adsorption of controlled equilibrium unbalanced adsorption and first order reaction which can be used to simulate contaminant transport the general formulation of the finite rate adsorption design which can be used to model the transition mass between the moving and non moving domains in the two domain transmission diffusion model due to the proximity of nitrate adsorption by the selected aggregate to the langmuir isotherm the coefficients of this isotherm referenced in table 2 were used to adsorb the nitrate the langmuir isotherm constants for nitrate adsorption are kl mmol g equal to 1 2202 and b l mmol equal to 0 0645 20 the distribution coefficient of self treatment in groundwater depends on factors such as the type of pollutant the gradation of the porous mixture and the materials of the environment d is the effective molecular diffusion coefficient of the porous medium which is 16 243 10 5 m2 day according to reliable sources 21 22 in this study the apparent specific gravity of the prb is 8 79 108 mg m3 and 15 108 mg m3 for other parts of the aquifer 20 it should be noted that the initial concentration is considered 1000 mg l in the landfill mt3dms is unique because it contains three important classes of transmission solutions standard finite difference method particle routing based on eulerian lagrangian methods and total variation diminishing tvd in a single code most numerical methods for solving the transfer diffusion reaction equation can be classified as eulerian lagrangian and eulerian lagrangian compounds the eulerian method solves the transfer equation with a fixed grid method like finite difference the tvd method belongs to the eulerian type and is commonly used with numerical methods to reduce false oscillations despite its higher computational capacity this method is usually more accurate than the finite difference method in solving axis transmission problems moreover the mass oriented property and the need for low memory tvd is more compatible compared to other methods in this study the tvd solution method was used to understand the concept of governing groundwater flow and mass transfer first identify the rules governing groundwater hydraulics energy conservation law motion equation mass conservation law continuity equation and darcy s law in general the equation governing 3d groundwater flow in the presence of wells and springs can be expressed as follows 5 x k x x h x y k y y h y z k z z h z s s h t where kxx kyy kzz the aquifer hydraulic conductivity along the x y and z axes respectively ss special storage in porous materials h hydraulic head in the aquifer and t time plus eq 5 is the partial differential equation governing the groundwater flow in the porous materials the general equation in the three dimensional flow state and constant groundwater density this equation shows the equation governing the flow of groundwater in a heterogeneous environment under unsteady conditions the transport and distribution of the material from one point to another in the groundwater is a regular way for conveying the groundwater system is the means of this transmission and distribution according to the mass conservation law the mass change rate in the element must be equal to the difference between the input and output elements and it can be expressed as below 6 x d x c x y d y c y z d z c z x v x c y v y c z v z c c t in eq 6 c solute concentration di diffusion coefficients and vi flow rate components chemical and biological interactions alter the amount quality and distribution of solutes in the aquatic system and a substance can be absorbed by the solid particles in the environment or consumed by bacteria present in the environment 2 3 the objective function in this research the objective function consists of three costs barrier construction materials used in barrier and pollutant treatment to take into account all aspects the cost of a situation where the prb is not used has also been calculated separately in terms of function it is obvious that the higher the cost involved in prb section the more dimensions and width are conceivable for the barrier so the cost of the treatment decreases because of pollution load reduction also the higher the cost in the treatment section the lower the need for cost in the prb section in the prb cost section due to the matching costs there is a need to convert the cost of construction and materials used in prb into the annual cost that is included in the objective function 7 m i n z c m a t e r i a l c c o n s t r u c t i o n c r f c t r e a t m e n t s t 8 c r f i 1 i n 1 i n 1 9 i f h 7 c c o n s t r u c t i o n u c c 1 h w l 10 i f 7 h 20 c

materials up to 500 m the coefficient is 18 95 and if the digging of the prb occurs vertically with the height more than 20 m the coefficient would be 3 345 and will be added for every 5 m umc

extracted from drinking water treatment report besides ion exchange was chosen as the best method for nitrate treatment drinking water treatment 2012 cowell pollutant concentration in the well area mcl maximum contaminant level qwell output discharge of the well d distance from the nitrate plume and the prb location the location of the contamination is considered constant and the location of the barrier varies according to the value of parameter d it should be noted that the initial value of this parameter is the mean distance between the fixed contamination site and the fixed well location the coefficients related to eqs 15 and 16 are given by fig 3 which is derived and the expected annual cost at different concentrations 25 in order to understand some of the variables in the objective function a schematic diagram of the model is prepared in fig 4 2 4 the structure of the simulation optimization model the issue of designing a contaminated aquifer remediation management system has always been of concern to researchers the necessity of solving of hydraulic and transmission equations in such models to find the optimal condition requires a heavy computational volume simulator models do not guarantee the optimal design policy when used alone although these models can show aquifer response to design parameters they are not able to search and determine the optimal condition in this study matlab is used in order to establish a link between the simulator and the optimization algorithm simulation optimization techniques have proven to be powerful tools to reduce the cost of remediation and efficient operation of these systems 26 27 fig 5 shows the diagram of the simulation optimization process which shows the process of achieving the minimum cost after a repeated run of the model and changing its variables by the optimization algorithm as mentioned in the previous section the ga allows a population consisting of a large number of individuals formed under special selection rules i e minimizing the cost function to optimize the fitting function during the evolution process ga is used to find the most optimal and most economical solution to the problem according to the conditions defined in the objective function in the matlab environment in such a way that each iteration is performed in order to reach the optimal solution by changing the parameters of the problem modflow and mt3dms models are running and after calculating the objective function a new population of parameters is formed to achieve a better solution and this process repeats and makes a loop 3 results and discussion in ga the probability of mutation and coupling for each generation are considered to be 0 3 and 0 4 respectively after problem solving as indicated by the simulation results the optimal solution resulted in maximum utilization of prb potentials in order to reduce the inlet concentration to the treatment plant it is considered as below the width of 3 m length of 35 m a height of 25 m and a distance of 21 meter from the well fig 6 also shows the total cost reduction process during the iterations of the optimization algorithm in optimal conditions the cost of construction is 58 524 usd and its active materials are 98 280 usd total cost converts to 52 432 usd with an assumption of 5 year useful life and 20 annual interest rate 62 67 of the costs were related to the cost of construction of the barrier and 37 33 of it was related to the active materials in the barrier the total cost incurred in the optimal use of prb total costs related to prb and costs of treatment after prb is 1 169 970 usd which represents a 45 gain with the use of the barrier compared to non use of it fig 7 shows the changes in treatment cost over 1 year 3 1 sensitivity analysis of optimization model to changes in landfill pollution concentration level in this section six different scenarios and their effects on optimizing model are considered in order to investigate the changes in the concentration level of landfill pollution on the outlet concentration in the well area in different conditions it should be noted that in each of the mentioned scenarios in addition to solving the optimization problem the simulation model is also run in the absence of a prb and compared with the optimal one in each of the scenarios mentioned above considering constant for other model parameters change in the level of landfill contamination in six different scenarios with contamination concentrations of 1000 mg l 800 mg l 600 mg l 400 mg l 200 mg l and 100 mg l are considered to investigate the results of the optimization model the cost of nitrate pollutant treatment at optimum conditions the cost of prb constructing and executing at optimum conditions as well as the comparison and study of the treatment cost per liter of water in the application and non application of a prb are discussed the constraints for prb dimensions are w 1 2 3 m h 5 15 25 m l 5 15 25 35 45 55 m table 2 shows the characteristics and cost of the prb under optimum conditions for each of the landfill pollution concentration levels the concentration of the target contaminant at six different levels in the well area under optimal conditions in the use of prb is shown in fig 8 treatment costs per cubic meter of nitrate in the absence of prb at six levels in the landfill were 5 82 4 57 3 32 2 08 0 83 and 0 12 usd respectively fig 9 shows the details of the treatment costs with use and without the use of prb 3 2 sensitivity analysis of simulation model to changes in prb dimensions in order to investigate the changes of prb parameters assuming the three dimensional schematic scheme of the problem as shown in fig 4 on the concentration of the pollutant in the well area the cost of nitrate pollutant treatment and the cost of constructing and executing prb have been surveyed with the assumption of considering constant for other parameters of prb and aquifer first by changes of prb width in three modes 1 2 and 3 m the mentioned cases are investigated and compared as can be seen in fig 10 under equal conditions the prb width parameter had a significant impact on the contaminant concentration in the well area consequently the treatment cost would be greatly affected by this change changes in prb length and height parameters if the other barrier parameters are constant indicate that width is very sensitive compared to other dimensions but the relationships between mentioned parameters reveal that the concentration of the target pollutant concentration decreases with the escalation of height and length of the prb table 3 reveals the cost details for the different width of the barrier 3 3 sensitivity analysis of simulation model to changes in materials used in prb selection and use of prb material for removal of the desired pollutant are under conditions such as type of target pollutant concentration and mechanism required for removal hydrological conditions of the aquifer environmental and health effects availability and cost obviously by changing the material the concentration of pollutants crossing the prb will be different fig 11 illustrates this difference by considering the concentration of contamination it should be noted that the constants of zvi have been extracted from the article 28 the coefficient of distribution kd for zvi is 210 l kg and the constants for the first order reaction of zvi are k1 equal to 0 00288 1 s and k2 which is 0 0033 1 s in order to compare the two mentioned materials used in the prb correctly all of the parameters were constant except those related to the change of the active material in describing zvi reactions in addition to surface adsorption reactions first order chemical reactions also occur for zvi which is one of the most important reasons for conflicts of contaminant removal in two materials used in prb it should be mentioned that the average concentration of contaminant decreased by 3 54 times when using pumice the concentration is 621 mg l subsequently when using zvi the concentration is 175 mg l 4 conclusion in this study by reviewing related studies and backgrounds modflow and mt3dms models were selected as simulation and ga as optimization algorithm furthermore using the matlab environment the optimization process of ga was coded as well as the possibility of linking the model with the algorithm was provided the target contaminant was nitrate and the pumice prb was used as the reactive bed within the prb solving the model determines the optimum dimensions of the prb and its optimal location we introduce the assumptions underlying the problem the objective function and how to calculate the cost function and then enter the model inputs to evaluate the prb performance by calculating the concentration under non use conditions and the next run and evaluation of the simulated model to the changes of parameters of prb were done then the model was optimized to calculate the optimum dimensions of the prb a comparison of the total costs of nitrate contamination treatment and the costs associated with prb cost of manufacturing and active materials in the using of prb and not using prb reveals 45 benefit in the using condition in addition the optimum barrier width is 3 m its length is 35 m and its height is 25 m located 21 m from the well 37 of the total cost is related to the cost of construction of the barrier and 63 of it to the cost of the active material used in the barrier changing the effective parameters in prb design shows the high impact of the design initially on the width which the concentration of the contaminant decreases sharply and then on its height and length which corresponds to the optimal conditions indicating that the algorithm has been approved for optimal response sensitivity analysis in landfill pollution concentration level was studied in different simulation optimization scenarios it showed that whatever concentration level reduced total cost decreases and the barrier was farther than the well sensitivity analysis of simulation of other prb parameters indicates that changes in the length and height of the barrier were not affected by changes in the width of the barrier in other words width variations have a great impact on the contaminant concentration and consequently the treatment costs and it is the most important parameter affecting prb design finally replacing the material used in the prb from pumice to zvi results in significant reduction in the concentration of contamination which is due to the first order chemical reaction occurring in zvi declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
14054,one of the well known methods is the use of permeable reactive barrier prb to treat groundwater in order to simulate the prb design due to the complexity of the equations governing hydraulic flow and pollutant transfer and the integration of these two sets of equations there is need to use simulated flow and pollutant transfer models modflow as quantitative model for groundwater flow modeling and mt3dms qualitative model for groundwater contamination modeling as well as gms software as graphical interface were used in the optimization section due to the extent of decision space in the objective function and the need for high reliability of the selective optimization algorithm metaheuristic algorithm ga is used the model is implemented under the non barrier condition and then comparing it with the optimum prb condition indicates that cost of treatment and total costs are reduced despite consideration costs of manufacturing and active materials presented in prb and then effect of changes in landfill pollution concentration level was studied in different scenarios also the simulation model was used to investigate the effect of changes of prb s active material length width and height parameters on pollutant concentration and treatment cost of the total prb costs 37 is related to manufacturing costs and 63 to active materials used in prb a comparison of the total costs reveals 45 benefit in the using condition and the optimum barrier width is 3 m its length is 35 m and its height is 25 m located 21 m from the well keywords permeable reactive barrier simulation optimization groundwater treatment genetic algorithm 1 introduction in the last few decades with the advent of industry large volumes of effluent have increased pollution levels in some aquifers through leakage of landfills underground tankers pipelines and high permeable areas the removal of pollutants from the aquifer is very costly and sometimes takes decades with the rapid development of the petroleum industry in recent decades the issue of groundwater contamination particularly in their vicinity has become important this problem is evident in arid and semiarid regions where have limited access to adequate surface water in recent years groundwater resource managers have been looking for ways to remove aquifers contamination the use of prbs is an evolving technology that has been developed and implemented over the past few years these barriers can be a proper way to treat groundwater with some benefits such as disinfecting converting pollutants into non toxic species low maintenance costs use of groundwater flow and reducing pollutant emissions 1 in this technology the active substances are placed below the surface and the plume of groundwater contamination is passed through the active part treated and removed from the other side treatment barriers carry contamination through the permeable barrier structure based on the natural movement of water 2 due to the cost benefit ratio of prb as well as ease of management and operation compared to other methods which are often more difficult and expensive prb is a very attractive method the barriers are usually created by placing high permeability materials such as grout filler mortar or shields to form a subsurface barrier the purpose of such barriers is to minimize the possibility of plume contamination and to minimize the risk of sensitive receptors such as freshwater wells or evacuate to surface water as contaminated water passes through the prb s area pollutants are stopped or converted to more desirable chemicals with less toxicity easier biodegradability etc therefore a prb is a barrier for pollutants not for groundwater flow 29 it is believed that after these systems are installed maintenance costs will be very low for at least five to ten years except for the costs of monitoring performance and utility there should be no other running costs 1 a schematic view of a prb is given in fig 1 selection and use of prb materials is based on various conditions such as the type of target contaminants e g organic or inorganic their concentration mechanisms needed to remove them biodegradation adsorption etc and hydrological conditions of the aquifer environmental effects availability and cost of materials 3 misaelides et al 4 reported that the removal of pollutants from groundwater by natural zeolites could also be because of sedimentation simon et al 5 stated that primarily zero valent iron zvi acts as a reducer in the system pollutant removal rates often depend on the grain size specific iron contact area and general geochemical conditions of the aquifer typically grains with a size between 0 2 25 mm and a contact area of 0 5 1 5 m2 g are used according to the 2002 usepa report most researches on prbs have focused on the use of zero valent metals especially metallic iron or zvi granules as a reactive substrate for the treatment of chlorinated organic compounds the 2005 6 report shows that over 60 of prbs installed worldwide are iron based these materials are usually in the form of chips foams iron balls particles and powders or as iron fillers for concrete panturu et al 7 concluded a study that the underlying processes involved in prb depend on the reactant bed used the choice of reactant bed depends primarily on the type of contaminant being treated treatment by the reactant bed is possible through adsorption sedimentation and decomposition processes zeolites and activated carbon are examples of these sorbents sedimentation reactions cause the formation of groundwater pollutants and thus these insoluble products become trapped in the barrier di et al 8 used three beds of iron calculus stone and sulfate lowering bacteria in four groups in order to remediate and prevent the rapid migration of chromium and nitrate ions into groundwater the column containing all three materials performed better than the other columns hosseini et al 9 used a column of nano zvi modified with iron and copper particles in order to remove high concentrations of nitrate in water in this experiment three concentrations of 100 200 and 300 mg l nitrate were used li et al 10 used fermented mulch with sand as a biological barrier to remove nitrate from contaminated groundwater using prbs the concentration of nitrite as well as ammonia was also measured below the barrier and the observations indicated that nitrite was stable but the soluble ammonia increased the recommended permissible concentrations for nitrate and nitrite ions in drinking water according to the latest standards and internationally important standards are extracted from harbaugh 11 surface water rarely contains more than 0 1 mg l nitrite unless it is heavily contaminated with sewage groundwater nitrate contamination has generally been associated with nitrogen fertilizer due to the increased nitrate content and its excessive concentration in groundwater maamoun et al 12

nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi is subject to the countermeasure of water contamination that escalates with increasing population furthermore highest nzvi dosage resulted in the highest iron ions concentrations in solution due to the increased number of nanoparticles hence providing surface active sites more iron ions were present in limited oxygen supply condition involving initial air

progressive ga they used it to solve the problem of identifying the source of contamination in groundwater which the standard ga processes with a groundwater simulation model in iteration both parameters of contamination release time and well location are considered as continuous decision variables 9 fallico et al 15 noted that the aquifer treatment time was considered as a constraint value they found that practically the treatment time was a critical factor for optimizing the aquifer treatment system instead of considering this parameter in the constant optimization problem it is better to use it as a decision variable in the problem yan and minsker 16 used a model called artificial neural network instead of numerical models to simulate groundwater flow and contamination transmission their results showed that the model has significant success in reducing the volume of computations performed on large scale systems 10 chang et al 17 used a gcddp hybrid method derived from the combination of dynamic differential programming methods and ga in this method ga was used to find the optimum location of the well and the dynamic differential bounding algorithm was used to calculate the optimal pumping rate humphrey et al 18 performed numerical simulations in parallel with a computer network to speed up the optimal solution they used 13 random searches for the ga which in all cases achieved an acceptable level of quality with the construction of seven wells which indicates that even with the beginning of different early communities ga could achieve similar results majumder and eldho 19 developed a groundwater management model to improve it with the help of gms software and the pso algorithm groundwater flow and pollutant transport were simulated by modflow and mt3dms 8 we tried to give problem solving methods and got a more accurate answer in these problems to meet the convergence criterion the maximum number of fixed generations is considered to achieve the optimal response the main goal of this research is to find the best location as well as the best dimensions in the design of the prb in such a way that the economic performance of the problem can be optimized in terms of the costs involved in the treatment and implementation of the prb various studies have been carried out on prb so far but due to the extent of the problem in different quantitative and qualitative models and the difficulty of combining these two issues and optimizing all of the above simultaneously this study has different aspects to other studies 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials used in prb in a general classification the materials used in the prb can be divided into three categories materials that remove the target pollutant through adsorption sedimentation and

molecule is adsorbed on one surface the next molecule has no effect on the other molecules previously adsorbed on the surface the freundlich isotherm theory was supplemented by the budker theory in 1859 according to various experiments it has been found that the adsorption information from the liquid phase is in better agreement with the freundlich isotherm the adsorption sites in this isotherm were not completely homogeneous and the total amount of adsorbed material was the same for all types of adsorption sites the freundlich isotherm is applied to a wide range of materials that have heterogeneous surfaces such as carbon silica clay iron and even organic materials such as polymers the linear equation of the freundlich adsorption isotherm is given in eq 2 2 q e k c e 1 n where qe

qualitative and algorithmic models another challenge is the model layering which in addition to incorporating different problem solving modes run time of the model increases because of the layers enhancement from this perspective it has an optimal point and balances the two mentioned issues for this purpose 3 layers were considered for the model the height of the first layer is 5 m and the second and third layers are 10 m it should be noted that the length and width of each cell are considered 1 and 5 m respectively in this model considering the unsteady flow state modeling with 365 days duration and time step was considered daily the effective hydraulic conductivity and porosity parameters are divided into two general categories in the prb section the values of these parameters are 91 5 m day and 0 197 the entire aquifer except the barrier has values of 40 m day and 0 3 for effective hydraulic conductivity and porosity a pumping well at a specified distance from the landfill located downstream of the prb is intended and the required amount is 1000 m3 day the initial head for unsteady flow is assumed constant fig 2 shows the result of running the modflow quantitative model after 365 days the mt3dms code has the capability of controlling linear or nonlinear adsorption of controlled equilibrium unbalanced adsorption and first order reaction which can be used to simulate contaminant transport the general formulation of the finite rate adsorption design which can be used to model the transition mass between the moving and non moving domains in the two domain transmission diffusion model due to the proximity of nitrate adsorption by the selected aggregate to the langmuir isotherm the coefficients of this isotherm referenced in table 2 were used to adsorb the nitrate the langmuir isotherm constants for nitrate adsorption are kl mmol g equal to 1 2202 and b l mmol equal to 0 0645 20 the distribution coefficient of self treatment in groundwater depends on factors such as the type of pollutant the gradation of the porous mixture and the materials of the environment d is the effective molecular diffusion coefficient of the porous medium which is 16 243 10 5 m2 day according to reliable sources 21 22 in this study the apparent specific gravity of the prb is 8 79 108 mg m3 and 15 108 mg m3 for other parts of the aquifer 20 it should be noted that the initial concentration is considered 1000 mg l in the landfill mt3dms is unique because it contains three important classes of transmission solutions standard finite difference method particle routing based on eulerian lagrangian methods and total variation diminishing tvd in a single code most numerical methods for solving the transfer diffusion reaction equation can be classified as eulerian lagrangian and eulerian lagrangian compounds the eulerian method solves the transfer equation with a fixed grid method like finite difference the tvd method belongs to the eulerian type and is commonly used with numerical methods to reduce false oscillations despite its higher computational capacity this method is usually more accurate than the finite difference method in solving axis transmission problems moreover the mass oriented property and the need for low memory tvd is more compatible compared to other methods in this study the tvd solution method was used to understand the concept of governing groundwater flow and mass transfer first identify the rules governing groundwater hydraulics energy conservation law motion equation mass conservation law continuity equation and darcy s law in general the equation governing 3d groundwater flow in the presence of wells and springs can be expressed as follows 5 x k x x h x y k y y h y z k z z h z s s h t where kxx kyy kzz the aquifer hydraulic conductivity along the x y and z axes respectively ss special storage in porous materials h hydraulic head in the aquifer and t time plus eq 5 is the partial differential equation governing the groundwater flow in the porous materials the general equation in the three dimensional flow state and constant groundwater density this equation shows the equation governing the flow of groundwater in a heterogeneous environment under unsteady conditions the transport and distribution of the material from one point to another in the groundwater is a regular way for conveying the groundwater system is the means of this transmission and distribution according to the mass conservation law the mass change rate in the element must be equal to the difference between the input and output elements and it can be expressed as below 6 x d x c x y d y c y z d z c z x v x c y v y c z v z c c t in eq 6 c solute concentration di diffusion coefficients and vi flow rate components chemical and biological interactions alter the amount quality and distribution of solutes in the aquatic system and a substance can be absorbed by the solid particles in the environment or consumed by bacteria present in the environment 2 3 the objective function in this research the objective function consists of three costs barrier construction materials used in barrier and pollutant treatment to take into account all aspects the cost of a situation where the prb is not used has also been calculated separately in terms of function it is obvious that the higher the cost involved in prb section the more dimensions and width are conceivable for the barrier so the cost of the treatment decreases because of pollution load reduction also the higher the cost in the treatment section the lower the need for cost in the prb section in the prb cost section due to the matching costs there is a need to convert the cost of construction and materials used in prb into the annual cost that is included in the objective function 7 m i n z c m a t e r i a l c c o n s t r u c t i o n c r f c t r e a t m e n t s t 8 c r f i 1 i n 1 i n 1 9 i f h 7 c c o n s t r u c t i o n u c c 1 h w l 10 i f 7 h 20 c

materials up to 500 m the coefficient is 18 95 and if the digging of the prb occurs vertically with the height more than 20 m the coefficient would be 3 345 and will be added for every 5 m umc materials coefficient which equals 37 44 24 ct t pollutant treatment cost which effective parameters in the cost of nitrate treatment and influence of nitrate concentration on treatment cost are extracted from drinking water treatment report besides ion exchange was chosen as the best method for nitrate treatment drinking water treatment 2012 cowell pollutant concentration in the well area mcl maximum contaminant level qwell output discharge of the well d distance from the nitrate plume and the prb location the location of the contamination is considered constant and the location of the barrier varies according to the value of parameter d it should be noted that the initial value of this parameter is the mean distance between the fixed contamination site and the fixed well location the coefficients related to eqs 15 and 16 are given by fig 3 which is derived and the expected annual cost at different concentrations 25 in order to understand some of the variables in the objective function a schematic diagram of the model is prepared in fig 4 2 4 the structure of the simulation optimization model the issue of designing a contaminated aquifer remediation management system has always been of concern to researchers the necessity of solving of hydraulic and transmission equations in such models to find the optimal condition requires a heavy computational volume simulator models do not guarantee the optimal design policy when used alone although these models can show aquifer response to design parameters they are not able to search and determine the optimal condition in this study matlab is used in order to establish a link between the simulator and the optimization algorithm simulation optimization techniques have proven to be powerful tools to reduce the cost of remediation and efficient operation of these systems 26 27 fig 5 shows the diagram of the simulation optimization process which shows the process of achieving the minimum cost after a repeated run of the model and changing its variables by the optimization algorithm as mentioned in the previous section the ga allows a population consisting of a large number of individuals formed under special selection rules i e minimizing the cost function to optimize the fitting function during the evolution process ga is used to find the most optimal and most economical solution to the problem according to the conditions defined in the objective function in the matlab environment in such a way that each iteration is performed in order to reach the optimal solution by changing the parameters of the problem modflow and mt3dms models are running and after calculating the objective function a new population of parameters is formed to achieve a better solution and this process repeats and makes a loop 3 results and discussion in ga the probability of mutation and coupling for each generation are considered to be 0 3 and 0 4 respectively after problem solving as indicated by the simulation results the optimal solution resulted in maximum utilization of prb potentials in order to reduce the inlet concentration to the treatment plant it is considered as below the width of 3 m length of 35 m a height of 25 m and a distance of 21 meter from the well fig 6 also shows the total cost reduction process during the iterations of the optimization algorithm in optimal conditions the cost of construction is 58 524 usd and its active materials are 98 280 usd total cost converts to 52 432 usd with an assumption of 5 year useful life and 20 annual interest rate 62 67 of the costs were related to the cost of construction of the barrier and 37 33 of it was related to the active materials in the barrier the total cost incurred in the optimal use of prb total costs related to prb and costs of treatment after prb is 1 169 970 usd which represents a 45 gain with the use of the barrier compared to non use of it fig 7 shows the changes in treatment cost over 1 year 3 1 sensitivity analysis of optimization model to changes in landfill pollution concentration level in this section six different scenarios and their effects on optimizing model are considered in order to investigate the changes in the concentration level of landfill pollution on the outlet concentration in the well area in different conditions it should be noted that in each of the mentioned scenarios in addition to solving the optimization problem the simulation model is also run in the absence of a prb and compared with the optimal one in each of the scenarios mentioned above considering constant for other model parameters change in the level of landfill contamination in six different scenarios with contamination concentrations of 1000 mg l 800 mg l 600 mg l 400 mg l 200 mg l and 100 mg l are considered to investigate the results of the optimization model the cost of nitrate pollutant treatment at optimum conditions the cost of prb constructing and executing at optimum conditions as well as the comparison and study of the treatment cost per liter of water in the application and non application of a prb are discussed the constraints for prb dimensions are w 1 2 3 m h 5 15 25 m l 5 15 25 35 45 55 m table 2 shows the characteristics and cost of the prb under optimum conditions for each of the landfill pollution concentration levels the concentration of the target contaminant at six different levels in the well area under optimal conditions in the use of prb is shown in fig 8 treatment costs per cubic meter of nitrate in the absence of prb at six levels in the landfill were 5 82 4 57 3 32 2 08 0 83 and 0 12 usd respectively fig 9 shows the details of the treatment costs with use and without the use of prb 3 2 sensitivity analysis of simulation model to changes in prb dimensions in order to investigate the changes of prb parameters assuming the three dimensional schematic scheme of the problem as shown in fig 4 on the concentration of the pollutant in the well area the cost of nitrate pollutant treatment and the cost of constructing and executing prb have been surveyed with the assumption of considering constant for other parameters of prb and aquifer first by changes of prb width in three modes 1 2 and 3 m the mentioned cases are investigated and compared as can be seen in fig 10 under equal conditions the prb width parameter had a significant impact on the contaminant concentration in the well area consequently the treatment cost would be greatly affected by this change changes in prb length and height parameters if the other barrier parameters are constant indicate that width is very sensitive compared to other dimensions but the relationships between mentioned parameters reveal that the concentration of the target pollutant concentration decreases with the escalation of height and length of the prb table 3 reveals the cost details for the different width of the barrier 3 3 sensitivity analysis of simulation model to changes in materials used in prb selection and use of prb material for removal of the desired pollutant are under conditions such as type of target pollutant concentration and mechanism required for removal hydrological conditions of the aquifer environmental and health effects availability and cost obviously by changing the material the concentration of pollutants crossing the prb will be different fig 11 illustrates this difference by considering the concentration of contamination it should be noted that the constants of zvi have been extracted from the article 28 the coefficient of distribution kd for zvi is 210 l kg and the constants for the first order reaction of zvi are k1 equal to 0 00288 1 s and k2 which is 0 0033 1 s in order to compare the two mentioned materials used in the prb correctly all of the parameters were constant except those related to the change of the active material in describing zvi reactions in addition to surface adsorption reactions first order chemical reactions also occur for zvi which is one of the most important reasons for conflicts of contaminant removal in two materials used in prb it should be mentioned that the average concentration of contaminant decreased by 3 54 times when using pumice the concentration is 621 mg l subsequently when using zvi the concentration is 175 mg l 4 conclusion in this study by reviewing related studies and backgrounds modflow and mt3dms models were selected as simulation and ga as optimization algorithm furthermore using the matlab environment the optimization process of ga was coded as well as the possibility of linking the model with the algorithm was provided the target contaminant was nitrate and the pumice prb was used as the reactive bed within the prb solving the model determines the optimum dimensions of the prb and its optimal location we introduce the assumptions underlying the problem the objective function and how to calculate the cost function and then enter the model inputs to evaluate the prb performance by calculating the concentration under non use conditions and the next run and evaluation of the simulated model to the changes of parameters of prb were done then the model was optimized to calculate the optimum dimensions of the prb a comparison of the total costs of nitrate contamination treatment and the costs associated with prb cost of manufacturing and active materials in the using of prb and not using prb reveals 45 benefit in the using condition in addition the optimum barrier width is 3 m its length is 35 m and its height is 25 m located 21 m from the well 37 of the total cost is related to the cost of construction of the barrier and 63 of it to the cost of the active material used in the barrier changing the effective parameters in prb design shows the high impact of the design initially on the width which the concentration of the contaminant decreases sharply and then on its height and length which corresponds to the optimal conditions indicating that the algorithm has been approved for optimal response sensitivity analysis in landfill pollution concentration level was studied in different simulation optimization scenarios it showed that whatever concentration level reduced total cost decreases and the barrier was farther than the well sensitivity analysis of simulation of other prb parameters indicates that changes in the length and height of the barrier were not affected by changes in the width of the barrier in other words width variations have a great impact on the contaminant concentration and consequently the treatment costs and it is the most important parameter affecting prb design finally replacing the material used in the prb from pumice to zvi results in significant reduction in the concentration of contamination which is due to the first order chemical reaction occurring in zvi declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
