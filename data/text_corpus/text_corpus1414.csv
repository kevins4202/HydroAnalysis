7070,evaporation is an essential component in hydrological processes and accurate estimation of evaporation is of importance for sustainable management of water resources this study conducted a national scale assessment of different models for pan evaporation epan estimation at 178 meteorological stations across different climatic zones of china including the temperate continental zone tcz temperate monsoon zone tmz mountain plateau zone mpz and subtropical monsoon zone smz firstly three data driven models including extreme learning machine elm artificial neural networks optimized by particle swarm optimization pso ann and genetic algorithm ga ann were trained with nine input combinations of climatic variables the performance of the 27 proposed models along with the empirical stephens and stewart ss and physically based penpan models were investigated and compared using relative root mean square error rrmse nash sutcliffe coefficient ns and mean absolute error mae the three statistical indicators were further normalized to global performance indicator gpi by which all the evaluated models can be easily ranked the results showed that the data driven models with complete inputs generally obtained more accurate epan estimation where the elm model with full input data provided the best accuracy with average rrmse of 12 5 15 2 ns of 0 909 0 936 and mae of 11 7 19 9 mm m air temperature was found to be the most influential parameter to data driven models followed by sunshine duration wind speed and relative humidity the ss model provided slightly better results in mpz and tcz and slightly less accurate results in smz and tmz compared with the data driven models under the same input conditions overall elm was recommended as the best model for epan estimation when all the selected climatic data are available while temperature based pso ann is recommended in mpz and smz and temperature based ga ann is recommended in tcz and tmz when the other climatic data are missing keywords pan evaporation data driven models model performance assessment stephens and stewart model penpan model china 1 introduction pan evaporation epan is a crucial indicator of atmospheric evaporative demand yang and yang 2012 liu and sun 2016 which can reflect the status of global hydrological cycle under climate change held and soden 2006 roderick et al 2014 accurate estimation of epan is of importance for sustainable management of water resources the direct measurement of epan is both spatially and temporally restricted due to deficient instruments and practical issues kisi 2006 shiri et al 2014 therefore many methods have been proposed to indirectly estimate epan from meteorological variables such as the empirical stephens and stewart ss model physically based penpan model and data driven models kim and kim 2008 the penpan model was developed originally from the penman s combination equation and has been widely adopted for determining epan in china yang and yang 2012 modified the penpan model from the class a pan to estimate chinese d20 pan evaporation and quantify the contributions of climatic factors at 54 meteorological stations across china liu and sun 2016 used the penpan model to evaluate the performance of global climate models in terms of their capability to project annual seasonal and monthly statistics of epan in china li et al 2013 analyzed epan dynamics in the hyper arid region of china based on the results of penpan model xie et al 2015 modified the penpan model to estimate chinese d20 pan evaporation and assess the attribution of epan dynamics on the tibetan plateau during the last decades data driven approaches have been successfully applied in a sizable number of fields including hydrology many studies have evaluated the performance of data driven models for epan estimation in different regions around the world and the most widely used data driven model was artificial neural networks ann sudheer et al 2002 applied a multi layer perceptrons with backpropagation training algorithm to estimate epan and found that it provided favorable results chang et al 2010 developed a self organizing map neural networks to estimate daily epan kim et al 2012 used multilayer perceptron neural networks mlp nn generalized regression neural networks grnn and support vector machine neural networks svm nn to estimate daily epan in different climatic zones of republic of korea and iran and found svm nn performed better than mlp nn and grnn kisi 2013 proposed evolutionary neural networks enn for modeling monthly epan in mediterranean region of turkey and compared its performance with fuzzy genetic fg neuro fuzzy anfis ann and ss models the results indicated that the enn model had better prediction capacity than the fg anfis ann and ss models more recently some new data driven models have been developed for modeling epan guven and kisi 2013 compared the linear genetic programming lgp fg anfis ann and ss methods for estimating epan and found the lgp models outperformed the other models wang et al 2017 investigated the performance of six data driven models including mlp grnn fg least square support vector machine lssvm multivariate adaptive regression spline mars adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems with grid partition anfis gp and two regression multiple linear regression mlr and ss models in predicting monthly epan at eight meteorological stations of china the results showed that the models exhibited different results in different climates and the mlp model was generally better than the other models at most studied stations although the data driven models have been extensively adopted for epan estimation their performances across different climatic zones of china have been seldom reported wang et al 2017 especially at national scale in the present study three data driven models with different input combinations of climatic variables were developed and their performances were further compared against the empirical stephens and stewart model and physically based penpan model at 178 meteorological stations across different climatic zones of china the main objective was to investigate the applicability of the proposed data driven models in epan prediction with different climatic inputs at a national scale and recommend the optimal performing models in different climatic zones of china 2 study area and data collection 2 1 study area the mainland china generally has five climatic zones song et al 2011 fig 1 including the mountain plateau zone mpz the temperate continental zone tcz the temperate monsoon zone tmz the subtropical monsoon zone smz and the tropical monsoon zone in consideration of the significantly smaller land area and number of meteorological stations compared with the other climatic zones the tropical monsoon zone was incorporated into the smz for data analysis fan et al 2016 due to the data availability hong kong macao and taiwan were not considered in the present study the mpz covers the qinghai tibetan plateau and is characterized as a semi humid region with annual mean air temperature rainfall and epan of 3 2 c 414 mm and 1751 mm respectively fig 2 the tcz covers the northwest and north china which is characterized as an arid region with annual mean air temperature and rainfall of 7 2 c and 252 mm respectively it should be noted that annual mean epan in tcz is about 2030 mm which is approximately eight times amount of annual rainfall the tmz covers the northeast china and north china plain characterized as a semi arid region with annual mean air temperature rainfall and epan of 10 9 c 660 mm and 1587 mm respectively the smz covers most part of southern china characterized as a humid region with annual mean air temperature rainfall and epan of 17 7 c 1330 mm and 1448 mm respectively the spatial distribution of seasonal and annual epan in different climatic zones of china is presented in fig 3 with regard to the seasonal changes epan values in spring and summer were significantly higher than those in autumn and winter as for spatial differences tcz had the biggest epan values followed by mpz and tmz while smz showed the smallest epan values 2 2 data collection the d20 pan 0 20 m in diameter was widely used to measure epan in china from 1950s and has been replaced by another type of pan e601 pan 0 62 m in diameter from 2001 liu and sun 2016 among 824 meteorological stations in china some stations don t have epan measurements and some stations don t have long time series epan data considering the data availability and computation cost monthly epan and climatic data including maximum tmax minimum tmin air temperature at 2 m height mean relative humidity rh wind speed at 10 m height u10 and sunshine duration at 178 meteorological stations from 1961 to 2001 were used in the present study although global solar radiation is widely used and more accurate for evaporation estimation kisi 2013 fan et al 2018a there are only 123 stations with global solar radiation measurements in china fan and thomas 2018 fan et al 2018b in this way the coefficients of the angstrom prescott model for most weather stations have to be obtained from the other stations by using the interpolation methods thus the induced errors from calculated solar radiation data by the angstrom prescott equation may lead to large uncertainty in data driven models liu et al 2012 therefore the measured sunshine duration rather than the calculated or measured global solar radiation was used to train the data driven models in the present study geographical distribution of the selected meteorological stations is presented in fig 1 the data were provided and rigorously quality controlled by the china meteorological administration http data cma cn wind speed at 2 m height u2 was calculated from u10 data and mean air temperature ta was estimated by averaging tmax and tmin allen et al 1998 the d20 pan was made of copper 0 2 m in diameter and 0 1 m in depth and was placed 0 7 m above the ground to avoid birds drinking water from the pan a rim was built on the top of the pan yang and yang 2012 compared with the class a pan the d20 pan was smaller in size and contained less amount of water which resulted in a higher ratio of heat being transferred between the pan and the surrounding environment mcvicar et al 2007 yang and yang 2012 more details of the d20 pan are referred in yang and yang 2012 3 methods 3 1 extreme learning machine huang et al 2006 firstly developed extreme learning machine elm which was considered as a simple learning algorithm for single hidden layer feed forward neural networks slfn huang et al 2006 feng et al 2016 elm does not require too much human intervention and performs better than the traditional algorithms with faster running speed generally elm models consist of three layers input layer hidden layer and output layer which are connected by neurons fig 4 in the present study the input layer has m neurons corresponding to m input variables the hidden layer has l neurons and the output layer has only one neuron corresponding to the output variable epan the advantages of elm are 1 the hidden layer does not need to be tuned and 2 the learning speed is much faster than traditional feedforward neural networks abdullah et al 2015 more details regarding elm can be found in abdullah et al 2015 yaseen et al 2016 and feng et al 2017a 3 2 artificial neural networks artificial neural networks ann is an information processing system rajaee and shahabi 2016 ravansalar et al 2017 which is one of the most widely utilized data driven models it begins with data collection learning and adaption then pattern recognition and finally targeting the desired function by assessing various weights abdullah et al 2015 similar to the elm structure fig 4 an ann model also consists of three layers i e the input hidden and output layers there are various types of ann structural architecture among which the three layers back propagation bp algorithm with only one hidden layer is most commonly used in recent years juma et al 2014 ravansalar et al 2017 and it was thus selected as the bp neural networks in the present study bp algorithm is a typical gradient descent algorithm of which the major problems are easily getting stuck in a local minimum and overtraining kim and kim 2008 feng et al 2016 thus particle swarm optimization pso and genetic algorithm ga were introduced to optimize ann and then developed pso ann and ga ann respectively 3 2 1 particle swarm optimization pso is a stochastic optimization technique which was developed from collaborative behavior of biological populations in pso each particle with a fitness value is referred to an individual in a swarm nedic et al 2014 for each pso iteration k the position xi and velocity vi of particle i are updated by 1 x i k 1 x i k v i k 1 v i k 1 ω v i k c 1 r 1 i k p i k x i k c 2 r 2 i k g k x i k where ω is the inertia weight r 1 i k and r 2 i k are random values between 0 1 c 1 and c 2 are acceleration coefficients p i k is best position achieved by the particle itself so far g k is the best position achieved so far by whole swarm fig 5 shows the flowchart of the pso ann model more details of pso can be found in nedic et al 2014 3 2 2 genetic algorithm darwin s theory of evolution is the basic principle of ga which operates with a set of chromosome called population nedic et al 2014 the typical process of ga contains five procedures including initialization of population evaluation fitness selection crossover and mutation in this study absolute error was utilized as the fitness value to assess the capacity of ga 2 f k i 1 n abs y i o i where yi is the predicted output value of individual i oi is the desired output value of individual i k is the coefficient there are various methods for the selection of ga and the roulette was used in the current study thus the selection probability is calculated as 3 f i k f i 4 p i f i j 1 n f j where fi is the fitness value of individual i p i is the selection probability individual i n is the population size the crossover procedure for kth chromosome ak and lth chromosome al is defined as 5 a kj a kj 1 b a lj b a lj a lj 1 b a kj b where is a random value between 0 1 the jth chromosome of individual i was selected for mutation 6 a ij a ij a ij a max r 2 1 g g max 2 r 0 5 a ij a min a ij r 2 1 g g max 2 r 0 5 where a max and a min are the maximum and minimum of chromosome aij r 2 is a random value g is the current iterations number g max is the iterations number r is a random value between 0 1 the flowchart of ga ann model is presented in fig 6 3 3 penpan model the penpan model was developed from the modified penman model which was used for the calculation of open water evaporation penman 1948 in the penpan model epan is estimated as the sum of the radiative and aerodynamic terms rotstayn et al 2006 yang and yang 2012 7 e pan δ r n δ a γ λ a γ δ a γ f q u v p d where δ is the slope of the saturated vapor pressure kpa k 1 λ is the latent heat of vaporization of water mj kg 1 γ is psychometric constant kpa k 1 rn is the net radiation mj m2 d 1 fq u is the vapor transfer function kg m 2 d 1 kpa vpd is the vapor pressure deficit at 2 m kpa a is a constant with value of 5 for chinese d20 pan yang and yang 2012 detailed calculation procedures of penpan model can be found in yang and yang 2012 the calculation of epan by the penpan model requires many meteorological variables including air temperature relative humidity wind speed global and diffuse solar radiation in the present study global solar radiation was estimated from sunshine duration data through angstrom prescott model allen et al 1998 feng et al 2017b fan et al 2018b and the constants of as and bs in angstrom prescott model were calibrated according to liu et al 2010 with average as and bs of 0 23 and 0 58 for the mpz 0 20 and 0 56 for the tcz 0 16 and 0 56 for the smz and 0 17 and 0 55 for the tmz respectively fan et al 2016 diffuse solar radiation was estimated from sunshine duration air temperature and relative humidity data through the model proposed by li et al 2012 3 4 stephens and stewart model stephens and stewart ss model is an empirical function of epan with global solar radiation and air temperature 8 e pan a b t a r s where a and b are constants rs is the global solar radiation mj m 2 d 1 ta is the mean air temperature c 3 5 model training calibrating and testing program codes were written in matlab to develop the three data driven models nine input combinations of meteorological variables were utilized to train the elm ga ann and pso ann models details of the input combinations are presented in table 1 three data driven models with nine input combinations were trained thus a total of 27 data driven models were developed data from 1961 to 1990 were used to train the models while data from 1991 to 2001 were utilized to assess the models thus there were 360 patterns 30 years 12 months of training data and 132 patterns 11 years 12 months of testing data as for the empirical ss model which was originated from the jensen and haise 1963 method epan estimates from the model might become negative for continental or alpine winter conditions thus the constants of a and b of the model were calibrated from the training data by least square method at each station although a k fold assessment of the models should be applied to evaluate the models shiri et al 2014 2015 feng et al 2017c the present study only conducted a hold out validation of the models due to impracticality of k fold assessment resulted by the large dataset used monthly data of 178 stations during 1961 2001 3 6 performance evaluation relative root mean square error rrmse nash sutcliffe coefficient ns and mean absolute error mae were applied to assess the models shiri et al 2015 feng et al 2017c 9 rrmse 1 m i 1 m y i x i 2 x 100 10 mae 1 m i 1 m x i y i 11 ns 1 i 1 m y i x i 2 i 1 m x i x 2 where xi and yi denote the measured and estimated values respectively x is the mean value of xi rrmse ranges from 0 perfect fit to the worst fit mae ranges from 0 perfect fit to the worst fit and ns ranges from 1 perfect fit to the worst fit it is challenging to compare or rank a large number of models with different statistical indicators therefore we utilized a global performance indicator gpi which demonstrates multiplication of all statistical indicators applied to prevent this problem firstly values of all indicators were scaled to prevent significant influence of any particular statistical indicator 12 x scaled x 0 x min x max x min where x scaled x 0 x min and x max are scaled value real value minimum value and maximum value of the specific indicator respectively thus the minimum and maximum scaled values of each indicator are 0 and 1 respectively despotovic et al 2015 then the gpi for model i is calculated as 13 gp i i j 1 3 α j g j y ij where α j is a constant with value of 1 for rrmse and mae j 1 2 1 for ns j 3 g j represents the median of scaled values of statistical indicator j y ij represents the scaled value of the statistical indicator j for model i greater gpi values indicate the better precision of the model this method normalizes three different statistical indicators as only one individual indicator thus it is much easier to compare the model performance in the present study the highest value of gpi at a station represents the best performance of the corresponding model and this model is thus ranked as the no 1 model at that station on the contrary the lowest value of gpi at a station indicates the worst performance of the corresponding model which is ranked as the no 29 model at that station 4 results spatial distributions of the performance of data driven models with all climatic variables as inputs elm1 pso ann1 and ga ann1 models are presented in fig 7 as shown in the fig 7 the three models all performed well for estimating epan at most stations with rrmse less than 17 8 ns over 0 85 and mae less than 22 5 mm m generally there were certain spatial differences in the model accuracy where the models showed relatively better accuracy in tcz and smz but relatively worse performance in tmz especially in north china plain the performances of elm2 pso ann2 and ga ann2 models are presented in fig 8 the three models were trained with sunshine duration air temperature and relative humidity data it can be seen from fig 8 that the three models all performed well for the estimation of epan at the majority of stations with rrmse less than 19 4 ns over 0 82 and mae less than 30 1 mm m generally the models showed relatively better accuracy in smz relatively worse performance in mpz compared with models with complete inputs elm1 pso ann1 and ga ann1 models with n t and rh as inputs showed slightly poorer performance indicating that removing u2 from model inputs didn t significantly reduce the prediction accuracy of the models spatial distributions of the accuracy of elm3 pso ann3 and ga ann3 models are presented in fig 9 the three models were trained with sunshine duration air temperature and wind speed as inputs the figure illustrated that all the three models had good accuracy for modeling epan at the majority of stations with rrmse less than 22 4 ns over 0 82 and mae less than 28 4 mm m the models had relatively better performance in smz relatively worse performance in mpz and tcz compared with elm1 pso ann1 and ga ann1 models models with n t and u2 as inputs also showed slightly poorer performance which indicated that removing rh didn t significantly reduce the accuracy of the models fig 10 illustrates the spatial distributions of the performance of elm5 pso ann5 and ga ann5 models which were trained with sunshine duration and air temperature as inputs the figure demonstrated that all the three models had good performance for modeling epan at the majority of stations with rrmse less than 25 6 ns over 0 75 and mae less than 31 2 mm m the models had relatively better performance in smz and tcz relatively worse performance in some stations of mpz compared with elm1 pso ann1 and ga ann1 models models with n and t as inputs also showed slightly poorer performance which indicated that removing rh and u2 didn t significantly reduced the accuracy of the models thus n and t were key input variables for models spatial distributions of the accuracy of elm5 pso ann5 and ga ann5 models are presented in fig 11 the three models were trained with relative humidity and wind speed as model inputs the figure showed that all the three models exhibited poor performance for epan estimation at the majority of stations with rrmse over 40 0 ns less than 0 45 and mae over 52 3 mm m the models had relatively better performance in some stations of smz located in southwest china with rrmse less than 25 0 ns over 0 65 and mae less than 34 0 mm m compared with elm1 pso ann1 and ga ann1 models models with rh and u2 as inputs had much poorer performance which indicated n and t were crucial for the modeling of epan spatial distributions of the accuracy of elm6 pso ann6 and ga ann6 models are presented in fig 12 the three models were trained only with relative humidity as input the figure illustrated that all the three models had much poor performance for estimating epan at the majority of stations with rrmse over 31 3 ns less than 0 24 and mae over 61 8 mm m however the models performed relatively better in several stations of smz located in southwest china with rrmse less than 31 3 ns over 0 62 and mae less than 34 1 mm m fig 13 shows spatial distributions of the performance of elm7 pso ann7 and ga ann7 models the three models were trained only with sunshine duration as input it can be seen from the figure that all the three models had relatively poor performance for modeling epan at the majority of stations with rrmse over 31 7 ns less than 0 50 and mae over 23 8 mm m however the models had relatively better performance in many stations of smz located in southern china with rrmse less than 24 7 ns over 0 75 and mae less than 23 8 mm m spatial distributions of the performance of elm8 pso ann8 and ga ann8 models are given in fig 14 the three models were trained only with air temperature as input including maximum and minimum air temperatures as shown in the figure all the three models had relatively good performance for modeling epan at many stations in china with rrmse less than 19 7 ns over 0 87 and mae below 21 3 mm m generally the models had relatively better performance in smz and relatively poor accuracy in tcz and tmz the three models had better performance than the models with only rh elm6 pso ann6 and ga ann6 or n elm7 pso ann7 and ga ann7 as model input confirming that the model accuracy was more affected by t compared with rh and n fig 15 presents the accuracy of elm9 pso ann9 and ga ann9 models the models were trained only with wind speed as input as shown in the figure all the models had less accurate results for epan modeling at most of stations with rrmse over 30 8 ns less than 0 47 and mae over 33 5 mm m however the models performed relatively better in some stations of mpz and smz located in qinghai tibetan plateau and southwest china respectively the models with only u2 as input had slightly better accuracy than those with only rh elm6 pso ann6 and ga ann6 but had less accuracy than those with only n elm7 pso ann7 and ga ann7 or t elm8 pso ann8 and ga ann8 as input indicating that u2 had more influence on model accuracy than rh but had less influence than n and t the spatial distributions of the accuracy of ss and penpan models are presented in fig 16 it can be seen from the figure that the ss model had more accurate estimates than the penpan model as for the spatial differences both models performed better in smz and performed relatively poorer in tcz average performance of the models in each climatic zones is showed in table 2 as seen from the table data driven models with complete inputs had the highest accuracy in each climatic zone with average rrmse ranging 12 6 15 2 13 2 14 6 and 12 8 15 2 ns ranging 0 909 0 936 0 885 0 941 and 0 901 0 938 mae ranging 11 7 20 0 mm m 11 9 18 4 mm m and 12 1 18 6 mm m for the three models respectively relatively good estimates could be obtained from models with at least n and t as inputs including models with n t and rh as inputs n t and u2 as inputs and n and t as inputs for data driven models with one single variable as model input the best performance could be obtained for models only with t as input which were elm8 pso ann8 and ga ann8 followed by models with only n as input including elm7 pso ann7 and ga ann7 all the models with rh elm6 pso ann6 and ga ann6 or u2 elm9 pso ann9 and ga ann9 as input showed much poorer prediction accuracy these results further confirmed that maximum and minimum temperatures were the most significant variables to estimate epan by data driven models followed by n u2 and rh as for the ss and penpan models it could be found that the ss model generally performed better than the penpan model we further calculated the gpi value of each model at all stations and ranked the 29 models accordingly for a specific station the ranking of model with the highest gpi was no 1 and model with the lowest gpi was ranked as no 29 fig 17 shows the ranking of each model at all stations the figure indicated that elm1 pso ann1 and ga ann1 generally had the highest ranking at most stations which confirmed that the best results were obtained from data driven models with complete meteorological inputs as for the models with incomplete inputs elm2 pso ann2 ga ann2 elm3 pso ann3 ga ann3 elm4 pso ann4 and ga ann4 all had satisfactory rankings among the models with one single variable as input models with t as input had the highest ranking fig 18 shows the average overall model ranking in each climatic zone in each zone elm1 pso ann1 and ga ann1 had the best ranking among these three models elm1 had better performance in mpz and smz while pso ann1 had better results in tcz and tmz among the three input data driven models the best results were obtained by elm3 in mpz and smz elm2 in tcz and pso ann2 in tmz as for two input data driven models models with n and t as inputs showed much more accurate estimates and the best two input data driven model was pso ann4 in mpz and tcz elm4 in smz ga ann4 in tmz among the single data driven models models with t as input had the best prediction accuracy followed by n u2 and rh the best single data driven model was pso ann8 in mpz and smz ga ann8 in tcz and tmz comparing the ss and penpan with data driven models we can find that the data driven models with complete inputs were significantly better than the ss and penpan models in each climatic zone as for elm4 pso ann4 ga ann4 and ss models their performances were different in each climatic zone in mpz and tcz the ss model provided slightly better results than data driven models with n and t as inputs however elm4 and pso ann4 in smz and pso ann4 and ga ann4 in tmz provided slightly better results than the ss model it should be noted that the differences between the ss model and data driven models were minimal 5 discussions the present study found the data driven models with complete inputs had the best prediction accuracy and removing the climatic variables would reduce the models accuracy this indicated that the effect of each climatic variable on epan estimation was positive which agreed well with the results by wang et al 2017 evaporation represents the exchange of water and energy between land and atmosphere so this exchange process is greatly controlled by the environmental variables the present study found accuracy of data driven models is more sensitive to t among the four climatic variables tabari et al 2010 reported that t was the most influential parameter on epan estimation in western iran which was in accordance with our results the data driven models with only t as input provided satisfactory results thus the temperature based data driven models are particularly promising since air temperature data could be measured widely and easily around the world mendicino and senatore 2013 almorox et al 2015 feng et al 2017b combining the forecasted temperature and temperature based data driven models can also predict the future epan which is crucial for irrigation planning and water resource management air temperature and sunshine duration generally accounted for over 80 of evaporation process priestley and taylor 1972 samani 2000 martí et al 2015 we found the data driven models with n and t as inputs and the ss model all had relatively accurate estimates compared with the ss model data driven models with n and t as inputs only showed slightly better performance in some parts of china which can be due to the fact that the ss model was locally calibrated in the present study this is similar to the results reported by wang et al 2017 who found the data driven models generally provided better accuracy than the regression models but the ss model was favorable in some climatic zones of china compared with data driven models the ss model is much less complex and easier to implement thus the ss model can be preferred when only rs and t data are available although the penpan model is a physically based model with many climatic inputs it showed less accurate results than the ss model in the present study the global and diffuse solar radiation data required in the penpan model was calculated from other climatic variables which may thus decrease the accuracy of the penpan model it should be noted that there were only 123 and 17 stations recording global and diffuse solar radiation in china respectively chen et al 2004 li et al 2012 thus the requirement of diffuse solar radiation in calculating epan by the penpan model reduced its universality shirsath and singh 2010 also reported that the ss model was better than the penpan model in india comparison of models indicated that the performance of a specific model varied in different climatic zones for the complete input scenario elm1 and ga ann1 showed better prediction capability in mpz than the other climatic zones and all the three models provided less accurate results in smz this variation can be also found for the other models although the models provided different performances in different climatic zones data driven models with complete climatic data as inputs generally provided the best results and elm1 performed slightly better than the other two data driven models with complete climatic data the temperature based data driven models are thus recommended for epan estimation when the other climatic data are missing although data driven models can accurately model epan in different climatic zones of china the models have no physical basis and belong to a kind of black box models kisi and cimen 2009 tabari et al 2012 furthermore we only evaluated the model performance over the year however the model performances may differ in different seasons especially in summer and winter further study is thus needed to analyze the model performance in different seasons 6 conclusion the present study proposed three data driven models elm pso ann and ga ann for modeling epan from different climatic parameters as inputs including n t rh and u2 the proposed data driven models along with the calibrated empirical ss model and physically based penpan models were evaluated and compared at 178 meteorological stations across different climatic zones of china the results showed that data driven models with complete climatic inputs had more accurate estimates indicating that the effect of each climatic parameter on epan estimation was positive air temperature was the most sensitive parameter to data driven models followed by n u2 and rh under the same input condition data driven models showed slightly better performance in smz and tmz while the ss model provided slightly better results in mpz and tcz thus the ss model can be preferred when only rs and t data are available in mpz and tcz since the ss model is much less complex and easier to implement although the penpan model was a physically based model its performance was relatively less accurate than the ss model and data driven models with same data inputs generally the elm1 model provided the best accuracy which was thus recommended for epan estimation when all the climatic data are available the temperature based data driven models showed satisfactory results among which pso ann was recommended in mpz and smz and ga ann was recommended in tcz and tmz when the other climatic data are missing acknowledgements we

particle swarm optimization pso ann and genetic algorithm ga ann were trained with nine input combinations of climatic variables the performance of the 27 proposed models along with the empirical stephens and stewart ss and physically based penpan models were investigated and compared using relative root mean square error rrmse nash sutcliffe coefficient ns and mean absolute error mae the three statistical indicators were further normalized to global performance indicator gpi by which all the evaluated models can be easily ranked the results showed that the data driven models with complete inputs generally obtained more accurate epan estimation where the elm model with full input data provided the best accuracy with average rrmse of 12 5 15 2 ns of 0 909 0 936 and mae of 11 7 19 9 mm m air temperature was found to be the most influential parameter to data driven models followed by sunshine duration wind speed and relative humidity the ss model provided slightly better results in mpz and tcz and slightly less accurate results in smz and tmz compared with the data driven models under the same input conditions overall elm was recommended as the best model for epan estimation when all the selected climatic data are available while temperature based pso ann is recommended in mpz and smz and temperature based ga ann is recommended in tcz and tmz when the other climatic data are missing keywords pan evaporation data driven models model performance assessment stephens and stewart model penpan model china 1 introduction pan evaporation epan is a crucial indicator of atmospheric evaporative demand yang and yang 2012 liu and sun 2016 which can reflect the status of global hydrological cycle under climate change held and soden 2006 roderick et al 2014 accurate estimation of epan is of importance for sustainable management of water resources the direct measurement of epan is both spatially and temporally restricted due to deficient instruments and practical issues kisi 2006 shiri et al 2014 therefore many methods have been proposed to indirectly estimate epan from meteorological variables such as the empirical stephens and stewart ss model physically based penpan model and data driven models kim and kim 2008 the penpan model was developed originally from the penman s combination equation and has been widely adopted for determining epan in china yang and yang 2012 modified the penpan model from the class a pan to estimate chinese d20 pan evaporation and quantify the contributions of climatic factors at 54 meteorological stations across china liu and sun 2016 used the penpan model to evaluate the performance of global climate models in terms of their capability to project annual seasonal and monthly statistics of epan in china li et al 2013 analyzed epan dynamics in the hyper arid region of china based on the results of penpan model xie et al 2015 modified the penpan model to estimate chinese d20 pan evaporation and assess the attribution of epan dynamics on the tibetan plateau during the last decades data driven approaches have been successfully applied in a sizable number of fields including hydrology many studies have evaluated the performance of data driven models for epan estimation in different regions around the world and the most widely used data driven model was artificial neural networks ann sudheer et al 2002 applied a multi layer perceptrons with backpropagation training algorithm to estimate epan and found that it provided favorable results chang et al 2010 developed a self organizing map neural networks to estimate daily epan kim et al 2012 used multilayer perceptron neural networks mlp nn generalized regression neural networks grnn and support vector machine neural networks svm nn to estimate daily epan in different climatic zones of republic of korea and iran and found svm nn performed better than mlp nn and grnn kisi 2013 proposed evolutionary neural networks enn for modeling monthly epan in mediterranean region of turkey and compared its performance with fuzzy genetic fg neuro fuzzy anfis ann and ss models the results indicated that the enn model had better prediction capacity than the fg anfis ann and ss models more recently some new data driven models have been developed for modeling epan guven and kisi 2013 compared the linear genetic programming lgp fg anfis ann and ss methods for estimating epan and found the lgp models outperformed the other models wang et al 2017 investigated the performance of six data driven models including mlp grnn fg least square support vector machine lssvm multivariate adaptive regression spline mars adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems with grid partition anfis gp and two regression multiple linear regression mlr and ss models in predicting monthly epan at eight meteorological stations of china the results showed that the models exhibited different results in different climates and the mlp model was generally better than the other models at most studied stations although the data driven models have been extensively adopted for epan estimation their performances across different climatic zones of china have been seldom reported wang et al 2017 especially at national scale in the present study three data driven models with different input combinations of climatic variables were developed and their performances were further compared against the empirical stephens and stewart model and physically based penpan model at 178 meteorological stations across different climatic zones of china the main objective was to investigate the applicability of the proposed data driven models in epan prediction with different climatic inputs at a national scale and recommend the optimal performing models in different climatic zones of china 2 study area and data collection 2 1 study area the mainland china generally has five climatic zones song et al 2011 fig 1 including the mountain plateau zone mpz the temperate continental zone tcz the temperate monsoon zone tmz the subtropical monsoon zone smz and the tropical monsoon zone in consideration of the significantly smaller land area and number of meteorological stations compared with the other climatic zones the tropical monsoon zone was incorporated into the smz for data analysis fan et al 2016 due to the data availability hong kong macao and taiwan were not considered in the present study the mpz covers the qinghai tibetan plateau and is characterized as a semi humid region with annual mean air temperature rainfall and epan of 3 2 c 414 mm and 1751 mm respectively fig 2 the tcz covers the northwest and north china which is characterized as an arid region with annual mean air temperature and rainfall of 7 2 c and 252 mm respectively it should be noted that annual mean epan in tcz is about 2030 mm which is approximately eight times amount of annual rainfall the tmz covers the northeast china and north china plain characterized as a semi arid region with annual mean air temperature rainfall and epan of 10 9 c 660 mm and 1587 mm respectively the smz covers most part of southern china characterized as a humid region with annual mean air temperature rainfall and epan of 17 7 c 1330 mm and 1448 mm respectively the spatial distribution of seasonal and annual epan in different climatic zones of china is presented in fig 3 with regard to the seasonal changes epan values in spring and summer were significantly higher than those in autumn and winter as for spatial differences tcz had the biggest epan values followed by mpz and tmz while smz showed the smallest epan values 2 2 data collection the d20 pan 0 20 m in diameter was widely used to measure epan in china from 1950s and has been replaced by another type of pan e601 pan 0 62 m in diameter from 2001 liu and sun 2016 among 824 meteorological stations in china some stations don t have epan measurements and some stations don t have long time series epan data considering the data availability and computation cost monthly epan and climatic data including maximum tmax minimum tmin air temperature at 2 m height mean relative humidity rh wind speed at 10 m height u10 and sunshine duration at 178 meteorological stations from 1961 to 2001 were used in the present study although global solar radiation is widely used and more accurate for evaporation estimation kisi 2013 fan et al 2018a there are only 123 stations with global solar radiation measurements in china fan and thomas 2018 fan et al 2018b in this way the coefficients of the angstrom prescott model for most weather stations have to be obtained from the other stations by using the interpolation methods thus the induced errors from calculated solar radiation data by the angstrom prescott equation may lead to large uncertainty in data driven models liu et al 2012 therefore the measured sunshine duration rather than the calculated or measured global solar radiation was used to train the data driven models in the present study geographical distribution of the selected meteorological stations is presented in fig 1 the data were provided and rigorously quality controlled by the china meteorological administration http data cma cn wind speed at 2 m height u2 was calculated from u10 data and mean air temperature ta was estimated by averaging tmax and tmin allen et al 1998 the d20 pan was made of copper 0 2 m in diameter and 0 1 m in depth and was placed 0 7 m above the ground to avoid birds drinking water from the pan a rim was built on the top of the pan yang and yang 2012 compared with the class a pan the d20 pan was smaller in size and contained less amount of water which resulted in a higher ratio of heat being transferred between the pan and the surrounding environment mcvicar et al 2007 yang and yang 2012 more details of the d20 pan are referred in yang and yang 2012 3 methods 3 1 extreme learning machine huang et al 2006 firstly developed extreme learning machine elm which was considered as a simple learning algorithm for single hidden layer feed forward neural networks slfn huang et al 2006 feng et al 2016 elm does not require too much human intervention and performs better than the traditional algorithms with faster running speed generally elm models consist of three layers input layer hidden layer and output layer which are connected by neurons fig 4 in the present study the input layer has m neurons corresponding to m input variables the hidden layer has l neurons and the output layer has only one neuron corresponding to the output variable epan the advantages of elm are 1 the hidden layer does not need to be tuned and 2 the learning speed is much faster than traditional feedforward neural networks abdullah et al 2015 more details regarding elm can be found in abdullah et al 2015 yaseen et al 2016 and feng et al 2017a 3 2 artificial neural networks artificial neural networks ann is an information processing system rajaee and shahabi 2016 ravansalar et al 2017 which is one of the most widely utilized data driven models it begins with data collection learning and adaption then pattern recognition and finally targeting the desired function by assessing various weights abdullah et al 2015 similar to the elm structure fig 4 an ann model also consists of three layers i e the input hidden and output layers there are various types of ann structural architecture among which the three layers back propagation bp algorithm with only one hidden layer is most commonly used in recent years juma et al 2014 ravansalar et al 2017 and it was thus selected as the bp neural networks in the present study bp algorithm is a typical gradient descent algorithm of which the major problems are easily getting stuck in a local minimum and overtraining kim and kim 2008 feng et al 2016 thus particle swarm optimization pso and genetic algorithm ga were introduced to optimize ann and then developed pso ann and ga ann respectively 3 2 1 particle swarm optimization pso is a stochastic optimization technique which was developed from collaborative behavior of biological populations in pso each particle with a fitness value is referred to an individual in a swarm nedic et al 2014 for each pso iteration k the position xi and velocity vi of particle i are updated by 1 x i k 1 x i k v i k 1 v i k 1 ω v i k c 1 r 1 i k p i k x i k c 2 r 2 i k g k x i k where ω is the inertia weight r 1 i k and r 2 i k are random values between 0 1 c 1 and c 2 are acceleration coefficients p i k is best position achieved by the particle itself so far g k is the best position achieved so far by whole swarm fig 5 shows the flowchart of the pso ann model more details of pso can be found in nedic et al 2014 3 2 2 genetic algorithm darwin s theory of evolution is the basic principle of ga which operates with a set of chromosome called population nedic et al 2014 the typical process of ga contains five procedures including initialization of population evaluation fitness selection crossover and mutation in this study absolute error was utilized as the fitness value to assess the capacity of ga 2 f k i 1 n abs y i o i where yi is the predicted output value of individual i oi is the desired output value of individual i k is the coefficient there are various methods for the selection of ga and the roulette was used in the current study thus the selection probability is calculated as 3 f i k f i 4 p i f i j 1 n f j where fi is the fitness value of individual i p i is the selection probability individual i n is the population size the crossover procedure for kth chromosome ak and lth chromosome al is defined as 5 a kj a kj 1 b a lj b a lj a lj 1 b a kj b where is a random value between 0 1 the jth chromosome of individual i was selected for mutation 6 a ij a ij a ij a max r 2 1 g g max 2 r 0 5 a ij a min a ij r 2 1 g g max 2 r 0 5 where a max and a min are the maximum and minimum of chromosome aij r 2 is a random value g is the current iterations number g max is the iterations number r is a random value between 0 1 the flowchart of ga ann model is presented in fig 6 3 3 penpan model the penpan model was developed from the modified penman model which was used for the calculation of open water evaporation penman 1948 in the penpan model epan is estimated as the sum of the radiative and aerodynamic terms rotstayn et al 2006 yang and yang 2012 7 e pan δ r n δ a γ λ a γ δ a γ f q u v p d where δ is the slope of the saturated vapor pressure kpa k 1 λ is the latent heat of vaporization of water mj kg 1 γ is psychometric constant kpa k 1 rn is the net radiation mj m2 d 1 fq u is the vapor transfer function kg m 2 d 1 kpa vpd is the vapor pressure deficit at 2 m kpa a is a constant with value of 5 for chinese d20 pan yang and yang 2012 detailed calculation procedures of penpan model can be found in yang and yang 2012 the calculation of epan by the penpan model requires many meteorological variables including air temperature relative humidity wind speed global and diffuse solar radiation in the present study global solar radiation was estimated from sunshine duration data through angstrom prescott model allen et al 1998 feng et al 2017b fan et al 2018b and the constants of as and bs in angstrom prescott model were calibrated according to liu et al 2010 with average as and bs of 0 23 and 0 58 for the mpz 0 20 and 0 56 for the tcz 0 16 and 0 56 for the smz and 0 17 and 0 55 for the tmz respectively fan et al 2016 diffuse solar radiation was estimated from sunshine duration air temperature and relative humidity data through the model proposed by li et al 2012 3 4 stephens and stewart model stephens and stewart ss model is an empirical function of epan with global solar radiation and air temperature 8 e pan a b t a r s where a and b are constants rs is the global solar radiation mj m 2 d 1 ta is the mean air temperature c 3 5 model training calibrating and testing program codes were written in matlab to develop the three data driven models nine input combinations of meteorological variables were utilized to train the elm ga ann and pso ann models details of the input combinations are presented in table 1 three data driven models with nine input combinations were trained thus a total of 27 data driven models were developed data from 1961 to 1990 were used to train the models while data from 1991 to 2001 were utilized to assess the models thus there were 360 patterns 30 years 12 months of training data and 132 patterns 11 years 12 months of testing data as for the empirical ss model which was originated from the jensen and haise 1963 method epan estimates from the model might become negative for continental or alpine winter conditions thus the constants of a and b of the model were calibrated from the training data by least square method at each station although a k fold assessment of the models should be applied to evaluate the models shiri et al 2014 2015 feng et al 2017c the present study only conducted a hold out validation of the models due to impracticality of k fold assessment resulted by the large dataset used monthly data of 178 stations during 1961 2001 3 6 performance evaluation relative root mean square error rrmse nash sutcliffe coefficient ns and mean absolute error mae were applied to assess the models shiri et al 2015 feng et al 2017c 9 rrmse 1 m i 1 m y i x i 2 x 100 10 mae 1 m i 1 m x i y i 11 ns 1 i 1 m y i x i 2 i 1 m x i x 2 where xi and yi denote the measured and estimated values respectively x is the mean value of xi rrmse ranges from 0 perfect fit to the worst fit mae ranges from 0 perfect fit to the worst fit and ns ranges from 1 perfect fit to the worst fit it is challenging to compare or rank a large number of models with different statistical indicators therefore we utilized a global performance indicator gpi which demonstrates multiplication of all statistical indicators applied to prevent this problem firstly values of all indicators were scaled to prevent significant influence of any particular statistical indicator 12 x scaled x 0 x min x max x min where x scaled x 0 x min and x max are scaled value real value minimum value and maximum value of the specific indicator respectively thus the minimum and maximum scaled values of each indicator are 0 and 1 respectively despotovic et al 2015 then the gpi for model i is calculated as 13 gp i i j 1 3 α j g j y ij where α j is a constant with value of 1 for rrmse and mae j 1 2 1 for ns j 3 g j represents the median of scaled values of statistical indicator j y ij represents the scaled value of the statistical indicator j for model i greater gpi values indicate the better precision of the model this method normalizes three different statistical indicators as only one individual indicator thus it is much easier to compare the model performance in the present study the highest value of gpi at a station represents the best performance of the corresponding model and this model is thus ranked as the no 1 model at that station on the contrary the lowest value of gpi at a station indicates the worst performance of the corresponding model which is ranked as the no 29 model at that station 4 results spatial distributions of the performance of data driven models with all climatic variables as inputs elm1 pso ann1 and ga ann1 models are presented in fig 7 as shown in the fig 7 the three models all performed well for estimating epan at most stations with rrmse less than 17 8 ns over 0 85 and mae less than 22 5 mm m generally there were certain spatial differences in the model accuracy where the models showed relatively better accuracy in tcz and smz but relatively worse performance in tmz especially in north china plain the performances of elm2 pso ann2 and ga ann2 models are presented in fig 8 the three models were trained with sunshine duration air temperature and relative humidity data it can be seen from fig 8 that the three models all performed well for the estimation of epan at the majority of stations with rrmse less than 19 4 ns over 0 82 and mae less than 30 1 mm m generally the models showed relatively better accuracy in smz relatively worse performance in mpz compared with models with complete inputs elm1 pso ann1 and ga ann1 models with n t and rh as inputs showed slightly poorer performance indicating that removing u2 from model inputs didn t significantly reduce the prediction accuracy of the models spatial distributions of the accuracy of elm3 pso ann3 and ga ann3 models are presented in fig 9 the three models were trained with sunshine duration air temperature and wind speed as inputs the figure illustrated that all the three models had good accuracy for modeling epan at the majority of stations with rrmse less than 22 4 ns over 0 82 and mae less than 28 4 mm m the models had relatively better performance in smz relatively worse performance in mpz and tcz compared with elm1 pso ann1 and ga ann1 models models with n t and u2 as inputs also showed slightly poorer performance which indicated that removing rh didn t significantly reduce the accuracy of the models fig 10 illustrates the spatial distributions of the performance of elm5 pso ann5 and ga ann5 models which were trained with sunshine duration and air temperature as inputs the figure demonstrated that all the three models had good performance for modeling epan at the majority of stations with rrmse less than 25 6 ns over 0 75 and mae less than 31 2 mm m the models had relatively better performance in smz and tcz relatively worse performance in some stations of mpz compared with elm1 pso ann1 and ga ann1 models models with n and t as inputs also showed slightly poorer performance which indicated that removing rh and u2 didn t significantly reduced the accuracy of the models thus n and t were key input variables for models spatial distributions of the accuracy of elm5 pso ann5 and ga ann5 models are presented in fig 11 the three models were trained with relative humidity and wind speed as model inputs the figure showed that all the three models exhibited poor performance for epan estimation at the majority of stations with rrmse over 40 0 ns less than 0 45 and mae over 52 3 mm m the models had relatively better performance in some stations of smz located in southwest china with rrmse less than 25 0 ns over 0 65 and mae less than 34 0 mm m compared with elm1 pso ann1 and ga ann1 models models with rh and u2 as inputs had much poorer performance which indicated n and t were crucial for the modeling of epan spatial distributions of the accuracy of elm6 pso ann6 and ga ann6 models are presented in fig 12 the three models were trained only with relative humidity as input the figure illustrated that all the three models had much poor performance for estimating epan at the majority of stations with rrmse over 31 3 ns less than 0 24 and mae over 61 8 mm m however the models performed relatively better in several stations of smz located in southwest china with rrmse less than 31 3 ns over 0 62 and mae less than 34 1 mm m fig 13 shows spatial distributions of the performance of elm7 pso ann7 and ga ann7 models the three models were trained only with sunshine duration as input it can be seen from the figure that all the three models had relatively poor performance for modeling epan at the majority of stations with rrmse over 31 7 ns less than 0 50 and mae over 23 8 mm m however the models had relatively better performance in many stations of smz located in southern china with rrmse less than 24 7 ns over 0 75 and mae less than 23 8 mm m spatial distributions of the performance of elm8 pso ann8 and ga ann8 models are given in fig 14 the three models were trained only with air temperature as input including maximum and minimum air temperatures as shown in the figure all the three models had relatively good performance for modeling epan at many stations in china with rrmse less than 19 7 ns over 0 87 and mae below 21 3 mm m generally the models had relatively better performance in smz and relatively poor accuracy in tcz and tmz the three models had better performance than the models with only rh elm6 pso ann6 and ga ann6 or n elm7 pso ann7 and ga ann7 as model input confirming that the model accuracy was more affected by t compared with rh and n fig 15 presents the accuracy of elm9 pso ann9 and ga ann9 models the models were trained only with wind speed as input as shown in the figure all the models had less accurate results for epan modeling at most of stations with rrmse over 30 8 ns less than 0 47 and mae over 33 5 mm m however the models performed relatively better in some stations of mpz and smz located in qinghai tibetan plateau and southwest china respectively the models with only u2 as input had slightly better accuracy than those with only rh elm6 pso ann6 and ga ann6 but had less accuracy than those with only n elm7 pso ann7 and ga ann7 or t elm8 pso ann8 and ga ann8 as input indicating that u2 had more influence on model accuracy than rh but had less influence than n and t the spatial distributions of the accuracy of ss and penpan models are presented in fig 16 it can be seen from the figure that the ss model had more accurate estimates than the penpan model as for the spatial differences both models performed better in smz and performed relatively poorer in tcz average performance of the models in each climatic zones is showed in table 2 as seen from the table data driven models with complete inputs had the highest accuracy in each climatic zone with average rrmse ranging 12 6 15 2 13 2 14 6 and 12 8 15 2 ns ranging 0 909 0 936 0 885 0 941 and 0 901 0 938 mae ranging 11 7 20 0 mm m 11 9 18 4 mm m and 12 1 18 6 mm m for the three models respectively relatively good estimates could be obtained from models with at least n and t as inputs including models with n t and rh as inputs n t and u2 as inputs and n and t as inputs for data driven models with one single variable as model input the best performance could be obtained for models only with t as input which were elm8 pso ann8 and ga ann8 followed by models with only n as input including elm7 pso ann7 and ga ann7 all the models with rh elm6 pso ann6 and ga ann6 or u2 elm9 pso ann9 and ga ann9 as input showed much poorer prediction accuracy these results further confirmed that maximum and minimum temperatures were the most significant variables to estimate epan by data driven models followed by n u2 and rh as for the ss and penpan models it could be found that the ss model generally performed better than the penpan model we further calculated the gpi value of each model at all stations and ranked the 29 models accordingly for a specific station the ranking of model with the highest gpi was no 1 and model with the lowest gpi was ranked as no 29 fig 17 shows the ranking of each model at all stations the figure indicated that elm1 pso ann1 and ga ann1 generally had the highest ranking at most stations which confirmed that the best results were obtained from data driven models with complete meteorological inputs as for the models with incomplete inputs elm2 pso ann2 ga ann2 elm3 pso ann3 ga ann3 elm4 pso ann4 and ga ann4 all had satisfactory rankings among the models with one single variable as input models with t as input had the highest ranking fig 18 shows the average overall model ranking in each climatic zone in each zone elm1 pso ann1 and ga ann1 had the best ranking among these three models elm1 had better performance in mpz and smz while pso ann1 had better results in tcz and tmz among the three input data driven models the best results were obtained by elm3 in mpz and smz elm2 in tcz and pso ann2 in tmz as for two input data driven models models with n and t as inputs showed much more accurate estimates and the best two input data driven model was pso ann4 in mpz and tcz elm4 in smz ga ann4 in tmz among the single data driven models models with t as input had the best prediction accuracy followed by n u2 and rh the best single data driven model was pso ann8 in mpz and smz ga ann8 in tcz and tmz comparing the ss and penpan with data driven models we can find that the data driven models with complete inputs were significantly better than the ss and penpan models in each climatic zone as for elm4 pso ann4 ga ann4 and ss models their performances were different in each climatic zone in mpz and tcz the ss model provided slightly better results than data driven models with n and t as inputs however elm4 and pso ann4 in smz and pso ann4 and ga ann4 in tmz provided slightly better results than the ss model it should be noted that the differences between the ss model and data driven models were minimal 5 discussions the present study found the data driven models with complete inputs had the best prediction accuracy and removing the climatic variables would reduce the models accuracy this indicated that the effect of each climatic variable on epan estimation was positive which agreed well with the results by wang et al 2017 evaporation represents the exchange of water and energy between land and atmosphere so this exchange process is greatly controlled by the environmental variables the present study found accuracy of data driven models is more sensitive to t among the four climatic variables tabari et al 2010 reported that t was the most influential parameter on epan estimation in western iran which was in accordance with our results the data driven models with only t as input provided satisfactory results thus the temperature based data driven models are particularly promising since air temperature data could be measured widely and easily around the world mendicino and senatore 2013 almorox et al 2015 feng et al 2017b combining the forecasted temperature and temperature based data driven models can also predict the future epan which is crucial for irrigation planning and water resource management air temperature and sunshine duration generally accounted for over 80 of evaporation process priestley and taylor 1972 samani 2000 martí et al 2015 we found the data driven models with n and t as inputs and the ss model all had relatively accurate estimates compared with the ss model data driven models with n and t as inputs only showed slightly better performance in some parts of china which can be due to the fact that the ss model was locally calibrated in the present study this is similar to the results reported by wang et al 2017 who found the data driven models generally provided better accuracy than the regression models but the ss model was favorable in some climatic zones of china compared with data driven models the ss model is much less complex and easier to implement thus the ss model can be preferred when only rs and t data are available although the penpan model is a physically based model with many climatic inputs it showed less accurate results than the ss model in the present study the global and diffuse solar radiation data required in the penpan model was calculated from other climatic variables which may thus decrease the accuracy of the penpan model it should be noted that there were only 123 and 17 stations recording global and diffuse solar radiation in china respectively chen et al 2004 li et al 2012 thus the requirement of diffuse solar radiation in calculating epan by the penpan model reduced its universality shirsath and singh 2010 also reported that the ss model was better than the penpan model in india comparison of models indicated that the performance of a specific model varied in different climatic zones for the complete input scenario elm1 and ga ann1 showed better prediction capability in mpz than the other climatic zones and all the three models provided less accurate results in smz this variation can be also found for the other models although the models provided different performances in different climatic zones data driven models with complete climatic data as inputs generally provided the best results and elm1 performed slightly better than the other two data driven models with complete climatic data the temperature based data driven models are thus recommended for epan estimation when the other climatic data are missing although data driven models can accurately model epan in different climatic zones of china the models have no physical basis and belong to a kind of black box models kisi and cimen 2009 tabari et al 2012 furthermore we only evaluated the model performance over the year however the model performances may differ in different seasons especially in summer and winter further study is thus needed to analyze the model performance in different seasons 6 conclusion the present study proposed three data driven models elm pso ann and ga ann for modeling epan from different climatic parameters as inputs including n t rh and u2 the proposed data driven models along with the calibrated empirical ss model and physically based penpan models were evaluated and compared at 178 meteorological stations across different climatic zones of china the results showed that data driven models with complete climatic inputs had more accurate estimates indicating that the effect of each climatic parameter on epan estimation was positive air temperature was the most sensitive parameter to data driven models followed by n u2 and rh under the same input condition data driven models showed slightly better performance in smz and tmz while the ss model provided slightly better results in mpz and tcz thus the ss model can be preferred when only rs and t data are available in mpz and tcz since the ss model is much less complex and easier to implement although the penpan model was a physically based model its performance was relatively less accurate than the ss model and data driven models with same data inputs generally the elm1 model provided the best accuracy which was thus recommended for epan estimation when all the climatic data are available the temperature based data driven models showed satisfactory results among which pso ann was recommended in mpz and smz and ga ann was recommended in tcz and tmz when the other climatic data are missing acknowledgements we

the responding morphological evolutionary processes of active yrsd over a period of 20 years between 1996 and 2016 results show that the new discharge regime is strongly interfered by the water sediment regulation scheme wsrs characterized by a more drastic decline of sediment load than that of water discharge more harmonious relationship between water and sediment discharges in the lower reach of the river to the sea coarser sediment delivery and low suspended sediment concentration ssc we identified inverse erosion accretion trends in the subaqueous region net accretion of 0 15 m yr in the active yellow river mouth ayrm and severe erosion of 0 1 m yr in the gudong littoral zone gdlz as the primary sink for sediment delivery ayrm received approximately 68 of sediment delivery during the study period and sedimentation was mainly occurred in the shallower area where water depth was less than 10 m in addition recent morphological evolution of ayrm is found to have undergone through four stages namely moderate accretion 1996 2002 rapid accretion 2002 2007 reduced accretion 2007 2015 and rapid erosion 2015 2016 the new regime of riverine delivery presents multiple spatiotemporal scales in shaping deltaic morphology compared with the previous research we present the morphological evolution of deltaic system over decadal timescale is strongly influenced by reduction of sediment supply derived from basin scale human impacts and the variability of subaqueous portion during the study period is closely related to inter annual variability of river input besides the building of ayrm is shaped by event scale wsrs induced floodwater and decade scale change of sediment pathway governed by frequent mouth channel migration the results show for the first time that ayrm has experienced a significant erosion since the implementation of wsrs with a decline of 99 sediment delivery in 2016 compared to the natural mode during 1950s the results also indicate that to maintain the erosion accretion balance of ayrm an estimation of 41 4 62 3 mt yr sediment delivery should be kept due to the fluvial regime change from the natural to the highly human regulated modes the ayrm as well as the whole yrsd is expected to be transforming from the accretion to erosion states keywords active yellow river mouth new regime of wsrs morphological variability accretion and erosion human interference 1 introduction due to naturalflat terrain fertile soils and abundant water resources over half a billion people densely inhabited in river deltas during the anthropocene syvitski et al 2009 kuenzer et al 2014 with rapid population and economic growth over the last century anthropogenic interventions drastically intensified in river basins upstream damming flow diversion and intensified water consumption in river catchment dominated the reduction of river input in recent decades sanchez arcilla et al 1998 carriquiry and sánchez 1999 vörösmarty et al 2003 walling 2006 as a result river deltas today are facing increasing challenges in stabilizing deltaic morphology and shoreline as there have been severe coastal land loss in mississippi delta and nile delta stanley 1996 blum and roberts 2009 large scale shoreline retreat in mekong delta anthony et al 2015 recession and land subsidence in yangtze delta yang et al 2011a and transformation from accretion to erosion in pearl river delta dai et al 2008 wu et al 2016 therefore scientists and engineers have considerably expanded monitoring and impact studies on sustainability of river deltas giosan et al 2014 which has made the latest regime of river input and responded geomorphic and environmental implications in worldwide river deltas a hotspot in hydrologic and coastal research similar to other megadeltas morphologic evolution of yellow river huanghe delta is significantly impacted by human activities intensified human intervention in the river catchment induced sharp decline in river input in recent years wang et al 2006a 2007 syvitski and saito 2007 miao et al 2011 liu et al 2012 in addition there are extensive engineering activities influencing the development of delta such as human avulsion engineering projects for oilfield protection dikes and levees for flood control groynes and breakwaters for storm surge defense and coastal protection bi et al 2014 zheng et al 2018 other economic activities including oil exploiting land reclamation and aquaculture are rapidly developing which also have profound impacts for ecosystem vulnerability and landscape change yue et al 2003 zhang et al 2017 chi et al 2018 fan et al 2018a thus it is urgent for investigations to be carried out to maintain the delta sustainability by keeping the right balance between human intervention and natural forcing on the other hand yellow river delta is distinctive from other megadeltas with its developing pattern the delta has been formed as a fan shaped landscape with frequent deltaic channel avulsions since 1855 until 2016 there have been 11 major channel avulsions and frequent channel bifurcations zheng et al 2018 thereafter the yellow river delta has high spatial variations in evolutionary processes rapid accretion occurring in active yellow river mouth ayrm with sufficient sediment supply and erosion in abandoned river mouth due to sediment starvation li et al 2000 chu et al 2006 cui and li 2011 xing et al 2016 multi year estimation indicates that the sediment delivered to the delta annually is in the range of 1 08 billion tons milliman and meade 1983 which makes it one of the most rapid deposition center in the world zhou et al 2015 however associated with the reduction of river input in recent decades the aggradation rates of ayrm has slowed down especially after 1996 when the channel artificial diversion at qing 8 section cui and li 2011 jiang et al 2017 wu et al 2017 in addition the implementation of water sediment regulation scheme wsrs since 2002 has transformed the river discharge to a highly human altered regime the natural seasonal variability of river discharge being overridden by the prior designed short term substantial river discharge delivery fourteen years after the operation of this basin scale water regulation program it is perhaps the time to re estimate the new regime of human activity derived riverine delivery and consequent changes in coastal environment in yellow river delta numerous studies have been conducted in the primary role of wsrs in promoting the spread of nutrients wang et al 2017b reshaping shoreline dynamics cui and li 2011 kong et al 2015a fan et al 2018b changing land areas in subaerial delta xu 2008 bi et al 2014 jiang et al 2017 wu et al 2017 and dominating evolution processes of active yellow river subaqueous delta yrsd specifically bi et al 2014 found the profile slope of subaqueous delta increasing as delta advancing seaward near the active river mouth wu et al 2017 considered the grain size of sediment delivery and reduction of river input as dominated factors driving morphological evolution in yrsd since the operation of wsrs however under recent man derived fluvial regime little is known about morphological adaption in the deposition area of wsrs delivered sediment suggested by wang et al 2017a in addition the spatial variability of active yrsd have been frequently ignored due to the lack of high resolution geometric survey data as the key element of land ocean interaction processes the active yrsd behavior to the altered fluvial regime needs further appreciation and evaluation thus in this study the variation of ayrm under the new regime of river input is examined based on high resolution bathymetric survey data in active yrsd from 1996 to 2016 and temporal changes in water and sediment delivery we first define the new regime of terrestrial delivery by comparing it with the previous river input from the point of statistical analysis then we analyze the different erosion accretion patterns in active yrsd including ayrm and gudong littoral zone gdlz and quantify finally we discuss the dominant factors of new discharge regime impacts on the deltaic behavior and provide recommendations for the yellow river management from the perspective of deltaic sedimentation system based on the better understanding of the recent morphologic variability corresponding to the human altered discharge regime gained from this study 2 regional setting the yellow river originates from qinghai tibet plateau and runs through loess plateau and north china plain successively finally emptying into the bohai sea exceeding its length with 5464 km and a river catchment of 7 52 105 km2 fig 1 a the upper reach of the yellow river is the main water source providing more than 90 of total water discharge but small amount of sediment because of the intensive erosion in loess plateau the middle reach becomes the primary source of suspended sediment dominating over 90 of total sediment load in the river drainage miao et al 2011 the lower reach channel is the sink of sediment from upstream especially coarse sediment for the gentle terrain and few tributaries in addition the riverbed of the lower reach is higher than the elevation of riverside and considered as hanging river there have been many flooding disasters in the lower reach drainage historically when peak flows bursting the riverbank during the flood season causing severe losses in the alluvial plain of the lower yellow river the modern yellow river delta has begun to build out rapidly since the yellow river breached at tongwaxiang and shifted from jiangsu province to the daqinghe river course entering into the bohai sea through shandong province chu et al 2006 deltaic channel shifted frequently at the apex of ninghai before 1953 and then it moved downstream to yuwa li et al 2001 peng et al 2010 since then the deltaic channel followed by shenxiangou channel 1953 1964 diaokouhe channel 1964 1976 qingshuigou channel 1976 present then artificially shifted at the qing 8 section in august 1996 as the present qingbacha mouth channel fig 1b due to the concerns of the stability of qingshuigou channel and decrease in the potential risk of flooding syvitski and saito 2007 peng et al 2010 we divide the active yrsd into sub regions of ayrm and gdlz according to different fluvial and marine dynamics and erosion accretion trends fig 1b the evolution process of ayrm is determined by collective long term erosion and short term rapid accretion during flood season within a year particularly after the implementation of wsrs during wsrs on average 20 days each year high concentration suspended sediment rapidly deposited within 10 m water depth in the river mouth due to the barrier effect of the tidal shear front on the river laden sediment dispersion bi et al 2010 wu et al 2015 while in other days especially in winter sediment resuspended mostly by storm waves and transported to offshore sea yang et al 2011b gudong oilfield is located in the northwest of ayrm fig 1b producing 30 million tons of oil per year ren and walker 1998 17 2 km long seawalls were constructed as relatively stable artificial coastline between 1985 and 1987 to protect the oilfield however there is huge spending every year to sustain the coastal protection near gudong but the deepest water depth near the seawall has exceeded 4 7 m by in situ observation in 2016 fig 1c the yrsd is dominated by irregular semi diurnal tide with mean tidal range of 0 6 0 8 m near the river mouth li et al 1998 tidal current is parallel to the coast which flows southward during flood tide and northward during ebb tide with the current speed of 1 0 2 0 m s wang et al 2010a the residual current averages 0 2 0 3 m s in surface layers driven by monsoon winds and fluvial discharge zhang et al 1990 waves off the river mouth is generally driven by southerly winds in summer and northeasterly winds in winter with an average wave height up to 1 5 m enhancing the resuspension of sediments in the littoral area of yellow river delta especially in shenxiangou old estuary and gudong nearshore chu et al 2006 sandy silt accounts for the largest proportion in seabed surface sediment type according to the classification of folk ren et al 2011 3 materials and methods 3 1 data

kendall 1975 which has been widely used to examine varying trend in hydrological and meteorological time series zhang et al 2008 zhao et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 dai et al 2015 to detect the decreasing trends in yellow river water and sediment delivery a positive value of the standardized statistics z indicates an upward varying trend and vice versa the null hypothesis of no trend is rejected if z greater than 1 96 at 0 05 significance level and a bigger absolute value of z is considered to reflect a stronger time series variability the kendall slope β for j i is calculated as β

shoreline is difficult to catch liu et al 2016 the normalized difference water index ndwi method mcfeeters 1996 which has been widely used in separating the subaerial landscape from water bodies is

regarded as the shoreline in different period elevations of waterlines based on the local datum at dongying port fig 1b are converted into national elevation datum by adding 100 cm being consistent with the elevation datum of subaqueous measurements combining the deltaic shoreline and field observation data we use kriging technique in arcgis 10 3 to interpolate the subaqueous deltaic topography with a cell resolution of 30 m 30 m the subaqueous morphological change δv in ayrm consists of common underwater topographic change δvsubaqueous and sediment delivery for land building δvsubaerial in

sea mann kendall mk test of annual variation trend indicates a significant decline in water discharge and sediment load delivered to the sea during 1950 2016 as recorded at lijin station the most seaward hydrological station 109 km from the active river mouth fig 2 a and table 2 in addition the decline in sediment delivery has been greater than water discharge due to the z value of the mk trend test in 6 55 and 7 30 respectively with the kendall slope of 6 53 108 m3 yr and 0 21 108 t yr pettitt test shows temporal abrupt change point occurred in 1985 of both time series in water and sediment discharge which indicates a different time series median occurring since 1986 compared to pre 1985 period fig 2b and c the average water discharge and sediment load shifted downward after the abrupt change point more than 63 and 76 this change point was probably associated with effective soil conservation practice in the middle reach and the closure of longyangxia reservoir 1986 wang et al 2007 xiaolangdi reservoir the most critical engineering project of yellow river during 2000s began to operate in 1999 correspondingly sediment delivery went on a decreasing trend with an average value of 1 20 108 t yr as a result of sediment retention behind dams whereas the average water discharging to the sea during 1986 1999 and 2000 2016 remained a relatively stable level with 150 155 108 m3 yr by basin scale flow regulation fig 2d the severe sediment starvation occurred in 2016 with the lowest level ever recorded at lijin with only 10 6 mt the insufficient sediment delivery was less than 1 of 1950s level which represents the natural fluvial mode despite the stepwise decline in river input influenced by human impacts the relationship between water and sediment discharge has greatly changed here we use the average annual incoming sediment coefficient ξa which reflects the relationship between incoming suspended sediment concentration cs and water amount qw 4 ξ a c s q w q s q w 2 between 1950 and 1985 the average incoming sediment coefficients at huayuankou and lijin were 0 021 and 0 024 respectively which markedly increased to 0 030 and 0 066 after the closure of liujiaxia reservoir fig 3 a it reflected the inconsistent relationship between water and sediment delivered to the lower reach and inevitably caused the decrease of sediment transport capacity and consequent heavy siltation in the lower reach riverbed in addition due to the drastic decline in water and sediment input no flow days appeared more frequently after 1986 in 1997 the length of riverbed drying up reached its peak level of 706 km and 226 no flow days peng et al 2010 to mitigate the excessive deposition state in the elevated riverbed in the lower reach the water sediment regulation scheme wsrs based at xiaolangdi reservoir was designed to regulate river discharge and began its operation in 2002 wang et al 2010b yu et al 2013 the released flood water over a limited 20 day period effectively scoured the riverbed of the lower reach and deeply improved the environment of lower reach especially after 2005 the ξa at huayuankou and lijin both decreased lower than 0 014 the critical value for erosion deposition trend in the lower reach suggested by hu 2005 indicating the siltation in the lower reach has transformed directly to the net erosion state on the other hand linear regression relationship between water and sediment discharge shares similar trend between 1950 and 1985 and 1986 1999 after the closure of xiaolangdi reservoir the gradient of trend line after 1999 is significantly lower than the pre 1999 level representing the relationship between water and sediment has completely changed into the harmonious with drastic decline in annual suspended sediment concentration the fourteen years successive operation of wsrs had profound impacts on hydrological processes and source to sink cycles from the lower reach to the river mouth the man made flood peaks during wsrs has distinctively changed the distribution of river input through a year by delivering about 30 annual water discharge and 50 annual sediment load in limited 20 days in addition the flow regulation successfully mitigated the excessive deposition state in the xiaolangdi reservoir and the elevated riverbed of yellow river lower reach which made the riverbed downstream the xiaolangdi becoming a new primary sediment source correspondingly the median grain size of input increased to 25 8 μm in the early stage of the operation of the wsrs 2002 2007 however the efficiency of lower reach scouring was slowed down since 2008 because most fine particles on the riverbed had been eroded and transported to the river mouth in the early years the average median grain size decreased to 20 1 μm in the late stage of wsrs 2008 2015 fig 4 a fig 4b shows a drastic decline in ssc peak value and significant seasonal migration since the completion of xiaolangdi reservoir the average ssc in flood season july october reached 31 6 kg m3 in pre 1999 and migrated to its peak value with 9 1 kg m3 during june july when the wsrs frequently operated 4 2 erosion deposition patterns in the active yellow river mouth to quantify the accurate morphological changes in ayrm bathymetric survey data combined with dem establishing is important thus eight subaqueous data sets from field observation which were conducted in different years during 1996 2016 are transformed into the same projected coordinates utm 50n with wgs84 datum based on the difference of dem model in adjacent years the erosion accretion area and volume are calculated separately which indicates the erosion accretion pattern in ayrm fig 5 and table 3 according to the volume change rates and evolution processes four major stages are generally divided by the initial implementation of wsrs 2002 mouth channel migration 2007 and the first interruption of wsrs 2016 in the initial years of qing 8 river mouth protruding prior to 2002 the subaqueous portion showed moderate accretion trend with 0 61 108 m3 yr and significant variance in evolution processes we observed rapid deposition appearing with the depo center located right in front of the river mouth during 1996 1998 severe erosion in 1998 2001 and accretion during 2001 2002 fig 5a b and c the unexpected sedimentation percentage in 1996 1998 was 153 presumably by the sufficient sediment source coming from southern old river mouth and the mouth channel riverbed as a result of the headward erosion additionally the receiving basin of underwater topography provided an ideal place for sedimentation because of the initial steep profile by contrast the sediment supply decreased in 1998 2001 due to the integrated effect from low precipitation and dam impoundment of the xiaolangdi reservoir the ayrm experienced an average erosion rate of 0 13 m yr particularly for the mouth bar area where erosion center is located table 3 at the beginning of the implementation of wsrs the considerable increase of sediment input induced rapid deposition during 2002 2007 with a rapid accretion trend at 0 93 108 m3 yr approximately 61 73 of total sediment delivery deposited in ayrm during this stage and most of them were found within 10 m water depth contour fig 5d and e as the river mouth shifted eastward during 2004 2007 the erosion center and depo center appeared simultaneously we observed the erosion center being around the left side of the sand spit near the river mouth where the water depth was shallower than 2 m with an average erosion rate of 2 91 m yr depo center shifted to the location just seaward of the entrance bar at around 10 m depth contour with an average vertical accretion rate of 3 14 m yr sediment deposited in the mouth bar area before 2004 can be more easily suspended by winter waves and transported by shore parallel currents because of the sediment transport pathways changing with the shift of river mouth at regional scale during the flood season in 2007 the yellow river mouth naturally shifted from eastward to northeastward leaving previous river mouth abandoned due to the lack of sediment supply during 2007 2011 depo and erosion centers interchanged the location with an average vertical rate of 1 53 m yr in abandoned erosion center and 1 49 m yr in depo center fig 5f this variation trend went on during 2011 2015 with a vertical erosion of erosion center 3 7 m and vertical accretion of depo center over 10 0 m fig 5g since the amount of sediment input decreased in 2007 2015 the deposition rate at this stage decreased to 0 57 108 m3 yr the 14 yr successive wsrs operation was first interrupted in 2016 because of the shortage of water discharge in the yellow river basin meanwhile the yellow river sediment load reached the lowest level of 10 6 mt in 2016 consequently approximately 65 of ayrm experienced erosion during 2015 2016 fig 5h net erosion volume reached 0 62 108 m3 and average vertical erosion rate in the study area exceeded 0 15 m table 3 it was the first time that ayrm experienced severe erosion since the implementation of wsrs overall the ayrm poses considerably varied trends as a result of inter annual variability in sediment input it is estimated that approximately 68 of overall sediment delivery contributed to subaerial building and subaqueous delta accretion in ayrm with net accretion rate 0 59 108 m3 yr and an average vertical accretion of 0 15 m yr fig 5i by comparing 20 yr net volume change rate of ayrm we find the evolution of ayrm experienced four stages i e moderate accretion 1996 2002 with 0 61 108 m3 yr rapid accretion 2002 2007 with 0 93 108 m3 yr reduced accretion 2007 2015 with 0 57 108 m3 yr and rapid erosion 2015 2016 with 0 53 108 m3 yr fig 5j 4 3 morphological change in gudong littoral zone the yellow river delta is home to the local shengli oilfield the second largest oilfield in china fig 6 a with sufficient supply of sediment in 1970s the coastline at gudong propagated seaward more than 5 km from 1976 to 1986 however since 1987 the coastline was subject to erosion due to the reduction of sediment supply an artificial coastal dike was first built to slow down the coastal erosion in 1987 three groins were successively built along gudong dike in 2000s fig 6b and c despite of the coastal defenses being built the overall gudong area continued to be in the state of erosion fig 6d during 1996 2016 more than 94 of gdlz suffered from erosion with an average erosion rate of 0 1 m yr table 3 the inter annual differences in erosion volume are believed to be determined by sediment delivery and the migration of river mouth as the volume for coastal erosion has decreased after the natural migration of river mouth in 2007 erosion rate increased during 2015 2016 in comparison with that in 2007 2015 since there was a significant reduction of the sediment delivery bi et al 2014 suggested a majority of suspended sediment from yellow river mouth were trapped by the groins where sediment transport pathway was intensively inhibited in addition waves driven by northeastward winter wind strengthened the sediment resuspension in gdlz which made gdlz becoming an intensive erosion region as the re suspended sediment might be transported through parallel tidal current to ayrm or offshore bathymetric cross shore transect in gdlz from 1976 to 2016 was also examined in this study to determine the temporal variation in subaqueous delta the slope of delta front shallower than 5 m water depth in gdlz shows gentle variation between 1976 and 1996 and falling from 0 64 to 0 39 during 1996 2016 fig 6e it should be noticed that the maximum erosion was distributed around the 2 m contour near gudong dike where vertical erosion exceeded 5 m fig 5i by contrast areas deeper than 5 m depth showed general accretion trend owing to the successive propagation of the active subaerial delta the transect selected was crossing the mouth bar area with water depth less than 1 m fig 6e black line 5 discussion 5 1 factors controlling the deltaic variability under the new fluvial regime 5 1 1 human activity induced decline in river discharge the delta morphologic processes are mainly dominated by terrestrial input tides wind waves storm surges and sea level conditions blum and roberts 2009 lamb et al 2012 hoitink et al 2017 adequate sediment input has direct and crucial impact on the building processes of fluvial dominated deltaic system with relative weak tidal forcing and wave actions previous studies have revealed the inter decadal variability of sediment accumulation rates in qingshuigou abandoned river mouth was 5 77 108 m3 yr during 1976 1985 3 80 108 m3 yr during 1986 1995 jiang et al 2017 and further decreased to 0 61 108 m3 yr since the river delivered by qingbacha mouth channel in 1996 similarly the deposition zone over 6 m in vertical accretion during 1996 2016 has drastically shrank to 44 3 km2 in contrast to an area of 183 06 km2 in qingshuigou old river mouth jiang et al 2017 moreover from 1996 to 2016 ayrm deposit rate in four stages had strong correlation with the inter annual variability of river input the ayrm generally remained accretion under the condition of river input in the first three stages while showing erosion in 2016 with the absence of sediment supply the littoral zone around 10 m contour relative to adjacent year is the most sensitive zone of accretion as the barrier effect of tidal shear front which is the convergence of sedimentation numerical models show the river input largely influence the front intensity but has little influence to front locations qiao et al 2008 which makes this convergence sedimentation center rather invariant in water depth reduction in sediment supply from yellow river to the sea is closely associated with human interference in the river basin from the criterion suggested by nilsson et al 2005 the yellow river belongs to strongly affected river since the dam storage capacity 56 3 km3 and water consume 36 6 km3 in the river basin have approached the mean annual discharge during 1950s level 48 km3 to the sea peng et al 2010 indicated the relative contributions of human interference in the river basin and precipitation change to the multistep decline of sediment load at huayuankou based on the initial stage in 1950s sediment retention by dams together with soil conservation practice were responsible for 107 and 58 in sediment loss during 1960 1985 and 1986 1999 peng et al 2010 the conservative estimates shows the sediment retention by soil conservation practice in the middle reach reaching 4 35 108 t yr since 1996 gao et al 2016 in addition sanmenxia together with xiaolangdi reservoir accounted for 2 51 108 t yr sediment retention during 2000 2016 bcrs 2000 2016 sand extraction in the lower reach for 0 2 108 t yr for average byrs 2006 2015 thereafter the direct human impacts have contributed to over 48 sediment loss from river catchment to river delta in total during 2000 2016 other basin scale human impacts and climate change include water consumption reservoir storage dynamics precipitation and evaporation variation either of which will largely influence the water yield and in turn contributes to the sediment load change wang et al 2015 under this highly human disturbed river system it is convinced to believe the ayrm would be entering into an erosion stage based on 1 more dams reservoirs would be built in the yellow river catchment 2 high level and relatively stable water soil conservation practice 3 a prediction of 74 122 mm sea level rise along the yellow river coast in the next 30 years bcsl 2010 oil industry and aquaculture facilities in delta would accelerate this process higgins et al 2013 except for the estuaries of abandoned yellow river delta lobe experiencing severe erosion as a result of the sediment absence the ayrm is believed to be eroded under the new regime of terrestrial input in the next few years due to sediment starvation 5 1 2 implementation of water sediment regulation scheme the wsrs induced coarser sediment with low ssc delivery has distinct impact on sediment dispersal and deposition pattern dong 1997 indicated 50 of sediment delivery contributed to the river mouth rebuilt from 1964 to 1982 in comparison our study finds a larger proportion with 68 of total sediment input deposition near the river mouth since river delivered by qing 8 mouth channel the reasons are multiple obviously wsrs induced floodwater effectively scour the riverbed of deltaic channel and change the heavy deposition trend which impels suspended sediment to transport to the coastal region in addition due to the low ssc the buoyant hypopycnal plume replaced the hyperpcnal flow which was frequently recognized in flood seasons near the yellow river mouth during 1980s and 1990s the river plume during flood season has a limited extent compared to pre 1999 periods wiseman et al 1986 wright et al 1986 1988 1990 wang et al 2010a furthermore sediment settling velocity w increases in square multiple with the sediment grain size d increases according to stokes formula as a consequence operation of wsrs changed the transport and deposition of silt behavior coarser sediment delivered to the coastal oceans tended to deposit near the river mouth shallower than 10 m depth contour bi et al 2014 wu et al 2017 which is evidenced by our study table 3 although floodwater is released from co operation of upstream reservoirs in 20 days the event scale wsrs plays a dominant role in reshaping evolutionary trends at longer timescale within annual scale the protruding retreating of active river mouth is the combined influence of short term rapid seaward advance during wsrs and long term retreat by coastal dynamics wsrs is short term hydrological regulation processes but providing sufficient sediment from the lower reach and reservoirs absence of wsrs can even cause erosion in active river mouth as a majority of ayrm experienced the erosion with the first interruption of wsrs during 2015 2016 because the water discharge in the river catchment was extremely low 5 1 3 migration pathway of mouth channel in general erosion and propagation rate of deltaic land is closely related to the switching depo centers of rivers debouching to the sea fagherazzi et al 2015 which is coincident with pathway changing of mouth channel either naturally or through anthropogenic activities the latest artificial channel diversion implemented in 1996 when channel migrated at qing 8 section causing subsequent evolution of sedimentation system wu et al 2017 discovered the abandoned qingshuigou sub delta experienced significant shrink since the artificial diverted at qing 8 section as the absence of sediment supply consequently the depo center moved to the coastal zone near the active river mouth jiang et al 2017 this erosion deposition pattern indicates that the variation of spatial plan position in depo center is strictly corresponded to the input mouth channel shifts a particular interesting phenomenon appeared in 2007 again when river mouth channel migrated from eastward to northeastward during the flood season forming a new born active river mouth fig 7 shows the switching of erosion and depo center is highly corresponding to the channel migration in 2007 the depo center moved to the vicinity of new river mouth and erosion center appeared to the old whose sedimentary system was eroded under the transport of tide and wave induced currents in the following years unlike other bifurcation channels of large river deltas for instance yangtze and mississippi whose sediment discharge partition in bifurcations largely influences depo center locations the active yellow river delta forms its subaqueous deltaic system with no other than single main active mouth channel during a period therefore the pathways migration of mouth channel has direct impact on sediment transport pathways and subaqueous erosion deposition patterns although geomorphic variation of the whole active river mouth is largely influenced by the amount of sediment delivery the shifts of local erosion deposition trend influence the interactions between river flow and tidal dynamics from the point of morphodynamics causing further migration in qingbacha mouth channel and shoreline changes under the environment of less flooding events low river discharge and the protection of superelevated channel levees the yellow river deltaic channel is relatively stable except for human guiding avulsions since 1930s ganti et al 2014 most recently competitive to the active mouth channel qingbacha beicha has been considered as one of the potential mouth channel for the sustainability consideration of gudong oilfield whose littoral zone has been seriously eroded in the past years fig 1b if beicha becomes the pathway of mouth channel the subaqueous sedimentation system is going to trigger a bigger transformation since the low river delivery and harmonious relationship between water and sediment the deltaic mouth channel would be relatively stable hence migration of channel perhaps would induce more direct evolution of subaqueous system compared to sediment supply at decadal or longer timescale 5 2 qualification of critical sediment discharge and implications for delta sustainability traditionally deltaic morphological evolution is determined by relative strength of riverine input and coastal dynamics of all the influential factors sediment delivery is the primary source and driving factor for the shaping of sedimentation system and delta morphology liu et al 2014b kong et al 2015b critical sediment delivery is the minimum requirement for erosion accretion equilibrium which has been calculated by a number of case studies through variation of subaerial area and long term volume variability in subaqueous delta wang et al 2006b cui and li 2011 bi et al 2014 jiang et al 2017 fan et al 2018b however few studies have concentrated on the critical sediment discharge of maintaining the ayrm based on sediment supply to the sea and accurate survey of underwater topography in ayrm we build a linear regression model between volume change in active subaqueous delta δv and suspended sediment discharge qs 5 δ v 0 0 848 q s 0 528 r 2 0 714 p 0 008 trend 1 however the correlation coefficient is not satisfying owing to the initial protruding of the river mouth before 2001 blue dash circle in fig 8 which is rapidly accretion in the initial deposition environment and sensitive to the abrupt decline in sediment discharge in 1999 2000 and 2001 to avoid the error in fast growing deltaic system and severe erosion drought years in initial stage we take the 1996 2001 time series as a whole time series as 6 δ v 1 0 606 q s 0 251 r 2 0 900 p 0 001 trend 2 when δ v 0 0 a threshold value of qs0 62 3 mt yr and qs1 41 4 mt yr respectively can achieve the qing8 active subaqueous delta maintenance the convincible result 41 4 mt yr 62 3 mt yr is highly closed to the estimation through land area change from bi et al 2014 50 mt yr as for the sediment load passing lijin station in 2016 is only 10 6 mt much lower than the critical sediment load calculated here and severe coastal erosion occurred in ayrm it is clear that the new riverine regime of yellow river is dam controlled which is effective in reducing flood risk and managing water resources it is similar to other major rivers worldwide who have also witnessed the fluvial regime transforming from the natural to the highly human regulated however sediment delivery has declined 98 in nile 69 in mississippi 66 in yangtze and 99 in yellow river from their natural modes becoming the constraint for delta sustainability giosan et al 2014 our study shows not only the amount of sediment input but water regulation program and mouth channel migration are important factors that dominating the erosion accretion trends of active river mouth in different timescales from the perspective of these factors the integrated regulation strategies should consider the environmental implications both for the yellow river lower reach and delta building wsrs has acted as a basin scale water regulation program in mitigating infilling sediment in dams flushing the lower reach and deltaic channel providing substantial amount of sediment to the coastal ocean simultaneously to meet the minimum sediment demands for sustaining ayrm the water consumption and water discharge should be re balanced on the basin scale aiming that more floodwater can be released by the integrated control of upstream dams in this way can the floodwater increase the sediment flushing amount and compensate the decrease of scouring efficiency in the lower reach from the perspective of channel migration the potential deltaic channel can be considered as sediment transport pathways for erosive coastal protection like gdlz but future studies among scenario simulations between sediment flow and coastal dynamics should be carefully conducted before man made avulsion projects 5 3 error analysis the error from kriging interpolation technique utilized in this study is largely reduced if numerous topographic points are available yang et al 2011a the bathymetric data was from highly quality controlled bathymetric surveys hence is relatively accurate the bathymetric contours are smooth and the interpolation result is convincible it should be noticed that when calculating the sink direction of terrestrial sediment load the volume change of subaerial land is underestimated the elevation of new built land is considered equal to the elevation of waterline 0 m if the error of the elevation range of new born deltaic land is assumed to be 1 m this will result in an error of the deviation of land building of 0 51 108 m3 during 1996 2016 constituted approximately 2 89 of total sediment discharging to the sea during that period which can be regarded as acceptable we also ignored the influence of sea level rise to the volumetric change when comparing the tidal range and bathymetric change since the sea level rise along yellow river deltaic coast in the past two decades was only within 10 cm 6 conclusions 1 yellow river discharge regime can be divided into three periods 1950 1985 1986 1999 and 2000 2016 based on the abrupt change in river input reduction 1985 and construction of xiaolangdi reservoir 1999 water delivery was followed a dramatic decline in 1986 and remained a stable level since then but sediment input was found successive declining in the three periods the latest regime of riverine delivery featured the implementation of wsrs which further altered the relationship between water and sediment discharge into the harmonious both in the lower reach of the yellow river and to the sea 2 the different segment in active yrsd present transverse evolution trends accretion occurred in ayrm and erosion in gdlz the active river mouth since 1996 experienced four varied stages namely moderate accretion 1996 2002 rapid accretion 2002 2007 reduced accretion 2007 2015 and rapid erosion 2015 2016 which is closely related to sediment input variability at inter annual scale in contrast gdlz is convinced to experience severe erosion due to the absence of sediment supply and intensive sediment resuspension process driven by winter wind waves 3 the new regime of riverine delivery acts multiple timescales in shaping deltaic morphology the inter annual variability of river input has strong influence on the morphological change of ayrm the man altered water regulation program had critical impact on sediment source to sink transport and accumulation at event scale by low ssc and coarser sediment derived from the lower reach riverbed during wsrs sediment accumulation is restricted within limited spatial range shallower than 10 m isobaths and 68 sediment delivery deposited near the active river mouth with an average vertical accretion of 0 15 m yr at decadal timescale the pathway migration of mouth channels has directly impacted on subaqueous erosion deposition patterns exceeding the effect of sediment delivery to the deltaic system to some extent 4 the interruption of 14 yr successive operation of wsrs in 2016 transformed the active river mouth from accretion to erosion for the first time from the perspective of deltaic system at least 41 4 62 3 mt yr of the sediment input is required to achieve the erosion accretion balance of active river mouth it is expected the overall yellow river subaqueous deltaic system would remain the erosion state as a result of intensified human impacts in the river basin additionally our study reveals that basin scale water regulation and channel migration projects can help sustain regional deltaic morphology

7071,the yellow river subaqueous delta yrsd once the most rapid depo center among river deltas worldwide has been under the risks of subsidence and degradation due to the new regime of riverine delivery affected by human interventions utilizing hydrologic and bathymetric surveying datasets we examined the latest regime of river input from the perspective of water sediment relationship and the responding morphological evolutionary processes of active yrsd over a period of 20 years between 1996 and 2016 results show that the new discharge regime is strongly interfered by the water sediment regulation scheme wsrs characterized by a more drastic decline of sediment load than that of water discharge more harmonious relationship between water and sediment discharges in the lower reach of the river to the sea coarser sediment delivery and low suspended sediment concentration ssc we identified inverse erosion accretion trends in the subaqueous region net accretion of 0 15 m yr in the active yellow river mouth ayrm and severe erosion of 0 1 m yr in the gudong littoral zone gdlz as the primary sink for sediment delivery ayrm received approximately 68 of sediment delivery during the study period and sedimentation was mainly occurred in the shallower area where water depth was less than 10 m in addition recent morphological evolution of ayrm is found to have undergone through four stages namely moderate accretion 1996 2002 rapid accretion 2002 2007 reduced accretion 2007 2015 and rapid erosion 2015 2016 the new regime of riverine delivery presents multiple spatiotemporal scales in shaping deltaic morphology compared with the previous research we present the morphological evolution of deltaic system over decadal timescale is strongly influenced by reduction of sediment supply derived from basin scale human impacts and the variability of subaqueous portion during the study period is closely related to inter annual variability of river input besides the building of ayrm is shaped by event scale wsrs induced floodwater and decade scale change of sediment pathway governed by frequent mouth channel migration the results show for the first time that ayrm has experienced a significant erosion since the implementation of wsrs with a decline of 99 sediment delivery in 2016 compared to the natural mode during 1950s the results also indicate that to maintain the erosion accretion balance of ayrm an estimation of 41 4 62 3 mt yr sediment delivery should be kept due to the fluvial regime change from the natural to the highly human regulated modes the ayrm as well as the whole yrsd is expected to be transforming from the accretion to erosion states keywords active yellow river mouth new regime of wsrs morphological variability accretion and erosion human interference 1 introduction due to naturalflat terrain fertile soils and abundant water resources over half a billion people densely inhabited in river deltas during the anthropocene syvitski et al 2009 kuenzer et al 2014 with rapid population and economic growth over the last century anthropogenic interventions drastically intensified in river basins upstream damming flow diversion and intensified water consumption in river catchment dominated the reduction of river input in recent decades sanchez arcilla et al 1998 carriquiry and sánchez 1999 vörösmarty et al 2003 walling 2006 as a result river deltas today are facing increasing challenges in stabilizing deltaic morphology and shoreline as there have been severe coastal land loss in mississippi delta and nile delta stanley 1996 blum and roberts 2009 large scale shoreline retreat in mekong delta anthony et al 2015 recession and land subsidence in yangtze delta yang et al 2011a and transformation from accretion to erosion in pearl river delta dai et al 2008 wu et al 2016 therefore scientists and engineers have considerably expanded monitoring and impact studies on sustainability of river deltas giosan et al 2014 which has made the latest regime of river input and responded geomorphic and environmental implications in worldwide river deltas a hotspot in hydrologic and coastal research similar to other megadeltas morphologic evolution of yellow river huanghe delta is significantly impacted by human activities intensified human intervention in the river catchment induced sharp decline in river input in recent years wang et al 2006a 2007 syvitski and saito 2007 miao et al 2011 liu et al 2012 in addition there are extensive engineering activities influencing the development of delta such as human avulsion engineering projects for oilfield protection dikes and levees for flood control groynes and breakwaters for storm surge defense and coastal protection bi et al 2014 zheng et al 2018 other economic activities including oil exploiting land reclamation and aquaculture are rapidly developing which also have profound impacts for ecosystem vulnerability and landscape change yue et al 2003 zhang et al 2017 chi et al 2018 fan et al 2018a thus it is urgent for investigations to be carried out to maintain the delta sustainability by keeping the right balance between human intervention and natural forcing on the other hand yellow river delta is distinctive from other megadeltas with its developing pattern the delta has been formed as a fan shaped landscape with frequent deltaic channel avulsions since 1855 until 2016 there have been 11 major channel avulsions and frequent channel bifurcations zheng et al 2018 thereafter the yellow river delta has high spatial variations in evolutionary processes rapid accretion occurring in active yellow river mouth ayrm with sufficient sediment supply and erosion in abandoned river mouth due to sediment starvation li et al 2000 chu et al 2006 cui and li 2011 xing et al 2016 multi year estimation indicates that the sediment delivered to the delta annually is in the range of 1 08 billion tons milliman and meade 1983 which makes it one of the most rapid deposition center in the world zhou et al 2015 however associated with the reduction of river input in recent decades the aggradation rates of ayrm has slowed down especially after 1996 when the channel artificial diversion at qing 8 section cui and li 2011 jiang et al 2017 wu et al 2017 in addition the implementation of water sediment regulation scheme wsrs since 2002 has transformed the river discharge to a highly human altered regime the natural seasonal variability of river discharge being overridden by the prior designed short term substantial river discharge delivery fourteen years after the operation of this basin scale water regulation program it is perhaps the time to re estimate the new regime of human activity derived riverine delivery and consequent changes in coastal environment in yellow river delta numerous studies have been conducted in the primary role of wsrs in promoting the spread of nutrients wang et al 2017b reshaping shoreline dynamics cui and li 2011 kong et al 2015a fan et al 2018b changing land areas in subaerial delta xu 2008 bi et al 2014 jiang et al 2017 wu et al 2017 and dominating evolution processes of active yellow river subaqueous delta yrsd specifically bi et al 2014 found the profile slope of subaqueous delta increasing as delta advancing seaward near the active river mouth wu et al 2017 considered the grain size of sediment delivery and reduction of river input as dominated factors driving morphological evolution in yrsd since the operation of wsrs however under recent man derived fluvial regime little is known about morphological adaption in the deposition area of wsrs delivered sediment suggested by wang et al 2017a in addition the spatial variability of active yrsd have been frequently ignored due to the lack of high resolution geometric survey data as the key element of land ocean interaction processes the active yrsd behavior to the altered fluvial regime needs further appreciation and evaluation thus in this study the variation of ayrm under the new regime of river input is examined based on high resolution bathymetric survey data in active yrsd from 1996 to 2016 and temporal changes in water and sediment delivery we first define the new regime of terrestrial delivery by comparing it with the previous river input from the point of statistical analysis then we analyze the different erosion accretion patterns in active yrsd including ayrm and gudong littoral zone gdlz and quantify finally we discuss the dominant factors of new discharge regime impacts on the deltaic behavior and provide recommendations for the yellow river management from the perspective of deltaic sedimentation system based on the better understanding of the recent morphologic variability corresponding to the human altered discharge regime gained from this study 2 regional setting the yellow river originates from qinghai tibet plateau and runs through loess plateau and north china plain successively finally emptying into the bohai sea exceeding its length with 5464 km and a river catchment of 7 52 105 km2 fig 1 a the upper reach of the yellow river is the main water source providing more than 90 of total water discharge but small amount of sediment because of the intensive erosion in loess plateau the middle reach becomes the primary source of suspended sediment dominating over 90 of total sediment load in the river drainage miao et al 2011 the lower reach channel is the sink of sediment from upstream especially coarse sediment for the gentle terrain and few tributaries in addition the riverbed of the lower reach is higher than the elevation of riverside and considered as hanging river there have been many flooding disasters in the lower reach drainage historically when peak flows bursting the riverbank during the flood season causing severe losses in the alluvial plain of the lower yellow river the modern yellow river delta has begun to build out rapidly since the yellow river breached at tongwaxiang and shifted from jiangsu province to the daqinghe river course entering into the bohai sea through shandong province chu et al 2006 deltaic channel shifted frequently at the apex of ninghai before 1953 and then it moved downstream to yuwa li et al 2001 peng et al 2010 since then the deltaic channel followed by shenxiangou channel 1953 1964 diaokouhe channel 1964 1976 qingshuigou channel 1976 present then artificially shifted at the qing 8 section in august 1996 as the present qingbacha mouth channel fig 1b due to the concerns of the stability of qingshuigou channel and decrease in the potential risk of flooding syvitski and saito 2007 peng et al 2010 we divide the active yrsd into sub regions of ayrm and gdlz according to different fluvial and marine dynamics and erosion accretion trends fig 1b the evolution process of ayrm is determined by collective long term erosion and short term rapid accretion during flood season within a year particularly after the implementation of wsrs during wsrs on average 20 days each year high concentration suspended sediment rapidly deposited within 10 m water depth in the river mouth due to the barrier effect of the tidal shear front on the river laden sediment dispersion bi et al 2010 wu et al 2015 while in other days especially in winter sediment resuspended mostly by storm waves and transported to offshore sea yang et al 2011b gudong oilfield is located in the northwest of ayrm fig 1b producing 30 million tons of oil per year ren and walker 1998 17 2 km long seawalls were constructed as relatively stable artificial coastline between 1985 and 1987 to protect the oilfield however there is huge spending every year to sustain the coastal protection near gudong but the deepest water depth near the seawall has exceeded 4 7 m by in situ observation in 2016 fig 1c the yrsd is dominated by irregular semi diurnal tide with mean tidal range of 0 6 0 8 m near the river mouth li et al 1998 tidal current is parallel to the coast which flows southward during flood tide and northward during ebb tide with the current speed of 1 0 2 0 m s wang et al 2010a the residual current averages 0 2 0 3 m s in surface layers driven by monsoon winds and fluvial discharge zhang et al 1990 waves off the river mouth is generally driven by southerly winds in summer and northeasterly winds in winter with an average wave height up to 1 5 m enhancing the resuspension of sediments in the littoral area of yellow river delta especially in shenxiangou old estuary and gudong nearshore chu et al 2006 sandy silt accounts for the largest proportion in seabed surface sediment type according to the classification of folk ren et al 2011 3 materials and methods 3 1 data

with the elevation datum of subaqueous measurements combining the deltaic shoreline and field observation data we use kriging technique in arcgis 10 3 to interpolate the subaqueous deltaic topography

sea mann kendall mk test of annual variation trend indicates a significant decline in water discharge and sediment load delivered to the sea during 1950 2016 as recorded at lijin station the most seaward hydrological station 109 km from the active river mouth fig 2 a and table 2 in addition the decline in sediment delivery has been greater than water discharge due to the z value of the mk trend test in 6 55 and 7 30 respectively with the kendall slope of 6 53 108 m3 yr and 0 21 108 t yr pettitt test shows temporal abrupt change point occurred in 1985 of both time series in water and sediment discharge which indicates a different time series median occurring since 1986 compared to pre 1985 period fig 2b and c the average water discharge and sediment load shifted downward after the abrupt change point more than 63 and 76 this change point was probably associated with effective soil conservation practice in the middle reach and the closure of longyangxia reservoir 1986 wang et al 2007 xiaolangdi reservoir the most critical engineering project of yellow river during 2000s began to operate in 1999 correspondingly sediment delivery went on a decreasing trend with an average value of 1 20 108 t yr as a result of sediment retention behind dams whereas the average water discharging to the sea during 1986 1999 and 2000 2016 remained a relatively stable level with 150 155 108 m3 yr by basin scale flow regulation fig 2d the severe sediment starvation occurred in 2016 with the lowest level ever recorded at lijin with only 10 6 mt the insufficient sediment delivery was less than 1 of 1950s level which represents the natural fluvial mode despite the stepwise decline in river input influenced by human impacts the relationship between water and sediment discharge has greatly changed here we use the average annual incoming sediment coefficient ξa which reflects the relationship between incoming suspended sediment concentration cs and water amount qw 4 ξ a c s q w q s q w 2 between 1950 and 1985 the average incoming sediment coefficients at huayuankou and lijin were 0 021 and 0 024 respectively which markedly increased to 0 030 and 0 066 after the closure of liujiaxia reservoir fig 3 a it reflected the inconsistent relationship between water and sediment delivered to the lower reach and inevitably caused the decrease of sediment transport capacity and consequent heavy siltation in the lower reach riverbed in addition due to the drastic decline in water and sediment input no flow days appeared more frequently after 1986 in 1997 the length of riverbed drying up reached its peak level of 706 km and 226 no flow days peng et al 2010 to mitigate the excessive deposition state in the elevated riverbed in the lower reach the water sediment regulation scheme wsrs based at xiaolangdi reservoir was designed to regulate river discharge and began its operation in 2002 wang et al 2010b yu et al 2013 the released flood water over a limited 20 day period effectively scoured the riverbed of the lower reach and deeply improved the environment of lower reach especially after 2005 the ξa at huayuankou and lijin both decreased lower than 0 014 the critical value for erosion deposition trend in the lower reach suggested by hu 2005 indicating the siltation in the lower reach has transformed directly to the net erosion state on the other hand linear regression relationship between water and sediment discharge shares similar trend between 1950 and 1985 and 1986 1999 after the closure of xiaolangdi reservoir the gradient of trend line after 1999 is significantly lower than the pre 1999 level representing the relationship between water and sediment has completely changed into the harmonious with drastic decline in annual suspended sediment concentration the fourteen years successive operation of wsrs had profound impacts on hydrological processes and source to sink cycles from the lower reach to the river mouth the man made flood peaks during wsrs has distinctively changed the distribution of river input through a year by delivering about 30 annual water discharge and 50 annual sediment load in limited 20 days in addition the flow regulation successfully mitigated the excessive deposition state in the xiaolangdi reservoir and the elevated riverbed of yellow river lower reach which made the riverbed downstream the xiaolangdi becoming a new primary sediment source correspondingly the median grain size of input increased to 25 8 μm in the early stage of the operation of the wsrs 2002 2007 however the efficiency of lower reach scouring was slowed down since 2008 because most fine particles on the riverbed had been eroded and transported to the river mouth in the early years the average median grain size decreased to 20 1 μm in the late stage of wsrs 2008 2015 fig 4 a fig 4b shows a drastic decline in ssc peak value and significant seasonal migration since the completion of xiaolangdi reservoir the average ssc in flood season july october reached 31 6 kg m3 in pre 1999 and migrated to its peak value with 9 1 kg m3 during june july when the wsrs frequently operated 4 2 erosion deposition patterns in the active yellow river mouth to quantify the accurate morphological changes in ayrm bathymetric survey data combined with dem establishing is important thus eight subaqueous data sets from field observation which were conducted in different years during 1996 2016 are transformed into the same projected coordinates utm 50n with wgs84 datum based on the difference of dem model in adjacent years the erosion accretion area and volume are calculated separately which indicates the erosion accretion pattern in ayrm fig 5 and table 3 according to the volume change rates and evolution processes four major stages are generally divided by the initial implementation of wsrs 2002 mouth channel migration 2007 and the first interruption of wsrs 2016 in the initial years of qing 8 river mouth protruding prior to 2002 the subaqueous portion showed moderate accretion trend with 0 61 108 m3 yr and significant variance in evolution processes we observed rapid deposition appearing with the depo center located right in front of the river mouth during 1996 1998 severe erosion in 1998 2001 and accretion during 2001 2002 fig 5a b and c the unexpected sedimentation percentage in 1996 1998 was 153 presumably by the sufficient sediment source coming from southern old river mouth and the mouth channel riverbed as a result of the headward erosion additionally the receiving basin of underwater topography provided an ideal place for sedimentation because of the initial steep profile by contrast the sediment supply decreased in 1998 2001 due to the integrated effect from low precipitation and dam impoundment of the xiaolangdi reservoir the ayrm experienced an average erosion rate of 0 13 m yr particularly for the mouth bar area where erosion center is located table 3 at the beginning of the implementation of wsrs the considerable increase of sediment input induced rapid deposition during 2002 2007 with a rapid accretion trend at 0 93 108 m3 yr approximately 61 73 of total sediment delivery deposited in ayrm during this stage and most of them were found within 10 m water depth contour fig 5d and e as the river mouth shifted eastward during 2004 2007 the erosion center and depo center appeared simultaneously we observed the erosion center being around the left side of the sand spit near the river mouth where the water depth was shallower than 2 m with an average erosion rate of 2 91 m yr depo center shifted to the location just seaward of the entrance bar at around 10 m depth contour with an average vertical accretion rate of 3 14 m yr sediment deposited in the mouth bar area before 2004 can be more easily suspended by winter waves and transported by shore parallel currents because of the sediment transport pathways changing with the shift of river mouth at regional scale during the flood season in 2007 the yellow river mouth naturally shifted from eastward to northeastward leaving previous river mouth abandoned due to the lack of sediment supply during 2007 2011 depo and erosion centers interchanged the location with an average vertical rate of 1 53 m yr in abandoned erosion center and 1 49 m yr in depo center fig 5f this variation trend went on during 2011 2015 with a vertical erosion of erosion center 3 7 m and vertical accretion of depo center over 10 0 m fig 5g since the amount of sediment input decreased in 2007 2015 the deposition rate at this stage decreased to 0 57 108 m3 yr the 14 yr successive wsrs operation was first interrupted in 2016 because of the shortage of water discharge in the yellow river basin meanwhile the yellow river sediment load reached the lowest level of 10 6 mt in 2016 consequently approximately 65 of ayrm experienced erosion during 2015 2016 fig 5h net erosion volume reached 0 62 108 m3 and average vertical erosion rate in the study area exceeded 0 15 m table 3 it was the first time that ayrm experienced severe erosion since the implementation of wsrs overall the ayrm poses considerably varied trends as a result of inter annual variability in sediment input it is estimated that approximately 68 of overall sediment delivery contributed to subaerial building and subaqueous delta accretion in ayrm with net accretion rate 0 59 108 m3 yr and an average vertical accretion of 0 15 m yr fig 5i by comparing 20 yr net volume change rate of ayrm we find the evolution of ayrm experienced four stages i e moderate accretion 1996 2002 with 0 61 108 m3 yr rapid accretion 2002 2007 with 0 93 108 m3 yr reduced accretion 2007 2015 with 0 57 108 m3 yr and rapid erosion 2015 2016 with 0 53 108 m3 yr fig 5j 4 3 morphological change in gudong littoral zone the yellow river delta is home to the local shengli oilfield the second largest oilfield in china fig 6 a with sufficient supply of sediment in 1970s the coastline at gudong propagated seaward more than 5 km from 1976 to 1986 however since 1987 the coastline was subject to erosion due to the reduction of sediment supply an artificial coastal dike was first built to slow down the coastal erosion in 1987 three groins were successively built along gudong dike in 2000s fig 6b and c despite of the coastal defenses being built the overall gudong area continued to be in the state of erosion fig 6d during 1996 2016 more than 94 of gdlz suffered from erosion with an average erosion rate of 0 1 m yr table 3 the inter annual differences in erosion volume are believed to be determined by sediment delivery and the migration of river mouth as the volume for coastal erosion has decreased after the natural migration of river mouth in 2007 erosion rate increased during 2015 2016 in comparison with that in 2007 2015 since there was a significant reduction of the sediment delivery bi et al 2014 suggested a majority of suspended sediment from yellow river mouth were trapped by the groins where sediment transport pathway was intensively inhibited in addition waves driven by northeastward winter wind strengthened the sediment resuspension in gdlz which made gdlz becoming an intensive erosion region as the re suspended sediment might be transported through parallel tidal current to ayrm or offshore bathymetric cross shore transect in gdlz from 1976 to 2016 was also examined in this study to determine the temporal variation in subaqueous delta the slope of delta front shallower than 5 m water depth in gdlz shows gentle variation between 1976 and 1996 and falling from 0 64 to 0 39 during 1996 2016 fig 6e it should be noticed that the maximum erosion was distributed around the 2 m contour near gudong dike where vertical erosion exceeded 5 m fig 5i by contrast areas deeper than 5 m depth showed general accretion trend owing to the successive propagation of the active subaerial delta the transect selected was crossing the mouth bar area with water depth less than 1 m fig 6e black line 5 discussion 5 1 factors controlling the deltaic variability under the new fluvial regime 5 1 1 human activity induced decline in river discharge the delta morphologic processes are mainly dominated by terrestrial input tides wind waves storm surges and sea level conditions blum and roberts 2009 lamb et al 2012 hoitink et al 2017 adequate sediment input has direct and crucial impact on the building processes of fluvial dominated deltaic system with relative weak tidal forcing and wave actions previous studies have revealed the inter decadal variability of sediment accumulation rates in qingshuigou abandoned river mouth was 5 77 108 m3 yr during 1976 1985 3 80 108 m3 yr during 1986 1995 jiang et al 2017 and further decreased to 0 61 108 m3 yr since the river delivered by qingbacha mouth channel in 1996 similarly the deposition zone over 6 m in vertical accretion during 1996 2016 has drastically shrank to 44 3 km2 in contrast to an area of 183 06 km2 in qingshuigou old river mouth jiang et al 2017 moreover from 1996 to 2016 ayrm deposit rate in four stages had strong correlation with the inter annual variability of river input the ayrm generally remained accretion under the condition of river input in the first three stages while showing erosion in 2016 with the absence of sediment supply the littoral zone around 10 m contour relative to adjacent year is the most sensitive zone of accretion as the barrier effect of tidal shear front which is the convergence of sedimentation numerical models show the river input largely influence the front intensity but has little influence to front locations qiao et al 2008 which makes this convergence sedimentation center rather invariant in water depth reduction in sediment supply from yellow river to the sea is closely associated with human interference in the river basin from the criterion suggested by nilsson et al 2005 the yellow river belongs to strongly affected river since the dam storage capacity 56 3 km3 and water consume 36 6 km3 in the river basin have approached the mean annual discharge during 1950s level 48 km3 to the sea peng et al 2010 indicated the relative contributions of human interference in the river basin and precipitation change to the multistep decline of sediment load at huayuankou based on the initial stage in 1950s sediment retention by dams together with soil conservation practice were responsible for 107 and 58 in sediment loss during 1960 1985 and 1986 1999 peng et al 2010 the conservative estimates shows the sediment retention by soil conservation practice in the middle reach reaching 4 35 108 t yr since 1996 gao et al 2016 in addition sanmenxia together with xiaolangdi reservoir accounted for 2 51 108 t yr sediment retention during 2000 2016 bcrs 2000 2016 sand extraction in the lower reach for 0 2 108 t yr for average byrs 2006 2015 thereafter the direct human impacts have contributed to over 48 sediment loss from river catchment to river delta in total during 2000 2016 other basin scale human impacts and climate change include water consumption reservoir storage dynamics precipitation and evaporation variation either of which will largely influence the water yield and in turn contributes to the sediment load change wang et al 2015 under this highly human disturbed river system it is convinced to believe the ayrm would be entering into an erosion stage based on 1 more dams reservoirs would be built in the yellow river catchment 2 high level and relatively stable water soil conservation practice 3 a prediction of 74 122 mm sea level rise along the yellow river coast in the next 30 years bcsl 2010 oil industry and aquaculture facilities in delta would accelerate this process higgins et al 2013 except for the estuaries of abandoned yellow river delta lobe experiencing severe erosion as a result of the sediment absence the ayrm is believed to be eroded under the new regime of terrestrial input in the next few years due to sediment starvation 5 1 2 implementation of water sediment regulation scheme the wsrs induced coarser sediment with low ssc delivery has distinct impact on sediment dispersal and deposition pattern dong 1997 indicated 50 of sediment delivery contributed to the river mouth rebuilt from 1964 to 1982 in comparison our study finds a larger proportion with 68 of total sediment input deposition near the river mouth since river delivered by qing 8 mouth channel the reasons are multiple obviously wsrs induced floodwater effectively scour the riverbed of deltaic channel and change the heavy deposition trend which impels suspended sediment to transport to the coastal region in addition due to the low ssc the buoyant hypopycnal plume replaced the hyperpcnal flow which was frequently recognized in flood seasons near the yellow river mouth during 1980s and 1990s the river plume during flood season has a limited extent compared to pre 1999 periods wiseman et al 1986 wright et al 1986 1988 1990 wang et al 2010a furthermore sediment settling velocity w increases in square multiple with the sediment grain size d increases according to stokes formula as a consequence operation of wsrs changed the transport and deposition of silt behavior coarser sediment delivered to the coastal oceans tended to deposit near the river mouth shallower than 10 m depth contour bi et al 2014 wu et al 2017 which is evidenced by our study table 3 although floodwater is released from co operation of upstream reservoirs in 20 days the event scale wsrs plays a dominant role in reshaping evolutionary trends at longer timescale within annual scale the protruding retreating of active river mouth is the combined influence of short term rapid seaward advance during wsrs and long term retreat by coastal dynamics wsrs is short term hydrological regulation processes but providing sufficient sediment from the lower reach and reservoirs absence of wsrs can even cause erosion in active river mouth as a majority of ayrm experienced the erosion with the first interruption of wsrs during 2015 2016 because the water discharge in the river catchment was extremely low 5 1 3 migration pathway of mouth channel in general erosion and propagation rate of deltaic land is closely related to the switching depo centers of rivers debouching to the sea fagherazzi et al 2015 which is coincident with pathway changing of mouth channel either naturally or through anthropogenic activities the latest artificial channel diversion implemented in 1996 when channel migrated at qing 8 section causing subsequent evolution of sedimentation system wu et al 2017 discovered the abandoned qingshuigou sub delta experienced significant shrink since the artificial diverted at qing 8 section as the absence of sediment supply consequently the depo center moved to the coastal zone near the active river mouth jiang et al 2017 this erosion deposition pattern indicates that the variation of spatial plan position in depo center is strictly corresponded to the input mouth channel shifts a particular interesting phenomenon appeared in 2007 again when river mouth channel migrated from eastward to northeastward during the flood season forming a new born active river mouth fig 7 shows the switching of erosion and depo center is highly corresponding to the channel migration in 2007 the depo center moved to the vicinity of new river mouth and erosion center appeared to the old whose sedimentary system was eroded under the transport of tide and wave induced currents in the following years unlike other bifurcation channels of large river deltas for instance yangtze and mississippi whose sediment discharge partition in bifurcations largely influences depo center locations the active yellow river delta forms its subaqueous deltaic system with no other than single main active mouth channel during a period therefore the pathways migration of mouth channel has direct impact on sediment transport pathways and subaqueous erosion deposition patterns although geomorphic variation of the whole active river mouth is largely influenced by the amount of sediment delivery the shifts of local erosion deposition trend influence the interactions between river flow and tidal dynamics from the point of morphodynamics causing further migration in qingbacha mouth channel and shoreline changes under the environment of less flooding events low river discharge and the protection of superelevated channel levees the yellow river deltaic channel is relatively stable except for human guiding avulsions since 1930s ganti et al 2014 most recently competitive to the active mouth channel qingbacha beicha has been considered as one of the potential mouth channel for the sustainability consideration of gudong oilfield whose littoral zone has been seriously eroded in the past years fig 1b if beicha becomes the pathway of mouth channel the subaqueous sedimentation system is going to trigger a bigger transformation since the low river delivery and harmonious relationship between water and sediment the deltaic mouth channel would be relatively stable hence migration of channel perhaps would induce more direct evolution of subaqueous system compared to sediment supply at decadal or longer timescale 5 2 qualification of critical sediment discharge and implications for delta sustainability traditionally deltaic morphological evolution is determined by relative strength of riverine input and coastal dynamics of all the influential factors sediment delivery is the primary source and driving factor for the shaping of sedimentation system and delta morphology liu et al 2014b kong et al 2015b critical sediment delivery is the minimum requirement for erosion accretion equilibrium which has been calculated by a number of case studies through variation of subaerial area and long term volume variability in subaqueous delta wang et al 2006b cui and li 2011 bi et al 2014 jiang et al 2017 fan et al 2018b however few studies have concentrated on the critical sediment discharge of maintaining the ayrm based on sediment supply to the sea and accurate survey of underwater topography in ayrm we build a linear regression model between volume change in active subaqueous delta δv and suspended sediment discharge qs 5 δ v 0 0 848 q s 0 528 r 2 0 714 p 0 008 trend 1 however the correlation coefficient is not satisfying owing to the initial protruding of the river mouth before 2001 blue dash circle in fig 8 which is rapidly accretion in the initial deposition environment and sensitive to the abrupt decline in sediment discharge in 1999 2000 and 2001 to avoid the error in fast growing deltaic system and severe erosion drought years in initial stage we take the 1996 2001 time series as a whole time series as 6 δ v 1 0 606 q s 0 251 r 2 0 900 p 0 001 trend 2 when δ v 0 0 a threshold value of qs0 62 3 mt yr and qs1 41 4 mt yr respectively can achieve the qing8 active subaqueous delta maintenance the convincible result 41 4 mt yr 62 3 mt yr is highly closed to the estimation through land area change from bi et al 2014 50 mt yr as for the sediment load passing lijin station in 2016 is only 10 6 mt much lower than the critical sediment load calculated here and severe coastal erosion occurred in ayrm it is clear that the new riverine regime of yellow river is dam controlled which is effective in reducing flood risk and managing water resources it is similar to other major rivers worldwide who have also witnessed the fluvial regime transforming from the natural to the highly human regulated however sediment delivery has declined 98 in nile 69 in mississippi 66 in yangtze and 99 in yellow river from their natural modes becoming the constraint for delta sustainability giosan et al 2014 our study shows not only the amount of sediment input but water regulation program and mouth channel migration are important factors that dominating the erosion accretion trends of active river mouth in different timescales from the perspective of these factors the integrated regulation strategies should consider the environmental implications both for the yellow river lower reach and delta building wsrs has acted as a basin scale water regulation program in mitigating infilling sediment in dams flushing the lower reach and deltaic channel providing substantial amount of sediment to the coastal ocean simultaneously to meet the minimum sediment demands for sustaining ayrm the water consumption and water discharge should be re balanced on the basin scale aiming that more floodwater can be released by the integrated control of upstream dams in this way can the floodwater increase the sediment flushing amount and compensate the decrease of scouring efficiency in the lower reach from the perspective of channel migration the potential deltaic channel can be considered as sediment transport pathways for erosive coastal protection like gdlz but future studies among scenario simulations between sediment flow and coastal dynamics should be carefully conducted before man made avulsion projects 5 3 error analysis the error from kriging interpolation technique utilized in this study is largely reduced if numerous topographic points are available yang et al 2011a the bathymetric data was from highly quality controlled bathymetric surveys hence is relatively accurate the bathymetric contours are smooth and the interpolation result is convincible it should be noticed that when calculating the sink direction of terrestrial sediment load the volume change of subaerial land is underestimated the elevation of new built land is considered equal to the elevation of waterline 0 m if the error of the elevation range of new born deltaic land is assumed to be 1 m this will result in an error of the deviation of land building of 0 51 108 m3 during 1996 2016 constituted approximately 2 89 of total sediment discharging to the sea during that period which can be regarded as acceptable we also ignored the influence of sea level rise to the volumetric change when comparing the tidal range and bathymetric change since the sea level rise along yellow river deltaic coast in the past two decades was only within 10 cm 6 conclusions 1 yellow river discharge regime can be divided into three periods 1950 1985 1986 1999 and 2000 2016 based on the abrupt change in river input reduction 1985 and construction of xiaolangdi reservoir 1999 water delivery was followed a dramatic decline in 1986 and remained a stable level since then but sediment input was found successive declining in the three periods the latest regime of riverine delivery featured the implementation of wsrs which further altered the relationship between water and sediment discharge into the harmonious both in the lower reach of the yellow river and to the sea 2 the different segment in active yrsd present transverse evolution trends accretion occurred in ayrm and erosion in gdlz the active river mouth since 1996 experienced four varied stages namely moderate accretion 1996 2002 rapid accretion 2002 2007 reduced accretion 2007 2015 and rapid erosion 2015 2016 which is closely related to sediment input variability at inter annual scale in contrast gdlz is convinced to experience severe erosion due to the absence of sediment supply and intensive sediment resuspension process driven by winter wind waves 3 the new regime of riverine delivery acts multiple timescales in shaping deltaic morphology the inter annual variability of river input has strong influence on the morphological change of ayrm the man altered water regulation program had critical impact on sediment source to sink transport and accumulation at event scale by low ssc and coarser sediment derived from the lower reach riverbed during wsrs sediment accumulation is restricted within limited spatial range shallower than 10 m isobaths and 68 sediment delivery deposited near the active river mouth with an average vertical accretion of 0 15 m yr at decadal timescale the pathway migration of mouth channels has directly impacted on subaqueous erosion deposition patterns exceeding the effect of sediment delivery to the deltaic system to some extent 4 the interruption of 14 yr successive operation of wsrs in 2016 transformed the active river mouth from accretion to erosion for the first time from the perspective of deltaic system at least 41 4 62 3 mt yr of the sediment input is required to achieve the erosion accretion balance of active river mouth it is expected the overall yellow river subaqueous deltaic system would remain the erosion state as a result of intensified human impacts in the river basin additionally our study reveals that basin scale water regulation and channel migration projects can help sustain regional deltaic morphology

7072,the overarching goal of this study is to intercompare the newly released integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg version 05 v05 products with its former version 04 v04 and version 03 v03 products and also assess any differences and improvements with cross evaluation against the global precipitation climatology project gpcp version 2 3 multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep version 2 1 and the dense gauge networks in china firstly the gauge adjusted products final run of v03 v04 and v05 are compared over the globe then the near real time products without gauge adjustments early and late run and final run products of all versions are evaluated against ground based observations comprised of more than 30 000 gauges over mainland china at 0 1 0 1 grid and hourly and daily temporal scales the primary conclusions are 1 globally both v04 and v05 final run show significant differences and improvements from v03 particularly the overall mean oceanic precipitation of v04 and v05 increases by 31 36 and 28 81 respectively from that of v03 and much closer to gpcp and mswep 2 over mainland china the early and late run products of the same version v03 or v04 generally have similar performance while v04 early and late run have better performance in most regions than the corresponding run of v03 except in the arid xinjiang province and the mountainous tibetan plateau and 3 v04 and v03 final run show comparable performance while v05 final run generally improves upon both v04 and v03 and has the best performance among the seven standard imerg products the improvement of v05 final run is particularly evident in southeastern and western china at a timely matter the study provides first hand global and regional assessment feedback to imerg algorithm developers and also sheds insights for gpm precipitation product users across the world keywords precipitation satellite gpm imerg 1 introduction precipitation is a vital variable in the global water and energy cycle kidd and huffman 2011 and precise precipitation measurement has direct benefits on water resource management disaster prevention weather prediction and so on hou et al 2014 ma et al 2017 however precipitation measurement has always been a highly demanding yet challenging research topic for scientists typically there are three main methods to measure precipitation i e rain gauges weather radars and satellite based remote sensing yong et al 2015 satellite based remote sensing gives a complementary perspective for precipitation measurement compared with traditional ground based observations and is the only effective way to obtain comprehensive precipitation measurement at the global scale hong et al 2012 hou et al 2014 tang et al 2017 since the launch of the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm satellite by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa in 1997 a large number of scientists have developed diverse quasi global satellite based precipitation products through different techniques huffman et al 2007 joyce et al 2004 sorooshian et al 2000 hong et al 2004 kubota et al 2007 as the successor of trmm the global precipitation measurement gpm mission led by nasa and jaxa is the state of the art precipitation measurement program in the world on february 28 2014 the gpm core observatory was successfully launched the gpm constellation is composed of the core observatory and other approximately eight partner satellites the gpm core observatory carries the first spaceborne dual frequency phased array precipitation radar the dpr the ku band at 13 6 ghz and ka band at 35 5 ghz and a multichannel gpm microwave imager the gmi frequency ranging from 10 to 183 ghz the two instruments dpr and gmi are the more advanced versions compared to precipitation radar pr and trmm microwave imager tmi onboard the trmm satellite therefore the capability of detecting light rain and snow is improved and the two instruments dpr and gmi act as an intercalibration library to unify observations from diverse partner constellation radiometers tapiador et al 2012 hou et al 2014 the level 3 products of gpm produced by the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg are widely used among hydrology communities imerg products were firstly provided by nasa as version 03 v03 from march 2014 many researchers have published a series of studies to reveal characteristics of uncertainties and errors of imerg v03 products tang et al 2016a b ma et al 2016 li et al 2017 guo et al 2016 gaona et al 2016 tan et al 2016 2017 asong et al 2017 mayor et al 2017 precipitation processing system pps the organization at nasa goddard space flight center gsfc that processes and distributes precipitation records from gpm releases newer imerg version 04 v04 and version 05 v05 final run products successively on march 22 and november 20 2017 the changes from v03 to v04 and from v04 to v05 are multifactorial imerg v04 experienced several upgrades compared to the previous v03 for example imerg v04 employs the 2017 version 1 of the goddard profiling algorithm gprof2017 v1 to compute precipitation estimates from all microwave sensors which is an upgrade version compared with gprof2014 used in imerg v03 furthermore the advanced temperature and moisture sounder atms a multi channel passive microwave radiometer is added as a new source of precipitation estimates additional changes from v03 to v04 include calibrating infrared ir estimates dynamically to the imerg high quality hq data calibrating 2bcmb to gpcp v2 3 over ocean at middle and high latitudes and over land globally extending imerg hq data coverage from 60 n s to 90 n s correcting the bug that mistakenly assigned 1 3 kalman weighting to ir in certain cases and so on huffman et al 2017c on the basis of imerg v04 the latest v05 applies a more advanced version of gprof v05 to compute microwave based precipitation estimates in addition more fields and components are added into v05 products for example gprof estimates from all available microwave sensors are provided in the hqprecipitation field the quality index is also added for all half hour and monthly v05 products when combing the satellite estimates with gauge observations gauge error estimates are defined to provide feasible weights for correction meanwhile some procedures of imerg algorithms which are associated with potential issues are removed for safety for example the tmi estimates are not computed in gprof and the mhs and atms estimates are also restricted to specific footprints at each swath edge which is treated to reduce the amount of microwave based precipitation estimates to some extent huffman et al 2017e the transition from v04 to v05 only takes eight months in addition to our best knowledge currently there is no study analyzing the quality of imerg v05 products and comprehensively intercomparing imerg v03 v04 and v05 to clarify their similarities differences and improvements huffman et al 2017e conducted initial validation for imerg final run products compared to the multi radar multisensor mrms based ground observations over conterminous us wei et al 2017 evaluated imerg v03 v04 and other satellite based precipitation products with gauge observations in three climatologic zones in china and found v04 didn t show an advantage over v03 in the tibetan plateau region and the weihe river basin zhao et al 2017 investigated the successive imerg v03 and v04 final run products with a comparison of the china daily precipitation analysis products with a resolution of 0 25 0 25 over mainland china and also found that v04 didn t exhibit the anticipated improvement for china compared to v03 su et al 2018 evaluated the daily precipitation product from imerg v04 final run for monitoring three heavy rain events mainly over eastern china in 2016 and proved that the daily imerg v04 final run products can basically capture the spatiotemporal patterns of heavy rain events therefore it is urgent to address the following question which is crucial for hydrology applications how do the three versions of imerg products perform both at global and regional scales the objectives of this study are twofold 1 intercomparing imerg v03 v04 and v05 final run products over the globe at 0 1 0 1 daily resolutions 2 evaluating and comparing imerg v03 v04 and v05 early late and final run products over mainland china at 0 1 0 1 spatial resolution and multiple temporal resolutions hourly and daily against ground based observations from the china meteorological administration cma the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 mainly describes the study areas and data sets section 3 introduces the methodology i e calculation of evaluation metrics section 4 intercompares and evaluates imerg v03 v04 and v05 finally the conclusions discussions and recommended future works are introduced in section 5 2 study area and data sets 2 1 study area in global analysis the study area covers 60 n s in regional analysis the study area is mainland china fig 1 a eight sub regions are defined in fig 1 b according to chen et al 2013 and guo et al 2016 to comprehensively investigate the error characteristics of imerg products depending on topography tang et al 2006 and climatic conditions guo et al 2007 tang et al 2016a qian and lin 2005 the sub regions are 1 the xinjiang xj region in central asia which is dominated by an arid or semiarid climate with little precipitation over the whole year 2 the qinghai tibetan plateau tp dominated by the plateau mountain climate with high altitude complex topography and significant precipitation variability 3 northwestern china nw bounded by the 400 mm annual precipitation isohyet 4 northeastern china ne located in the north of the yan mountains 5 northern china nc located in the north of the qinling mountains and the huai river the climate of nw ne and nc is primarily controlled by the temperate continental climate with a hot and wet summer and a cold and dry winter 6 the plain region of changjiang yangtze river cj located in the middle lower reaches of yangtze river 7 the yungui plateau in southwestern china sw is bounded by the dabashan mountains to the north and the wulingshan mountains to the east 8 southeast china se bounded by the nanling mountains to the north and the wuyishan mountains to the northwest the climate of cj and se is primarily controlled by the subtropical or tropical monsoon from the western pacific ocean characterized by a hot and wet summer and a mild and dry winter while the major factor affecting the climate of sw is the monsoon between the tp and the indian ocean 2 2 data sets 2 2 1 satellite precipitation estimates data sets the imerg system merges all available satellite microwave precipitation estimates microwave calibrated ir estimates ground gauge analyses and potentially other estimates at 0 1 0 1 spatial and half hour temporal resolutions huffman et al 2017f g imerg provides three kinds of products including early and late run about 4 h and 12 h respectively after observation and final run about 2 months after the observation month huffman et al 2017a b early and late run products are produced in near real time and calibrated with climatological coefficients varying by month and location in contrast the final run product is produced post real time after gauge adjustments to be consistent with the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc precipitation data huffman et al 2017f g therefore the final run product is characterized by higher accuracy particularly over land while the early and late run products have better timeliness which is appealing to flood forecast and monitoring in this study the final run products of imerg v03 v03 f v04 v04 f and v05 v05 f and the early and late run products of imerg v03 v03 e and v03 l respectively and v04 v04 e and v04 l respectively are used as imerg v05 early and late run products are not available yet they are absent in the study huffman et al 2017d for the final run imerg v03 f v04 f and v05 f are intercompared from june 1 2014 to may 31 2015 because imerg v03 f stopped updating in february 2016 and a full two year overlapping dataset is not available for the early and late run imerg v03 e v03 l and v04 e v04 l are compared from june 1 2015 to may 31 2016 because imerg v03 early and late run products were available since march 2015 the raw resolutions of these products are 0 1 0 1 and half hour hourly and daily data sets used in this study are accumulated from half hourly data sets the imerg data could be downloaded from the precipitation measurement missions pmm website huffman et al 2017h https pmm nasa gov data access downloads gpm the absence of accurate and independent surface based observations across the globe makes it impossible to directly evaluate the quality of imerg products globally as an alternative strategy two other global precipitation products are used as the reference in the intercomparison one is the global precipitation climatology project gpcp version 2 3 monthly precipitation data set at 2 5 2 5 spatial resolution adler et al 2003 2017 gpcp combines various satellite precipitation products over ocean and land and a gauge analysis over land to provide a consistent estimation of global precipitation huffman et al 1997 gpcp has become a robust and widely used global precipitation product after several iterations of improvements another product is multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep version 2 1 which is a new global precipitation data set at 3 hourly temporal and 0 1 0 1 spatial resolution beck et al 2017a mswep utilizes various gauge satellite and reanalysis based data to produce an integrated precipitation estimates over the globe beck et al 2017a and it performed best among 22 precipitation datasets in a comprehensive global evaluation beck et al 2017b the potential issue for the intercomparison using other global precipitation datasets such as gpcp and mswep is that they may have some overlapping precipitation data sources as imerg products for example both gpcp and iemrg contain gpcc for bias correction and share some of input datasets e g ir and special sensor microwave imager sounder ssmis data adler et al 2018 however the three global precipitation estimates imerg gpcp and mswep are produced by different retrieval algorithms and the relative difference of imerg v03 v04 and v05 that the paper focuses on are mainly due to the update of imerg algorithms but not the input datasets moreover the employment of two benchmarks gpcp and mswep would also contribute to the confidence of the intercomparison not just over land but more importantly over ocean where there are no such anchors like gpcc for bias correction the gpcp v2 3 could be accessed from physical science division psd in noaa https www esrl noaa gov psd data gridded data gpcp html and mswep could be accessed in the website of toward locally relevant global hydrological simulations gloh2o http www gloh2o org 2 2 2 rain gauge data sets more than 30 000 gauges over mainland china are adopted to provide hourly ground based precipitation observations as independent reference from june 1 2014 to may 31 2016 shen et al 2014 all gauges are categorized into imerg 0 1 0 1 grid cells only grid cells with at least one gauge are chosen to conduct evaluation and if more than one gauge in one grid cell averaged value is employed this processing method has been widely used in many other similar works cohen liechti et al 2012 demaria et al 2011 liebmann and allured 2005 ma et al 2018 salio et al 2015 tang et al 2018a xu et al 2017 the hourly gauge observations go through several steps of quality control including 1 eliminating extreme values 2 examining internal consistency and 3 examining spatial consistency shen et al 2010 the spatial distribution of gauge density is displayed in fig 1 a the majority of gauges are located in southern and eastern china while fewer gauges are located in northern and western china note that the limited gauges especially in northern and western china could contribute to the uncertainties in the evaluation of imerg products as said before gpcc networks are used as reference to adjust imerg final run products however gpcc networks only use data from 194 china s stations which means that the gauges used in this paper more than 30 000 are mostly 99 independent of gpcc networks shen et al 2013 guaranteeing the reliability of evaluation results besides the gauge adjustments for imerg final run products are conducted at the monthly scale while the evaluation of this paper are carried out at hourly and daily scales 3 methodology to quantify the accuracy of imerg products of different versions eight statistic metrics are used in this study table 1 the pearson correlation coefficient cc describing the linear correlation level between satellite precipitation estimates and gauge observations is able to measure the capability of reproducing the temporal variations the bias ratio β describing the error and bias is able to measure the overestimation β 1 or underestimation β 1 of satellite precipitation products the variability ratio γ describes the difference of the distributions of precipitation products and gauge observations the modified kling gupta efficiency kge is an integrated statistic consisting of cc β and γ kling et al 2012 zambrano bigiarini et al 2017 another indice describing errors is the root mean square error rmse contingency table indices which include the probability of detection pod the false alarm ratio far and the critical success index csi are included to describe the consistency between estimated and observed rain event occurrence the rain no rain threshold is set to 0 1 mm for both hourly and daily scales tang et al 2016a 4 results 4 1 global intercomparison between imerg v03 v04 and v05 products 4 1 1 global view of the spatial difference the spatial distribution of global mean daily precipitation of imerg v05 f is shown in fig 2 a in addition by subtracting v03 f v04 f and v05 f precipitation rates from those of gpcp the spatial differences between the three products and gpcp are displayed in fig 2 b d respectively the resolution of v03 f v04 f v05 f and mswep is averaged to 2 5 2 5 to be consistent with gpcp over the global ocean the mean precipitation rate of v04 f and v05 f is 3 10 and 3 04 mm day which is about 30 higher than that of v03 f 2 36 mm day and much closer to that of the globally reanalyzed benchmark gpcp 2 94 mm day mswep 2 93 mm day this phenomenon could mainly be attributed to the upgraded schemes both in v04 and v05 that climatologically calibrates the gmi dpr combined level 2 product 2bcmb to gpcp v2 3 over ocean at middle and high latitudes huffman et al 2017a b 2bcmb is the calibrator for all of the passive microwave radiometers in the gpm constellation besides the upgraded gprof algorithms gprof2017 version 1 for v04 and gprof v05 for v05 are also contributed to the significant differences according to the study by behrangi et al 2014 the near global 60 n s oceanic precipitation rate for 3 yr 2007 09 by the merged precipitation estimate from the cloudsat trmm and aqua platforms mcta climate prediction center merged analysis of precipitation cmap and gpcp version 2 2 is 3 13 2 96 and 2 97 mm day respectively which could further demonstrate the consistency between oceanic precipitation estimates from v04 f v05 f and other satellite precipitation products while over the global land different products have relatively comparable mean daily precipitation rates about 2 30 mm day for v03 f v04 f v05 f and gpcp and about 2 22 mm day for mswep which is mainly due to the gauge correction composition gpcc in most precipitation products over land over ocean as shown in fig 2 b d v04 f and v05 f precipitation is much larger and closer to gpcp than v03 f s e g northeastern and mid southern pacific ocean northwestern and southwestern atlantic ocean and the equatorial zones while over land the three versions have similar spatial distributions of the differences with gpcp and the differences between v03 f and v04 f v05 f are relatively small with negative and positive differences distributing alternatively this result can be partially attributed to the rough spatial average for imerg products from 0 1 0 1 to 2 5 2 5 grids which makes slight differences invisible thus more specific evaluation at imerg s raw spatial resolution should be carried out over land e g the mainland china which is executed as below seasonal differences between imerg v03 f and v05 f are also analyzed as representation fig 3 there are notable positive differences over ocean in all seasons particularly in equatorial and high latitudes and the difference in mam is relatively small in contrast over land most regions have relatively low differences and apparent differences only occur in equatorial regions such as northern south america and central africa in addition the difference exhibits strong seasonality over some land regions e g the distinctive difference in india and southern and western china mainly occurs in jja when the monsoon is dominant in those regions the seasonality of differences can also be found in northwest pacific ocean where there are large positive adjustments in jja but negative adjustments in djf however along both sides of the equator in middle and east pacific ocean and atlantic ocean the difference remains similar in all four seasons 4 1 2 analysis on zonal mean fig 4 presents the curves of the latitudinal distribution of the annual mean precipitation for imerg v03 f v04 f v05 f gpcp and mswep over both ocean and land over ocean the profile curves of five products have similar latitudinal pattern and they are stable and smooth the rainfall peak is located at 6 5 n this is mainly due to the intertropical convergence zone itcz where a large number of precipitation events move forward north of the equator in boreal summer wu et al 2003 on the contrary the minimum rainfall amount is located near the tropics of cancer and capricorn 23 5 n s and 60 s as the prevalence of downdraft under the control of high pressure in these areas hendon et al 2014 compared with v03 f the curves of v04 f and v05 f are much closer to that of gpcp and mswep especially between 0 and 20 n and between 10 s and 20 s v04 f and v05 f show slight overestimation than benchmarks overall while v03 f has significant underestimation mostly occurring in high latitude zones and equatorial zones see fig 2 b over land it is noted that the variation of precipitation profiles is much larger and complicated than that over ocean which is mainly due to the widespread variability of continental precipitation related to topography at local scale yong et al 2015 the maximum rainfall over land is located at about 1 5 s furthermore the curves of v03 f v04 f v05 f and gpcp are quite close to each other especially between 20 n s this is mainly because of the rain gauge adjustments using the gpcc full analysis for imerg final run products over land mswep shows smaller magnitudes than other four products for most latitude ranges while relatively large values appear near the 50 s 4 2 evaluation of imerg v03 v04 and v05 in china in this section the products including imerg v03 v03 e v03 l and v03 f v04 v04 e v04 l and v04 f and v05 v05 f are evaluated in china using independent high density ground gauges the evaluation of imerg products in china is executed in two different perspectives i e national based and grid based in order to enhance the reliability of the evaluation conclusions in national based evaluation the different versions of imerg products are compared using averaged values over the whole country in grid based evaluation the different versions are compared using the exact value at each grid cell the period for the final run products is from june 2014 to may 2015 at 0 1 0 1 spatial resolution and hourly and daily temporal resolutions while the early and late run products are from june 2015 to may 2016 at 0 1 0 1 spatial resolution and hourly temporal resolution 4 2 1 national based evaluation the spatial distribution of gauge based mean daily precipitation over china is shown in fig 5 a indicating that most rain events occur in southern and eastern china benchmarked by gauge observations v03 f v04 f and v05 f all exhibit good capacity in capturing the spatial characteristics of daily mean precipitation over mainland china fig 5 b d however all versions seem to overestimate precipitation in southeastern and northeastern china impressively it is abnormal that v04 f shows banded distribution of precipitation in tp and xj which disappears in the latest v05 f fig 5 e f are snapshots of mean daily precipitation difference between v04 f and v03 f and between v05 f and v03 f it is obvious that v04 f tends to produce higher precipitation than v03 f in northern and central cj northern sw and southwestern se where v05 f also shows overestimation but with milder magnitude in southern tp v04 f produces much lower precipitation but v05 f shows no apparent difference table 2 shows the summary of evaluation metrics calculated with the mean value over the whole country at hourly and daily scales it s clear that all indices look satisfying at both scales the high cc values more than 0 9 indicate strong correlation between imerg products and gauge based observation implying the capacity of imerg to quantify precipitation time series over large regions the β values larger than 1 indicate overestimation of the satellite precipitation estimates in china to further investigate this phenomenon the gpcc monitoring product version 4 which is used as the calibrator in imerg final run products schneider et al 2011 huffman et al 2017a b is compared with gauge data at the monthly temporal resolution all gauges are categorized into gpcc 1 1 grid cells and only grid cells with at least one gauge are chosen to conduct evaluation and if there is more than one gauge in one grid cell averaged value is employed the β value calculated by mean coincident gpcc and gauge data is 1 11 which is almost same as the β values by comparing various imerg products to gauge data shown in table 2 this finding implies that gpcc calibration for imerg final run products tends to overestimate precipitation over mainland china leading to the overestimation of imerg more representative ground stations are required to be included into gpcc networks in china to improve the performance of satellite precipitation estimates the rmse values are low at the hourly scale and they become higher at the daily scale due to error accumulation good performance of contingency indices pod far and csi demonstrates the capacity of imerg products to capture most precipitation events accurately in china on the whole the performance of v04 f and v05 f is comparable with v03 f as the average of the whole country 4 2 2 grid based evaluation 4 2 2 1 probability density function of precipitation intensity probability density function pdf is widely used for comparing characteristics of different precipitation data sets in terms of precipitation intensity and estimation sensitivity kirstetter et al 2013 chen et al 2013 in addition pdf is good at describing light precipitation rates kirstetter et al 2013 which makes it a good method to investigate the performance of imerg to detect light precipitation tang et al 2016a fig 6 shows the pdfs of imerg v03 f v04 f and v05 f at hourly and daily resolutions with different precipitation intensities over mainland china benchmarked by gauge observations the first bin of both two scenarios is set to 0 0 1 mm h or mm day i e no rain and presented separately due to its large proportion for the hourly scenario shown in fig 6 a more than 90 precipitation is under 0 1 mm h v03 f shows obvious overestimation in this bin while v04 f and v05 f have similar proportions with gauge observations which demonstrates the improvement of v04 f and v05 f in detecting no rain events in terms of nonzero rain events the most evident difference occurs in bins ranging from 0 1 mm h to 0 4 mm h for bins ranging from 0 1 mm h to 0 2 mm h all products underestimate precipitation rates with various degrees while for bins ranging from 0 2 mm h to 0 4 mm h v03 f and v05 f show underestimation but v04 f shows obvious overestimation as for moderate and heavy rains greater than 0 6 mm h the three products appear to have more precipitation than gauge observations this patterns could account for the overall overestimation of imerg products indicated by bias ratio greater than1 in table 2 for the daily scenario shown in fig 6 b the distribution patterns of three estimates show higher consistence nevertheless v03 f overestimates no rain events and reduces its proportion in light precipitation 0 1 1 mm day on the contrary v04 f and v05 f underestimate no rain events and increase their proportions in nonzero precipitation 0 1 mm day in general v03 f v04 f and v05 f have comparable capacity of reproducing the pdf structure of precipitation at hourly and daily scales 4 2 2 2 statistical evaluation of imerg products fig 7 shows the box plot of grid scale statistics for imerg v03 f v04 f and v05 f at hourly and daily scales over mainland china for each box the central mark is the median and the edges of the box are the 25th and 75th percentiles the percentage of points that the whiskers span is set to 9 and 91 plotted by horizontal bands the purple line represents the perfect value for each indicator at the hourly scale v04 f shows similar performance with v03 f concerning cc β γ and kge while v05 f seems to outperform the other two versions with higher cc and kge as for contingency statistics v04 f and v05 f have much higher pod than v03 f but at the same time the far of them also increases by similar magnitudes which leads to the same level of csi at the daily scale the difference among the three products is very similar to that at the hourly scenario table 3 summarizes specific values of statistic metrics the mean hourly cc value increases from 0 31 for v03 f and v04 f to 0 36 for v05 f correspondingly the mean hourly kge increases from 0 13 for v03 f and v04 f to 0 18 for v05 f with respect to the hourly rmse v05 f has a lower value 0 93 mm compared to the value 1 04 mm for v03 f and v04 f overall v05 f is the best in terms of averaged statistics over mainland china while v04 f shows even slightly worse performance than v03 f to further reveal the error characteristics of imerg final run products over different parts of china more detailed statistics at the hourly scale for eight sub regions is also provided in table 3 all the three versions of imerg have relatively better performance in cj sw and se with high cc larger than 0 3 kge larger than 0 2 and csi about 0 3 comparing with low cc lower than 0 25 kge lower than 0 1 and csi lower than 0 20 in xj and tp the bad performance in xj and tp may be attributed to complicated terrain and severe climate conditions it is worth noting that v03 f v04 f and v05 f greatly overestimate the precipitation in ne with the β of 1 52 1 51 and 1 55 respectively great overestimation can also be found in nc 1 39 1 38 and 1 39 for v03 f v04 f and v05 f respectively and nw 1 37 1 33 and 1 42 for v03 f v04 f and v05 f respectively which are in the south and west to ne respectively this phenomenon implies that the version 03 04 and 05 retrievals of imerg all have great uncertainty in estimating precipitation in northern china with high latitudes despite all this when considering all eight indices comprehensively v05 f shows apparent improvement over v03 f and v04 f in eastern china and southern china while v03 f and v04 f have comparable performance with each other while over western regions 03 f and v05 f show overestimation in tp with the β of 1 25 while v04 f exhibits severe underestimation with the β of 0 7 the severe underestimation shown by v04 f over tp is also proved in wei et al 2017 and zhao et al 2017 similar phenomenon can also be found in xj where v04 f exhibits much lower approximately 30 and better much close to 1 β than the other two versions in previous studies v03 f has shown a significant overestimation in tp tang et al 2016a ma et al 2017 so estimation of lower precipitation of v04 f in that areas seems reasonable to some extent fig 5 e however the severe underestimation of v04 f demonstrates that v04 f actually estimate too few precipitation amounts in that regions in xj the good performance of v04 f in terms of β is offset by its extremely bad γ values which makes v04 f the worst precipitation products as the integrated index kge indicates it suggests that v04 f could produce accurate total precipitation amounts but the poor estimates of the distribution of precipitation rates instead v05 f shows the best performance in the complex xj and tp areas indicated by the highest cc kge and csi values nevertheless the performance of all three version products at the hourly scale still has much room to be improved 4 2 2 3 taylor diagrams for evaluation metrics similar to table 3 detailed statistics about the error characteristics of imerg early and late run products over mainland china and eight sub regions are provided in table 4 in addition taylor diagrams taylor 2001 are plotted to graphically summarize how well the seven different precipitation estimates v03 e v03 l v03 f v04 e v04 l v04 f and v05 f match the gauge observations in terms of cc standard deviation and centered rmse fig 8 in the taylor diagrams the uneven angular coordinate is cc represented by blue dash and dot lines and the radical coordinate is standard deviation normalized by the standard deviation value of gauge observation and represented by black dotted lines in addition the green concentric semi circles centered by observation represents centered rmse values the gauge observation is marked by a red star and the closer the marker of precipitation estimates is to the gauge observation the better performance the product has the taylor diagrams suggest that final run of v03 and v04 don t show expected improvements compared with their early and late run algorithms in most areas at the hourly scale over china as for real time precipitation products the late run shows very similar performance to the early run of the same version while v04 early late run has better performance than v03 products in most regions except xj and tp implying that the great uncertainty in v04 f over western china could be sourced into the algorithms of early run as for post real time precipitation products v05 f improves the quality of precipitation estimates over almost all regions compared to v04 f and v03 f in western and northern china it is evident that different precipitation estimates have large variations which may be due to the huge challenge brought by snow and ice and complex terrain in precipitation retrieval 4 2 2 4 spatial differences among the different imerg versions fig 9 displays the spatial distributions of representative evaluation metrics cc β γ kge pod far and csi of imerg v05 f and the differences between v05 f and v03 f and between v04 f and v03 f over mainland china the spatial distribution of v05 f statistics is plotted to represent the performance of imerg products as their similarities the β difference is calculated by measuring the difference between the absolute error of v05 f v04 f and v03 f to 1 0 therefore negative β difference means v05 f v04 f tends to produce more accurate estimates than v03 f the γ difference is calculated through the same way and the other differences are calculated by simply subtracting the indices of v03 f from that of v05 f v04 f as for cc v05 f are in better agreement with gauge data in southern and eastern china with higher cc than other areas which is consistent with previous studies tang et al 2016a chen and li 2016 the cc is much worse in northern and western china with values lower than 0 2 in some areas in addition the kge and csi values of v05 f share very similar distribution patterns with cc the underlying reasons for the low performance over western and northern areas include uneven topography complex climatic and weather conditions posing great challenge to satellite precipitation retrieval dinku et al 2007 tang et al 2018b it should be noted that gauges in such regions are also subject to more severe observation errors such as wind and snowfall induced error measurement which contributes to the uncertainty in evaluation yang et al 2001 adam and lettenmaier 2003 considering the comparisons between new versions and the old one v05 f demonstrates better estimations than v04 f and v03 f across the whole country with higher cc kge and comparable csi in particular v04 f shows worse quality than v03 f in tp indicated by negative differences of cc kge and csi while the latest v05 f gets rid of the retrogressive performance of v04 f and evidently improves the performance in those high altitude and complicated regions the spatial distributions of contingency statistics difference are distinct from that of continuous statistics concerning pod v05 f shows better performance than v03 f in most regions except nc and northern sw while v04 f is much better than v03 f in southeastern china i e cj and se but can t reach the level of v03 f in other regions meanwhile the higher pod of v05 f and v04 f are accompanied by worse far fig 9 q r in those corresponding regions as a consequence the distributions of csi difference exhibit large variability over most parts of cj and se v05 f and v04 f has larger csi than v03 f due to the improvement of pod surpasses the deterioration of far while over most parts of nc and northern sw the csi of v05 f and v04 f is far inferior to that of v03 f caused by poorer pod and far 4 2 2 5 spatial differences within imerg early and late run four imerg near real time estimates v03 e v04 e v03 l and v04 l are also included into spatial analysis at the hourly scale over mainland china fig 10 shows the spatial distributions of metric differences between imerg v03 e and v04 e and between imerg v03 l and v04 l as for imerg early run v04 e is quite different from v03 e firstly v04 e has larger cc over most parts of central and southern china i e nc cj sw and se and xj and the improvement is more significant and widely distributed compared with the final run case in fig 9 c the average cc increases from 0 27 to 0 31 compared v04 e to v03 e across the whole mainland china secondly the performance difference indicated by kge is extremely significant fig 10 b improvements of v04 in kge can be found over ne cj and se but degeneration is apparent over tp xj and central nc thirdly the rmse difference is obviously negative over the western and northern china except central nc where rmse difference is extremely positive and the difference is mostly positive over southern parts finally the csi of v04 e is higher in southern nw central and southern cj and western se but notably lower in ne northern sw and tp compared with that of v03 e the average csi difference is almost zero which could be attributed to the offset between better pod and worse far of v04 e as for imerg late run products shown in fig 10 e h the spatial distribution characteristics of the four indices are almost the same as the early run comparison in general imerg v04 early and late run products are only more effective than v03 over cj and se while over other regions the new versions show similar or even worse performance than the old versions 5 summary and conclusion in this study the newly imerg v05 final run products and its previous versions imerg v03 and v04 are firstly intercompared over the globe at daily temporal resolution also cross evaluated against the globally reanalyzed benchmark gpcp 2 3 and mswep 2 1 with analysis on spatial distributions and latitudinal mean profiles then the early late and final run products of imerg v03 v04 and v05 are carefully evaluated over mainland china against more than 30 000 gauges at hourly and daily temporal resolutions and 0 1 0 1 spatial resolution the conclusions of this study mainly contain 1 imerg v04 f and v05 f products show significant difference and improvements compared to v03 f over ocean according to statistics mean precipitation of v04 f and v05 f increases by 31 36 and 28 81 respectively compared with that of v03 f over ocean in general the significant increase of v04 f and v05 f over ocean is reasonable as the average oceanic precipitation of v04 f and v05 f is 3 10 mm day and 3 04 mm day which is much closer to that of the benchmark gpcp 2 94 mm day and mswep 2 93 mm day than that of v03 f 2 36 mm day the ocean regions with much improved values are northeastern and mid southern pacific ocean northwestern and southwestern atlantic ocean and the equatorial zones however the difference over land is less significant 2 at the national averaged scale over mainland china high cc that is more than 0 9 at the hourly scale and even larger at the daily scale indicates that all imerg versions have the ability to represent the precipitation time series over large regions even though all of them overestimate precipitation values with β of about 1 12 at all resolutions the performance of v03 f v04 f and v05 f are about the same at the national averaged scale 3 at grid based scale v03 f v04 f and v05 f all could basically describe the pdf structure of precipitation over mainland china in particular v04 f and v05 f outperforms v03 f for zero or little precipitation 0 0 4 mm h at the hourly scale while v03 f has better capacity for moderate and heavy precipitation both at hourly 0 4 mm h and daily scales 1 mm day overall imerg v05 f precipitation products generally improves upon its last two predecessors v04 f and v03 f at the hourly scale across the whole country which could demonstrate the advancement of the latest imerg v05 algorithms while v04 f only shows comparable performance with v03 f 4 the quality of v03 v04 and v05 is heterogeneous in different areas of mainland china as a whole the improvement from imerg v03 f to v05 f is more concentrated in southeastern china e g lower reaches of changjiang river and the pearl river and western china e g tp and xj both v04 f and v05 f show worse performance in precipitation occurrence identification in central and northern china than v03 f in addition compared with its processor v03 f v04 f exhibits retrogressive performance in northern and western china which are subject to complex terrain or snow and ice during winter when comparing all seven imerg precipitation products it is evident that v05 f gives a relatively better performance than other estimates in china especially nw ne nc and cj besides v04 real time estimates have better performance in most regions than v03 except xj and tp while the early and late run of the same version generally show similar performance in summary imerg v04 and v05 show significant improvements from their predecessors v03 basically over oceans while over lands represented by mainland china v04 and v03 are about the same level while v05 is identified to be the best performed precipitation estimates in addition there should call on more localized studies to investigate into specific regions with ground gauge radar combined networks as well as reanalysis further investigations should be also carried out to assess the underlying insights from imerg level 2 retrieval algorithms for error and uncertainty and how the uncertainty propagating to the imerg level 3 precipitation products acknowledgements

7072,the overarching goal of this study is to intercompare the newly released integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg version 05 v05 products with its former version 04 v04 and version 03 v03 products and also assess any differences and improvements with cross evaluation against the global precipitation climatology project gpcp version 2 3 multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep version 2 1 and the dense gauge networks in china firstly the gauge adjusted products final run of v03 v04 and v05 are compared over the globe then the near real time products without gauge adjustments early and late run and final run products of all versions are evaluated against ground based observations comprised of more than 30 000 gauges over mainland china at 0 1 0 1 grid and hourly and daily temporal scales the primary conclusions are 1 globally both v04 and v05 final run show significant differences and improvements from v03 particularly the overall mean oceanic precipitation of v04 and v05 increases by 31 36 and 28 81 respectively from that of v03 and much closer to gpcp and mswep 2 over mainland china the early and late run products of the same version v03 or v04 generally have similar performance while v04 early and late run have better performance in most regions than the corresponding run of v03 except in the arid xinjiang province and the mountainous tibetan plateau and 3 v04 and v03 final run show comparable performance while v05 final run generally improves upon both v04 and v03 and has the best performance among the seven standard imerg products the improvement of v05 final run is particularly evident in southeastern and western china at a timely matter the study provides first hand global and regional assessment feedback to imerg algorithm developers and also sheds insights for gpm precipitation product users across the world keywords precipitation satellite gpm imerg 1 introduction precipitation is a vital variable in the global water and energy cycle kidd and huffman 2011 and precise precipitation measurement has direct benefits on water resource management disaster prevention weather prediction and so on hou et al 2014 ma et al 2017 however precipitation measurement has always been a highly demanding yet challenging research topic for scientists typically there are three main methods to measure precipitation i e rain gauges weather radars and satellite based remote sensing yong et al 2015 satellite based remote sensing gives a complementary perspective for precipitation measurement compared with traditional ground based observations and is the only effective way to obtain comprehensive precipitation measurement at the global scale hong et al 2012 hou et al 2014 tang et al 2017 since the launch of the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm satellite by the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and the japan aerospace exploration agency jaxa in 1997 a large number of scientists have developed diverse quasi global satellite based precipitation products through different techniques huffman et al 2007 joyce et al 2004 sorooshian et al 2000 hong et al 2004 kubota et al 2007 as the successor of trmm the global precipitation measurement gpm mission led by nasa and jaxa is the state of the art precipitation measurement program in the world on february 28 2014 the gpm core observatory was successfully launched the gpm constellation is composed of the core observatory and other approximately eight partner satellites the gpm core observatory carries the first spaceborne dual frequency phased array precipitation radar the dpr the ku band at 13 6 ghz and ka band at 35 5 ghz and a multichannel gpm microwave imager the gmi frequency ranging from 10 to 183 ghz the two instruments dpr and gmi are the more advanced versions compared to precipitation radar pr and trmm microwave imager tmi onboard the trmm satellite therefore the capability of detecting light rain and snow is improved and the two instruments dpr and gmi act as an intercalibration library to unify observations from diverse partner constellation radiometers tapiador et al 2012 hou et al 2014 the level 3 products of gpm produced by the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg are widely used among hydrology communities imerg products were firstly provided by nasa as version 03 v03 from march 2014 many researchers have published a series of studies to reveal characteristics of uncertainties and errors of imerg v03 products tang et al 2016a b ma et al 2016 li et al 2017 guo et al 2016 gaona et al 2016 tan et al 2016 2017 asong et al 2017 mayor et al 2017 precipitation processing system pps the organization at nasa goddard space flight center gsfc that processes and distributes precipitation records from gpm releases newer imerg version 04 v04 and version 05 v05 final run products successively on march 22 and november 20 2017 the changes from v03 to v04 and from v04 to v05 are multifactorial imerg v04 experienced several upgrades compared to the previous v03 for example imerg v04 employs the 2017 version 1 of the goddard profiling algorithm gprof2017 v1 to compute precipitation estimates from all microwave sensors which is an upgrade version compared with gprof2014 used in imerg v03 furthermore the advanced temperature and moisture sounder atms a multi channel passive microwave radiometer is added as a new source of precipitation estimates additional changes from v03 to v04 include calibrating infrared ir estimates dynamically to the imerg high quality hq data calibrating 2bcmb to gpcp v2 3 over ocean at middle and high latitudes and over land globally extending imerg hq data coverage from 60 n s to 90 n s correcting the bug that mistakenly assigned 1 3 kalman weighting to ir in certain cases and so on huffman et al 2017c on the basis of imerg v04 the latest v05 applies a more advanced version of gprof v05 to compute microwave based precipitation estimates in addition more fields and components are added into v05 products for example gprof estimates from all available microwave sensors are provided in the hqprecipitation field the quality index is also added for all half hour and monthly v05 products when combing the satellite estimates with gauge observations gauge error estimates are defined to provide feasible weights for correction meanwhile some procedures of imerg algorithms which are associated with potential issues are removed for safety for example the tmi estimates are not computed in gprof and the mhs and atms estimates are also restricted to specific footprints at each swath edge which is treated to reduce the amount of microwave based precipitation estimates to some extent huffman et al 2017e the transition from v04 to v05 only takes eight months in addition to our best knowledge currently there is no study analyzing the quality of imerg v05 products and comprehensively intercomparing imerg v03 v04 and v05 to clarify their similarities differences and improvements huffman et al 2017e conducted initial validation for imerg final run products compared to the multi radar multisensor mrms based ground observations over conterminous us wei et al 2017 evaluated imerg v03 v04 and other satellite based precipitation products with gauge observations in three climatologic zones in china and found v04 didn t show an advantage over v03 in the tibetan plateau region and the weihe river basin zhao et al 2017 investigated the successive imerg v03 and v04 final run products with a comparison of the china daily precipitation analysis products with a resolution of 0 25 0 25 over mainland china and also found that v04 didn t exhibit the anticipated improvement for china compared to v03 su et al 2018 evaluated the daily precipitation product from imerg v04 final run for monitoring three heavy rain events mainly over eastern china in 2016 and proved that the daily imerg v04 final run products can basically capture the spatiotemporal patterns of heavy rain events therefore it is urgent to address the following question which is crucial for hydrology applications how do the three versions of imerg products perform both at global and regional scales the objectives of this study are twofold 1 intercomparing imerg v03 v04 and v05 final run products over the globe at 0 1 0 1 daily resolutions 2 evaluating and comparing imerg v03 v04 and v05 early late and final run products over mainland china at 0 1 0 1 spatial resolution and multiple temporal resolutions hourly and daily against ground based observations from the china meteorological administration cma the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 mainly describes the study areas and data sets section 3 introduces the methodology i e calculation of evaluation metrics section 4 intercompares and evaluates imerg v03 v04 and v05 finally the conclusions discussions and recommended future works are introduced in section 5 2 study area and data sets 2 1 study area in global analysis the study area covers 60 n s in regional analysis the study area is mainland china fig 1 a eight sub regions are defined in fig 1 b according to chen et al 2013 and guo et al 2016 to comprehensively investigate the error characteristics of imerg products depending on topography tang et al 2006 and climatic conditions guo et al 2007 tang et al 2016a qian and lin 2005 the sub regions are 1 the xinjiang xj region in central asia which is dominated by an arid or semiarid climate with little precipitation over the whole year 2 the qinghai tibetan plateau tp dominated by the plateau mountain climate with high altitude complex topography and significant precipitation variability 3 northwestern china nw bounded by the 400 mm annual precipitation isohyet 4 northeastern china ne located in the north of the yan mountains 5 northern china nc located in the north of the qinling mountains and the huai river the climate of nw ne and nc is primarily controlled by the temperate continental climate with a hot and wet summer and a cold and dry winter 6 the plain region of changjiang yangtze river cj located in the middle lower reaches of yangtze river 7 the yungui plateau in southwestern china sw is bounded by the dabashan mountains to the north and the wulingshan mountains to the east 8 southeast china se bounded by the nanling mountains to the north and the wuyishan mountains to the northwest the climate of cj and se is primarily controlled by the subtropical or tropical monsoon from the western pacific ocean characterized by a hot and wet summer and a mild and dry winter while the major factor affecting the climate of sw is the monsoon between the tp and the indian ocean 2 2 data sets 2 2 1 satellite precipitation estimates data sets the imerg system merges all available satellite microwave precipitation estimates microwave calibrated ir estimates ground gauge analyses and potentially other estimates at 0 1 0 1 spatial and half hour temporal resolutions huffman et al 2017f g imerg provides three kinds of products including early and late run about 4 h and 12 h respectively after observation and final run about 2 months after the observation month huffman et al 2017a b early and late run products are produced in near real time and calibrated with climatological coefficients varying by month and location in contrast the final run product is produced post real time after gauge adjustments to be consistent with the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc precipitation data huffman et al 2017f g therefore the final run product is characterized by higher accuracy particularly over land while the early and late run products have better timeliness which is appealing to flood forecast and monitoring in this study the final run products of imerg v03 v03 f v04 v04 f and v05 v05 f and the early and late run products of imerg v03 v03 e and v03 l respectively and v04 v04 e and v04 l respectively are used as imerg v05 early and late run products are not available yet they are absent in the study huffman et al 2017d for the final run imerg v03 f v04 f and v05 f are intercompared from june 1 2014 to may 31 2015 because imerg v03 f stopped updating in february 2016 and a full two year overlapping dataset is not available for the early and late run imerg v03 e v03 l and v04 e v04 l are compared from june 1 2015 to may 31 2016 because imerg v03 early and late run products were available since march 2015 the raw resolutions of these products are 0 1 0 1 and half hour hourly and daily data sets used in this study are accumulated from half hourly data sets the imerg data could be downloaded from the precipitation measurement missions pmm website huffman et al 2017h https pmm nasa gov data access downloads gpm the absence of accurate and independent surface based observations across the globe makes it impossible to directly evaluate the quality of imerg products globally as an alternative strategy two other global precipitation products are used as the reference in the intercomparison one is the global precipitation climatology project gpcp version 2 3 monthly precipitation data set at 2 5 2 5 spatial resolution adler et al 2003 2017 gpcp combines various satellite precipitation products over ocean and land and a gauge analysis over land to provide a consistent estimation of global precipitation huffman et al 1997 gpcp has become a robust and widely used global precipitation product after several iterations of improvements another product is multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep version 2 1 which is a new global precipitation data set at 3 hourly temporal and 0 1 0 1 spatial resolution beck et al 2017a mswep utilizes various gauge satellite and reanalysis based data to produce an integrated precipitation estimates over the globe beck et al 2017a and it performed best among 22 precipitation datasets in a comprehensive global evaluation beck et al 2017b the potential issue for the intercomparison using other global precipitation datasets such as gpcp and mswep is that they may have some overlapping precipitation data sources as imerg products for example both gpcp and iemrg contain gpcc for bias correction and share some of input datasets e g ir and special sensor microwave imager sounder ssmis data adler et al 2018 however the three global precipitation estimates imerg gpcp and mswep are produced by different retrieval algorithms and the relative difference of imerg v03 v04 and v05 that the paper focuses on are mainly due to the update of imerg algorithms but not the input datasets moreover the employment of two benchmarks gpcp and mswep would also contribute to the confidence of the intercomparison not just over land but more importantly over ocean where there are no such anchors like gpcc for bias correction the gpcp v2 3 could be accessed from physical science division psd in noaa https www esrl noaa gov psd data gridded data gpcp html and mswep could be accessed in the website of toward locally relevant global hydrological simulations gloh2o http www gloh2o org 2 2 2 rain gauge data sets more than 30 000 gauges over mainland china are adopted to provide hourly ground based precipitation observations as independent reference from june 1 2014 to may 31 2016 shen et al 2014 all gauges are categorized into imerg 0 1 0 1 grid cells only grid cells with at least one gauge are chosen to conduct evaluation and if more than one gauge in one grid cell averaged value is employed this processing method has been widely used in many other similar works cohen liechti et al 2012 demaria et al 2011 liebmann and allured 2005 ma et al 2018 salio et al 2015 tang et al 2018a xu et al 2017 the hourly gauge observations go through several steps of quality control including 1 eliminating extreme values 2 examining internal consistency and 3 examining spatial consistency shen et al 2010 the spatial distribution of gauge density is displayed in fig 1 a the majority of gauges are located in southern and eastern china while fewer gauges are located in northern and western china note that the limited gauges especially in northern and western china could contribute to the uncertainties in the evaluation of imerg products as said before gpcc networks are used as reference to adjust imerg final run products however gpcc networks only use data from 194 china s stations which means that the gauges used in this paper more than 30 000 are mostly 99 independent of gpcc networks shen et al 2013 guaranteeing the reliability of evaluation results besides the gauge adjustments for imerg final run products are conducted at the monthly scale while the evaluation of this paper are carried out at hourly and daily scales 3 methodology to quantify the accuracy of imerg products of different versions eight statistic metrics are used in this study table 1 the pearson correlation coefficient cc describing the linear correlation level between satellite precipitation estimates and gauge observations is able to measure the capability of reproducing the temporal variations the bias ratio β describing the error and bias is able to measure the overestimation β 1 or underestimation β 1 of satellite precipitation products the variability ratio γ describes the difference of the distributions of precipitation products and gauge observations the modified kling gupta efficiency kge is an integrated statistic consisting of cc β and γ kling et al 2012 zambrano bigiarini et al 2017 another indice describing errors is the root mean square error rmse contingency table indices which include the probability of detection pod the false alarm ratio far and the critical success index csi are included to describe the consistency between estimated and observed rain event occurrence the rain no rain threshold is set to 0 1 mm for both hourly and daily scales tang et al 2016a 4 results 4 1 global intercomparison between imerg v03 v04 and v05 products 4 1 1 global view of the spatial difference the spatial distribution of global mean daily precipitation of imerg v05 f is shown in fig 2 a in addition by subtracting v03 f v04 f and v05 f precipitation rates from those of gpcp the spatial differences between the three products and gpcp are displayed in fig 2 b d respectively the resolution of v03 f v04 f v05 f and mswep is averaged to 2 5 2 5 to be consistent with gpcp over the global ocean the mean precipitation rate of v04 f and v05 f is 3 10 and 3 04 mm day which is about 30 higher than that of v03 f 2 36 mm day and much closer to that of the globally reanalyzed benchmark gpcp 2 94 mm day mswep 2 93 mm day this phenomenon could mainly be attributed to the upgraded schemes both in v04 and v05 that climatologically calibrates the gmi dpr combined level 2 product 2bcmb to gpcp v2 3 over ocean at middle and high latitudes huffman et al 2017a b 2bcmb is the calibrator for all of the passive microwave radiometers in the gpm constellation besides the upgraded gprof algorithms gprof2017 version 1 for v04 and gprof v05 for v05 are also contributed to the significant differences according to the study by behrangi et al 2014 the near global 60 n s oceanic precipitation rate for 3 yr 2007 09 by the merged precipitation estimate from the cloudsat trmm and aqua platforms mcta climate prediction center merged analysis of precipitation cmap and gpcp version 2 2 is 3 13 2 96 and 2 97 mm day respectively which could further demonstrate the consistency between oceanic precipitation estimates from v04 f v05 f and other satellite precipitation products while over the global land different products have relatively comparable mean daily precipitation rates about 2 30 mm day for v03 f v04 f v05 f and gpcp and about 2 22 mm day for mswep which is mainly due to the gauge correction composition gpcc in most precipitation products over land over ocean as shown in fig 2 b d v04 f and v05 f precipitation is much larger and closer to gpcp than v03 f s e g northeastern and mid southern pacific ocean northwestern and southwestern atlantic ocean and the equatorial zones while over land the three versions have similar spatial distributions of the differences with gpcp and the differences between v03 f and v04 f v05 f are relatively small with negative and positive differences distributing alternatively this result can be partially attributed to the rough spatial average for imerg products from 0 1 0 1 to 2 5 2 5 grids which makes slight differences invisible thus more specific evaluation at imerg s raw spatial resolution should be carried out over land e g the mainland china which is executed as below seasonal differences between imerg v03 f and v05 f are also analyzed as representation fig 3 there are notable positive differences over ocean in all seasons particularly in equatorial and high latitudes and the difference in mam is relatively small in contrast over land most regions have relatively low differences and apparent differences only occur in equatorial regions such as northern south america and central africa in addition the difference exhibits strong seasonality over some land regions e g the distinctive difference in india and southern and western china mainly occurs in jja when the monsoon is dominant in those regions the seasonality of differences can also be found in northwest pacific ocean where there are large positive adjustments in jja but negative adjustments in djf however along both sides of the equator in middle and east pacific ocean and atlantic ocean the difference remains similar in all four seasons 4 1 2 analysis on zonal mean fig 4 presents the curves of the latitudinal distribution of the annual mean precipitation for imerg v03 f v04 f v05 f gpcp and mswep over both ocean and land over ocean the profile curves of five products have similar latitudinal pattern and they are stable and smooth the rainfall peak is located at 6 5 n this is mainly due to the intertropical convergence zone itcz where a large number of precipitation events move forward north of the equator in boreal summer wu et al 2003 on the contrary the minimum rainfall amount is located near the tropics of cancer and capricorn 23 5 n s and 60 s as the prevalence of downdraft under the control of high pressure in these areas hendon et al 2014 compared with v03 f the curves of v04 f and v05 f are much closer to that of gpcp and mswep especially between 0 and 20 n and between 10 s and 20 s v04 f and v05 f show slight overestimation than benchmarks overall while v03 f has significant underestimation mostly occurring in high latitude zones and equatorial zones see fig 2 b over land it is noted that the variation of precipitation profiles is much larger and complicated than that over ocean which is mainly due to the widespread variability of continental precipitation related to topography at local scale yong et al 2015 the maximum rainfall over land is located at about 1 5 s furthermore the curves of v03 f v04 f v05 f and gpcp are quite close to each other especially between 20 n s this is mainly because of the rain gauge adjustments using the gpcc full analysis for imerg final run products over land mswep shows smaller magnitudes than other four products for most latitude ranges while relatively large values appear near the 50 s 4 2 evaluation of imerg v03 v04 and v05 in china in this section the products including imerg v03 v03 e v03 l and v03 f v04 v04 e v04 l and v04 f and v05 v05 f are evaluated in china using independent high density ground gauges the evaluation of imerg products in china is executed in two different perspectives i e national based and grid based in order to enhance the reliability of the evaluation conclusions in national based evaluation the different versions of imerg products are compared using averaged values over the whole country in grid based evaluation the different versions are compared using the exact value at each grid cell the period for the final run products is from june 2014 to may 2015 at 0 1 0 1 spatial resolution and hourly and daily temporal resolutions while the early and late run products are from june 2015 to may 2016 at 0 1 0 1 spatial resolution and hourly temporal resolution 4 2 1 national based evaluation the spatial distribution of gauge based mean daily precipitation over china is shown in fig 5 a indicating that most rain events occur in southern and eastern china benchmarked by gauge observations v03 f v04 f and v05 f all exhibit good capacity in capturing the spatial characteristics of daily mean precipitation over mainland china fig 5 b d however all versions seem to overestimate precipitation in southeastern and northeastern china impressively it is abnormal that v04 f shows banded distribution of precipitation in tp and xj which disappears in the latest v05 f fig 5 e f are snapshots of mean daily precipitation difference between v04 f and v03 f and between v05 f and v03 f it is obvious that v04 f tends to produce higher precipitation than v03 f in northern and central cj northern sw and southwestern se where v05 f also shows overestimation but with milder magnitude in southern tp v04 f produces much lower precipitation but v05 f shows no apparent difference table 2 shows the summary of evaluation metrics calculated with the mean value over the whole country at hourly and daily scales it s clear that all indices look satisfying at both scales the high cc values more than 0 9 indicate strong correlation between imerg products and gauge based observation implying the capacity of imerg to quantify precipitation time series over large regions the β values larger than 1 indicate overestimation of the satellite precipitation estimates in china to further investigate this phenomenon the gpcc monitoring product version 4 which is used as the calibrator in imerg final run products schneider et al 2011 huffman et al 2017a b is compared with gauge data at the monthly temporal resolution all gauges are categorized into gpcc 1 1 grid cells and only grid cells with at least one gauge are chosen to conduct evaluation and if there is more than one gauge in one grid cell averaged value is employed the β value calculated by mean coincident gpcc and gauge data is 1 11 which is almost same as the β values by comparing various imerg products to gauge data shown in table 2 this finding implies that gpcc calibration for imerg final run products tends to overestimate precipitation over mainland china leading to the overestimation of imerg more representative ground stations are required to be included into gpcc networks in china to improve the performance of satellite precipitation estimates the rmse values are low at the hourly scale and they become higher at the daily scale due to error accumulation good performance of contingency indices pod far and csi demonstrates the capacity of imerg products to capture most precipitation events accurately in china on the whole the performance of v04 f and v05 f is comparable with v03 f as the average of the whole country 4 2 2 grid based evaluation 4 2 2 1 probability density function of precipitation intensity probability density function pdf is widely used for comparing characteristics of different precipitation data sets in terms of precipitation intensity and estimation sensitivity kirstetter et al 2013 chen et al 2013 in addition pdf is good at describing light precipitation rates kirstetter et al 2013 which makes it a good method to investigate the performance of imerg to detect light precipitation tang et al 2016a fig 6 shows the pdfs of imerg v03 f v04 f and v05 f at hourly and daily resolutions with different precipitation intensities over mainland china benchmarked by gauge observations the first bin of both two scenarios is set to 0 0 1 mm h or mm day i e no rain and presented separately due to its large proportion for the hourly scenario shown in fig 6 a more than 90 precipitation is under 0 1 mm h v03 f shows obvious overestimation in this bin while v04 f and v05 f have similar proportions with gauge observations which demonstrates the improvement of v04 f and v05 f in detecting no rain events in terms of nonzero rain events the most evident difference occurs in bins ranging from 0 1 mm h to 0 4 mm h for bins ranging from 0 1 mm h to 0 2 mm h all products underestimate precipitation rates with various degrees while for bins ranging from 0 2 mm h to 0 4 mm h v03 f and v05 f show underestimation but v04 f shows obvious overestimation as for moderate and heavy rains greater than 0 6 mm h the three products appear to have more precipitation than gauge observations this patterns could account for the overall overestimation of imerg products indicated by bias ratio greater than1 in table 2 for the daily scenario shown in fig 6 b the distribution patterns of three estimates show higher consistence nevertheless v03 f overestimates no rain events and reduces its proportion in light precipitation 0 1 1 mm day on the contrary v04 f and v05 f underestimate no rain events and increase their proportions in nonzero precipitation 0 1 mm day in general v03 f v04 f and v05 f have comparable capacity of reproducing the pdf structure of precipitation at hourly and daily scales 4 2 2 2 statistical evaluation of imerg products fig 7 shows the box plot of grid scale statistics for imerg v03 f v04 f and v05 f at hourly and daily scales over mainland china for each box the central mark is the median and the edges of the box are the 25th and 75th percentiles the percentage of points that the whiskers span is set to 9 and 91 plotted by horizontal bands the purple line represents the perfect value for each indicator at the hourly scale v04 f shows similar performance with v03 f concerning cc β γ and kge while v05 f seems to outperform the other two versions with higher cc and kge as for contingency statistics v04 f and v05 f have much higher pod than v03 f but at the same time the far of them also increases by similar magnitudes which leads to the same level of csi at the daily scale the difference among the three products is very similar to that at the hourly scenario table 3 summarizes specific values of statistic metrics the mean hourly cc value increases from 0 31 for v03 f and v04 f to 0 36 for v05 f correspondingly the mean hourly kge increases from 0 13 for v03 f and v04 f to 0 18 for v05 f with respect to the hourly rmse v05 f has a lower value 0 93 mm compared to the value 1 04 mm for v03 f and v04 f overall v05 f is the best in terms of averaged statistics over mainland china while v04 f shows even slightly worse performance than v03 f to further reveal the error characteristics of imerg final run products over different parts of china more detailed statistics at the hourly scale for eight sub regions is also provided in table 3 all the three versions of imerg have relatively better performance in cj sw and se with high cc larger than 0 3 kge larger than 0 2 and csi about 0 3 comparing with low cc lower than 0 25 kge lower than 0 1 and csi lower than 0 20 in xj and tp the bad performance in xj and tp may be attributed to complicated terrain and severe climate conditions it is worth noting that v03 f v04 f and v05 f greatly overestimate the precipitation in ne with the β of 1 52 1 51 and 1 55 respectively great overestimation can also be found in nc 1 39 1 38 and 1 39 for v03 f v04 f and v05 f respectively and nw 1 37 1 33 and 1 42 for v03 f v04 f and v05 f respectively which are in the south and west to ne respectively this phenomenon implies that the version 03 04 and 05 retrievals of imerg all have great uncertainty in estimating precipitation in northern china with high latitudes despite all this when considering all eight indices comprehensively v05 f shows apparent improvement over v03 f and v04 f in eastern china and southern china while v03 f and v04 f have comparable performance with each other while over western regions 03 f and v05 f show overestimation in tp with the β of 1 25 while v04 f exhibits severe underestimation with the β of 0 7 the severe underestimation shown by v04 f over tp is also proved in wei et al 2017 and zhao et al 2017 similar phenomenon can also be found in xj where v04 f exhibits much lower approximately 30 and better much close to 1 β than the other two versions in previous studies v03 f has shown a significant overestimation in tp tang et al 2016a ma et al 2017 so estimation of lower precipitation of v04 f in that areas seems reasonable to some extent fig 5 e however the severe underestimation of v04 f demonstrates that v04 f actually estimate too few precipitation amounts in that regions in xj the good performance of v04 f in terms of β is offset by its extremely bad γ values which makes v04 f the worst precipitation products as the integrated index kge indicates it suggests that v04 f could produce accurate total precipitation amounts but the poor estimates of the distribution of precipitation rates instead v05 f shows the best performance in the complex xj and tp areas indicated by the highest cc kge and csi values nevertheless the performance of all three version products at the hourly scale still has much room to be improved 4 2 2 3 taylor diagrams for evaluation metrics similar to table 3 detailed statistics about the error characteristics of imerg early and late run products over mainland china and eight sub regions are provided in table 4 in addition taylor diagrams taylor 2001 are plotted to graphically summarize how well the seven different precipitation estimates v03 e v03 l v03 f v04 e v04 l v04 f and v05 f match the gauge observations in terms of cc standard deviation and centered rmse fig 8 in the taylor diagrams the uneven angular coordinate is cc represented by blue dash and dot lines and the radical coordinate is standard deviation normalized by the standard deviation value of gauge observation and represented by black dotted lines in addition the green concentric semi circles centered by observation represents centered rmse values the gauge observation is marked by a red star and the closer the marker of precipitation estimates is to the gauge observation the better performance the product has the taylor diagrams suggest that final run of v03 and v04 don t show expected improvements compared with their early and late run algorithms in most areas at the hourly scale over china as for real time precipitation products the late run shows very similar performance to the early run of the same version while v04 early late run has better performance than v03 products in most regions except xj and tp implying that the great uncertainty in v04 f over western china could be sourced into the algorithms of early run as for post real time precipitation products v05 f improves the quality of precipitation estimates over almost all regions compared to v04 f and v03 f in western and northern china it is evident that different precipitation estimates have large variations which may be due to the huge challenge brought by snow and ice and complex terrain in precipitation retrieval 4 2 2 4 spatial differences among the different imerg versions fig 9 displays the spatial distributions of representative evaluation metrics cc β γ kge pod far and csi of imerg v05 f and the differences between v05 f and v03 f and between v04 f and v03 f over mainland china the spatial distribution of v05 f statistics is plotted to represent the performance of imerg products as their similarities the β difference is calculated by measuring the difference between the absolute error of v05 f v04 f and v03 f to 1 0 therefore negative β difference means v05 f v04 f tends to produce more accurate estimates than v03 f the γ difference is calculated through the same way and the other differences are calculated by simply subtracting the indices of v03 f from that of v05 f v04 f as for cc v05 f are in better agreement with gauge data in southern and eastern china with higher cc than other areas which is consistent with previous studies tang et al 2016a chen and li 2016 the cc is much worse in northern and western china with values lower than 0 2 in some areas in addition the kge and csi values of v05 f share very similar distribution patterns with cc the underlying reasons for the low performance over western and northern areas include uneven topography complex climatic and weather conditions posing great challenge to satellite precipitation retrieval dinku et al 2007 tang et al 2018b it should be noted that gauges in such regions are also subject to more severe observation errors such as wind and snowfall induced error measurement which contributes to the uncertainty in evaluation yang et al 2001 adam and lettenmaier 2003 considering the comparisons between new versions and the old one v05 f demonstrates better estimations than v04 f and v03 f across the whole country with higher cc kge and comparable csi in particular v04 f shows worse quality than v03 f in tp indicated by negative differences of cc kge and csi while the latest v05 f gets rid of the retrogressive performance of v04 f and evidently improves the performance in those high altitude and complicated regions the spatial distributions of contingency statistics difference are distinct from that of continuous statistics concerning pod v05 f shows better performance than v03 f in most regions except nc and northern sw while v04 f is much better than v03 f in southeastern china i e cj and se but can t reach the level of v03 f in other regions meanwhile the higher pod of v05 f and v04 f are accompanied by worse far fig 9 q r in those corresponding regions as a consequence the distributions of csi difference exhibit large variability over most parts of cj and se v05 f and v04 f has larger csi than v03 f due to the improvement of pod surpasses the deterioration of far while over most parts of nc and northern sw the csi of v05 f and v04 f is far inferior to that of v03 f caused by poorer pod and far 4 2 2 5 spatial differences within imerg early and late run four imerg near real time estimates v03 e v04 e v03 l and v04 l are also included into spatial analysis at the hourly scale over mainland china fig 10 shows the spatial distributions of metric differences between imerg v03 e and v04 e and between imerg v03 l and v04 l as for imerg early run v04 e is quite different from v03 e firstly v04 e has larger cc over most parts of central and southern china i e nc cj sw and se and xj and the improvement is more significant and widely distributed compared with the final run case in fig 9 c the average cc increases from 0 27 to 0 31 compared v04 e to v03 e across the whole mainland china secondly the performance difference indicated by kge is extremely significant fig 10 b improvements of v04 in kge can be found over ne cj and se but degeneration is apparent over tp xj and central nc thirdly the rmse difference is obviously negative over the western and northern china except central nc where rmse difference is extremely positive and the difference is mostly positive over southern parts finally the csi of v04 e is higher in southern nw central and southern cj and western se but notably lower in ne northern sw and tp compared with that of v03 e the average csi difference is almost zero which could be attributed to the offset between better pod and worse far of v04 e as for imerg late run products shown in fig 10 e h the spatial distribution characteristics of the four indices are almost the same as the early run comparison in general imerg v04 early and late run products are only more effective than v03 over cj and se while over other regions the new versions show similar or even worse performance than the old versions 5 summary and conclusion in this study the newly imerg v05 final run products and its previous versions imerg v03 and v04 are firstly intercompared over the globe at daily temporal resolution also cross evaluated against the globally reanalyzed benchmark gpcp 2 3 and mswep 2 1 with analysis on spatial distributions and latitudinal mean profiles then the early late and final run products of imerg v03 v04 and v05 are carefully evaluated over mainland china against more than 30 000 gauges at hourly and daily temporal resolutions and 0 1 0 1 spatial resolution the conclusions of this study mainly contain 1 imerg v04 f and v05 f products show significant difference and improvements compared to v03 f over ocean according to statistics mean precipitation of v04 f and v05 f increases by 31 36 and 28 81 respectively compared with that of v03 f over ocean in general the significant increase of v04 f and v05 f over ocean is reasonable as the average oceanic precipitation of v04 f and v05 f is 3 10 mm day and 3 04 mm day which is much closer to that of the benchmark gpcp 2 94 mm day and mswep 2 93 mm day than that of v03 f 2 36 mm day the ocean regions with much improved values are northeastern and mid southern pacific ocean northwestern and southwestern atlantic ocean and the equatorial zones however the difference over land is less significant 2 at the national averaged scale over mainland china high cc that is more than 0 9 at the hourly scale and even larger at the daily scale indicates that all imerg versions have the ability to represent the precipitation time series over large regions even though all of them overestimate precipitation values with β of about 1 12 at all resolutions the performance of v03 f v04 f and v05 f are about the same at the national averaged scale 3 at grid based scale v03 f v04 f and v05 f all could basically describe the pdf structure of precipitation over mainland china in particular v04 f and v05 f outperforms v03 f for zero or little precipitation 0 0 4 mm h at the hourly scale while v03 f has better capacity for moderate and heavy precipitation both at hourly 0 4 mm h and daily scales 1 mm day overall imerg v05 f precipitation products generally improves upon its last two predecessors v04 f and v03 f at the hourly scale across the whole country which could demonstrate the advancement of the latest imerg v05 algorithms while v04 f only shows comparable performance with v03 f 4 the quality of v03 v04 and v05 is heterogeneous in different areas of mainland china as a whole the improvement from imerg v03 f to v05 f is more concentrated in southeastern china e g lower reaches of changjiang river and the pearl river and western china e g tp and xj both v04 f and v05 f show worse performance in precipitation occurrence identification in central and northern china than v03 f in addition compared with its processor v03 f v04 f exhibits retrogressive performance in northern and western china which are subject to complex terrain or snow and ice during winter when comparing all seven imerg precipitation products it is evident that v05 f gives a relatively better performance than other estimates in china especially nw ne nc and cj besides v04 real time estimates have better performance in most regions than v03 except xj and tp while the early and late run of the same version generally show similar performance in summary imerg v04 and v05 show significant improvements from their predecessors v03 basically over oceans while over lands represented by mainland china v04 and v03 are about the same level while v05 is identified to be the best performed precipitation estimates in addition there should call on more localized studies to investigate into specific regions with ground gauge radar combined networks as well as reanalysis further investigations should be also carried out to assess the underlying insights from imerg level 2 retrieval algorithms for error and uncertainty and how the uncertainty propagating to the imerg level 3 precipitation products acknowledgements

7073,aiming at resolving the numerical problems caused by the improper friction source term treatment when simulating overland flow using 2d shallow water flow models a proposed implicit method computing the friction source term is developed in this work the method is able to not only accurately evaluate the tricky thin overland flow by considering the flow velocity varying in a single time step but also eliminates the redundant iterations for regular implicit approach through converting the implicit scheme to an explicit equation it is therefore an improved one in terms of accuracy and efficiency comparing to the existing methods furthermore it is an independent part and can be straightforwardly and universally incorporated into any fvm based shallow water flow model such performances are validated against three test cases involving theoretical and practical overland flow problems the results prove the proposed method treating friction source term could simulate overland flow problems in a relatively more accurate and efficient way and therefore can effectively help extend the applicability of the shallow water models reliably computing both the open channel and overland flows keywords overland flow shallow water equations friction source terms implicit scheme rainfall runoff process 1 introduction numerical models for surface water flow including overland and open channel flows play an essential role in solving hydrological hydraulic and environmental problems for example evaluating surface runoff unami et al 2009 costabile et al 2013 simons et al 2014 and flood routine cook et al 2009 huang et al 2013 providing flow field for the contaminant transport and erosion models heng et al 2009 mügler et al 2011 jomaa et al 2013 kim et al 2014 gonzález sanchis et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 traditionally hydrological models or simplified hydrodynamic models lighthill and whitham 1955 govindaraju 1988 are usually used for overland flow simulations at a catchment scale among the commonly used surface water flow models the dynamic wave models based on the saint venant equations or shallow water equations swe are generally considered to be the most physically based one due to their capabilities of computing flow properties in time and space borah 2011 yeh et al 2011 costabile et al 2012 kim et al 2013 xia et al 2017 however some challenges remain for the development of efficient and robust godunov type swes models to the real world overland flow applications because of the complex overland flow patterns over complex domain topography one of the major challenges related to solving the swes for overland flows is the treatment of friction source terms the friction source terms are usually expressed as a non linear function of the flow velocity and depth e g the manning formula one inherent property of the swes with such friction source terms is that the behavior of the equation changes dramatically as the water depth becomes small which is likely to cause numerical problems and is demonstrated herein by analyzing the momentum equation in 1d swes as 1 q t q u 0 5 g h 2 x s s s f where q denotes the unit width discharge t is the time x is the spatial coordinate u is the depth averaged velocity in the x direction h is the water depth g is the gravity acceleration s s and s f are the slope source term and the friction source term which are represented by ghi and c f u u respectively i denotes the bed slope and c f is the roughness coefficient evaluated by c f g n 2 h 1 3 where n is the manning coefficient as plotted in fig 1 for a thin water flow over a slope with the initial water depth h of 0 001 m and the initial unit width discharge of 0 0025 m2 s the updated q at the time level of n 1 will be computed after a small time step using the explicit method because of the thin flow property the scale of the velocities is much large than that of water depth costabile et al 2013 therefore the advection and pressure terms are assumed to be neglected the friction source term and slope source term therefore become dominant due to the scale of squared velocities using the explicit method the flow variables are assumed as those of at the current state when computing those at the next time level within a single time step the friction source term computed may be much higher than that of the slope source term some value even high enough to reverse the flow as shown in table 1 which is reflected by the sign change between the two time levels it is clear that the phenomena will not occur physically the physical process is that if the friction force is lower than total driving force the flow will be accelerated and the friction will subsequently increase until an equilibrium is achieved otherwise the flow will be decelerated to develop a lower velocity and the friction will then decrease until reaching a new equilibrium obviously the cause of the problem is the drastically varying velocity within a time step that cannot be well represented by using explicit approach the similar problem has been addressed by introducing an asymptotic behavior of the swes in the presence of vanishing water depth jin 2012 as the water depth becomes small the relaxation time to the above mentioned equilibrium state may be much smaller than the time step determined by the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition but using a time step bigger than the relaxation time may lead to numerical instability causing the so called stiffness problem xia et al 2017 therefore for accurate and stable simulation of overland flows an swe model must include a proper friction term discretization method to remove the stiffness to resolve this problem an explicit numerical scheme must use very small time steps to maintain numerical stability under such a situation as shown in table 1 a courant number reduced to 0 005 could preserve a relatively reliable result xia et al 2017 also noticed that the local equilibrium between friction and bed slope can be reached much faster than the time step determined by the cfl condition in practical overland flow simulations involving small water depth the use of cfl condition for explicit scheme will therefore lead to prohibitive computational cost another approach as that suggested in liang et al 2009 hou et al 2013a hou et al 2014 is to constrain the friction to evade the flow reversion this approach just assumes the local equilibrium is the flow turning up to be still and therefore is not based on a general case for overland flow several implicit schemes have been developed to cope with the stiff friction source terms and preserve numerical stability e g brufau et al 2004 costanzo and macchione 2006 liang et al 2007 costabile et al 2013 in which θ denotes the implicitness degree of the friction term discretization the implicitness degree may vary according to the flow property to achieve a satisfactory result and impede its application in xia et al 2017 the full implicit method is applied straightly to solve the friction source term in the momentum equation rather than reformulate into an explicit form to ensure the flow velocities relaxed to the correct equilibrium state in a single time step when the friction becomes predominantly large however the iterations integrated in an explicit scheme solving the flux and slope source terms will inevitably increase the computation burden in this paper a new approach is developed based on an implicit concept to deal with the friction source terms of the swes for overland flow simulation it can effectively relax the flow toward the equilibrium state in a single time step and can be easily integrated into a commonly used explicit scheme and therefore is more straightforward for implementation the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the governing equations and the model framework section 3 presents the details of the proposed method for friction source term treatment the behavior of the proposed method asymptotic behavior the flow to the equilibrium state is depicted in section 4 the resulting overland flow model is firstly validated against the analytical tilted v catchment test and then applied to reproduce a flood event at the wangmaogou catchment in section 5 finally brief conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 numerical schemes 2 1 governing equation the shallow water equations swes are derived by assuming the hydrostatic pressure distribution and by depth integrating the equations of conservation of mass and momentum in a vector form a conservation law of the 2d shallow water equations can be written as 2 q t f x g y s 3 q h q x q y f q x u q x g h 2 2 u q y g q y v q x v q y g h 2 2 s s b s f i g h z b x g h z b y i c f u u 2 v 2 c f v u 2 v 2 where t represents the time x and y are the cartesian coordinates t denotes the vector of conserved flow variables consisting of h q x and q y i e the water depth unit width discharges in x and y direction respectively q x u h and q y v h u and v are depth averaged velocities in x and y directions f and g are the flux vectors in x and y directions s is the source vector that may be further subdivided into slope source terms s b and friction source terms s f z b represents the bed elevation c f is the bed roughness coefficient that is generally computed by g n 2 h 1 3 with n being the manning coefficient moreover the water level η h z b is also used in the numerical scheme adopted in this work it should be noted that i is the net rainfall source equal to i r i i where i r is the rainfall rate while i i denotes the infiltration rate in this work the infiltration process is computed by using green ampt model as that in wang et al 2003 ma et al 2010 and cuomo et al 2015 2 2 numerical scheme the numerical model for solving the swes is within the framework of an explicit godunov type cell centered structured finite volume scheme the swes are discretized into algebraic equations by the finite volume method the fluxes of mass and momentum are computed by the hllc approximate riemann solver i e harten lax and van leer approximate riemann solver with contact wave restored the slope source terms are evaluated by the slope flux method as proposed in hou et al 2013b the friction source terms are calculated by the proposed implicit method as presented in this paper the two stage explicit runge kutta approach is applied to update the flow variables to a new time level in the work only the friction source term treatment is in an implicit way while the rest of the terms e g inertia terms pressure terms and the slope source terms are all solved in an explicit way which require a stable condition the stability criterion for the overall finite volume godunov type scheme is the cfl condition which is given as 4 δ t c f l min δ x i u i gh i δ y i v i gh i where δ x i and δ y i are the length and width of a cell respectively cfl denotes the courant number and cfl 0 5 is adopted in this work for all of the simulations 3 friction source term treatment 3 1 1d form of the proposed friction source term treatment to resolve state relaxation time of the friction source term much smaller than the hydrodynamic time step determined by the cfl condition for thin overland flow a new approach is developed based on an implicit concept to deal with the friction source terms of the swes it can effectively relax the flow toward the equilibrium state in a single time step and can be easily integrated into a commonly used explicit scheme since the continuity equation does not involve friction source term the implicit scheme just effectively applies to the momentum equations within an explicit framework the unit width discharge in x direction can be updated to a new time level n 1 as 5 q x n 1 q x n δ q x δ t s f where δ q x f q x n h n δ t s b and f means the flux term computed from hllc riemann solver and sb is the source term both f and sb are computed in a fully explicit way before evaluating the friction source term the above equation can be rewritten into the following form when considering manning friction formula 6 q x n 1 q x n δ q x δ t c f q x 2 h 2 as the friction computation directly depends on the values of the velocities the friction is much more sensitive to the velocity than water depth therefore in the new approach the variable qx related to the velocities is assumed to vary over a time step under consideration while the water depth remains explicit to render the equation solvable algebraically i e the unit width discharge is calculated in an implicit way as 7 q x n 1 q x n δ q x δ t c f q x n 1 h n 2 where c f g n 2 h n 1 3 if the unit width discharge is negative the above equation can be rearranged into 8 q x n 1 q x n δ q x δ t c f q x n 1 h n 2 by far the friction source term in an implicit form has become a quadratic equation with an unknown variable q x n 1 which can be resolved in two cases for the case q x n 1 0 0 eq 6 is rewritten into 9 δ t c f h 2 q x n 1 2 q x n 1 q x n δ q x 0 10 q x n 1 1 1 4 δ t c f h n 2 q x n δ q x 2 δ t c f h n 2 in this case to guarantee the positivity of q x n 1 the right solution to this equation is 11 q x n 1 1 1 4 δ t c f h n 2 q x n δ q x 2 δ t c f h n 2 for the other case with q x n 1 0 0 the eq 6 can be rewritten as 12 δ t c f h 2 q x n 1 2 q x n 1 q x n δ q x 0 resolving the above equation gives 13 q x n 1 1 1 4 δ t c f h n 2 q x n δ q x 2 δ t c f h n 2 in this case as q x n is negative to guarantee the negativity of q x n 1 the right solution turns out to be 14 q x n 1 1 1 4 δ t c f h n 2 q x n δ q x 2 δ t c f h n 2 the positive and negative cases for q x n 1 can be rearranged into a general equation through introducing a sign term as 15 q x n 1 1 1 4 δ t c f h n 2 q x n q x n θ q x n δ q x 2 δ t c f h n 2 q x n q x n θ where θ is adopted to prevent division by zero and θ 1 0 e 12 m 2 s in this work in the proposed friction source term treatment method an implicit concept is applied to ensure the flow solution asymptotic behavior to the equilibrium state the method can be expressed in eq 15 which are obviously in a fully explicit form devised to avoid the redundant iteration process for conventional implicit scheme and can be easily integrated into a commonly used explicit scheme 3 2 2d extension of the proposed friction source term treatment as natural overland flow usually involves 2d problems it is significant to extent the above finding to 2d cases for 2d shallow water equations the friction source terms are nonlinear e g s fx c f u u 2 v 2 or c f q x q x 2 q y 2 h 2 such nonlinear property makes it is out of the question to have analytical solution for the implicit form as eq 9 to preserve the implicit form of the friction source terms and enable the equations solvable in an analytical way the following rearrangement is taken into account as 16 s fx c f q x q x 2 q y 2 h 2 c f q x 2 h 2 q x 2 q y 2 q x 17 s fy c f q y q x 2 q y 2 h 2 c f q y 2 h 2 q x 2 q y 2 q y based on the rearrangement the assumption for linearization is employed in eq 7 through remaining the dimensional term q x 2 q y 2 q x and q x 2 q y 2 q y explicit as 18 q x n 1 q x n δ q x δ t c f q x n 1 h n 2 q x n 2 q y n 2 q x n 19 q y n 1 q y n δ q y δ t c f q y n 1 h n 2 q x n 2 q y n 2 q y n obviously the eqs 18 and 19 are quadratic equations with unknown variables q x n 1 and q y n 1 respectively on the basis of the finding in last subsection the solutions at the new time level can be derived as 20 q x n 1 1 1 4 δ t c f h n 2 q x n 2 q y n 2 q x n θ q x n δ q x 2 δ t c f h n 2 q x n 2 q y n 2 q x n θ 21 q y n 1 1 1 4 δ t c f h n 2 q x n 2 q y n 2 q y n q y n δ q y 2 δ t c f h n 2 q x n 2 q y n 2 q y n θ θ 1 0 e 12 m 2 s is used to avoid dividing by zero obviously for 1d case i e q y 0 m 2 s eq 20 becomes 22 q x n 1 1 1 4 δ t c f h n 2 q x n q x n θ q x n δ q x 2 δ t c f h n 2 q x n q x n θ which is the same as that in eq 15 reflecting the reasonability of the rearrangement it is should be noted that the method of the linearization of 2d friction problem may result in accuracy loss to some extent and in turn affects the simulation accuracy when solving very complex 2d overland flows however as tested in this work the proposed method can reliably compute the common 2d overland flows with friction 4 asymptotic behavior evaluations for friction source term treatment two tests are carried out to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method treating friction source term under a 1d channel with relatively thin water a theoretic test in various overland flow condition with different water depth velocities and slopes is devised to verify the capability of friction source term treatment in this work and categorized by a b c and d as shown in table 2 another test with constant inflow is chosen to verify the computational efficiency 4 1 a theoretic test in various overland flow condition in this benchmark test the process of non uniform overland flow state asymptotic behavior to uniform overland flow state is termed as asymptotic behavior in this work in a computational time step the updated q n 1 should become closer or equal to the unit width equilibrium discharge q e comparing to q n it is therefore lead to δ q computed from eq 23 is 0 m2 s if the numerical scheme is in an asymptotic behavior otherwise a non zero value of δ q will be produced for a method failing to handle the friction source term treatment for thin overland flow 23 δ q q n 1 q n q n 1 q e q e q n the equilibrium discharge q e was calculated as 24 q e h ghs c f in this test case a widely used approach discretizing the friction source terms of the swes developed and applied in brufau et al 2004 costanzo and macchione 2006 liang et al 2010 termed as splitting point implicit method is used as a reference category a focused on the effects of varying water depth on the friction source terms from the computed results the propose approach is able to produce the asymptotic results to an equilibrium flow state reflected by keeps zero for all water depths considered fig 2 a this behavior cannot be maintained by the existing approach as the computed δ q is greater than 0 m2 s when the water depth were below 0 0025 m indicating the existing approach will lead to unrealistic evaluation of the friction source term when the water depth is smaller than certain value category b is mainly concerned with the effects of the computational time step on the friction source terms in this case the courant number is set to be 0 02 which is 1 5 times as smaller as that in the category a aiming at decreasing the side effect of the unrealistic friction the results depict that all of the δ q are equal to 0 m2 s fig 2b indicating that the overland flow with small water depth could be well reproduced for much smaller time step using either the existing or proposed treatment for friction source but the considerably reduced time step will in turn increase the computation time category c is devised to demonstrate the influence of the velocity on thin water flow condition with the value under 0 001 m which is likely to cause computation failure as shown in fig 2a the initial condition for the flow is imposed by a constant water depth of 0 001 m and the velocities of 0 65 0 55 0 45 0 35 0 25 0 15 0 05 m s fig 2c respectively the results show that δ q values are greater than 0 m2 s under different set of velocities with the existing approach indicating it fails to handle the overland flow problem with lower water depth on the contrary the δ q computed by the proposed approach is equal to 0 m2 s under any velocity expressing the numerical solution is in an asymptotic behavior category d is applied herein to analyze the effects of slope gradient on the overland flow simulation when using the selected existing approach the results show that δ q are greater than 0 m2 s on seven slopes fig 2d demonstrating the existing method could not produce reliable simulation for overland flow of thin water depth for the proposed method the performance achieving the equilibrium flow state can be preserved which is illustrated by δ q equal to 0 for all slopes under consideration in a word the existing friction discretization approach usually fails to recover the correct equilibrium flow state within a time step when water depth is small the proposed implicit approach is able to reproduce the right value of friction source in the above mentioned cases involving various water depth velocities bed slopes and computational time step it is therefore an improved one in terms of more properly treating friction source terms in swes in addition the proposed implicit method is the most positive and effective method 4 2 an asymptotic process simulation for evaluating computational efficiency this test case is devised to compare the computational efficiency between the proposed method and the fully implicit one using the criteria suggested in xia et al 2017 when evaluating the friction source term as sketched in fig 1 on a fixed slope given inflow and free outflow conditions are set up at the up and downstream boundaries respectively a set of inflow conditions are defined with the water depth and velocity of 0 1 m and 2 41 m s 0 04 m and 1 37 m s 0 01 m and 0 52 m s respectively the friction calculation efficiency is focused for the asymptotic behavior process i e the flow status varying from non uniform flow to uniform one the friction source term calculation iterates 6 8 times by using the full implicit approach for the asymptotic behavior process compared to the fully implicit approach the proposed method could save 45 16 93 55 computational time for simulating the asymptotic behavior process it should be noted that the iteration time will reduce to 2 when the flow becomes uniform or quasi uniform for the fully implicit approach in this case the high efficiency of the proposed approach is not obvious however it is still relatively superior for easy implementation for coding due to an explicit and straightforward form 5 validation and application two test cases are chosen herein to further validate the overland flow model implemented with the devised implicit friction term discretization approach the first test case focus on rainfall induced overland flows in a theoretic v shaped catchment another test case models a realistic rainfall flood event in wangmaogou catchment china 5 1 overland flow modelling in a v shaped catchment in this test case a v shaped catchment with an approximate analytical solution presented by overton and brakensiek 1973 is applied to validate the model as illustrated in fig 3 the catchment consists of two side slopes and a channel the dimension of the slope is 1000 m long and 800 m wide with a slope of 0 05 the channel is 20 m wide and its bed slope is 0 02 the side wall of the channel is high enough to avoid backwater effects on the valley side the simulation is then conducted for a rainfall event with a constant intensity of 10 8 mm h lasting for 1 5 h manning coefficients are 0 015 s m1 3 and 0 15 s m1 3 for the valley side and the channel respectively such friction condition is assumed to obtain a similar characteristic concentration time in the valley side and in the channel although unrealistic in natural conditions regarding the boundary condition all boundaries are closed boundaries except the outlet where critical flow depth is assumed the domain is initialized as dry land the computational domain is discretized by uniform squared grid with the cell size of 5 m 64 800 cells this test case involves small water depths over slopes and therefore provides an ideal example to demonstrate the performance of friction treatment methods for overland flow the model incorporated with different discretization approaches for the friction source terms e g proposed implicit method splitting point implicit method presented by liang and marche 2009 fully implicit method presented by xia et al 2017 and explicit method is used to reproduce this simple yet challenging test case fig 4 plots the computed hydrographs at the valley sides and channel outlet predicted by the model with four different friction treatments compared with the analytical solutions derived from the kinematic wave assumption di giammarco et al 1994 it is obvious that the splitting point implicit and the explicit methods dealing with the friction source terms fail to produce correct hydrographs at both the hillsides and channel outlet the hydrographs predicted by the model with the proposed implicit and fully implicit friction source term treatments agree closely with the analytical solutions therefore the proposed implicit method is the most positive and effective method the results clearly demonstrate the correct recovery of the asymptotic behavior of the friction terms is essential for reliable simulation of rainfall runoff and overland flow processes 5 2 rainfall runoff modelling in wangmaogou catchment 5 2 1 catchment and data

the area is about 5 9 km2 with the altitude ranging from 934 55 m to 1187 75 m fig 5b a hydrological gauge is located at the channel outlet fig 5b the regional climate is classified as monsoonal with a mean annual temperature and precipitation of 10 2 c and 513 mm respectively more than 60 of the precipitation occurs from july to september xu et al 2017 the numerical model requires digital elevation model dem and land use land cover lulc map to simulate the rainfall runoff processes for a catchment the lulc map of the study area is acquired by digitizing the land use maps 1 100 000 in 2010 fig 5c and is reclassified into nine categories including farmland orchard forest grassland transportation land rural land water bodies terrace and terrace orchard the overall accuracy of land cover classification is about 89 5 and the overall kappa coefficient was 0 86 where kappa coefficient is an index reflecting classification accuracy the dem of the catchment is derived from 1 1000 topographic map fig 5b and then resized to different special resolutions i e 2 m and 5 m two uniform rectangular grids are generated with 2 826 630 and 452 124 cells respectively for the resolution of 2 m and 5 m the hyetograph under consideration is from 0 25 15 07 2012 to 10 25 15 07 2012 as plotted in fig 6 the rainfall and observed stream flow are collected from wangmaogou hydrological gauge two simulations have been performed to reproduce a 10 hour rainfall flood event on the two computational grids 5 2 2 evaluation metrics of the modelling accuracy performance of the model is evaluated through using four metrics relative bias rb nashe sutcliffe efficiency nse root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 rb evaluates the relative distances between observed m and simulated s data with respect to the mean observed value m by 25 rb 100 i 1 n d s i m i n m where n d are the length of data series nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 is a dimensionless goodness of fit indicator ranging from negative infinity to one nse value of 1 indicates a perfect fit between observed and simulated data 26 nse 1 i 1 n d m i s i 2 i 1 n d m i m 2 in the context of catchment hydrologic modeling moriasi et al 2007 summarized that the model performance could be considered as good if the rb is less than 15 for streamflow simulated result could be considered as perfect if its nse equals 1 very good if its nse falls between 0 75 and 1 good if nse falls between 0 65 and 0 75 satisfactory if its nse falls between 0 5 and 0 65 and unsatisfactory if the nse is less than 0 5 moriasi et al 2007 the coefficient of determination r2 reflects the degree of coincidence of the process of simulated and observed runoff the r2 can be calculated from 27 r 2 i 1 n d m m s s 2 i 1 n d m i m 2 i 1 n d s i s 2 the closer the r2 is to 1 the higher the degree of coincidence with the simulated runoff process is obtained 28 rmse i 1 n d m i s i n rmse value of zero indicates perfect fit if the value is less than half of the standard deviation of the observations the model performance is considered as good singh et al 2005 5 2 3 model calibration in the numerical model the sensitive parameters are the infiltration rate and manning coefficient which require suitable values according to the actual catchment therefore the calibration is mainly focused on the two parameters a constant infiltration rate is applied herein as the soil is assumed as saturated due to the previous rainfall the infiltration rate and the manning coefficient are depended on the land use types fig 5d and table 3 and the values are within the range proposed by jiang et al 1986 li et al 2007 and engman 1986 respectively to systematically calibrate the model the values of parameters are set to low median and high within the range shown in table 3 the model is run through using a rainfall runoff event with recorded hydrograph at the catchment outlet nine combinations for the values are applied i e c1 high infiltration and low manning coefficient c2 high infiltration and median manning coefficient c3 high infiltration and high manning coefficient c4 low infiltration and low manning coefficient c5 low infiltration and median manning coefficient c6 low infiltration and high manning coefficient c7 median infiltration and low manning coefficient c8 median infiltration and median manning coefficient and c9 median infiltration and high manning coefficient the suitable parameters are judged depended on the evaluation metrics the observed and simulated discharge process under different parameter combinations are illustrated in fig 7 and table 4 the least absolute value of rb is 1 15 for c2 and followed that is 3 14 for c1 the highest nse and r2 are 0 73 and 0 75 for c1 respectively the lowest root means square error rmse is 0 955 m3 s the threshold values for rb nse r2 and rmse proposed by jiang et al 1986 li et al 2007 and engman 1986 are applied to determine the best performance model with the right parameters as a result the c1 set is the best parameter combination for simulating the catchment flood process nse in table 4 also indicates that the model outputs are very sensitive to the manning coefficient at the same infiltration rate but for different infiltration rates under the same manning coefficient the variation of the simulation results is very tiny with the error between 0 2 and 0 27 except for highest manning coefficient implying the modelling results are more sensitive to the manning coefficient than the infiltration rate 5 2 4 simulation and analysis in order to further verify the numerical model simulating overland flow two kinds of analysis are presented in this section the first one focuses on the effect of friction source term treatments on overland flow simulations while the second one refers to the influence of grid size on model results the predicted time histories of discharge are compared with recorded ones at the outlet of the wangmaogou catchment the proposed implicit approach and fully implicit approach could produce the same results when dealing with the friction sources term regarding the computational accuracy the model incorporated with the proposed implicit approach is compared with the splitting point implicit method and the explicit method fig 8 a plots the modelled and measured discharges on 2 m resolution grid illustrating the shape of the simulated hydrographs peak discharge and peak time agree roughly well with the observed one the quantitative accuracy comparison for different methods are shown in fig 8b and table 5 comparing to the measured peak discharge the simulated one deviates by 0 3 for the proposed implicit while by 1 44 and 2 42 respectively for the splitting point implicit method and the explicit method the peak occurring time for the outflow discharge is delayed by 0 5 h for all three methods in contrast to the observed time and the error is lower than 5 therefore the model with the proposed friction treatment is validated to be able to reliably capture the discharge peak for the whole rainfall runoff process the rmse values and rb values for the proposed implicit splitting point implicit and explicit methods are 0 96 m3 s 1 11 m3 s 1 12 m3 s and 3 14 4 77 3 19 respectively it is obvious that the proposed implicit method is the best solution to deal with the friction source terms in addition the accuracy of the simulated results can also be reflected by r2 and nse fig 8b shows the correlation between the measured and simulated discharge by using the corresponding coefficient of determination the computed r2 are 0 75 0 68 and 0 67 for the proposed implicit method splitting point implicit method and the explicit method respectively demonstrating the proposed implicit method increases the coefficient of determination by 10 29 and 11 94 comparing to the other two methods the computed nse for of the above mentioned three methods are 0 75 0 63 and 0 63 respectively table 5 it is clear that the proposed method could raise the nse by 19 48 to accentuate the effects of the grid resolution on modeled results the model with the above mentioned three methods treating friction source terms are run on 5 m resolution grid under the same hydrological and terrain conditions the computed surface runoff and performance parameters are plotted in fig 8c 8d the computed result agrees worse on the coarse grid than that on the fine grid as shown in fig 8c regarding the peak occurring time for the flow discharge the result on 2 m resolution grid is closer the observed time than that on 5 m resolution grid indicating that the peak delay phenomenon becomes slighter as the gird resolution goes higher it is might because the dem with the higher resolution can reflect more accurate terrain and in turn produce more reliable flood process such phenomenon can also be found by other researchers e g ghaffari 2011 found that a decrease in dem resolution resulted in decreased runoff liang and smith 2015 reported that spatial resolution also had a substantial impact on the flood extent and flood progression was more rapid at higher resolutions furthermore comparing with other two methods the proposed implicit method performs better in terms of accuracy e g the rmse and rb of the computed discharge are 1 24 m3 s 1 44 m3 s 1 72 m3 s and 20 63 21 89 37 17 respectively for the proposed implicit approach splitting point implicit method and the explicit method with respect to the r2 and nse the values are 0 64 0 49 0 43 and 0 54 0 39 0 13 respectively for the three methods comparing to the splitting point implicit method and explicit method the proposed method could increase by 30 61 and 48 83 for coefficient of determination and 38 46 and 315 38 for nse indicating again the proposed implicit approach has the highest accuracy for the 10 h flood event the running time for the simulation using the model with the proposed implicit friction source term treatment is 4 67 h on 2 m resolution grid 2 826 630 cells and 0 43 h on 5 m resolution grid 452 124 cells employing a pc with an intel core i7 4790 3 60 ghz cpu 16 0 gb ram and nvidia geforce gtx 970ti gpu the model with the proposed friction treatment provides an efficient and reliable tool for reproducing the overland flow using shallow water flow model 6 conclusions to overcome the problem for overland flow simulation using 2d shallow water flow model this work developed an implicit method treating friction source term the proposed method is devoted to preserve an asymptotic behavior or to handle the so called stiffness problem based on the finding that the velocity varying may drastically affect the friction evaluation for thin water flows the proposed implicit friction source term treatment has the following key features it is able to simulate the thin overland flow in an accurate way even on realistic complex catchment terrain and therefore can help effectively extend the applicability for shallow water models from water courses to the whole catchment it improves the programming and computational efficiency when evaluating the friction source through transforming the implicit problem solution into an explicit way avoiding the redundant iterations and enabling to use larger computational time steps the two features are essential for accurate stable and efficient simulation of overland flows and floods which usually involves very shallow water flowing downhill the performance of the proposed method incorporated into a 2d godunov type swe model is validated against three test cases involving overland flow with theoretical solutions and measurements by means of comparing with the existing friction source term treatments including splitting point implicit method expressed in liang and marche 2009 fully implicit method presented in xia et al 2017 and explicit method the numerical solutions obtained by using the proposed method agree very well with the theoretical solutions and produce higher accuracy than the splitting point implicit method and the explicit method such behavior has been further demonstrated through simulating a real flood event involving rainfall surface runoff process in the wangmaogou catchment the accuracy of the proposed method is the same as the fully implicit method but the computational efficiency is much higher e g higher than 160 times for all test cases in addition the proposed new friction source term treatment is an independent part of the swe solver it therefore can be flexibly implemented for other finite volume based swe solvers to sum up the proposed method treating friction source term is a relatively more accurate efficient straightforward and universal one for evaluating overland flow problems acknowledgements this work is partly supported by the national key r d program of china no 2016yfc0402404 2016yfc0402704 national natural science

7073,aiming at resolving the numerical problems caused by the improper friction source term treatment when simulating overland flow using 2d shallow water flow models a proposed implicit method computing the friction source term is developed in this work the method is able to not only accurately evaluate the tricky thin overland flow by considering the flow velocity varying in a single time step but also eliminates the redundant iterations for regular implicit approach through converting the implicit scheme to an explicit equation it is therefore an improved one in terms of accuracy and efficiency comparing to the existing methods furthermore it is an independent part and can be straightforwardly and universally incorporated into any fvm based shallow water flow model such performances are validated against three test cases involving theoretical and practical overland flow problems the results prove the proposed method treating friction source term could simulate overland flow problems in a relatively more accurate and efficient way and therefore can effectively help extend the applicability of the shallow water models reliably computing both the open channel and overland flows keywords overland flow shallow water equations friction source terms implicit scheme rainfall runoff process 1 introduction numerical models for surface water flow including overland and open channel flows play an essential role in solving hydrological hydraulic and environmental problems for example evaluating surface runoff unami et al 2009 costabile et al 2013 simons et al 2014 and flood routine cook et al 2009 huang et al 2013 providing flow field for the contaminant transport and erosion models heng et al 2009 mügler et al 2011 jomaa et al 2013 kim et al 2014 gonzález sanchis et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 traditionally hydrological models or simplified hydrodynamic models lighthill and whitham 1955 govindaraju 1988 are usually used for overland flow simulations at a catchment scale among the commonly used surface water flow models the dynamic wave models based on the saint venant equations or shallow water equations swe are generally considered to be the most physically based one due to their capabilities of computing flow properties in time and space borah 2011 yeh et al 2011 costabile et al 2012 kim et al 2013 xia et al 2017 however some challenges remain for the development of efficient and robust godunov type swes models to the real world overland flow applications because of the complex overland flow patterns over complex domain topography one of the major challenges related to solving the swes for overland flows is the treatment of friction source terms the friction source terms are usually expressed as a non linear function of the flow velocity and depth e g the manning formula one inherent property of the swes with such friction source terms is that the behavior of the equation changes dramatically as the water depth becomes small which is likely to cause numerical problems and is demonstrated herein by analyzing the momentum equation in 1d swes as 1 q t q u 0 5 g h 2 x s s s f where q denotes the unit width discharge t is the time x is the spatial coordinate u is the depth averaged velocity in the x direction h is the water depth g is the gravity acceleration s s and s f are the slope source term and the friction source term which are represented by ghi and c f u u respectively i denotes the bed slope and c f is the roughness coefficient evaluated by c f g n 2 h 1 3 where n is the manning coefficient as plotted in fig 1 for a thin water flow over a slope with the initial water depth h of 0 001 m and the initial unit width discharge of 0 0025 m2 s the updated q at the time level of n 1 will be computed after a small time step using the explicit method because of the thin flow property the scale of the velocities is much large than that of water depth costabile et al 2013 therefore the advection and pressure terms are assumed to be neglected the friction source term and slope source term therefore become dominant due to the scale of squared velocities using the explicit method the flow variables are assumed as those of at the current state when computing those at the next time level within a single time step the friction source term computed may be much higher than that of the slope source term some value even high enough to reverse the flow as shown in table 1 which is reflected by the sign change between the two time levels it is clear that the phenomena will not occur physically the physical process is that if the friction force is lower than total driving force the flow will be accelerated and the friction will subsequently increase until an equilibrium is achieved otherwise the flow will be decelerated to develop a lower velocity and the friction will then decrease until reaching a new equilibrium obviously the cause of the problem is the drastically varying velocity within a time step that cannot be well represented by using explicit approach the similar problem has been addressed by introducing an asymptotic behavior of the swes in the presence of vanishing water depth jin 2012 as the water depth becomes small the relaxation time to the above mentioned equilibrium state may be much smaller than the time step determined by the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition but using a time step bigger than the relaxation time may lead to numerical instability causing the so called stiffness problem xia et al 2017 therefore for accurate and stable simulation of overland flows an swe model must include a proper friction term discretization method to remove the stiffness to resolve this problem an explicit numerical scheme must use very small time steps to maintain numerical stability under such a situation as shown in table 1 a courant number reduced to 0 005 could preserve a relatively reliable result xia et al 2017 also noticed that the local equilibrium between friction and bed slope can be reached much faster than the time step determined by the cfl condition in practical overland flow simulations involving small water depth the use of cfl condition for explicit scheme will therefore lead to prohibitive computational cost another approach as that suggested in liang et al 2009 hou et al 2013a hou et al 2014 is to constrain the friction to evade the flow reversion this approach just assumes the local equilibrium is the flow turning up to be still and therefore is not based on a general case for overland flow several implicit schemes have been developed to cope with the stiff friction source terms and preserve numerical stability e g brufau et al 2004 costanzo and macchione 2006 liang et al 2007 costabile et al 2013 in which θ denotes the implicitness degree of the friction term discretization the implicitness degree may vary according to the flow property to achieve a satisfactory result and impede its application in xia et al 2017 the full implicit method is applied straightly to solve the friction source term in the momentum equation rather than reformulate into an explicit form to ensure the flow velocities relaxed to the correct equilibrium state in a single time step when the friction becomes predominantly large however the iterations integrated in an explicit scheme solving the flux and slope source terms will inevitably increase the computation burden in this paper a new approach is developed based on an implicit concept to deal with the friction source terms of the swes for overland flow simulation it can effectively relax the flow toward the equilibrium state in a single time step and can be easily integrated into a commonly used explicit scheme and therefore is more straightforward for implementation the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the governing equations and the model framework section 3 presents the details of the proposed method for friction source term treatment the behavior of the proposed method asymptotic behavior the flow to the equilibrium state is depicted in section 4 the resulting overland flow model is firstly validated against the analytical tilted v catchment test and then applied to reproduce a flood event at the wangmaogou catchment in section 5 finally brief conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 numerical schemes 2 1 governing equation the shallow water equations swes are derived by assuming the hydrostatic pressure distribution and by depth integrating the equations of conservation of mass and momentum in a vector form a conservation law of the 2d shallow water equations can be written as 2 q t f x g y s 3 q h q x q y f q x u q x g h 2 2 u q y g q y v q x v q y g h 2 2 s s b s f i g h z b x g h z b y i c f u u 2 v 2 c f v u 2 v 2 where t represents the time x and y are the cartesian coordinates t denotes the vector of conserved flow variables consisting of h q x and q y i e the water depth unit width discharges in x and y direction respectively q x u h and q y v h u and v are depth averaged velocities in x and y directions f and g are the flux vectors in x and y directions s is the source vector that may be further subdivided into slope source terms s b and friction source terms s f z b represents the bed elevation c f is the bed roughness coefficient that is generally computed by g n 2 h 1 3 with n being the manning coefficient moreover the water level η h z b is also used in the numerical scheme adopted in this work it should be noted that i is the net rainfall source equal to i r i i where i r is the rainfall rate while i i denotes the infiltration rate in this work the infiltration process is computed by using green ampt model as that in wang et al 2003 ma et al 2010 and cuomo et al 2015 2 2 numerical scheme the numerical model for solving the swes is within the framework of an explicit godunov type cell centered structured finite volume scheme the swes are discretized into algebraic equations by the finite volume method the fluxes of mass and momentum are computed by the hllc approximate riemann solver i e harten lax and van leer approximate riemann solver with contact wave restored the slope source terms are evaluated by the slope flux method as proposed in hou et al 2013b the friction source terms are calculated by the proposed implicit method as presented in this paper the two stage explicit runge kutta approach is applied to update the flow variables to a new time level in the work only the friction source term treatment is in an implicit way while the rest of the terms e g inertia terms pressure terms and the slope source terms are all solved in an explicit way which require a stable condition the stability criterion for the overall finite volume godunov type scheme is the cfl condition which is given as 4 δ t c f l min δ x i u i gh i δ y i v i gh i where δ x i and δ y i are the length and width of a cell respectively cfl denotes the courant number and cfl 0 5 is adopted in this work for all of the simulations 3 friction source term treatment 3 1 1d form of the proposed friction source term treatment to resolve state relaxation time of the friction source term much smaller than the hydrodynamic time step determined by the cfl condition for thin overland flow a new approach is developed based on an implicit concept to deal with the friction source terms of the swes it can effectively relax the flow toward the equilibrium state in a single time step and can be easily integrated into a commonly used explicit scheme since the continuity equation does not involve friction source term the implicit scheme just effectively applies to the momentum equations within an explicit framework the unit width discharge in x direction can be updated to a new time level n 1 as 5 q x n 1 q x n δ q x δ t s f where δ q x f q x n h n δ t s b and f means the flux term computed from hllc riemann solver and sb is the source term both f and sb are computed in a fully explicit way before evaluating the friction source term the above equation can be rewritten into the following form when considering manning friction formula 6 q x n 1 q x n δ q x δ t c f q x 2 h 2 as the friction computation directly depends on the values of the velocities the friction is much more sensitive to the velocity than water depth therefore in the new approach the variable qx related to the velocities is assumed to vary over a time step under consideration while the water depth remains explicit to render the equation solvable algebraically i e the unit width discharge is calculated in an implicit way as 7 q x n 1 q x n δ q x δ t c f q x n 1 h n 2 where c f g n 2 h n 1 3 if the unit width discharge is negative the above equation can be rearranged into 8 q x n 1 q x n δ q x δ t c f q x n 1 h n 2 by far the friction source term in an implicit form has become a quadratic equation with an unknown variable q x n 1 which can be resolved in two cases for the case q x n 1 0 0 eq 6 is rewritten into 9 δ t c f h 2 q x n 1 2 q x n 1 q x n δ q x 0 10 q x n 1 1 1 4 δ t c f h n 2 q x n δ q x 2 δ t c f h n 2 in this case to guarantee the positivity of q x n 1 the right solution to this equation is 11 q x n 1 1 1 4 δ t c f h n 2 q x n δ q x 2 δ t c f h n 2 for the other case with q x n 1 0 0 the eq 6 can be rewritten as 12 δ t c f h 2 q x n 1 2 q x n 1 q x n δ q x 0 resolving the above equation gives 13 q x n 1 1 1 4 δ t c f h n 2 q x n δ q x 2 δ t c f h n 2 in this case as q x n is negative to guarantee the negativity of q x n 1 the right solution turns out to be 14 q x n 1 1 1 4 δ t c f h n 2 q x n δ q x 2 δ t c f h n 2 the positive and negative cases for q x n 1 can be rearranged into a general equation through introducing a sign term as 15 q x n 1 1 1 4 δ t c f h n 2 q x n q x n θ q x n δ q x 2 δ t c f h n 2 q x n q x n θ where θ is adopted to prevent division by zero and θ 1 0 e 12 m 2 s in this work in the proposed friction source term treatment method an implicit concept is applied to ensure the flow solution asymptotic behavior to the equilibrium state the method can be expressed in eq 15 which are obviously in a fully explicit form devised to avoid the redundant iteration process for conventional implicit scheme and can be easily integrated into a commonly used explicit scheme 3 2 2d extension of the proposed friction source term treatment as natural overland flow usually involves 2d problems it is significant to extent the above finding to 2d cases for 2d shallow water equations the friction source terms are nonlinear e g s fx c f u u 2 v 2 or c f q x q x 2 q y 2 h 2 such nonlinear property makes it is out of the question to have analytical solution for the implicit form as eq 9 to preserve the implicit form of the friction source terms and enable the equations solvable in an analytical way the following rearrangement is taken into account as 16 s fx c f q x q x 2 q y 2 h 2 c f q x 2 h 2 q x 2 q y 2 q x 17 s fy c f q y q x 2 q y 2 h 2 c f q y 2 h 2 q x 2 q y 2 q y based on the rearrangement the assumption for linearization is employed in eq 7 through remaining the dimensional term q x 2 q y 2 q x and q x 2 q y 2 q y explicit as 18 q x n 1 q x n δ q x δ t c f q x n 1 h n 2 q x n 2 q y n 2 q x n 19 q y n 1 q y n δ q y δ t c f q y n 1 h n 2 q x n 2 q y n 2 q y n obviously the eqs 18 and 19 are quadratic equations with unknown variables q x n 1 and q y n 1 respectively on the basis of the finding in last subsection the solutions at the new time level can be derived as 20 q x n 1 1 1 4 δ t c f h n 2 q x n 2 q y n 2 q x n θ q x n δ q x 2 δ t c f h n 2 q x n 2 q y n 2 q x n θ 21 q y n 1 1 1 4 δ t c f h n 2 q x n 2 q y n 2 q y n q y n δ q y 2 δ t c f h n 2 q x n 2 q y n 2 q y n θ θ 1 0 e 12 m 2 s is used to avoid dividing by zero obviously for 1d case i e q y 0 m 2 s eq 20 becomes 22 q x n 1 1 1 4 δ t c f h n 2 q x n q x n θ q x n δ q x 2 δ t c f h n 2 q x n q x n θ which is the same as that in eq 15 reflecting the reasonability of the rearrangement it is should be noted that the method of the linearization of 2d friction problem may result in accuracy loss to some extent and in turn affects the simulation accuracy when solving very complex 2d overland flows however as tested in this work the proposed method can reliably compute the common 2d overland flows with friction 4 asymptotic behavior evaluations for friction source term treatment two tests are carried out to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method treating friction source term under a 1d channel with relatively thin water a theoretic test in various overland flow condition with different water depth velocities and slopes is devised to verify the capability of friction source term treatment in this work and categorized by a b c and d as shown in table 2 another test with constant inflow is chosen to verify the computational efficiency 4 1 a theoretic test in various overland flow condition in this benchmark test the process of non uniform overland flow state asymptotic behavior to uniform overland flow state is termed as asymptotic behavior in this work in a computational time step the updated q n 1 should become closer or equal to the unit width equilibrium discharge q e comparing to q n it is therefore lead to δ q computed from eq 23 is 0 m2 s if the numerical scheme is in an asymptotic behavior otherwise a non zero value of δ q will be produced for a method failing to handle the friction source term treatment for thin overland flow 23 δ q q n 1 q n q n 1 q e q e q n the equilibrium discharge q e was calculated as 24 q e h ghs c f in this test case a widely used approach discretizing the friction source terms of the swes developed and applied in brufau et al 2004 costanzo and macchione 2006 liang et al 2010 termed as splitting point implicit method is used as a reference category a focused on the effects of varying water depth on the friction source terms from the computed results the propose approach is able to produce the asymptotic results to an equilibrium flow state reflected by keeps zero for all water depths considered fig 2 a this behavior cannot be maintained by the existing approach as the computed δ q is greater than 0 m2 s when the water depth were below 0 0025 m indicating the existing approach will lead to unrealistic evaluation of the friction source term when the water depth is smaller than certain value category b is mainly concerned with the effects of the computational time step on the friction source terms in this case the courant number is set to be 0 02 which is 1 5 times as smaller as that in the category a aiming at decreasing the side effect of the unrealistic friction the results depict that all of the δ q are equal to 0 m2 s fig 2b indicating that the overland flow with small water depth could be well reproduced for much smaller time step using either the existing or proposed treatment for friction source but the considerably reduced time step will in turn increase the computation time category c is devised to demonstrate the influence of the velocity on thin water flow condition with the value under 0 001 m which is likely to cause computation failure as shown in fig 2a the initial condition for the flow is imposed by a constant water depth of 0 001 m and the velocities of 0 65 0 55 0 45 0 35 0 25 0 15 0 05 m s fig 2c respectively the results show that δ q values are greater than 0 m2 s under different set of velocities with the existing approach indicating it fails to handle the overland flow problem with lower water depth on the contrary the δ q computed by the proposed approach is equal to 0 m2 s under any velocity expressing the numerical solution is in an asymptotic behavior category d is applied herein to analyze the effects of slope gradient on the overland flow simulation when using the selected existing approach the results show that δ q are greater than 0 m2 s on seven slopes fig 2d demonstrating the existing method could not produce reliable simulation for overland flow of thin water depth for the proposed method the performance achieving the equilibrium flow state can be preserved which is illustrated by δ q equal to 0 for all slopes under consideration in a word the existing friction discretization approach usually fails to recover the correct equilibrium flow state within a time step when water depth is small the proposed implicit approach is able to reproduce the right value of friction source in the above mentioned cases involving various water depth velocities bed slopes and computational time step it is therefore an improved one in terms of more properly treating friction source terms in swes in addition the proposed implicit method is the most positive and effective method 4 2 an asymptotic process simulation for evaluating computational efficiency this test case is devised to compare the computational efficiency between the proposed method and the fully implicit one using the criteria suggested in xia et al 2017 when evaluating the friction source term as sketched in fig 1 on a fixed slope given inflow and free outflow conditions are set up at the up and downstream boundaries respectively a set of inflow conditions are defined with the water depth and velocity of 0 1 m and 2 41 m s 0 04 m and 1 37 m s 0 01 m and 0 52 m s respectively the friction calculation efficiency is focused for the asymptotic behavior process i e the flow status varying from non uniform flow to uniform one the friction source term calculation iterates 6 8 times by using the full implicit approach for the asymptotic behavior process compared to the fully implicit approach the proposed method could save 45 16 93 55 computational time for simulating the asymptotic behavior process it should be noted that the iteration time will reduce to 2 when the flow becomes uniform or quasi uniform for the fully implicit approach in this case the high efficiency of the proposed approach is not obvious however it is still relatively superior for easy implementation for coding due to an explicit and straightforward form 5 validation and application two test cases are chosen herein to further validate the overland flow model implemented with the devised implicit friction term discretization approach the first test case focus on rainfall induced overland flows in a theoretic v shaped catchment another test case models a realistic rainfall flood event in wangmaogou catchment china 5 1 overland flow modelling in a v shaped catchment in this test case a v shaped catchment with an approximate analytical solution presented by overton and brakensiek 1973 is applied to validate the model as illustrated in fig 3 the catchment consists of two side slopes and a channel the dimension of the slope is 1000 m long and 800 m wide with a slope of 0 05 the channel is 20 m wide and its bed slope is 0 02 the side wall of the channel is high enough to avoid backwater effects on the valley side the simulation is then conducted for a rainfall event with a constant intensity of 10 8 mm h lasting for 1 5 h manning coefficients are 0 015 s m1 3 and 0 15 s m1 3 for the valley side and the channel respectively such friction condition is assumed to obtain a similar characteristic concentration time in the valley side and in the channel although unrealistic in natural conditions regarding the boundary condition all boundaries are closed boundaries except the outlet where critical flow depth is assumed the domain is initialized as dry land the computational domain is discretized by uniform squared grid with the cell size of 5 m 64 800 cells this test case involves small water depths over slopes and therefore provides an ideal example to demonstrate the performance of friction treatment methods for overland flow the model incorporated with different discretization approaches for the friction source terms e g proposed implicit method splitting point implicit method presented by liang and marche 2009 fully implicit method presented by xia et al 2017 and explicit method is used to reproduce this simple yet challenging test case fig 4 plots the computed hydrographs at the valley sides and channel outlet predicted by the model with four different friction treatments compared with the analytical solutions derived from the kinematic wave assumption di giammarco et al 1994 it is obvious that the splitting point implicit and the explicit methods dealing with the friction source terms fail to produce correct hydrographs at both the hillsides and channel outlet the hydrographs predicted by the model with the proposed implicit and fully implicit friction source term treatments agree closely with the analytical solutions therefore the proposed implicit method is the most positive and effective method the results clearly demonstrate the correct recovery of the asymptotic behavior of the friction terms is essential for reliable simulation of rainfall runoff and overland flow processes 5 2 rainfall runoff modelling in wangmaogou catchment 5 2 1 catchment and data introduction the model is applied at wangmaogou catchment which is a small semiarid loessal catchment 10 20 26 110 22 46 e 37 34 13 37 36 03 n located in suide county shaanxi province china fig 5 a the area is about 5 9 km2 with the altitude ranging from 934 55 m to 1187 75 m fig 5b a hydrological gauge is located at the channel outlet fig 5b the regional climate is classified as monsoonal with a mean annual temperature and precipitation of 10 2 c and 513 mm respectively more than 60 of the precipitation occurs from july to september xu et al 2017 the numerical model requires digital elevation model dem and land use land cover lulc map to simulate the rainfall runoff processes for a catchment the lulc map of the study area is acquired by digitizing the land use maps 1 100 000 in 2010 fig 5c and is reclassified into nine categories including farmland orchard forest grassland transportation land rural land water bodies terrace and terrace orchard the overall accuracy of land cover classification is about 89 5 and the overall kappa coefficient was 0 86 where kappa coefficient is an index reflecting classification accuracy the dem of the catchment is derived from 1 1000 topographic map fig 5b and then resized to different special resolutions i e 2 m and 5 m two uniform rectangular grids are generated with 2 826 630 and 452 124 cells respectively for the resolution of 2 m and 5 m the hyetograph under consideration is from 0 25 15 07 2012 to 10 25 15 07 2012 as plotted in fig 6 the rainfall and observed stream flow are collected from wangmaogou hydrological gauge two simulations have been performed to reproduce a 10 hour rainfall flood event on the two computational grids 5 2 2 evaluation metrics of the modelling accuracy performance of the model is evaluated through using four metrics relative bias rb nashe sutcliffe efficiency nse root mean square error rmse and coefficient of determination r2 rb evaluates the relative distances between observed m and simulated s data with respect to the mean observed value m by 25 rb 100 i 1 n d s i m i n m where n d are the length of data series nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 is a dimensionless goodness of fit indicator ranging from negative infinity to one nse value of 1 indicates a perfect fit between observed and simulated data 26 nse 1 i 1 n d m i s i 2 i 1 n d m i m 2 in the context of catchment hydrologic modeling moriasi et al 2007 summarized that the model performance could be considered as good if the rb is less than 15 for streamflow simulated result could be considered as perfect if its nse equals 1 very good if its nse falls between 0 75 and 1 good if nse falls between 0 65 and 0 75 satisfactory if its nse falls between 0 5 and 0 65 and unsatisfactory if the nse is less than 0 5 moriasi et al 2007 the coefficient of determination r2 reflects the degree of coincidence of the process of simulated and observed runoff the r2 can be calculated from 27 r 2 i 1 n d m m s s 2 i 1 n d m i m 2 i 1 n d s i s 2 the closer the r2 is to 1 the higher the degree of coincidence with the simulated runoff process is obtained 28 rmse i 1 n d m i s i n rmse value of zero indicates perfect fit if the value is less than half of the standard deviation of the observations the model performance is considered as good singh et al 2005 5 2 3 model calibration in the numerical model the sensitive parameters are the infiltration rate and manning coefficient which require suitable values according to the actual catchment therefore the calibration is mainly focused on the two parameters a constant infiltration rate is applied herein as the soil is assumed as saturated due to the previous rainfall the infiltration rate and the manning coefficient are depended on the land use types fig 5d and table 3 and the values are within the range proposed by jiang et al 1986 li et al 2007 and engman 1986 respectively to systematically calibrate the model the values of parameters are set to low median and high within the range shown in table 3 the model is run through using a rainfall runoff event with recorded hydrograph at the catchment outlet nine combinations for the values are applied i e c1 high infiltration and low manning coefficient c2 high infiltration and median manning coefficient c3 high infiltration and high manning coefficient c4 low infiltration and low manning coefficient c5 low infiltration and median manning coefficient c6 low infiltration and high manning coefficient c7 median infiltration and low manning coefficient c8 median infiltration and median manning coefficient and c9 median infiltration and high manning coefficient the suitable parameters are judged depended on the evaluation metrics the observed and simulated discharge process under different parameter combinations are illustrated in fig 7 and table 4 the least absolute value of rb is 1 15 for c2 and followed that is 3 14 for c1 the highest nse and r2 are 0 73 and 0 75 for c1 respectively the lowest root means square error rmse is 0 955 m3 s the threshold values for rb nse r2 and rmse proposed by jiang et al 1986 li et al 2007 and engman 1986 are applied to determine the best performance model with the right parameters as a result the c1 set is the best parameter combination for simulating the catchment flood process nse in table 4 also indicates that the model outputs are very sensitive to the manning coefficient at the same infiltration rate but for different infiltration rates under the same manning coefficient the variation of the simulation results is very tiny with the error between 0 2 and 0 27 except for highest manning coefficient implying the modelling results are more sensitive to the manning coefficient than the infiltration rate 5 2 4 simulation and analysis in order to further verify the numerical model simulating overland flow two kinds of analysis are presented in this section the first one focuses on the effect of friction source term treatments on overland flow simulations while the second one refers to the influence of grid size on model results the predicted time histories of discharge are compared with recorded ones at the outlet of the wangmaogou catchment the proposed implicit approach and fully implicit approach could produce the same results when dealing with the friction sources term regarding the computational accuracy the model incorporated with the proposed implicit approach is compared with the splitting point implicit method and the explicit method fig 8 a plots the modelled and measured discharges on 2 m resolution grid illustrating the shape of the simulated hydrographs peak discharge and peak time agree roughly well with the observed one the quantitative accuracy comparison for different methods are shown in fig 8b and table 5 comparing to the measured peak discharge the simulated one deviates by 0 3 for the proposed implicit while by 1 44 and 2 42 respectively for the splitting point implicit method and the explicit method the peak occurring time for the outflow discharge is delayed by 0 5 h for all three methods in contrast to the observed time and the error is lower than 5 therefore the model with the proposed friction treatment is validated to be able to reliably capture the discharge peak for the whole rainfall runoff process the rmse values and rb values for the proposed implicit splitting point implicit and explicit methods are 0 96 m3 s 1 11 m3 s 1 12 m3 s and 3 14 4 77 3 19 respectively it is obvious that the proposed implicit method is the best solution to deal with the friction source terms in addition the accuracy of the simulated results can also be reflected by r2 and nse fig 8b shows the correlation between the measured and simulated discharge by using the corresponding coefficient of determination the computed r2 are 0 75 0 68 and 0 67 for the proposed implicit method splitting point implicit method and the explicit method respectively demonstrating the proposed implicit method increases the coefficient of determination by 10 29 and 11 94 comparing to the other two methods the computed nse for of the above mentioned three methods are 0 75 0 63 and 0 63 respectively table 5 it is clear that the proposed method could raise the nse by 19 48 to accentuate the effects of the grid resolution on modeled results the model with the above mentioned three methods treating friction source terms are run on 5 m resolution grid under the same hydrological and terrain conditions the computed surface runoff and performance parameters are plotted in fig 8c 8d the computed result agrees worse on the coarse grid than that on the fine grid as shown in fig 8c regarding the peak occurring time for the flow discharge the result on 2 m resolution grid is closer the observed time than that on 5 m resolution grid indicating that the peak delay phenomenon becomes slighter as the gird resolution goes higher it is might because the dem with the higher resolution can reflect more accurate terrain and in turn produce more reliable flood process such phenomenon can also be found by other researchers e g ghaffari 2011 found that a decrease in dem resolution resulted in decreased runoff liang and smith 2015 reported that spatial resolution also had a substantial impact on the flood extent and flood progression was more rapid at higher resolutions furthermore comparing with other two methods the proposed implicit method performs better in terms of accuracy e g the rmse and rb of the computed discharge are 1 24 m3 s 1 44 m3 s 1 72 m3 s and 20 63 21 89 37 17 respectively for the proposed implicit approach splitting point implicit method and the explicit method with respect to the r2 and nse the values are 0 64 0 49 0 43 and 0 54 0 39 0 13 respectively for the three methods comparing to the splitting point implicit method and explicit method the proposed method could increase by 30 61 and 48 83 for coefficient of determination and 38 46 and 315 38 for nse indicating again the proposed implicit approach has the highest accuracy for the 10 h flood event the running time for the simulation using the model with the proposed implicit friction source term treatment is 4 67 h on 2 m resolution grid 2 826 630 cells and 0 43 h on 5 m resolution grid 452 124 cells employing a pc with an intel core i7 4790 3 60 ghz cpu 16 0 gb ram and nvidia geforce gtx 970ti gpu the model with the proposed friction treatment provides an efficient and reliable tool for reproducing the overland flow using shallow water flow model 6 conclusions to overcome the problem for overland flow simulation using 2d shallow water flow model this work developed an implicit method treating friction source term the proposed method is devoted to preserve an asymptotic behavior or to handle the so called stiffness problem based on the finding that the velocity varying may drastically affect the friction evaluation for thin water flows the proposed implicit friction source term treatment has the following key features it is able to simulate the thin overland flow in an accurate way even on realistic complex catchment terrain and therefore can help effectively extend the applicability for shallow water models from water courses to the whole catchment it improves the programming and computational efficiency when evaluating the friction source through transforming the implicit problem solution into an explicit way avoiding the redundant iterations and enabling to use larger computational time steps the two features are essential for accurate stable and efficient simulation of overland flows and floods which usually involves very shallow water flowing downhill the performance of the proposed method incorporated into a 2d godunov type swe model is validated against three test cases involving overland flow with theoretical solutions and measurements by means of comparing with the existing friction source term treatments including splitting point implicit method expressed in liang and marche 2009 fully implicit method presented in xia et al 2017 and explicit method the numerical solutions obtained by using the proposed method agree very well with the theoretical solutions and produce higher accuracy than the splitting point implicit method and the explicit method such behavior has been further demonstrated through simulating a real flood event involving rainfall surface runoff process in the wangmaogou catchment the accuracy of the proposed method is the same as the fully implicit method but the computational efficiency is much higher e g higher than 160 times for all test cases in addition the proposed new friction source term treatment is an independent part of the swe solver it therefore can be flexibly implemented for other finite volume based swe solvers to sum up the proposed method treating friction source term is a relatively more accurate efficient straightforward and universal one for evaluating overland flow problems acknowledgements this work is partly supported by the national key r d program of china no 2016yfc0402404 2016yfc0402704 national natural science

7074,the permanent wilting point pwp is the minimal point of soil moisture a plant requires not to wilt if moisture decreases to this or any lower point a plant wilts and can no longer recover its turgidity when placed in a saturated atmosphere for 12 h the pwp is an essential physical property that has a powerful influence on other soil properties and is important for agricultural production including irrigation water use efficiency and crop yield however there are few published datasets on the pwp of cultivated land in the arid and semi arid regions of northeast china direct measurements of pwp are time consuming and expensive therefore the aim of this study was to evaluate how environmental variables could be used in spatial predictions of pwp in an arid and semi arid region based on boosted regression tree brt and multiple linear stepwise regression mlsr analyses seventy soil samples and nine covariates including topography and vegetation variables were collected and analyzed cross validation procedure was used to evaluate model performance and uncertainty accuracy evaluation results showed that the brt model had better predictive performance than the mlsr pwp content decreased from the southwest to the northeast of the study area and average values of both models were 26 brt and mlsr models should be compared and calibrated to obtain the best prediction effect of pwp spatial distribution in similar areas elevation slope gradient profile curvature topographic wetness index and land use variables are the main environmental indicators that should be included when generating pwp maps of regions with a dry continental climate such information could aid local land managers and government agencies with evaluating soil quality and water sequestration potential in conclusion this study could be used as a reference for predicting the hydrological parameters of the topsoil in other similar ecological environments keywords digital soil mapping dsm boosted regression tree brt multiple linear stepwise regression mlsr 1 introduction the permanent wilting point pwp is the minimal point of soil moisture a plant requires not to wilt if moisture decreases to this or any lower point a plant wilts and can no longer recover its turgidity when placed in a saturated atmosphere for 12 h it is an important hydraulic property of the soil and has been widely used to calculate the water depth required for irrigation asgarzadeh et al 2011 groenevelt et al 2001 kirkham 2005 minasny and mcbratney 2003 and to determine water availability the information is important for assessing the suitability of a land area for producing a given crop hosseini et al 2016 in small or homogeneous areas only a few samples are required provide to accurate estimates of pwp givi et al 2004 however it is virtually impossible to determine the spatial variability of pwp in large areas when time and funds are limited therefore economical and rapid ways to estimate soil properties are needed mcbratney et al 2003 digital soil mapping dsm methods provide a low cost and rapid way to estimate pwp over large areas using few samples and environmental covariates mulder et al 2011 several previous studies have established relationships between different soil properties and various environmental variables including soil carbon storage stevens et al 2008 wang et al 2017 and particle size composition da silva chagas et al 2016 demattê et al 2007 however few studies estimated soil moisture content the most commonly used methods for predicting soil properties are multiple linear stepwise regression mlsr hong et al 2013 nanni and demattê 2006 linear mixed models rab et al 2011 geostatistical and hybrid methods poggio et al 2010 rab et al 2011 partial least squares regression gomez et al 2008 stevens et al 2008 genetic programming padarian et al 2014 parasuraman et al 2007 hierarchical spatial regression gooley et al 2014 support vector machines padarian et al 2014 and random forest models lopatin et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 despite various dsm methods being available selecting an optimum model to predict soil hydrological properties is not always straightforward boosted regression tree brt is a tree based model barthold et al 2008 ciampalini et al 2014a b martin et al 2011 peters et al 2008 that has rarely been used to model spatial variation in pwp brt combines many simple trees to improve predictive performance and robustness in comparison with single tree models that are based on traditional regression trees friedman and meulman 2003 skurichina and duin 2002 the fitted brt model is a linear combination of many simple trees and the results of several competing models that have merged jafari et al 2014 as a data mining method the brt model increases predictive performance by reducing over learning or over fitting the brt model provides information to evaluate summarize and interpret the fitted model and can incorporate different types of data missing values and outliers de ath 2007 elith et al 2008 brt is a machine learning algorithm that combines two powerful statistical techniques boosting and regression trees friedman et al 2000 boosting is randomly selected to iteratively fit new tree models to minimize the loss function by forward and stage wise procedures yang et al 2016 regression trees are run with recursive binary splitting of the data until meeting the stop criterion cheong et al 2014 brt models are very elastic and efficacious in dealing with complex responses including nonlinearities and interactions elith et al 2008 the brt model differs from the traditional regression approach by boosting which adaptively produces huge numbers of comparatively ordinary tree models that improve predictive performance elith et al 2008 leathwick et al 2008 although they are easily interpreted can include any type of predictor variables and are insensitive to outliers regression trees are often biased and are not as accurate as other statistical methods as a classical approach mlsr has been widely used to predict the values of response variables applying the predictor variables and to analyze the interactions of these variables abbaszadeh et al 2013 da silva chagas et al 2016 yu et al 2016 mlsr takes into account several related factors and is extensively applied ishii et al 2014 stated that the mlsr method considers all of the relevant information and eliminates irrelevant factors simplifying the equations and reducing error variables are added one by one into the model and f tests are used to analyze the explanatory variables each variable is elected to the explanatory variables one by one and analyzed by t tests explanatory variables that are not significant are removed ishii et al 2014 yu et al 2016 so new variables are only added when the regression equation only contains significant variables caetano and vander heyden 2006 this is an iterative process that continues until no explanatory variables are added or removed from the equation chen et al 2015 dutta et al 2015 and the model only contains significant explanatory variables the brt and mlsr models have been widely applied in various soil property predictions including soil organic carbon minasny et al 2006 wang et al 2016 soil total nitrogen wang et al 2016 soil bulk density martin et al 2009 cation exchange capacity minasny and mcbratney 2008 and clay content sankey et al 2008 minasny and mcbratney 2008 mlsr combined with environmental variables or soil properties has been used worldwide for spatial prediction of pwp at different scales like in australia gooley et al 2014 padarian et al 2014 united states zheng et al 1996 nigeria obi et al 2014 and south korea hong et al 2013 however the brt model has not yet been applied in pwp mapping studies in this study we evaluated and compared the utility of brt and mlsr models for mapping topsoil 0 20 cm pwp in the arid and semi arid regions of northeast china the specific objectives were to 1 compare the efficacy of the brt and mlsr methods in estimating pwp 2 quantitatively analyze the importance of nine covariates on pwp variation and 3 map the pwp spatial distribution in a region with sparse sampling data 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area was in fuxin county a transition zone between the mongolian

measurement soil samples were collected at a depth of 0 20 cm during april 2012 a specific sampling strategy was used to choose the sampling sites zhu et al 2008 in general sampling points were determined based on elevation land use and the parent material to express the heterogeneity of the soil across our study area seventy sampling points were selected fig 1 a hand held global positioning system b06xjpcpp6 garmin olathe usa was used to record the characteristics of the sampling sites the profiles were described by pedogenic horizons until the c horizon or bedrock the pwp of the topsoil 0 20 cm was calculated using a soil water retention curve that was measured using pressure plate apparatus soil moisture equipment corp california usa at each sampling site undisturbed soil samples in a ring core 5 cm in height and 100 cm3 in volume were taken from the center of the topsoil and were soaked in tap water for 48 h during this process water levels were gradually increased by 1 mm on the edge of the following core to remove air from the soil after weighing the saturated soil samples were transferred to pressure plate apparatus to measure the water content at 1500 kpa of the matric potential for 25 to 28 days until no water came out of the chamber smith and mullins 1991 yang et al 2014 2 3 environmental covariates 2 3 1 topographical variables as one of the five soil formation factors jenny 1941 topography affects soil moisture and temperature digital elevation model dem was acquired from the shuttle radar topography mission at a 30 m resolution six primary and secondary terrain attributes were determined from the dem the primary terrain attributes were elevation slope aspect plan curvature profile curvature and slope gradient the secondary terrain attributes were the system for automated geoscientific analyses topographic wetness index twi and the catchment area olaya 2004 2 3 2 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi july to september is the growing season of crops in northeast china and the content of pwp is closely related to the growth of crops during this period soil moisture below pwp will lead to the death of plants thus remote sensing images from this period were selected to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi to cover the spatial domain of the study area six landsat 5 thematic mapper tm images from the united states geological survey usgs were acquired from july to september growing season 2012 on days with cloud cover less than 10 all images were relief corrected using the polynomial geometric correction method yang et al 2016 and were then mosaicked and pruned to overlap with the entire study area gao et al 2014 the visible red band 3 b3 0 63 0 69 μm near infrared band 4 b4 0 78 0 90 μm and short wave infrared band 5 b5 1 55 1 75 μm were used to represent vegetation growth coverage and biomass respectively malone et al 2009 the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was determined using b3 and b4 and was calculated as 1 ndvi b 4 b 3 b 4 b 3 2 3 3 land use data we used a raster map that was derived from remote sensing images landsat 5 in 2012 wang et al 2016 land use types were classed as cultivated land grassland forest unutilized land and other land use types including villages and rock outcrops which were coded as 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively we conducted correlation analyses between the target variables and the land use types 2 4 predictive models to construct the brt model the user must define four parameters 1 the learning rate lr controls the rate at which model complexity is increased carslaw and taylor 2009 2 tree complexity tc defines the depth of the tree and the maximum level of interaction between the predictor variables müller et al 2013 3 the number of trees nt is ensured by complex situation of lr and tc and 4 the bag fraction bf expresses the proportion of data used in each model elith et al 2008 the optimum values for these four parameters were obtained by running many simulations that spanned the ranges of the lr 0 05 0 001 the tc 6 10 the nt 500 1000 and 1500 and the bf 0 60 0 80 the optimal parameter combination was that which provided the minimum predictive error the final optimal setting of lr tc and bf were set to 0 025 9 and 0 70 respectively this combination generated an optimal nt of at least 1000 trees using a 10 fold cross validation method elith et al 2008 and yang et al 2016 recommended the use of no fewer than 1000 trees when fitting such models 2 5 model validation because of the low number of samples in the pwp dataset and the requirement for a unique accuracy measurement method a 10 fold cross validation procedure was used to evaluate the model performance in r version 3 2 2 r development core team 2013 cross validation is convenient in assessing model performance yang et al 2016 wang et al 2016 four indices were used to verify the performances of the brt and mlsr models between the observed and predicted values the mean absolute error mae the root mean square error rmse the coefficient of determination r2 and the concordance correlation coefficient ccc lin 1989 as described by eqs 2 3 4 and 5 2 mae 1

number of samples o and p are the variances of the observed and predicted values and i is the pearson correlation coefficient between the observed and predicted values 2 6 statistical analysis pearson s correlation coefficients were used to measure linear associations between the covariates using the cor test function in r r development core team 2013 pearson correlations were also used to examine the relationships between the pwp and the independent variables fitted brt models were obtained using the brt script provided by elith et al 2008 which references the packages dismo version 0 8 17 hijmans et al 2013 and gbm version 2 1 ridgeway 2007 in r the mlsr was implemented in r using the lm function which was used to perform a stepwise regression that identified the most significant explanatory variables 3 results 3 1 pwp and its relationship with predictors the pwp data exhibited a slightly positive skewed distribution and a thinner tail than a normal distribution the skewness and kurtosis coefficients were 0 38 and 0 35 respectively the average pwp in the topsoil 0 20 cm was 25 4 and ranged from 8 to 46 table 1 linear correlations between pwp and the quantitative predictors are presented in table 2 the pearson s correlation coefficients showed that the pwp was significantly correlated with topographical variables elevation slope gradient profile curvature and twi elevation r 0 50 slope gradient r 0 48 profile curvature r 0 45 twi r 0 43 and land use type r 0 36 were significantly correlated with pwp however the pwp and the ndvi exhibited a weak non significant correlation r 0 09 since the images were from different dates the generated ndvi cannot fully reflect actual vegetation growth in the study area which may produce some artificially high or extremely low values causing estimation errors thus it may not reflect the true relationship between ndvi and pwp we found that multicollinearity existed between the predictors thus stepwise linear regression was performed to remove closely related predictor variables consequently elevation slope gradient and profile curvature were the only variables in the final model which explained 54 of pwp variance adjusted r2 0 54 and had a significant f test result p 0 025 the model was expressed as the following equation 5 pwp 12 38 0 039 e l e v a t i o n 79 261 pr o c 1 729 s l o p e g r a d i e n t 3 2 importance of the covariates the relative importance of each environmental covariate according to all sampling points is shown in fig 2 the brt model was iterated 100 times to obtain the relative importance of each environmental variable bhatt et al 2013 and the relative importance of each variable was scaled to sum to 100 a high percentage indicates a high relative effect of that variable on the response variable cheong et al 2014 topographical variables were the main environmental indicators of pwp spatial variability in the northeastern arid and semi arid regions fig 2 the brt model revealed that the change of pwp was caused by the topographical variables followed by the landsat tm imagery and land use data the environmental variables differed in predicting the pwp the most important covariates were slope gradient 40 and elevation 20 both of which were consistent with the pearson correlation results r 0 48 and r 0 50 respectively slope aspect was the third most important covariate however pearson correlation coefficient was only 0 01 probably because slope gradient and elevation offset the effect of slope aspect the mlsr model found moderate correlations between the pwp and the covariates table 2 the most relevant covariates for predicting the pwp using the stepwise model were elevation slope gradient profile curvature the twi and land use type this issue might have been caused by multicollinearity 3 3 spatial prediction of pwp the pwp content ranged from 13 to 39 and 6 to 39 in the brt and mlsr models respectively the generation of spatial patterns in both models showed that pwp was high in the western of the study area fig 3 which was dominated by forest and grassland soils that contain eutrophic high activity clay the results of the predictive models brt and mlsr were evaluated using 10 fold cross validation the predictive performance of brt was better than that of mlsr as the results of the mlsr being more prone to extreme values obi et al 2014 and had higher mae rmse and lower r2 and ccc values than the brt model table 3 furthermore the brt model was run for 100 iterations which made the results more robust and prevented excessive fitting and the generation of extreme values the fitted model and density distributions figs 4 and 5 indicated that the observed and estimated data were evenly distributed on both sides of a 45 degree diagonal and the estimated values of the brt model were closer to the observed values than those of the mlsr model 4 discussion 4 1 model performance although 70 sampling sites were used to predict pwp in the brt model the brt prediction had an average r2 value of 57 which is comparable with the results from previous studies padarian et al 2014 used a dataset of 806 soil profiles and developed a support vector machine model to explain approximately 65 of the variance in the pwp in the australian wheat belt in a study in south korea hong et al 2013 used the physical and chemical properties of 380 soil samples to develop a pedotransfer function to predict the pwp which explained 61 of the variance in the pwp hong et al 2013 demonstrated that the accuracy of spatially predicting pwp depends on the accuracy of the pedotransfer function established from many sampling points in comparison the current study focused on evaluating soil formation coupled with soil landscape relationships hudson 1992 boettinger et al 2008 to improve mapping accuracy and reduce the need for expensive and time consuming field surveys yang et al 2016 indeed lopatin et al 2016 reported that linear models are more parsimonious and less biased than machine learning models random trees because of their non symmetric error distribution it is thought that machine learning models are unable to fully capture all of the variation in a system the mlsr model is widely used in predicting the pwp givi et al 2004 but few studies include environmental variables as independent variables obi et al 2014 applied topography attributes and particle size fractions to derive moisture characteristics and hydraulic conductivity in the topsoil 0 20 cm of the coastal plain compared with our results their results were quite inferior in predicting pwp however in a study conducted in south korea hong et al 2013 only included soil properties in the model as the main covariates which produced high r2 values and low rmse values for pwp compared with the previous application of the mlsr model our prediction results are comparable to previous studies givi et al 2004 hong et al 2013 obi et al 2014 gooley et al 2014 in addition the brt and mlsr models predicted that the spatial distribution of pwp was significantly different especially in high altitude areas after completing our analysis we believe that mlsr is a viable global variable model in the equation of the mlsr model the environmental variables were only assigned a constant value in the entire study area and could not be used to identify differences in conditions furthermore observing the best fit curve fig 4 we found that the observation and estimate data were evenly distributed on both sides of a 45 degree diagonal and the estimated value was closer to the observed value in the brt model therefore as a typical model of machine learning the brt model combined with the landscape model could be used to generate relatively accurate predictive value in each location lopatin et al 2016 wang et al 2016 of note the brt model generated lower averages and much lower standard deviations sds than the observed values table 1 consequently the predicted pwp variability was lower than the actual pwp variability compared with previous studies wang et al 2016 yang et al 2016 we generated a smaller change in sd values the brt model accurately predicted the spatial distribution of pwp in our study table 3 the high mean r2 value for pwp fig 6 was expected because all of the available data were included in the model furthermore the large spatial variability of the ndvi is useful for very complex and heterogeneous landscapes that contain forests yang et al 2016 which could be the reason for its highly accurate predictions the r2 variation for pwp based on the brt model was low fig 6 indicating that the model predictions were stable this phenomenon might have resulted from random selection effects of training and testing datasets this random method caused the multiple selection of data from only the training set or from only the testing set which is one of the main problems of the repeated data segmentation validation method dorji et al 2014 in addition both models described most of the spatial variability in pwp despite the low sampling density approximately 90 km2 per sample therefore a carefully designed sampling strategy is required for arid and semi arid areas wang et al 2016 in summary brt and mlsr models showed a satisfactory prediction effect for pwp both models explained 57 and 54 respectively of variation in pwp in the topsoil table 3 the accurate predictions by both models were probably related to the strong dependence of pwp on elevation slope gradient profile curvature the twi and land use variables the performances of the brt and mlsr models were comparable with those observed in previous studies although the environmental designs of our study were different to those of previous pwp studies hong et al 2013 padarian et al 2014 yang et al 2016 stated that the quantification of soil properties based on environmental covariate data is not a simple process because of the complexity of the soil the brt model performed slightly better than the mlsr model in predicting the pwp 4 2 estimates of pwp spatial patterns in pwp were closely correlated with topography as shown in the elevation map fig 3c the effects of topography on the pwp have been analyzed previously chaplot et al 2000 obi et al 2014 zheng et al 1996 obi et al 2014 reported that pwp increases with increasing altitude and precipitation and decreasing temperature in the northeast part of the study area barren hills and valleys are the main topographical features fig 3c these areas are associated with aridisols and primosols aridisols have a dry surface with an arid water conditions fan et al 2016 in addition vegetation coverage was approximately 5 5 in our study area and the dominant vegetation was xerophytic bunchgrass and xeromorphic shrubs the vegetation in this region is sparse and the total biomass decreases with decreasing precipitation su et al 2007 weak soil leaching which forms a characteristic surface with a low humus content and calcium carbonate gypsum and soluble salts in different layers of the profile limits water storage su et al 2007 fan et al 2016 therefore in the northeastern part of the study area soil porosity is not conducive to crop growth consequently pwp is low in this region 4 3 effects of covariates on pwp topography significantly influences the moisture characteristics and soil properties of the earth s surface behrens et al 2010 mcbratney et al 2003 sculla et al 2003 seibert et al 2007 stolt et al 1993 venterea et al 2003 and might explain much variation in pwp debella gilo et al 2007 moore et al 1993 moore and hutchinson 1991 padarian et al 2014 stated that digital elevation modeling is an extremely useful tool for predicting soil properties in the present study elevation had the greatest effect on pwp followed by slope gradient profile curvature and twi elevation affects temperature and precipitation pachepsky et al 2001 romano and palladino 2002 therefore it might indirectly affect soil moisture especially in arid and semi arid regions twi is important for both predictive soil mapping and hydrological modeling in a catchment area thompson et al 1997 thus it was used to quantitatively model the status of soil moisture dry or wet in addition twi has an important effect on pwp in arid and semi arid regions surprisingly slope aspect was the most weakly correlated variable with pwp among the topographical variables possibly because some of the sample sites were difficult to access because of steep slopes wang et al 2016 vegetation and land surface characteristics are major factors influencing the characteristic of topsoil pwp in arid and semi arid regions barnes et al 2014 hwang et al 2008 kumar 2015 our results were not entirely consistent with those obtained in previous studies possibly because the ndvi was mediated by topographical variables and land use data wang et al 2016 kumar 2015 considered the ndvi as a valuable indicator of surface moisture and evapotranspiration however we found that the ndvi was the most weakly correlated variable with pwp the low correlation between ndvi and pwp might be caused by the different dates of the six landsat images therefore the final generation of the spatial distribution map of ndvi cannot fully reflect the actual condition of the study area land use type is sensitive to soil moisture content therefore it has been widely used in studying soil moisture when using remote sensing we found that soil moisture content was the most important variable influencing the spatial distribution of pwp r 0 36 although certain predictors were important in both the brt and mlsr models we could not quantitatively determine their functional relationships with pwp spatial visualizations of the predictions are required to understand the mechanisms involved in predicting pwp 5 conclusions this study was conducted to map the spatial distribution of pwp by comparing brt and mlsr models in northeast china the results demonstrate that brt is effective for mapping the spatial patterns of pwp the brt model accurately predicted topsoil pwp based on the low values of mae and rmse and high values of r2 and ccc the brt and mlsr models predicted different spatial patterns in pwp because of differences in selecting variables for the models the pwp predicted using the brt model was greater than that using the mlsr model in arid regions pwp distribution was accurately predicted based on topographical variables such as those from a dem and was spatially linked to elevation these variables are important indicators of pwp in arid environments therefore we recommend that topographical variables receive adequate consideration when selecting variables for future pwp mapping particularly in arid regions considering the importance of pwp in regional water cycling maps derived from digital soil mapping approaches presenting accurate spatial pwp distribution would be very useful towards improving the conservation of arid ecosystems acknowledgments the study was supported by the national key

7074,the permanent wilting point pwp is the minimal point of soil moisture a plant requires not to wilt if moisture decreases to this or any lower point a plant wilts and can no longer recover its turgidity when placed in a saturated atmosphere for 12 h the pwp is an essential physical property that has a powerful influence on other soil properties and is important for agricultural production including irrigation water use efficiency and crop yield however there are few published datasets on the pwp of cultivated land in the arid and semi arid regions of northeast china direct measurements of pwp are time consuming and expensive therefore the aim of this study was to evaluate how environmental variables could be used in spatial predictions of pwp in an arid and semi arid region based on boosted regression tree brt and multiple linear stepwise regression mlsr analyses seventy soil samples and nine covariates including topography and vegetation variables were collected and analyzed cross validation procedure was used to evaluate model performance and uncertainty accuracy evaluation results showed that the brt model had better predictive performance than the mlsr pwp content decreased from the southwest to the northeast of the study area and average values of both models were 26 brt and mlsr models should be compared and calibrated to obtain the best prediction effect of pwp spatial distribution in similar areas elevation slope gradient profile curvature topographic wetness index and land use variables are the main environmental indicators that should be included when generating pwp maps of regions with a dry continental climate such information could aid local land managers and government agencies with evaluating soil quality and water sequestration potential in conclusion this study could be used as a reference for predicting the hydrological parameters of the topsoil in other similar ecological environments keywords digital soil mapping dsm boosted regression tree brt multiple linear stepwise regression mlsr 1 introduction the permanent wilting point pwp is the minimal point of soil moisture a plant requires not to wilt if moisture decreases to this or any lower point a plant wilts and can no longer recover its turgidity when placed in a saturated atmosphere for 12 h it is an important hydraulic property of the soil and has been widely used to calculate the water depth required for irrigation asgarzadeh et al 2011 groenevelt et al 2001 kirkham 2005 minasny and mcbratney 2003 and to determine water availability the information is important for assessing the suitability of a land area for producing a given crop hosseini et al 2016 in small or homogeneous areas only a few samples are required provide to accurate estimates of pwp givi et al 2004 however it is virtually impossible to determine the spatial variability of pwp in large areas when time and funds are limited therefore economical and rapid ways to estimate soil properties are needed mcbratney et al 2003 digital soil mapping dsm methods provide a low cost and rapid way to estimate pwp over large areas using few samples and environmental covariates mulder et al 2011 several previous studies have established relationships between different soil properties and various environmental variables including soil carbon storage stevens et al 2008 wang et al 2017 and particle size composition da silva chagas et al 2016 demattê et al 2007 however few studies estimated soil moisture content the most commonly used methods for predicting soil properties are multiple linear stepwise regression mlsr hong et al 2013 nanni and demattê 2006 linear mixed models rab et al 2011 geostatistical and hybrid methods poggio et al 2010 rab et al 2011 partial least squares regression gomez et al 2008 stevens et al 2008 genetic programming padarian et al 2014 parasuraman et al 2007 hierarchical spatial regression gooley et al 2014 support vector machines padarian et al 2014 and random forest models lopatin et al 2016 zhao et al 2016 despite various dsm methods being available selecting an optimum model to predict soil hydrological properties is not always straightforward boosted regression tree brt is a tree based model barthold et al 2008 ciampalini et al 2014a b martin et al 2011 peters et al 2008 that has rarely been used to model spatial variation in pwp brt combines many simple trees to improve predictive performance and robustness in comparison with single tree models that are based on traditional regression trees friedman and meulman 2003 skurichina and duin 2002 the fitted brt model is a linear combination of many simple trees and the results of several competing models that have merged jafari et al 2014 as a data mining method the brt model increases predictive performance by reducing over learning or over fitting the brt model provides information to evaluate summarize and interpret the fitted model and can incorporate different types of data missing values and outliers de ath 2007 elith et al 2008 brt is a machine learning algorithm that combines two powerful statistical techniques boosting and regression trees friedman et al 2000 boosting is randomly selected to iteratively fit new tree models to minimize the loss function by forward and stage wise procedures yang et al 2016 regression trees are run with recursive binary splitting of the data until meeting the stop criterion cheong et al 2014 brt models are very elastic and efficacious in dealing with complex responses including nonlinearities and interactions elith et al 2008 the brt model differs from the traditional regression approach by boosting which adaptively produces huge numbers of comparatively ordinary tree models that improve predictive performance elith et al 2008 leathwick et al 2008 although they are easily interpreted can include any type of predictor variables and are insensitive to outliers regression trees are often biased and are not as accurate as other statistical methods as a classical approach mlsr has been widely used to predict the values of response variables applying the predictor variables and to analyze the interactions of these variables abbaszadeh et al 2013 da silva chagas et al 2016 yu et al 2016 mlsr takes into account several related factors and is extensively applied ishii et al 2014 stated that the mlsr method considers all of the relevant information and eliminates irrelevant factors simplifying the equations and reducing error variables are added one by one into the model and f tests are used to analyze the explanatory variables each variable is elected to the explanatory variables one by one and analyzed by t tests explanatory variables that are not significant are removed ishii et al 2014 yu et al 2016 so new variables are only added when the regression equation only contains significant variables caetano and vander heyden 2006 this is an iterative process that continues until no explanatory variables are added or removed from the equation chen et al 2015 dutta et al 2015 and the model only contains significant explanatory variables the brt and mlsr models have been widely applied in various soil property predictions including soil organic carbon minasny et al 2006 wang et al 2016 soil total nitrogen wang et al 2016 soil bulk density martin et al 2009 cation exchange capacity minasny and mcbratney 2008 and clay content sankey et al 2008 minasny and mcbratney 2008 mlsr combined with environmental variables or soil properties has been used worldwide for spatial prediction of pwp at different scales like in australia gooley et al 2014 padarian et al 2014 united states zheng et al 1996 nigeria obi et al 2014 and south korea hong et al 2013 however the brt model has not yet been applied in pwp mapping studies in this study we evaluated and compared the utility of brt and mlsr models for mapping topsoil 0 20 cm pwp in the arid and semi arid regions of northeast china the specific objectives were to 1 compare the efficacy of the brt and mlsr methods in estimating pwp 2 quantitatively analyze the importance of nine covariates on pwp variation and 3 map the pwp spatial distribution in a region with sparse sampling data 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area was in fuxin county a transition zone between the mongolian plateau and the liaohe plain in northeast china which is 6264 km2 in area and ranges from 0 to 866 m above sea level 41 73 42 56 n 122 01 122 43 e fig 1 the rugged and mountainous landscape is characterizing by deep valleys gorges and high peaks it has a warm temperate continental monsoon climate with four seasons a dry and windy spring a hot and rainy summer a cool fall and a cold winter with little snow the mean annual precipitation is 500 mm and the mean annual temperature is 7 2 c this study area belongs to typical mainland monsoon climate the rainfall displays an uneven characteristic whereby about 70 and 85 of the precipitation is concentrated in the summer cultivated land is the main land use type and occupies 37 of the study area the remaining land use types are unutilized land 19 natural grassland 18 forest 14 and other land uses including villages and rocky outcrops 12 the land use types are the main land use systems of northeast china corn and soybean are the main crops and peanuts and fruits are grown in rotation aridisols and primosols are the dominant soil types cooperative research group on chinese soil taxonomy 2001 2 2 sample collection and measurement soil samples were collected at a depth of 0 20 cm during april 2012 a specific sampling strategy was used to choose the sampling sites zhu et al 2008 in general sampling points were determined based on elevation land use and the parent material to express the heterogeneity of the soil across our study area seventy sampling points were selected fig 1 a hand held global positioning system b06xjpcpp6 garmin olathe usa was used to record the characteristics of the sampling sites the profiles were described by pedogenic horizons until the c horizon or bedrock the pwp of the topsoil 0 20 cm was calculated using a soil water retention curve that was measured using pressure plate apparatus soil moisture equipment corp california usa at each sampling site undisturbed soil samples in a ring core 5 cm in height and 100 cm3 in volume were taken from the center of the topsoil and were soaked in tap water for 48 h during this process water levels were gradually increased by 1 mm on the edge of the following core to remove air from the soil after weighing the saturated soil samples were transferred to pressure plate apparatus to measure the water content at 1500 kpa of the matric potential for 25 to 28 days until no water came out of the chamber smith and mullins 1991 yang et al 2014 2 3 environmental covariates 2 3 1 topographical variables as one of the five soil formation factors jenny 1941 topography affects soil moisture and temperature digital elevation model dem was acquired from the shuttle radar topography mission at a 30 m resolution six primary and secondary terrain attributes were determined from the dem the primary terrain attributes were elevation slope aspect plan curvature profile curvature and slope gradient the secondary terrain attributes were the system for automated geoscientific analyses topographic wetness index twi and the catchment area olaya 2004 2 3 2 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi july to september is the growing season of crops in northeast china and the content of pwp is closely related to the growth of crops during this period soil moisture below pwp will lead to the death of plants thus remote sensing images from this period were selected to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi to cover the spatial domain of the study area six landsat 5 thematic mapper tm images from the united states geological survey usgs were acquired from july to september growing season 2012 on days with cloud cover less than 10 all images were relief corrected using the polynomial geometric correction method yang et al 2016 and were then mosaicked and pruned to overlap with the entire study area gao et al 2014 the visible red band 3 b3 0 63 0 69 μm near infrared band 4 b4 0 78 0 90 μm and short wave infrared band 5 b5 1 55 1 75 μm were used to represent vegetation growth coverage and biomass respectively malone et al 2009 the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was determined using b3 and b4 and was calculated as 1 ndvi b 4 b 3 b 4 b 3 2 3 3 land use data we used a raster map that was derived from remote sensing images landsat 5 in 2012 wang et al 2016 land use types were classed as cultivated land grassland forest unutilized land and other land use types including villages and rock outcrops which were coded as 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively we conducted correlation analyses between the target variables and the land use types 2 4 predictive models to construct the brt model the user must define four parameters 1 the learning rate lr controls the rate at which model complexity is increased carslaw and taylor 2009 2 tree complexity tc defines the depth of the tree and the maximum level of interaction between the predictor variables müller et al 2013 3 the number of trees nt is ensured by complex situation of lr and tc and 4 the bag fraction bf expresses the proportion of data used in each model elith et al 2008 the optimum values for these four parameters were obtained by running many simulations that spanned the ranges of the lr 0 05 0 001 the tc 6 10 the nt 500 1000 and 1500 and the bf 0 60 0 80 the optimal parameter combination was that which provided the minimum predictive error the final optimal setting of lr tc and bf were set to 0 025 9 and 0 70 respectively this combination generated an optimal nt of at least 1000 trees using a 10 fold cross validation method elith et al 2008 and yang et al 2016 recommended the use of no fewer than 1000 trees when fitting such models 2 5 model validation because of the low number of samples in the pwp dataset and the requirement for a unique accuracy measurement method a 10 fold cross validation procedure was used to evaluate the model performance in r version 3 2 2 r development core team 2013 cross validation is convenient in assessing model performance yang et al 2016 wang et al 2016 four indices were used to verify the performances of the brt and mlsr models between the observed and predicted values the mean absolute error mae the root mean square error rmse the coefficient of determination r2 and the concordance correlation coefficient ccc lin 1989 as described by eqs 2 3 4 and 5 2 mae 1

number of samples o and p are the variances of the observed and predicted values and i is the pearson correlation coefficient between the observed and predicted values 2 6 statistical analysis pearson s correlation coefficients were used to measure linear associations between the covariates using the cor test function in r r development core team 2013 pearson correlations were also used to examine the relationships between the pwp and the independent variables fitted brt models were obtained using the brt script provided by elith et al 2008 which references the packages dismo version 0 8 17 hijmans et al 2013 and gbm version 2 1 ridgeway 2007 in r the mlsr was implemented in r using the lm function which was used to perform a stepwise regression that identified the most significant explanatory variables 3 results 3 1 pwp and its relationship with predictors the pwp data exhibited a slightly positive skewed distribution and a thinner tail than a normal distribution the skewness and kurtosis coefficients were 0 38 and 0 35 respectively the average pwp in the topsoil 0 20 cm was 25 4 and ranged from 8 to 46 table 1 linear correlations between pwp and the quantitative predictors are presented in table 2 the pearson s correlation coefficients showed that the pwp was significantly correlated with topographical variables elevation slope gradient profile curvature and twi elevation r 0 50 slope gradient r 0 48 profile curvature r 0 45 twi r 0 43 and land use type r 0 36 were significantly correlated with pwp however the pwp and the ndvi exhibited a weak non significant correlation r 0 09 since the images were from different dates the generated ndvi cannot fully reflect actual vegetation growth in the study area which may produce some artificially high or extremely low values causing estimation errors thus it may not reflect the true relationship between ndvi and pwp we found that multicollinearity existed between the predictors thus stepwise linear regression was performed to remove closely related predictor variables consequently elevation slope gradient and profile curvature were the only variables in the final model which explained 54 of pwp variance adjusted r2 0 54 and had a significant f test result p 0 025 the model was expressed as the following equation 5 pwp 12 38 0 039 e l e v a t i o n 79 261 pr o c 1 729 s l o p e g r a d i e n t 3 2 importance of the covariates the relative importance of each environmental covariate according to all sampling points is shown in fig 2 the brt model was iterated 100 times to obtain the relative importance of each environmental variable bhatt et al 2013 and the relative importance of each variable was scaled to sum to 100 a high percentage indicates a high relative effect of that variable on the response variable cheong et al 2014 topographical variables were the main environmental indicators of pwp spatial variability in the northeastern arid and semi arid regions fig 2 the brt model revealed that the change of pwp was caused by the topographical variables followed by the landsat tm imagery and land use data the environmental variables differed in predicting the pwp the most important covariates were slope gradient 40 and elevation 20 both of which were consistent with the pearson correlation results r 0 48 and r 0 50 respectively slope aspect was the third most important covariate however pearson correlation coefficient was only 0 01 probably because slope gradient and elevation offset the effect of slope aspect the mlsr model found moderate correlations between the pwp and the covariates table 2 the most relevant covariates for predicting the pwp using the stepwise model were elevation slope gradient profile curvature the twi and land use type this issue might have been caused by multicollinearity 3 3 spatial prediction of pwp the pwp content ranged from 13 to 39 and 6 to 39 in the brt and mlsr models respectively the generation of spatial patterns in both models showed that pwp was high in the western of the study area fig 3 which was dominated by forest and grassland soils that contain eutrophic high activity clay the results of the predictive models brt and mlsr were evaluated using 10 fold cross validation the predictive performance of brt was better than that of mlsr as the results of the mlsr being more prone to extreme values obi et al 2014 and had higher mae rmse and lower r2 and ccc values than the brt model table 3 furthermore the brt model was run for 100 iterations which made the results more robust and prevented excessive fitting and the generation of extreme values the fitted model and density distributions figs 4 and 5 indicated that the observed and estimated data were evenly distributed on both sides of a 45 degree diagonal and the estimated values of the brt model were closer to the observed values than those of the mlsr model 4 discussion 4 1 model performance although 70 sampling sites were used to predict pwp in the brt model the brt prediction had an average r2 value of 57 which is comparable with the results from previous studies padarian et al 2014 used a dataset of 806 soil profiles and developed a support vector machine model to explain approximately 65 of the variance in the pwp in the australian wheat belt in a study in south korea hong et al 2013 used the physical and chemical properties of 380 soil samples to develop a pedotransfer function to predict the pwp which explained 61 of the variance in the pwp hong et al 2013 demonstrated that the accuracy of spatially predicting pwp depends on the accuracy of the pedotransfer function established from many sampling points in comparison the current study focused on evaluating soil formation coupled with soil landscape relationships hudson 1992 boettinger et al 2008 to improve mapping accuracy and reduce the need for expensive and time consuming field surveys yang et al 2016 indeed lopatin et al 2016 reported that linear models are more parsimonious and less biased than machine learning models random trees because of their non symmetric error distribution it is thought that machine learning models are unable to fully capture all of the variation in a system the mlsr model is widely used in predicting the pwp givi et al 2004 but few studies include environmental variables as independent variables obi et al 2014 applied topography attributes and particle size fractions to derive moisture characteristics and hydraulic conductivity in the topsoil 0 20 cm of the coastal plain compared with our results their results were quite inferior in predicting pwp however in a study conducted in south korea hong et al 2013 only included soil properties in the model as the main covariates which produced high r2 values and low rmse values for pwp compared with the previous application of the mlsr model our prediction results are comparable to previous studies givi et al 2004 hong et al 2013 obi et al 2014 gooley et al 2014 in addition the brt and mlsr models predicted that the spatial distribution of pwp was significantly different especially in high altitude areas after completing our analysis we believe that mlsr is a viable global variable model in the equation of the mlsr model the environmental variables were only assigned a constant value in the entire study area and could not be used to identify differences in conditions furthermore observing the best fit curve fig 4 we found that the observation and estimate data were evenly distributed on both sides of a 45 degree diagonal and the estimated value was closer to the observed value in the brt model therefore as a typical model of machine learning the brt model combined with the landscape model could be used to generate relatively accurate predictive value in each location lopatin et al 2016 wang et al 2016 of note the brt model generated lower averages and much lower standard deviations sds than the observed values table 1 consequently the predicted pwp variability was lower than the actual pwp variability compared with previous studies wang et al 2016 yang et al 2016 we generated a smaller change in sd values the brt model accurately predicted the spatial distribution of pwp in our study table 3 the high mean r2 value for pwp fig 6 was expected because all of the available data were included in the model furthermore the large spatial variability of the ndvi is useful for very complex and heterogeneous landscapes that contain forests yang et al 2016 which could be the reason for its highly accurate predictions the r2 variation for pwp based on the brt model was low fig 6 indicating that the model predictions were stable this phenomenon might have resulted from random selection effects of training and testing datasets this random method caused the multiple selection of data from only the training set or from only the testing set which is one of the main problems of the repeated data segmentation validation method dorji et al 2014 in addition both models described most of the spatial variability in pwp despite the low sampling density approximately 90 km2 per sample therefore a carefully designed sampling strategy is required for arid and semi arid areas wang et al 2016 in summary brt and mlsr models showed a satisfactory prediction effect for pwp both models explained 57 and 54 respectively of variation in pwp in the topsoil table 3 the accurate predictions by both models were probably related to the strong dependence of pwp on elevation slope gradient profile curvature the twi and land use variables the performances of the brt and mlsr models were comparable with those observed in previous studies although the environmental designs of our study were different to those of previous pwp studies hong et al 2013 padarian et al 2014 yang et al 2016 stated that the quantification of soil properties based on environmental covariate data is not a simple process because of the complexity of the soil the brt model performed slightly better than the mlsr model in predicting the pwp 4 2 estimates of pwp spatial patterns in pwp were closely correlated with topography as shown in the elevation map fig 3c the effects of topography on the pwp have been analyzed previously chaplot et al 2000 obi et al 2014 zheng et al 1996 obi et al 2014 reported that pwp increases with increasing altitude and precipitation and decreasing temperature in the northeast part of the study area barren hills and valleys are the main topographical features fig 3c these areas are associated with aridisols and primosols aridisols have a dry surface with an arid water conditions fan et al 2016 in addition vegetation coverage was approximately 5 5 in our study area and the dominant vegetation was xerophytic bunchgrass and xeromorphic shrubs the vegetation in this region is sparse and the total biomass decreases with decreasing precipitation su et al 2007 weak soil leaching which forms a characteristic surface with a low humus content and calcium carbonate gypsum and soluble salts in different layers of the profile limits water storage su et al 2007 fan et al 2016 therefore in the northeastern part of the study area soil porosity is not conducive to crop growth consequently pwp is low in this region 4 3 effects of covariates on pwp topography significantly influences the moisture characteristics and soil properties of the earth s surface behrens et al 2010 mcbratney et al 2003 sculla et al 2003 seibert et al 2007 stolt et al 1993 venterea et al 2003 and might explain much variation in pwp debella gilo et al 2007 moore et al 1993 moore and hutchinson 1991 padarian et al 2014 stated that digital elevation modeling is an extremely useful tool for predicting soil properties in the present study elevation had the greatest effect on pwp followed by slope gradient profile curvature and twi elevation affects temperature and precipitation pachepsky et al 2001 romano and palladino 2002 therefore it might indirectly affect soil moisture especially in arid and semi arid regions twi is important for both predictive soil mapping and hydrological modeling in a catchment area thompson et al 1997 thus it was used to quantitatively model the status of soil moisture dry or wet in addition twi has an important effect on pwp in arid and semi arid regions surprisingly slope aspect was the most weakly correlated variable with pwp among the topographical variables possibly because some of the sample sites were difficult to access because of steep slopes wang et al 2016 vegetation and land surface characteristics are major factors influencing the characteristic of topsoil pwp in arid and semi arid regions barnes et al 2014 hwang et al 2008 kumar 2015 our results were not entirely consistent with those obtained in previous studies possibly because the ndvi was mediated by topographical variables and land use data wang et al 2016 kumar 2015 considered the ndvi as a valuable indicator of surface moisture and evapotranspiration however we found that the ndvi was the most weakly correlated variable with pwp the low correlation between ndvi and pwp might be caused by the different dates of the six landsat images therefore the final generation of the spatial distribution map of ndvi cannot fully reflect the actual condition of the study area land use type is sensitive to soil moisture content therefore it has been widely used in studying soil moisture when using remote sensing we found that soil moisture content was the most important variable influencing the spatial distribution of pwp r 0 36 although certain predictors were important in both the brt and mlsr models we could not quantitatively determine their functional relationships with pwp spatial visualizations of the predictions are required to understand the mechanisms involved in predicting pwp 5 conclusions this study was conducted to map the spatial distribution of pwp by comparing brt and mlsr models in northeast china the results demonstrate that brt is effective for mapping the spatial patterns of pwp the brt model accurately predicted topsoil pwp based on the low values of mae and rmse and high values of r2 and ccc the brt and mlsr models predicted different spatial patterns in pwp because of differences in selecting variables for the models the pwp predicted using the brt model was greater than that using the mlsr model in arid regions pwp distribution was accurately predicted based on topographical variables such as those from a dem and was spatially linked to elevation these variables are important indicators of pwp in arid environments therefore we recommend that topographical variables receive adequate consideration when selecting variables for future pwp mapping particularly in arid regions considering the importance of pwp in regional water cycling maps derived from digital soil mapping approaches presenting accurate spatial pwp distribution would be very useful towards improving the conservation of arid ecosystems acknowledgments the study was supported by the national key
