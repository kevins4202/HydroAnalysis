3240,the soil moisture active passive smap mission provides state of the art global soil moisture sm datasets however seasonal sm biases and their contributing factors have not be systematically reviewed this study evaluated the biases of smap v6 dual channel algorithm dca single channel algorithm h pol sca h and v pol sca v sm products based on core validation sites data all algorithms perform better under clear than cloudy sky and in cloudless daytime than nighttime consecutive clear sky benefits sm retrieval progressively lowering the uncertainty of sm retrievals while at the cost of dry biases cloudy sky deteriorates the quality of sm retrievals and wet biases increase with the duration time of cloudy sky the modified v7 dca has a major improvement owning the potential to provide accurate retrievals under cloudy sky smap sm biases are co determined by vegetation index soil temperature and their biases and a single factor only explains at most 54 variance in sm biases generally smap sm bias is negatively correlated with soil temperature and positively correlated with its bias sm bias correlates positively with vegetation index and its bias for single channel algorithms and the underestimation of sm increases with vegetation density for dca to get a complete picture of smap sm biases a total differential of radiative transfer equation is recommended for decomposing smap sm biases to this end more validation sites are required covering diverse land cover types and providing continuous data records keywords smap soil moisture validation core validation site vegetation bias soil temperature data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the national aeronautics and space administration nasa l band soil moisture active passive smap mission provides global soil moisture sm products based on the double channel algorithm dca the single channel algorithm h pol sca h and v pol sca v chan et al 2016 these products have largely improved hydrological studies including drought assessment and runoff prediction jadidoleslam et al 2019 mishra et al 2017 prior to the smap sm v8 the baseline sca v product has been extensively validated against the international soil moisture network ismn data al yaari et al 2019 the core validation sites cvs data colliander et al 2017a the high resolution modelling data tavakol et al 2019 and other remotely sensed products chen et al 2018 for in situ based validation the evaluation metrics generally include correlation coefficient r bias root mean square error rmse and unbiased rmse ubrmse gruber et al 2020 the smap sca v sm product is well recognized to have a state of the art accuracy of ubrmse 0 04 cm3 cm 3 chan et al 2016 chan et al 2018 colliander et al 2017a smap sm retrieval requires both static slow varying or assumed unchanged and dynamic rapid changing variables most of which are provided as ancillary data and shared by sca and dca the two major dynamic variables are vegetation optical depth vod and effective soil temperature sca s use the 2000 2010 moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis normalized difference vegetation index ndvi climatology to calculate vod while dca simultaneously retrieves sm and vod both algorithms parameterize effective soil temperature based on the multilayered global modeling and assimilation office gmao soil temperature data chan et al 2016 a new parameterization scheme of effective soil temperature has been used in the smap v7 product o neill et al 2020 in the new scheme the correction factor k is revised depending on land cover types and the first soil layer is revised from 0 to 10 cm to 5 15 cm and the second layer is revised from 15 to 20 cm to 15 30 cm these dynamic variables and their biases might cause seasonally varying biases in smap sm retrievals colliander et al 2019b the accuracy of smap sm products varies depending on land use land cover types climate zones vegetation densities and other hydrothermal conditions al yaari et al 2019 ma et al 2019 zhang et al 2019b due to complexities of sm errors metrics values are generally categorized by the above factors to determine a general pattern the effects of dynamic variables have recently received increased attention especially for vegetation effects ebrahimi khusfi et al 2018 showed a stronger dependence of sm errors on vod than vegetation scattering albedo and soil roughness recommending the introduction of soil moisture and ocean salinity smos vod to improve smap sm retrieval ebrahimi et al 2018 kim et al 2018 and kumar et al 2018 found low errors over moderately vegetated areas independently whereas zhang et al 2019b reported low errors over sparsely vegetated areas regarding vegetation biases large smap sm biases have been found in areas where vegetation parameters deviate from climatological expectations e g in cropland areas colliander et al 2019a dong et al 2018 singh et al 2019 zwieback et al 2018 the resulting smap sm biases might impede seasonal comparison of sm dynamics dynamic variables also include soil temperature zhang et al 2019 showed that smap sm retrievals performed better in areas with higher land surface temperature colliander et al 2019b found a strong positive relationship between sm bias and soil temperature in a temperate and a cold cropland site regarding soil temperature biases however colliander et al 2019b found a moderate positive relationship only for the temperate site zhang et al 2019a reported that low biases in effective soil temperature resulted in underestimation of sm in high cold mountainous areas fan et al 2020 reported the similar underestimation issues over global vegetation disturbed areas the more underestimation of soil temperature the more underestimation of sm which is similar to the positive relationship in colliander et al 2019b over the permafrost qinghai tibet plateau area xing et al 2021 have recently showed that overestimation of smap sm retrievals can be partly explained by the overestimation of effective soil temperature soil wetness is an overall representation of land surface conditions based on the ismn dataset zhang et al 2019b reported a strong negative relationship between sm bias and soil wetness across all climate zones indicating an underestimation of smap enhanced sm based on sca v for wetter soils the same pattern has been also found in france el hajj et al 2018 india singh et al 2019 north america suman et al 2020 and northeast china lou et al 2019 however several core validation sites also show underestimation of sm for dry soils and overestimation of sm for wet soils e g the remedhus and yanco sites colliander et al 2017a soil wetness changes microwave penetration depths especially during the soil wetting and drying processes colliander et al 2020b reported wetter smap sm biases during rain events because smap senses the rainwater before it is propagating to the position of in situ sensors which indicates an overestimation of sm for wetter soils for the drying processes after rains the shallower smap penetration depth caused a shorter time a larger magnitude and a faster rate of soil drying as compared to in situ observations shellito et al 2016 overall soil wetness itself causes a complicated impact on smap sm retrieval dynamic soil wetness vegetation and soil temperature parameters all contribute to smap sm biases due to land surface complexities however conflicting conclusions on causal factors can be derived in addition most of current studies only validate the smap baseline sca v product leaving the sca h and dca has replaced sca v as baseline since smap sm v8 products poorly validated inspired by the recent work of colliander et al 2020b this study comprehensively evaluates time varying biases of smap sm products sca v sca h and dca in both ascending and descending orbits based on core validation sites data first the overall accuracy of sm products is evaluated then sm products are evaluated as per clear and cloudy sky conditions represented by cloud percentage information lastly linear and nonlinear models are developed to separate the contributions of varied dynamic variables to sm biases the results are expected to provide a new insight into the biases of smap sm products 2 methods and data processing 2 1 evaluating overall smap sm accuracy based on core validation sites data the smap in situ core validation site land surface parameters match up data version 1 include spatially and temporally matched smap sca h sca v and dca sm retrievals and in situ sm observations at globally distributed sites colliander et al 2017b providing a ready to use reference to evaluate multi scale smap sm retrievals colliander et al 2017a in this study we extracted the 36 km smap v6 sca h sm sca v sm dca sm gmao soil temperature tsurf in situ weighted average sm wasm and weighted soil temperature wast data at seven core validation sites including five cropland sites and two grassland sites table 1 these sites have enough data records within march 2016 december 2018 when global hourly cloud percentage data described below are available date time data quality flags and orbit number flagging a m or p m orbits were also extracted at each site the a m and p m orbit data were first separated by orbit number data were kept only if all three algorithms generated quality assured sm retrievals and the in situ reference pixel quality flag was valid although leading to a reduction in sample size this processing guarantees a fair comparison among different retrieval algorithms the final numbers of a m and p m orbits data records per site are shown in table 1 based on all sites data r bias and ubrmse values were calculated to characterize the overall performance of each product in both a m and p m orbits the spatial coverage of the txson site overlaps the smap 36 km grid centered at 30 5 n 98 5 w to evaluate possible improvements in the smap v7 product the new versions of smap sca h sca v and dca sm data and gmao soil temperature data were extracted at this site after data screening based on quality flags the common sample size shared by smap v6 and v7 products was 383 in a m orbit and was 352 in p m orbit the r bias and ubrmse values against in situ sm observations and the soil temperatures were compared between the two versions of products 2 2 evaluating weather effects on smap sm accuracy cloud coverage can reflect weather conditions which drive soil drying and wetting processes that are supposed to affect sm retrievals in this study we obtained the hourly 0 25 0 3125 merged global cloud percentage dataset from the nasa langley cloud and radiation center the dataset is derived based on the visible infrared solar infrared split window technique visst sist minnis et al 2011 supported by multiple geostationary satellite observations to form a global coverage cloud percentage ranges from 0 to 100 representing totally cloud free to fully cloud covered situations the data within 12 h before smap overpasses were extracted per site for each data record for a m retrievals cloud data started in the preceding 6p m and ended in 5 a m local time for p m retrievals cloud data started in 6 a m and ended in 5p m local time in the same day the nearest neighboring method was used for spatial match considering the similar coarse resolutions of cloud and sm data the weathers were classified as clear and cloudy based on cloud percentage values to include as many samples for a robust statistical analysis clear weathers were defined as having a cloud percentage 20 and cloudy weathers as having a cloud percentage 80 in each orbit all sites data were combined to examine the effects of clear sky or cloudy sky duration time on smap sm retrievals the clear sky or cloudy sky duration time 1 12 h was defined as the continuous hours of clear or cloudy skies before smap overpassing time in both conditions the r bias and ubrmse values were calculated at each time interval for all three algorithms in both orbits 2 3 modis vegetation data and vegetation biases smap uses modis ndvi climatology in its single channel algorithms effectively assuming no deviations in phenology evolution from its climatology the effects on sm retrievals were examined based on realistic ndvi data to this end the 16 day 5 km resolution terra and aqua modis ndvi datasets mod13c1 and myd13c1 were obtained with an equivalent 8 day resolution the combined ndvi dataset has largely reduced angular and cloud effects for each site the nearest modis 5 km grid was found and ndvi values were extracted for the 7 7 grids 35 km 35 km approximate to smap grid size centered on that grid all grids values fagged with good data or marginal data were kept and averaged time series ndvi values were obtained in a similar fashion and a spline interpolation method was used to derive daily ndvi values note that the peak and valley ndvi values were not recovered if the majority of original data were lacking the 1 km ancillary modis ndvi climatological data were obtained and were spatially aggregated to 36 km based on sites coordinates at each site daily vegetation biases were calculated by subtracting the realistic ndvi values from the climatological ndvi values a positive vegetation bias means an overestimation of vegetation effects and a negative vegetation bias means an underestimation both the realistic ndvi and ndvi bias values were extracted and calculated for all data records 2 4 investigating dominant factors for smap sm biases based on literature review dynamic influential factors of smap sm biases include soil wetness colliander et al 2020b vegetation density gao et al 2021 vegetation bias zwieback et al 2018 soil temperature zhang et al 2019b and soil temperature bias fan et al 2020 specifically in this study the factors were in situ soil moisture content ndvi ndvi bias climatological minus realistic in situ soil temperature and soil temperature bias gmao minus in situ two statistical approaches were used to quantify relationships between sm biases and these factors first pearson s correlation coefficients were calculated and the best correlated factor was determined second random forest rf models were developed predicting sm biases based on all factors both approaches were applied to a m and p m retrievals of all three algorithms at each site therefore a total of 42 groups three algorithms by two orbits by seven sites of data were analyzed for rf modelling the tree number was set as 200 and the leaf number was set as 5 the modelling processing was repeated for 200 times and each time uses randomly 80 samples for model training and the remaining for model validation the models outputs include r 2 total variance explained ubrmse and permutation based variable importance measures for each factor nicodemus et al 2010 these values were averaged after 200 times of rf modelling those factors having a variable importance measure value 1 huang et al 2013 were considered to be important for smap sm biases because rf models were used primarily to determine important factors the models parameters were assumed defaulted values and were not fine tuned 3 results 3 1 overall accuracy of smap sm retrievals based on all sites data smap v6 sca v and dca retrievals are almost unbiased in both a m and p m orbits and the sca h significantly underestimates sm fig 1 as the smap sm v6 baseline algorithm sca v performs the best followed by dca and sca h bias values differ among sites and between land cover types for the two grassland sites txson and mongolian site sca v retrievals are almost unbiased see txson site in fig 2 for the five cropland sites sca v sm bias values range between 0 067 and 0 033 cm3 cm 3 in a m orbit and between 0 074 and 0 036 cm3 cm 3 in p m orbit all algorithms perform better in p m orbit than in a m orbit which is contrary to the well known impression that a m retrievals outperform p m retrievals due to better soil canopy thermal equilibrium at the txson site reparameterization of effective soil temperature has led to more negative biases for smap v7 sm fig 3 bias values are decreased by 0 011 0 012 cm3 cm 3 0 013 0 014 cm3 cm 3 and 0 021 0 016 cm3 cm 3 in a m p m orbit respectively for sca h sca v and dca the mean decrease in soil temperature is 3 9 k in a m orbit and is 4 4 k in p m orbit the 4 k decrease in soil temperature converts to a decrease of 0 01 0 02 cm3 cm 3 in sm bias the v7 dca has a substantial improvement in all metrics based on the txson site data the new versions of sca h and sca v improve marginally in terms of r and ubrmse but both are subject to underestimations 3 2 diurnal weather effects on smap sm data quality it seems that clear skies benefit smap sm retrievals fig 4 and cloudy skies hamper smap sm retrievals fig 5 in terms of r and ubrmse similar to the overall validation results in fig 1 sca v also outperforms sca h and dca under clear skies however dca outperforms sca h and performs comparably to sca v under cloudy skies irrespective of clear or cloudy skies the effects of clear and cloudy sky duration time on smap sm retrievals are similar to each other for sca h sca v and dca regarding clear sky sca v retrievals r increases and ubrmse decreases with the duration time of clear skies especially in p m orbit the r and ubrmse values are consistently better than the corresponding overall values in fig 1 for a m retrievals the ubrmse values fall below 0 04 cm3 cm 3 if it is cloud free before 9p m last night for p m retrievals the ubrmse values are well below 0 04 cm3 cm 3 even if it is not clear up until smap overpasses the r values are above 0 90 if clear skies are kept throughout the afternoon the longer the sunshine duration time the better the smap sm retrievals under clear skies all algorithms show dry sm biases unlike clear sky retrievals no explicit patterns are found for cloudy sky retrievals in terms of r and ubrmse one important reason is that clouds can be precipitating or non precipitating which causes different impacts on smap sm retrievals despite this two findings can be obtained based on fig 5 first the r values 0 85 and ubrmse 0 05 cm3 cm 3 values are always less good than the corresponding overall values in fig 1 indicative of poorer algorithms performances in cloudy sky conditions second the wet sm biases become wetter with more cloudy sky duration time for all algorithms which might be attributed to precipitation the longer the cloudy sky duration time the higher the probability of precipitation events and the wetter the smap sm biases 3 3 dynamic controls on smap sm biases the major factors of smap sm biases depend on algorithms and sites table s1 s5 soil temperature and its bias are the dominant factors at the remedhus site for single channel algorithms sm bias correlates with soil wetness at the monte buey and txson sites positive for the former and negative for the latter vegetation parameters ndvi and its bias dominate smap sm biases at the yanco carman kenaston and mongolian sites table 2 at each site the major factors are similar for single channel algorithms and even in both orbits dca seems to be more affected by soil temperature biases followed by vegetation density general patterns of smap sm biases can be obtained from the statistical analyses table 2 and table s1 s5 sm bias is negatively correlated with soil temperature 5 6 in table 2 30 42 in table s3 indicative of drier sm biases for hotter soils the positive correlation between sm bias and soil temperature bias all 8 cases in table 2 and 35 42 in table s5 corroborates the decrease of sm bias with the decrease of soil temperature in table 2 sm bias is positively correlated with ndvi all 9 cases and its bias all five cases for single channel algorithms which means that a high or an overestimation of vegetation density might cause an overestimation of smap sca sm however sm bias is negatively correlated with ndvi for dca all 4 cases in table 2 and fig 6 indicating that dca might underestimate sm in densely vegetated areas 3 4 multifaceted influences on smap sm biases smap sm biases are jointly determined by multiple factors based on univariate correlation analyses results table s1 s5 none of the factors can explain 54 variance in sm biases taking the a m orbit sca v retrievals for an example fig 7 no single factors share a similar temporal pattern to smap sm biases which show large short term variabilities vegetation changes are generally slower and temporally more continuous than soil temperature and sm changes and the effects are basically smooth fig 6 and fig 7 the variabilities in smap sm biases might result from rapid changing soil temperatures and land surface conditions represented by soil moisture and other factors unaccounted the above speculation is validated by the variable importance measure results fig 8 although rf modelling has overfitting issues fig s1 it provides a measure of variable importance for predicting smap sm biases in most cases smap sm biases are related to soil parameters i e soil moisture or temperature or both only six out of the total 42 cases are related only to vegetation parameters no important variables are picked up for eight cases the controlling factors of which might not be included in this study the selected factors in fig 8 generally consist of the best correlated factors in table 2 except for the yanco and mongolian sites ndvi is the major factor based on pearson s r for both sites whereas rf modelling selects soil temperature as the major factor for the yanco site and selects soil temperature bias as the major factor for the mongolian site this might be caused by multilinearities among variables in the former case ndvi is highly correlated with soil temperature r 0 64 and in the latter case ndvi bias is moderately r 0 36 correlated with soil temperature bias 4 discussion 4 1 preferred conditions and algorithms for smap sm retrieval all algorithms perform better under clear sky than cloudy sky and in clear days than nights and behave similarly in cloudy days and nights figs 4 5 as a result figs 1 2 show that p m retrievals not necessarily perform less good than a m retrievals similar results are reported in table 1 of yueh et al 2019 zhang et al 2019b also show lower ubrmse values for p m retrievals in cloudless days the dry biases of p m retrievals might be caused by soil moisture gradients in shallow soil layers this pattern also applies to a m retrievals because the preceding daytime sunlight has likely dried shallow soil layers for p m retrievals the heating of surface soil by sun might not be correctly accounted for in the gmao soil temperature data which also causes changes in sm biases the effects of rainfall events on smap sm retrievals have been reported in colliander et al 2020b wetter biases and degraded ubrmse values are also found in this study the v6 dca performs as good as sca v under cloudy sky and the v7 dca even shows the best performance under cloudy sky results not shown the new dca is expected to provide more accurate sm retrievals as it uses a regularization term to reduce noises inherent in the cost function o neill et al 2020 the simultaneous retrieval of vod and sm is another merit of dca for grassland and cropland with a low vegetation water content the intercepted rainwater might affect sm retrievals this can be accounted for by the retrieved vod which improves sm retrieval vegetation and soil temperature parameters are among the most important factors for smap sm retrieval the single channel algorithms are likely affected by vegetation biases for example the browning trend at the yanco site and the greening trend at the mongolian site are not captured by the respective ndvi climatology data fig 7 as a result sm biases are found to be correlated with vegetation parameters at these sites table 2 previous studies have widely addressed that single channel algorithms should be used with cautions over vegetated areas that have undergone substantial land surface changes fan et al 2020 walker et al 2019 zwieback et al 2018 although dca has the potential to improve sm retrievals it might underestimate vegetation optical depth in densely vegetated areas which results in an underestimation of sm fig 6 and table s2 recently gao et al 2021 have also reported the decrease of dca sm data quality with vegetation density in addition smap dca sm biases are positively correlated with soil temperature biases table 2 which underscores the importance of unbiased soil temperature data for future dca improvement gao et al 2020 4 2 complicated and interconnected causes of smap sm biases tracking smap sm biases is a difficult task a single factor explains at most 54 variance and nonlinear models only explain 50 80 variance fig s1 in sm biases the biases are jointly affected by soil moisture soil temperature vegetation parameters and probably other major factors unaccounted in this study soil moisture determines microwave penetration depth creating inconsistencies between satellite retrievals and in situ observations shellito et al 2016 the coupling of vegetation and soil temperature parameters further complicates the decomposition of sm biases generally vegetation condition and soil temperature are correlated and so are their biases land surface models generally use a static vegetation index climatology instead of applying a real time vegetation representation the modelled soil temperature data might have vegetation dependent biases because smap single channel algorithms also use ndvi climatology for sm retrieval the soil temperature biases and the vegetation biases are likely intercorrelated assuming a drought affected scenario an underestimation of soil temperature converts to an underestimation of sm and an overestimation of vegetation density converts to an overestimation of sm and a drying soil surface corresponds to a dry sm bias the net effects depend on the relative magnitude of each contributor based on radiative transfer equations sm bias should bear a nonlinear relationship with vegetation and soil temperature parameters and their first order derivatives it is unsurprising to see nonlinear rf models give better fitting results to determine major factors of sm biases the common strategy is to group sm biases by relevant parameters e g land cover type zhang et al 2019b climate zone ma et al 2019 vegetation index kim et al 2018 land surface temperature liu et al 2019 precipitation amount wu et al 2021 and season tavakol et al 2019 walker et al 2019 based on boxplots the general macroscopic pattern of sm bias and its dependence on spatial factors is revealed most of current validation studies focus on suggesting where and in what conditions satellite retrievals perform overall better relatively few studies are tackling seasonal dependence of sm biases in a quantitative manner dong et al 2018 zwieback et al 2018 these studies use triple collocation and probabilistic model to draw statistically significant conclusions our study offers a different perspective and directly investigates varied contributing factors to sm biases furthering the preliminary study by colliander et al 2019b such microscopic studies provide the opportunity to correct for smap sm biases 4 3 recommendations for microwave based sm validation practices validation of satellite based sm data should provide the opportunity to improve retrieval algorithms correlation analyses and rf modelling select important variables for sm biases both methods are an approximation of differentials of radiative transfer equation exploring the total differential of radiative transfer equation might provide a complete picture of sm biases and their dependence on individual factors this concept has been used in the visible and near infrared electromagnetic spectrum fan and liu 2014 and it is transferable to microwave electromagnetic spectrum for one reason the transfer process of microwave energy is well described and can be approximated by using analytical expressions wigneron et al 2017 for another reason vegetation and soil temperature biases are generally small which meets the precondition of differential equations the components of total differential equation can reveal the effects of which variables show the same signs or cancel each other sm validation should be supported by in situ observations over diverse landscapes in different phenological phases in this study most sites provide sm observations in vegetation growing seasons except for the remedhus and txson sites which provide temporally continuous sm observations the size of cloudy samples is further reduced much less for precipitating samples in addition these sites are distributed in temperate arid and semi arid regions with a low to moderate vegetation density leaving sm data in wet hilly and forested areas unvalidated since recent studies show the sensitivities of smap signals to soil moisture under forest canopies colliander et al 2020a ayres et al 2021 more observations in forested areas are needed to make the best use of l band microwave radiometry for sm retrieval 5 conclusions this study investigated the biases of 36 km smap v6 sm products and performed comprehensive attribution analyses based on seven core validation sites data overall the smap v6 baseline sca v outperforms dca and sca h with clear sky retrievals being consistently better than cloudy sky retrievals for each product the sm retrieval accuracy increases with the clear sky duration time and sm bias becomes wetter with the cloudy sky duration time due to a better performance in cloudless daytime than nighttime the p m retrievals are not necessarily less good than the a m retrievals the v6 dca performs comparably to sca v under cloudy sky and the v7 dca improves substantially and has the potential to provide optimal retrievals under cloudy sky soil temperature and vegetation parameters together with their biases impose a complicated impact on smap sm biases a single factor only explains at most 54 variance in the biases and random forest modelling reveals multiple nonlinear causes with a 50 80 interpretability because of the multicollinearities among multiple contributing factors smap sm biases should be reconsidered based on radiative transfer equations to this end more temporally continuous sm observations covering varied sites are needed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

retrieval requires both static slow varying or assumed unchanged and dynamic rapid changing variables most of which are provided as ancillary data and shared by sca and dca the two major dynamic variables are vegetation optical depth vod and effective soil temperature sca s use the 2000 2010 moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis normalized difference vegetation index ndvi climatology to calculate vod while dca simultaneously retrieves sm and vod both algorithms parameterize effective soil temperature based on the multilayered global modeling and assimilation office gmao soil temperature data chan et al 2016 a new parameterization scheme of effective soil temperature has been used in the smap v7 product o neill et al 2020 in the new scheme the correction factor k is revised depending on land cover types and the first soil layer is revised from 0 to 10 cm to 5 15 cm and the second layer is revised from 15 to 20 cm to 15 30 cm these dynamic variables and their biases might cause seasonally varying biases in smap sm retrievals colliander et al 2019b the accuracy of smap sm products varies depending on land use land cover types climate zones vegetation densities and other hydrothermal conditions al yaari et al 2019 ma et al 2019 zhang et al 2019b due to complexities of sm errors metrics values are generally categorized by the above factors to determine a general pattern the effects of dynamic variables have recently received increased attention especially for vegetation effects ebrahimi khusfi et al 2018 showed a stronger dependence of sm errors on vod than vegetation scattering albedo and soil roughness recommending the introduction of soil moisture and ocean salinity smos vod to improve smap sm retrieval ebrahimi et al 2018 kim et al 2018 and kumar et al 2018 found low errors over moderately vegetated areas independently whereas zhang et al 2019b reported low errors over sparsely vegetated areas regarding vegetation biases large smap sm biases have been found in areas where vegetation parameters deviate from climatological expectations e g in cropland areas colliander et al 2019a dong et al 2018 singh et al 2019 zwieback et al 2018 the resulting smap sm biases might impede seasonal comparison of sm dynamics dynamic variables also include soil temperature zhang et al 2019 showed that smap sm retrievals performed better in areas with higher land surface temperature colliander et al 2019b found a strong positive relationship between sm bias and soil temperature in a temperate and a cold cropland site regarding soil temperature biases however colliander et al 2019b found a moderate positive relationship only for the temperate site zhang et al 2019a reported that low biases in effective soil temperature resulted in underestimation of sm in high cold mountainous areas fan et al 2020 reported the similar underestimation issues over global vegetation disturbed areas the more underestimation of soil temperature the more underestimation of sm which is similar to the positive relationship in colliander et al 2019b over the permafrost qinghai tibet plateau area xing et al 2021 have recently showed that overestimation of smap sm retrievals can be partly explained by the overestimation of effective soil temperature soil wetness is an overall representation of land surface conditions based on the ismn dataset zhang et al 2019b reported a strong negative relationship between sm bias and soil wetness across all climate zones indicating an underestimation of smap enhanced sm based on sca v for wetter soils the same pattern has been also found in france el hajj et al 2018 india singh et al 2019 north america suman et al 2020 and northeast china lou et al 2019 however several core validation sites also show underestimation of sm for dry soils and overestimation of sm for wet soils e g the remedhus and yanco sites colliander et al 2017a soil wetness changes microwave penetration depths especially during the soil wetting and drying processes colliander et al 2020b reported wetter smap sm biases during rain events because smap senses the rainwater before it is propagating to the position of in situ sensors which indicates an overestimation of sm for wetter soils for the drying processes after rains the shallower smap penetration depth caused a shorter time a larger magnitude and a faster rate of soil drying as compared to in situ observations shellito et al 2016 overall soil wetness itself causes a complicated impact on smap sm retrieval dynamic soil wetness vegetation and soil temperature parameters all contribute to smap sm biases due to land surface complexities however conflicting conclusions on causal factors can be derived in addition most of current studies only validate the smap baseline sca v product leaving the sca h and dca has replaced sca v as baseline since smap sm v8 products poorly validated inspired by the recent work of colliander et al 2020b this study comprehensively evaluates time varying biases of smap sm products sca v sca h and dca in both ascending and descending orbits based on core validation sites data first the overall accuracy of sm products is evaluated then sm products are evaluated as per clear and cloudy sky conditions represented by cloud percentage information lastly linear and nonlinear models are developed to separate the contributions of varied dynamic variables to sm biases the results are expected to provide a new insight into the biases of smap sm products 2 methods and data processing 2 1 evaluating overall smap sm accuracy based on core validation sites data the smap in situ core validation site land surface parameters match up data version 1 include spatially and temporally matched smap sca h sca v and dca sm retrievals and in situ sm observations at globally distributed sites colliander et al 2017b providing a ready to use reference to evaluate multi scale smap sm retrievals colliander et al 2017a in this study we extracted the 36 km smap v6 sca h sm sca v sm dca sm gmao soil temperature tsurf in situ weighted average sm wasm and weighted soil temperature wast data at seven core validation sites including five cropland sites and two grassland sites table 1 these sites have enough data records within march 2016 december 2018 when global hourly cloud percentage data described below are available date time data quality flags and orbit number flagging a m or p m orbits were also extracted at each site the a m and p m orbit data were first separated by orbit number data were kept only if all three algorithms generated quality assured sm retrievals and the in situ reference pixel quality flag was valid although leading to a reduction in sample size this processing guarantees a fair comparison among different retrieval algorithms the final numbers of a m and p m orbits data records per site are shown in table 1 based on all sites data r bias and ubrmse values were calculated to characterize the overall performance of each product in both a m and p m orbits the spatial coverage of the txson site overlaps the smap 36 km grid centered at 30 5 n 98 5 w to evaluate possible improvements in the smap v7 product the new versions of smap sca h sca v and dca sm data and gmao soil temperature data were extracted at this site after data screening based on quality flags the common sample size shared by smap v6 and v7 products was 383 in a m orbit and was 352 in p m orbit the r bias and ubrmse values against in situ sm observations and the soil temperatures were compared between the two versions of products 2 2 evaluating weather effects on smap sm accuracy cloud coverage can reflect weather conditions which drive soil drying and wetting processes that are supposed to affect sm retrievals in this study we obtained the hourly 0 25 0 3125 merged global cloud percentage dataset from the nasa langley cloud and radiation center the dataset is derived based on the visible infrared solar infrared split window technique visst sist minnis et al 2011 supported by multiple geostationary satellite observations to form a global coverage cloud percentage ranges from 0 to 100 representing totally cloud free to fully cloud covered situations the data within 12 h before smap overpasses were extracted per site for each data record for a m retrievals cloud data started in the preceding 6p m and ended in 5 a m local time for p m retrievals cloud data started in 6 a m and ended in 5p m local time in the same day the nearest neighboring method was used for spatial match considering the similar coarse resolutions of cloud and sm data the weathers were classified as clear and cloudy based on cloud percentage values to include as many samples for a robust statistical analysis clear weathers were defined as having a cloud percentage 20 and cloudy weathers as having a cloud percentage 80 in each orbit all sites data were combined to examine the effects of clear sky or cloudy sky duration time on smap sm retrievals the clear sky or cloudy sky duration time 1 12 h was defined as the continuous hours of clear or cloudy skies before smap overpassing time in both conditions the r bias and ubrmse values were calculated at each time interval for all three algorithms in both orbits 2 3 modis vegetation data and vegetation biases smap uses modis ndvi climatology in its single channel algorithms effectively assuming no deviations in phenology evolution from its climatology the effects on sm retrievals were examined based on realistic ndvi data to this end the 16 day 5 km resolution terra and aqua modis ndvi datasets mod13c1 and myd13c1 were obtained with an equivalent 8 day resolution the combined ndvi dataset has largely reduced angular and cloud effects for each site the nearest modis 5 km grid was found and ndvi values were extracted for the 7 7 grids 35 km 35 km approximate to smap grid size centered on that grid all grids values fagged with good data or marginal data were kept and averaged time series ndvi values were obtained in a similar fashion and a spline interpolation method was used to derive daily ndvi values note that the peak and valley ndvi values were not recovered if the majority of original data were lacking the 1 km ancillary modis ndvi climatological data were obtained and were spatially aggregated to 36 km based on sites coordinates at each site daily vegetation biases were calculated by subtracting the realistic ndvi values from the climatological ndvi values a positive vegetation bias means an overestimation of vegetation effects and a negative vegetation bias means an underestimation both the realistic ndvi and ndvi bias values were extracted and calculated for all data records 2 4 investigating dominant factors for smap sm biases based on literature review dynamic influential factors of smap sm biases include soil wetness colliander et al 2020b vegetation density gao et al 2021 vegetation bias zwieback et al 2018 soil temperature zhang et al 2019b and soil temperature bias fan et al 2020 specifically in this study the factors were in situ soil moisture content ndvi ndvi bias climatological minus realistic in situ soil temperature and soil temperature bias gmao minus in situ two statistical approaches were used to quantify relationships between sm biases and these factors first pearson s correlation coefficients were calculated and the best correlated factor was determined second random forest rf models were developed predicting sm biases based on all factors both approaches were applied to a m and p m retrievals of all three algorithms at each site therefore a total of 42 groups three algorithms by two orbits by seven sites of data were analyzed for rf modelling the tree number was set as 200 and the leaf number was set as 5 the modelling processing was repeated for 200 times and each time uses randomly 80 samples for model training and the remaining for model validation the models outputs include r 2 total variance explained ubrmse and permutation based variable importance measures for each factor nicodemus et al 2010 these values were averaged after 200 times of rf modelling those factors having a variable importance measure value 1 huang et al 2013 were considered to be important for smap sm biases because rf models were used primarily to determine important factors the models parameters were assumed defaulted values and were not fine tuned 3 results 3 1 overall accuracy of smap sm retrievals based on all sites data smap v6 sca v and dca retrievals are almost unbiased in both a m and p m orbits and the sca h significantly underestimates sm fig 1 as the smap sm v6 baseline algorithm sca v performs the best followed by dca and sca h bias values differ among sites and between land cover types for the two grassland sites txson and mongolian site sca v retrievals are almost unbiased see txson site in fig 2 for the five cropland sites sca v sm bias values range between 0 067 and 0 033 cm3 cm 3 in a m orbit and between 0 074 and 0 036 cm3 cm 3 in p m orbit all algorithms perform better in p m orbit than in a m orbit which is contrary to the well known impression that a m retrievals outperform p m retrievals due to better soil canopy thermal equilibrium at the txson site reparameterization of effective soil temperature has led to more negative biases for smap v7 sm fig 3 bias values are decreased by 0 011 0 012 cm3 cm 3 0 013 0 014 cm3 cm 3 and 0 021 0 016 cm3 cm 3 in a m p m orbit respectively for sca h sca v and dca the mean decrease in soil temperature is 3 9 k in a m orbit and is 4 4 k in p m orbit the 4 k decrease in soil temperature converts to a decrease of 0 01 0 02 cm3 cm 3 in sm bias the v7 dca has a substantial improvement in all metrics based on the txson site data the new versions of sca h and sca v improve marginally in terms of r and ubrmse but both are subject to underestimations 3 2 diurnal weather effects on smap sm data quality it seems that clear skies benefit smap sm retrievals fig 4 and cloudy skies hamper smap sm retrievals fig 5 in terms of r and ubrmse similar to the overall validation results in fig 1 sca v also outperforms sca h and dca under clear skies however dca outperforms sca h and performs comparably to sca v under cloudy skies irrespective of clear or cloudy skies the effects of clear and cloudy sky duration time on smap sm retrievals are similar to each other for sca h sca v and dca regarding clear sky sca v retrievals r increases and ubrmse decreases with the duration time of clear skies especially in p m orbit the r and ubrmse values are consistently better than the corresponding overall values in fig 1 for a m retrievals the ubrmse values fall below 0 04 cm3 cm 3 if it is cloud free before 9p m last night for p m retrievals the ubrmse values are well below 0 04 cm3 cm 3 even if it is not clear up until smap overpasses the r values are above 0 90 if clear skies are kept throughout the afternoon the longer the sunshine duration time the better the smap sm retrievals under clear skies all algorithms show dry sm biases unlike clear sky retrievals no explicit patterns are found for cloudy sky retrievals in terms of r and ubrmse one important reason is that clouds can be precipitating or non precipitating which causes different impacts on smap sm retrievals despite this two findings can be obtained based on fig 5 first the r values 0 85 and ubrmse 0 05 cm3 cm 3 values are always less good than the corresponding overall values in fig 1 indicative of poorer algorithms performances in cloudy sky conditions second the wet sm biases become wetter with more cloudy sky duration time for all algorithms which might be attributed to precipitation the longer the cloudy sky duration time the higher the probability of precipitation events and the wetter the smap sm biases 3 3 dynamic controls on smap sm biases the major factors of smap sm biases depend on algorithms and sites table s1 s5 soil temperature and its bias are the dominant factors at the remedhus site for single channel algorithms sm bias correlates with soil wetness at the monte buey and txson sites positive for the former and negative for the latter vegetation parameters ndvi and its bias dominate smap sm biases at the yanco carman kenaston and mongolian sites table 2 at each site the major factors are similar for single channel algorithms and even in both orbits dca seems to be more affected by soil temperature biases followed by vegetation density general patterns of smap sm biases can be obtained from the statistical analyses table 2 and table s1 s5 sm bias is negatively correlated with soil temperature 5 6 in table 2 30 42 in table s3 indicative of drier sm biases for hotter soils the positive correlation between sm bias and soil temperature bias all 8 cases in table 2 and 35 42 in table s5 corroborates the decrease of sm bias with the decrease of soil temperature in table 2 sm bias is positively correlated with ndvi all 9 cases and its bias all five cases for single channel algorithms which means that a high or an overestimation of vegetation density might cause an overestimation of smap sca sm however sm bias is negatively correlated with ndvi for dca all 4 cases in table 2 and fig 6 indicating that dca might underestimate sm in densely vegetated areas 3 4 multifaceted influences on smap sm biases smap sm biases are jointly determined by multiple factors based on univariate correlation analyses results table s1 s5 none of the factors can explain 54 variance in sm biases taking the a m orbit sca v retrievals for an example fig 7 no single factors share a similar temporal pattern to smap sm biases which show large short term variabilities vegetation changes are generally slower and temporally more continuous than soil temperature and sm changes and the effects are basically smooth fig 6 and fig 7 the variabilities in smap sm biases might result from rapid changing soil temperatures and land surface conditions represented by soil moisture and other factors unaccounted the above speculation is validated by the variable importance measure results fig 8 although rf modelling has overfitting issues fig s1 it provides a measure of variable importance for predicting smap sm biases in most cases smap sm biases are related to soil parameters i e soil moisture or temperature or both only six out of the total 42 cases are related only to vegetation parameters no important variables are picked up for eight cases the controlling factors of which might not be included in this study the selected factors in fig 8 generally consist of the best correlated factors in table 2 except for the yanco and mongolian sites ndvi is the major factor based on pearson s r for both sites whereas rf modelling selects soil temperature as the major factor for the yanco site and selects soil temperature bias as the major factor for the mongolian site this might be caused by multilinearities among variables in the former case ndvi is highly correlated with soil temperature r 0 64 and in the latter case ndvi bias is moderately r 0 36 correlated with soil temperature bias 4 discussion 4 1 preferred conditions and algorithms for smap sm retrieval all algorithms perform better under clear sky than cloudy sky and in clear days than nights and behave similarly in cloudy days and nights figs 4 5 as a result figs 1 2 show that p m retrievals not necessarily perform less good than a m retrievals similar results are reported in table 1 of yueh et al 2019 zhang et al 2019b also show lower ubrmse values for p m retrievals in cloudless days the dry biases of p m retrievals might be caused by soil moisture gradients in shallow soil layers this pattern also applies to a m retrievals because the preceding daytime sunlight has likely dried shallow soil layers for p m retrievals the heating of surface soil by sun might not be correctly accounted for in the gmao soil temperature data which also causes changes in sm biases the effects of rainfall events on smap sm retrievals have been reported in colliander et al 2020b wetter biases and degraded ubrmse values are also found in this study the v6 dca performs as good as sca v under cloudy sky and the v7 dca even shows the best performance under cloudy sky results not shown the new dca is expected to provide more accurate sm retrievals as it uses a regularization term to reduce noises inherent in the cost function o neill et al 2020 the simultaneous retrieval of vod and sm is another merit of dca for grassland and cropland with a low vegetation water content the intercepted rainwater might affect sm retrievals this can be accounted for by the retrieved vod which improves sm retrieval vegetation and soil temperature parameters are among the most important factors for smap sm retrieval the single channel algorithms are likely affected by vegetation biases for example the browning trend at the yanco site and the greening trend at the mongolian site are not captured by the respective ndvi climatology data fig 7 as a result sm biases are found to be correlated with vegetation parameters at these sites table 2 previous studies have widely addressed that single channel algorithms should be used with cautions over vegetated areas that have undergone substantial land surface changes fan et al 2020 walker et al 2019 zwieback et al 2018 although dca has the potential to improve sm retrievals it might underestimate vegetation optical depth in densely vegetated areas which results in an underestimation of sm fig 6 and table s2 recently gao et al 2021 have also reported the decrease of dca sm data quality with vegetation density in addition smap dca sm biases are positively correlated with soil temperature biases table 2 which underscores the importance of unbiased soil temperature data for future dca improvement gao et al 2020 4 2 complicated and interconnected causes of smap sm biases tracking smap sm biases is a difficult task a single factor explains at most 54 variance and nonlinear models only explain 50 80 variance fig s1 in sm biases the biases are jointly affected by soil moisture soil temperature vegetation parameters and probably other major factors unaccounted in this study soil moisture determines microwave penetration depth creating inconsistencies between satellite retrievals and in situ observations shellito et al 2016 the coupling of vegetation and soil temperature parameters further complicates the decomposition of sm biases generally vegetation condition and soil temperature are correlated and so are their biases land surface models generally use a static vegetation index climatology instead of applying a real time vegetation representation the modelled soil temperature data might have vegetation dependent biases because smap single channel algorithms also use ndvi climatology for sm retrieval the soil temperature biases and the vegetation biases are likely intercorrelated assuming a drought affected scenario an underestimation of soil temperature converts to an underestimation of sm and an overestimation of vegetation density converts to an overestimation of sm and a drying soil surface corresponds to a dry sm bias the net effects depend on the relative magnitude of each contributor based on radiative transfer equations sm bias should bear a nonlinear relationship with vegetation and soil temperature parameters and their first order derivatives it is unsurprising to see nonlinear rf models give better fitting results to determine major factors of sm biases the common strategy is to group sm biases by relevant parameters e g land cover type zhang et al 2019b climate zone ma et al 2019 vegetation index kim et al 2018 land surface temperature liu et al 2019 precipitation amount wu et al 2021 and season tavakol et al 2019 walker et al 2019 based on boxplots the general macroscopic pattern of sm bias and its dependence on spatial factors is revealed most of current validation studies focus on suggesting where and in what conditions satellite retrievals perform overall better relatively few studies are tackling seasonal dependence of sm biases in a quantitative manner dong et al 2018 zwieback et al 2018 these studies use triple collocation and probabilistic model to draw statistically significant conclusions our study offers a different perspective and directly investigates varied contributing factors to sm biases furthering the preliminary study by colliander et al 2019b such microscopic studies provide the opportunity to correct for smap sm biases 4 3 recommendations for microwave based sm validation practices validation of satellite based sm data should provide the opportunity to improve retrieval algorithms correlation analyses and rf modelling select important variables for sm biases both methods are an approximation of differentials of radiative transfer equation exploring the total differential of radiative transfer equation might provide a complete picture of sm biases and their dependence on individual factors this concept has been used in the visible and near infrared electromagnetic spectrum fan and liu 2014 and it is transferable to microwave electromagnetic spectrum for one reason the transfer process of microwave energy is well described and can be approximated by using analytical expressions wigneron et al 2017 for another reason vegetation and soil temperature biases are generally small which meets the precondition of differential equations the components of total differential equation can reveal the effects of which variables show the same signs or cancel each other sm validation should be supported by in situ observations over diverse landscapes in different phenological phases in this study most sites provide sm observations in vegetation growing seasons except for the remedhus and txson sites which provide temporally continuous sm observations the size of cloudy samples is further reduced much less for precipitating samples in addition these sites are distributed in temperate arid and semi arid regions with a low to moderate vegetation density leaving sm data in wet hilly and forested areas unvalidated since recent studies show the sensitivities of smap signals to soil moisture under forest canopies colliander et al 2020a ayres et al 2021 more observations in forested areas are needed to make the best use of l band microwave radiometry for sm retrieval 5 conclusions this study investigated the biases of 36 km smap v6 sm products and performed comprehensive attribution analyses based on seven core validation sites data overall the smap v6 baseline sca v outperforms dca and sca h with clear sky retrievals being consistently better than cloudy sky retrievals for each product the sm retrieval accuracy increases with the clear sky duration time and sm bias becomes wetter with the cloudy sky duration time due to a better performance in cloudless daytime than nighttime the p m retrievals are not necessarily less good than the a m retrievals the v6 dca performs comparably to sca v under cloudy sky and the v7 dca improves substantially and has the potential to provide optimal retrievals under cloudy sky soil temperature and vegetation parameters together with their biases impose a complicated impact on smap sm biases a single factor only explains at most 54 variance in the biases and random forest modelling reveals multiple nonlinear causes with a 50 80 interpretability because of the multicollinearities among multiple contributing factors smap sm biases should be reconsidered based on radiative transfer equations to this end more temporally continuous sm observations covering varied sites are needed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

3241,the mobility and bioavailability of toxic arsenic as and cadmium cd in sediments are crucial to aquatic ecosystems while their geochemical transitions and spatiotemporal patterns associated with manganese mn iron fe sulfur s and salinity in a river estuary coast system are yet largely unexplained in this study seasonal field investigation and salinity dependent indoor experiments were combined using the diffusive gradients in thin films dgt technique to measure dgt labile species from the simultaneous river estuary coast interface the results revealed that as and fe presented a strong coupling for both dgt species and solid phases suggesting that as mobility was exclusively regulated under the redox transition of fe unlike other chemicals the relative enrichment of dgt labile cd in surface layers and the close affiliation between sediment cd fractions and organic carbon indicated that cd remobilization was largely associated with the aerobic decomposition of organic matter in addition the seasonal availability of as and cd tended to be influenced by terrigenous input and redox condition the indoor experiment results of an inconspicuous increase in dgt labile as and a steady increase in dgt labile cd with rising salinity confirm that the bioavailability of cd evidently increased with salinity gradient however the effect of salinity on as remained further debatable nevertheless a model simulation validated that this salinity dependent cd mobilization was suboptimal for sustaining a continuous cd resupply from the sediment to porewater particularly under limited labile cd pools therefore with expanding global marine hypoxia and sea level rising this study highlights that as and cd redox geochemistry in dynamic estuarine sediments should receive

sulfur s and salinity in a river estuary coast system are yet largely unexplained in this study seasonal field investigation and salinity dependent indoor experiments were combined using the diffusive gradients in thin films dgt technique to measure dgt labile species from the simultaneous river estuary coast interface the results revealed that as and fe presented a strong coupling for both dgt species and solid phases suggesting that as mobility was exclusively regulated under the redox transition of fe unlike other chemicals the relative enrichment of dgt labile cd in surface layers and the close affiliation between sediment cd fractions and organic carbon indicated that cd remobilization was largely associated with the aerobic decomposition of organic matter in addition the seasonal availability of as and cd tended to be influenced by terrigenous input and redox condition the indoor experiment results of an inconspicuous increase in dgt labile as and a steady increase in dgt labile cd with rising salinity confirm that the bioavailability of cd evidently increased with salinity gradient however the effect of salinity on as remained further debatable nevertheless a model simulation validated that this salinity dependent cd mobilization was suboptimal for sustaining a continuous cd resupply from the sediment to porewater particularly under limited labile cd pools therefore with expanding global marine hypoxia and sea level rising this study highlights that as and cd redox geochemistry in dynamic estuarine sediments should receive more attention considering their distinctly contrasting im mobilization kinetics keywords arsenic cadmium sediment water interface redox geochemistry salinity resupply kinetics 1 introduction arsenic as and cadmium cd are two of the most hypertoxic metal loid s and among the non essential elements for organisms which accumulate in plants and pose serious threats to both ecosystem and human health along the food chain williams et al 2005 zhang et al 2014 in particular the co contamination of as and cd in soils and sediments are common and serious threat to environment and human health e g via enrichment in rice and aquatic products fang et al 2014 irshad et al 2020 rahman et al 2012 compared with natural processes e g weathering anthropogenic activities such as mining fossil fuel combustion fertilizer use metal production and other agricultural or industrial practices have been more responsible for increasing as and cd levels in the environment williams et al 2005 zhao et al 2015 substantially polluted with several heavy metals hms estuaries are transition zones from river to sea and is a global problem due to unprecedented emissions as well as favorable augmentation conditions machado et al 2016 estuarine sediments are both major sinks and sources of hms due primarily to their potential role in the migration transformation and storage characteristics chen et al 2021 ianni et al 2010 understanding the geochemical behavior of hms during the early diagenesis of sediment is therefore compelling to predict their environmental fate i e sediment adsorption precipitation or desorption release into ambient waterbodies pan et al 2021 pan et al 2019b thus emphasizing to further assessing their residual geological and environmental impacts sediments are heterogeneous assemblages of numerous metal sorbing phases such as organic matter om hydr oxides sulfides carbonates and clay minerals whose abundance and distributions depend on ph redox conditions and the depositional environment particularly the hydrological regime for estuaries burton et al 2006 early diagenesis includes crucial processes involved in the geochemical transitions of many chemicals such as om mineralization influencing forms of iron fe manganese mn sulfur s as and cd in surface sediments gorny et al 2015 nameroff et al 2002 similar to phosphorus p as is rigorously competed for p adsorption sites sun et al 2017 and previous studies highlighted that as mobility in sediments is closely coupled with fe and or mn geochemistry bennett et al 2012 pan et al 2019b in estuarine and coastal environments terrigenous fe mn oxides may be the most important carriers for as in oxic sediments whereas as is weakly bound to particulate organic detritus sullivan and aller 1996 under anoxic conditions however the reduction and solubilization of fe mn oxides in turn have important consequences for the remobilization of as o day et al 2004 in addition reduction of as v into more toxic as iii by bacteria or sulfides also occurs near the zone of fe iii reduction this is followed by organic as s complexation or insoluble as fe s precipitates o day et al 2004 rochette et al 2000 resulting in different levels of mobilization or immobilization for as cd is primarily transported to estuarine and coastal sediments via physical and or chemical binding to terrigenous om or calcium carbonate particles burgay et al 2020 horner et al 2011 pan et al 2022 previous studies documented that sediment sulfides or fe mn oxides are believed to exert significant effects on cadmium sulfide precipitation or cd release sundby et al 2004 xu et al 2019 whilst cd could also primarily release into porewater by the aerobic oxidation of om nameroff et al 2002 scholz and neumann 2007 yet cd bioavailability is fundamentally unaffected by aqueous sulfide but is more connected with labile om chen et al 2021 piper and perkins 2004 to date the mechanisms that modulate the mobility and bioavailability of as and cd in sediments remains largely unexplored when subjected to spatially and temporally variable conditions in a dynamic estuarine environment the bioavailability and toxicity of hms to organisms are closely related to their presence as ionic species since organisms mainly take up free ions fang et al 2014 moreover to assess the mobility and bioavailability of redox sensitive elements performing high resolution and less disturbed sampling is imperative for heterogeneous sediments diffusive gradients in thin films dgt as an in situ sampling technique based on fick s first law of diffusion is compatible with above requirements davison and zhang 1994 the dgt measurement enrichment referred to as dgt labile chemicals comes from original porewater ions i e mn2 fe2 s2 cd2 and aso4 3 or aso3 3 and desorption resupply from labile solid fractions in the sediment zhang et al 1995 thus acting like biotic uptake the release resupply kinetics of hms from sediment to porewater during dgt deployment can be modelled and assessed by the dgt induced flux in sediments difs model to further characterize their bioavailability and im mobilization kinetics harper et al 2000 harper et al 1998 in recent years multiple dgt binding gels have been developed and employed in studies of both freshwater ecosystems and estuarine sediments for nutrients e g phosphorus pan et al 2020 pan et al 2019a and metal loid s especially as bennett et al 2012 sun et al 2016 and cd chen et al 2021 xu et al 2019 however high resolution field investigations of sediments in river estuary coast systems are infrequent especially centering on seasonal summer winter and or wet dry term variations moreover as and cd mobility and bioavailability may respond differently oppositely to redox conditions and relevant environmental factors necessitating a simultaneous analysis labile as and cd in aquatic sediments zhou et al 2020 it is worth considering that when salinity proportions from river to estuary increase some trace metals could be transformed into soluble chloride complexes particularly for cd comans and vandijk 1988 this results in a notable decline in free cd2 availability in porewater that is correspondent to increasing cd desorption from the sediment du laing et al 2009 in addition escalated salinity also boosts major cation and anion levels that compete with metals for the sorption sites in sediments or suspended particles leading to ion exchange and release of metals e g ca2 with cd2 breckel et al 2005 as well as sulfate and cl with as chakraborty et al 2012 gorny et al 2015 more importantly despite higher salinity augment hydro soluble cd levels the bioavailability or bioaccumulation could be subdued pedro et al 2013 zhong et al 2020 partly due to the less bioavailable cd cl complexes compared to free cd2 du laing et al 2009 at higher salinity levels however spontaneously formed cd complexes in porewater and labile particle cd in sediments may be desorbed to refill depleted unbound cd2 collected by dgt knowledge about the concentrations and resupply capacity of bioavailable cd and as by dgt decline incline entails further investigations in this work a combination of a seasonal field study in a river estuary coast system and salinity dependent indoor experiments leveraging dgt techniques were used to explore as and cd as well as related mn fe s and p redox geochemistry in sediment cores with high resolution therefore the objective of this work was 1 to examine the relationship between mn fe s redox geochemistry and as cd im mobilization 2 to elucidate the spatiotemporal patterns of bioavailable as cd and the underlying factors salinity terrigenous input and redox condition 3 to demonstrate the effects of salinity on the mobilization and bioavailability of as and cd in indoor experiments and 4 to assess the resupply kinetics of as and cd from sediments to porewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of study area xixi river is the largest river in xiamen city southeast china and in the meantime a small mountain river 34 km length with a catchment area of 320 km2 this region has a subtropical oceanic monsoon climate with a mean annual rainfall of 1500 mm most falling between april and september as shown in fig 1 six sampling sites were arranged in the downstream river xr 1 bordered by the city estuary xr 2 to xr 5 surrounded by an industrial park and coast xr 6 according to the water salinity table 1 due to the strong tides 2 6 m tidal range the estuary is relatively long approximately from xr 2 to xr 5 fig 1 and the hydrological characteristics of the estuary are seasonally controlled by runoff and tides 2 2 field sampling and preprocessing zro chelex dgt mixed binding gel of zr oxide and chelex specifically for adsorption of oxoanions as and cations mn fe and cd respectively and agi dgt a binding gel of agi specifically for s2 adsorption devices prepared according to xu et al 2013 and ding et al 2012 were used for field deployment the field sampling was conducted in june 2019 summer and the rainy season and december 2019 winter and the dry season during the low tide period the dgt devices 15 cm long and 4 cm wide were vertically inserted into the subtidal sediments at xr 6 to xr 1 sites at low tide on the second day a hollow pvc tube 8 cm in diameter and 40 cm long was carefully inserted into the sediment containing the dgt probes for both retrieving dgt and sampling the sediment core the samples were immediately transferred to the lab after sampling at all six sites during sampling a ysi professional plus was applied to measure the overlying water temperature salinity ph and dissolved oxygen do in addition a peeper sampler based on dialysis and diffusive equilibrium was inserted into the sediment near the dgt probes to collect the overlying water and porewater in different sampling seasons every sediment core from each site was parallel neighboring 1 m apart from the core in the previous season with a similar depositional environment the binding gel of zro chelex dgt was sliced into strips at 5 mm vertical intervals following the cleaning with deionized water in the laboratory the strips were subsequently eluted and processed according to the method of wang et al 2016 protocol for dgt labile mn fe cd as and p all the plasticware for processing and measurement of metal loid s were pre cleaned via acid pickling and rinsed with deionized water before use for dgt labile s analyses the binding gel of agi dgt was scanned canon 5600f scanner resolution of 600 dpi and pixel size of 0 042 mm 0 042 mm and the scanned images were converted to grayscale intensity with imagej 1 46 software widerlund and davison 2007 the surficial sediment 0 15 cm samples were immediately freeze dried at 80 c and later ground and sieved for further analysis 2 3 indoor experiments estuarine site xr 5 was selected to sample eight neighboring sediment cores by employing polymethyl methacrylate pmma tubes and the bottom of the core was sealed with a rubber stopper the river water was collected from xr 1 site eight undisturbed sediment cores were submerged in the same volume of river water and the salinity was adjusted by adding sea salt to 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 and 35 practical salinity unit psu however due to the salt difference between the sediments and the overlying water and their slow exchange it was difficult to accurately adjust the salinity after an equilibrium period of one week the salinities were 0 66 5 26 10 13 14 64 19 36 24 74 28 87 and 33 69 psu respectively finally the zro chelex dgt was inserted into each sediment for metal loid sampling the following operation was similar as reported in section 2 2 2 4 chemical analyses the dgt labile mn fe cd and as in the acidified elutes and water samples were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms agilent 7700x with germanium yttrium and indium as internal standards p in the elutes was quantified by miniaturized spectrophotometry methods based on an epoch microplate spectrophotometer bio tek winooski vt in sediment analyses the fresh samples were used for grain size measurement with a mastersizer 3000 malvern instruments ltd uk and the sieved samples were used for all other geochemical analyses the total carbon tc total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn and total sulfur ts were measured with a vario el iii element analyzer elementar germany the amorphous fe oxides fe ox were extracted with ascorbic acid solution rozan et al 2002 a modified european community bureau of reference bcr sequential extraction procedure was employed to extract metal loid fractions in the sediment including exchangeable and carbonate f1 reducible f2 oxidizable f3 and residual f4 fractions rauret et al 1999 collectively referred as the total metal loid content i e fe t or as t all the elutes for measurement of sediment metal loid fractions were acidified and determined by icp ms the methodology of utilizing blanks replicates and standard materials was adopted for quality control and quality assurance the standard materials were measured after every 10 or 20 samples since the determination of relative standard deviations rsds was negligible 1 triplicate analyses of c n and s contents were performed for each 10 or 20 samples all extraction procedure and icp ms measurements were performed in triplicate for as and cd the analytical detection limits of icp ms were 0 12 μg l 1 and 0 08 μg l 1 respectively the average recovery of the standard materials and rsds of the replicate samples analyses are listed in table s1 2 5 data processing the dgt labile s mass m s μg cm 2 accumulated in the binding gel was calculated using the established calibration curve equation 1 of grayscale density y versus m s x ding et al 2012 1 y 171 e x 7 23 220 the mass m μg of dgt labile mn fe cd and as was calculated by eq 2 2 m c e v f where c e is the detected concentration in the elute v is the elute volume and f is the elution efficiency wang et al 2017 the concentration of dgt labile chemicals c dgt was subsequently calculated according to equation 3 as reported previously zhang et al 1995 3 c d g t m δ g dat m s δ g dt where δg is the diffusive layer thickness 0 08 cm d is the temperature related diffusion coefficient cm2 s 1 wang et al 2016 a is the effective area of the gel strip 0 5 1 8 cm2 for the zro chelex dgt and t is the dgt deployment time for as and cd the adsorption desorption kinetics between sediment and porewater as well as the release resupply kinetics from sediment to porewater were simulated and evaluated by employing the dgt induced fluxes in sediments difs model the model is rooted in a pair of interlinked parabolic partial differential equations that describe the dissolved and adsorbed solid metal concentrations in the sediment and dgt system harper et al 2000 the input parameters were calculated by as and cd concentrations of dissolved c d detected by peeper dgt labile concentration c dgt and solid labile concentration c s i e the sum of fractions f1 f2 and f3 as well as the other sediment parameters harper et al 1998 the resupply coefficient r was defined as the ratio of dgt labile to dissolved concentration equation 4 where a higher value implies a stronger resupply capacity the distribution coefficient k d was computed as the ratio of solid labile concentration to dissolved concentration equation 5 with a higher value indicating an elevated labile metal content of potential resupply the particle concentration p c on the other hand was defined as the ratio of the weight of sediment solid phase to the volume of porewater using these input parameters the difs model can simulate the curves of r values with deployment time and the output parameter t c which is defined as the required time until the perturbed system reaches 63 of the equilibrium state both the adsorption and desorption rate constants i e k 1 and k 1 were calculated by following equations 6 and 7 with a larger value denoting that less time is required for the sediment to desorb adsorb to from porewater 4 r c d g t c d 5 k d c s c d 6 t c 1 k 1 k 1 7 k 1 k 1 k d p c 3 results 3 1 overlying water and solid sediment properties the overlying water salinity increased from river 0 1 to estuary 0 43 23 6 psu to coast 29 2 33 9 psu table 1 and fig 1 due to the decrease in rainfall and runoff in winter the salinity at estuarine sites is elevated compared that in summer the ph showed alkalescence ranging from 7 88 to 9 32 which basically decreased from xr 1 to xr 6 and was higher in winter than in summer the do concentration ranged from 2 20 to 6 16 mg l 1 with the highest value at xr 3 and the lowest at xr 6 both in summer the dissolved as concentration ranged from 1 72 to 5 40 μg l 1 without showing any apparent trend from river to coast while the dissolved cd concentration ranged from 3 53 to 6 71 μg l 1 with all relatively high values appearing at estuarine sites according to the grain size measurements the silt particles 4 64 μm were the major sediment components the tc and toc contents ranging from 0 52 to 2 10 were higher at river and estuarine sites xr 1 to xr 4 during both summer and winter and distinctly declined at coastal sites xr 5 and xr 6 indicating the terrigenous carbon transportation from river to coast similarly the c n ranged from 8 34 to 13 3 with a declining trend from river to coast during summer to winter season at coastal sites revealing mixed origin of the organics and receded terrigenous input in winter the highest ts content was found at xr 4 compared with lowest at xr 1 with values ranging from 1 10 to 6 90 g kg 1 respectively and the contents of metal loid fractions are presented in fig 2 except for an extremely higher f1 concentration at xr 5 in winter mn fractions roughly showed coherent tendencies with lowest at xr 4 and increasing to river and coast in both seasons specifically the f4 was the chief fraction followed by f1 and f2 with a negligible f3 portion it should be noted that the fe t content did not exhibit obvious variations between different sites however the fe ox content was highest at xr 3 and decreased from river to coast besides the f4 was the dominant fraction for as accounting for 78 96 of as t the distribution of as t content behavior as well as as f2 and fe ox resembles with fe t indicating a close linking relationship between fe and as the distribution and relative contents of cd fractions were considerably different from other metal loid s among them f1 was the dominant fraction for cd accounting for 53 79 of cd t except for the negligible f3 the distribution of other fractions and cd t was largely consistent with that of toc characterized by a marked decline at coastal sites 3 2 spatiotemporal distributions of dgt labile chemicals the depth profiles for concentrations of dgt labile chemical as cd fe mn and s in june and december are presented in figs 3 and 4 in the vertical distributions fe and mn showed agreement characterized by both minimal values in surface layers and apparent elevation at a certain depth followed by a continuous increase with occasional fall until the bottom more specifically the depth at which fe began to increase was deeper than that for mn with various levels in each profile alternatively s showed evident fluctuation especially in a high value area indicating an irregular pattern for individual profiles in this study as was found fairly similar to fe and mn with synchronous change and obvious vertical heterogeneity as such cd fractions were stable across the profiles with minor variability and a downward scheme along with the depths except for cd the vertical distribution of these dgt labile chemicals was different between summer and winter at most sites fig 5 shows the distributions of average values for dgt labile chemical concentrations in each profile in june the mn value was highest 0 85 mg l 1 at the coast lowest 0 07 mg l 1 in the river and moderate but variable in estuaries with radically inverse cd distribution ranging from 1 03 to 2 52 μg l 1 importantly the as distribution resembled that of fe with a maximum in estuaries xr 2 1 21 μg l 1 a moderate value 0 87 μg l 1 at the coast and a the lowest 0 46 μg l 1 in the river meanwhile the p distribution resemble with fe and as except for site xr 4 with comparatively higher concentrations moreover highest s value 0 52 mg l 1 was surprisingly observed at xr 4 moderate 0 2 mg l 1 at the coast and lowest 0 08 mg l 1 in the river in december a marked feature is that mn fe p and as appeared to show a significant increase in the river and a decrease at the coast whilst cd behaved in the opposite way as a result the difference between the six sites was tiny for cd values 1 82 2 02 μg l 1 in december the as distribution still resembled that of fe and p with an elevated value 0 80 μg l 1 in the river and a declining value 0 60 μg l 1 at the coast the s values at most of the sites was similar at both seasons 3 3 changes in dgt labile as cd fe and mn during indoor experiments the indoor experimental results unveiled that under varying salinity the vertical distributions for as cd fe and mn endured slight alterations between different profiles fig 6 the as values were in agreement with fe and particularly with mn in most profiles as featured by minimal values in the surface layers subsequently rising until the bottom or fluctuation with different degrees in contrary maximal cd values were recorded in the surface layers and a slight decline with depths in general all their vertical distributions resemble those of the field study yet there were noticeable changes in their profile averaged values among different salinities as shown in fig s1 with increasing salinity mn and fe concentrations generally increased with slight fluctuations as concentrations presented rule less but totally changes cd concentrations increased steady from s 0 to s 35 it was also verified by correlation analyses with significant positive linear correlation between cd mn and fe with salinity but nonsignificant correlation between as and salinity fig s2 3 4 resupply kinetics of as and cd evaluated by the difs model the input and output parameters of as and cd for the difs model are shown in table 2 for as the porewater concentrations c d ranged from 0 92 to 14 0 μg l 1 with a minimum at xr 1 in june which had the highest resupply coefficient r 0 31 and distribution coefficient k d 338 cm3 g 1 in contrast other r values were 0 15 and the k d values ranged from 39 to 322 cm3 g 1 in addition xr 1 in june also had the lowest t c value and the highest desorption rate constant k 1 and adsorption rate constant k 1 among all the sites for cd the porewater concentrations ranged from 2 3 to 7 0 μg l 1 with relatively high values appearing in the estuary r values were significantly higher than that of as ranging from 0 25 to 1 07 with the maximum appearing in the river and irregular changes in the estuary and at the coast the change in the k d value was generally in line with that of the r value in june while it showed a declining trend from river to coast in december two river sites held the noteworthy lowest t c value and highest k 1 and k 1 among all the sites 4 discussion 4 1 geo accumulation index igeo and pollution evaluation of as and cd as a single factor contaminant index i e the geo accumulation index i geo was applied to assess the pollution evaluation of sediment as and cd according to the following equation 8 müller 1969 8 i geo l o g 2 c i 1 5 b i where ci is the total content sum of f1 f2 f3 and f4 of sediment as and cd 1 5 is the background matrix correction factor and bi is the background value the regional geochemical baseline rgb and regional sediment background rsb cited from yan and zhao 1994 of as and cd are selected as background values respectively the calculation of rgb required a normalization method obtained from a correlation of contents between a conservative reference element e g fe lin et al 2012 and the element as and cd in the equation ramos miras et al 2011 as shown in table s2 i geo values 0 0 1 1 2 and 2 3 were classified as 0 1 2 and 3 grades corresponding to pollution classes of uncontaminated uncontaminated to moderately contaminated moderately contaminated and moderately contaminated to strongly contaminated respectively it is apparent that compared with non contaminated as cd exhibited sediment pollution to some extent especially when assessed according to rsb in addition the overlying water cd concentrations table 1 were close to or exceeded the different national and international guidelines e g epa cmc 2 μg l 1 set by the environmental protection agency 2006 who 3 μg l 1 set by the world health organization 2006 and the sea water quality standard grade ii 5 μg l 1 in china gb 3097 1997 in this study the cd pollution at estuarine sites was more serious in both sediments table s2 and fig 2 and overlying water table 1 the adjacent industrial park e g electroplate factories seems to be responsible for severe cd pollution although government supervision has been strengthened in recent years 4 2 geochemistry of mn fe and s the vertical distributions of dgt labile mn fe and s closely reflect the distribution patterns of mn2 fe2 and aqueous sulfide derived from both mn iii iv oxide reduction fe iii oxide reduction and sulfate reduction respectively lovley and phillips 1988 pan et al 2021 following the aerobic respiration and denitrification mn fe reduction and the production of dgt labile mn fe serve as intermediaries linking aerobic and anaerobic sulfidic conditions overall xr 4 was merely the exceptional site where both dgt labile mn and fe concentrations were negligible throughout nearly all the profiles accompanied by enriched dgt labile s figs 3 and 4 moreover xr 4 was the only sampling site with malodorous black sediment in the field featuring high toc and ts and low solid mn and fe contents table 1 and fig 2 which may be connected to anthropogenic pollution this indicates that intense sulfate reduction dominates om mineralization under the thoroughly anoxic conditions therefore intense sulfate reduction may occur in subsurface layers on top of the mn fe reduction layers particularly for xr 2 and xr 3 in fig 4 which is generally attributed to locally reactive om contents muyzer and stams 2008 in both summer and winter seasons the variation in the pattern of dgt labile mn fe and s from river to estuary to coast is irregular which should be related to different and complex depositional environments and associated with changing redox conditions organic matter and mn fe oxide availability burton et al 2006 nevertheless in some cases regular seasonal variations in the vertical profiles of mn fe and s are evident apparently corresponding to non steady state pattern in diagenetic profiles e g the subsurface enrichment of dgt labile s at xr 2 and xr 3 in december following extensive sediment reworking during changing river flow and tides sullivan and aller 1996 alterations in om were largely proved as the crucial factor controlling seasonal changes in redox conditions as well as the mn fe and s cycling this was in turn allied with increased toc contents that was resulted decreased aerobic depth and locally increased dgt labile mn fe and s concentrations in river sites xr 1 xr 2 and xr 3 nevertheless the toc contents were decreased in accordance with apparently increased aerobic depth and decreased dgt labile mn fe and s concentrations in coastal sites xr 4 xr 5 and xr 6 fig 5 the change in toc contents may be attributed to changes in rainfall and runoff induced terrigenous input during a droughty winter the hypoactive runoff has a limited capacity to transport materials to the ocean leading to accumulation of major chemicals e g c and fe in river sites and lower supply at coastal sites evidenced by decreased c n with receded terrigenous organics input in winter 4 3 mobility of as and the underlying factors in sediment and porewater coupled reductive dissolution of fe iii hydr oxides and mobilization of as has been observed in many studies bennett et al 2012 chakraborty et al 2012 sun et al 2016 although their decoupling has also been reported pan et al 2019b in the current study the linear correlations and cluster analyses fig 7 revealed a profound positive correlation and a close relationship between sediment fe and as e g fe t and as t fe ox and as f2 proving that as and fe have similar origins and that the reducible as is principally bound to fe oxides overall the dgt labile as and fe presented consistent distributions and significant positive correlations in nearly all vertical profiles table s3 variations in profile averaged fe and as values from river to estuaries to coast in both summer and winter were also quite in agreement with each other fig 5 and fig s3 these profiles illustrated a robust redox coupling of as with fe whereby as was primarily associated with solid fe hydr oxides in surface oxic sediments then they are synchronously reduced and released into the extensive anoxic porewater sullivan and aller 1996 and the relative abundances of remobilized as and fe are stable in different profiles upon spatiotemporal changes alternatively the distribution of p was also identical to fe and as denoting that p transport was also greatly influenced by the fe redox cycle in particular both p and as occupied similar adsorption sites on fe hydr oxides it is vital to assess that exceeding p concentrations 0 2 mg l 1 may perceptibly compete with as for the surface sites resulting in enhanced as release sun et al 2017 therefore this work uncovered covaried distributions of the dissolved p and as was found in this work except for highly sulfurized xr 4 which endorses p mobility with concomitant as scavenging although the vertical distributions of dgt labile as and mn were also mainly consistent table s3 their changes in average values and related solid contents in sediments were discrepant hence compared with fe the mn geochemistry was not the leading operative for modulating the as mobility consistently the non negative correlation between dgt labile as and s indicated that the presence of aqueous sulfide could not appreciably immobilize as table s3 another prevalent scenario was the xr 4 site with highly sulfidic conditions where dgt labile as concentrations were not exclusively negligible as labile fe particularly in december fig 4 it seems that the microbially mediated and sulfide induced as v reduction to as iii has not been adsorbed precipitated in sulfurized environments via multiple potential pathways involving organic complexation and generation of as s or as fe s precipitates rochette et al 2000 a recent study has confirmed that as mobilization was highly correlated with biogenic sulfide and that moderate thiolation of as can facilitate as release ye et al 2020 the pattern of dgt labile as variation from the river to estuary to coast was also irregular resembling fe as the complex depositional environment and redox associated availability of the sediment as pool whilst a change in toc content and c n controls the seasonal changes in dgt labile as by affecting fe redox cycling this demonstrates that although the mechanisms responsible for as mobility are multiple and changing in a complex river estuary coast environment terrigenous input organic matter and induced redox changes are crucial factors controlling the seasonal availability of as in surface sediments 4 4 mobility of cd and the underlying factors unlike as fe mn and s with apparent redox sensitive distributions dgt labile cd was rather stable throughout the profile with little fluctuation figs 3 and 4 as shown in table s3 and fig 5 the correlations of cd with fe mn and s are uncorrelated or negative in vertical profiles the results indicated that fe mn oxides were incompetent in exerting noteworthy implications on transporting consequently liberating cd in these sediments unexpectedly the sulfide had a non negligible effect on the solidification and immobilization of cd even at highly sulfidic conditions in xr 4 it is known that the incorporation of trace metal loid s into pyrite was recognized as the most intense for as but little to negligible for cd scholz and neumann 2007 although cd may form insoluble cadmium sulfide cds precipitates in the presence of aqueous sulfide its rate of enrichment was not necessarily controlled by the amount of sulfide availability sundby et al 2004 primarily in the presence of more thiophilic fe according to a previous study cd behavior was particularly associated with labile om and was largely unaffected by aqueous sulfide in porewater piper and perkins 2004 it is worth noting that dgt labile cd presented a slightly declining trend with depth confirming a of relative enrichment schemes in surface oxic layers and deficiency in deep anoxic layers a recent study described that cd contents in the estuarine and coastal sediments could be strongly regulated by the terrigenous inputs burgay et al 2020 also as the aerobic mineralization is widely accepted to be significantly faster than anaerobic mineralization irrespective of the degree of lability of the om dauwe et al 2001 de beer et al 2005 winkler et al 2019 thereby it was likely to comprehend that cd remobilization was largely bound with om decomposition in oxic sediments as shown in fig 7 a significant positive correlation and close relationship was observed between sediment cd cd f1 cd f2 and cd t and carbon tc and toc but not total inorganic carbon unravelling that cd was chiefly derived from om rather by authigenic carbonates this could be complimented owing to a similar ionic radius to a calcium ion cd can be taken up by several marine organisms through their ca ion pumps merian et al 2004 creating an enrichment of cd within the biogenic calcareous debris ciaralli et al 1998 ianni et al 2010 cd can also be fixed by phytoplankton and remobilized via aerobic degradation of the deposited om at the sediment surface gendron et al 1986 scholz and neumann 2007 another study also confirmed that cd is primarily released to sediment porewater by decomposition of om nameroff et al 2002 in addition cd is known to have a great affinity with carbonates carbon dioxide in the sediment is produced primarily by the aerobic breakdown of om or by anaerobic methanogenesis which can amplify the release of metal ions via decalcification du laing et al 2009 overall all these cases were associated with om decomposition and lead to a relatively higher cd availability in surface oxic sediments for spatiotemporal variation dgt labile cd presented different patterns in summer highest in xr 1 and lowest in xr 6 and winter little difference among all sites in fig 5 this variation can be ascribed by spatiotemporal differences in oxic depth as well as cd and toc availability in sediments in summer the oxic depth is consistent with dgt labile cd concentrations decreasing from river to estuary to coast further the xr 6 site held the lowest cd fractions and toc contents which is unfavorable for cd mobilization in winter the oxic depth got shallower in the river sites and deeper in the coastal sites owing to changed terrigenous material input as discussed above hence dgt labile cd concentrations decreased in the river sites and increased in the coastal sites in addition the sorbents were relatively ineffective at adsorbing cd due to close competition with mg and ca in particular under high salinity and non sulfidic conditions breckel et al 2005 which was beneficial for cd mobilization in the coastal site as discussed in section 4 5 against the low sediment cd background in contrast to the positive correlation between fe and as both mn and cd showed significant negative correlations particularly for their profile averaged values fig s3 actually the direct adverse contribution of mn geochemistry on cd mobility was not expected also the beginning of mn reduction functioned as a gateway betweenlinking aerobic and anaerobic sulfidic conditions this was further verified that a higher dgt labile mn concentration was generally connected with more anoxic conditions and a shallower oxic depth as also verified in this study ensuing limited cd mobility 4 5 salinity dependent mobilization of as and cd since the origin and treatment of the sediment cores was identical vertical distributions of dgt labile fe mn as and cd showed minimal deviations between different profiles fig 6 however the oxic depth reflected by the fe profile herein and mn fe reduction seems to become shallower and stronger with salinity gradient respectively fig s1 a previous study also found that iron reduction appeared to be enhanced during om oxidation after the salinity intrusion explained by the increasing ionic strength and decreasing ph in porewater which increase the available surface area of the fe iii oxide pool in these sediments weston et al 2006 nevertheless dgt labile as presented a subtle and irregular increase with salinity gradient though its vertical distributions were controlled by fe mn redox cycles table s4 thereupon the contribution of rising salinity on as mobility and bioavailability remains further debatable in contrast to oxoanions e g as the mechanism of cation e g cd mobility with increasing salinity is clear in this process cd can be transformed to soluble chloride complexes comans and vandijk 1988 preventing the bioavailability of free cd2 in porewater and increasing cd desorption from the sediment du laing et al 2009 in addition the increasing concentrations of major cations e g ca2 can compete with cd for the sorption sites inducing ion exchange and thus cd release breckel et al 2005 in the meantime the comparable results for dgt labile cd was also observed in the indoor experiments fig s1 featuring sustained elevation with salinity gradient however although the concentrations of hydro soluble cd are widely accepted to increase with salinity cd bioavailability or bioaccumulation have been reported to decrease pedro et al 2013 zhong et al 2020 partly due to the less bioavailable cd cl complexes compared to free cd2 du laing et al 2009 in the current study it was confirmed that the bioavailability and bioaccumulation of cd as evaluated by dgt clearly increase with salinity gradient which indicates that the newly formed cd cl complexes in porewater and labile particle cd in sediments tend to desorb and resupply the lost free cd2 captured by dgt in highly saline estuarine and coastal environments the results of salinity dependent experiment imply that the as and cd cycles in land ocean transition regions undergo various alterations to respond the rapid global change such as sea level rising induced saline intrusion 4 6 kinetic exchange of as and cd between sediments and porewater the difs model can simulate output parameters characterizing the adsorption desorption capacity of as and cd between sediment and porewater table 2 as well as can generate the r curves with deployment time fig 8 the initial rises in r curves are reflections of the establishment of a diffusive gradient at the very beginning concerned with the rates of diffusion in the sediment porewater ernstberger et al 2005 on the contrary the following declines were more dependent on the sediment labile pool with the remaining constant r curves pointing to the adequate supply of metals from the solid phase ernstberger et al 2005 for as in this study only xr 1 in june had a relatively high r value and an almost constant r curve with time after the establishment of the diffusive gradient in accordance with the highest k d k 1 k 1 and fastest t c this also proposed that the response time and time to reach equilibrium between adsorption and desorption processes for sediment and porewater were fastest together with the highest distribution coefficient i e resupply potential which was conducive for sustaining a sufficiently stable r value with time additionally all other sites showed either a weak resupply capacity low r or a weak resupply potential low k d in accordance with a slow adsorption and desorption response causing a continuous decrease in the r value without reaching equilibrium for xr 1 in december the subdued resupply capacity and potential of as should be associated with redox dependent as mobility moreover the enhanced fe reduction triggered further as mobilization and release to porewater in an anoxic environment therefore weakening r and k d obviously the kinetic exchange between sediment and porewater for cd was complicated and changeable as shown in table 2 the highest r and k d value due to the lowest cd concentrations also appear at xr 1 in both summer and winter accompanied by a noteworthy lowest t c value and highest k 1 and k 1 this suggests a significant rapid adsorption and desorption response which can continuously resupply cd with strong capacity r from sediment to porewater leading to consumption of the labile cd pool over time especially within a moderate solid cd background fig 2 this is why r values in the curve keep decreasing with time fig 8 in contrast xr 6 had the lowest r value in summer and lowest k d values in both summer and winter due to a relatively high c d concentration which represent a non steady state of weak and lackluster resupply featuring both low and decreasing r values with time apparently high salinity dependent cd mobilization at a coastal site is unfavorable for continuous resupply which leads to compromised resupply potential of the sediment particularly under exhausted labile cd pool fig 2 estuarine zones on the other hand falls between river and coastal sites featuring moderate r k d t c k 1 and k 1 values consequently r remained approximately constant after the establishment of a diffusive gradient indicating a steady state of stable resupply which is rigorously tied with an adequate labile cd pool fig 2 overall the difs model simulation indicates that a moderate resupply coefficient coupled with an adequate distribution coefficient and a labile pool are beneficial for sustaining a continuous and stable resupply of as and cd from surface sediments fluctuations in redox conditions and the associated as mobility is principally responsible for the seasonal change in as resupply capacity whereas the salinity dependent cd mobilization and the labile cd pool availability have greater responsibility for cd resupply capacity and potential 5 conclusions imaging the high resolution spatiotemporal distributions of dgt labile chemicals provided detailed insights into the vertical profile and seasonal as and cd mobility in dynamic sediments from the river to estuary to coast interface compared with non contaminating as cd exhibited sediment and overlying water pollution particularly at estuarine sites the pattern of variation in dgt labile mn fe and s from the river to estuary to coast was irregular due to complicated depositional environments while the shifts in om were emerged as the key factor controlling seasonal changes in redox conditions and thereby fostering mn fe and s cycling as and fe presented tight coupling for spatiotemporal distributions of both dgt species and solid phases reflecting a tight redox coupling of as with fe whereby as was primarily associated with solid fe hydr oxides in surface oxic sediments then synchronous reduction and release into the extensive anoxic porewater unlike other chemicals dgt labile cd showed a moderate decrease in the vertical profile and sediment cd fractions were closely connected with organic carbon indicating that cd remobilization was largely associated with aerobic decomposition of om besides its seasonal variation was attributed to spatiotemporal differences in oxic depth and cd and toc availability in sediments the results of the salinity related indoor experiments illustrated that the effect of rising salinity on as mobility and bioavailability was undefined which seemed not to be entirely associated with fe mn cycles whilst cd mobilization clearly increases with salinity gradient possibly due to increased desorption and resupply from cd complexes and sediment the difs model simulation indicates that the salinity dependent cd mobilization and labile cd pool availability are crucial for cd resupply capacity and potential it was worth noting that the redox condition and im mobilization kinetics responsible for as and cd mobility were completely opposite with oxic conditions favoring om decomposition and cd remobilization but as immobilization by sediment meanwhile the anoxic conditions promoted om and cd burial although as remobilization was associated with fe mn oxides reduction therefore as and cd redox geochemistry in the sediment water interface should attain more attention when subjected to spatially and temporally variable conditions in dynamic

3241,the mobility and bioavailability of toxic arsenic as and cadmium cd in sediments are crucial to aquatic ecosystems while their geochemical transitions and spatiotemporal patterns associated with manganese mn iron fe sulfur s and salinity in a river estuary coast system are yet largely unexplained in this study seasonal field investigation and salinity dependent indoor experiments were combined using the diffusive gradients in thin films dgt technique to measure dgt labile species from the simultaneous river estuary coast interface the results revealed that as and fe presented a strong coupling for both dgt species and solid phases suggesting that as mobility was exclusively regulated under the redox transition of fe unlike other chemicals the relative enrichment of dgt labile cd in surface layers and the close affiliation between sediment cd fractions and organic carbon indicated that cd remobilization was largely associated with the aerobic decomposition of organic matter in addition the seasonal availability of as and cd tended to be influenced by terrigenous input and redox condition the indoor experiment results of an inconspicuous increase in dgt labile as and a steady increase in dgt labile cd with rising salinity confirm that the bioavailability of cd evidently increased with salinity gradient however the effect of salinity on as remained further debatable nevertheless a model simulation validated that this salinity dependent cd mobilization was suboptimal for sustaining a continuous cd resupply from the sediment to porewater particularly under limited labile cd pools therefore with expanding global marine hypoxia and sea level rising this study highlights that as and cd redox geochemistry in dynamic estuarine sediments should receive

their distinctly contrasting im mobilization kinetics keywords arsenic cadmium sediment water interface redox geochemistry salinity resupply kinetics 1 introduction arsenic as and cadmium cd are two of the most hypertoxic metal loid s and among the non essential elements for organisms which accumulate in plants and pose serious threats to both ecosystem and human health along the food chain williams et al 2005 zhang et al 2014 in particular the co contamination of as and cd in soils and sediments are common and serious threat to environment and human health e g via enrichment in rice and aquatic products fang et al 2014 irshad et al 2020 rahman et al 2012 compared with natural processes e g weathering anthropogenic activities such as mining fossil fuel combustion fertilizer use metal production and other agricultural or industrial practices have been more responsible for increasing as and cd levels in the environment williams et al 2005 zhao et al 2015 substantially polluted with several heavy metals hms estuaries are transition zones from river to sea and is a global problem due to unprecedented emissions as well as favorable augmentation conditions machado et al 2016 estuarine sediments are both major sinks and sources of hms due primarily to their potential role in the migration transformation and storage characteristics chen et al 2021 ianni et al 2010 understanding the geochemical behavior of hms during the early diagenesis of sediment is therefore compelling to predict their environmental fate i e sediment adsorption precipitation or desorption release into ambient waterbodies pan et al 2021 pan et al 2019b thus emphasizing to further assessing their residual geological and environmental impacts sediments are heterogeneous assemblages of numerous metal sorbing phases such as organic matter om hydr oxides sulfides carbonates and clay minerals whose abundance and distributions depend on ph redox conditions and the depositional environment particularly the hydrological regime for estuaries burton et al 2006 early diagenesis includes crucial processes involved in the geochemical transitions of many chemicals such as om mineralization influencing forms of iron fe manganese mn sulfur s as and cd in surface sediments gorny et al 2015 nameroff et al 2002 similar to phosphorus p as is rigorously competed for p adsorption sites sun et al 2017 and previous studies highlighted that as mobility in sediments is closely coupled with fe and or mn geochemistry bennett et al 2012 pan et al 2019b in estuarine and coastal environments terrigenous fe mn oxides may be the most important carriers for as in oxic sediments whereas as is weakly bound to particulate organic detritus sullivan and aller 1996 under anoxic conditions however the reduction and solubilization of fe mn oxides in turn have important consequences for the remobilization of as o day et al 2004 in addition reduction of as v into more toxic as iii by bacteria or sulfides also occurs near the zone of fe iii reduction this is followed by organic as s complexation or insoluble as fe s precipitates o day et al 2004 rochette et al 2000 resulting in different levels of mobilization or immobilization for as cd is primarily transported to estuarine and coastal sediments via physical and or chemical binding to terrigenous om or calcium carbonate particles burgay et al 2020 horner et al 2011 pan et al 2022 previous studies documented that sediment sulfides or fe mn oxides are believed to exert significant effects on cadmium sulfide precipitation or cd release sundby et al 2004 xu et al 2019 whilst cd could also primarily release into porewater by the aerobic oxidation of om nameroff et al 2002 scholz and neumann 2007 yet cd bioavailability is fundamentally unaffected by aqueous sulfide but is more connected with labile om chen et al 2021 piper and perkins 2004 to date the mechanisms that modulate the mobility and bioavailability of as and cd in sediments remains largely unexplored when subjected to spatially and temporally variable conditions in a dynamic estuarine environment the bioavailability and toxicity of hms to organisms are closely related to their presence as ionic species since organisms mainly take up free ions fang et al 2014 moreover to assess the mobility and bioavailability of redox sensitive elements performing high resolution and less disturbed sampling is imperative for heterogeneous sediments diffusive gradients in thin films dgt as an in situ sampling technique based on fick s first law of diffusion is compatible with above requirements davison and zhang 1994 the dgt measurement enrichment referred to as dgt labile chemicals comes from original porewater ions i e mn2 fe2 s2 cd2 and aso4 3 or aso3 3 and desorption resupply from labile solid fractions in the sediment zhang et al 1995 thus acting like biotic uptake the release resupply kinetics of hms from sediment to porewater during dgt deployment can be modelled and assessed by the dgt induced flux in sediments difs model to further characterize their bioavailability and im mobilization kinetics harper et al 2000 harper et al 1998 in recent years multiple dgt binding gels have been developed and employed in studies of both freshwater ecosystems and estuarine sediments for nutrients e g phosphorus pan et al 2020 pan et al 2019a and metal loid s especially as bennett et al 2012 sun et al 2016 and cd chen et al 2021 xu et al 2019 however high resolution field investigations of sediments in river estuary coast systems are infrequent especially centering on seasonal summer winter and or wet dry term variations moreover as and cd mobility and bioavailability may respond differently oppositely to redox conditions and relevant environmental factors necessitating a simultaneous analysis labile as and cd in aquatic sediments zhou et al 2020 it is worth considering that when salinity proportions from river to estuary increase some trace metals could be transformed into soluble chloride complexes particularly for cd comans and vandijk 1988 this results in a notable decline in free cd2 availability in porewater that is correspondent to increasing cd desorption from the sediment du laing et al 2009 in addition escalated salinity also boosts major cation and anion levels that compete with metals for the sorption sites in sediments or suspended particles leading to ion exchange and release of metals e g ca2 with cd2 breckel et al 2005 as well as sulfate and cl with as chakraborty et al 2012 gorny et al 2015 more importantly despite higher salinity augment hydro soluble cd levels the bioavailability or bioaccumulation could be subdued pedro et al 2013 zhong et al 2020 partly due to the less bioavailable cd cl complexes compared to free cd2 du laing et al 2009 at higher salinity levels however spontaneously formed cd complexes in porewater and labile particle cd in sediments may be desorbed to refill depleted unbound cd2 collected by dgt knowledge about the concentrations and resupply capacity of bioavailable cd and as by dgt decline incline entails further investigations in this work a combination of a seasonal field study in a river estuary coast system and salinity dependent indoor experiments leveraging dgt techniques were used to explore as and cd as well as related mn fe s and p redox geochemistry in sediment cores with high resolution therefore the objective of this work was 1 to examine the relationship between mn fe s redox geochemistry and as cd im mobilization 2 to elucidate the spatiotemporal patterns of bioavailable as cd and the underlying factors salinity terrigenous input and redox condition 3 to demonstrate the effects of salinity on the mobilization and bioavailability of as and cd in indoor experiments and 4 to assess the resupply kinetics of as and cd from sediments to porewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of study area xixi river is the largest river in xiamen city southeast china and in the meantime a small mountain river 34 km length with a catchment area of 320 km2 this region has a subtropical oceanic monsoon climate with a mean annual rainfall of 1500 mm most falling between april and september as shown in fig 1 six sampling sites were arranged in the downstream river xr 1 bordered by the city estuary xr 2 to xr 5 surrounded by an industrial park and coast xr 6 according to the water salinity table 1 due to the strong tides 2 6 m tidal range the estuary is relatively long approximately from xr 2 to xr 5 fig 1 and the hydrological characteristics of the estuary are seasonally controlled by runoff and tides 2 2 field sampling and preprocessing zro chelex dgt mixed binding gel of zr oxide and chelex specifically for adsorption of oxoanions as and cations mn fe and cd respectively and agi dgt a binding gel of agi specifically for s2 adsorption devices prepared according to xu et al 2013 and ding et al 2012 were used for field deployment the field sampling was conducted in june 2019 summer and the rainy season and december 2019 winter and the dry season during the low tide period the dgt devices 15 cm long and 4 cm wide were vertically inserted into the subtidal sediments at xr 6 to xr 1 sites at low tide on the second day a hollow pvc tube 8 cm in diameter and 40 cm long was carefully inserted into the sediment containing the dgt probes for both retrieving dgt and sampling the sediment core the samples were immediately transferred to the lab after sampling at all six sites during sampling a ysi professional plus was applied to measure the overlying water temperature salinity ph and dissolved oxygen do in addition a peeper sampler based on dialysis and diffusive equilibrium was inserted into the sediment near the dgt probes to collect the overlying water and porewater in different sampling seasons every sediment core from each site was parallel neighboring 1 m apart from the core in the previous season with a similar depositional environment the binding gel of zro chelex dgt was sliced into strips at 5 mm vertical intervals following the cleaning with deionized water in the laboratory the strips were subsequently eluted and processed according to the method of wang et al 2016 protocol for dgt labile mn fe cd as and p all the plasticware for processing and measurement of metal loid s were pre cleaned via acid pickling and rinsed with deionized water before use for dgt labile s analyses the binding gel of agi dgt was scanned canon 5600f scanner resolution of 600 dpi and pixel size of 0 042 mm 0 042 mm and the scanned images were converted to grayscale intensity with imagej 1 46 software widerlund and davison 2007 the surficial sediment 0 15 cm samples were immediately freeze dried at 80 c and later ground and sieved for further analysis 2 3 indoor experiments estuarine site xr 5 was selected to sample eight neighboring sediment cores by employing polymethyl methacrylate pmma tubes and the bottom of the core was sealed with a rubber stopper the river water was collected from xr 1 site eight undisturbed sediment cores were submerged in the same volume of river water and the salinity was adjusted by adding sea salt to 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 and 35 practical salinity unit psu however due to the salt difference between the sediments and the overlying water and their slow exchange it was difficult to accurately adjust the salinity after an equilibrium period of one week the salinities were 0 66 5 26 10 13 14 64 19 36 24 74 28 87 and 33 69 psu respectively finally the zro chelex dgt was inserted into each sediment for metal loid sampling the following operation was similar as reported in section 2 2 2 4 chemical

total nitrogen tn and total sulfur ts were measured with a vario el iii element analyzer elementar germany the amorphous fe oxides fe ox were extracted with ascorbic acid solution rozan et al 2002 a modified european community bureau of reference bcr sequential extraction procedure was employed to extract metal loid fractions in the sediment including exchangeable and carbonate f1 reducible f2 oxidizable f3 and residual f4 fractions rauret et al 1999 collectively referred as the total metal loid content i e fe t or as t all the elutes for measurement of sediment metal loid fractions were acidified and determined by icp ms the methodology of utilizing blanks replicates and standard materials was adopted for quality control and quality assurance the standard materials were measured after every 10 or 20 samples since the determination of relative standard deviations rsds was negligible 1 triplicate analyses of c n and s contents were performed for each 10 or 20 samples all extraction procedure and icp ms measurements were performed in triplicate for as and cd the analytical detection limits of icp ms were 0 12 μg l 1 and 0 08 μg l 1 respectively the average recovery of

et al 2016 a is the effective area of the gel strip 0 5 1 8 cm2 for the zro chelex dgt and t is the dgt deployment time for as and cd the adsorption desorption kinetics between sediment and porewater as well as the release resupply kinetics from sediment to porewater were simulated and evaluated by employing the dgt induced fluxes in sediments difs model the model is rooted in a pair of interlinked parabolic partial differential equations that describe the dissolved and adsorbed solid metal concentrations in the sediment and dgt system harper et al 2000 the input parameters were calculated by as and cd concentrations of dissolved c d detected by peeper dgt labile concentration c dgt and solid labile concentration c s i e the sum of fractions f1 f2 and f3 as well as the other sediment parameters harper et al 1998 the resupply coefficient r was defined as the ratio of dgt labile to dissolved concentration equation 4 where a higher value implies a stronger resupply capacity the distribution coefficient k d was computed as the ratio of solid labile concentration to dissolved concentration equation 5 with a higher value indicating an elevated labile metal content of potential resupply the particle concentration p c on the other hand was defined as the ratio of the weight of sediment solid phase to the volume of porewater using these input parameters the difs model can simulate the curves of r values with deployment time and the output parameter t c which is defined as the required time until the perturbed system reaches 63 of the equilibrium state both the adsorption and desorption rate constants i e k 1 and k 1 were calculated by following equations 6 and 7 with a larger value denoting that less time is required for the sediment to desorb adsorb to

estuary 0 43 23 6 psu to coast 29 2 33 9 psu table 1 and fig 1 due to the decrease in rainfall and runoff in winter the salinity at estuarine sites is elevated compared that in summer the ph showed alkalescence ranging from 7 88 to 9 32 which basically decreased from xr 1 to xr 6 and was higher in winter than in summer the do concentration ranged from 2 20 to 6 16 mg l 1 with the highest value at xr 3 and the lowest at xr 6 both in summer the dissolved as concentration ranged from 1 72 to 5 40 μg l 1 without showing any apparent trend from river to coast while the dissolved cd concentration ranged from 3 53 to 6 71 μg l 1 with all relatively high values appearing at estuarine sites according to the grain size measurements the silt particles 4 64 μm were the major sediment components the tc and toc contents ranging from 0 52 to 2 10 were higher at river and estuarine sites xr 1 to xr 4 during both summer and winter and distinctly declined at coastal sites xr 5 and xr 6 indicating the terrigenous carbon transportation from river to coast similarly the c n ranged from 8 34 to 13 3 with a declining trend from river to coast during summer to winter season at coastal sites revealing mixed origin of the organics and receded terrigenous input in winter the highest ts content was found at xr 4 compared with lowest at xr 1 with values ranging from 1 10 to 6 90 g kg 1 respectively and the contents of metal loid fractions are presented in fig 2 except for an extremely higher f1 concentration at xr 5 in winter mn fractions roughly showed coherent tendencies with lowest at xr 4 and increasing to river and coast in both seasons specifically the f4 was the chief fraction followed by f1 and f2 with a negligible f3 portion it should be noted that the fe t content did not exhibit obvious variations between different sites however the fe ox content was highest at xr 3 and decreased from river to coast besides the f4 was the dominant fraction for as accounting for 78 96 of as t the distribution of as t content behavior as well as as f2 and fe ox resembles with fe t indicating a close linking relationship between fe and as the distribution and relative contents of cd fractions were considerably different from other metal loid s among them f1 was the dominant fraction for cd accounting for 53 79 of cd t except for the negligible f3 the distribution of other fractions and cd t was largely consistent with that of toc characterized by a marked decline at coastal sites 3 2 spatiotemporal distributions of dgt labile chemicals the depth profiles for concentrations of dgt labile chemical as cd fe mn and s in june and december are presented in figs 3 and 4 in the vertical distributions fe and mn showed agreement characterized by both minimal values in surface layers and apparent elevation at a certain depth followed by a continuous increase with occasional fall until the bottom more specifically the depth at which fe began to increase was deeper than that for mn with various levels in each profile alternatively s showed evident fluctuation especially in a high value area indicating an irregular pattern for individual profiles in this study as was found fairly similar to fe and mn with synchronous change and obvious vertical heterogeneity as such cd fractions were stable across the profiles with minor variability and a downward scheme along with the depths except for cd the vertical distribution of these dgt labile chemicals was different between summer and winter at most sites fig 5 shows the distributions of average values for dgt labile chemical concentrations in each profile in june the mn value was highest 0 85 mg l 1 at the coast lowest 0 07 mg l 1 in the river and moderate but variable in estuaries with radically inverse cd distribution ranging from 1 03 to 2 52 μg l 1 importantly the as distribution resembled that of fe with a maximum in estuaries xr 2 1 21 μg l 1 a moderate value 0 87 μg l 1 at the coast and a the lowest 0 46 μg l 1 in the river meanwhile the p distribution resemble with fe and as except for site xr 4 with comparatively higher concentrations moreover highest s value 0 52 mg l 1 was surprisingly observed at xr 4 moderate 0 2 mg l 1 at the coast and lowest 0 08 mg l 1 in the river in december a marked feature is that mn fe p and as appeared to show a significant increase in the river and a decrease at the coast whilst cd behaved in the opposite way as a result the difference between the six sites was tiny for cd values 1 82 2 02 μg l 1 in december the as distribution still resembled that of fe and p with an elevated value 0 80 μg l 1 in the river and a declining value 0 60 μg l 1 at the coast the s values at most of the sites was similar at both seasons 3 3 changes in dgt labile as cd fe and mn during indoor experiments the indoor experimental results unveiled that under varying salinity the vertical distributions for as cd fe and mn endured slight alterations between different profiles fig 6 the as values were in agreement with fe and particularly with mn in most profiles as featured by minimal values in the surface layers subsequently rising until the bottom or fluctuation with different degrees in contrary maximal cd values were recorded in the surface layers and a slight decline with depths in general all their vertical distributions resemble those of the field study yet there were noticeable changes in their profile averaged values among different salinities as shown in fig s1 with increasing salinity mn and fe concentrations generally increased with slight fluctuations as concentrations presented rule less but totally changes cd concentrations increased steady from s 0 to s 35 it was also verified by correlation analyses with significant positive linear correlation between cd mn and fe with salinity but nonsignificant correlation between as and salinity fig s2 3 4 resupply kinetics of as and cd evaluated by the difs model the input and output parameters of as and cd for the difs model are shown in table 2 for as the porewater concentrations c d ranged from 0 92 to 14 0 μg l 1 with a minimum at xr 1 in june which had the highest resupply coefficient r 0 31 and distribution coefficient k d 338 cm3 g 1 in contrast other r values were 0 15 and the k d values ranged from 39 to 322 cm3 g 1 in addition xr 1 in june also had the lowest t c value and the highest desorption rate constant k 1 and adsorption rate constant k 1 among all the sites for cd the porewater concentrations ranged from 2 3 to 7 0 μg l 1 with relatively high values appearing in the estuary r values were significantly higher than that of as ranging from 0 25 to 1 07 with the maximum appearing in the river and irregular changes in the estuary and at the coast the change in the k d value was generally in line with that of the r value in june while it showed a declining trend from river to coast in december two river sites held the noteworthy lowest t c value and highest k 1 and k 1 among all the sites 4 discussion 4 1 geo accumulation index igeo and pollution evaluation of as and cd as a single factor contaminant index i e the geo accumulation index i geo was applied to assess the pollution evaluation of sediment as and cd according to the following equation 8 müller 1969 8 i geo l o g 2 c i 1 5 b i where ci is the total content sum of f1 f2 f3 and f4 of sediment as and cd 1 5 is the background matrix correction factor and bi is the background value the regional geochemical baseline rgb and regional sediment background rsb cited from yan and zhao 1994 of as and cd are selected as background values respectively the calculation of rgb required a normalization method obtained from a correlation of contents between a conservative reference element e g fe lin et al 2012 and the element as and cd in the equation ramos miras et al 2011 as shown in table s2 i geo values 0 0 1 1 2 and 2 3 were classified as 0 1 2 and 3 grades corresponding to pollution classes of uncontaminated uncontaminated to moderately contaminated moderately contaminated and moderately contaminated to strongly contaminated respectively it is apparent that compared with non contaminated as cd exhibited sediment pollution to some extent especially when assessed according to rsb in addition the overlying water cd concentrations table 1 were close to or exceeded the different national and international guidelines e g epa cmc 2 μg l 1 set by the environmental protection agency 2006 who 3 μg l 1 set by the world health organization 2006 and the sea water quality standard grade ii 5 μg l 1 in china gb 3097 1997 in this study the cd pollution at estuarine sites was more serious in both sediments table s2 and fig 2 and overlying water table 1 the adjacent industrial park e g electroplate factories seems to be responsible for severe cd pollution although government supervision has been strengthened in recent years 4 2 geochemistry of mn fe and s the vertical distributions of dgt labile mn fe and s closely reflect the distribution patterns of mn2 fe2 and aqueous sulfide derived from both mn iii iv oxide reduction fe iii oxide reduction and sulfate reduction respectively lovley and phillips 1988 pan et al 2021 following the aerobic respiration and denitrification mn fe reduction and the production of dgt labile mn fe serve as intermediaries linking aerobic and anaerobic sulfidic conditions overall xr 4 was merely the exceptional site where both dgt labile mn and fe concentrations were negligible throughout nearly all the profiles accompanied by enriched dgt labile s figs 3 and 4 moreover xr 4 was the only sampling site with malodorous black sediment in the field featuring high toc and ts and low solid mn and fe contents table 1 and fig 2 which may be connected to anthropogenic pollution this indicates that intense sulfate reduction dominates om mineralization under the thoroughly anoxic conditions therefore intense sulfate reduction may occur in subsurface layers on top of the mn fe reduction layers particularly for xr 2 and xr 3 in fig 4 which is generally attributed to locally reactive om contents muyzer and stams 2008 in both summer and winter seasons the variation in the pattern of dgt labile mn fe and s from river to estuary to coast is irregular which should be related to different and complex depositional environments and associated with changing redox conditions organic matter and mn fe oxide availability burton et al 2006 nevertheless in some cases regular seasonal variations in the vertical profiles of mn fe and s are evident apparently corresponding to non steady state pattern in diagenetic profiles e g the subsurface enrichment of dgt labile s at xr 2 and xr 3 in december following extensive sediment reworking during changing river flow and tides sullivan and aller 1996 alterations in om were largely proved as the crucial factor controlling seasonal changes in redox conditions as well as the mn fe and s cycling this was in turn allied with increased toc contents that was resulted decreased aerobic depth and locally increased dgt labile mn fe and s concentrations in river sites xr 1 xr 2 and xr 3 nevertheless the toc contents were decreased in accordance with apparently increased aerobic depth and decreased dgt labile mn fe and s concentrations in coastal sites xr 4 xr 5 and xr 6 fig 5 the change in toc contents may be attributed to changes in rainfall and runoff induced terrigenous input during a droughty winter the hypoactive runoff has a limited capacity to transport materials to the ocean leading to accumulation of major chemicals e g c and fe in river sites and lower supply at coastal sites evidenced by decreased c n with receded terrigenous organics input in winter 4 3 mobility of as and the underlying factors in sediment and porewater coupled reductive dissolution of fe iii hydr oxides and mobilization of as has been observed in many studies bennett et al 2012 chakraborty et al 2012 sun et al 2016 although their decoupling has also been reported pan et al 2019b in the current study the linear correlations and cluster analyses fig 7 revealed a profound positive correlation and a close relationship between sediment fe and as e g fe t and as t fe ox and as f2 proving that as and fe have similar origins and that the reducible as is principally bound to fe oxides overall the dgt labile as and fe presented consistent distributions and significant positive correlations in nearly all vertical profiles table s3 variations in profile averaged fe and as values from river to estuaries to coast in both summer and winter were also quite in agreement with each other fig 5 and fig s3 these profiles illustrated a robust redox coupling of as with fe whereby as was primarily associated with solid fe hydr oxides in surface oxic sediments then they are synchronously reduced and released into the extensive anoxic porewater sullivan and aller 1996 and the relative abundances of remobilized as and fe are stable in different profiles upon spatiotemporal changes alternatively the distribution of p was also identical to fe and as denoting that p transport was also greatly influenced by the fe redox cycle in particular both p and as occupied similar adsorption sites on fe hydr oxides it is vital to assess that exceeding p concentrations 0 2 mg l 1 may perceptibly compete with as for the surface sites resulting in enhanced as release sun et al 2017 therefore this work uncovered covaried distributions of the dissolved p and as was found in this work except for highly sulfurized xr 4 which endorses p mobility with concomitant as scavenging although the vertical distributions of dgt labile as and mn were also mainly consistent table s3 their changes in average values and related solid contents in sediments were discrepant hence compared with fe the mn geochemistry was not the leading operative for modulating the as mobility consistently the non negative correlation between dgt labile as and s indicated that the presence of aqueous sulfide could not appreciably immobilize as table s3 another prevalent scenario was the xr 4 site with highly sulfidic conditions where dgt labile as concentrations were not exclusively negligible as labile fe particularly in december fig 4 it seems that the microbially mediated and sulfide induced as v reduction to as iii has not been adsorbed precipitated in sulfurized environments via multiple potential pathways involving organic complexation and generation of as s or as fe s precipitates rochette et al 2000 a recent study has confirmed that as mobilization was highly correlated with biogenic sulfide and that moderate thiolation of as can facilitate as release ye et al 2020 the pattern of dgt labile as variation from the river to estuary to coast was also irregular resembling fe as the complex depositional environment and redox associated availability of the sediment as pool whilst a change in toc content and c n controls the seasonal changes in dgt labile as by affecting fe redox cycling this demonstrates that although the mechanisms responsible for as mobility are multiple and changing in a complex river estuary coast environment terrigenous input organic matter and induced redox changes are crucial factors controlling the seasonal availability of as in surface sediments 4 4 mobility of cd and the underlying factors unlike as fe mn and s with apparent redox sensitive distributions dgt labile cd was rather stable throughout the profile with little fluctuation figs 3 and 4 as shown in table s3 and fig 5 the correlations of cd with fe mn and s are uncorrelated or negative in vertical profiles the results indicated that fe mn oxides were incompetent in exerting noteworthy implications on transporting consequently liberating cd in these sediments unexpectedly the sulfide had a non negligible effect on the solidification and immobilization of cd even at highly sulfidic conditions in xr 4 it is known that the incorporation of trace metal loid s into pyrite was recognized as the most intense for as but little to negligible for cd scholz and neumann 2007 although cd may form insoluble cadmium sulfide cds precipitates in the presence of aqueous sulfide its rate of enrichment was not necessarily controlled by the amount of sulfide availability sundby et al 2004 primarily in the presence of more thiophilic fe according to a previous study cd behavior was particularly associated with labile om and was largely unaffected by aqueous sulfide in porewater piper and perkins 2004 it is worth noting that dgt labile cd presented a slightly declining trend with depth confirming a of relative enrichment schemes in surface oxic layers and deficiency in deep anoxic layers a recent study described that cd contents in the estuarine and coastal sediments could be strongly regulated by the terrigenous inputs burgay et al 2020 also as the aerobic mineralization is widely accepted to be significantly faster than anaerobic mineralization irrespective of the degree of lability of the om dauwe et al 2001 de beer et al 2005 winkler et al 2019 thereby it was likely to comprehend that cd remobilization was largely bound with om decomposition in oxic sediments as shown in fig 7 a significant positive correlation and close relationship was observed between sediment cd cd f1 cd f2 and cd t and carbon tc and toc but not total inorganic carbon unravelling that cd was chiefly derived from om rather by authigenic carbonates this could be complimented owing to a similar ionic radius to a calcium ion cd can be taken up by several marine organisms through their ca ion pumps merian et al 2004 creating an enrichment of cd within the biogenic calcareous debris ciaralli et al 1998 ianni et al 2010 cd can also be fixed by phytoplankton and remobilized via aerobic degradation of the deposited om at the sediment surface gendron et al 1986 scholz and neumann 2007 another study also confirmed that cd is primarily released to sediment porewater by decomposition of om nameroff et al 2002 in addition cd is known to have a great affinity with carbonates carbon dioxide in the sediment is produced primarily by the aerobic breakdown of om or by anaerobic methanogenesis which can amplify the release of metal ions via decalcification du laing et al 2009 overall all these cases were associated with om decomposition and lead to a relatively higher cd availability in surface oxic sediments for spatiotemporal variation dgt labile cd presented different patterns in summer highest in xr 1 and lowest in xr 6 and winter little difference among all sites in fig 5 this variation can be ascribed by spatiotemporal differences in oxic depth as well as cd and toc availability in sediments in summer the oxic depth is consistent with dgt labile cd concentrations decreasing from river to estuary to coast further the xr 6 site held the lowest cd fractions and toc contents which is unfavorable for cd mobilization in winter the oxic depth got shallower in the river sites and deeper in the coastal sites owing to changed terrigenous material input as discussed above hence dgt labile cd concentrations decreased in the river sites and increased in the coastal sites in addition the sorbents were relatively ineffective at adsorbing cd due to close competition with mg and ca in particular under high salinity and non sulfidic conditions breckel et al 2005 which was beneficial for cd mobilization in the coastal site as discussed in section 4 5 against the low sediment cd background in contrast to the positive correlation between fe and as both mn and cd showed significant negative correlations particularly for their profile averaged values fig s3 actually the direct adverse contribution of mn geochemistry on cd mobility was not expected also the beginning of mn reduction functioned as a gateway betweenlinking aerobic and anaerobic sulfidic conditions this was further verified that a higher dgt labile mn concentration was generally connected with more anoxic conditions and a shallower oxic depth as also verified in this study ensuing limited cd mobility 4 5 salinity dependent mobilization of as and cd since the origin and treatment of the sediment cores was identical vertical distributions of dgt labile fe mn as and cd showed minimal deviations between different profiles fig 6 however the oxic depth reflected by the fe profile herein and mn fe reduction seems to become shallower and stronger with salinity gradient respectively fig s1 a previous study also found that iron reduction appeared to be enhanced during om oxidation after the salinity intrusion explained by the increasing ionic strength and decreasing ph in porewater which increase the available surface area of the fe iii oxide pool in these sediments weston et al 2006 nevertheless dgt labile as presented a subtle and irregular increase with salinity gradient though its vertical distributions were controlled by fe mn redox cycles table s4 thereupon the contribution of rising salinity on as mobility and bioavailability remains further debatable in contrast to oxoanions e g as the mechanism of cation e g cd mobility with increasing salinity is clear in this process cd can be transformed to soluble chloride complexes comans and vandijk 1988 preventing the bioavailability of free cd2 in porewater and increasing cd desorption from the sediment du laing et al 2009 in addition the increasing concentrations of major cations e g ca2 can compete with cd for the sorption sites inducing ion exchange and thus cd release breckel et al 2005 in the meantime the comparable results for dgt labile cd was also observed in the indoor experiments fig s1 featuring sustained elevation with salinity gradient however although the concentrations of hydro soluble cd are widely accepted to increase with salinity cd bioavailability or bioaccumulation have been reported to decrease pedro et al 2013 zhong et al 2020 partly due to the less bioavailable cd cl complexes compared to free cd2 du laing et al 2009 in the current study it was confirmed that the bioavailability and bioaccumulation of cd as evaluated by dgt clearly increase with salinity gradient which indicates that the newly formed cd cl complexes in porewater and labile particle cd in sediments tend to desorb and resupply the lost free cd2 captured by dgt in highly saline estuarine and coastal environments the results of salinity dependent experiment imply that the as and cd cycles in land ocean transition regions undergo various alterations to respond the rapid global change such as sea level rising induced saline intrusion 4 6 kinetic exchange of as and cd between sediments and porewater the difs model can simulate output parameters characterizing the adsorption desorption capacity of as and cd between sediment and porewater table 2 as well as can generate the r curves with deployment time fig 8 the initial rises in r curves are reflections of the establishment of a diffusive gradient at the very beginning concerned with the rates of diffusion in the sediment porewater ernstberger et al 2005 on the contrary the following declines were more dependent on the sediment labile pool with the remaining constant r curves pointing to the adequate supply of metals from the solid phase ernstberger et al 2005 for as in this study only xr 1 in june had a relatively high r value and an almost constant r curve with time after the establishment of the diffusive gradient in accordance with the highest k d k 1 k 1 and fastest t c this also proposed that the response time and time to reach equilibrium between adsorption and desorption processes for sediment and porewater were fastest together with the highest distribution coefficient i e resupply potential which was conducive for sustaining a sufficiently stable r value with time additionally all other sites showed either a weak resupply capacity low r or a weak resupply potential low k d in accordance with a slow adsorption and desorption response causing a continuous decrease in the r value without reaching equilibrium for xr 1 in december the subdued resupply capacity and potential of as should be associated with redox dependent as mobility moreover the enhanced fe reduction triggered further as mobilization and release to porewater in an anoxic environment therefore weakening r and k d obviously the kinetic exchange between sediment and porewater for cd was complicated and changeable as shown in table 2 the highest r and k d value due to the lowest cd concentrations also appear at xr 1 in both summer and winter accompanied by a noteworthy lowest t c value and highest k 1 and k 1 this suggests a significant rapid adsorption and desorption response which can continuously resupply cd with strong capacity r from sediment to porewater leading to consumption of the labile cd pool over time especially within a moderate solid cd background fig 2 this is why r values in the curve keep decreasing with time fig 8 in contrast xr 6 had the lowest r value in summer and lowest k d values in both summer and winter due to a relatively high c d concentration which represent a non steady state of weak and lackluster resupply featuring both low and decreasing r values with time apparently high salinity dependent cd mobilization at a coastal site is unfavorable for continuous resupply which leads to compromised resupply potential of the sediment particularly under exhausted labile cd pool fig 2 estuarine zones on the other hand falls between river and coastal sites featuring moderate r k d t c k 1 and k 1 values consequently r remained approximately constant after the establishment of a diffusive gradient indicating a steady state of stable resupply which is rigorously tied with an adequate labile cd pool fig 2 overall the difs model simulation indicates that a moderate resupply coefficient coupled with an adequate distribution coefficient and a labile pool are beneficial for sustaining a continuous and stable resupply of as and cd from surface sediments fluctuations in redox conditions and the associated as mobility is principally responsible for the seasonal change in as resupply capacity whereas the salinity dependent cd mobilization and the labile cd pool availability have greater responsibility for cd resupply capacity and potential 5 conclusions imaging the high resolution spatiotemporal distributions of dgt labile chemicals provided detailed insights into the vertical profile and seasonal as and cd mobility in dynamic sediments from the river to estuary to coast interface compared with non contaminating as cd exhibited sediment and overlying water pollution particularly at estuarine sites the pattern of variation in dgt labile mn fe and s from the river to estuary to coast was irregular due to complicated depositional environments while the shifts in om were emerged as the key factor controlling seasonal changes in redox conditions and thereby fostering mn fe and s cycling as and fe presented tight coupling for spatiotemporal distributions of both dgt species and solid phases reflecting a tight redox coupling of as with fe whereby as was primarily associated with solid fe hydr oxides in surface oxic sediments then synchronous reduction and release into the extensive anoxic porewater unlike other chemicals dgt labile cd showed a moderate decrease in the vertical profile and sediment cd fractions were closely connected with organic carbon indicating that cd remobilization was largely associated with aerobic decomposition of om besides its seasonal variation was attributed to spatiotemporal differences in oxic depth and cd and toc availability in sediments the results of the salinity related indoor experiments illustrated that the effect of rising salinity on as mobility and bioavailability was undefined which seemed not to be entirely associated with fe mn cycles whilst cd mobilization clearly increases with salinity gradient possibly due to increased desorption and resupply from cd complexes and sediment the difs model simulation indicates that the salinity dependent cd mobilization and labile cd pool availability are crucial for cd resupply capacity and potential it was worth noting that the redox condition and im mobilization kinetics responsible for as and cd mobility were completely opposite with oxic conditions favoring om decomposition and cd remobilization but as immobilization by sediment meanwhile the anoxic conditions promoted om and cd burial although as remobilization was associated with fe mn oxides reduction therefore as and cd redox geochemistry in the sediment water interface should attain more attention when subjected to spatially and temporally variable conditions in dynamic estuarine environments especially with reference to global change such as expanding global marine hypoxia and sea level rising declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

3242,large scale afforestation program has alleviated environmental problems to some extent in china however the response of hydrological processes to vegetation greening at different catchments remains unclear this study identified the impact of vegetation changes on runoff q evapotranspiration et and soil water storage sw as well as their relationships and sensitivities based on a coupled swat pml model for 23 catchments from 2000 to 2018 in the yellow river basin yrb results show that leaf area index lai was significantly p 0 05 increased in 72 2 of the yrb area vegetation greening decreased sw and q but increased et in all catchments the effects of vegetation greening on q and et were contrasting with axisymmetric fluctuation distribution the changes in sw et and q were strongly correlated with the changes in lai sensitivity of the changes in et and q to lai changes increased when the climate becomes drier our study suggests that the vegetation greening followed by the afforestation policy implementation has caused gradually increasing impacts on q and et however such effects are spatially heterogeneous due to different degrees of increase in lai and aridity conditions given the water crisis problem in the yrb afforestation activity should be taken into consideration of the increasing water demand and the negative effects of vegetation greening on water resources in the future keywords vegetation greening sensitivity analysis runoff evapotranspiration soil water storage yellow river basin 1 introduction vegetation is the basis for the survival of the

availability of water thereby affecting the vegetation growth in the global ecosystem heimann and reichstein 2008 seddon et al 2016 ma et al 2021 in contrast vegetation plays an important role in regulating hydrological processes at regional and global scales donohue et al 2007 vegetation change will affect the hydrological cycle by altering canopy transpiration rainfall interception and redistribution soil water infiltration and root water absorption as well as changing the energy distribution process li et al 2020a therefore vegetation is of vital importance in the hydrological cycle process energy exchange process and biogeochemical cycle process on the land surface many studies explored the impact of vegetation changes on runoff process however there are still some disagreements regarding the impact of vegetation changes on hydrology process in general runoff is reducing as the vegetation coverage increases zastrow 2019 bai et al 2020 li et al 2020a li et al 2020b but the phenomena of increasing runoff or unchanged runoff with increased vegetation coverage are also documented in some studies buttle and metcalfe 2000 ceballos barbancho et al 2008 zhou et al 2010 2015 wang et al 2011 andréassian 2004 these differences are caused by many factors such as the geographic location the nature of the underlying surface the type of vegetation and climatic conditions in the basins besides it is reported that the vegetation greening has no significant impact on water resources in humid areas but may significantly reduce water resources in arid and semi arid areas zhou et al 2010 2015 therefore it still requires comprehensive investigations on the impact of vegetation greening on hydrological processes in multiple basins covering various climate regimes a recent study found that china contributed 25 of the global net increase in green foliage from 2000 to 2017 chen et al 2019 especially the vegetation coverage of the yrb has been

main methods are used to investigate the impact of vegetation change on the hydrological process the paired catchment experiment s method bosch and hewlett 1982 brown et al 2005 the elastic coefficient method based on the budyko xu et al 2014 wu et al 2017 wang and hejazi 2011 patterson et al 2013 xin et al 2019 and the hydrological model simulation gerten et al 2004a gerten et al 2004b ivanov et al 2008 xi et al 2018 bai et al 2020 ma and szilagyi 2019 although the paired catchment experiment s method can more intuitively show the impact of vegetation changes on the hydrological process of a catchment it is limited by experimental conditions and scaling problems from small catchment experiments to large basins the elastic coefficient method based on budyko hypothesis is used to analyze the underlying surface parameters and the impact of vegetation changes on the hydrological process but the underlying surface parameters can be affected by the physical conditions of the underlying surface including terrain conditions and soil properties and other human activities singh basu nandita 2022 such as water conservancy project construction irrigation and mining to address the above limitations many land surface models e g the community land model clm oleson et al 2010 and hydrological models e g the soil water access tool model swat arnold and allen 1996 arnold et al 1998 2012 mosbahi and benabdallah 2019 were used to analyze the impact of vegetation changes on the hydrological process by setting up different simulation scenarios under fixed and changing vegetation conditions one of the great advantages of using above process based distributed eco hydrological models is that they can be applied to different temporal and spatial scales to better present a spatial heterogeneity of vegetation characteristics thus in order to quantitatively assess the impact of vegetation greening on hydrological variables and in view of the above three categories of methods this study used a distributed ecohydrological model to quantitatively investigate the impact of vegetation greening on hydrological processes this study coupled the soil and water assessment tool swat model with the penman monteith leuning pml model zhang et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the et module in the swat model was replaced by the corresponding et equation in the pml model and the simulation of the vegetation growth module in the swat model was replaced by the satellite observed leaf area index lai data which makes modelling of vegetation change impact on hydrological processes more reliable ma et al 2019 in this way the coupled model may simplify the calibration process and reduce the parameter uncertainty of the model but maintain the physical mechanism and the interactions between different water components of the hydrological process based on the improved distributed eco hydrological model swat pml this study uses 25 yrb catchments under different vegetation greening and climate conditions to achieve the following objectives 1 identifying the spatial differences of the vegetation growth conditions in different catchments in the yrb 2 quantifying the impact of vegetation changes on the hydrological processes et runoff and sw and 3 analyzing the sensitivity of et and runoff to

swat cup premium https www 2w2e com was used for parameter calibration and validation parameters calibrated in the swat pml model for all the catchments are shown in the supplementary material the monthly streamflow at 25 hydrological stations was used as the calibration 1981 1987 and validation 1988 1990 objectives to better calibrate the model parameters and reduce the model errors we used comprehensive objective function f which combined the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 bias and coefficient of determination r2 the objective function and the calculation of three evaluation indices are as follows f w3r2 w5nse w8bias 16 17 nse 1 i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 18 bias i 1 n q obs i i 1 n q sim i i 1 n q obs i 100 19 r 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs q sim i

number of months in the calibration period fig 2 summarizes the calibration and validation results of monthly streamflow for the swat pml models both nse and r2 values exceed 0 5 and the absolute value of bias is less than 20 in the calibration period in the validation period the nse and r2 values in 21 out of 25 catchments are more than 0 5 and the absolute values of bias in 23 out of 25 catchments are less than 25 this indicates that the calibrated swat pml model performed well in the hydrological process in most of the research catchments and can be applied to separate the impacts of vegetation greening on catchment streamflow among them there are two catchments id 5 hongliu river and id 6 maobulang with not satisfactory results and are removed from the subsequent analysis 2 3 6 partitioning of vegetable greening impact on hydrological processes apart from vegetation greening there are lots of other human activities such as silt dam construction reservoir construction coal mining urbanization and direct water extraction by humans that can potentially impact on hydrological processes their impacts are not included in our modelling since the key objective of this study is to isolate the vegetation greening impact on the hydrological processes as such two simulation scenarios were set to simulate the runoff process from 2000 to 2018 by using the well calibrated swat pml model fig 3 and table 2 both scenarios used the same meteorological forcing during 2000 2018 to eliminate the effects of climate the difference between the two scenarios were the input of lai dataset the first scenario s1 was driven by the daily average lai time series based on satellite observations during 1981 1990 i e lai for a particular day is the average of 10 lai values obtained from that day of 1981 1990 which represents the vegetation condition before vegetation greening the second scenario s2 was driven by the satellite observed daily lai for 2000 2018 to partition the vegetation greening impact on hydrological processes the impact of vegetation greening on q or et or sw was calculated as follows δw ws2 w s1 21 where δw is the impact of vegetation greening ws1 is the hydrological variable from 2000 to 2018 simulated by the swat pml model based on the daily average lai in 1981 1990 ws2 is the hydrological variable from 2000 to 2018 simulated by the swat pml model based on the satellite observed lai in 2000 2018 3 results 3 1 lai change from 1981 to 2018 in the yrb the annual lai trends by mann kendall mk method during 1981 2018 fig 4 a suggested that the area of increased annual lai accounted for 93 2 in the entire yrb of which 72 2 was statistically significant p 0 05 the area with decreased lai covered 6 8 of the whole yrb of which 1 5 of all yrb was statistically significant p 0 05 the annual lai trends during 2000 2018 were also analyzed fig 4 b it showed that the area of increased annual lai accounted for 80 6 in the entire yrb of which 56 8 was statistically significant p 0 05 the area with decreased lai covered 19 4 of the whole yrb of which 2 6 of all yrb was statistically significant apparently the vegetation restoration in the yrb was particularly strong for the studied period 3 2 impact of vegetation greening on different hydrological variables in all catchments as shown in fig 5 the vegetation greening reduced the soil water storage sw and runoff q but increased evapotranspiration et during 2000 to 2018 compared to that of the vegetation unchanged in all 23 studied catchments the total amount of the decrease in sw and q almost equaled the increase in et suggesting the perfert water balance however the impact of vegetation greening on the changes of the three hydrological variables varied greatly across different catchments the change in et caused by vegetation greening was the largest with the ranges of 0 65 mm yr 1 in kuye river catchment to 45 35 mm yr 1 in qiushui river catchment leading to an average value of 18 54 12 77 mm yr 1 the relative change in et was between 0 24 and 13 51 accordingly the change in q ranked second with the average value of 10 10 2 mm yr 1 where the smallest change was 0 28 mm yr 1 in the kuye river catchment and the largest change was 39 07 mm yr 1 in the quchan river catchment with the relative change of 0 32 26 51 sw showed the smallest change with an average value of 4 86 3 45 mm yr 1 the smallest decrease in sw was in the hei river catchment 0 17 mm yr 1 and the largest decrease was in the yiluo river catchment 14 77 mm yr 1 with the relative change of 0 29 6 76 in terms of spatial distribution the changes of the three hydrological variables in the middle and lower reaches of the yrb were much greater than those in the upper yrb the annual impacts of vegetation greening on et and q showed an axisymmetric distribution not only for the whole basin but also for each catchment fig 6 most of the catchment showed a decreasing fluctuation trend of δq compared to an increasing fluctuation trend of δet except for catchment 2 longwu river catchment and 21 feng river catchment with the gradual implementation of the policy of returning farmland to forests and the continuous improvement of vegetation coverage the impact of vegetation greening on the et and q processes was continuously expanded with an increasing fluctuation even though there were two catchments longwu river catchment id 2 and feng river catchment id 21 showed an increasing trend in δq and a decreasing trend in δet their average value of δq was 0 and the average value of δet was greater than 0 which was consistent with the negative and positive impacts of vegetation change to hydrological variables 3 3 relationship between the changes of three hydrological variables and vegetation fig 7 shows the relationship between the changes in the three hydrological variables and the changes in lai the difference of the averaged values between 2000 and 2018 and 1981 1990 it can be seen that the impacts on the three hydrological processes become stronger with the increase in vegetation change the δsw and δq exhibited a significant negative linear correlation p 0 05 with δlai while δet and δlai showed a significant positive linear correlation p 0 05 the slopes of the three relationships revealed that a unit increase in lai could cause a decrease in sw by approximately 45 6 mm an increase in et by 161 91 mm and a decrease in q by 124 95 mm obviously the greater the increase in lai the greater the decrease in sw and q and the greater the increase in et this change could be more meaningful when focused on a specific catchment where vegetation changed largely 3 4 sensitivity analysis of q and et to vegetation changes in all selected catchments the slope of the relationship between δq δet and δlai represented the sensitivity of the hydrological variables to changes in lai fig 8 and fig 9 show the δq and δet sensitivities to δlai in the 23 selected catchments there are 21 catchments showing significant linear relationships between δq and δlai while only two catchments longwu river and qin river failed the p 0 05 test fig 8 the sensitivity of each catchment varied greatly for example in the jing river catchment id 18 a unit increase in lai would cause a decrease in q by approximately 141 3 mm whereas in the sanchuanhe catchment id 13 a unit increase in lai would decrease q by approximately 31 mm the most sensitive catchment was the xiliugou id 7 with a slope of 245 2 mm and the least sensitive catchment was the kuye river id 11 which was only 2 48 mm decrease in q with one unit increase in lai likewise δet and δlai showed significant linear relationships in 21 catchments and only two catchments longwu river and daheiriver failed the p 0 05 test fig 9 among them the closest relationship between δet and δlai was found in the jing river catchment id 18 with the r2 value of 0 94 the sensitivity of δet to δlai in each catchment differed a lot for example in the jing river catchment id 18 a unit increase in lai could cause an increase in et by approximately 232 6 mm while in the sanchuan river catchment id 13 a unit increase in lai could increase et by approximately 80 4 mm the most sensitive catchment for δet and δlai was also the xiuliugou as it was for δq and δlai which would have an increase of et by 283 7 mm while the least sensitive catchment was also the kuye river in which the increase of et could only be 5 1 mm with a unit increase in lai 4 discussion 4 1 the impact of vegetation changes on hydrological processes the model simulations in this study were carried out by the coupled swat pml model which was an improved distributed eco hydrological model after well calibrated and validated two simulation scenarios were set by using the daily averaged lai in 1980 1990 and satellite observed lai in 2000 2018 respectively under the same meteorological driving conditions in the period of 2000 to 2018 the variable differences between the two simulation scenarios were regarded as the impact of vegetation changes on the hydrological process this study found that the changes in sw et and q had a strong correlation with vegetation greening for the whole yrb and each studied catchment respectively as the vegetation greeness increased sw and q showed significant decrease trends whereas et showed a significant increasing trend furthermore the relationships varied over the 23 catchments this was because sw and et affected vegetation in turn as plant growth was supported by water absorbed from root zone and transpiration therefore vegetation and water interact with each other as land use change and climate change which were the driving forces for the interactions of climate water and vegetation varied at each catchment the relationships exhibited the diverse magnitude vegetation has the function of conserving water sources and as the vegetation greening the runoff decreases continuously due to the differences in the characteristics of the underlying surface in different catchments the degree of runoff reduction by vegetation greening varies greatly overall our results are consistent with the previous findings li et al 2016a li et al 2016b shao et al 2019 li et al 2020a 2020b bai et al 2020 liu et al 2016 which showed that the increase in vegetation had a certain degree of weakening effect on q and sw but a certain positive correlation with et in the yrb especially in the loess plateau compared to the previous studies this study shows the following novel results 1 a unit increase in lai causing a decrease in sw by approximately 45 6 mm an increase in et by approximately 161 91 mm and a decrease in q by approximately 124 95 mm and 2 the sensitity of q and et to lai varying from catchment to catchment see section 3 4 but highly related to climate regime see section 4 2 4 2 sensitivity of the changes in et and q to changes in vegetation the sensitivity analysis can quantitatively reveal the impact of vegetation changes on q and et for each catchment and has a theoretical basis and guiding significance for afforestation ecological governance and protection and water resource management for the basin in the future comparing the sensitivity of q to lai fig 8 and et to lai fig 9 that significance test it is found that the sensitivity of et to lai in most catchments is greater than the sensitivity of q to lai fig 10 this finding is corroborated by the grace satellite that observed a downward trend of the sw in the yrb li et al 2020b wang et al 2018 since the increase in lai results in water lost to the atmosphere through et and reduces the q and sw the water scarcity of the basin will continue to increase if lai continues to increase in the future zhang et al 2018 also pointed out that in some areas of the yrb the high water consuming vegetation was introduced without planning resulting in excessive consumption of soil water resources and the formation of dry soil layers therefore after more than 10 years of the implementation of vegetation recovery it is time to pay more attention to the water shortage and management issues of the basin furthermore we analyzed the changes of the three evapotranspiration components canopy interception ei soil evaporation es and transpiration et to the change in lai fig 11 it showed that ei and et increased while es decreased after vegetation greening this was in line with the findings from zhang et al 2017 2019 who tried to explain the reasons for the increasing trend of et under vegetation greening on a global scale they found that as the shade of the soil surface increased the vegetation greening increased et but decreased es and the overall increase in et was about twice the decrease in es in addition li et al 2016a li et al 2016b also found that large scale vegetation restoration on the loess plateau led to an increasing in et resulting in the decrease in surface temperature and q in that area therefore the significant increase in et was one of the reasons that caused the sharp decrease in q 4 3 possible reasons for differences in sensitivity and future directions the sensitivity of et and q to the changes in lai were different at different catchment which related to the change mangnitute of lai another possible reason for this distinction could be the climatic conditions at each catchment to figure out possible reasons for this difference we investigate the relationships between the sensitivity of et and q to lai and the potential evapotranspiration precipitation pet p which represented the aridity degree of the catchment fig 12 the higher the pet p the drier the catchment is novick et al 2016 as shown in fig 12 there was a significant p 0 05 linear correlation between the sensitivity of et and q to changes in lai and the pet p the absolute sensitivity of et and q to lai changes increased as the pet p increased that is the drier the catchment the more sensitive et and q were to lai changes and vice versa that highlighted the importance to consider the water resource and climatic conditions when making afforestation policy to avoid additional water loss for the already dried catchment vegetation greening is a combination of a warming climate and human activities in this study we did not separate the individual influence of climate and human activities on vegetation greening due to its decoupling difficulties therefore the contributions of vegetation greening impact on hydrological processes that from climate and human activity need more research in the future 5 conclusions this study established an improved distributed swat pml eco hydrological model by coupling the pml and swat models twenty three catchments in the yrb were selected to explore the impact of vegetation greening on the hydrological variables i e soil water storage sw et and runoff q based on the swat pml model results show that lai increased significantly in 72 2 areas of the yrb from 1981 to 2018 the vegetation greening had an increasing impact on et and q in each catchment over time changes in sw et and q were significantly related to changes in lai for the entire basin and each catchment within the yrb the greater increase in lai the larger decrease in sw and q and the greater increase in et the sensitivities of changes in et and q to changes in lai were different across the selected catchments which highly correlated to the change manginitude of lai and pet p of each catchment the drier catchment was more sensitive to vegetation greening while the wetter catchment does the opposite this study provides insights on median to long term vegetation change impacts on water availability at catchment to regional scales

3242,large scale afforestation program has alleviated environmental problems to some extent in china however the response of hydrological processes to vegetation greening at different catchments remains unclear this study identified the impact of vegetation changes on runoff q evapotranspiration et and soil water storage sw as well as their relationships and sensitivities based on a coupled swat pml model for 23 catchments from 2000 to 2018 in the yellow river basin yrb results show that leaf area index lai was significantly p 0 05 increased in 72 2 of the yrb area vegetation greening decreased sw and q but increased et in all catchments the effects of vegetation greening on q and et were contrasting with axisymmetric fluctuation distribution the changes in sw et and q were strongly correlated with the changes in lai sensitivity of the changes in et and q to lai changes increased when the climate becomes drier our study suggests that the vegetation greening followed by the afforestation policy implementation has caused gradually increasing impacts on q and et however such effects are spatially heterogeneous due to different degrees of increase in lai and aridity conditions given the water crisis problem in the yrb afforestation activity should be taken into consideration of the increasing water demand and the negative effects of vegetation greening on water resources in the future keywords vegetation greening sensitivity analysis runoff evapotranspiration soil water storage yellow river basin 1 introduction vegetation is the basis for the survival of the

disagreements regarding the impact of vegetation changes on hydrology process in general runoff is reducing as the vegetation coverage increases zastrow 2019 bai et al 2020 li et al 2020a li et al 2020b but the phenomena of increasing runoff or unchanged runoff with increased vegetation coverage are also documented in some studies buttle and metcalfe 2000 ceballos barbancho et al 2008 zhou et al 2010 2015 wang et al 2011 andréassian 2004 these differences are caused by many factors such as the geographic location the nature of the underlying surface the type of vegetation and climatic conditions in the basins besides it is reported that the vegetation greening has no significant impact on water resources in humid areas but may significantly reduce water resources in arid and semi arid areas zhou et al 2010 2015 therefore it still requires comprehensive investigations on the impact of vegetation greening on hydrological processes in multiple basins covering various climate regimes a recent study found that china contributed 25 of the global net increase in green foliage from 2000 to 2017 chen et al 2019 especially the vegetation coverage of the yrb has been significantly improved and getting more attention after decades of implementation of the ecological restoration projects feng et al 2016 mao et al 2013 piao et al 2015 wang et al 2015 including the three north forest shelterbelt program since 1979 the natural forest conservation program since 1999 and the grain for green program since 1999 cao et al 2011 wei et al 2008 li et al 2020a the initial objective of those programs was to cope with soil erosion and reduce sediment content which has achieved a remarkable result feng et al 2016 wei et al 2008 the effects of the vegetation recovery on the water cycle in the yrb are however controversial and raise lots of debates zheng et al 2009 liu et al 2016 wang et al 2019 xie et al 2015 jia et al 2015 liu and shao 2014 ji and duan 2019 three main methods are used to investigate the impact of vegetation change on the hydrological process the paired catchment experiment s method bosch and hewlett 1982 brown et al 2005 the elastic coefficient method based on the budyko xu et al 2014 wu et al 2017 wang and hejazi 2011 patterson et al 2013 xin et al 2019 and the hydrological model simulation gerten et al 2004a gerten et al 2004b ivanov et al 2008 xi et al 2018 bai et al 2020 ma and szilagyi 2019 although the paired catchment experiment s method can more intuitively show the impact of vegetation changes on the hydrological process of a catchment it is limited by experimental conditions and scaling problems from small catchment experiments to large basins the elastic coefficient method based on budyko hypothesis is used to analyze the underlying surface parameters and the impact of vegetation changes on the hydrological process but the underlying surface parameters can be affected by the physical conditions of the underlying surface including terrain conditions and soil properties and other human activities singh basu nandita 2022 such as water conservancy project construction irrigation and mining to address the above limitations many land surface models e g the community land model clm oleson et al 2010 and hydrological models e g the soil water access tool model swat arnold and allen 1996 arnold et al 1998 2012 mosbahi and benabdallah 2019 were used to analyze the impact of vegetation changes on the hydrological process by setting up different simulation scenarios under fixed and changing vegetation conditions one of the great advantages of using above process based distributed eco hydrological models is that they can be applied to different temporal and spatial scales to better present a spatial heterogeneity of vegetation characteristics thus in order to quantitatively assess the impact of vegetation greening on hydrological variables and in view of the above three categories of methods this study used a distributed ecohydrological model to quantitatively investigate the impact of vegetation greening on hydrological processes this study coupled the soil and water assessment tool swat model with the penman monteith leuning pml model zhang et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the et module in the swat model was replaced by the corresponding et equation in the pml model and the simulation of the vegetation growth module in the swat model was replaced by the satellite observed leaf area index lai data which makes modelling of vegetation change impact on hydrological processes more reliable ma et al 2019 in this way the coupled model may simplify the calibration process and reduce the parameter uncertainty of the model but maintain the physical mechanism and the interactions between different water components of the hydrological process based on the improved distributed eco hydrological model swat pml this study uses 25 yrb catchments under different vegetation greening and climate conditions to achieve the following objectives 1 identifying the spatial differences of the vegetation growth conditions in different catchments in the yrb 2 quantifying the impact of vegetation changes on the hydrological processes et runoff and sw and 3 analyzing the sensitivity of et and runoff to

by remote sensing and geographic information mosbahi and benabdallah 2019 li et al 2021 gan et al 2021 the swat model mainly includes four major sub modules namely the hydrology module the soil

free parameters in the pml v2 model that maintain the physiological significances of the photosynthetic responses for the specific calculation process and parameter information please refer to zhang

swat cup premium https www 2w2e com was used for parameter calibration and validation parameters calibrated in the swat pml model for all the catchments are shown in the supplementary material the monthly streamflow at 25 hydrological stations was used as the calibration 1981 1987 and validation 1988 1990 objectives to better calibrate the model parameters and reduce the model errors we used comprehensive objective function f which combined the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 bias and coefficient of determination r2 the objective function and the calculation of three evaluation indices are as follows f w3r2 w5nse w8bias 16 17 nse 1 i 1 n q obs i q sim i 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs 2 18 bias i 1 n q obs i i 1 n q sim i i 1 n q obs i 100 19 r 2 i 1 n q obs i q obs q sim i

number of months in the calibration period fig 2 summarizes the calibration and validation results of monthly streamflow for the swat pml models both nse and r2 values exceed 0 5 and the absolute value of bias is less than 20 in the calibration period in the validation period the nse and r2 values in 21 out of 25 catchments are more than 0 5 and the absolute values of bias in 23 out of 25 catchments are less than 25 this indicates that the calibrated swat pml model performed well in the hydrological process in most of the research catchments and can be applied to separate the impacts of vegetation greening on catchment streamflow among them there are two catchments id 5 hongliu river and id 6 maobulang with not satisfactory results and are removed from the subsequent analysis 2 3 6 partitioning of vegetable greening impact on hydrological processes apart from vegetation greening there are lots of other human activities such as silt dam construction reservoir construction coal mining urbanization and direct water extraction by humans that can potentially impact on hydrological processes their impacts are not included in our modelling since the key objective of this study is to isolate the vegetation greening impact on the hydrological processes as such two simulation scenarios were set to simulate the runoff process from 2000 to 2018 by using the well calibrated swat pml model fig 3 and table 2 both scenarios used the same meteorological forcing during 2000 2018 to eliminate the effects of climate the difference between the two scenarios were the input of lai dataset the first scenario s1 was driven by the daily average lai time series based on satellite observations during 1981 1990 i e lai for a particular day is the average of 10 lai values obtained from that day of 1981 1990 which represents the vegetation condition before vegetation greening the second scenario s2 was driven by the satellite observed daily lai for 2000 2018 to partition the vegetation greening impact on hydrological processes the impact of vegetation greening on q or et or sw was calculated as follows δw ws2 w s1 21 where δw is the impact of vegetation greening ws1 is the hydrological variable from 2000 to 2018 simulated by the swat pml model based on the daily average lai in 1981 1990 ws2 is the hydrological variable from 2000 to 2018 simulated by the swat pml model based on the satellite observed lai in 2000 2018 3 results 3 1 lai change from 1981 to 2018 in the yrb the annual lai trends by mann kendall mk method during 1981 2018 fig 4 a suggested that the area of increased annual lai accounted for 93 2 in the entire yrb of which 72 2 was statistically significant p 0 05 the area with decreased lai covered 6 8 of the whole yrb of which 1 5 of all yrb was statistically significant p 0 05 the annual lai trends during 2000 2018 were also analyzed fig 4 b it showed that the area of increased annual lai accounted for 80 6 in the entire yrb of which 56 8 was statistically significant p 0 05 the area with decreased lai covered 19 4 of the whole yrb of which 2 6 of all yrb was statistically significant apparently the vegetation restoration in the yrb was particularly strong for the studied period 3 2 impact of vegetation greening on different hydrological variables in all catchments as shown in fig 5 the vegetation greening reduced the soil water storage sw and runoff q but increased evapotranspiration et during 2000 to 2018 compared to that of the vegetation unchanged in all 23 studied catchments the total amount of the decrease in sw and q almost equaled the increase in et suggesting the perfert water balance however the impact of vegetation greening on the changes of the three hydrological variables varied greatly across different catchments the change in et caused by vegetation greening was the largest with the ranges of 0 65 mm yr 1 in kuye river catchment to 45 35 mm yr 1 in qiushui river catchment leading to an average value of 18 54 12 77 mm yr 1 the relative change in et was between 0 24 and 13 51 accordingly the change in q ranked second with the average value of 10 10 2 mm yr 1 where the smallest change was 0 28 mm yr 1 in the kuye river catchment and the largest change was 39 07 mm yr 1 in the quchan river catchment with the relative change of 0 32 26 51 sw showed the smallest change with an average value of 4 86 3 45 mm yr 1 the smallest decrease in sw was in the hei river catchment 0 17 mm yr 1 and the largest decrease was in the yiluo river catchment 14 77 mm yr 1 with the relative change of 0 29 6 76 in terms of spatial distribution the changes of the three hydrological variables in the middle and lower reaches of the yrb were much greater than those in the upper yrb the annual impacts of vegetation greening on et and q showed an axisymmetric distribution not only for the whole basin but also for each catchment fig 6 most of the catchment showed a decreasing fluctuation trend of δq compared to an increasing fluctuation trend of δet except for catchment 2 longwu river catchment and 21 feng river catchment with the gradual implementation of the policy of returning farmland to forests and the continuous improvement of vegetation coverage the impact of vegetation greening on the et and q processes was continuously expanded with an increasing fluctuation even though there were two catchments longwu river catchment id 2 and feng river catchment id 21 showed an increasing trend in δq and a decreasing trend in δet their average value of δq was 0 and the average value of δet was greater than 0 which was consistent with the negative and positive impacts of vegetation change to hydrological variables 3 3 relationship between the changes of three hydrological variables and vegetation fig 7 shows the relationship between the changes in the three hydrological variables and the changes in lai the difference of the averaged values between 2000 and 2018 and 1981 1990 it can be seen that the impacts on the three hydrological processes become stronger with the increase in vegetation change the δsw and δq exhibited a significant negative linear correlation p 0 05 with δlai while δet and δlai showed a significant positive linear correlation p 0 05 the slopes of the three relationships revealed that a unit increase in lai could cause a decrease in sw by approximately 45 6 mm an increase in et by 161 91 mm and a decrease in q by 124 95 mm obviously the greater the increase in lai the greater the decrease in sw and q and the greater the increase in et this change could be more meaningful when focused on a specific catchment where vegetation changed largely 3 4 sensitivity analysis of q and et to vegetation changes in all selected catchments the slope of the relationship between δq δet and δlai represented the sensitivity of the hydrological variables to changes in lai fig 8 and fig 9 show the δq and δet sensitivities to δlai in the 23 selected catchments there are 21 catchments showing significant linear relationships between δq and δlai while only two catchments longwu river and qin river failed the p 0 05 test fig 8 the sensitivity of each catchment varied greatly for example in the jing river catchment id 18 a unit increase in lai would cause a decrease in q by approximately 141 3 mm whereas in the sanchuanhe catchment id 13 a unit increase in lai would decrease q by approximately 31 mm the most sensitive catchment was the xiliugou id 7 with a slope of 245 2 mm and the least sensitive catchment was the kuye river id 11 which was only 2 48 mm decrease in q with one unit increase in lai likewise δet and δlai showed significant linear relationships in 21 catchments and only two catchments longwu river and daheiriver failed the p 0 05 test fig 9 among them the closest relationship between δet and δlai was found in the jing river catchment id 18 with the r2 value of 0 94 the sensitivity of δet to δlai in each catchment differed a lot for example in the jing river catchment id 18 a unit increase in lai could cause an increase in et by approximately 232 6 mm while in the sanchuan river catchment id 13 a unit increase in lai could increase et by approximately 80 4 mm the most sensitive catchment for δet and δlai was also the xiuliugou as it was for δq and δlai which would have an increase of et by 283 7 mm while the least sensitive catchment was also the kuye river in which the increase of et could only be 5 1 mm with a unit increase in lai 4 discussion 4 1 the impact of vegetation changes on hydrological processes the model simulations in this study were carried out by the coupled swat pml model which was an improved distributed eco hydrological model after well calibrated and validated two simulation scenarios were set by using the daily averaged lai in 1980 1990 and satellite observed lai in 2000 2018 respectively under the same meteorological driving conditions in the period of 2000 to 2018 the variable differences between the two simulation scenarios were regarded as the impact of vegetation changes on the hydrological process this study found that the changes in sw et and q had a strong correlation with vegetation greening for the whole yrb and each studied catchment respectively as the vegetation greeness increased sw and q showed significant decrease trends whereas et showed a significant increasing trend furthermore the relationships varied over the 23 catchments this was because sw and et affected vegetation in turn as plant growth was supported by water absorbed from root zone and transpiration therefore vegetation and water interact with each other as land use change and climate change which were the driving forces for the interactions of climate water and vegetation varied at each catchment the relationships exhibited the diverse magnitude vegetation has the function of conserving water sources and as the vegetation greening the runoff decreases continuously due to the differences in the characteristics of the underlying surface in different catchments the degree of runoff reduction by vegetation greening varies greatly overall our results are consistent with the previous findings li et al 2016a li et al 2016b shao et al 2019 li et al 2020a 2020b bai et al 2020 liu et al 2016 which showed that the increase in vegetation had a certain degree of weakening effect on q and sw but a certain positive correlation with et in the yrb especially in the loess plateau compared to the previous studies this study shows the following novel results 1 a unit increase in lai causing a decrease in sw by approximately 45 6 mm an increase in et by approximately 161 91 mm and a decrease in q by approximately 124 95 mm and 2 the sensitity of q and et to lai varying from catchment to catchment see section 3 4 but highly related to climate regime see section 4 2 4 2 sensitivity of the changes in et and q to changes in vegetation the sensitivity analysis can quantitatively reveal the impact of vegetation changes on q and et for each catchment and has a theoretical basis and guiding significance for afforestation ecological governance and protection and water resource management for the basin in the future comparing the sensitivity of q to lai fig 8 and et to lai fig 9 that significance test it is found that the sensitivity of et to lai in most catchments is greater than the sensitivity of q to lai fig 10 this finding is corroborated by the grace satellite that observed a downward trend of the sw in the yrb li et al 2020b wang et al 2018 since the increase in lai results in water lost to the atmosphere through et and reduces the q and sw the water scarcity of the basin will continue to increase if lai continues to increase in the future zhang et al 2018 also pointed out that in some areas of the yrb the high water consuming vegetation was introduced without planning resulting in excessive consumption of soil water resources and the formation of dry soil layers therefore after more than 10 years of the implementation of vegetation recovery it is time to pay more attention to the water shortage and management issues of the basin furthermore we analyzed the changes of the three evapotranspiration components canopy interception ei soil evaporation es and transpiration et to the change in lai fig 11 it showed that ei and et increased while es decreased after vegetation greening this was in line with the findings from zhang et al 2017 2019 who tried to explain the reasons for the increasing trend of et under vegetation greening on a global scale they found that as the shade of the soil surface increased the vegetation greening increased et but decreased es and the overall increase in et was about twice the decrease in es in addition li et al 2016a li et al 2016b also found that large scale vegetation restoration on the loess plateau led to an increasing in et resulting in the decrease in surface temperature and q in that area therefore the significant increase in et was one of the reasons that caused the sharp decrease in q 4 3 possible reasons for differences in sensitivity and future directions the sensitivity of et and q to the changes in lai were different at different catchment which related to the change mangnitute of lai another possible reason for this distinction could be the climatic conditions at each catchment to figure out possible reasons for this difference we investigate the relationships between the sensitivity of et and q to lai and the potential evapotranspiration precipitation pet p which represented the aridity degree of the catchment fig 12 the higher the pet p the drier the catchment is novick et al 2016 as shown in fig 12 there was a significant p 0 05 linear correlation between the sensitivity of et and q to changes in lai and the pet p the absolute sensitivity of et and q to lai changes increased as the pet p increased that is the drier the catchment the more sensitive et and q were to lai changes and vice versa that highlighted the importance to consider the water resource and climatic conditions when making afforestation policy to avoid additional water loss for the already dried catchment vegetation greening is a combination of a warming climate and human activities in this study we did not separate the individual influence of climate and human activities on vegetation greening due to its decoupling difficulties therefore the contributions of vegetation greening impact on hydrological processes that from climate and human activity need more research in the future 5 conclusions this study established an improved distributed swat pml eco hydrological model by coupling the pml and swat models twenty three catchments in the yrb were selected to explore the impact of vegetation greening on the hydrological variables i e soil water storage sw et and runoff q based on the swat pml model results show that lai increased significantly in 72 2 areas of the yrb from 1981 to 2018 the vegetation greening had an increasing impact on et and q in each catchment over time changes in sw et and q were significantly related to changes in lai for the entire basin and each catchment within the yrb the greater increase in lai the larger decrease in sw and q and the greater increase in et the sensitivities of changes in et and q to changes in lai were different across the selected catchments which highly correlated to the change manginitude of lai and pet p of each catchment the drier catchment was more sensitive to vegetation greening while the wetter catchment does the opposite this study provides insights on median to long term vegetation change impacts on water availability at catchment to regional scales

3243,rivers losing flow into surrounding aquifers losing rivers are common under changing climates and groundwater overexploitation the riparian plant water relations under various water table dynamics along a losing river remain unclear in this study the water isotopes δ2h and δ18o leaf δ13c and mixsiar model were used combinedly for determining the root water uptake patterns and leaf water use efficiency wue of salix babylonica l at three sites a b and c with different water table depths wtds in the riparian zone of jian and chaobai river in beijing china the correlations of water source contributions with wtd and wue were quantified the riparian s babylonica primarily took up upper 0 80 cm soil water 71 5 with the lowest leaf δ13c 28 8 1 1 at site a under deep wtd 20 5 0 5 m in contrast deep water below 80 cm depth including groundwater contributed 55 1 to s babylonica at site b with fluctuated shallow wtd 1 9 0 4 m where leaf δ13c was highest 27 9 1 0 the s babylonica mainly used soil water in 30 170 cm layer 56 9 with mean leaf δ13c of 28 2 0 7 at site c with stable shallow wtd 1 5 0 1 m it was found that both the contributions of upper soil water in 0 80 cm and deep water below 80 cm had significantly quadratic correlations with wtd under shallow water table conditions p 0 05 leaf δ13c was negatively correlated with contributions of upper soil water above 80 cm depth but it was positively related to the contributions of deep water below 80 cm in linear functions p 0 001 the results indicated that 2 1 m was the optimum wtd for riparian trees because they maximized the use of deep water sources to get the highest wue this study provides insights into managing groundwater surface water resources and riparian afforestation in losing rivers keywords root water uptake pattern water use efficiency water table depth stable isotopes riparian s babylonica losing river 1 introduction many rivers are drying up under warming climates and groundwater overexploitation worldwide which causes serious decline of water table and degradation of riparian vegetation rood et al 2003 garcia et al 2017 ecological water e g excess surface flow or reclaimed water has been widely used to recharge dry rivers in recent years long et al 2020 he et al 2021 widespread loss of riverflow into underlying aquifers occurs where groundwater levels lie below nearby rivers losing rivers winter et al 1998 jasechko et al 2021 the recharge process increases the water availability for riparian vegetation and various species have been planted to restore the riparian ecosystem however increased plant transpiration was linked to reduced riverflow and groundwater level vanderklein et al 2014 missik et al 2019 mkunyana et al 2019 although some studies claimed that transpiration was not closely coupled to riverflow mcdonald et al 2015 therefore investigating the water use characteristics of riparian species is critical to recover the losing rivers especially in water scarce regions it will provide critical insights into managing groundwater and surface water resources as well as riparian afforestation under climate change the δ2h and δ18o have been widely applied to identify the root water uptake patterns of riparian plants dawson and ehleringer 1991 wang et al 2019a oerter and bowen 2019 flanagan et al 2019 dawson and ehleringer 1991 utilized deuterium tracer technique to identify that mature trees nearby a perennial stream rarely absorbed the stream water but used water from deeper strata in the wasatch mountains of semiarid western usa however oerter and bowen 2019 revisited the same experimental site in dawson and ehleringer 1991 and demonstrated that soil water was the primary source for these streamside trees via the in situ soil water vapor isotope measurements applying the stable isotope δ2h and δ18o tracer technique several studies concluded that the distances away from the riverbank as well as seasonal variations of climate could significantly affect water uptake patterns of riparian trees for example ripairan trees at distances 5 15 m from the riverbank substantially depended on soil water and groundwater for plant transpiration without water absorpton from the nearby river water throughout the growing season mensforth et al 1994 qian et al 2017 wang et al 2019a shallow soil water recharged by recent precipitation was generally used as the primary water source for riparian plants during wet season whereas deep soil water and groundwater were principal in dry season dawson and pate 1996 wang et al 2019a in particular groundwater is perceived as a reliable and continuous water source for deep rooted riparian trees indicated by consistent water isotopes of stems and groundwater barbeta and penuelas 2017 li et al 2019 the water table depth wtd has great effects on riparian plant water use nippert et al 2010 chen et al 2016 jasechko et al 2021 chen et al 2016 found that desert riparian species under the wtd of 1 8 m used a mixture of soil water below 75 cm depth groundwater and river water once the wtd increased to 3 8 m and 7 2 m species mainly relied on deeper soil water below 150 cm and even groundwater majority of studies indicated that the increasing wtd induced water uptake pattern adjustments towards deeper water sources barbeta et al 2015 chen et al 2016 li et al 2019 nevertheless some studies argued that riparian trees switched their water sources from groundwater to vadose zone soil water in response to the water table decline nippert et al 2010 busch et al 1992 riparian species might change root distributions and develop plastic water uptake patterns in order to acclimate to the variable wtds horton et al 2001 therefore it is necessary to investigate the water uptake patterns for riparian trees under various water table conditions furthermore little is known about the quantitative relationship between the wtd and root water uptake patterns of the riparian plants the shift of water sources for riparian plants is mainly driven by leaf transpiration leaf water use efficiency wue defining as the ratio of photosynthetic rate and transpiration rate is a crucial indicator to reflect plant water use characteristics farquhar et al 1989 wang et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 the plant leaf δ13c is positively correlated with intrinsic wue especially for c3 plants and it can be used as an indicator of wue wang et al 2019b a growing numbers of evidence showed that plants with higher dependence on deeper water sources were generally linked to higher wue and survive drought more successfully picon cochard et al 2001 liu et al 2017 ding et al 2020 the wue of arid and semi arid deep rooted plant species was observed to increase with deeper wtd si et al 2015 whereas antunes et al 2018 found that there was no response of wue to increasing wtd for the semi arid dimorphic rooted conifer trees it can be found that most of above studies are located in arid and semi arid areas it is still uncertain how wue of riparian plants coordinates with root water uptake patterns under different wtd conditions in losing rivers the aim of this study was to identify and understand water strategies of deep rooted riparian trees along gradients of wtd using stable isotopes δ2h δ18o and δ13c together with the mixsiar model focusing on rivers in beijing china the objectives of this study were 1 to quantify the seasonal water uptake patterns for riparian trees under different wtds and distances away from the riverbank 2 to compare the leaf wue of riparian trees under different wtds and distances away from the riverbank 3 to determine the quantitative relationships of water uptake patterns with wtd and leaf wue these results will provide insights on riparian ecosystem and water resources management of losing rivers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and field measurements the experiments of salix babylonica l were conducted from may to november in 2019 in the riverside of the jian and chaobai river beijing china 40 07 30 n 116 40 37 e fig 1 a sub humid monsoon climate with mean temperature of 11 5 c and mean relative humidity rhu of 60 is dominant in this study area the multi year 1961 2021 average precipitation is 532 mm with 84 5 of which occurring at the rainy season during june 15 and september 15 fig 2 in comparison the total precipitation in 2019 was 445 6 mm with 73 9 of which concentrated on the rainy season fig 2 thus 2019 was identified as a dry year based on the multi year 1961 2021 rainfall frequency curve the jian and chaobai river were dried up between 1999 and 2007 and have been recharged with ecological water since 2007 s babylonica with deep roots was one of the most widespread planted riparian species in the study area the maximum rooting depth of s babylonica can reach about 4 m and vary with different water tables ferro et al 2003 three representative sites a b and c with different wtds were selected along the jian and chaobai river fig 1 at each site four plots planted with s babylonica at distance of 5 m 10 m 20 m and 45 m away from the riverbank d05 d10 d20 and d45 respectively were constructed for field measurements and sample collections fig 1 a tilting rain gauge of 0 2 mm per tip sl3 1 shanghai meteorological instrument shanghai china was used to record daily precipitation in the meteorological observation station fig 1 the river water level nearby each site was monitored using a doppler open channel flowmeter hoh l 01 king water co ltd beijing china the groundwater level was measured once a month using a pressure type groundwater stage gauge hoh s y king water co ltd beijing china placed in the monitoring wells the river water level was observed to fluctuate at 28 4 29 4 27 9 28 9 and 26 5 27 3 m nearby the sites a b and c respectively fig 2a the wtd at site a 20 5 m 0 5 m was significantly p 0 01 deeper than the other two sites b 1 9 m 0 4 m and c 1 5 m 0 1 m the wtd fluctuation was more significant at site b compared with the stable wtd at site c fig 2b 2 2 sample collection six field campaigns were conducted to collect water samples of river groundwater precipitation soil and stem for δ2h and δ18o measurements as well as plant leaf samples for δ13c analysis on may 5 june 14 july 26 august 15 september 26 and november 5 river water nearby each site was sampled by means of a hydrophore while a sucking pump was used to collect groundwater in monitoring wells precipitation was sampled using a device consisted of a polyethylene bottle a funnel and plastic ball during the observation period sun et al 2019 one riparian s babylonica with diameter of 23 3 cm at breast height in each plot was selected to measure the water stable isotopes in stem and leaf δ13c fig 1 several suberized and mature stems were sampled from each s babylonica and removed the phloem and bark to prevent isotopic contamination stems were put into 12 ml glass vials and kept refrigerated before stem water extraction and isotope analysis mature foliage approximately 50 leaves from branches at similar heights 4 5 m of s babylonica tree was collected for plant leaf δ13c analysis the collected leaves were oven dried at 65 c for at least 64 h until they reached a constant mass on the day of sampling subsequently leaf samples were ground into fine powder and sieved using a 0 15 mm mesh screen soil cores within 1 m of each s babylonica tree in the four plots were obtained by a power auger chpd78 christie engineering company sydney australia the soil samples were collected at depths of 0 5 5 10 10 15 15 20 20 30 30 40 40 60 60 80 90 110 150 170 190 210 250 270 and 280 300 cm they were removed roots put into 12 ml glass vials and kept frozen in a refrigerator before soil water extraction and isotope analysis soil was also sampled to measure the gravimetric soil water content swc using the oven dry method at the same depths listed above 2 3 isotopic analyses water in stem and soil samples was extracted using the automatic cryogenic vacuum distillation system li 2100 lica beijing china the whole extraction progress lasted for 3 h and the extraction efficiency was all up to 99 to ensure no isotopic fractionation the isotopic ratio infrared spectroscopy iris system dlt 100 los gatos research mountain view usa was applied to measure the δ2h and δ18o in precipitation river water soil water and groundwater to avoid the organic contaminants during iris measurements the isotopic composition of stem water was analyzed using the isotope ratio mass spectrometry irms system mat253 thermo fisher scientific bremen germany the measuring precisions of both iris and irms system were 1 for δ2h and 0 1 for δ18o in different water samples respectively the measured δ2h and δ18o were then calibrated with the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow sun et al 2019 zhao and wang 2021 there was no significant difference in δ2h and δ18o measurements for soil water groundwater precipitation and river water analyzed by the irms and iris systems li et al 2021 the δ13c in plant leaf was measured using the irms system mat253 thermo fisher scientific bremen germany with a precision of 0 15 the measured δ13c in plant leaf was calibrated with the vienna pee dee belemnite v pdb 2 4 mixsiar model the mixsiar model v3 1 stock and semmens 2016 coupled with δ2h and δ18o isotopes was applied to identify the potential water source contributions to riparian s babylonica because the wtd was much deeper than the maximum rooting depth of s babylonica trees at site a groundwater could not be taken up by trees in light of the water isotopic composition and swc distributions in the profile soil water in the four layers of 0 30 30 80 80 170 and 170 300 cm were classified as the potential water sources of s babylonica trees at site a since water isotopic values of groundwater were similar to those of soil water in the 170 300 cm layer they had been merged into one potential water source soil water in 170 300 cm layer besides the soil water sources in the 0 30 cm 30 80 cm and 80 170 cm layers for s babylonica trees under shallow wtd sites b 1 9 m 0 4 m and c 1 5 m 0 1 m these isotopic compositions of potential water sources were referred as source data in the mixsiar model while the mixture data was set as the δ2h corrected by potential water source line pwl correction method li et al 2021 and raw δ18o in stem water more details about the mixsiar model parameter settings were given in li et al 2021 2 5 statistical analysis the seasonal differences in the isotopes of different water bodies swc proportional contributions of water sources and plant leaf δ13c values among the three sites as well as those among the four plots at different distances away from the riverbank were evaluated by the one way analysis of variance anova incorporating with post hoc tukey s kolmogorov smirnov and levene s tests p 0 05 sun et al 2018 regression analyses were performed to quantify the relationships of water source contributions with wtd and plant leaf δ13c values all statistical analyses were conducted with the spss 24 0 software spss inc usa 3 results 3 1 variations of soil water contents and isotopes in different waters the swc in different soil layers varied greatly with sampling campaigns and distances away from the riverbank among the sites a b and c fig 3 the swc values in upper 0 80 cm layer were significantly higher at site a than other two sites throughout the observation period p 0 001 however the swc in 170 300 cm layer at site a was much lower with significantly seasonal variations compared with other two sites p 0 001 a significant decrease of swc was observed from may 0 32 g g 1 to july 0 09 g g 1 in 170 300 cm layer at site a the swc in 80 170 cm layer was lower but changed greatly with seasons standard deviation of 0 8 g g 1 at site b than other two sites furthermore no significant difference in swc in 0 80 cm layer was found among four distances at site a p 0 05 but decreasing swc was found in 170 300 cm layer from d05 to d45 fig s1 the swc in 80 170 cm layer decreased from d05 to d45 at site b there was no significant difference in swc distributions among the four distances at site c p 0 98 fig s1 the isotopes in groundwater at site a mean of 71 1 for δ2h and 10 2 for δ18o were significantly more depleted than those of groundwater at sites b mean of 58 9 for δ2h and 7 6 for δ18o and c mean of 59 4 for δ2h and 7 7 for δ18o p 0 01 fig 4 and table s1 there was no significant difference in the isotopic compositions of river water among the three sites p 0 05 it was obvious that the δ2h and δ18o in river water were much more enriched than those in groundwater at all the three sites p 0 05 fig 4 and table s1 the isotopic compositions of soil water had no significant difference in the 0 80 cm layer among the three sites p 0 96 but they were more enriched below 80 cm at sites b and c compared with those at site a p 0 05 the slopes of soil water line swl at sites b and c were much lower than those at site a indicating stronger soil water evaporation at sites b and c no significant difference in isotopic values of soil water was observed among four plots d05 d10 d20 d45 at site a p 0 83 the δ2h and δ18o in soil water in the 80 170 cm layer were gradually depleted from d05 to d45 during june and august at site b while they increased from d05 to d20 but then decreased in plot d45 at site c fig 4 and table s1 the slope of swl gradually increased with the increase of distance away from the riverbank at the three sites suggesting a decrease of soil water evaporation from d05 to d45 the stem water isotopes at sites a and c were slightly depleted than those at site b fig 4 and table s1 δ2h and δ18o in stem water gradually enriched from d05 to d20 at sites a and c whereas they were depleted from d05 to d45 at site b 3 2 seasonal and spatial variations in root water uptake patterns the water uptake patterns of riparian s babylonica were strongly different among the three sites figs 5 and 6 s babylonica primarily took up upper soil water in 0 80 cm layer with mean contributions of 71 5 throughout the observation period at site a with deep wtd fig 5a and 6a the soil water below 80 cm depth primarily contributed to s babylonica with proportions 55 1 at site b with fluctuated shallow wtd fig 5b and 6b in comparison the main water source of s babylonica at site c under shallow wtd without significant fluctuation was soil water in 30 170 cm layer with mean contributions of 56 9 throughout the observation period fig 5c and 6c s babylonica at site a absorbed particularly more soil water in 0 30 cm layer 44 2 than sites b 20 7 and c 22 8 p 0 01 moreover the proportional contributions of soil water in 170 300 cm layer or groundwater to s babylonica were significantly different among sites a 13 6 b 28 3 and c 18 3 p 0 01 fig 6 the contributions of potential water sources to s babylonica exhibited significantly seasonal differences among the three sties p 0 05 a decrease of the soil water contribution below 80 cm depth associated with an increase in 0 80 cm layer was shown with the growth of s babylonica trees at site a fig 5a the soil water contribution in 80 170 cm layer to s babylonica decreased significantly 21 6 during june to august with a water table decline 0 8 m at site b fig 5b p 0 05 meanwhile s babylonica water uptake from surficial soil water in 0 30 cm layer increased by 20 0 during rainy season p 0 05 s babylonica trees at site c kept reducing the water uptake proportions in 30 80 cm layer from may 46 7 to november 17 7 while groundwater contributions increased by 10 7 fig 5c p 0 05 although significant seasonal differences in riparian tree water uptake depths were observed p 0 05 there was no general and significant correlation between environmental factors e g air temperature rhu and precipitation and upper soil water 0 80 cm contribution to riparian trees at the three sites p 0 05 fig s2 the water use characteristics of s babylonica varied distinctly along the distance away from the riverbank at the three sites the superficial 0 30 cm soil water contributions increased significantly by 23 0 from d05 to d20 p 0 05 whereas deep 170 300 cm soil water contributions to s babylonica reduced by 6 4 from d05 to d45 at site a fig 6a the s babylonica took up more groundwater but less soil water in 80 170 cm layer from d05 to d45 at site b fig 6b in particular the groundwater contribution to s babylonica at d20 and d45 significantly increased by an average of 14 4 when the water table declined from 1 7 m to 2 5 m at site b p 0 05 on the contrary s babylonica reduced water absorption 47 3 from deep water below 80 cm but accessed more upper soil water 28 6 significantly p 0 05 in response to the 0 8 m decline of wtd at d05 and d10 at site b p 0 05 at site c the contributions of deep water below 80 cm depth reduced remarkably 20 2 from d05 to d45 whereas the upper soil water increased the contributions 14 1 to s babylonica from d05 to d20 fig 6c p 0 05 3 3 changes in leaf δ13c of riparian trees the leaf δ13c values at the three sites varied differently with increasing distance from the riverbank during the observation period fig 7 riparian trees at site a had significantly lower leaf δ13c values mean of 28 8 than those at the other two sites b mean of 27 9 and c mean of 28 1 p 0 05 there was a significant decrease of leaf δ13c value 2 3 from d05 to d20 at site a p 0 05 however the δ13c values generally increased with increasing distance from the riverbank ranging from 28 8 at d05 to 27 0 at d45 at site b it was found that the leaves of s babylonica at d20 and d45 had significantly higher δ13c values mean of 27 1 than those at other two distances mean of 28 7 at site b p 0 05 the leaf δ13c of the s babylonica nearest the riverbank mean of 27 6 at d05 at site c was higher than that at other distances mean of 28 4 fig 7 significant seasonal differences in the leaf δ13c values were shown among the three sites p 0 05 table s2 the δ13c values in the tree leaves were the lowest in may mean of 28 7 and august mean of 28 7 the leaf δ13c in plot d05 at site c showed an increasing trend with the growth of s babylonica compared with that at sites a and b table s2 nevertheless no significant regression relationship between leaf δ13c value of s babylonica and environment factors e g air temperature rhu and precipitation was observed at the tree sites p 0 05 fig s3 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of water table depth on riparian tree water uptake pattern this study indicated that the depth and fluctuation of water table diversified the water uptake patterns of riparian trees near the losing river naumburg et al 2005 simunek and hopmans 2009 fan et al 2017 antunes et al 2018 it agreed well with previous studies that riparian trees primarily took up soil water in upper 0 80 cm layer under deep wtd with weaker hydraulic connections between the river and underlying groundwater system fig 5a and 6a wu et al 2021 an evident shift of the main water uptake depth of riparian trees from soil water in 30 80 cm layer towards deeper soil layers or groundwater was found when the wtd increased from 1 5 0 1 m to 1 9 0 4 m under shallow wtd condition with closer river water groundwater interactions in this study fig 5b 5c 6b and 6c it suggested that the deep root growth and their water uptake capabilities were limited under shallow wtd without significant fluctuations 1 5 0 1 m fig 5c and 6c or oxygen stress conditions naumburg et al 2005 fan et al 2017 nevertheless riparian trees could gradually acclimate to persistently shallow wtd environment with plant growth indicated by an increase of groundwater utilization 10 7 for riparian trees from may to november fig 5c and 6c naumburg et al 2005 in addition these riparian trees closer to the stream generally had better ability to adapt to oxygen stress which could be derived from the decreasing deep water contributions along the distance away from riverbank fig 6c fluctuated shallow wtd could motivate riparian trees to develop a dimorphic root system and switch their water main uptake depths between the shallow soil layers and deep layers fig 5b and 6b zencich et al 2002 but the responses to water table decline of riparian trees at different distances at fluctuated wtd area differed significantly with reducing water absorption from deep water below 80 cm at distance within 10 m and increasing groundwater utilization at distance of 20 m and 45 m away from the riverbank fig 5b and 6b the stimulation of deep roots helped riparian trees susceptible to drought stress at distance 20 m from the riverbank survive from the climate drought ehleringer and dawson 1992 antunes et al 2018 li et al 2019 or river water level lowering during rainy season as shown in this study fig 3c and 5b the quantitative relationship between the shallow wtd and contributions of different water sources to riparian trees was not discovered in previous studies in our study a significantly quadratic relationship was found between the wtd and proportional contributions of upper soil water in 0 80 cm layer r2 0 43 p 0 05 at shallow wtd areas sites b and c fig 8 a meanwhile the wtd had a significant quadratic correlation with deep water contributions below 80 cm depth r2 0 43 p 0 05 fig 8b particularly riparian s babylonica at constant shallow wtd sites wtd 1 7 m increased deep water absorption with increasing wtd whereas those under fluctuated shallow wtd 1 7 2 5 m showed an increase and then decrease of deep water contribution as water table declined fig 8b the upper soil water contribution was minimum at the wtd of 2 1 m when the deep water contribution reached a maximum value it could be explained that declining water tables wtd increased from 1 5 m to 2 1 m aerated deep soil layers benefited for new deep root exploitation and further stimulated riparian trees to utilize deep water when groundwater severely restricted the active root zone of riparian trees under oxygen stress naumburg et al 2005 however riparian trees can tolerate declining water table only up to a species specific threshold value beyond which drought stress occurred sperry et al 1998 in this study when the wtd exceeded 2 1 m deeper water tables could reduce the availability of a permanent water source for riparian trees and therefore lead to water stress naumburg et al 2005 wang et al 2019a therefore water stress and oxygen stress resulting from fluctuated wtd had a great effect on riparian tree water uptake patterns specifically higher water tables without evident fluctuations generally killed flooded roots because most species cannot tolerate the associated low oxygen levels naumburg et al 2005 li et al 2019 the appropriately decreasing water tables benefited plant species from avoiding oxygen stress but the excessive water table decline probably resulted in plant water stress naumburg et al 2005 li et al 2019 our findings suggested that 2 1 m was the optimum wtd to utilize the deep water sources for the riparian trees development in the face of drought and oxygen scarce environment 4 2 relationship between riparian tree water uptake depth and water use efficiency it was evident that there were tradeoff and coordination between plant water uptake depth and wue near rivers because significant difference of wue was observed in riparian trees among the four plots at different distances from the riverbank at three sites with various root water uptake patterns figs 5 6 and 7 plants with shallow root water uptake depths such as s babylonica at deep wtd at site a mainly relied on upper soil water which was subjected to fast evaporation loss fig 5a and 6a they generally had rapid water resource capture and large transpiration rates ding et al 2020 nie et al 2019 antunes et al 2018 leading to lower leaf δ13c and wue values fig 5a and 7 moreover the increase in shallow soil water contributions was linked to the obviously decreasing leaf δ13c and wue values as the distance from the riverbank increased from 5 m to 20 m at deep wtd site fig 5a and 7 when the riparian trees primarily depended on deep water sources in fluctuated shallow wtd area such as s babylonica at site b leaf δ13c and wue increased significantly particularly at the lowering of the water table fig 5b and 7 the increasing deep water contributions accompanied with growing leaf δ13c and wue were further found along the distance away from riverbank at high water table site with evident fluctuations this could be likely due to that stomatal conductance and transpiration rate reduced with the decreasing deep soil moisture to avoid hydraulic failure and drought stress klein et al 2013 martinez vilalta and garcia forner 2017 ding et al 2020 pezeshki et al 1998 and li et al 2006 also indicated that the anoxia could reduce the plant stomatal conductance and transpiration rate our findings confirmed that deep root water uptake and leaf transpiration rate of riparian trees in anaerobiosis environment were restricted under the constant shallow wtd condition fig 5c and 7 the relationship between the riparian tree water uptake depth and wue was not quantified in previous studies as shown in fig 9 a this study clarified that the leaf δ13c was significantly negatively correlated with the contributions of upper soil water in 0 80 cm layer r2 0 47 p 0 001 meanwhile significantly positive relationships were found between leaf δ13c and contributions of deep water below 80 cm depth r2 0 42 p 0 001 fig 9b these linear relationships indicated that increasing reliance on upper soil water sources linearly declined the leaf δ13c and wue of riparian trees fig 9a while the growing dependence on deeper water sources proportionally increased the wue of riparian trees fig 9b riparian trees mainly relied on upper soil water sources fed by recent precipitation in wet season dawson and pate 1996 wang et al 2019a the easier soil water accessibility stimulated riparian trees to maximize their growth and transpiration during the rainy season which resulted in the lower wue and water use without water limitation cao et al 2020 wu et al 2021 deep water was critical for plant water use and growth especially under drought stress cao et al 2020 however the main root water uptake depth shift from shallow layers towards deep layers i e increasing reliance on deeper water sources generally caused riparian trees to consume more energy due to new deep root growth longer water transport path and greater water transport resistance of deep roots cao et al 2020 therefore riparian trees used deeper water effectively and conservatively through stomatal closure and the lowering of transpiration rate leading to higher leaf δ13c and wue values it agreed well with previous studies that the root water uptake depth adjustments towards deeper layers during dry season could cause a 13 reduction of the total annual transpiration and a 15 increase of the wue of evergreen ligustrum lucidum wu et al 2021 4 3 implications and further scopes of this study this study indicated that riparian deep rooted trees were strongly dependent on shallow soil water recharged by precipitation and remained high transpiration rates low wue under deep wtd the continuously large plant water consumption could result in a dried upper soil layer especially during drought season increasing the risk of canopy defoliation mortality and degradation of riparian trees nie et al 2014 wang and d odorico 2019 ding et al 2020 large scale afforestation will not be recommended in this area while shallow rooted herbs with less vulnerable to drought and lower water demand for transpiration may be suitable for vegetation restoration in the riparian zone a shift of shallow and deep root water uptake depths with higher wue could help riparian trees acclimate to decreasing deep water accessibilities under fluctuated shallow wtd dawson and pate 1996 wang et al 2019a moreover the higher wue of riparian trees was generally linked to reducing water consumption for transpiration without affecting plant growth and maintaining reserving riverflow and groundwater level which benefited for balancing the growth of riparian trees and bank storage to avoid loss of riverflow vanderklein et al 2014 barbeta et al 2015 missik et al 2019 mkunyana et al 2019 when the water table continously declined and wtd exceeded 2 1 m deep water contributions to riparian trees as well as wue decreased indicating that the ability to cope with drought stress decreased in comparison deep root development of trees was inhibited and photosynthetic transpiration decreased due to anaerobiosis when the water table kept high without evident fluctuation therefore the optimum wtd of 2 1 m for best growth of riparian trees was recommended under shallow wtd condition the sustainability of riparian afforestation must consider both root water uptake depths and plant physiological traits this study provides a critical insight into evaluating the riparian plant water relations along a losing river however several issues still require further investigations firstly the stable isotopes should be combined with measurements of root distribution and transpiration rate under more water table conditions in different represent years i e dry normal and wet year to further analyze the plant water relationships secondly whether there is a water use competition between trees shrubs and herbs in the riparian zone is unclear it is valuable to compare the water use characteristics among various riparian species in response to different losing river water groundwater interactions thirdly numerical simulation model can be combined with stable isotopes to trace the transport of water isotopes in groundwater soil plant atmosphere continuum and determine the dynamic characteristics of plant water use simunek and hopmans 2009 zhou et al 2021 5 conclusions in this study the water use characteristics of deep rooted s babylonica in the riparian zone under various wtds along a losing river were determined by the stable isotopes δ2h and δ18o in water as well as leaf δ13c and mixsiar model our results indicated that the seasonal water uptake patterns and wue of riparian s babylonica were significantly affected by wtd riparian trees accessed more upper soil water and had lower leaf δ13c under deep wtd about 20 m compared to those under shallow wtd 2 5 m a shift of shallow and deep root water uptake depths with higher wue helped riparian trees adapt decreasing deep water accessibilities under fluctuated shallow wtd 1 9 0 4 m nevertheless deep root water uptake capabilities and transpiration rate were limited when the water table kept high without evident fluctuation 1 5 0 1 m both the water source contributions in upper layer 0 80 cm and deep layer below 80 cm depth were parabolic functions of wtd p 0 05 when groundwater was shallow leaf δ13c had a positive linear correlation with proportional contribution of deep water p 0 001 it seemed that 2 1 m was the optimum wtd for riparian trees under shallow wtd since they could make best use of deep water sources and remained the highest wue under water deficit the higher wue of riparian trees was advantageous for balancing plant water use and bank storage to avoid large loss of river flow however large scale afforestation will not be recommended in the area with deep wtd which may result in a dried upper soil layer especially during drought season and increase the risk of degradation of riparian trees the sustainability of riparian vegetation restoration should consider both the development of root water uptake depths and physiological traits of plants under different water table conditions credit authorship contribution statement yue li methodology formal analysis investigation writing original draft ying ma conceptualization methodology formal analysis

3243,rivers losing flow into surrounding aquifers losing rivers are common under changing climates and groundwater overexploitation the riparian plant water relations under various water table dynamics along a losing river remain unclear in this study the water isotopes δ2h and δ18o leaf δ13c and mixsiar model were used combinedly for determining the root water uptake patterns and leaf water use efficiency wue of salix babylonica l at three sites a b and c with different water table depths wtds in the riparian zone of jian and chaobai river in beijing china the correlations of water source contributions with wtd and wue were quantified the riparian s babylonica primarily took up upper 0 80 cm soil water 71 5 with the lowest leaf δ13c 28 8 1 1 at site a under deep wtd 20 5 0 5 m in contrast deep water below 80 cm depth including groundwater contributed 55 1 to s babylonica at site b with fluctuated shallow wtd 1 9 0 4 m where leaf δ13c was highest 27 9 1 0 the s babylonica mainly used soil water in 30 170 cm layer 56 9 with mean leaf δ13c of 28 2 0 7 at site c with stable shallow wtd 1 5 0 1 m it was found that both the contributions of upper soil water in 0 80 cm and deep water below 80 cm had significantly quadratic correlations with wtd under shallow water table conditions p 0 05 leaf δ13c was negatively correlated with contributions of upper soil water above 80 cm depth but it was positively related to the contributions of deep water below 80 cm in linear functions p 0 001 the results indicated that 2 1 m was the optimum wtd for riparian trees because they maximized the use of deep water sources to get the highest wue this study provides insights into managing groundwater surface water resources and riparian afforestation in losing rivers keywords root water uptake pattern water use efficiency water table depth stable isotopes riparian s babylonica losing river 1 introduction many rivers are drying up under warming climates and groundwater overexploitation worldwide which causes serious decline of water table and degradation of riparian vegetation rood et al 2003 garcia et al 2017 ecological water e g excess surface flow or reclaimed water has been widely used to recharge dry rivers in recent years long et al 2020 he et al 2021 widespread loss of riverflow into underlying aquifers occurs where groundwater levels lie below nearby rivers losing rivers winter et al 1998 jasechko et al 2021 the recharge process increases the water availability for riparian vegetation and various species have been planted to restore the riparian ecosystem however increased plant transpiration was linked to reduced riverflow and groundwater level vanderklein et al 2014 missik et al 2019 mkunyana et al 2019 although some studies claimed that transpiration was not closely coupled to riverflow mcdonald et al 2015 therefore investigating the water use characteristics of riparian species is critical to recover the losing rivers especially in water scarce regions it will provide critical insights into managing groundwater and surface water resources as well as riparian afforestation under climate change the δ2h and δ18o have been widely applied to identify the root water uptake patterns of riparian plants dawson and ehleringer 1991 wang et al 2019a oerter and bowen 2019 flanagan et al 2019 dawson and ehleringer 1991 utilized deuterium tracer technique to identify that mature trees nearby a perennial stream rarely absorbed the stream water but used water from deeper strata in the wasatch mountains of semiarid western usa however oerter and bowen 2019 revisited the same experimental site in dawson and ehleringer 1991 and demonstrated that soil water was the primary source for these streamside trees via the in situ soil water vapor isotope measurements applying the stable isotope δ2h and δ18o tracer technique several studies concluded that the distances away from the riverbank as well as seasonal variations of climate could significantly affect water uptake patterns of riparian trees for example ripairan trees at distances 5 15 m from the riverbank substantially depended on soil water and groundwater for plant transpiration without water absorpton from the nearby river water throughout the growing season mensforth et al 1994 qian et al 2017 wang et al 2019a shallow soil water recharged by recent precipitation was generally used as the primary water source for riparian plants during wet season whereas deep soil water and groundwater were principal in dry season dawson and pate 1996 wang et al 2019a in particular groundwater is perceived as a reliable and continuous water source for deep rooted riparian trees indicated by consistent water isotopes of stems and groundwater barbeta and penuelas 2017 li et al 2019 the water table depth wtd has great effects on riparian plant water use nippert et al 2010 chen et al 2016 jasechko et al 2021 chen et al 2016 found that desert riparian species under the wtd of 1 8 m used a mixture of soil water below 75 cm depth groundwater and river water once the wtd increased to 3 8 m and 7 2 m species mainly relied on deeper soil water below 150 cm and even groundwater majority of studies indicated that the increasing wtd induced water uptake pattern adjustments towards deeper water sources barbeta et al 2015 chen et al 2016 li et al 2019 nevertheless some studies argued that riparian trees switched their water sources from groundwater to vadose zone soil water in response to the water table decline nippert et al 2010 busch et al 1992 riparian species might change root distributions and develop plastic water uptake patterns in order to acclimate to the variable wtds horton et al 2001 therefore it is necessary to investigate the water uptake patterns for riparian trees under various water table conditions furthermore little is known about the quantitative relationship between the wtd and root water uptake patterns of the riparian plants the shift of water sources for riparian plants is mainly driven by leaf transpiration leaf water use efficiency wue defining as the ratio of photosynthetic rate and transpiration rate is a crucial indicator to reflect plant water use characteristics farquhar et al 1989 wang et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 the plant leaf δ13c is positively correlated with intrinsic wue especially for c3 plants and it can be used as an indicator of wue wang et al 2019b a growing numbers of evidence showed that plants with higher dependence on deeper water sources were generally linked to higher wue and survive drought more successfully picon cochard et al 2001 liu et al 2017 ding et al 2020 the wue of arid and semi arid deep rooted plant species was observed to increase with deeper wtd si et al 2015 whereas antunes et al 2018 found that there was no response of wue to increasing wtd for the semi arid dimorphic rooted conifer trees it can be found that most of above studies are located in arid and semi arid areas it is still uncertain how wue of riparian plants coordinates with root water uptake patterns under different wtd conditions in losing rivers the aim of this study was to identify and understand water strategies of deep rooted riparian trees along gradients of wtd using stable isotopes δ2h δ18o and δ13c together with the mixsiar model focusing on rivers in beijing china the objectives of this study were 1 to quantify the seasonal water uptake patterns for riparian trees under different wtds and distances away from the riverbank 2 to compare the leaf wue of riparian trees under different wtds and distances away from the riverbank 3 to determine the quantitative relationships of water uptake patterns with wtd and leaf wue these results will provide insights on riparian ecosystem and water resources management of losing rivers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and field measurements the experiments of salix babylonica l were conducted from may to november in 2019 in the riverside of the jian and chaobai river beijing china 40 07 30 n 116 40 37 e fig 1 a sub humid monsoon climate with mean temperature of 11 5 c and mean relative humidity rhu of 60 is dominant in this study area the multi year 1961 2021 average precipitation is 532 mm with 84 5 of which occurring at the rainy season during june 15 and september 15 fig 2 in comparison the total precipitation in 2019 was 445 6 mm with 73 9 of which concentrated on the rainy season fig 2 thus 2019 was identified as a dry year based on the multi year 1961 2021 rainfall frequency curve the jian and chaobai river were dried up between 1999 and 2007 and have been recharged with ecological water since 2007 s babylonica with deep roots was one of the most widespread planted riparian species in the study area the maximum rooting depth of s babylonica can reach about 4 m and vary with different water tables ferro et al 2003 three representative sites a b and c with different wtds were selected along the jian and chaobai river fig 1 at each site four plots planted with s babylonica at distance of 5 m 10 m 20 m and 45 m away from the riverbank d05 d10 d20 and d45 respectively were constructed for field measurements and sample collections fig 1 a tilting rain gauge of 0 2 mm per tip sl3 1 shanghai meteorological instrument shanghai china was used to record daily precipitation in the meteorological observation station fig 1 the river water level nearby each site was monitored using a doppler open channel flowmeter hoh l 01 king water co ltd beijing china the groundwater level was measured once a month using a pressure type groundwater stage gauge hoh s y king water co ltd beijing china placed in the monitoring wells the river water level was observed to fluctuate at 28 4 29 4 27 9 28 9 and 26 5 27 3 m nearby the sites a b and c respectively fig 2a the wtd at site a 20 5 m 0 5 m was significantly p 0 01 deeper than the other two sites b 1 9 m 0 4 m and c 1 5 m 0 1 m the wtd fluctuation was more significant at site b compared with the stable wtd at site c fig 2b 2 2 sample collection six field campaigns were conducted to collect water samples of river groundwater precipitation soil and stem for δ2h and δ18o measurements as well as plant leaf samples for δ13c analysis on may 5 june 14 july 26 august 15 september 26 and november 5 river water nearby each site was sampled by means of a hydrophore while a sucking pump was used to collect groundwater in monitoring wells precipitation was sampled using a device consisted of a polyethylene bottle a funnel and plastic ball during the observation period sun et al 2019 one riparian s babylonica with diameter of 23 3 cm at breast height in each plot was selected to measure the water stable isotopes in stem and leaf δ13c fig 1 several suberized and mature stems were sampled from each s babylonica and removed the phloem and bark to prevent isotopic contamination stems were put into 12 ml glass vials and kept refrigerated before stem water extraction and isotope analysis mature foliage approximately 50 leaves from branches at similar heights 4 5 m of s babylonica tree was collected for plant leaf δ13c analysis the collected leaves were oven dried at 65 c for at least 64 h until they reached a constant mass on the day of sampling subsequently leaf samples were ground into fine powder and sieved using a 0 15 mm mesh screen soil cores within 1 m of each s babylonica tree in the four plots were obtained by a power auger chpd78 christie engineering company sydney australia the soil samples were collected at depths of 0 5 5 10 10 15 15 20 20 30 30 40 40 60 60 80 90 110 150 170 190 210 250 270 and 280 300 cm they were removed roots put into 12 ml glass vials and kept frozen in a refrigerator before soil water extraction and isotope analysis soil was also sampled to measure the gravimetric soil water content swc using the oven dry method at the same depths listed above 2 3 isotopic analyses water in stem and soil samples was extracted using the automatic cryogenic vacuum distillation system li 2100 lica beijing china the whole extraction progress lasted for 3 h and the extraction efficiency was all up to 99 to ensure no isotopic fractionation the isotopic ratio infrared spectroscopy iris system dlt 100 los gatos research mountain view usa was applied to measure the δ2h and δ18o in precipitation river water soil water and groundwater to avoid the organic contaminants during iris measurements the isotopic composition of stem water was analyzed using the isotope ratio mass spectrometry irms system mat253 thermo fisher scientific bremen germany the measuring precisions of both iris and irms system were 1 for δ2h and 0 1 for δ18o in different water samples respectively the measured δ2h and δ18o were then calibrated with the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow sun et al 2019 zhao and wang 2021 there was no significant difference in δ2h and δ18o measurements for soil water groundwater precipitation and river water analyzed by the irms and iris systems li et al 2021 the δ13c in plant leaf was measured using the irms system mat253 thermo fisher scientific bremen germany with a precision of 0 15 the measured δ13c in plant leaf was calibrated with the vienna pee dee belemnite v pdb 2 4 mixsiar model the mixsiar model v3 1 stock and semmens 2016 coupled with δ2h and δ18o isotopes was applied to identify the potential water source contributions to riparian s babylonica because the wtd was much deeper than the maximum rooting depth of s babylonica trees at site a groundwater could not be taken up by trees in light of the water isotopic composition and swc distributions in the profile soil water in the four layers of 0 30 30 80 80 170 and 170 300 cm were classified as the potential water sources of s babylonica trees at site a since water isotopic values of groundwater were similar to those of soil water in the 170 300 cm layer they had been merged into one potential water source soil water in 170 300 cm layer besides the soil water sources in the 0 30 cm 30 80 cm and 80 170 cm layers for s babylonica trees under shallow wtd sites b 1 9 m 0 4 m and c 1 5 m 0 1 m these isotopic compositions of potential water sources were referred as source data in the mixsiar model while the mixture data was set as the δ2h corrected by potential water source line pwl correction method li et al 2021 and raw δ18o in stem water more details about the mixsiar model parameter settings were given in li et al 2021 2 5 statistical analysis the seasonal differences in the isotopes of different water bodies swc proportional contributions of water sources and plant leaf δ13c values among the three sites as well as those among the four plots at different distances away from the riverbank were evaluated by the one way analysis of variance anova incorporating with post hoc tukey s kolmogorov smirnov and levene s tests p 0 05 sun et al 2018 regression analyses were performed to quantify the relationships of water source contributions with wtd and plant leaf δ13c values all statistical analyses were conducted with the spss 24 0 software spss inc usa 3 results 3 1 variations of soil water contents and isotopes in different waters the swc in different soil layers varied greatly with sampling campaigns and distances away from the riverbank among the sites a b and c fig 3 the swc values in upper 0 80 cm layer were significantly higher at site a than other two sites throughout the observation period p 0 001 however the swc in 170 300 cm layer at site a was much lower with significantly seasonal variations compared with other two sites p 0 001 a significant decrease of swc was observed from may 0 32 g g 1 to july 0 09 g g 1 in 170 300 cm layer at site a the swc in 80 170 cm layer was lower but changed greatly with seasons standard deviation of 0 8 g g 1 at site b than other two sites furthermore no significant difference in swc in 0 80 cm layer was found among four distances at site a p 0 05 but decreasing swc was found in 170 300 cm layer from d05 to d45 fig s1 the swc in 80 170 cm layer decreased from d05 to d45 at site b there was no significant difference in swc distributions among the four distances at site c p 0 98 fig s1 the isotopes in groundwater at site a mean of 71 1 for δ2h and 10 2 for δ18o were significantly more depleted than those of groundwater at sites b mean of 58 9 for δ2h and 7 6 for δ18o and c mean of 59 4 for δ2h and 7 7 for δ18o p 0 01 fig 4 and table s1 there was no significant difference in the isotopic compositions of river water among the three sites p 0 05 it was obvious that the δ2h and δ18o in river water were much more enriched than those in groundwater at all the three sites p 0 05 fig 4 and table s1 the isotopic compositions of soil water had no significant difference in the 0 80 cm layer among the three sites p 0 96 but they were more enriched below 80 cm at sites b and c compared with those at site a p 0 05 the slopes of soil water line swl at sites b and c were much lower than those at site a indicating stronger soil water evaporation at sites b and c no significant difference in isotopic values of soil water was observed among four plots d05 d10 d20 d45 at site a p 0 83 the δ2h and δ18o in soil water in the 80 170 cm layer were gradually depleted from d05 to d45 during june and august at site b while they increased from d05 to d20 but then decreased in plot d45 at site c fig 4 and table s1 the slope of swl gradually increased with the increase of distance away from the riverbank at the three sites suggesting a decrease of soil water evaporation from d05 to d45 the stem water isotopes at sites a and c were slightly depleted than those at site b fig 4 and table s1 δ2h and δ18o in stem water gradually enriched from d05 to d20 at sites a and c whereas they were depleted from d05 to d45 at site b 3 2 seasonal and spatial variations in root water uptake patterns the water uptake patterns of riparian s babylonica were strongly different among the three sites figs 5 and 6 s babylonica primarily took up upper soil water in 0 80 cm layer with mean contributions of 71 5 throughout the observation period at site a with deep wtd fig 5a and 6a the soil water below 80 cm depth primarily contributed to s babylonica with proportions 55 1 at site b with fluctuated shallow wtd fig 5b and 6b in comparison the main water source of s babylonica at site c under shallow wtd without significant fluctuation was soil water in 30 170 cm layer with mean contributions of 56 9 throughout the observation period fig 5c and 6c s babylonica at site a absorbed particularly more soil water in 0 30 cm layer 44 2 than sites b 20 7 and c 22 8 p 0 01 moreover the proportional contributions of soil water in 170 300 cm layer or groundwater to s babylonica were significantly different among sites a 13 6 b 28 3 and c 18 3 p 0 01 fig 6 the contributions of potential water sources to s babylonica exhibited significantly seasonal differences among the three sties p 0 05 a decrease of the soil water contribution below 80 cm depth associated with an increase in 0 80 cm layer was shown with the growth of s babylonica trees at site a fig 5a the soil water contribution in 80 170 cm layer to s babylonica decreased significantly 21

0 05 s babylonica trees at site c kept reducing the water uptake proportions in 30 80 cm layer from may 46 7 to november 17 7 while groundwater contributions increased by 10 7 fig 5c p 0 05 although significant seasonal differences in riparian tree water uptake depths were observed p 0 05 there was no general and significant correlation between environmental factors e g air temperature rhu and precipitation and upper soil water 0 80 cm contribution to riparian trees at the three sites p 0 05 fig s2 the water use characteristics of s babylonica varied distinctly along the distance away from the riverbank at the three sites the superficial 0 30 cm soil water contributions increased significantly by 23 0 from d05 to d20 p 0 05 whereas deep 170 300 cm soil water contributions to s babylonica reduced by 6 4 from d05 to d45 at site a fig 6a the s babylonica took up more groundwater but less soil water in 80 170 cm layer from d05 to d45 at site b fig 6b in particular the groundwater contribution to s babylonica at d20 and d45 significantly increased by an average of 14 4 when the water table declined from 1 7 m to 2 5 m at site b p 0 05 on the contrary s babylonica reduced water absorption 47 3 from deep water below 80 cm but accessed more upper soil water 28 6 significantly p 0 05 in response to the 0 8 m decline of wtd at d05 and d10 at site b p 0 05 at site c the contributions of deep water below 80 cm depth reduced remarkably 20 2 from d05 to d45 whereas the upper soil water increased the contributions 14 1 to s babylonica from d05 to d20 fig 6c p 0 05 3 3 changes in leaf δ13c of riparian trees the leaf δ13c values at the three sites varied differently with increasing distance from the riverbank during the observation period fig 7 riparian trees at site a had significantly lower leaf δ13c values mean of 28 8 than those at the other two sites b mean of 27 9 and c mean of 28 1 p 0 05 there was a significant decrease of leaf δ13c value 2 3 from d05 to d20 at site a p 0 05 however the δ13c values generally increased with increasing distance from the riverbank ranging from 28 8 at d05 to 27 0 at d45 at site b it was found that the leaves of s babylonica at d20 and d45 had significantly higher δ13c values mean of 27 1 than those at other two distances mean of 28 7 at site b p 0 05 the leaf δ13c of the s babylonica nearest the riverbank mean of 27 6 at d05 at site c was higher than that at other distances mean of 28 4 fig 7 significant seasonal differences in the leaf δ13c values were shown among the three sites p 0 05 table s2 the δ13c values in the tree leaves were the lowest in may mean of 28 7 and august mean of 28 7 the leaf δ13c in plot d05 at site c showed an increasing trend with the growth of s babylonica compared with that at sites a and b table s2 nevertheless no significant regression relationship between leaf δ13c value of s babylonica and environment factors e g air temperature rhu and precipitation was observed at the tree sites p 0 05 fig s3 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of water table depth on riparian tree water uptake pattern this study indicated that the depth and fluctuation of water table diversified the water uptake patterns of riparian trees near the losing river naumburg et al 2005 simunek and hopmans 2009 fan et al 2017 antunes et al 2018 it agreed well with previous studies that riparian trees primarily took up soil water in upper 0 80 cm layer under deep wtd with weaker hydraulic connections between the river and underlying groundwater system fig 5a and 6a wu et al 2021 an evident shift of the main water uptake depth of riparian trees from soil water in 30 80 cm layer towards deeper soil layers or groundwater was found when the wtd increased from 1 5 0 1 m to 1 9 0 4 m under shallow wtd condition with closer river water groundwater interactions in this study fig 5b 5c 6b and 6c it suggested that the deep root growth and their water uptake capabilities were limited under shallow wtd without significant fluctuations 1 5 0 1 m fig 5c and 6c or oxygen stress conditions naumburg et al 2005 fan et al 2017 nevertheless riparian trees could gradually acclimate to persistently shallow wtd environment with plant growth indicated by an increase of groundwater utilization 10 7 for riparian trees from may to november fig 5c and 6c naumburg et al 2005 in addition these riparian trees closer to the stream generally had better ability to adapt to oxygen stress which could be derived from the decreasing deep water contributions along the distance away from riverbank fig 6c fluctuated shallow wtd could motivate riparian trees to develop a dimorphic root system and switch their water main uptake depths between the shallow soil layers and deep layers fig 5b and 6b zencich et al 2002 but the responses to water table decline of riparian trees at different distances at fluctuated wtd area differed significantly with reducing water absorption from deep water below 80 cm at distance within 10 m and increasing groundwater utilization at distance of 20 m and 45 m away from the riverbank fig 5b and 6b the stimulation of deep roots helped riparian trees susceptible to drought stress at distance 20 m from the riverbank survive from the climate drought ehleringer and dawson 1992 antunes et al 2018 li et al 2019 or river water level lowering during rainy season as shown in this study fig 3c and 5b the quantitative relationship between the shallow wtd and contributions of different water sources to riparian trees was not discovered in previous studies in our study a significantly quadratic relationship was found between the wtd and proportional contributions of upper soil water in 0 80 cm layer r2 0 43 p 0 05 at shallow wtd areas sites b and c fig 8 a meanwhile the wtd had a significant quadratic correlation with deep water contributions below 80 cm depth r2 0 43 p 0 05 fig 8b particularly riparian s babylonica at constant shallow wtd sites wtd 1 7 m increased deep water absorption with increasing wtd whereas those under fluctuated shallow wtd 1 7 2 5 m showed an increase and then decrease of deep water contribution as water table declined fig 8b the upper soil water contribution was minimum at the wtd of 2 1 m when the deep water contribution reached a maximum value it could be explained that declining water tables wtd increased from 1 5 m to 2 1 m aerated deep soil layers benefited for new deep root exploitation and further stimulated riparian trees to utilize deep water when groundwater severely restricted the active root zone of riparian trees under oxygen stress naumburg et al 2005 however riparian trees can tolerate declining water table only up to a species specific threshold value beyond which drought stress occurred sperry et al 1998 in this study when the wtd exceeded 2 1 m deeper water tables could reduce the availability of a permanent water source for riparian trees and therefore lead to water stress naumburg et al 2005 wang et al 2019a therefore water stress and oxygen stress resulting from fluctuated wtd had a great effect on riparian tree water uptake patterns specifically higher water tables without evident fluctuations generally killed flooded roots because most species cannot tolerate the associated low oxygen levels naumburg et al 2005 li et al 2019 the appropriately decreasing water tables benefited plant species from avoiding oxygen stress but the excessive water table decline probably resulted in plant water stress naumburg et al 2005 li et al 2019 our findings suggested that 2 1 m was the optimum wtd to utilize the deep water sources for the riparian trees development in the face of drought and oxygen scarce environment 4 2 relationship between riparian tree water uptake depth and water use efficiency it was evident that there were tradeoff and coordination between plant water uptake depth and wue near rivers because significant difference of wue was observed in riparian trees among the four plots at different distances from the riverbank at three sites with various root water uptake patterns figs 5 6 and 7 plants with shallow root water uptake depths such as s babylonica at deep wtd at site a mainly relied on upper soil water which was subjected to fast evaporation loss fig 5a and 6a they generally had rapid water resource capture and large transpiration rates ding et al 2020 nie et al 2019 antunes et al 2018 leading to lower leaf δ13c and wue values fig 5a and 7 moreover the increase in shallow soil water contributions was linked to the obviously decreasing leaf δ13c and wue values as the distance from the riverbank increased from 5 m to 20 m at deep wtd site fig 5a and 7 when the riparian trees primarily depended on deep water sources in fluctuated shallow wtd area such as s babylonica at site b leaf δ13c and wue increased significantly particularly at the lowering of the water table fig 5b and 7 the increasing deep water contributions accompanied with growing leaf δ13c and wue were further found along the distance away from riverbank at high water table site with evident fluctuations this could be likely due to that stomatal conductance and transpiration rate reduced with the decreasing deep soil moisture to avoid hydraulic failure and drought stress klein et al 2013 martinez vilalta and garcia forner 2017 ding et al 2020 pezeshki et al 1998 and li et al 2006 also indicated that the anoxia could reduce the plant stomatal conductance and transpiration rate our findings confirmed that deep root water uptake and leaf transpiration rate of riparian trees in anaerobiosis environment were restricted under the constant shallow wtd condition fig 5c and 7 the relationship between the riparian tree water uptake depth and wue was not quantified in previous studies as shown in fig 9 a this study clarified that the leaf δ13c was significantly negatively correlated with the contributions of upper soil water in 0 80 cm layer r2 0 47 p 0 001 meanwhile significantly positive relationships were found between leaf δ13c and contributions of deep water below 80 cm depth r2 0 42 p 0 001 fig 9b these linear relationships indicated that increasing reliance on upper soil water sources linearly declined the leaf δ13c and wue of riparian trees fig 9a while the growing dependence on deeper water sources proportionally increased the wue of riparian trees fig 9b riparian trees mainly relied on upper soil water sources fed by recent precipitation in wet season dawson and pate 1996 wang et al 2019a the easier soil water accessibility stimulated riparian trees to maximize their growth and transpiration during the rainy season which resulted in the lower wue and water use without water limitation cao et al 2020 wu et al 2021 deep water was critical for plant water use and growth especially under drought stress cao et al 2020 however the main root water uptake depth shift from shallow layers towards deep layers i e increasing reliance on deeper water sources generally caused riparian trees to consume more energy due to new deep root growth longer water transport path and greater water transport resistance of deep roots cao et al 2020 therefore riparian trees used deeper water effectively and conservatively through stomatal closure and the lowering of transpiration rate leading to higher leaf δ13c and wue values it agreed well with previous studies that the root water uptake depth adjustments towards deeper layers during dry season could cause a 13 reduction of the total annual transpiration and a 15 increase of the wue of evergreen ligustrum lucidum wu et al 2021 4 3 implications and further scopes of this study this study indicated that riparian deep rooted trees were strongly dependent on shallow soil water recharged by precipitation and remained high transpiration rates low wue under deep wtd the continuously large plant water consumption could result in a dried upper soil layer especially during drought season increasing the risk of canopy defoliation mortality and degradation of riparian trees nie et al 2014 wang and d odorico 2019 ding et al 2020 large scale afforestation will not be recommended in this area while shallow rooted herbs with less vulnerable to drought and lower water demand for transpiration may be suitable for vegetation restoration in the riparian zone a shift of shallow and deep root water uptake depths with higher wue could help riparian trees acclimate to decreasing deep water accessibilities under fluctuated shallow wtd dawson and pate 1996 wang et al 2019a moreover the higher wue of riparian trees was generally linked to reducing water consumption for transpiration without affecting plant growth and maintaining reserving riverflow and groundwater level which benefited for balancing the growth of riparian trees and bank storage to avoid loss of riverflow vanderklein et al 2014 barbeta et al 2015 missik et al 2019 mkunyana et al 2019 when the water table continously declined and wtd exceeded 2 1 m deep water contributions to riparian trees as well as wue decreased indicating that the ability to cope with drought stress decreased in comparison deep root development of trees was inhibited and photosynthetic transpiration decreased due to anaerobiosis when the water table kept high without evident fluctuation therefore the optimum wtd of 2 1 m for best growth of riparian trees was recommended under shallow wtd condition the sustainability of riparian afforestation must consider both root water uptake depths and plant physiological traits this study provides a critical insight into evaluating the riparian plant water relations along a losing river however several issues still require further investigations firstly the stable isotopes should be combined with measurements of root distribution and transpiration rate under more water table conditions in different represent years i e dry normal and wet year to further analyze the plant water relationships secondly whether there is a water use competition between trees shrubs and herbs in the riparian zone is unclear it is valuable to compare the water use characteristics among various riparian species in response to different losing river water groundwater interactions thirdly numerical simulation model can be combined with stable isotopes to trace the transport of water isotopes in groundwater soil plant atmosphere continuum and determine the dynamic characteristics of plant water use simunek and hopmans 2009 zhou et al 2021 5 conclusions in this study the water use characteristics of deep rooted s babylonica in the riparian zone under various wtds along a losing river were determined by the stable isotopes δ2h and δ18o in water as well as leaf δ13c and mixsiar model our results indicated that the seasonal water uptake patterns and wue of riparian s babylonica were significantly affected by wtd riparian trees accessed more upper soil water and had lower leaf δ13c under deep wtd about 20 m compared to those under shallow wtd 2 5 m a shift of shallow and deep root water uptake depths with higher wue helped riparian trees adapt decreasing deep water accessibilities under fluctuated shallow wtd 1 9 0 4 m nevertheless deep root water uptake capabilities and transpiration rate were limited when the water table kept high without evident fluctuation 1 5 0 1 m both the water source contributions in upper layer 0 80 cm and deep layer below 80 cm depth were parabolic functions of wtd p 0 05 when groundwater was shallow leaf δ13c had a positive linear correlation with proportional contribution of deep water p 0 001 it seemed that 2 1 m was the optimum wtd for riparian trees under shallow wtd since they could make best use of deep water sources and remained the highest wue under water deficit the higher wue of riparian trees was advantageous for balancing plant water use and bank storage to avoid large loss of river flow however large scale afforestation will not be recommended in the area with deep wtd which may result in a dried upper soil layer especially during drought season and increase the risk of degradation of riparian trees the sustainability of riparian vegetation restoration should consider both the development of root water uptake depths and physiological traits of plants under different water table conditions credit authorship contribution statement yue li methodology formal analysis investigation writing original draft ying ma conceptualization methodology formal analysis

3244,the risks associated with estrogens in detectable concentrations in the aquatic environment underscore the need to best manage the release of estrogenic compounds modeling work can effectively help to understand the variation of estrogens in the natural water bodies at low costs this study developed a modeling framework based on the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf code to simulate the fate and transport of three dominant estrogens estrone e1 17β estradiol e2β and 17α estradiol e2α in surface water by integrating their excretion transport interconversion and attenuation processes this work focused on estrogens from sewage systems failing septic systems grazing animals and manure land application the developed modeling framework was applied to the redwood river watershed in minnesota to model the in stream estradiol equivalents eeqs the modeled eeqs were comparable to the values measured at three sampling sites along the redwood river in 2007 the modeling results indicate that wastewater treatment plant discharges elevate estrogen levels on dry days and surface runoff caused by storms or snow melting after the manure land application and or cattle grazing can drastically spike eeqs levels suggesting the application of buffer stripes and manure storage composting for estrogen control the case study shows that the modeling framework can be used to characterize the temporal and spatial variation of estrogens in streams evaluate their risk to aquatic animals and determine the best management practices for estrogen control keywords estrogen attenuation interconversion fate and transport hspf 1 introduction steroid estrogens mainly including estrone e1 17β estradiol e2β 17α estradiol e2α 17α ethynylestradiol ee2 and estriol e3 impair the sexual development of aquatic animals such as zebrafish and trout in detectable concentrations in the aquatic environment larsson et al 1999 brion et al 2004 concentrated animal feeding operations cafos wastewater treatment plants wwtps and failing septic systems release estrogens into receiving water and cause the levels of estrogens to rise downstream through effluents and sediments lange et al 2002 schoenecker et al 2004 minnesota pollution control agency 2011 additionally e2β is identified as a degradation product of e2α lee liu 2002 robinson et al 2017 to minimize the potential risks caused by estrogens to aquatic animals it is quite important to assess variation patterns of estrogens in the surface water and determine the best management practices bmps for them even though several studies have been conducted to explore the distribution patterns of estrogens they all have some limitations on site measurement studies usually cannot obtain sufficient data to draw a whole picture for estrogen distribution characteristics conley et al 2017 also most estrogen samplings are conducted in the influents and effluents of wwtps and the surface runoff from the agricultural land which are not the typical living environments of aquatic animals atkinson et al 2012 gall et al 2014 gall et al 2015 conversely measurements of estrogens in aquatic systems such as rivers and streams are sporadic making it difficult to quantify the spatial and temporal variations of estrogens soto et al 2004 bradley et al 2009 furthermore the estrogen levels in surface waters are usually quite low or even below the detection limits and are thus hard to be accurately measured bradley et al 2009 dynamic models are good solutions as simulating estrogens can help to understand the variation of estrogens in the natural water bodies at low costs several studies have been conducted to develop such models on large scales grill et al 2018 predicted in stream concentrations of e1 e2β and e3 at the scale of the entire mainland china using a vector based river routing model hydrorout johnson 2010 simulated e1 e2β and ee2 levels in two rivers in the uk based on the mass balance johnson et al 2013 predicted ee2 and e2β concentrations in european rivers using a geographic based water model gwava however those studies considered sewage systems the major estrogen sources and ignored contributions from agricultural activities in another study zhao lung 2017 modeled estrogen levels in the south river in the u s this study considered cafos as an additional major estrogen source but it only focused on e2β and did not work on multiple estrogens addressing the above issues a modeling framework is thus needed to quantify the spatial and temporal estrogen distributions by integrating their excretion transport interconversion and attenuation processes in the system the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf a mathematical model for simulation of watershed hydrology and water quality on a basin scale in one dimensional stream channels is capable to conduct such analysis us epa 2015 the model tracks the fate and transport of water pollutants from point and non point sources in pervious and impervious areas us epa 2015 and it has been widely applied to assess multiple water pollutants including e2β fecal bacteria nutrients pesticides and metals on watershed basin scales ouyang et al 2012 rolle et al 2012 zhao and lung 2018 meshesha et al 2020 risal et al 2021 thus the goal of this study is to develop a modeling framework based on hspf to simulate the levels of three dominant estrogens e1 e2β and e2α and estradiol equivalents eeqs in rivers on a watershed scale integrating their excretion transport interconversion and attenuation processes this framework is aimed at tracking the fate and transport of estrogens from various sources such as human activities agricultural activities and other possible sources this framework can be used to characterize the temporal and spatial variation of estrogens in streams evaluate their risk to aquatic animals and determine the best management practices for estrogen control 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and extent of available data the study site as illustrated in fig 1 is in southwestern minnesota us the redwood river is the main river system in this area this watershed has a total area of 768 km2 and agricultural land accounts for 72 3 of the total area according to the national land cover database nlcd 2011 the land use and area information are summarized in table s1 in supporting information si the hydrography and elevation information was obtained from the united states geological survey usgs tyler wwtp lynd wwtp marshall wwtp russell wwtp and ruthton wwtp are located within the selected watershed and discharge into the redwood river the daily flow rates of the redwood river were measured at a usgs gage 05 315 000 shown as a green triangle in fig 1 and the in stream eeqs were measured at three locations shown as three purple dots in fig 1 along the redwood river in 2007 by lee et al 2014 this redwood watershed was delineated into seven subwatersheds based on the hydrography information elevations and the four points of interest the site of the usgs gage 05 315 000 and the three estrogen sampling sites as a result of the delineation the reach outlet of subwatershed 5 was located at the usgs site and the first estrogen sampling site and the outlets of subwatersheds 6 and 7 were set to be at the other two estrogen sampling sites the livestock populations in each subwatershed were obtained from the minnesota geospatial commons and are summarized in table s5 in si beef cattle dairy cattle and swine are the dominant livestock in this watershed hourly precipitation and air temperature in each subwatershed were obtained from the north american land data assimilation system nldas additional meteorological data including wind speed dew point temperature and cloud cover measured at pipestone municipal airport and southwest minnesota regional airport were obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa other meteorological data including hourly solar radiation evaporation and evapotranspiration were calculated and disaggregated by the wdmutil which is a utility program to manage and store input and output time series data for the hspf cloud cover was originally reported as clear scattered broken or overcast and was converted to a scale ranging from 1 to 10 using the strategy listed in table s2 in si the pipestone municipal airport data was applied to subwatersheds 1 3 and the southwest minnesota regional airport data was applied to subwatersheds 4 7 based on a thiessen polygon analysis 2 2 contributions of estrogens in the redwood river watershed cattle swine septic systems and the five wwtps were identified as primary sources of estrogens in the redwood river watershed according to the u s epa biosolids are applied to less than 1 of the nation s agricultural land it was thus not considered as a major estrogen source in this study in this case study the sources that release estrogens on the land surface were non point sources and the sources that release estrogen directly into surface water were point sources the estrogens released by non point sources can get into surface water from the land surface during storm events in the redwood river watershed cattle and swine manure that is used for land application was a non point source additionally grazing cattle can defecate on pastureland during grazing and release estrogens on the land surface and was thus another non point source conversely failing septic systems and wwtps drainage estrogens directly into the water matrix and were thus analyzed as point sources in this study likewise grazing cattle that directly defecate into streams were also a point source the estrogen mass released from livestock manure was estimated from the livestock population the manure production per animal and the estrogen content in manure the livestock populations were assumed to remain constant throughout the study period for this estimation the estrogens contributed by failing septic systems were quantified from the population that is connected to septic systems the estrogen excretion amount per capita and the failing rate of septic systems the estrogen contributions from the sewage systems can be derived from the estrogens discharged into the sewage systems and the estrogen removal efficiency johnson 2010 according to the data availability the estrogen released from wwtp effluents was estimated from the effluent rates and the measured estrogen concentrations in wwtp effluents zhao lung 2017 the information on each source that was used to quantify the estrogen contributions are listed in table 1 the detailed assumptions and methods for estimating estrogen loads are depicted in section 4 in si 2 3 attenuation transformation and transport of estrogens in the environment in the natural environment estrogens undergo complicated transformation and interconversion processes e1 is usually an intermediate of e2α and e2β attenuation colucci topp 2002 steiner et al 2010 meanwhile e2α and e2β are intermediates of e1 writer et al 2011 zheng et al 2012 the estrogens released from non point sources go through attenuation and degradation before entering the surface water this study assumed that the manure was stored in an anaerobic lagoon for 180 days before the land application edmonds et al 2003 after the land application estrogens within manure go through further degradation and conversion processes on the land surface until they are flushed into streams and rivers by surface runoff those processes during storage in anaerobic lagoons and on the land surface during dry periods were estimated by the model depicted below zhao lung 2021 1 d c a dt k 1 k 3 c a k 1 c b 2 d c b dt k 1 c a k 1 k 2 k 4 c b k 2 c c 3 d c c dt k 3 c a k 2 c b k 2 c c where ca cb and cc are the concentrations or the masses of e2α e1 and e2β respectively t is time k1 is the transformation rate constant of e2α to e1 k 1 is the transformation rate constant of e1 to e2α k2 is the transformation rate constant of e2β to e1 k 2 is the transformation rate constant of e1 to e2β k3 is the transformation rate constant of e2a to e2β and k4 is the transformation rate of e1 to other compounds the transformation and attenuation rates of estrogens during storage were estimated by fitting the eqs 1 to 3 to the measured data in anaerobic lagoons that was obtained from a previous study zheng et al 2012 the dominant soil within the redwood river watershed is a silt clay loam according to web soil survey wss the transformation and attenuation rates of estrogens land surface were thus estimated by fitting the eqs 1 to 3 to the measured data in the silt clay loam soil reported previously mashtare et al 2013 the estimated transformation and degradation rates are summarized in table 2 the degradation and conversions processes are rapid in rivers and it is difficult to measure the transformation and interconversion rate constants used in eqs 1 to 3 campbell et al 2006 zhao lung et al 2019 the estrogen degradation in the surface water was thus simplified as an irreversible process below zheng et al 2012 4 d c a dt k 1 c a 5 d c b dt k 1 c a k 2 c c k 4 c b 6 d c c dt k 2 c c in this simplified model e2α and e2β first degrade into e1 and e1 then degrades into other compounds the degradation rates of e2β and e1 in the redwood river were derived from the data reported by writer et al 2011 and the degradation rate of e2α was estimated from the data measured in taunton river water massachusetts robinson et al 2017 the lumped first order degradation rates of e2α e2β and e1 were estimated to be 0 62 3 2 and 0 85 day 1 respectively the estrogen released onto the land surface from non points sources can be flushed into surface water during storm events the mass of estrogens transported from land to surface water was quantified by a modified wash off model below zhao lung 2018 7 m s 1 exp k w q where m is the total mass of estrogens flushed from the land surface by surface runoff during storm events s is the total mass of estrogen on land kw is the wash off coefficient and q is the area normalized surface runoff in a unit of in hr the data reported by yang et al 2012 was used to derive the value of the wash off coefficient the kw values for e1 e2α and e2β were estimated to be 26 8 4 52 and 15 8 hr in respectively 2 4 hspf model for estrogens the hspf model is a lumped watershed model that has three major modules the perlnd the implnd and the rchres us epa 2015 the perlnd module simulates runoff and pollutant loadings from pervious land segments the implnd module simulates runoff and pollutants from impervious land segments and the rchres module simulates hydraulic behavior and generalized pollutants in reaches including point source contributions us epa 2015 a utility module in hspf the gqual can be used to simulate the fate and transport of user defined pollutants in surface water released from both non point sources and point sources the hspf model assumes that the pollutants from non point sources accumulate on the land surface during dry days and are flushed into surface water during wet days the pollutant accumulation rate on the land surface is defined by the on land attenuation rate the mass of pollutants that can be transported into reaches is determined by both the accumulation rate and the wash off coefficient in an hspf model the flow rates and pollutant concentrations are calculated at the reach outlet in each subwatershed and the pollutant concentrations are simulated based on the travel time of flow through each subwatershed degradation rates and the flow rates the hspf model internally calculates the travel time of flow in reaches from the flow volume and the reach length in each subwatershed in this study the hspf model was employed to simulate the estrogen concentrations in the redwood river watershed at three estrogen sampling sites set by lee et al 2014 which were also the reach outlets in subwatersheds 5 6 and 7 the modeled eeqs were then derived from the modeled e1 e2α and e2β concentrations one unit of e1 e2α and e2β equals 0 2 0 125 and 1 unit of estradiol equivalency respectively lee et al 2014 to cover the measured estrogen data in 2007 and to avoid the missing flow data or the meteorological data period the estrogen modeling in the redwood river watershed was conducted from march 2006 to february 2009 the modeled flow rates at the reach outlet of subwatershed 5 were compared to the measured values at the usgs gage 05 315 000 for the hydrological calibration and the modeled eeqs were compared to the values that were measured by lee et al 2014 at the three sampling sites in 2007 to assess the model performance the hydrological calibration was conducted from march 2006 to february 2008 by adjusting the hydrological parameters within the possible range allowed by hspf until an acceptable agreement between the measured and modeled flow rates was obtained the key parameters included the upper zone nominal soil moisture storage uzsn the lower zone nominal soil moisture storage lzsn the index to infiltration capacity infilt the interflow inflow parameter intfw the variable groundwater recession kvary the interflow inflow parameter intfw and the lower zone evapotranspiration parameter lzetp us epa 2015 the calibrated model was then used to simulate the flow rates from march 2008 to february 2009 for the hydrological validation after the hydrological calibration was accomplished a hydrological sensitivity analysis was conducted by increasing or decreasing each hydrological parameter by 20 the change in the total flow high flow low flow summer flow winter flow and storm flow from march 2006 to february 2009 were then assessed the estrogen modeling was conducted following the hydrological calibration the required inputs include the estrogen loading rates from non point and points sources the estrogen wash off coefficients and their degradation rates in water the wash off coefficient and the degradation rates of estrogens in water are discussed in section 2 3 the estrogen loading rates from sources were derived from the values listed in table 1 assumptions and steps are described in detail in section 4 in si the following hypothetical scenarios were then developed to quantify the estrogens contributed from each source to the redwood river by dividing the accumulated estrogen concentrations from each hypothetical scenario by those from the base scenario 1 estrogen loads only from manure used for land application and grazing cattle on pasture land were added to the model 2 estrogen loads only from grazing cattle in streams were added to the model 3 estrogen loads only from wwtps were added to the model 4 estrogen loads only from failed septic systems were added to the model the accuracy of this complex model is impacted by several factors including the flow rate the degradation and conversion rates the livestock density the wwtp effluent concentration and the wash off coefficient a sensitivity analysis was thus conducted to quantify the uncertainty caused by those factors in the sensitivity analysis each of the hydrological and estrogen parameters was decreased or increased by 20 and the changes in the annual mean of the simulated total estrogen levels were assessed the hydrological parameters include precipitation lzsn infilt kvary agwrc uzsn intfw and lzetp the estrogen parameters include the degradation rates of e2α and e2β into e1 the degradation rate of e1 into other compounds the livestock density the wwtp effluent concentrations manure application rates and the grazing time in addition to investigate the range of modeled estrogens in the redwood river watershed a worst best case analysis was conducted by running the following scenarios 1 the highest estimated estrogen loads and the lowest in water degradation rates were added to the model 2 the lowest estimated estrogen loads and the highest in water degradation rates were added to the model the first scenario helped to determine the upper limit of estrogen levels in redwood river while the second scenario helped to determine the lower limit the modeling results of the two scenarios depict the possible range of the hspf model values resulting from the uncertainty of input data the lower and upper limits of the variables used to quantify estrogen inputs are listed in table 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrological calibration and validation the observed and the modeled daily flow rates at the usgs gage 05 315 000 from march 2006 to february 2009 are illustrated in fig 2 the accumulated modeled flow in all flow regimes and seasons high flow low flow seasonal flow and storm flows were calculated and compared to the observed values the comparison results are summarized in table 4 in table 4 the low flow represents the 50th percentile low flow and the high flow represents the 90th percentile high flow during the study period the major hydrological parameter values used in this model are provided in table s3 in si even though the usgs reported long periods of estimated flow rates instead of the measured values and thus induced uncertainties in evaluating the hydrological modeling performance the modeling results in general fit the observed flows well the nldas data covers the whole study area and thus enables the hspc model to capture the spatial variations of precipitation and increase the simulation accuracy the hydrological sensitivity analytical results are summarized in table s4 in si the analysis results show that kvary agwrc lzetp intfw lzsn infilt and uzsn can effectively affect the total flow high flow baseflow and seasonal flow in this case study kavry lzetp and agwrc have the largest impact on the modeling result kvary and agwrc mainly impact high flows while lzetp mainly impacts the base flow additionally the hydrological sensitivity analysis shows that kvary and agwrc have a large impact on winter flows while lzetp has a large impact on summer flows 3 2 modeled estrogen levels in redwood river watershed the modeled total concentrations of the three estrogens at the three sampling sites range from 0 0024 ng l to 5 09 ng l in 2007 as depicted in fig 3 a 3b and 3c the modeled estrogen levels from each source are shown in fig 3d 3e and 3f and figs s1 s3 in si the simulated eeqs range from 0 00070 to 2 32 ng l at point 1 the outlet of subwatershed 5 from 0 00096 to 1 27 ng l at point 2 the outlet of subwatershed 6 and from 0 00095 to 2 18 ng l at point 3 the outlet of subwatershed 7 they are shown as a red line in fig 3 those modeled values are comparable to the measured average eeqs values which are 0 032 ng l 0 082 ng l and 0 056 ng l at points 1 2 and 3 respectively the modeled and measured eeqs are shown in fig 3d 3e and 3f the simulated estrogens at the three points have a similar pattern with high concentrations appearing both on storm days after cattle started grazing and or the manure land application and the dry days this is due to the fact that 1 on wet days a relatively large mass of estrogens accumulated on the land surface is flushed into surface water 2 on dry days the low in stream flows on dry days cannot dilute estrogens poured from point sources jumps in estrogen concentrations on march 12th and march 21st in 2007 are correlated with the increased flow rates which are caused by the snow melting rather than the storm events snow melting in spring can lead to increased surface runoffs and transport estrogens into the surface water large surface runoff events after manure land application and or cattle grazing can cause a sharp increase in in stream estrogen levels causing drastic change in the surface water environment and impairing the health of the aquatic animals this indicates that estrogen management practices can be taken after heavy rains or in snow melt seasons for a good effect the modeled estrogen concentrations at point 1 on dry days are higher than those at point 2 resulting from larger contributions from wwtps in subwatershed 5 lynd wwtp located in subwatershed 5 has high estrogen concentrations and low effluent rates during dry days the simulated flow rates in subwatershed 5 are low and thus cannot dilute the estrogens poured from wwtps conversely marshall wwtp which is in sunbwatershed 6 has lower estrogen concentrations and much higher effluent rates the estrogens in subwatershed 6 are thus more diluted also the larger agricultural land area in subwatershed 5 leads to higher peaks at point 1 in march the total agricultural land area in subwatershed 5 is 44 km2 accounting for 67 of the total area conversely the agricultural land area in subwatershed 6 is only 9 km2 and 50 of the land is urbanized this model work assumed that the cattle started grazing on pastureland in march and the manure land application did not start until april table s6 in si the lack of pastureland in subwatershed 7 results in lower peaks at point 3 in march among the identified sources manure contributes 86 45 and 57 of modeled estrogens in subwatersheds 5 6 and 7 respectively thus bmps such as buffer stripes are necessary to reduce the estrogen loadings from agricultural land shore 2009 the second largest source is wwtps and marshall wwtp accounts for 24 to 33 of the total modeled estrogens in the redwood river in subwatersheds 6 and 7 failing septic systems and grazing cattle defecation to streams are not the major estrogen sources compared to wwtps and manure based on the modeling results 3 3 sensitivity and uncertainty analysis for estrogen fig 4 shows the results of the sensitivity analysis at the three points the percentage change in the annual mean eeqs was depicted against the decrease or increase of hydrological parameters and the estrogen parameters by 20 the modeled estrogen levels are sensitive to agwrc and precipitation this shows that modeling results are strongly affected by the flow rates thus a good hydrological calibration is critical to the accurate modeling results for estrogens the simulation results are also sensitive to the manure application rates decay rates of estrogens in rivers and the cattle grazing time implying that the assumption on estrogen decay rates in rivers manure application time and rates and the cattle grazing schedule can largely impact the modeling results the results of the sensitivity analysis in turn indicate that cattle manure released on the land surface via the land application grazing cattle and wwtps are two major factors for estrogen bmps buffer stripes have been observed to effectively reduce estrogen loads by surface runoff from manure land application and are thus recommended shore 2009 in addition manure storage and manure composting can effectively reduce estrogen content and are thus encouraged bartelt hunt et al 2013 fig 4e and 4f also show that the wwtps with large discharges can greatly impact the river downstream the measured e1 in discharge from lynd wwtp with only a stabilization pond was up to 18 ng l while the measured e1 in discharge from marshall wwtp with tertiary treatments was only 3 04 ng l table s10 in si indicating that upgrading wwtps with tertiary treatments can effectively reduce estrogens in effluents this study assumed that wwtps release estrogens at a constant rate and did not account for the day to day variations this study also used the average estrogen excretion rates from humans and livestock however gender age and fertility status can impact estrogen excretion rates those uncertainties can cause the failure to capture measured peaks shown in fig 3 the worst best scenario analysis helped to investigate the uncertainty caused by those assumptions in fig 5 the grey shadow illustrates the upper and lower bounds of the modeled eeqs that can be captured by this modeling work the range between the highest and lowest modeled eeqs was determined by the variations in wwtps effluent rates septic system failing rates estrogen attenuation rates in water the human and livestock population and the estrogen excretion range caused by gender age and fertility status the modeled eeqs in subwatersheds 5 6 and 7 vary from 0 to 16 88 ng l covering most of the measured values the predicted no effect concentration pnec of e2β is reported to be 2 ng l caldwell et al 2012 as the simulated eeqs can be above the pnec during the modeling period the adverse effects of estrogens on the aquatic animals cannot be ignored for this watershed given the limited measured data the modeling results were also compared to the eeqs detected across the world the reported eeqs range from below the detection limit to 35 ng l globally and are comparable to the modeling results peck et al 2004 anderson et al 2012 scott et al 2014 gorga et al 2015 barber et al 2019 3 4 limitations and future directions the modeling framework was developed based on estrogens information revealed by recent studies however many gaps remain in our understanding of estrogen fate and transport on a watershed scale and further studies are needed first most studies focusing on the attenuation of estrogens are conducted under ideal experimental conditions and very few of them investigate the attenuation rates in the natural environment second at present most of the studies investigating the transport of estrogens from agricultural land quantitatively conclude that the transport process is affected by precipitation but they fail to quantify the transport of estrogens by additional processes such as irrigation leaching preferential flow pronounced macropore flow and discharge from the soil shore et al 2004 sangsupan et al 2006 kjær et al 2007 durán álvarez et al 2014 jones et al 2014 third animals can excrete different amounts of estrogens at different estrous states or with different diets which is often not accounted for when estimating the yearly production of estrogens from livestock tucker 2009 zhang et al 2014 additionally the major focus has been on measuring the fecal excretion of estrogens but there are other less studied pathways for estrogen excretion such as emesis cantarow et al 1943 furthermore in addition to farm animals wild animals can also contribute estrogens to surface water rolland et al 2005 pereira et al 2006 to address the issues listed above and further improve the modeling framework developed in this study further studies are needed to quantify the estrogen excretion more accurately by both farm animals and wildlife studies to investigate additional pathways to transport estrogens from land to rivers in addition to surface runoff are also needed additionally the attenuation and transformation rates measured in the natural environment are essential to accurately estimate estrogen levels in the natural water bodies 4 summary and conclusions this study developed a modeling framework with the hspf to simultaneously simulate the levels of three dominant estrogens e1 e2β and e2α in surface water integrating their excretion transport interconversion and attenuation processes on a watershed scale the modeling frame was applied to the redwood river watershed the modeled eeqs derived from e1 e2β and e2α concentrations are comparable to the measured values at three sites along the redwood river in 2007 the modeling results showed that the modeled estrogens are highly affected by hydrological conditions the storm events or snow melting after the manure land application and or cattle grazing have the potential to drastically increase the estrogens levels in the surface water at the same time point sources such as wwtps can lead to elevated estrogens levels during the dry period in this case study the modeled estrogens are most sensitive to manure land application rates discharge from wwtps and cattle grazing time those results indicate that the reduction of the loads from wwtps on dry days and the reduction of the loads from manure on rainy days are two practical mechanisms to control estrogens buffer stripes and manure storage composting are thus encouraged bartelt hunt et al 2013 the case study showed that the modeling framework developed using hspf can be applied to a watershed scale to assess the temporal and spatial variations of multiple estrogens levels along rivers this modeling framework can help to quantify estrogen contributions from various estrogen sources identify the factors that lead to high estrogen levels in rivers assess potential risks of estrogens on a watershed scale and determine bmps such quantification can be further used to develop the total maximum daily loads tmdl of estrogens for a watershed in addition to estrogens the modeling framework can be applied to compounds that have similar fate and transport characteristics and processes such as androgens credit authorship contribution statement xiaomin zhao conceptualization methodology

3244,the risks associated with estrogens in detectable concentrations in the aquatic environment underscore the need to best manage the release of estrogenic compounds modeling work can effectively help to understand the variation of estrogens in the natural water bodies at low costs this study developed a modeling framework based on the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf code to simulate the fate and transport of three dominant estrogens estrone e1 17β estradiol e2β and 17α estradiol e2α in surface water by integrating their excretion transport interconversion and attenuation processes this work focused on estrogens from sewage systems failing septic systems grazing animals and manure land application the developed modeling framework was applied to the redwood river watershed in minnesota to model the in stream estradiol equivalents eeqs the modeled eeqs were comparable to the values measured at three sampling sites along the redwood river in 2007 the modeling results indicate that wastewater treatment plant discharges elevate estrogen levels on dry days and surface runoff caused by storms or snow melting after the manure land application and or cattle grazing can drastically spike eeqs levels suggesting the application of buffer stripes and manure storage composting for estrogen control the case study shows that the modeling framework can be used

sexual development of aquatic animals such as zebrafish and trout in detectable concentrations in the aquatic environment larsson et al 1999 brion et al 2004 concentrated animal feeding operations cafos wastewater treatment plants wwtps and failing septic systems release estrogens into receiving water and cause the levels of estrogens to rise downstream through effluents and sediments lange et al 2002 schoenecker et al 2004 minnesota pollution control agency 2011 additionally e2β is identified as a degradation product of e2α lee liu 2002 robinson et al 2017 to minimize the potential risks caused by estrogens to aquatic animals it is quite important to assess variation patterns of estrogens in the surface water and determine the best management practices bmps for them even though several studies have been conducted to explore the distribution patterns of estrogens they all have some limitations on site measurement studies usually cannot obtain sufficient data to draw a whole picture for estrogen distribution characteristics conley et al 2017 also most estrogen samplings are conducted in the influents and effluents of wwtps and the surface runoff from the agricultural land which are not the typical living environments of aquatic animals atkinson et al 2012 gall et al 2014 gall et al 2015 conversely measurements of estrogens in aquatic systems such as rivers and streams are sporadic making it difficult to quantify the spatial and temporal variations of estrogens soto et al 2004 bradley et al 2009 furthermore the estrogen levels in surface waters are usually quite low or even below the detection limits and are thus hard to be accurately measured bradley et al 2009 dynamic models are good solutions as simulating estrogens can help to understand the variation of estrogens in the natural water bodies at low costs several studies have been conducted to develop such models on large scales grill et al 2018 predicted in stream concentrations of e1 e2β and e3 at the scale of the entire mainland china using a vector based river routing model hydrorout johnson 2010 simulated e1 e2β and ee2 levels in two rivers in the uk based on the mass balance johnson et al 2013 predicted ee2 and e2β concentrations in european rivers using a geographic based water model gwava however those studies considered sewage systems the major estrogen sources and ignored contributions from agricultural activities in another study zhao lung 2017 modeled estrogen levels in the south river in the u s this study considered cafos as an additional major estrogen source but it only focused on e2β and did not work on multiple estrogens addressing the above issues a modeling framework is thus needed to quantify the spatial and temporal estrogen distributions by integrating their excretion transport interconversion and attenuation processes in the system the hydrological simulation program fortran hspf a mathematical model for simulation of watershed hydrology and water quality on a basin scale in one dimensional stream channels is capable to conduct such analysis us epa 2015 the model tracks the fate and transport of water pollutants from point and non point sources in pervious and impervious areas us epa 2015 and it has been widely applied to assess multiple water pollutants including e2β fecal bacteria nutrients pesticides and metals on watershed basin scales ouyang et al 2012 rolle et al 2012 zhao and lung 2018 meshesha et al 2020 risal et al 2021 thus the goal of this study is to develop a modeling framework based on hspf to simulate the levels of three dominant estrogens e1 e2β and e2α and estradiol equivalents eeqs in rivers on a watershed scale integrating their excretion transport interconversion and attenuation processes this framework is aimed at tracking the fate and transport of estrogens from various sources such as human activities agricultural activities and other possible sources this framework can be used to characterize the temporal and spatial variation of estrogens in streams evaluate their risk to aquatic animals and determine the best management practices for estrogen control 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and extent of available data the study site as illustrated in fig 1 is in southwestern minnesota us the redwood river is the main river system in this area this watershed has a total area of 768 km2 and agricultural land accounts for 72 3 of the total area according to the national land cover database nlcd 2011 the land use and area information are summarized in table s1 in supporting information si the hydrography and elevation information was obtained from the united states geological survey usgs tyler wwtp lynd wwtp marshall wwtp russell wwtp and ruthton wwtp are located within the selected watershed and discharge into the redwood river the daily flow rates of the redwood river were measured at a usgs gage 05 315 000 shown as a green triangle in fig 1 and the in stream eeqs were measured at three locations shown as three purple dots in fig 1 along the redwood river in 2007 by lee et al 2014 this redwood watershed was delineated into seven subwatersheds based on the hydrography information elevations and the four points of interest the site of the usgs gage 05 315 000 and the three estrogen sampling sites as a result of the delineation the reach outlet of subwatershed 5 was located at the usgs site and the first estrogen sampling site and the outlets of subwatersheds 6 and 7 were set to be at the other two estrogen sampling sites the livestock populations in each subwatershed were obtained from the minnesota geospatial commons and are summarized in table s5 in si beef cattle dairy cattle and swine are the dominant livestock in this watershed hourly precipitation and air temperature in each subwatershed were obtained from the north american land data assimilation system nldas additional meteorological data including wind speed dew point temperature and cloud cover measured at pipestone municipal airport and southwest minnesota regional airport were obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa other meteorological data including hourly solar radiation evaporation and evapotranspiration were calculated and disaggregated by the wdmutil which is a utility program to manage and store input and output time series data for the hspf cloud cover was originally reported as clear scattered broken or overcast and was converted to a scale ranging from 1 to 10 using the strategy listed in table s2 in si the pipestone municipal airport data was applied to subwatersheds 1 3 and the southwest minnesota regional airport data was applied to subwatersheds 4 7 based on a thiessen polygon analysis 2 2 contributions of estrogens in the redwood river watershed cattle swine septic systems and the five wwtps were identified as primary sources of estrogens in the redwood river watershed according to the u s epa biosolids are applied to less than 1 of the nation s agricultural land it was thus not considered as a major estrogen source in this study in this case study the sources that release estrogens on the land surface were non point sources and the sources that release estrogen directly into surface water were point sources the estrogens released by non point sources can get into surface water from the land surface during storm events in the redwood river watershed cattle and swine manure that is used for land application was a non point source additionally grazing cattle can defecate on pastureland during grazing and release estrogens on the land surface and was thus another non point source conversely failing septic systems and wwtps drainage estrogens directly into the water matrix and were thus analyzed as point sources in this study likewise grazing cattle that directly defecate into streams were also a point source the estrogen mass released from livestock manure was estimated from the livestock population the manure production per animal and the estrogen content in manure the livestock populations were assumed to remain constant throughout the study period for this estimation the estrogens contributed by failing septic systems were quantified from the population that is connected to septic systems the estrogen excretion amount per capita and the failing rate of septic systems the estrogen contributions from the sewage systems can be derived from the estrogens discharged into the sewage systems and the estrogen removal efficiency johnson 2010 according to the data availability the estrogen released from wwtp effluents was estimated from the effluent rates and the measured estrogen concentrations in wwtp effluents zhao lung 2017 the information on each source that was used to quantify the estrogen contributions are listed in table 1 the detailed assumptions and methods for estimating estrogen loads are depicted in section 4 in si 2 3 attenuation transformation and transport of estrogens in the environment in the natural environment estrogens undergo complicated transformation and interconversion processes e1 is usually an intermediate of e2α and e2β attenuation colucci topp 2002 steiner et al 2010 meanwhile e2α and e2β are intermediates of e1 writer et al 2011 zheng et al 2012 the estrogens released from non point sources go through attenuation and degradation before entering the surface water this study assumed that the manure was stored in an anaerobic lagoon for 180 days before the land application edmonds et al 2003 after the land application estrogens within manure go through further degradation and conversion processes on the land surface until they are flushed into streams and rivers by surface runoff those processes during storage in anaerobic lagoons and on the land surface during dry periods were estimated by the model depicted below zhao lung 2021 1 d c a dt k 1 k 3 c a k 1 c b 2 d c b dt k 1 c a k 1 k 2 k 4 c b k 2 c c 3 d c c dt k 3 c a k 2 c b k 2 c c where ca cb and cc are the concentrations or the masses of e2α e1 and e2β respectively t is time k1 is the transformation rate constant of e2α to e1 k 1 is the transformation rate constant of e1 to e2α k2 is the transformation rate constant of e2β to e1 k 2 is the transformation rate constant of e1 to e2β k3 is the transformation rate constant of e2a to e2β and k4 is the transformation rate of e1 to other compounds the transformation and attenuation rates of estrogens during storage were estimated by fitting the eqs 1 to 3 to the measured data in anaerobic lagoons that was obtained from a previous study zheng et al 2012 the dominant soil within the redwood river watershed is a silt clay loam according to web soil survey wss the transformation and attenuation rates of estrogens land surface were thus estimated by fitting the eqs 1 to 3 to the measured data in the silt clay loam soil reported previously mashtare et al 2013 the estimated transformation and degradation rates are summarized in table 2 the degradation and conversions processes are rapid in rivers and it is difficult to measure the transformation and interconversion rate constants used in eqs 1 to 3 campbell et al 2006 zhao lung et al 2019 the estrogen degradation in the surface water was thus simplified as an irreversible process below zheng et al 2012 4 d c a dt k 1 c a 5 d c b dt k 1 c a k 2 c c k 4 c b 6 d c c dt k 2 c c in this simplified model e2α and e2β first degrade into e1 and e1 then degrades into other compounds the degradation rates of e2β and e1 in the redwood river were derived from the data reported by writer et al 2011 and the degradation rate of e2α was estimated from the data measured in taunton river water massachusetts robinson et al 2017 the lumped first order degradation rates of e2α e2β and e1 were estimated to be 0 62 3 2 and 0 85 day 1 respectively the estrogen released onto the land surface from non points sources can be flushed into surface water during storm events the mass of estrogens transported from land to surface water was quantified by a modified wash off model below zhao lung 2018 7 m s 1 exp k w q where m is the total mass of estrogens flushed from the land surface by surface runoff during storm events s is the total mass of estrogen on land kw is the wash off coefficient and q is the area normalized surface runoff in a unit of in hr the data reported by yang et al 2012 was used to derive the value of the wash off coefficient the kw values for e1 e2α and e2β were estimated to be 26 8 4 52 and 15 8 hr in respectively 2 4 hspf model for estrogens the hspf model is a lumped watershed model that has three major modules the perlnd the implnd and the rchres us epa 2015 the perlnd module simulates runoff and pollutant loadings from pervious land segments the implnd module simulates runoff and pollutants from impervious land segments and the rchres module simulates hydraulic behavior and generalized pollutants in reaches including point source contributions us epa 2015 a utility module in hspf the gqual can be used to simulate the fate and transport of user defined pollutants in surface water released from both non point sources and point sources the hspf model assumes that the pollutants from non point sources accumulate on the land surface during dry days and are flushed into surface water during wet days the pollutant accumulation rate on the land surface is defined by the on land attenuation rate the mass of pollutants that can be transported into reaches is determined by both the accumulation rate and the wash off coefficient in an hspf model the flow rates and pollutant concentrations are calculated at the reach outlet in each subwatershed and the pollutant concentrations are simulated based on the travel time of flow through each subwatershed degradation rates and the flow rates the hspf model internally calculates the travel time of flow in reaches from the flow volume and the reach length in each subwatershed in this study the hspf model was employed to simulate the estrogen concentrations in the redwood river watershed at three estrogen sampling sites set by lee et al 2014 which were also the reach outlets in subwatersheds 5 6 and 7 the modeled eeqs were then derived from the modeled e1 e2α and e2β concentrations one unit of e1 e2α and e2β equals 0 2 0 125 and 1 unit of estradiol equivalency respectively lee et al 2014 to cover the measured estrogen data in 2007 and to avoid the missing flow data or the meteorological data period the estrogen modeling in the redwood river watershed was conducted from march 2006 to february 2009 the modeled flow rates at the reach outlet of subwatershed 5 were compared to the measured values at the usgs gage 05 315 000 for the hydrological calibration and the modeled eeqs were compared to the values that were measured by lee et al 2014 at the three sampling sites in 2007 to assess the model performance the hydrological calibration was conducted from march 2006 to february 2008 by adjusting the hydrological parameters within the possible range allowed by hspf until an acceptable agreement between the measured and modeled flow rates was obtained the key parameters included the upper zone nominal soil moisture storage uzsn the lower zone nominal soil moisture storage lzsn the index to infiltration capacity infilt the interflow inflow parameter intfw the variable groundwater recession kvary the interflow inflow parameter intfw and the lower zone evapotranspiration parameter lzetp us epa 2015 the calibrated model was then used to simulate the flow rates from march 2008 to february 2009 for the hydrological validation after the hydrological calibration was accomplished a hydrological sensitivity analysis was conducted by increasing or decreasing each hydrological parameter by 20 the change in the total flow high flow low flow summer flow winter flow and storm flow from march 2006 to february 2009 were then assessed the estrogen modeling was conducted following the hydrological calibration the required inputs include the estrogen loading rates from non point and points sources the estrogen wash off coefficients and their degradation rates in water the wash off coefficient and the degradation rates of estrogens in water are discussed in section 2 3 the estrogen loading rates from sources were derived from the values listed in table 1 assumptions and steps are described in detail in section 4 in si the following hypothetical scenarios were then developed to quantify the estrogens contributed from each source to the redwood river by dividing the accumulated estrogen concentrations from each hypothetical scenario by those from the base scenario 1 estrogen loads only from manure used for land application and grazing cattle on pasture land were added to the model 2 estrogen loads only from grazing cattle in streams were added to the model 3 estrogen loads only from wwtps were added to the model 4 estrogen loads only from failed septic systems were added to the model the accuracy of this complex model is impacted by several factors including the flow rate the degradation and conversion rates the livestock density the wwtp effluent concentration and the wash off coefficient a sensitivity analysis was thus conducted to quantify the uncertainty caused by those factors in the sensitivity analysis each of the hydrological and estrogen parameters was decreased or increased by 20 and the changes in the annual mean of the simulated total estrogen levels were assessed the hydrological parameters include precipitation lzsn infilt kvary agwrc uzsn intfw and lzetp the estrogen parameters include the degradation rates of e2α and e2β into e1 the degradation rate of e1 into other compounds the livestock density the wwtp effluent concentrations manure application rates and the grazing time in addition to investigate the range of modeled estrogens in the redwood river watershed a worst best case analysis was conducted by running the following scenarios 1 the highest estimated estrogen loads and the lowest in water degradation rates were added to the model 2 the lowest estimated estrogen loads and the highest in water degradation rates were added to the model the first scenario helped to determine the upper limit of estrogen levels in redwood river while the second scenario helped to determine the lower limit the modeling results of the two scenarios depict the possible range of the hspf model values resulting from the uncertainty of input data the lower and upper limits of the variables used to quantify estrogen inputs are listed in table 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrological calibration and validation the observed and the modeled daily flow rates at the usgs gage 05 315 000 from march 2006 to february 2009 are illustrated in fig 2 the accumulated modeled flow in all flow regimes and seasons high flow low flow seasonal flow and storm flows were calculated and compared to the observed values the comparison results are summarized in table 4 in table 4 the low flow represents the 50th percentile low flow and the high flow represents the 90th percentile high flow during the study period the major hydrological parameter values used in this model are provided in table s3 in si even though the usgs reported long periods of estimated flow rates instead of the measured values and thus induced uncertainties in evaluating the hydrological modeling performance the modeling results in general fit the observed flows well the nldas data covers the whole study area and thus enables the hspc model to capture the spatial variations of precipitation and increase the simulation accuracy the hydrological sensitivity analytical results are summarized in table s4 in si the analysis results show that kvary agwrc lzetp intfw lzsn infilt and uzsn can effectively affect the total flow high flow baseflow and seasonal flow in this case study kavry lzetp and agwrc have the largest impact on the modeling result kvary and agwrc mainly impact high flows while lzetp mainly impacts the base flow additionally the hydrological sensitivity analysis shows that kvary and agwrc have a large impact on winter flows while lzetp has a large impact on summer flows 3 2 modeled estrogen levels in redwood river watershed the modeled total concentrations of the three estrogens at the three sampling sites range from 0 0024 ng l to 5 09 ng l in 2007 as depicted in fig 3 a 3b and 3c the modeled estrogen levels from each source are shown in fig 3d 3e and 3f and figs s1 s3 in si the simulated eeqs range from 0 00070 to 2 32 ng l at point 1 the outlet of subwatershed 5 from 0 00096 to 1 27 ng l at point 2 the outlet of subwatershed 6 and from 0 00095 to 2 18 ng l at point 3 the outlet of subwatershed 7 they are shown as a red line in fig 3 those modeled values are comparable to the measured average eeqs values which are 0 032 ng l 0 082 ng l and 0 056 ng l at points 1 2 and 3 respectively the modeled and measured eeqs are shown in fig 3d 3e and 3f the simulated estrogens at the three points have a similar pattern with high concentrations appearing both on storm days after cattle started grazing and or the manure land application and the dry days this is due to the fact that 1 on wet days a relatively large mass of estrogens accumulated on the land surface is flushed into surface water 2 on dry days the low in stream flows on dry days cannot dilute estrogens poured from point sources jumps in estrogen concentrations on march 12th and march 21st in 2007 are correlated with the increased flow rates which are caused by the snow melting rather than the storm events snow melting in spring can lead to increased surface runoffs and transport estrogens into the surface water large surface runoff events after manure land application and or cattle grazing can cause a sharp increase in in stream estrogen levels causing drastic change in the surface water environment and impairing the health of the aquatic animals this indicates that estrogen management practices can be taken after heavy rains or in snow melt seasons for a good effect the modeled estrogen concentrations at point 1 on dry days are higher than those at point 2 resulting from larger contributions from wwtps in subwatershed 5 lynd wwtp located in subwatershed 5 has high estrogen concentrations and low effluent rates during dry days the simulated flow rates in subwatershed 5 are low and thus cannot dilute the estrogens poured from wwtps conversely marshall wwtp which is in sunbwatershed 6 has lower estrogen concentrations and much higher effluent rates the estrogens in subwatershed 6 are thus more diluted also the larger agricultural land area in subwatershed 5 leads to higher peaks at point 1 in march the total agricultural land area in subwatershed 5 is 44 km2 accounting for 67 of the total area conversely the agricultural land area in subwatershed 6 is only 9 km2 and 50 of the land is urbanized this model work assumed that the cattle started grazing on pastureland in march and the manure land application did not start until april table s6 in si the lack of pastureland in subwatershed 7 results in lower peaks at point 3 in march among the identified sources manure contributes 86 45 and 57 of modeled estrogens in subwatersheds 5 6 and 7 respectively thus bmps such as buffer stripes are necessary to reduce the estrogen loadings from agricultural land shore 2009 the second largest source is wwtps and marshall wwtp accounts for 24 to 33 of the total modeled estrogens in the redwood river in subwatersheds 6 and 7 failing septic systems and grazing cattle defecation to streams are not the major estrogen sources compared to wwtps and manure based on the modeling results 3 3 sensitivity and uncertainty analysis for estrogen fig 4 shows the results of the sensitivity analysis at the three points the percentage change in the annual mean eeqs was depicted against the decrease or increase of hydrological parameters and the estrogen parameters by 20 the modeled estrogen levels are sensitive to agwrc and precipitation this shows that modeling results are strongly affected by the flow rates thus a good hydrological calibration is critical to the accurate modeling results for estrogens the simulation results are also sensitive to the manure application rates decay rates of estrogens in rivers and the cattle grazing time implying that the assumption on estrogen decay rates in rivers manure application time and rates and the cattle grazing schedule can largely impact the modeling results the results of the sensitivity analysis in turn indicate that cattle manure released on the land surface via the land application grazing cattle and wwtps are two major factors for estrogen bmps buffer stripes have been observed to effectively reduce estrogen loads by surface runoff from manure land application and are thus recommended shore 2009 in addition manure storage and manure composting can effectively reduce estrogen content and are thus encouraged bartelt hunt et al 2013 fig 4e and 4f also show that the wwtps with large discharges can greatly impact the river downstream the measured e1 in discharge from lynd wwtp with only a stabilization pond was up to 18 ng l while the measured e1 in discharge from marshall wwtp with tertiary treatments was only 3 04 ng l table s10 in si indicating that upgrading wwtps with tertiary treatments can effectively reduce estrogens in effluents this study assumed that wwtps release estrogens at a constant rate and did not account for the day to day variations this study also used the average estrogen excretion rates from humans and livestock however gender age and fertility status can impact estrogen excretion rates those uncertainties can cause the failure to capture measured peaks shown in fig 3 the worst best scenario analysis helped to investigate the uncertainty caused by those assumptions in fig 5 the grey shadow illustrates the upper and lower bounds of the modeled eeqs that can be captured by this modeling work the range between the highest and lowest modeled eeqs was determined by the variations in wwtps effluent rates septic system failing rates estrogen attenuation rates in water the human and livestock population and the estrogen excretion range caused by gender age and fertility status the modeled eeqs in subwatersheds 5 6 and 7 vary from 0 to 16 88 ng l covering most of the measured values the predicted no effect concentration pnec of e2β is reported to be 2 ng l caldwell et al 2012 as the simulated eeqs can be above the pnec during the modeling period the adverse effects of estrogens on the aquatic animals cannot be ignored for this watershed given the limited measured data the modeling results were also compared to the eeqs detected across the world the reported eeqs range from below the detection limit to 35 ng l globally and are comparable to the modeling results peck et al 2004 anderson et al 2012 scott et al 2014 gorga et al 2015 barber et al 2019 3 4 limitations and future directions the modeling framework was developed based on estrogens information revealed by recent studies however many gaps remain in our understanding of estrogen fate and transport on a watershed scale and further studies are needed first most studies focusing on the attenuation of estrogens are conducted under ideal experimental conditions and very few of them investigate the attenuation rates in the natural environment second at present most of the studies investigating the transport of estrogens from agricultural land quantitatively conclude that the transport process is affected by precipitation but they fail to quantify the transport of estrogens by additional processes such as irrigation leaching preferential flow pronounced macropore flow and discharge from the soil shore et al 2004 sangsupan et al 2006 kjær et al 2007 durán álvarez et al 2014 jones et al 2014 third animals can excrete different amounts of estrogens at different estrous states or with different diets which is often not accounted for when estimating the yearly production of estrogens from livestock tucker 2009 zhang et al 2014 additionally the major focus has been on measuring the fecal excretion of estrogens but there are other less studied pathways for estrogen excretion such as emesis cantarow et al 1943 furthermore in addition to farm animals wild animals can also contribute estrogens to surface water rolland et al 2005 pereira et al 2006 to address the issues listed above and further improve the modeling framework developed in this study further studies are needed to quantify the estrogen excretion more accurately by both farm animals and wildlife studies to investigate additional pathways to transport estrogens from land to rivers in addition to surface runoff are also needed additionally the attenuation and transformation rates measured in the natural environment are essential to accurately estimate estrogen levels in the natural water bodies 4 summary and conclusions this study developed a modeling framework with the hspf to simultaneously simulate the levels of three dominant estrogens e1 e2β and e2α in surface water integrating their excretion transport interconversion and attenuation processes on a watershed scale the modeling frame was applied to the redwood river watershed the modeled eeqs derived from e1 e2β and e2α concentrations are comparable to the measured values at three sites along the redwood river in 2007 the modeling results showed that the modeled estrogens are highly affected by hydrological conditions the storm events or snow melting after the manure land application and or cattle grazing have the potential to drastically increase the estrogens levels in the surface water at the same time point sources such as wwtps can lead to elevated estrogens levels during the dry period in this case study the modeled estrogens are most sensitive to manure land application rates discharge from wwtps and cattle grazing time those results indicate that the reduction of the loads from wwtps on dry days and the reduction of the loads from manure on rainy days are two practical mechanisms to control estrogens buffer stripes and manure storage composting are thus encouraged bartelt hunt et al 2013 the case study showed that the modeling framework developed using hspf can be applied to a watershed scale to assess the temporal and spatial variations of multiple estrogens levels along rivers this modeling framework can help to quantify estrogen contributions from various estrogen sources identify the factors that lead to high estrogen levels in rivers assess potential risks of estrogens on a watershed scale and determine bmps such quantification can be further used to develop the total maximum daily loads tmdl of estrogens for a watershed in addition to estrogens the modeling framework can be applied to compounds that have similar fate and transport characteristics and processes such as androgens credit authorship contribution statement xiaomin zhao conceptualization methodology
