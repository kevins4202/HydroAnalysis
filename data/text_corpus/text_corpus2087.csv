10435,soil and water conservation techniques are known to be profitable and widely promoted in sub saharan africa however how their profitability vary across cropping seasons has not been fully explored thus farmers are often faced with the dilemma of which agricultural technique s and or combination s thereof to implement in which cropping seasons and for which crops to maximize profits in this paper we investigated the profitability of two soil and water conservation techniques terraces and borders and compared them against the conventional flat cultivation in makanya catchment tanzania farmers in the area grow maize beans lablab and cowpeas over three cropping seasons locally called masika vuli and chamazi kipupwe based on field survey of 382 farmers in 2019 it was found that aggregate yields were generally higher on fields with intercrop than those with monocrop with more than 0 5 ton ha of total grain yields borders were generally more profitable 399 usd ha than terraces and flat cultivation during all three cropping seasons while flat cultivation was more lucrative during the masika than vuli season terraces was only lucrative for rainfed beans with benefit cost ratio of 1 5 208 7 usd ha and 1 2 90 5 usd ha in masika and vuli respectively beans grown on borders during chamazi season had the highest profitability with benefit cost ratio of 1 9 399 usd ha compared to terraces and flat cultivation in all three cropping seasons whereas it was more profitable to grow maize beans and lablab on borders farmers could still realize appreciable profits by growing these crops as purely rainfed on flat cultivation especially during the masika season it was concluded that in semi arid zones soil and water conservation techniques used in combination with other auxiliary practices such as irrigation intercropping with legumes mulching and manure application could greatly enhance profitability but that depends on cropping season and market factors

first two three years after that the techniques become profitable nevertheless how the profitability of these practices vary across different cropping seasons has not been fully explored this leaves a critical question on what swc agricultural techniques and or combination s thereof to implement in which cropping seasons and for which crops to maximize profits this study begins to remedy the gaps by analyzing seasonal profitability of two soil and water conservation techniques in makanya catchment tanzania the main swc technologies investigated in this profitability analysis are terraces and borders juxtaposed with the conventional flat cultivation by use of hand hoe we analyzed profitability using farm gross margin fgm and benefit cost ratio bcr and considered different cropping seasons masika vuli and chamazi kikupwe and the staple crops grown maize beans lablab and cowpeas from the results a decision table was thus constructed to assist farmers in deciding which techniques are more profitable to grow which crops in what cropping season s and hence maximize profits 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the research area shown in fig 1 is the semi arid makanya catchment 300 km2 located in north eastern tanzania in the south pare mountains same district kilimanjaro region the area lies at an elevation between 540 m and 2500 m above m s l in the lowlands and highlands respectively thus three agro ecological zones can be identified the highlands 1100 m midlands 800 m 1100 m and the lowlands 540 m 800 m mixed subsistence agriculture is the dominant economic activity of the inhabitants the rainfall is spread over two rainy seasons long rainy season locally called masika occurring between march may and short rainy season locally called vuli occurring between october december where farmers grow rainfed crops supplemental irrigation is used during the two rainy seasons however the dry period between masika and vuli july september is another cropping season locally called chamazi kipupwe where farmers grow short duration crops such as beans and vegetables entirely using irrigation mean annual rainfall varies from 500 to 800 mm in the lowlands and highlands respectively komakech et al 2011 2 2 sampling data collection and processing the study was carried out from february to april 2019 stratified purposive sampling was applied to select farmers with long term farming knowledge in the area farmers provided detailed information on the plots and techniques they use to grow crops the catchment was stratified into three agro climatic zones namely the highlands midlands and lowlands typically based on elevation agricultural technologies implemented rainfall and temperature administrative boundaries were used to capture details of each cluster settlement at sub village level as shown in fig 1 four administrative wards vudee chome mhezi and tae in the highlands two in the midlands bangalala and mwembe and one in the lowlands makanya were surveyed in tanzania wards are made of two or more villages which are in turn formed by two or more sub villages the three main agricultural techniques studied were terraces borders and flat cultivation fc the crops grown were maize beans lablab and cowpeas during the seasons of masika vuli and chamazi besides demographics respondents were asked about implementation of terraces borders and or fc and all associated costs of growing selected crops during masika vuli and chamazi for past normal years and corresponding output from their swc techniques and or fc plots i e plot size labor inputs land clearance cultivation planting mulching irrigation application of pesticides fertilizers and or herbicides weeding harvesting shelling winnowing purchase of seeds pesticides fertilizer and or herbicides membership fee for irrigation water use farm tools and other related data such as transport of harvest back to their homesteads this was done for all respective three cropping seasons that a respondent grows crops on his plot data collection was done using questionnaires built in open data kit odk platform in kobocollect the overall sample of the survey results was 392 smallholder farmers the sample was processed according to the following criteria a sample was removed if the techniques terraces borders and or flat cultivation were not included b if in the sample terraces borders and or flat cultivation techniques were not used to grow maize beans lablab and or cowpeas c if the sample did not capture costs of production including labor inputs manhours and or man days and d if the output in terms of crop yields per season per technique were missing using criterion a eight samples were removed and criterion b two samples were removed the rest of the samples satisfied all the four criteria thus the final number of samples used for the analysis following criteria a to d was 382 2 3 data analysis and profitability decision criteria costs incurred on farm implements for all three technologies were similar the initial capital required to establish terraces was calculated to be 706 usd ha on average which constituted mainly labor and manure costs for the case of borders the construction cost was calculated to be 107 usd ha almost seven times lower than for terraces however for this study the main interest was in variability in production costs per cropping season total variable costs versus yields per crop therefore since investment initial costs are one time off they were kept constant in situations of intercropping certain costs like weeding and irrigation were shared between maize and the respective legume labor inputs were calculated as the product of the number of man hours required for a particular task and the on farm labor wage per hour consequently to capture cost benefit variation of agricultural techniques in the various cropping seasons equations for farm gross margin and benefit cost ratio eqs 1 and 2 respectively were employed as profitability evaluation criteria 1 f a r m g r o s s m a r g i n f g m g r o s s f a r m i n c o m e g f i t o t a l v a r i a b l e c o s t s t v c gross margin allows for projection and

the technology is expected to deliver a positive net present value npv posthumus et al 2015 when bcr is 1 0 it means break even or that npv of expected profits equals the costs regarding the opportunity costs of labor for land preparation until harvest the prevailing cost of hired labor of tanzanian shillings tzs 1000 per hour was used for harvest transportation though most plots were regarded to be in the backyard for the distant fields usually motorcycles or pickup trucks with fixed costs are hired for transport by human labor it was estimated at tzs 1000 per walking distance of about 1 5 km as told by respondents prevailing prices for inputs and outputs at the time of survey were used quantities and local market prices were obtained from field interviews and crosschecked with key informants i e each kilogram of maize at tzs 600 beans at tzs 1500 lablab at tzs 1000 and cowpeas at tzs 500 for ease of international comparisons all costs were calculated and presented in usd ha and benefits first expressed in ton ha then usd ha the exchange rate of 1usd 2300 tzs at the time of the survey was applied r software tidyverse package was used for statistical calculations from eqs 1 and 2 and ms excel for data preparation and graphical display of results calculations were done per agricultural technique per crop under consideration using different prevailing combination s in a cropping season finally because profitability is very sensitive to produce prices uncertainty analysis was performed this was to determine the influence of the changes in prices of produces maize beans lablab and cowpeas on farm gross margin fgm and benefit cost ratio bcr of the considered agricultural techniques terraces borders and flat cultivation the underlying assumption was that farmers can sell their produce in a nearby town such as same or moshi in this regard data on produce prices for 2019 were collected from same and moshi towns the average prices of each kilogram of these produces in these towns were found to be tzs 1000 2000 1500 and 1000 for maize beans lablab and cowpeas respectively therefore for this analysis recalculations of fgm and bcr were done but with new data for produce prices from these towns 3 results 3 1 distribution of agricultural practices implemented analysis showed that most farmers implement more than one technique and grows more than one crop variety in the same cropping season table 1 flat cultivation fc was the most preferred technique n 316 followed by terraces n 139 and borders n 59 the average plot sizes cultivated were 0 3 ha for terraces and 0 5 ha for both borders and fc on all three techniques maize and beans were the most grown crops table 1 describes this distribution along with related activities like irrigation intercropping application of fertilizers and mulching it shows that intercropping was a common practice 59 65 and 71 on terraces borders and fc respectively while irrigation was mostly implemented on borders organic farmyard manure and compost was mostly applied in maize fields manure is applied in 95 59 and 44 on terraces borders and fc respectively however mulching was quite limited only 1 and 11 on fc and terraces respectively 3 2 costs variations farmers estimates of plot level variable costs for terraces borders and flat cultivation are as shown in table 2 overall for all the three techniques variable costs are higher on smaller plots with the extremes being on terraces the results showed that terraces are generally expensive to grow crops but less labor intensive total costs of growing maize on terraces 532 usd ha were relatively high compared with borders 328 usd ha and fc 311 usd ha however the cost of growing beans on borders 452 usd ha is higher than on terraces 435 usd ha and fc 292 usd ha the mean costs of production on terraces was 498 usd ha sd 246 whereas for borders was 364 usd ha sd 193 a welch s two samples t test showed that the difference in growing costs on terraces and borders was statistically significant p 6 72e 8 lablab and cowpeas were not grown on terraces 3 3 seasonal variation of crop yields on terraces borders and flat cultivation seasonal yields of maize beans lablab and cowpeas yields were analyzed and are presented in fig 2 the crop yields were higher on borders compared to flat cultivation and terraces in all three cropping seasons except when a farmer plants cowpeas in the case of maize fig 2a for all three techniques yields were higher during the masika above 1 5 ton ha as compared to vuli and chamazi seasons average maize yields of up to 2 ton ha was realized on borders during masika but for terraces the yields were similar across the three cropping seasons meanwhile beans yields were lower below 1 ton ha throughout all three cropping seasons on fc and terraces fig 2b but the average yields of beans grown on borders during chamazi was about 1 3 ton ha lablab which is only grown during the masika season has yields hovering at about 1 2 ton ha for fc and 1 5 ton ha for borders fig 2c cowpeas yields were low below 1 ton ha on both fc and borders as shown in fig 2 d crop yields are generally low for all three techniques during vuli season vuli season is characterized by high rainfall variability 3 4 profitability variation with cropping seasons profitability of flat cultivation borders and terraces were calculated for masika vuli and chamazi seasons table 3 presents profitability of all three techniques during the masika season and table 4 shows results for vuli and chamazi seasons as presented in table 3 except for cowpeas it was profitable to grow lablab and maize on flat cultivation and borders during masika the highest profitability was for lablab and maize grown on borders bcr 1 7 with fgm of 255 2 and 222 8 usd ha respectively the profitability of growing maize and beans on fc were comparable but it was somewhat more profitable for lablab at bcr 1 5 183 2 usd ha however growing maize and beans on terraces were not profitable during masika season in makanya rainfed beans grown as monocrop was found to be profitable profitability of growing crops during vuli season was generally low table 4 analysis shows that it was profitable to grow beans on all three techniques but as purely rainfed on fc and terraces in this season it was unprofitable to grow maize especially on terraces and flat cultivation thus farmers could grow beans instead and choose to grow their maize on borders due to no rainfall availability and access to irrigation water influences decisions during chamazi season thus farmers usually grow short duration crops such as vegetables and beans as monocrop however in the highland areas farmers still practice intercropping of maize and beans on fc in this season it was not profitable to grow maize or beans on terraces overall growing the three crops on borders were more profitable during all three cropping seasons while flat cultivation was more lucrative during the masika than vuli season terraces which was not used to grow lablab and cowpeas was also generally unprofitable to grow maize but lucrative for rainfed beans with bcr of 1 5 208 7 usd ha and 1 2 90 5 usd ha in masika and vuli respectively beans grown on borders during chamazi season showed the highest profitability with bcr 1 9 399 usd ha cowpeas had negative profitability in all three agricultural techniques and cropping seasons 3 5 farmers decision table for the selected crops and agricultural techniques table 5 summarizes profitability scenarios presented above in a decision table which can easily be adopted by the smallholder farmers in their seasonal decision making it showed that growing maize or beans was profitable on flat cultivation and borders and beans on terraces but with varying conditions for example for the case of terraces there was no need for supplemental irrigation during the masika and vuli seasons but farmers need to intercrop maize with beans during vuli a similar situation was possible on fc with the exception of lablab borders however required irrigation for all cropping seasons intercropping maize with legumes such as beans and lablab during the masika season and cowpeas during the vuli season seemed profitable break even scenarios were found for maize grown on borders and terraces during vuli season growing beans and maize on terraces in chamazi season was not profitable consequently other crops could be grown during this season however the best management practices will still require validation with larger dataset collected over a long period 3 6 uncertainty analysis for this research prices of produce represent an important component of fgm and bcr thus creating uncertainty in the profitability of swc techniques therefore profitability of terraces borders and fc were re calculated using new market prices from neighboring towns for maize beans lablab and cowpeas a significant increase in profitability was noted for example there was an exponential rise in profitability of growing maize on flat cultivation by up to bcr of 2 3 402 6usd ha from bcr of 1 4 117 3usd ha however some scenarios such as intercropping beans on borders during vuli intercropping beans during chamazi irrigated beans on flat cultivation during vuli and rainfed maize on terraces during masika remained unprofitable though with reduced margins this infers increased profitability of techniques in situations where the produce could be transported and sold in nearby towns like moshi and same 4 discussion the results have demonstrated that the implementation costs of the three investigated agricultural techniques terraces borders and flat cultivation vary per crop grown flat cultivation for example has the lowest cost of implementation it is mostly practiced in the floodplains with good soil fertility which eliminates the costs of purchase and application of fertilizer moreover the residual soil moisture stored in the floodplains helps to buffer against the impact of intra seasonal dry spell and reduces the need for frequent irrigation komakech et al 2011 hence fertilizer was mostly applied for maize crop grown on terraces 95 and borders 59 most farmers stated that on terraces the yields are much lower without fertilizers this probably is due to nutrient depletion caused by soil erosion on the steep slopes where terraces are normally constructed teshome et al 2013 also reports similar preferences in northwestern ethiopian highlands however we found limited inputs of herbicides improved seeds inorganic fertilizers and pesticides likely due to socio economic constraints of most farmers in the area supplementary irrigation using water from ephemeral rivers originating from the highlands was a common practice on borders and terraces unlike on flat cultivation also during masika and vuli seasons intercropping of maize with legumes was prevalent on all three techniques which lowered the production costs farmers can make some savings because the labor costs were shared between the two crops maintenance of swc structures were usually done during tillage 20 of general tillage costs was assumed for terraces and 10 for borders based on interview data flat cultivation however had no maintenance costs crop yields in all three techniques was low about 1 ton ha except for maize grown during masika season and this is typical for crops grown without good agronomic inputs according to bossio et al 2011 in sub saharan africa crop yields are known to keep hovering around 1 ton ha depending on the cropping season soil fertility status variety used and management practices sometimes low yields may be attained on swc techniques compared to conventional agriculture lalani et al 2016 we found this incidence when comparing grain yields of cowpeas maize beans and lablab grown on borders to those planted on flat cultivation area cowpeas yields were much lower compared to maize beans and lablab the yields can be attributed to the fact that cowpeas are also consumed as leafy vegetable which humper grain formation at the end of the season jensen et al 2003 in their study related low cowpea yields to growing of a local creeping variety at low density intercropping may offer more benefits to farmers practicing any of the swc techniques however this will require better timing of the planting dates to avoid the effect of shading masvaya et al 2017 found out that maize cowpea intercrops resulted in poor cowpea yields due to shading by the maize especially when both crops are planted at the same time although individual crop yields under intercropping in makanya were lower than monocrop aggregate grain yields were higher for intercrop than monocrop by up to 0 5 ton ha masvaya et al 2017 wang et al 2017 and pannell et al 2013 also reported similar findings nevertheless to the makanya farmers the rationale for intercropping was largely associated with limited arable land and reduction of risk in total crop failure with respect to profitability all three techniques were lucrative to grow crops during masika season probably due to reliable rainfall however low profitability was found during vuli season due to low and erratic rainfall borders are generally more profitable than terraces and flat cultivation during all three cropping seasons terraces is lucrative for purely rainfed beans with bcr of 1 5 208 7 usd ha and 1 2 90 5 usd ha when grown in masika and vuli respectively overall highest profitability with bcr 1 9 399 usd ha was found for beans grown on borders during chamazi season however it is not uncommon for farmers in semi arid areas such as the makanya catchment to implement more than one agricultural technique to grow crops the highest profitability of beans grown on borders during chamazi season as monocrop was because of irrigation after every two weeks for about two months access to irrigation presented borders with higher profitability over terraces and flat cultivation in this case previous studies such as bizoza and de graaff 2012 found terraces to be hardly profitable especially when supplementary irrigation was applied in makanya rainfed beans grown on terraces during masika and vuli seasons were found to be profitable possibly because the technique can preserve soil moisture alternatively also proposed by tenge et al 2005 higher profitability on terraces could be realized by growing higher value crops e g vegetables with relatively low investment costs bizoza and de graaff 2012 and matere et al 2016 suggested that this way terraces can be put to more intensive and productive use similarly a farmer during the survey said i have terraces but i do not grow maize or beans on it i grow vegetables instead because maize crop does not give any income unlike vegetables like okra or tomatoes ll 12 this point to the significance of choice of crop type as well as market price when implementing terraces changes in prices associated with sale of produce greatly impact on profitability as observed from results under uncertainty analysis 5 conclusion implementation of soil and water conservation swc techniques are crucial for crop production in arid and semi arid agro ecological zones of sub saharan africa this study investigated variation in profitability of growing staple crops maize beans lablab and cowpeas on two swc techniques terraces and borders when compared with the conventional flat cultivation in a normal year in the semi arid makanya catchment drawing from the above discussion masika season long rain presents relatively higher crop yields in all three techniques than vuli short rain where rainfall is low and erratic flat cultivation during the vuli season produced the lowest yields and hence not profitable to farmers growing beans instead of maize on terraces and flat cultivation during vuli is more profitable to farmers maize could be grown on borders during vuli season this study has shown that while swc techniques are known to be profitable their profitability varies with cropping seasons and crops grown moreover changes in produce prices greatly affect profitability of these techniques this study shows that knowledge of profitability of swc techniques per cropping season and crops grown is crucial to assist farmers in making decisions that will maximize their profits the decision table showing the most profitable practices per cropping season that was formulated for the three selected agricultural techniques and crops can be used to promote swc interventions the matrix can be used to explain to smallholder farmers the profitability of a selected technique in their context the decision table if used properly will allow farmers to maximize their profits from growing maize beans and lablab and optimize irrigation water use by reallocating the scarce water to higher priority crops the use of profit maximization technique may eventually lead to increased adoption of swc techniques in sub saharan african catchments declaration of competing

highlands respectively komakech et al 2011 2 2 sampling data collection and processing the study was carried out from february to april 2019 stratified purposive sampling was applied to select farmers with long term farming knowledge in the area farmers provided detailed information on the plots and techniques they use to grow crops the catchment was stratified into three agro climatic zones namely the highlands midlands and lowlands typically based on elevation agricultural technologies implemented rainfall and temperature administrative boundaries were used to capture details of each cluster settlement at sub village level as shown in fig 1 four administrative wards vudee chome mhezi and tae in the highlands two in the midlands bangalala and mwembe and one in the lowlands makanya were surveyed in tanzania wards are made of two or more villages which are in turn formed by two or more sub villages the three main agricultural techniques studied were terraces borders and flat cultivation fc the crops grown were maize beans lablab and cowpeas during the seasons of masika vuli and chamazi besides demographics respondents were asked about implementation of terraces borders and or fc and all associated costs of growing selected crops during masika vuli and chamazi for past normal years and corresponding output from their swc techniques and or fc plots i e plot size labor inputs land clearance cultivation planting mulching irrigation application of pesticides fertilizers and or herbicides weeding harvesting shelling winnowing purchase of seeds pesticides fertilizer and or herbicides membership fee for irrigation water use farm tools and other related data such as transport of harvest back to their homesteads this was done for all respective three cropping seasons that a respondent grows crops on his plot data collection was done using questionnaires built in open data kit odk platform in kobocollect the overall sample of the survey results was 392 smallholder farmers the sample was processed according to the following criteria a sample was removed if the techniques terraces borders and or flat cultivation were not included b if in the sample terraces borders and or flat cultivation techniques were not used to grow maize beans lablab and or cowpeas c if the sample did not capture costs of production including labor inputs manhours and or man days and d if the output in terms of crop yields per season per technique were missing using criterion a eight samples were removed and criterion b two samples were removed the rest of the samples satisfied all the four criteria thus the final number of samples used for the analysis following criteria a to d was 382 2 3 data analysis and profitability decision criteria costs incurred on farm implements for all three technologies were similar the initial capital required to establish terraces was calculated to be 706 usd ha on average which constituted mainly labor and manure costs for the case of borders the construction cost was calculated to be 107 usd ha almost seven times lower than for terraces however for this study the main interest was in variability in production costs per cropping season total variable costs versus yields per crop therefore since investment initial costs are one time off they were kept constant in situations of intercropping certain costs like weeding and irrigation were shared between maize and the respective legume labor inputs were calculated as the product of the number of man hours required for a particular task and the on farm labor wage per hour consequently to capture cost benefit variation of agricultural techniques in the various cropping seasons equations for farm gross margin and benefit cost ratio eqs 1 and 2 respectively were employed as profitability evaluation criteria 1 f a r m g r o s s m a r g i n f g m g r o s s f a r m i n c o m e g f i t o t a l v a r i a b l e c o s t s t v c gross margin allows for projection and

the technology is expected to deliver a positive net present value npv posthumus et al 2015 when bcr is 1 0 it means break even or that npv of expected profits equals the costs regarding the opportunity costs of labor for land preparation until harvest the prevailing cost of hired labor of tanzanian shillings tzs 1000 per hour was used for harvest transportation though most plots were regarded to be in the backyard for the distant fields usually motorcycles or pickup trucks with fixed costs are hired for transport by human labor it was estimated at tzs 1000 per walking distance of about 1 5 km as told by respondents prevailing prices for inputs and outputs at the time of survey were used quantities and local market prices were obtained from field interviews and crosschecked with key informants i e each kilogram of maize at tzs 600 beans at tzs 1500 lablab at tzs 1000 and cowpeas at tzs 500 for ease of international comparisons all costs were calculated and presented in usd ha and benefits first expressed in ton ha then usd ha the exchange rate of 1usd 2300 tzs at the time of the survey was applied r software tidyverse package was used for statistical calculations from eqs 1 and 2 and ms excel for data preparation and graphical display of results calculations were done per agricultural technique per crop under consideration using different prevailing combination s in a cropping season finally because profitability is very sensitive to produce prices uncertainty analysis was performed this was to determine the influence of the changes in prices of produces maize beans lablab and cowpeas on farm gross margin fgm and benefit cost ratio bcr of the considered agricultural techniques terraces borders and flat cultivation the underlying assumption was that farmers can sell their produce in a nearby town such as same or moshi in this regard data on produce prices for 2019 were collected from same and moshi towns the average prices of each kilogram of these produces in these towns were found to be tzs 1000 2000 1500 and 1000 for maize beans lablab and cowpeas respectively therefore for this analysis recalculations of fgm and bcr were done but with new data for produce prices from these towns 3 results 3 1 distribution of agricultural practices implemented analysis showed that most farmers implement more than one technique and grows more than one crop variety in the same cropping season table 1 flat cultivation fc was the most preferred technique n 316 followed by terraces n 139 and borders n 59 the average plot sizes cultivated were 0 3 ha for terraces and 0 5 ha for both borders and fc on all three techniques maize and beans were the most grown crops table 1 describes this distribution along with related activities like irrigation intercropping application of fertilizers and mulching it shows that intercropping was a common practice 59 65 and 71 on terraces borders and fc respectively while irrigation was mostly implemented on borders organic farmyard manure and compost was mostly applied in maize fields manure is applied in 95 59 and 44 on terraces borders and fc respectively however mulching was quite limited only 1 and 11 on fc and terraces respectively 3 2 costs variations farmers estimates of plot level variable costs for terraces borders and flat cultivation are as shown in table 2 overall for all the three techniques variable costs are higher on smaller plots with the extremes being on terraces the results showed that terraces are generally expensive to grow crops but less labor intensive total costs of growing maize on terraces 532 usd ha were relatively high compared with borders 328 usd ha and fc 311 usd ha however the cost of growing beans on borders 452 usd ha is higher than on terraces 435 usd ha and fc 292 usd ha the mean costs of production on terraces was 498 usd ha sd 246 whereas for borders was 364 usd ha sd 193 a welch s two samples t test showed that the difference in growing costs on terraces and borders was statistically significant p 6 72e 8 lablab and cowpeas were not grown on terraces 3 3 seasonal variation of crop yields on terraces borders and flat cultivation seasonal yields of maize beans lablab and cowpeas yields were analyzed and are presented in fig 2 the crop yields were higher on borders compared to flat cultivation and terraces in all three cropping seasons except when a farmer plants cowpeas in the case of maize fig 2a for all three techniques yields were higher during the masika above 1 5 ton ha as compared to vuli and chamazi seasons average maize yields of up to 2 ton ha was realized on borders during masika but for terraces the yields were similar across the three cropping seasons meanwhile beans yields were lower below 1 ton ha throughout all three cropping seasons on fc and terraces fig 2b but the average yields of beans grown on borders during chamazi was about 1 3 ton ha lablab which is only grown during the masika season has yields hovering at about 1 2 ton ha for fc and 1 5 ton ha for borders fig 2c cowpeas yields were low below 1 ton ha on both fc and borders as shown in fig 2 d crop yields are generally low for all three techniques during vuli season vuli season is characterized by high rainfall variability 3 4 profitability variation with cropping seasons profitability of flat cultivation borders and terraces were calculated for masika vuli and chamazi seasons table 3 presents profitability of all three techniques during the masika season and table 4 shows results for vuli and chamazi seasons as presented in table 3 except for cowpeas it was profitable to grow lablab and maize on flat cultivation and borders during masika the highest profitability was for lablab and maize grown on borders bcr 1 7 with fgm of 255 2 and 222 8 usd ha respectively the profitability of growing maize and beans on fc were comparable but it was somewhat more profitable for lablab at bcr 1 5 183 2 usd ha however growing maize and beans on terraces were not profitable during masika season in makanya rainfed beans grown as monocrop was found to be profitable profitability of growing crops during vuli season was generally low table 4 analysis shows that it was profitable to grow beans on all three techniques but as purely rainfed on fc and terraces in this season it was unprofitable to grow maize especially on terraces and flat cultivation thus farmers could grow beans instead and choose to grow their maize on borders due to no rainfall availability and access to irrigation water influences decisions during chamazi season thus farmers usually grow short duration crops such as vegetables and beans as monocrop however in the highland areas farmers still practice intercropping of maize and beans on fc in this season it was not profitable to grow maize or beans on terraces overall growing the three crops on borders were more profitable during all three cropping seasons while flat cultivation was more lucrative during the masika than vuli season terraces which was not used to grow lablab and cowpeas was also generally unprofitable to grow maize but lucrative for rainfed beans with bcr of 1 5 208 7 usd ha and 1 2 90 5 usd ha in masika and vuli respectively beans grown on borders during chamazi season showed the highest profitability with bcr 1 9 399 usd ha cowpeas had negative profitability in all three agricultural techniques and cropping seasons 3 5 farmers decision table for the selected crops and agricultural techniques table 5 summarizes profitability scenarios presented above in a decision table which can easily be adopted by the smallholder farmers in their seasonal decision making it showed that growing maize or beans was profitable on flat cultivation and borders and beans on terraces but with varying conditions for example for the case of terraces there was no need for supplemental irrigation during the masika and vuli seasons but farmers need to intercrop maize with beans during vuli a similar situation was possible on fc with the exception of lablab borders however required irrigation for all cropping seasons intercropping maize with legumes such as beans and lablab during the masika season and cowpeas during the vuli season seemed profitable break even scenarios were found for maize grown on borders and terraces during vuli season growing beans and maize on terraces in chamazi season was not profitable consequently other crops could be grown during this season however the best management practices will still require validation with larger dataset collected over a long period 3 6 uncertainty analysis for this research prices of produce represent an important component of fgm and bcr thus creating uncertainty in the profitability of swc techniques therefore profitability of terraces borders and fc were re calculated using new market prices from neighboring towns for maize beans lablab and cowpeas a significant increase in profitability was noted for example there was an exponential rise in profitability of growing maize on flat cultivation by up to bcr of 2 3 402 6usd ha from bcr of 1 4 117 3usd ha however some scenarios such as intercropping beans on borders during vuli intercropping beans during chamazi irrigated beans on flat cultivation during vuli and rainfed maize on terraces during masika remained unprofitable though with reduced margins this infers increased profitability of techniques in situations where the produce could be transported and sold in nearby towns like moshi and same 4 discussion the results have demonstrated that the implementation costs of the three investigated agricultural techniques terraces borders and flat cultivation vary per crop grown flat cultivation for example has the lowest cost of implementation it is mostly practiced in the floodplains with good soil fertility which eliminates the costs of purchase and application of fertilizer moreover the residual soil moisture stored in the floodplains helps to buffer against the impact of intra seasonal dry spell and reduces the need for frequent irrigation komakech et al 2011 hence fertilizer was mostly applied for maize crop grown on terraces 95 and borders 59 most farmers stated that on terraces the yields are much lower without fertilizers this probably is due to nutrient depletion caused by soil erosion on the steep slopes where terraces are normally constructed teshome et al 2013 also reports similar preferences in northwestern ethiopian highlands however we found limited inputs of herbicides improved seeds inorganic fertilizers and pesticides likely due to socio economic constraints of most farmers in the area supplementary irrigation using water from ephemeral rivers originating from the highlands was a common practice on borders and terraces unlike on flat cultivation also during masika and vuli seasons intercropping of maize with legumes was prevalent on all three techniques which lowered the production costs farmers can make some savings because the labor costs were shared between the two crops maintenance of swc structures were usually done during tillage 20 of general tillage costs was assumed for terraces and 10 for borders based on interview data flat cultivation however had no maintenance costs crop yields in all three techniques was low about 1 ton ha except for maize grown during masika season and this is typical for crops grown without good agronomic inputs according to bossio et al 2011 in sub saharan africa crop yields are known to keep hovering around 1 ton ha depending on the cropping season soil fertility status variety used and management practices sometimes low yields may be attained on swc techniques compared to conventional agriculture lalani et al 2016 we found this incidence when comparing grain yields of cowpeas maize beans and lablab grown on borders to those planted on flat cultivation area cowpeas yields were much lower compared to maize beans and lablab the yields can be attributed to the fact that cowpeas are also consumed as leafy vegetable which humper grain formation at the end of the season jensen et al 2003 in their study related low cowpea yields to growing of a local creeping variety at low density intercropping may offer more benefits to farmers practicing any of the swc techniques however this will require better timing of the planting dates to avoid the effect of shading masvaya et al 2017 found out that maize cowpea intercrops resulted in poor cowpea yields due to shading by the maize especially when both crops are planted at the same time although individual crop yields under intercropping in makanya were lower than monocrop aggregate grain yields were higher for intercrop than monocrop by up to 0 5 ton ha masvaya et al 2017 wang et al 2017 and pannell et al 2013 also reported similar findings nevertheless to the makanya farmers the rationale for intercropping was largely associated with limited arable land and reduction of risk in total crop failure with respect to profitability all three techniques were lucrative to grow crops during masika season probably due to reliable rainfall however low profitability was found during vuli season due to low and erratic rainfall borders are generally more profitable than terraces and flat cultivation during all three cropping seasons terraces is lucrative for purely rainfed beans with bcr of 1 5 208 7 usd ha and 1 2 90 5 usd ha when grown in masika and vuli respectively overall highest profitability with bcr 1 9 399 usd ha was found for beans grown on borders during chamazi season however it is not uncommon for farmers in semi arid areas such as the makanya catchment to implement more than one agricultural technique to grow crops the highest profitability of beans grown on borders during chamazi season as monocrop was because of irrigation after every two weeks for about two months access to irrigation presented borders with higher profitability over terraces and flat cultivation in this case previous studies such as bizoza and de graaff 2012 found terraces to be hardly profitable especially when supplementary irrigation was applied in makanya rainfed beans grown on terraces during masika and vuli seasons were found to be profitable possibly because the technique can preserve soil moisture alternatively also proposed by tenge et al 2005 higher profitability on terraces could be realized by growing higher value crops e g vegetables with relatively low investment costs bizoza and de graaff 2012 and matere et al 2016 suggested that this way terraces can be put to more intensive and productive use similarly a farmer during the survey said i have terraces but i do not grow maize or beans on it i grow vegetables instead because maize crop does not give any income unlike vegetables like okra or tomatoes ll 12 this point to the significance of choice of crop type as well as market price when implementing terraces changes in prices associated with sale of produce greatly impact on profitability as observed from results under uncertainty analysis 5 conclusion implementation of soil and water conservation swc techniques are crucial for crop production in arid and semi arid agro ecological zones of sub saharan africa this study investigated variation in profitability of growing staple crops maize beans lablab and cowpeas on two swc techniques terraces and borders when compared with the conventional flat cultivation in a normal year in the semi arid makanya catchment drawing from the above discussion masika season long rain presents relatively higher crop yields in all three techniques than vuli short rain where rainfall is low and erratic flat cultivation during the vuli season produced the lowest yields and hence not profitable to farmers growing beans instead of maize on terraces and flat cultivation during vuli is more profitable to farmers maize could be grown on borders during vuli season this study has shown that while swc techniques are known to be profitable their profitability varies with cropping seasons and crops grown moreover changes in produce prices greatly affect profitability of these techniques this study shows that knowledge of profitability of swc techniques per cropping season and crops grown is crucial to assist farmers in making decisions that will maximize their profits the decision table showing the most profitable practices per cropping season that was formulated for the three selected agricultural techniques and crops can be used to promote swc interventions the matrix can be used to explain to smallholder farmers the profitability of a selected technique in their context the decision table if used properly will allow farmers to maximize their profits from growing maize beans and lablab and optimize irrigation water use by reallocating the scarce water to higher priority crops the use of profit maximization technique may eventually lead to increased adoption of swc techniques in sub saharan african catchments declaration of competing

10436,subsurface tile drainage is a necessary practice for economic crop production in humid poorly drained regions of the world drainage water management dwm also known as controlled drainage is among the suite of practices designed to mitigate water quality issues associated with subsurface drainage studies evaluating dwm generally include field experiments or simulation models to estimate water quality impacts combining field studies with model simulations can provide a more comprehensive assessment furthermore using multiple approaches can provide a range of effectiveness rather than a single estimate which can help define the uncertainty associated with dwm effectiveness the goal of this study was to demonstrate the variability in estimated dwm effectiveness using 10 years of measured data and a calibrated hydrologic model the study field located in central ohio was under a free drainage fd mode from 2005 through 2008 and under dwm from 2009 through 2014 we used three approaches to compare discharge and nitrate concentrations and loads before and after paired field and drainmod nii simulated scenarios based on the three evaluation approaches dwm increased surface runoff by 50 13 mm reduced annual drainage discharge between 8 and 23 19 to 69 mm annual mean no3 n concentrations between 1 and 2 5 and no3 n loads between 9 and 25 2 8 to 10 3 kg ha 1 yr 1 dwm also reduced the frequency of drainage discharge and increased magnitudes of surface runoff evapotranspiration and seepage losses the true magnitude of dwm effectiveness remains somewhat uncertain especially in fields prone to seepage and runoff losses however using a combined assessment approach can help address the uncertainty associated with estimated dwm effectiveness at watershed and regional scales keywords controlled drainage drainmod hydrology subsurface drainage water quality modeling nutrients 1 introduction subsurface tile drainage is essential for economic crop production on a majority of soils in the u s midwest in addition to crop growth and management benefits subsurface drainage has been shown to alleviate soil erosion and nutrient transport fausey et al 1995 skaggs et al 2012a however other research suggests that drainage has adverse effects on water quality in receiving streams it has been established that agricultural drainage in the midwestern u s contributes approximately 35 of the total nitrogen n discharged by the mississippi river to the gulf of mexico goolsby et al 2000 resulting in one of the world s largest hypoxic zones david et al 2010 rabalais et al 2002 additionally recent studies have shown that subsurface drainage is a significant pathway for phosphorus p transport gentry et al 2007 king et al 2015b sims et al 1998 in ohio an estimated 3 million ha or 50 of total cropland is drained with a majority of that area under subsurface drainage zucker and brown 1998 in some counties of northwest ohio greater than 80 of the total county area is subsurface drained sugg 2007 various management practices e g dwm woodchip bioreactors and nutrient management have been recommended to address water quality issues associated with subsurface drainage david et al 2010 ross et al 2016 dwm is the practice of artificially raising the outlet elevation of a drainage system to potentially reduce drainage volume and nutrient loss usda nrcs 2001 with its potential benefits to water quality as well as crop yields e g ghane et al 2012 dwm has received considerable attention and is a key component of nutrient reduction strategies and frameworks across the us midwest skaggs et al 2012a however determining the effectiveness of dwm at specific sites and across scales is challenging due to varying soils climates and cropping systems ross et al 2016 when compared to free drainage fd i e original outlet elevation dwm reduced discharge by 17 80 and nitrate no3 n loads by 18 79 ross et al 2016 skaggs et al 2012a the changes in field hydrology under dwm also affect the fate and transport of nutrients furthermore crop production management cropping and fertility practices may alter the effectiveness of dwm king et al 2016 in general dwm does not affect no3 n concentrations thus any load reduction is mainly a result of reduced drainage volume cooke and verma 2012 fausey 2005 one of the most common monitoring approaches to quantify dwm effectiveness is conducting a before and after dwm experiment the effectiveness of dwm is assessed by comparing the discharge and nutrient load differences under dwm and fd however the before and after design cannot control for weather and other external factors such as crop management weather variability etc that may differ between the before and after periods the paired field design is an improvement over the before and after monitoring approach as it controls for the temporal variability of external factors the paired field design requires two experimental fields with similar soils drainage system design and cropping practices clausen and spooner 1993 following a baseline period dwm is implemented on one field treatment while the other field control is left under fd a key assumption in this approach is that discharge and loads from the treatment dwm and control fd field are independent of each other and a predictable relationship exists between the two fields however if the paired fields are hydraulically connected to each other or adjacent to an existing drainage feature the pre treatment relationship may change after dwm implementation thus biasing the estimated dwm effect lavaire et al 2017 several simulation tools models have been used to simulate subsurface drainage dwm and their impacts on hydrology and water quality examples include rzwqm fang et al 2012 rzwqm dssat thorp et al 2008 hydrus 2d salehi et al 2017 drainmod skaggs 1980 1978 and drainmod nii youssef et al 2005 the suite of drainmod based models particularly drainmod n and drainmod nii have been widely used to design and assess both fd and dwm in poorly drained agricultural soils brev√© et al 1997 ng et al 2002 salazar et al 2009 singh et al 2007 youssef et al 2018 while most dwm assessment studies rely on one of the approaches previously described i e before after paired field design or simulation ross et al 2016 youssef et al 2018 combining field studies with model simulations can facilitate a more comprehensive assessment measured data provides a means to quantify the effect on select parameters such as drainage discharge and nutrient loads however a calibrated model allows for other components of water and nutrient budgets e g evapotranspiration and crop nutrient uptake to be evaluated furthermore the combined approach provides additional insight into uncertainty and bias that a single approach cannot generate the goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of dwm on hydrology and n transport using 10 years of measured data and a calibrated hydrologic model and to quantify the variability in estimated dwm effectiveness the specific objectives of this study were to 1 validate the simulated magnitudes and seasonality of water and n budgets for the entire study period and 2 assess the range of dwm effects on water budget no3 n concentrations and no3 n loads using three different approaches before and after comparison paired field

located in central ohio fig 1 the ubwc watershed has a humid continental climate with approximately 160 growing days spanning late april through mid october king et al 2015a the average minimum and maximum temperatures for the watershed are 9 6 c in january and 33 9 c in july respectively ncdc 2014 the average annual rainfall recorded within the watershed is 985 mm ncdc 2014 annually approximately 500 mm of precipitation is received in the form of snow and frozen precipitation king et al 2015a the study field was systematically subsurface drained with a drainage area of 14 9 ha field b4 in fig 1 another outlet b2 drained an adjacent portion of the farm field which had a contributing area of 13 8 ha the two outlets drained distinct zones of the same farm field fig 1 the primary soils in both drainage areas are associations of bennington silt loam and pewamo clay loam and were near equally distributed the crop rotation nutrient management and tillage operations during the study period are summarized in king et al 2016 briefly a corn soybean rotation was followed using rotational tillage tillage only prior to corn and split application of n fertilizer a portion at planting with the remainder side dressed approximately one month later in fall of 2008 the b4 outlet was fitted with a water level control structure agridrain inc adair ia prior to the installation of the control structure outlets b2 and b4 were in a fd mode dwm was implemented from january 2009 through december 2014 during the non growing season and the drier portions of the growing season the outlet elevation was raised to approximately 45 cm below the field surface approximately three weeks prior to planting and harvesting the outlet was placed in fd mode to provide trafficability 2 2 data collection and water quality analysis the subsurface drainage outlets were monitored for discharge and water quality from 2005 through 2014 each outlet was fitted with a 30 cm diameter pipe having a compound weir insert thel mar llc brevard nc and an area velocity sensor isco 2150 teledyne isco lincoln ne stage and velocity were measured throughout the year at 30 min intervals discharge was estimated from the compound weir rating curve and area velocity sensor from march 1 to december 15 water quality samples were collected using an automated water sampler isco 6712 teledyne isco lincoln ne aliquots were collected every six hours and composited on a weekly basis in the winter when sample lines were frozen and automated samplers could not be used december 16 to february 28 weekly grab samples were collected from each tile outlet the water samples were analyzed for no3 n and total n using methods previously described by king et al 2015a 2 3 data analysis water budget components considered for comparison were precipitation measured drainage discharge measured and simulated and simulated surface runoff evapotranspiration et seepage and total water loss drainage plus surface runoff the number of days with non zero drainage discharge and surface runoff were also compared as a water budget parameter the nitrate losses were compared in terms of measured and simulated no3 n concentrations and loads daily drainage volume was calculated by summing the measured 30 minute incremental discharges no3 n loads were calculated using a mid point approach described by williams et al 2015 briefly the temporal mid point between two samples was determined and the concentration between the two midpoints was assumed to be representative over the sampling interval the resulting concentrations were then multiplied by the incremental volume to provide an incremental load daily load was calculated as the sum of incremental loads for the daily period measured and simulated daily hydrology and no3 n loads were summarized using descriptive statistics and summed over monthly seasonal and annual durations the no3 n concentrations were used to obtain daily means and other descriptive statistics at monthly and annual scales the growing season gs was defined as the period between planting and harvesting in general the gs extended from of the first of may to the end of october the periods before planting and after harvesting were considered the non growing season ngs the before and after approach compared mean water budget components no3 n concentrations and no3 n loads before and after the implementation of dwm we conducted this approach on both measured and simulated data the differences in magnitudes between the fd period 2005 2008 and dwm period 2009 2014 were compared using a 2 sample t test smith 2002 a percent change or reduction in discharge concentrations and loads in the dwm period was calculated with respect to the fd period the paired field approach was completed using methods outlined by clausen and spooner 1993 measured data drainage discharge no3 n concentrations and no3 n loads from b2 and b4 during the baseline fd period 2006 2008 were used to establish pre treatment linear relationships between the two fields these regression equations were then used with measured values from the control b2 site to predict discharge no3 n concentrations and no3 n loads at the treatment site b4 during the dwm years 2009 2014 the changes in discharge and no3 n loads at b4 were calculated by summing the daily difference between observed values system under dwm and predicted values system under fd the percent change or reduction was calculated with respect to predicted discharge and loads under fd simulated scenario based comparisons were completed using a calibrated drainmod nii model to simulate water budget no3 n concentrations and no3 n loads at b4 under fd for the 2009 2014 period simulated water budget no3 n concentrations and no3 n loads under fd were compared with those simulated under dwm using a paired t test smith 2002 percent changes in water budget and no3 n loads were calculated by taking the difference between magnitudes simulated under fd and dwm and dividing by the magnitudes simulated under fd all statistical analyses were conducted using minitab statistical software minitab inc and using a 0 05 significance level 2 4 drainmod nii model inputs calibration and validation the drainage related properties of each layer of the two soil series within the field were obtained from the nrcs web soil survey and processed through the rosetta version 1 0 model schaap et al 2001 to create required soil inputs for the drainmod nii model using satellite imagery and producer input systematic subsurface

timing peaks and magnitudes of simulated daily discharge were within an acceptable range of accuracy except during transitional winter days when minimum daily temperatures fell below freezing and maximum daily temperatures were above freezing fig 2 overall the model performance for daily drainage during calibration and validation can be classified as satisfactory to good moriasi et al 2007 skaggs et al 2012b model performance improved for annual discharge with better accuracy during the validation period than the calibration period table 1 overall drainmod nii was able to represent annual drainage during all years table 1 annual precipitation during the study period ranged from 764 mm to 1216 mm with a mean of 1002 mm approximately 95 of the incident rainfall was simulated to infiltrate into the soil while 5 was lost through surface runoff table 2 sixty nine percent of annual precipitation was estimated to evaporate or transpire and 26 was discharged from the field as subsurface drainage a small amount 10 mm of infiltrated water was simulated to have been lost through seepage mean annual simulated discharge 256 mm was essentially identical to mean measured discharge 257 mm table 2 with the greatest magnitude 370 mm in 2011 in response to 1216 mm of precipitation and less than 190 mm during drier years 2009 2010 and 2012 mean daily drainage discharge over the period of record was 0 7 mm which included days with zero flow eighty percent of total annual simulated discharge occurred during the ngs and was consistent with measured 76 data table 2 similar ngs findings 50 85 were reported by bjorneberg et al 1996 for loamy textured soils in iowa subjected to corn soybean and continuous corn production likewise macrae et al 2007 reported that the majority of discharges in the strawberry creek watershed in southern ontario occurred during the ngs simulated mean annual runoff was 50 mm and accounted for only 5 of total precipitation and about 16 of the total surface plus subsurface discharge table 2 simulated surface runoff occurred on only eight days per year 6 mm of runoff volume per event a majority of runoff occurred during the ngs mean 37 mm triggered by spring snowmelt during fd years simulated runoff was 54 mm 81 compared to 26 mm 67 during dwm years table 2 mean et during the study period was simulated to be 686 mm or 70 of annual precipitation table 2 despite similar precipitation between the gs 528 mm and ngs 474 mm there was a stark contrast in gs et 483 mm compared to ngs et 204 mm 3 1 2 effect of dwm on water budget 3 1 2 1 before and after comparison mean annual rainfall during the before fd period 2005 2008 1067 mm was greater than that for the after dwm period 2009 2014 958 mm although they were not statistically different 2 sample t test p 0 05 table 2 expressed as a fraction of annual precipitation measured discharge table 2 decreased from 28 during the fd period to 24 during the dwm period drainage discharge was observed on 205 days per year during the fd period compared to 262 days per year during the dwm period thus before and after comparison of measured data suggested that dwm reduced drainage discharge volume but increased the number of days with discharge the greater number of discharge days were likely a combination of greater rainfall during dwm years and reduced water storage capacity of soil due to a higher water table when the field was subjected to dwm a comparison of measured mean annual discharges during fd years versus dwm years indicates a 23 reduction due to dwm table 2 while comparison of mean annual simulated drainage during fd years versus dwm years predicted a 35 reduction however in contrast to measured data the reduction in simulated discharge was also accompanied by a decrease in the number of discharge days 172 to 136 under dwm table 2 other studies have suggested a likely increase in surface runoff due to implementation of dwm ross et al 2016 however less surface runoff was simulated during dwm years 39 mm compared to fd years 66 mm the proportion of simulated surface runoff compared to annual rainfall was also less during dwm years 4 compared to fd years 6 the reduction in annual runoff during dwm years table 2 may be attributed to the increase in annual et during these years mean daily simulated et in fd years 1 8 mm day 1 and dwm years 1 9 mm day 1 were not significantly different however when evaluating mean gs daily et between fd 2 8 mm day 1 and dwm 2 mm day 1 periods the difference was significant p 0 05 the increase in gs et was attributed to an increase in gs precipitation between the periods and slightly warmer temperatures 0 3 c that may have caused an increase in et and changed antecedent moisture conditions consequently resulting in increased infiltration with an associated decrease in surface runoff although seepage was simulated to be a small fraction of the total water budget the dwm years had greater seepage losses 12 mm than the fd years 8 mm the increase in seepage is a result of greater hydraulic gradient caused by a raised water table when the outlet is in dwm mode the average water table depth simulated during dwm years 1063 mm from surface was significantly greater than that during fd years 1147 mm from surface a simulation study by youssef et al 2018 for 48 sites across the midwestern u s showed an increase in et 5 or 27 mm yr 1 and vertical seepage 23 or 9 mm yr 1 under dwm compared to fd 3 1 2 2 paired field comparison estimated reductions from dwm implementation using the paired field approach ranged from 69 to 137 mm 57 to 31 with an average of 23 mm 9 3 tables 3 4 negative estimates of reductions occurred during the dry years of 2010 and 2012 and were likely caused by intermittent low flow events at only one of the outlets the regression model failed to predict flows at outlet b4 when no flow was observed at outlet b2 this may have resulted in lesser discharge estimates at b4 under fd compared to those observed under dwm williams et al 2015 used a similar approach to predict discharge from b4 during 2009 2012 assuming the absence of dwm and estimated a mean 23 69 mm reduction in drainage discharge the difference in the two estimates was attributed to the inclusion of 2 years of additional data in the current study used to develop linear regression equations between discharges from b2 and b4 3 1 2 3 simulated scenario based comparison differences in simulated drainage discharge between fd and dwm ranged from 2 7 to 14 8 during 2009 2014 with an average reduction of 8 3 19 mm table 3 in contrast to the before and after comparison of measured data the number of days with discharge was reduced from 167 in fd to 136 in dwm although the observed and simulated annual drainage discharges showed a linear response to annual rainfall the reduction in drainage outflow was not uniform across the range of annual precipitation for example precipitation totals for 2010 and 2013 were different by 277 mm yet each year was simulated to have a similar reduction in drainage discharge 14 and 14 8 respectively furthermore the reduction was estimated to be only 6 for the wettest year 2011 among the years with dwm surface runoff accounted for 16 of total outflow runoff plus drainage under dwm and about 10 during fd average annual surface runoff simulated under dwm was greater 39 mm than that under fd 26 mm suggesting a 49 increase table 3 although the percent increase in runoff simulated in the immediate study was greater than the percent reduction in drainage the magnitude of change in runoff was only a small fraction of the total water loss 13 mm out of 250 mm table 3 the average water table depth simulated under dwm 1063 mm from surface was significantly greater than that under the fd scenario 1171 mm from surface thus a higher water table and relatively wetter soil profile under dwm likely increased the loss of water through surface pathways in comparison ross et al 2016 summarized surface runoff volumes from 10 studies comparing dwm and fd while the data summarized for field studies suggested a 33 28 mm increase in surface runoff under dwm inclusion of modeling studies changed the estimate to a 154 60 mm increase a comprehensive modeling study by youssef et al 2018 for 48 sites across the midwestern u s showed a 123 or 48 mm increase in surface runoff from dwm compared to fd a similar increase in surface runoff was observed by drury et al 2009 1996 tan and zhang 2011 and tan et al 2002 in fields with dwm and sub irrigation treatments a common observation in dwm related studies is that the volumetric reduction in drainage outflow is translated into an increase in surface runoff ale et al 2009 evans et al 1995 gilliam and skaggs 1986 thus total discharge surface plus subsurface loss of water becomes an important indicator of the hydrologic effect of dwm the annual total water loss under dwm was reduced by an average of 2 5 6 mm the magnitude of reduction varied annually and ranged from 0 3 to 5 7 average annual et was 693 mm under fd compared to 697 mm under dwm suggesting an increase of about 4 mm or 0 6 furthermore average annual seepage loss from the field was estimated to be 9 mm under fd mode and 11 mm under dwm mode thus the increase in total losses through et plus seepage 6 mm was equivalent to the reduction in total loss through runoff and subsurface drainage therefore dwm reduced the total loss of water from the field attributable to increased et and seepage during the high water table periods in general the ranges and magnitudes of water budget components in the current study are similar to those summarized by ross et al 2016 youssef et al 2018 and liu et al 2019 the three analysis methods agree that dwm reduces drainage volume but differ in their estimates of the magnitude of reduction although increased surface runoff may negate a portion of the reduction in subsurface drainage dwm is still likely to reduce the net water loss through increased et and seepage during high water table conditions crop type magnitude and temporal distribution of rainfall and air temperatures may also affect the inter annual variation of reduction king et al 2016 ross et al 2016 3 2 nitrate loss 3 2 1 measured and simulated nitrate loss measured mean daily no3 n concentration calculated at the annual time scale was 10 1 mg l 1 range 4 3 24 5 mg l 1 and was comparable to the simulated mean daily concentration of 9 1 mg l 1 range 4 7 32 mg l 1 table 2 a large increase in 2009 concentrations was due to a one time poultry manure application and was captured in both measured and predicted values however the model failed to predict the gradual decrease that occurred in subsequent years williams et al 2015 estimated a greater mean annual concentration 16 9 mg l 1 from the same site but their calculations were based on only days with non zero flow and the duration of measurement was shorter than the current study 2006 to 2012 versus 2005 2014 both measured and simulated concentrations were comparable to those reported for similar rotations in illinois gentry et al 1998 9 15 mg l 1 and indiana kladivko et al 2004 7 31 mg l 1 measured annual no3 n loads ranged from 13 5 kg ha 1 2012 to 49 7 kg ha 1 2005 with an average of 32 4 kg ha 1 table 2 in general greater annual no3 n loads were measured in corn years compared to soybean years however in 2007 and 2008 when soybean was planted greater annual no3 n loads were measured and were most likely a response to a fall 2007 chicken litter application weekly no3 n loads were generally underestimated nse 0 28 r2 0 45 during calibration and validation periods however the model performance improved for monthly seasonal and annual predictions table 1 measured and simulated annual no3 n loads were consistent with those reported in other similar studies ale et al 2012 fausey et al 1995 the no3 n loads were consistently under predicted during the fd years but not during dwm years table 2 the stark difference in simulated and observed no3 n loads in 2010 may be attributed to suppressed crop yields due to the excessively dry year this suggests that a portion of available nitrogen was not utilized by the crop that year resulting in greater observed no3n losses table 2 drainmod nii was not able to capture this phenomenon most likely because measured yields and biomass were not collected or available for calibration seventy three percent of total annual no3 n loads 23 6 out of 32 4 kg ha 1 were observed to occur in the ngs a result of greater discharge volumes table 2 similar findings related to timing of no3 n loads were previously reported for the b4 field king et al 2016 2015a 3 2 2 effect of dwm on nitrate loss 3 2 2 1 before and after comparison the mean daily no3 n concentration during dwm years was significantly greater than that during fd years table 2 two sample t test p 0 05 furthermore the mean daily concentrations were significantly greater in most months of dwm years than those of fd years appendix 2 two sample t test p 0 05 this was unexpected since higher water tables associated with dwm generally promote anaerobic conditions and denitrification resulting in lesser concentrations when compared to fd the expected effects of dwm on no3 n concentration seem to have been masked due to elevated concentrations during these periods thus the increase in concentrations may be due to the combined effects of fertilizer application in 2009 and a large poultry litter application in fall of 2007 compared to the fd years mean annual no3 n loads after dwm implementation reduced by 8 4 kg ha 1 from 37 4 to 29 kg ha 1 table 4 suggesting a reduction of 22 5 however the reduction estimated from simulated data was much less 1 7 kg ha 1 or 6 despite the elevated concentrations during dwm years the lower no3 n loads during dwm years than those during fd years suggested that the load reduction under dwm was primarily due to the reduction in discharge while the results from the before and after comparison are consistent with findings from other studies fausey 2004 williams et al 2015 the temporal variability of factors such as weather and management operations may bias the estimate of dwm effectiveness a paired field comparison helps control for such temporal effects 3 2 2 2 paired field comparison the predicted concentrations at outlet b4 using the developed relationship between b2 and b4 2006 2008 r2 0 85 table 4 footnote suggested that mean daily no3 n concentration during 2009 2014 would be 11 9 mg l 1 under fd compared to 11 6 mg l 1 under dwm table 4 the concentrations were not significantly different in general the concentrations under dwm tended to be less than those in fd during ngs months and similar or slightly greater during gs months when both outlets were in fd mode thus the effect of dwm on mean concentrations may be negligible as the slight decrease in concentrations during the ngs is balanced by a slight increase in concentrations during the gs similar findings using paired field assessments of dwm have been reported by williams et al 2015 and ross et al 2016 the paired field approach indicated that dwm significantly reduced annual no3 n load by 25 3 or 10 3 kg ha 1 table 3 however in dry years 2010 and 2012 an increase in no3 n load was measured the mean daily no3 n loads during the fd period 0 11 kg ha 1 were greater than loads in the dwm period 0 08 kg ha 1 table 3 using a similar paired field approach williams et al 2015 estimated a 21 reduction in no3 n load at the same site the estimated load reduction using the paired field approach was similar to that from the before and after comparison table 4 however the paired field approach provides further insights into inter annual variability of dwm effectiveness for example a closer look at annual estimated discharge and load reductions table 3 suggests that even a small discharge reduction 9 under dwm may lead to a greater percent reduction in nitrate load 25 3 2 2 3 simulated scenario based comparison no significant differences in mean daily no3 n concentrations were noted between the simulated fd 10 8 mg l 1 and dwm 10 9 mg l 1 scenarios during 2009 2014 table 2 table 4 similar trends were present in mean daily concentrations at monthly time scales fig 3 a in general ngs mean concentrations were lesser under dwm than under fd while the gs mean concentrations were similar between dwm and fd scenarios despite the effects of dwm on no3 n concentrations in the ngs months dwm did not have a significant impact on mean daily no3 n concentrations at annual scales similar findings regarding no differences in no3 n concentrations have been reported by williams et al 2015 fausey 2004 wesstr√∂m et al 2001 and lavaire et al 2017 conversely other studies suggest that dwm reduces no3 n concentrations in drainage water by promoting denitrification adeuya et al 2012 fausey 2005 lalonde et al 1996 liu et al 2019 ng et al 2002 while still others report increases in no3 n concentrations under dwm poole et al 2018 the simulated mean annual no3 n loads under fd and dwm were 29 5 and 26 8 kg ha 1 respectively and the differences between fd and dwm loads were statistically significant p 0 05 table 3 unlike the paired field approach a reduction in no3 n loads under dwm was present even in the dry years of 2010 and 2012 table 3 overall the simulated scenarios suggest that dwm reduced mean annual no3 n loads by 2 8 kg ha 1 or 9 3 table 4 the average monthly no3 n loads were consistently greater under fd than under dwm however the differences were non significant p 0 05 fig 3b the magnitude of reductions in simulated no3 n loads 2 3 13 7 under dwm in the current study was less than that reported in other simulation studies e g 45 by ross et al 2016 32 by youssef et al 2018 or paired field studies e g 21 by williams et al 2015 45 by fausey 2004 26 35 by skaggs et al 2012a 51 79 by cooke and verma 2012 the three methods discussed above differ in magnitudes of estimated no3 n load reduction ranging from 2 8 to 10 3 kg ha 1 the paired field and simulated scenario based comparisons suggest that the ngs no3 n concentrations tend to be lesser under dwm than fd specifically during the periods when the outlet is in dwm mode however the differences in no3 n concentrations are significant across only a few months of the ngs these results suggest that dwm reduced the loss of no3 n primarily through reduction of discharge rather than denitrification thus reductions in no3 n loads are expected to follow trends similar to those in drainage discharge volume fausey 2005 ross et al 2016 for example the greatest reductions in both discharge and no3 n loads were estimated for 2013 which was also the wettest year however similar reductions in no3 n loads 13 4 were simulated for 2014 with only a 2 7 reduction in drainage discharge thus the benefit of dwm in terms of no3 n load reduction varies temporally and may not be attributed solely to the reduction in drainage outflows or concentrations additional factors such as weather crop type fertilizer management and organic matter dynamics likely play a role in nitrogen dynamics even under dwm king et al 2016 ross et al 2016 3 3 uncertainty in estimating effects of dwm the estimated effects of dwm using the three approaches ranged from reductions of 8 23 for discharge 1 to 2 5 for no3 n concentrations and 9 25 for no3 n loads table 4 most studies utilize one approach and so understanding the uncertainty associated with a given approach is essential uncertainty in the before and after approach is introduced from uncontrolled factors such as the interannual variability of climatic parameters the paired field design overcomes this limitation by pairing the treatment field with a control field however uncertainty with the paired field method arises when the underlying assumptions of the statistical design are violated for example if the control field response changes between control and treatment periods clausen and spooner 1993 shedekar et al 2017 outlets b2 and b4 drain adjacent parts of the same large field and are hydraulically connected most of the area drained by b4 is at a higher elevation compared to that drained by b2 fig 1 thus implementing dwm in b4 may have influenced the hydrologic response of b2 affecting the relationship between outlet discharges during dwm years using the pre dwm linear relationship in such a scenario may lead to over prediction of outflows from b4 for a system under fd and result in over prediction of discharge reduction under dwm thus a paired field comparison in such scenarios may over estimate the dwm effectiveness in terms of discharge as well as n loads shedekar et al 2017 with respect to the simulation approach the source of uncertainty is in model parameterization and assumptions for example drainmod nii assumes a relatively flat field with uniform water table across the entire field due to the set weir depth however for a large field with gentle slope the actual zone of influence area with high water table due to dwm may be smaller than expected leading to erroneous simulated results shedekar et al 2017 furthermore presence of a drainage channel within 30 to 100 m of the field may significantly affect the water table and drainage discharge fipps and skaggs 1986 such scenarios potentially affect model outcomes and should be considered during the model parameterization process while many studies report reductions in drainage discharge few studies evaluate the associated increase in surface runoff and seepage losses if an increase in the surface or subsurface pathways is substantial a perceived reduction in drainage discharge may need to be re evaluated large scale assessments of dwm typically rely on evidence from observational or modeling studies the reported magnitudes of dwm effectiveness tend to be averages across the study periods and or study sites furthermore it is important to recognize that dwm effectiveness is not consistent across years sites and management the high spatio temporal variability of dwm effectiveness is evident even in replicated plot studies saadat et al 2018 with several factors affecting water budget and water quality under dwm using a single assessment approach may lead to biased estimates of its effectiveness for example thorp et al 2008 used rzwqm dssat at 48 locations across the us midwest and estimated that dwm could reduce nitrate losses by 7 1 to 49 6 kg ha 1 yr 1 33 60 compared to fd jaynes et al 2010 extrapolated the results of thorp et al 2008 across the mississippi river basin and estimated that dwm would reduce no3 n losses to surface waters by 83 million kg yr 1 they concluded that dwm would have potential to meet 6 of the desired 45 reduction goal set forth by the hypoxia task force for the gulf of mexico mississippi river gulf of mexico watershed nutrient task force 2008 such studies however fail to recognize the uncertainty associated with the field scale assessments that propagates into large scale estimates implementing dwm in isolated pockets or fields over large areas may simply reroute the flow pathways to adjacent un managed fields and ditches through lateral seepage and runoff further reducing the practice s effectiveness thus understanding the methods and uncertainty associated with quantifying the effectiveness of dwm is essential in assessing large scale dwm adoption an average value or a range of values to represent annual performance of dwm may still be inadequate for scaling up dwm effectiveness across sites instead of using a single value or a range of values that remain static across years and sites a probabilistic approach that accounts for the stochasticity of the practice effectiveness across time and scales may be more appropriate for assessing dwm impacts to facilitate adoption of such new approaches large datasets that combine multiple short and long term monitoring and modeling studies at regional scales may be essential in near future to increase the confidence in dwm performance assessment the future dwm research shall focus on tracking the complete water and nutrient budgets within and across field boundaries 4 summary and conclusions this study used multiple methods and evaluated water budget components other than drainage or runoff to better understand the range of dwm effectiveness three approaches before and after comparison paired field comparison and simulated scenario based comparison were used to estimate the effectiveness of dwm at the outlet of a systematically drained agricultural field in central ohio based on the three assessment approaches we find that dwm reduced annual drainage discharge by 8 to 23 19 to 69 mm increased surface runoff by 50 but accounted for only 3 to 4 of annual precipitation 13 mm reduced total water loss surface runoff plus subsurface drainage by an average of 2 5 attributable to increased losses through et and seepage 6 mm decreased the number of days having subsurface drainage while increasing the number of days having surface runoff decreased mean no3 n concentrations by 1 to 2 5 on annual basis with a reduction of up to 10 in the non growing season decreased no3 n loads in subsurface drainage discharge by 9 to 25 2 8 to 10 3 kg ha 1 yr 1 these findings suggest that although increased surface runoff may negate a portion of the reduction in subsurface drainage dwm is still likely to reduce the net water loss through increased et and seepage during high water table conditions although the observed and simulated data show a likely reduction in drainage and no3 n loads under dwm the true benefit of dwm remains uncertain in fields prone to seepage and runoff losses as well as those where the zone of influence is significantly less than the total contributing area therefore a strategic adoption of dwm across contiguous landscapes and drainage networks may be essential for maximizing the benefits of the practice furthermore implementing dwm in a paired field that is adjacent to the control field or a drainage ditch may considerably affect hydraulic gradients as well as water and nutrient balances leading to under or over estimation of dwm effectiveness using a combined assessment approach may help address the uncertainty and bias associated with estimating dwm effectiveness at watershed and regional scales thus understanding the method used to assess the effectiveness of dwm as well as the uncertainty associated with that method is essential for realizing the true potential of the

10436,subsurface tile drainage is a necessary practice for economic crop production in humid poorly drained regions of the world drainage water management dwm also known as controlled drainage is among the suite of practices designed to mitigate water quality issues associated with subsurface drainage studies evaluating dwm generally include field experiments or simulation models to estimate water quality impacts combining field studies with model simulations can provide a more comprehensive assessment furthermore using multiple approaches can provide a range of effectiveness rather than a single estimate which can help define the uncertainty associated with dwm effectiveness the goal of this study was to demonstrate the variability in estimated dwm effectiveness using 10 years of measured data and a calibrated hydrologic model the study field located in central ohio was under a free drainage fd mode from 2005 through 2008 and under dwm from 2009 through 2014 we used three approaches to compare discharge and nitrate concentrations and loads before and after paired field and drainmod nii simulated scenarios based on the three evaluation approaches dwm increased surface runoff by 50 13 mm reduced annual drainage discharge between 8 and 23 19 to 69 mm annual mean no3 n concentrations between 1 and 2 5 and no3 n loads between 9 and 25 2 8 to 10 3 kg ha 1 yr 1 dwm also reduced the frequency of drainage discharge and increased magnitudes of surface runoff evapotranspiration and seepage losses the true magnitude of dwm effectiveness remains somewhat uncertain especially in fields prone to seepage and runoff losses however using a combined assessment approach can help address the uncertainty associated with estimated dwm effectiveness at watershed and regional scales keywords controlled drainage drainmod hydrology subsurface drainage water quality modeling nutrients 1 introduction subsurface tile drainage is essential for economic crop production on a majority of soils in the u s midwest in addition to crop growth and management benefits subsurface drainage has been shown to alleviate soil erosion and nutrient transport fausey et al 1995 skaggs et al 2012a however other research suggests that drainage has adverse effects on water quality in receiving streams it has been established that agricultural drainage in the midwestern u s contributes approximately 35 of the total nitrogen n discharged by the mississippi river to the gulf of mexico goolsby et al 2000 resulting in one of the world s largest hypoxic zones david et al 2010 rabalais et al 2002 additionally recent studies have shown that subsurface drainage is a significant pathway for phosphorus p transport gentry et al 2007 king et al 2015b sims et al 1998 in ohio an estimated 3 million ha or 50 of total cropland is drained with a majority of that area under subsurface drainage zucker and brown 1998 in some counties of northwest ohio greater than 80 of the total county area is subsurface drained sugg 2007 various management practices e g dwm woodchip bioreactors and nutrient management have been recommended to address water quality issues associated with subsurface drainage david et al 2010 ross et al 2016 dwm is the practice of artificially raising the outlet elevation of a drainage system to potentially reduce drainage volume and nutrient loss usda nrcs 2001 with its potential benefits to water quality as well as crop yields e g ghane et al 2012 dwm has received considerable attention and is a key component of nutrient reduction strategies and frameworks across the us midwest skaggs et al 2012a however determining the effectiveness of dwm at specific sites and across scales is challenging due to varying soils climates and cropping systems ross et al 2016 when compared to free drainage fd i e original outlet elevation dwm reduced discharge by 17 80 and nitrate no3 n loads by 18 79 ross et al 2016 skaggs et al 2012a the changes in field hydrology under dwm also affect the fate and transport of nutrients furthermore crop production management cropping and fertility practices may alter the effectiveness of dwm king et al 2016 in general dwm does not affect no3 n concentrations thus any load reduction is mainly a result of reduced drainage volume cooke and verma 2012 fausey 2005 one of the most common monitoring approaches to quantify dwm effectiveness is conducting a before and after dwm experiment the effectiveness of dwm is assessed by comparing the discharge and nutrient load differences under dwm and fd however the before and after design cannot control for weather and other external factors such as crop management weather variability etc that may differ between the before and after periods the paired field design is an improvement over the before and after monitoring approach as it controls for the temporal variability of external factors the paired field design requires two experimental fields with similar soils drainage system design and cropping practices clausen and spooner 1993 following a baseline period dwm is implemented on one field treatment while the other field control is left under fd a key assumption in this approach is that discharge and loads from the treatment dwm and control fd field are independent of each other and a predictable relationship exists between the two fields however if the paired fields are hydraulically connected to each other or adjacent to an existing drainage feature the pre treatment relationship may change after dwm implementation thus biasing the estimated dwm effect lavaire et al 2017 several simulation tools models have been used to simulate subsurface drainage dwm and their impacts on hydrology and water quality examples include rzwqm fang et al 2012 rzwqm dssat thorp et al 2008 hydrus 2d salehi et al 2017 drainmod skaggs 1980 1978 and drainmod nii youssef et al 2005 the suite of drainmod based models particularly drainmod n and drainmod nii have been widely used to design and assess both fd and dwm in poorly drained agricultural soils brev√© et al 1997 ng et al 2002 salazar et al 2009 singh et al 2007 youssef et al 2018 while most dwm assessment studies rely on one of the approaches previously described i e before after paired field design or simulation ross et al 2016 youssef et al 2018 combining field studies with model simulations can facilitate a more comprehensive assessment measured data provides a means to quantify the effect on select parameters such as drainage discharge and nutrient loads however a calibrated model allows for other components of water and nutrient budgets e g evapotranspiration and crop nutrient uptake to be evaluated furthermore the combined approach provides additional insight into uncertainty and bias that a single approach cannot generate the goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of dwm on hydrology and n transport using 10 years of measured data and a calibrated hydrologic model and to quantify the variability in estimated dwm effectiveness the specific objectives of this study were to 1 validate the simulated magnitudes and seasonality of water and n budgets for the entire study period and 2 assess the range of dwm effects on water budget no3 n concentrations and no3 n loads using three different approaches before and after comparison paired field comparison and simulated scenario based comparison 2 material and methods 2 1 site description the study site was a privately owned field within the 492 km2 upper big walnut creek ubwc watershed located in central ohio fig 1 the ubwc watershed has a humid continental climate with approximately 160 growing days spanning late april through mid october king et al 2015a the average minimum and maximum temperatures for the watershed are 9 6 c in january and 33 9 c in july respectively ncdc 2014 the average annual rainfall recorded within the watershed is 985 mm ncdc 2014 annually approximately 500 mm of precipitation is received in the form of snow and frozen precipitation king et al 2015a the study field was systematically subsurface drained with a drainage area of 14 9 ha field b4 in fig 1 another outlet b2 drained an adjacent portion of the farm field which had a contributing area of 13 8 ha the two outlets drained distinct zones of the same farm field fig 1 the primary soils in both drainage areas are associations of bennington silt loam and pewamo clay loam and were near equally distributed the crop rotation nutrient management and tillage operations during the study period are summarized in king et al 2016 briefly a corn soybean rotation was followed using rotational tillage tillage only prior to corn and split application of n fertilizer a portion at planting with the remainder side dressed approximately one month later in fall of 2008 the b4 outlet was fitted with a water level control structure agridrain inc adair ia prior to the installation of the control structure outlets b2 and b4 were in a fd mode dwm was implemented from january 2009 through december 2014 during the non growing season and the drier portions of the growing season the outlet elevation was raised to approximately 45 cm below the field surface approximately three weeks prior to planting and harvesting the outlet was placed in fd mode to provide trafficability 2 2 data collection and water quality analysis the subsurface drainage outlets were monitored for discharge and water quality from 2005 through 2014 each outlet was fitted with a 30 cm diameter pipe having a compound weir insert thel mar llc brevard nc and an area velocity sensor isco 2150 teledyne isco lincoln ne stage and velocity were measured throughout the year at 30 min intervals discharge was estimated from the compound weir rating curve and area velocity sensor from march 1 to december 15 water quality samples were collected using an automated water sampler isco 6712 teledyne isco lincoln ne aliquots were collected every six hours and composited on a weekly basis in the winter when sample lines were frozen and automated samplers could not be used december 16 to february 28 weekly grab samples were collected from each tile outlet the water samples were analyzed for no3 n and total n using methods previously described by king et al 2015a 2 3 data analysis water budget components considered for comparison were precipitation measured drainage discharge measured and simulated and simulated surface runoff evapotranspiration et seepage and total water loss drainage plus surface runoff the number of days with non zero drainage discharge and surface runoff were also compared as a water budget parameter the nitrate losses were compared in terms of measured and simulated no3 n concentrations and loads daily drainage volume was calculated by summing the measured 30 minute incremental discharges no3 n loads were calculated using a mid point approach described by williams et al 2015 briefly the temporal mid point between two samples was determined and the concentration between the two midpoints was assumed to be representative over the sampling interval the resulting concentrations were then multiplied by the incremental volume to provide an incremental load daily load was calculated as the sum of incremental loads for the daily period measured and simulated daily hydrology and no3 n loads were summarized using descriptive statistics and summed over monthly seasonal and annual durations the no3 n concentrations were used to obtain daily means and other descriptive statistics at monthly and annual scales the growing season gs was defined as the period between planting and harvesting in general the gs extended from of the first of may to the end of october the periods before planting and after harvesting were considered the non growing season ngs the before and after approach compared mean water budget components no3 n concentrations and no3 n loads before and after the implementation of dwm we conducted this approach on both measured and simulated data the differences in magnitudes between the fd period 2005 2008 and dwm period 2009 2014 were compared using a 2 sample t test smith 2002 a percent change or reduction in discharge concentrations and loads in the dwm period was calculated with respect to the fd period the paired field approach was completed using methods outlined by clausen and spooner 1993 measured data drainage discharge no3 n concentrations and no3 n loads from b2 and b4 during the baseline fd period 2006 2008 were used to establish pre treatment linear relationships between the two fields these regression equations were then used with measured values from the control b2 site to predict discharge no3 n concentrations and no3 n loads at the treatment site b4 during the dwm years 2009 2014 the changes in discharge and no3 n loads at b4 were calculated by summing the daily difference between observed values system under dwm and predicted values system under fd the percent change or reduction was calculated with respect to predicted discharge and loads under fd simulated scenario based comparisons were completed using a calibrated drainmod nii model to simulate water budget no3 n concentrations and no3 n loads at b4 under fd for the 2009 2014 period simulated water budget no3 n concentrations and no3 n loads under fd were compared with those simulated under dwm using a paired t test smith 2002 percent changes in water budget and no3 n loads were calculated by taking the difference between magnitudes simulated under fd and dwm and dividing by the magnitudes simulated under fd all statistical analyses were conducted using minitab statistical software minitab inc and using a 0 05 significance level 2 4 drainmod nii model inputs calibration and validation the drainage related properties of each layer of the two soil series within the field were obtained from the nrcs web soil survey and processed through the rosetta version 1 0 model schaap et al 2001 to create required soil inputs for the drainmod nii model using satellite imagery and producer input systematic subsurface drainage systems were estimated to have a lateral spacing of 12 2 m 40 ft and a drain depth of 90 cm 3 ft drainage intensity di which represents the drainage rate when the water table midway between parallel drains is coincident with the surface skaggs 2017 was calculated to be 1 cm day 1 for bennington and 1 44 cm day 1 for pewamo series based on the maximum pipe capacity the drainage coefficient was estimated to be 2 25 cm day 1 hourly precipitation data were collected on site using a tipping bucket rain gauge texas electronics inc dallas tx and corrected as warranted using methods presented by shedekar et al 2016 daily maximum and minimum temperatures were obtained from an ohio agricultural research and development center oardc weather station near delaware oh approximately 15 km from the study site noaa ncdc 2013 the heat index value and initial values of monthly potential et pet factors were based on skaggs et al 1981 and oztekin et al 1999 initial n transport e g nitrification denitrification and urea hydrolysis carbon cycling and organic matter content parameters were obtained from published values ale et al 2013 2012 2009 baker 2002 youssef et al 2005 calibration was conducted using measured daily discharge and weekly no3 n load data coincident with measured no3 n concentrations model calibration was conducted by adjusting parameters related to hydrology crop yields and plant and grain n content appendix 1 and shedekar 2016 measured data from calendar years 2006 and 2011 were used for calibration while data from 2007 and 2012 were used for validation these periods were selected to ensure representation during periods of fd and dwm as well as capturing relatively dry and wet periods model validation was completed at daily monthly and annual time scales using nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias root mean square error rmse slope of best fit regression line and coefficient of determination r2 as discussed by moriasi et al 2007 and shedekar 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 water budget 3 1 1 measured and simulated water budget the calibrated drainmod nii model showed good agreement between daily measured and simulated discharge nse 0 52 r2 0 57 table 1 the agreement between measured and simulated discharge improved considerably during the validation period nse 0 71 r2 0 73 table 1 in general the timing peaks and magnitudes of simulated daily discharge were within an acceptable range of accuracy except during transitional winter days when minimum daily temperatures fell below freezing and maximum daily temperatures were above freezing fig 2 overall the model performance for daily drainage during calibration and validation can be classified as satisfactory to good moriasi et al 2007 skaggs et al 2012b model performance improved for annual discharge with better accuracy during the validation period than the calibration period table 1 overall drainmod nii was able to represent annual drainage during all years table 1 annual precipitation during the study period ranged from 764 mm to 1216 mm with a mean of 1002 mm approximately 95 of the incident rainfall was simulated to infiltrate into the soil while 5 was lost through surface runoff table 2 sixty nine percent of annual precipitation was estimated to evaporate or transpire and 26 was discharged from the field as subsurface drainage a small amount 10 mm of infiltrated water was simulated to have been lost through seepage mean annual simulated discharge 256 mm was essentially identical to mean measured discharge 257 mm table 2 with the greatest magnitude 370 mm in 2011 in response to 1216 mm of precipitation and less than 190 mm during drier years 2009 2010 and 2012 mean daily drainage discharge over the period of record was 0 7 mm which included days with zero flow eighty percent of total annual simulated discharge occurred during the ngs and was consistent with measured 76 data table 2 similar ngs findings 50 85 were reported by bjorneberg et al 1996 for loamy textured soils in iowa subjected to corn soybean and continuous corn production likewise macrae et al 2007 reported that the majority of discharges in the strawberry creek watershed in southern ontario occurred during the ngs simulated mean annual runoff was 50 mm and accounted for only 5 of total precipitation and about 16 of the total surface plus subsurface discharge table 2 simulated surface runoff occurred on only eight days per year 6 mm of runoff volume per event a majority of runoff occurred during the ngs mean 37 mm triggered by spring snowmelt during fd years simulated runoff was 54 mm 81 compared to 26 mm 67 during dwm years table 2 mean et during the study period was simulated to be 686 mm or 70 of annual precipitation table 2 despite similar precipitation between the gs 528 mm and ngs 474 mm there was a stark contrast in gs et 483 mm compared to ngs et 204 mm 3 1 2 effect of dwm on water budget 3 1 2 1 before and after comparison mean annual rainfall during the before fd period 2005 2008 1067 mm was greater than that for the after dwm period 2009 2014 958 mm although they were not statistically different 2 sample t test p 0 05 table 2 expressed as a fraction of annual precipitation measured discharge table 2 decreased from 28 during the fd period to 24 during the dwm period drainage discharge was observed on 205 days per year during the fd period compared to 262 days per year during the dwm period thus before and after comparison of measured data suggested that dwm reduced drainage discharge volume but increased the number of days with discharge the greater number of discharge days were likely a combination of greater rainfall during dwm years and reduced water storage capacity of soil due to a higher water table when the field was subjected to dwm a comparison of measured mean annual discharges during fd years versus dwm years indicates a 23 reduction due to dwm table 2 while comparison of mean annual simulated drainage during fd years versus dwm years predicted a 35 reduction however in contrast to measured data the reduction in simulated discharge was also accompanied by a decrease in the number of discharge days 172 to 136 under dwm table 2 other studies have suggested a likely increase in surface runoff due to implementation of dwm ross et al 2016 however less surface runoff was simulated during dwm years 39 mm compared to fd years 66 mm the proportion of simulated surface runoff compared to annual rainfall was also less during dwm years 4 compared to fd years 6 the reduction in annual runoff during dwm years table 2 may be attributed to the increase in annual et during these years mean daily simulated et in fd years 1 8 mm day 1 and dwm years 1 9 mm day 1 were not significantly different however when evaluating mean gs daily et between fd 2 8 mm day 1 and dwm 2 mm day 1 periods the difference was significant p 0 05 the increase in gs et was attributed to an increase in gs precipitation between the periods and slightly warmer temperatures 0 3 c that may have caused an increase in et and changed antecedent moisture conditions consequently resulting in increased infiltration with an associated decrease in surface runoff although seepage was simulated to be a small fraction of the total water budget the dwm years had greater seepage losses 12 mm than the fd years 8 mm the increase in seepage is a result of greater hydraulic gradient caused by a raised water table when the outlet is in dwm mode the average water table depth simulated during dwm years 1063 mm from surface was significantly greater than that during fd years 1147 mm from surface a simulation study by youssef et al 2018 for 48 sites across the midwestern u s showed an increase in et 5 or 27 mm yr 1 and vertical seepage 23 or 9 mm yr 1 under dwm compared to fd 3 1 2 2 paired field comparison estimated reductions from dwm implementation using the paired field approach ranged from 69 to 137 mm 57 to 31 with an average of 23 mm 9 3 tables 3 4 negative estimates of reductions occurred during the dry years of 2010 and 2012 and were likely caused by intermittent low flow events at only one of the outlets the regression model failed to predict flows at outlet b4 when no flow was observed at outlet b2 this may have resulted in lesser discharge estimates at b4 under fd compared to those observed under dwm williams et al 2015 used a similar approach to predict discharge from b4 during 2009 2012 assuming the absence of dwm and estimated a mean 23 69 mm reduction in drainage discharge the difference in the two estimates was attributed to the inclusion of 2 years of additional data in the current study used to develop linear regression equations between discharges from b2 and b4 3 1 2 3 simulated scenario based comparison differences in simulated drainage discharge between fd and dwm ranged from 2 7 to 14 8 during 2009 2014 with an average reduction of 8 3 19 mm table 3 in contrast to the before and after comparison of measured data the number of days with discharge was reduced from 167 in fd to 136 in dwm although the observed and simulated annual drainage discharges showed a linear response to annual rainfall the reduction in drainage outflow was not uniform across the range of annual precipitation for example precipitation totals for 2010 and 2013 were different by 277 mm yet each year was simulated to have a similar reduction in drainage discharge 14 and 14 8 respectively furthermore the reduction was estimated to be only 6 for the wettest year 2011 among the years with dwm surface runoff accounted for 16 of total outflow runoff plus drainage under dwm and about 10 during fd average annual surface runoff simulated under dwm was greater 39 mm than that under fd 26 mm suggesting a 49 increase table 3 although the percent increase in runoff simulated in the immediate study was greater than the percent reduction in drainage the magnitude of change in runoff was only a small fraction of the total water loss 13 mm out of 250 mm table 3 the average water table depth simulated under dwm 1063 mm from surface was significantly greater than that under the fd scenario 1171 mm from surface thus a higher water table and relatively wetter soil profile under dwm likely increased the loss of water through surface pathways in comparison ross et al 2016 summarized surface runoff volumes from 10 studies comparing dwm and fd while the data summarized for field studies suggested a 33 28 mm increase in surface runoff under dwm inclusion of modeling studies changed the estimate to a 154 60 mm increase a comprehensive modeling study by youssef et al 2018 for 48 sites across the midwestern u s showed a 123 or 48 mm increase in surface runoff from dwm compared to fd a similar increase in surface runoff was observed by drury et al 2009 1996 tan and zhang 2011 and tan et al 2002 in fields with dwm and sub irrigation treatments a common observation in dwm related studies is that the volumetric reduction in drainage outflow is translated into an increase in surface runoff ale et al 2009 evans et al 1995 gilliam and skaggs 1986 thus total discharge surface plus subsurface loss of water becomes an important indicator of the hydrologic effect of dwm the annual total water loss under dwm was reduced by an average of 2 5 6 mm the magnitude of reduction varied annually and ranged from 0 3 to 5 7 average annual et was 693 mm under fd compared to 697 mm under dwm suggesting an increase of about 4 mm or 0 6 furthermore average annual seepage loss from the field was estimated to be 9 mm under fd mode and 11 mm under dwm mode thus the increase in total losses through et plus seepage 6 mm was equivalent to the reduction in total loss through runoff and subsurface drainage therefore dwm reduced the total loss of water from the field attributable to increased et and seepage during the high water table periods in general the ranges and magnitudes of water budget components in the current study are similar to those summarized by ross et al 2016 youssef et al 2018 and liu et al 2019 the three analysis methods agree that dwm reduces drainage volume but differ in their estimates of the magnitude of reduction although increased surface runoff may negate a portion of the reduction in subsurface drainage dwm is still likely to reduce the net water loss through increased et and seepage during high water table conditions crop type magnitude and temporal distribution of rainfall and air temperatures may also affect the inter annual variation of reduction king et al 2016 ross et al 2016 3 2 nitrate loss 3 2 1 measured and simulated nitrate loss measured mean daily no3 n concentration calculated at the annual time scale was 10 1 mg l 1 range 4 3 24 5 mg l 1 and was comparable to the simulated mean daily concentration of 9 1 mg l 1 range 4 7 32 mg l 1 table 2 a large increase in 2009 concentrations was due to a one time poultry manure application and was captured in both measured and predicted values however the model failed to predict the gradual decrease that occurred in subsequent years williams et al 2015 estimated a greater mean annual concentration 16 9 mg l 1 from the same site but their calculations were based on only days with non zero flow and the duration of measurement was shorter than the current study 2006 to 2012 versus 2005 2014 both measured and simulated concentrations were comparable to those reported for similar rotations in illinois gentry et al 1998 9 15 mg l 1 and indiana kladivko et al 2004 7 31 mg l 1 measured annual no3 n loads ranged from 13 5 kg ha 1 2012 to 49 7 kg ha 1 2005 with an average of 32 4 kg ha 1 table 2 in general greater annual no3 n loads were measured in corn years compared to soybean years however in 2007 and 2008 when soybean was planted greater annual no3 n loads were measured and were most likely a response to a fall 2007 chicken litter application weekly no3 n loads were generally underestimated nse 0 28 r2 0 45 during calibration and validation periods however the model performance improved for monthly seasonal and annual predictions table 1 measured and simulated annual no3 n loads were consistent with those reported in other similar studies ale et al 2012 fausey et al 1995 the no3 n loads were consistently under predicted during the fd years but not during dwm years table 2 the stark difference in simulated and observed no3 n loads in 2010 may be attributed to suppressed crop yields due to the excessively dry year this suggests that a portion of available nitrogen was not utilized by the crop that year resulting in greater observed no3n losses table 2 drainmod nii was not able to capture this phenomenon most likely because measured yields and biomass were not collected or available for calibration seventy three percent of total annual no3 n loads 23 6 out of 32 4 kg ha 1 were observed to occur in the ngs a result of greater discharge volumes table 2 similar findings related to timing of no3 n loads were previously reported for the b4 field king et al 2016 2015a 3 2 2 effect of dwm on nitrate loss 3 2 2 1 before and after comparison the mean daily no3 n concentration during dwm years was significantly greater than that during fd years table 2 two sample t test p 0 05 furthermore the mean daily concentrations were significantly greater in most months of dwm years than those of fd years appendix 2 two sample t test p 0 05 this was unexpected since higher water tables associated with dwm generally promote anaerobic conditions and denitrification resulting in lesser concentrations when compared to fd the expected effects of dwm on no3 n concentration seem to have been masked due to elevated concentrations during these periods thus the increase in concentrations may be due to the combined effects of fertilizer application in 2009 and a large poultry litter application in fall of 2007 compared to the fd years mean annual no3 n loads after dwm implementation reduced by 8 4 kg ha 1 from 37 4 to 29 kg ha 1 table 4 suggesting a reduction of 22 5 however the reduction estimated from simulated data was much less 1 7 kg ha 1 or 6 despite the elevated concentrations during dwm years the lower no3 n loads during dwm years than those during fd years suggested that the load reduction under dwm was primarily due to the reduction in discharge while the results from the before and after comparison are consistent with findings from other studies fausey 2004 williams et al 2015 the temporal variability of factors such as weather and management operations may bias the estimate of dwm effectiveness a paired field comparison helps control for such temporal effects 3 2 2 2 paired field comparison the predicted concentrations at outlet b4 using the developed relationship between b2 and b4 2006 2008 r2 0 85 table 4 footnote suggested that mean daily no3 n concentration during 2009 2014 would be 11 9 mg l 1 under fd compared to 11 6 mg l 1 under dwm table 4 the concentrations were not significantly different in general the concentrations under dwm tended to be less than those in fd during ngs months and similar or slightly greater during gs months when both outlets were in fd mode thus the effect of dwm on mean concentrations may be negligible as the slight decrease in concentrations during the ngs is balanced by a slight increase in concentrations during the gs similar findings using paired field assessments of dwm have been reported by williams et al 2015 and ross et al 2016 the paired field approach indicated that dwm significantly reduced annual no3 n load by 25 3 or 10 3 kg ha 1 table 3 however in dry years 2010 and 2012 an increase in no3 n load was measured the mean daily no3 n loads during the fd period 0 11 kg ha 1 were greater than loads in the dwm period 0 08 kg ha 1 table 3 using a similar paired field approach williams et al 2015 estimated a 21 reduction in no3 n load at the same site the estimated load reduction using the paired field approach was similar to that from the before and after comparison table 4 however the paired field approach provides further insights into inter annual variability of dwm effectiveness for example a closer look at annual estimated discharge and load reductions table 3 suggests that even a small discharge reduction 9 under dwm may lead to a greater percent reduction in nitrate load 25 3 2 2 3 simulated scenario based comparison no significant differences in mean daily no3 n concentrations were noted between the simulated fd 10 8 mg l 1 and dwm 10 9 mg l 1 scenarios during 2009 2014 table 2 table 4 similar trends were present in mean daily concentrations at monthly time scales fig 3 a in general ngs mean concentrations were lesser under dwm than under fd while the gs mean concentrations were similar between dwm and fd scenarios despite the effects of dwm on no3 n concentrations in the ngs months dwm did not have a significant impact on mean daily no3 n concentrations at annual scales similar findings regarding no differences in no3 n concentrations have been reported by williams et al 2015 fausey 2004 wesstr√∂m et al 2001 and lavaire et al 2017 conversely other studies suggest that dwm reduces no3 n concentrations in drainage water by promoting denitrification adeuya et al 2012 fausey 2005 lalonde et al 1996 liu et al 2019 ng et al 2002 while still others report increases in no3 n concentrations under dwm poole et al 2018 the simulated mean annual no3 n loads under fd and dwm were 29 5 and 26 8 kg ha 1 respectively and the differences between fd and dwm loads were statistically significant p 0 05 table 3 unlike the paired field approach a reduction in no3 n loads under dwm was present even in the dry years of 2010 and 2012 table 3 overall the simulated scenarios suggest that dwm reduced mean annual no3 n loads by 2 8 kg ha 1 or 9 3 table 4 the average monthly no3 n loads were consistently greater under fd than under dwm however the differences were non significant p 0 05 fig 3b the magnitude of reductions in simulated no3 n loads 2 3 13 7 under dwm in the current study was less than that reported in other simulation studies e g 45 by ross et al 2016 32 by youssef et al 2018 or paired field studies e g 21 by williams et al 2015 45 by fausey 2004 26 35 by skaggs et al 2012a 51 79 by cooke and verma 2012 the three methods discussed above differ in magnitudes of estimated no3 n load reduction ranging from 2 8 to 10 3 kg ha 1 the paired field and simulated scenario based comparisons suggest that the ngs no3 n concentrations tend to be lesser under dwm than fd specifically during the periods when the outlet is in dwm mode however the differences in no3 n concentrations are significant across only a few months of the ngs these results suggest that dwm reduced the loss of no3 n primarily through reduction of discharge rather than denitrification thus reductions in no3 n loads are expected to follow trends similar to those in drainage discharge volume fausey 2005 ross et al 2016 for example the greatest reductions in both discharge and no3 n loads were estimated for 2013 which was also the wettest year however similar reductions in no3 n loads 13 4 were simulated for 2014 with only a 2 7 reduction in drainage discharge thus the benefit of dwm in terms of no3 n load reduction varies temporally and may not be attributed solely to the reduction in drainage outflows or concentrations additional factors such as weather crop type fertilizer management and organic matter dynamics likely play a role in nitrogen dynamics even under dwm king et al 2016 ross et al 2016 3 3 uncertainty in estimating effects of dwm the estimated effects of dwm using the three approaches ranged from reductions of 8 23 for discharge 1 to 2 5 for no3 n concentrations and 9 25 for no3 n loads table 4 most studies utilize one approach and so understanding the uncertainty associated with a given approach is essential uncertainty in the before and after approach is introduced from uncontrolled factors such as the interannual variability of climatic parameters the paired field design overcomes this limitation by pairing the treatment field with a control field however uncertainty with the paired field method arises when the underlying assumptions of the statistical design are violated for example if the control field response changes between control and treatment periods clausen and spooner 1993 shedekar et al 2017 outlets b2 and b4 drain adjacent parts of the same large field and are hydraulically connected most of the area drained by b4 is at a higher elevation compared to that drained by b2 fig 1 thus implementing dwm in b4 may have influenced the hydrologic response of b2 affecting the relationship between outlet discharges during dwm years using the pre dwm linear relationship in such a scenario may lead to over prediction of outflows from b4 for a system under fd and result in over prediction of discharge reduction under dwm thus a paired field comparison in such scenarios may over estimate the dwm effectiveness in terms of discharge as well as n loads shedekar et al 2017 with respect to the simulation approach the source of uncertainty is in model parameterization and assumptions for example drainmod nii assumes a relatively flat field with uniform water table across the entire field due to the set weir depth however for a large field with gentle slope the actual zone of influence area with high water table due to dwm may be smaller than expected leading to erroneous simulated results shedekar et al 2017 furthermore presence of a drainage channel within 30 to 100 m of the field may significantly affect the water table and drainage discharge fipps and skaggs 1986 such scenarios potentially affect model outcomes and should be considered during the model parameterization process while many studies report reductions in drainage discharge few studies evaluate the associated increase in surface runoff and seepage losses if an increase in the surface or subsurface pathways is substantial a perceived reduction in drainage discharge may need to be re evaluated large scale assessments of dwm typically rely on evidence from observational or modeling studies the reported magnitudes of dwm effectiveness tend to be averages across the study periods and or study sites furthermore it is important to recognize that dwm effectiveness is not consistent across years sites and management the high spatio temporal variability of dwm effectiveness is evident even in replicated plot studies saadat et al 2018 with several factors affecting water budget and water quality under dwm using a single assessment approach may lead to biased estimates of its effectiveness for example thorp et al 2008 used rzwqm dssat at 48 locations across the us midwest and estimated that dwm could reduce nitrate losses by 7 1 to 49 6 kg ha 1 yr 1 33 60 compared to fd jaynes et al 2010 extrapolated the results of thorp et al 2008 across the mississippi river basin and estimated that dwm would reduce no3 n losses to surface waters by 83 million kg yr 1 they concluded that dwm would have potential to meet 6 of the desired 45 reduction goal set forth by the hypoxia task force for the gulf of mexico mississippi river gulf of mexico watershed nutrient task force 2008 such studies however fail to recognize the uncertainty associated with the field scale assessments that propagates into large scale estimates implementing dwm in isolated pockets or fields over large areas may simply reroute the flow pathways to adjacent un managed fields and ditches through lateral seepage and runoff further reducing the practice s effectiveness thus understanding the methods and uncertainty associated with quantifying the effectiveness of dwm is essential in assessing large scale dwm adoption an average value or a range of values to represent annual performance of dwm may still be inadequate for scaling up dwm effectiveness across sites instead of using a single value or a range of values that remain static across years and sites a probabilistic approach that accounts for the stochasticity of the practice effectiveness across time and scales may be more appropriate for assessing dwm impacts to facilitate adoption of such new approaches large datasets that combine multiple short and long term monitoring and modeling studies at regional scales may be essential in near future to increase the confidence in dwm performance assessment the future dwm research shall focus on tracking the complete water and nutrient budgets within and across field boundaries 4 summary and conclusions this study used multiple methods and evaluated water budget components other than drainage or runoff to better understand the range of dwm effectiveness three approaches before and after comparison paired field comparison and simulated scenario based comparison were used to estimate the effectiveness of dwm at the outlet of a systematically drained agricultural field in central ohio based on the three assessment approaches we find that dwm reduced annual drainage discharge by 8 to 23 19 to 69 mm increased surface runoff by 50 but accounted for only 3 to 4 of annual precipitation 13 mm reduced total water loss surface runoff plus subsurface drainage by an average of 2 5 attributable to increased losses through et and seepage 6 mm decreased the number of days having subsurface drainage while increasing the number of days having surface runoff decreased mean no3 n concentrations by 1 to 2 5 on annual basis with a reduction of up to 10 in the non growing season decreased no3 n loads in subsurface drainage discharge by 9 to 25 2 8 to 10 3 kg ha 1 yr 1 these findings suggest that although increased surface runoff may negate a portion of the reduction in subsurface drainage dwm is still likely to reduce the net water loss through increased et and seepage during high water table conditions although the observed and simulated data show a likely reduction in drainage and no3 n loads under dwm the true benefit of dwm remains uncertain in fields prone to seepage and runoff losses as well as those where the zone of influence is significantly less than the total contributing area therefore a strategic adoption of dwm across contiguous landscapes and drainage networks may be essential for maximizing the benefits of the practice furthermore implementing dwm in a paired field that is adjacent to the control field or a drainage ditch may considerably affect hydraulic gradients as well as water and nutrient balances leading to under or over estimation of dwm effectiveness using a combined assessment approach may help address the uncertainty and bias associated with estimating dwm effectiveness at watershed and regional scales thus understanding the method used to assess the effectiveness of dwm as well as the uncertainty associated with that method is essential for realizing the true potential of the

10437,considering the future rapid economic development and large population growth xiong an new area known as a lake marsh wetland has been undergoing rapid urbanization especially under the background of the xiong an new area project which has caused considerable regional climate changes in local area and has proven to be a research focus for studying various problems aspects in the process of urbanization in the new era both lake marsh wetlands and urbanization have a significant impact on the local climate and they also interact with each other however few studies focus on simulating and analyzing the interaction mentioned above in this paper we use the weather research and forecasting wrf model to quantitatively analyze the effects of urbanization on regionals climate in lake marsh wetland area to depict the process of urbanization and differences changes in temperature and precipitation induced by urbanization five scenarios were set up including 1980 2000 2015 design and urban scenarios the results suggest that i urbanization surrounding the lake marsh wetland increases local precipitation the precipitation center is concentrated in the lake area and its surrounding area and baiyangdian lake has a great influence on precipitation ii urbanization slightly increases the local temperature the design and urban temperatures increased by 0 063 and 0 104 compared with the 1980 temperatures the design scenarios have the highest temperature in the southeast the lowest temperature in the central lake area and the overall spatial distribution of temperature decreases from southeast to northwest iii in during the urbanization process of xiong an new area the increase of rainstorm precipitation is more significant which increases the potential risk of urban flood and indicates a much more urgent practical need for the construction standard of local drainage pipeline network iv the temperature in near the lake area is lower which has played a cooling role the temperature difference between the inside and outside of the lake is about 1 there are different responses to temperature and precipitation inside and outside the lake area in the same established urbanization process precipitation inside the lake area varies greatly under the influence of urbanization while the temperature increases slightly keywords wrf xiong an new area urbanization lake marsh wetland regional climate baiyangdian lake 1 introduction rapid development of economy plus explosive population growth unceasingly speeds up the progress of urbanization shimadera et al 2015 yang et al 2014 by which climate change caused has become a widespread concern accordingly su et al 2019 trenberth 2011 especially the urbanization occurred in a lake marsh wetland or around a lake will result in significant difference form others with the expansion of urban land and the increase of urban buildings the urban underlying surface properties e g surface roughness surface heat capacity albedo and vegetation coverage have been greatly changed which not only changes the original climate physical process such as surface energy balance and hydrological cycle process such as the distribution of precipitation but also produces new dynamic and thermal processes such as urban heat storage canyon effect of buildings and the increase of human heat all the changes caused by urbanization discussed above can be concluded into the five island effect xiao ying 2012 that is the impact of urban heat island rizwan et al 2008 dixon and mote 2003 urban wet island urban dry island urban rain island and urban turbid island where the temperature and precipitation are most closely related to environment ecosystem and human daily life for the safety and better development of a city it is necessary to predict the impact of urbanization in advance and grasp the laws of hydrology and climate affected by urbanization in time many works related to the evaluation of the urbanization effects on regional climate focused on the qualitative analysis based on observational data kaufmann et al 2007 changnon 2016 for example bornstein and qinglu 2000 analyzed data from a surface meteorological network around atlanta to show that the urban heat island uhi effect induced a convergence zone that initiated storms during the summer of 1996 however it cannot satisfy the need of urban planning just by observational data han et al 2014 in this paper we choose the weather research and forecasting wrf model to simulate and analyze the effect of urbanization on regional climate which is a next generation mesoscale numerical weather prediction system designed for both atmospheric research and operational forecasting applications and serves a wide range of meteorological applications across scales wrf model has been successfully used on the aspect of precipitation simulation all over the world hamill et al hamill 2014 conducted a simulation of a heavy rainfall process in colorado area in the united states using wrf their results showed that wrf model could better simulate the process and spatial distribution of a rainfall and also helped analyze the cause of the formation of the rainfall evans et al evans et al 2012 simulated a rainfall process in southeast australia using wrf model the results showed the simulation of precipitation process could be realized under different physical parameter combination schemes where only simulation effects were different kryza et al 2013 used wrf to simulate precipitation in southwest poland for a long period of time the results show that wrf can reproduce the precipitation process in this period better especially when the precipitation intensity is low a case study conducted by shepherd et al shepherd et al 2010 indicated that simulations without urban produced less cumulative rainfall in the area to the northwest of houston than simulations with the urban represented the studies cited above demonstrated that wrf model has a solid application foundation on the aspect of precipitation simulation while using the model to simulate the urbanization effects on regional climate was not that popular not to mention using more than two scenarios to conduct simulations on the effects of urbanization besides most of previous studies have focused merely on the relationship between urbanization and regional climate ignoring the interference of background the urbanization effects in a specific context such as the urbanization effects on regional climate around the lake marsh wetland is rarely discussed which plays important role in regional climate in our research we find lake marsh wetland can play a very good role in regional regulation and weaken the adverse effects in the process of urbanization especially on the aspects of temperature and precipitation which can provide new ideas for better urban planning in the future around the baiyangdian lake marsh wetland xiong an new area project was approved as a national level new area by the china state council in 2017 and since then the project was under construction it means another considerable potential urbanization surrounding the baiyangdian lake marsh wetland in future as a function of the non capitalization of beijing xiong an new area will be built into a super level modern city and become an important pole of the world class jing jin ji short for beijing tianjin and hebei economic belt in order to get better and more reasonable simulation results we designed and modeled five scenarios in wrf model including 1980 2000 2015 design 2030 and urban scenarios to simulate the urbanization effects on regional climate in xion an new area which is a typical lake marsh wetland to initial the background and period of the simulation we chose the period of simulation from june 7 2000 to september 22 2000 by comparing the simulations of the five scenarios the differences in temperature and precipitation and the differences between in lake and out of lake the urbanization effects were more convincingly quantified the results could not only help to deliver some recommendations on urban construction policy programs in local wetlands for relevant departments and researchers but could also provide a reference for the urbanization of similar wetland systems in other regions and even other developing countries 2 study area and method 2 1 study area and case design the study area is located in downstream of the daqing river basin in the north china plain fig 1 it is a warm temperate semi humid continental monsoon climate zone with four distinct seasons the taihang mountains in the northwest and the bohai sea in the east the average annual precipitation is 529 7 mm the average temperature is 12 2 c and the extreme maximum temperature is 40 7 c the minimum temperature is 26 7 c the total landform of baiyangdian is slightly inclined from northwest to southeast the terrain is flat the slope of the ground is 1 2000 the highest elevation in the western half is 10 m and the lowest elevation in the eastern half is 5 5 m fig 2 baiyangdian lake is located in the hinterland of beijing tianjin and baoding away from them are 105 km 105 km and 30 km respectively around baiyangdian lake the planning scope of the new area includes the administrative jurisdictions of xiong county rongcheng county and anxin county with a planned total area of approximately 2000 square kilometers 2 2 wrf model and case design 1 wrf model the wrf model embodies a new generation of mesoscale numerical model its developers include the national center for atmospheric research usa ncar the national oceanic and atmospheric administration usa noaa the national centers for environmental prediction usa ncep the forecast systems laboratory fsl and other collaborators kalnay et al 1996 the wrf incorporates advantages of the penn state ncar fifth generation mesoscale model mm5 and improves the disadvantages of mm5 model it is more suitable for mesoscale weather simulation and prediction http www wrf model org index php 2 parameter scheme the parameters scheme of wrf model adopted in the experiments is shown as table 1 in this study the wrf model was configured with two one way nests offline without feedback of 12 12 km d2 and 3 3 km d1 with a centre at 116 05 38 e 38 38 00 n the horizontal resolution of national centers for environmental prediction final ncep fnl operational global analysis data driven by wrf model is 1 1 for the setting of outer grid d1 we cover the whole research area and consider the influence of the weather system around the research area therefore the d1 designed in this paper covers the core lake area of baiyangdian lake and the whole xiong an new area in which the lake area accounts for about a quarter of the total d1 for the setting of outer grid d2 the influence of external boundary environment surrounding terrain environment and underlying surface should be considered for example the designed scope of d2 includes not only the taihang mountains but also the bohai sea as well as the major cities of beijing tianjin and hebei the simulation period extended from june 7 to september 22 2000 this is due to the concentration of precipitation during this period which accounts for 70 of the annual precipitation in addition the time integration step of the mode is set to 6 s and the time interval of output data is 1 h the model atmosphere includes 40 vertical layers extending from the surface to top layer whose atmospheric pressure is 50 hpa the lambert projection is selected for its better applicability in midlatitude area different physical parameterization schemes in wrf model can achieve different simulation results for different regions and rainfalls knievel et al 2004 chambon et al 2014 the main physical parameterization schemes involved in the model are cloud microphysical parameterization scheme cumulus convection parameterization scheme planetary boundary layer scheme land surface model and radiation scheme among these schemes the land surface model and radiation scheme mainly affect the energy propagation and the sensitivity of rainfall simulation to these two schemes is not high the cumulus convection parameterization scheme cloud microphysics parameterization scheme and planetary boundary layer scheme have the greatest impact on rainfall in the selection of parameterization schemes in this paper the cloud microphysics parameterization scheme chooses lin eltahan and magooda 2017 cumulus convection parameterization scheme chooses kf kain 2004 planetary boundary layer scheme chooses ysu hong et al 2006 to depict the process of urbanization five scenarios were set up namely 1980 2000 2015 design 2030 and urban scenarios in these five scenarios only the underlying surface input are different and other input data and parameterization schemes are consistent in order to select the climate background year which is less affected by human activities as the simulation background as far as possible and considering the starting time of fnl data the year 2000 was chosen moreover we choose the summer as the research therefore the period of simulation is from june 7 2000 to september 22 2000 input land use and land cover of 1980 2000 and 2015 scenarios are derived from remote sensing interpretation data provided by the chinese academy of sciences input land use and land cover of design scenario is simplified design according to the planning scheme of xiong an new area and the urban scenario is that the whole d1 research area is surrounded by all the cities except the lake area which is discussed as an extreme case input land use and land cover of five cases for d1 is shown in fig 3 2 3 evaluation index to verify the effect of the model we use percentage bias pb and root mean square error rmse to analyze the long time series data they are calculated as follows 1 where pb is the percentage bias between observed and simulated value sim is value simulated by wrf model obs is the observation data of gauge station 2 where rmse is root mean square error sj and oj are the wrf simulation values and situ observations on day j respectively 3 result 3 1 model validation to verify the simulation effect of wrf model the wrf simulation results with the observation values of precipitation and temperature on june 7 2000 to september 22 2000 of hydrometeorological station in the basin and chooses pb and rmse as the evaluation indexes the daily averaged observations were provided by the national climate center of the china meteorological administration http www nmic gov cn the results are shown as figs 4 and 5 compared with the observed temperature the rmse of wrf simulations is only 2 4 and the pb is 7 04 this shows that the temperature simulation effect of wrf is very good and the trend of change is basically consistent with the actual temperature compared with the observed precipitation the pb of wrf simulations is only 1 98 which shows that wrf basically simulates the actual precipitation process well however the rmse of simulated rainfall is 11 4 which is relatively larger it may be due to the uneven distribution of precipitation in northern china and the inaccuracy of some heavy rainfall simulation such as the simulated precipitation in august there are some cases where the peak value of daily precipitation is significantly smaller than that of obs therefore the wrf model and parameterization scheme selected in this paper accurately simulate the temperature and precipitation process in xiong an new area 3 2 impacts of precipitation to study the impact of urbanization on precipitation in xiongan new area this paper simulates the changes of precipitation in the whole basin and corresponding lake areas in five different scenarios from june 7 to september 22 the results are shown in table 2 and fig 6 the cumulative precipitation distribution under five different underlying surface conditions is shown in turn fig 6 the results show that 1 the precipitation distribution in baiyangdian lake region is very uneven and the maximum difference of accumulated precipitation in different locations and periods in the region is 600 mm 2 the precipitation center is concentrated in the lake area and its surrounding area followed by the northwest and the southeast which shows that baiyangdian lake has a great influence on precipitation 3 from scenarios of 1980 2000 2015 desin and ubran the total cumulative precipitation increases gradually which indicates that the environment around baiyangdian lake increases the precipitation in the lake area due to urbanization table 3 the statistical cumulative precipitation in the lake are shown in table 2 table 2 shows that the precipitation increment in the lake area is significantly larger than that outside the lake which is about 260 mm moreover urbanization is more sensitive to precipitation in the lake area and the increase is greater regardless of the lake area or the whole river basin with the increase of urban underlying surface area the rainfall shows an increasing trend especially for baiyangdian lake area the increase of precipitation is more obvious compared with the 1980 scenario the rainfall in urban scenario increased from 367 51 mm to 383 21 mm with an increase of 15 7 mm rainfall in the lake area increased more from 619 61 mm to 666 39 mm and the rainfall increased by 46 78 mm this may be due to the poor permeability of urban underlying the rainfall cannot infiltrate into the ground after falling to the ground only in the form of evaporation in the upper air with the movement of air forming a new round of precipitation for the lake area this effect is more intense because of the increase of air humidity caused by regional evaporation more water is accumulated over the central lake area and it is easier to form a large rainfall process fig 7 shows the difference of cumulative process lines for precipitation in five scenarios it also shows the urbanization process increased the precipitation although the change of precipitation is not obvious in the diurnal scale the cumulative rainfall of different underlying surface scenarios increases after a heavy rain furthermore the effects of urbanization on different rainfall patterns during the simulation period are analyzed fig 8 shows the difference of precipitation light rain moderate rain heavy rain rainstorm between the scenario of 1980 and other four scenarios the results show that with the urbanization process of underlying surface the increase of heavy rain and heavy rain is the most significant especially in the urban scenario in contrast the effect of urbanization on precipitation enhancement of moderate or light rain is not obvious because urbanization is the effect of increasing rainfall in xiongan new area and the increase of rainstorm is more significant which undoubtedly increases the risk of urban flood so attention should be paid to the construction of drainage network 3 3 impacts of temperature to study the impact of urbanization on temperature in xiongan new area this paper simulates the changes of temperature in the whole basin and corresponding lake areas in five different scenarios from june 7 to september 22 the results are shown in figs 9 and 10 fig 9 shows the cumulative precipitation distribution under five different underlying surface conditions one by one as can be seen from the figure 1 the temperature in the southeastern part of the simulation area is the highest while that in the central lake area is the lowest and the overall temperature spatial distribution decreases from southeast to northwest 2 the temperature in the lake area is low and the temperature difference between the inside and outside of the lake is about 1 3 urbanization process from scenarios of 1980 2000 2015 desin and ubran the temperature is gradually increasing which indicates that the environment around baiyangdian lake and urbanization increase the temperature of the region the design and urban temperatures increase by 0 063 and 0 104 degrees in comparison with the 1980 temperatures 3 4 discussion taking xiongan new area under construction as an example this paper studies the impact of urbanization on precipitation and temperature in this area wrf simulation results suggest that urbanization around the baiyangdian lake plays an important role in precipitation and temperature variation the results show that the construction of xiongan new area has increased the local temperature and precipitation this indicates that urbanization around the lake area may cause rain island effect and heat island effect due to the existence of lakes urbanization has formed the rain island effect which is in sharp contrast with other places in addition due to the influence of lakes the effect of urbanization is less than that of other areas which shows that the existence of lakes is conducive to alleviating the increase of temperature in addition the urbanization process of xiongan new area has obvious impact on the increase of rainstorm precipitation which increases the potential risk of urban flood control warning and the construction standard of local drainage pipeline network should be improved moreover it should be pointed out that the underlying surface as for cities near lakes replaced by this study is the traditional urban underlying surface the traditional urban underlying surface will reduce groundwater infiltration however with the construction of sponge city and the rational optimization of urban layout the actual impact of urbanization on climate may be milder than the changes predicted in this paper in the past 20 years the area of baiyangdian lake has declined to some extent mainly due to the decrease of precipitation in the basin since 2000 and the transitional exploitation of groundwater with the development of urbanization buildings and roads built along the lake may affect groundwater infiltration resulting in the reduction of water resources in the lake area which may underestimate the prediction of urbanization on the rise of temperature 4 conclusion the wrf model was used to simulate the effects of urbanization on regional temperature and precipitation using five scenarios in xion an new area the following main conclusions were obtained 1 urbanization increases local precipitation compared with the 1980 scenario the urban scenario increased by 15 7 mm the lake area increased by more and the rainfall increased by 46 78 mm the precipitation center is concentrated in the lake area and its surrounding area and baiyangdian lake has a great influence on precipitation 2 urbanization slightly increased the local temperature the design and urban temperatures increased by 0 063 and 0 104 c compared with the 1980 temperatures the design scenarios had the highest temperature in the southeast the lowest temperature in the central lake area and the overall temperature spatial distribution decreased from southeast to northwest 3 in the urbanization process of xiongan new area the increase of rainstorm precipitation is more significant which increases the potential risk of urban flood and the construction standard of local drainage pipeline network should be improved 4 the temperature of the lake area is low which has played a cooling role the temperature difference between the inside and outside of the lake is about 1 c 5 there are different responses to temperature and precipitation inside and outside the lake area the precipitation inside the lake area varies greatly under the influence of urbanization while the temperature increases slightly declaration of competing interest the authors reported no declarations of interest acknowledgements this study received

generation mesoscale model mm5 and improves the disadvantages of mm5 model it is more suitable for mesoscale weather simulation and prediction http www wrf model org index php 2 parameter scheme the parameters scheme of wrf model adopted in the experiments is shown as table 1 in this study the wrf model was configured with two one way nests offline without feedback of 12 12 km d2 and 3 3 km d1 with a centre at 116 05 38 e 38 38 00 n the horizontal resolution of national centers for environmental prediction final ncep fnl operational global analysis data driven by wrf model is 1 1 for the setting of outer grid d1 we cover the whole research area and consider the influence of the weather system around the research area therefore the d1 designed in this paper covers the core lake area of baiyangdian lake and the whole xiong an new area in which the lake area accounts for about a quarter of the total d1 for the setting of outer grid d2 the influence of external boundary environment surrounding terrain environment and underlying surface should be considered for example the designed scope of d2 includes not only the taihang mountains but also the bohai sea as well as the major cities of beijing tianjin and hebei the simulation period extended from june 7 to september 22 2000 this is due to the concentration of precipitation during this period which accounts for 70 of the annual precipitation in addition the time integration step of the mode is set to 6 s and the time interval of output data is 1 h the model atmosphere includes 40 vertical layers extending from the surface to top layer whose atmospheric pressure is 50 hpa the lambert projection is selected for its better applicability in midlatitude area different physical parameterization schemes in wrf model can achieve different simulation results for different regions and rainfalls knievel et al 2004 chambon et al 2014 the main physical parameterization schemes involved in the model are cloud microphysical parameterization scheme cumulus convection parameterization scheme planetary boundary layer scheme land surface model and radiation scheme among these schemes the land surface model and radiation scheme mainly affect the energy propagation and the sensitivity of rainfall simulation to these two schemes is not high the cumulus convection parameterization scheme cloud microphysics parameterization scheme and planetary boundary layer scheme have the greatest impact on rainfall in the selection of parameterization schemes in this paper the cloud microphysics parameterization scheme chooses lin eltahan and magooda 2017 cumulus convection parameterization scheme chooses kf kain 2004 planetary boundary layer scheme chooses ysu hong et al 2006 to depict the process of urbanization five scenarios were set up namely 1980 2000 2015 design 2030 and urban scenarios in these five scenarios only the underlying surface input are different and other input data and parameterization schemes are consistent in order to select the climate background year which is less affected by human activities as the simulation background as far as possible and considering the starting time of fnl data the year 2000 was chosen moreover we choose the summer as the research therefore the period of simulation is from june 7 2000 to september 22 2000 input land use and land cover of 1980 2000 and 2015 scenarios are derived from remote sensing interpretation data provided by the chinese academy of sciences input land use and land cover of design scenario is simplified design according to the planning scheme of xiong an new area and the urban scenario is that the whole d1 research area is surrounded by all the cities except the lake area which is discussed as an extreme case input land use and land cover of five cases for d1 is shown in fig 3 2 3 evaluation index to verify the effect of the model we use percentage bias pb and root mean square error rmse to analyze the long time series data they are calculated as follows 1 where pb is the percentage bias between observed and simulated value sim is value simulated by wrf model obs is the observation data of gauge station 2 where rmse is root mean square error sj and oj are the wrf simulation values and situ observations on day j respectively 3 result 3 1 model validation to verify the simulation effect of wrf model the wrf simulation results with the observation values of precipitation and temperature on june 7 2000 to september 22 2000 of hydrometeorological station in the basin and chooses pb and rmse as the evaluation indexes the daily averaged observations were provided by the national climate center of the china meteorological administration http www nmic gov cn the results are shown as figs 4 and 5 compared with the observed temperature the rmse of wrf simulations is only 2 4 and the pb is 7 04 this shows that the temperature simulation effect of wrf is very good and the trend of change is basically consistent with the actual temperature compared with the observed precipitation the pb of wrf simulations is only 1 98 which shows that wrf basically simulates the actual precipitation process well however the rmse of simulated rainfall is 11 4 which is relatively larger it may be due to the uneven distribution of precipitation in northern china and the inaccuracy of some heavy rainfall simulation such as the simulated precipitation in august there are some cases where the peak value of daily precipitation is significantly smaller than that of obs therefore the wrf model and parameterization scheme selected in this paper accurately simulate the temperature and precipitation process in xiong an new area 3 2 impacts of precipitation to study the impact of urbanization on precipitation in xiongan new area this paper simulates the changes of precipitation in the whole basin and corresponding lake areas in five different scenarios from june 7 to september 22 the results are shown in table 2 and fig 6 the cumulative precipitation distribution under five different underlying surface conditions is shown in turn fig 6 the results show that 1 the precipitation distribution in baiyangdian lake region is very uneven and the maximum difference of accumulated precipitation in different locations and periods in the region is 600 mm 2 the precipitation center is concentrated in the lake area and its surrounding area followed by the northwest and the southeast which shows that baiyangdian lake has a great influence on precipitation 3 from scenarios of 1980 2000 2015 desin and ubran the total cumulative precipitation increases gradually which indicates that the environment around baiyangdian lake increases the precipitation in the lake area due to urbanization table 3 the statistical cumulative precipitation in the lake are shown in table 2 table 2 shows that the precipitation increment in the lake area is significantly larger than that outside the lake which is about 260 mm moreover urbanization is more sensitive to precipitation in the lake area and the increase is greater regardless of the lake area or the whole river basin with the increase of urban underlying surface area the rainfall shows an increasing trend especially for baiyangdian lake area the increase of precipitation is more obvious compared with the 1980 scenario the rainfall in urban scenario increased from 367 51 mm to 383 21 mm with an increase of 15 7 mm rainfall in the lake area increased more from 619 61 mm to 666 39 mm and the rainfall increased by 46 78 mm this may be due to the poor permeability of urban underlying the rainfall cannot infiltrate into the ground after falling to the ground only in the form of evaporation in the upper air with the movement of air forming a new round of precipitation for the lake area this effect is more intense because of the increase of air humidity caused by regional evaporation more water is accumulated over the central lake area and it is easier to form a large rainfall process fig 7 shows the difference of cumulative process lines for precipitation in five scenarios it also shows the urbanization process increased the precipitation although the change of precipitation is not obvious in the diurnal scale the cumulative rainfall of different underlying surface scenarios increases after a heavy rain furthermore the effects of urbanization on different rainfall patterns during the simulation period are analyzed fig 8 shows the difference of precipitation light rain moderate rain heavy rain rainstorm between the scenario of 1980 and other four scenarios the results show that with the urbanization process of underlying surface the increase of heavy rain and heavy rain is the most significant especially in the urban scenario in contrast the effect of urbanization on precipitation enhancement of moderate or light rain is not obvious because urbanization is the effect of increasing rainfall in xiongan new area and the increase of rainstorm is more significant which undoubtedly increases the risk of urban flood so attention should be paid to the construction of drainage network 3 3 impacts of temperature to study the impact of urbanization on temperature in xiongan new area this paper simulates the changes of temperature in the whole basin and corresponding lake areas in five different scenarios from june 7 to september 22 the results are shown in figs 9 and 10 fig 9 shows the cumulative precipitation distribution under five different underlying surface conditions one by one as can be seen from the figure 1 the temperature in the southeastern part of the simulation area is the highest while that in the central lake area is the lowest and the overall temperature spatial distribution decreases from southeast to northwest 2 the temperature in the lake area is low and the temperature difference between the inside and outside of the lake is about 1 3 urbanization process from scenarios of 1980 2000 2015 desin and ubran the temperature is gradually increasing which indicates that the environment around baiyangdian lake and urbanization increase the temperature of the region the design and urban temperatures increase by 0 063 and 0 104 degrees in comparison with the 1980 temperatures 3 4 discussion taking xiongan new area under construction as an example this paper studies the impact of urbanization on precipitation and temperature in this area wrf simulation results suggest that urbanization around the baiyangdian lake plays an important role in precipitation and temperature variation the results show that the construction of xiongan new area has increased the local temperature and precipitation this indicates that urbanization around the lake area may cause rain island effect and heat island effect due to the existence of lakes urbanization has formed the rain island effect which is in sharp contrast with other places in addition due to the influence of lakes the effect of urbanization is less than that of other areas which shows that the existence of lakes is conducive to alleviating the increase of temperature in addition the urbanization process of xiongan new area has obvious impact on the increase of rainstorm precipitation which increases the potential risk of urban flood control warning and the construction standard of local drainage pipeline network should be improved moreover it should be pointed out that the underlying surface as for cities near lakes replaced by this study is the traditional urban underlying surface the traditional urban underlying surface will reduce groundwater infiltration however with the construction of sponge city and the rational optimization of urban layout the actual impact of urbanization on climate may be milder than the changes predicted in this paper in the past 20 years the area of baiyangdian lake has declined to some extent mainly due to the decrease of precipitation in the basin since 2000 and the transitional exploitation of groundwater with the development of urbanization buildings and roads built along the lake may affect groundwater infiltration resulting in the reduction of water resources in the lake area which may underestimate the prediction of urbanization on the rise of temperature 4 conclusion the wrf model was used to simulate the effects of urbanization on regional temperature and precipitation using five scenarios in xion an new area the following main conclusions were obtained 1 urbanization increases local precipitation compared with the 1980 scenario the urban scenario increased by 15 7 mm the lake area increased by more and the rainfall increased by 46 78 mm the precipitation center is concentrated in the lake area and its surrounding area and baiyangdian lake has a great influence on precipitation 2 urbanization slightly increased the local temperature the design and urban temperatures increased by 0 063 and 0 104 c compared with the 1980 temperatures the design scenarios had the highest temperature in the southeast the lowest temperature in the central lake area and the overall temperature spatial distribution decreased from southeast to northwest 3 in the urbanization process of xiongan new area the increase of rainstorm precipitation is more significant which increases the potential risk of urban flood and the construction standard of local drainage pipeline network should be improved 4 the temperature of the lake area is low which has played a cooling role the temperature difference between the inside and outside of the lake is about 1 c 5 there are different responses to temperature and precipitation inside and outside the lake area the precipitation inside the lake area varies greatly under the influence of urbanization while the temperature increases slightly declaration of competing interest the authors reported no declarations of interest acknowledgements this study received

10438,ensuring fruit productivity and mitigation climate change under low consumption of fertilizer and irrigation can contribute to sustainable agriculture the objective of this study was to determine whether higher fruit production and lower net global warming potential net gwp could be realized concomitantly by reducing the amount of fertilizer and water applied the effect of water and fertilizer management on fruit yield n2o and ch4 emissions variation was measured over a two year period to gain insight into net gwp and greenhouse gas intensity ghgi in wine grape vineyard wgv and table grape vineyard tgv in north china two fertilizer and water managements were set in each vineyard optimized practice op treatment and traditional practice tp treatment the results showed that the op treatment significantly p 0 05 increased grape fruit by 10 2 and 10 7 in wgv and tgv respectively in comparison with tp treatment besides the fluxes n2o and ch4 showed significant seasonal variation and the maximum were occurred from april to september and the n2o emissions were strongly decreased in op treatment compared with the tp treatment the op treatment significantly p 0 05 decreased the net gwp and ghgi by 13 2 and 21 5 in wgv as well as decreased that by 21 and 28 6 in tgv the process of manufacture and transport of n fertilizer the n2o emission and the electricity generation for pumping irrigation were the three main contributors to vineyard net gwp thus we concluded that higher fruit production and lower net gwp could be realized concomitantly by reducing fertilizer and water application in wgv and tgv in north china keywords greenhouse gases emission net global warming potential vineyard fertilizer and water management 1 introduction global warming caused by excessive greenhouse gases ghgs emissions has now become one of the most serious problems drawing unprecedented attention ahmed 2020 it is estimated that approximately 25 of global ghgs emissions were derived from agricultural land burney et al 2010 tilman et al 2011 in agriculture nitrous oxide n2o and methane ch4 are the most important contributors to global warming potentials gwp due to their radiative forcing ipcc 2014 while the contribution of carbon dioxide co2 was less than 1 smith et al 2007 in addition the processes of the manufacture and transport of fertilizers and pesticides as well as the consumption of fossil fuels during irrigation and field operations could also produce ghgs grassini and cassman 2012 gao et al 2018 while agriculture releases significant amount of ghgs to the atmosphere the global technical mitigation potential from agriculture excluding fossil fuel offsets from biomass was estimated to be as high as 5 5 6 0 pg co2 equivalents yr 1 by 2030 smith et al 2008 most of the previous experiments have revealed that agricultural management practices e g fertilization and irrigation would change soil conditions causing a great effect on ghgs emissions gao et al 2015 huang et al 2018 for example fertilizer and water are the two most critical production resources that farmers can manage to ensure high yields and low environmental impacts in crops cultivation n2o and ch4 are greatly regulated by the amounts of fertilizer and irrigation input previous studious showed that n2o emissions positively responded to the amount of n fertilizer input shcherbak et al 2014 huang et al 2018 and chemical fertilizer n combined with organic fertilizer could strongly affected soil c n ratio which would regulate soil microbial activities further affected n2o and ch4 emissions from soil tao et al 2018 in addition soil moisture also greatly influences soil microbial activities through regulating soil oxygen content which would affect the generation or consumption of n2o and ch4 saurich et al 2019 proper fertilization and irrigation management practices play large roles in improving the soil physical properties and conditions control different microbial processes which can indirectly influence ghgs emissions jiang et al 2020 lourenco et al 2019 however there are trade offs among ghgs in agriculture for example rational fertilization would increase soil organic carbon soc to offset parts of above ghgs emissions due to biomass return shang et al 2011 zhou et al 2019 therefore to measure the overall effects in any system the concept of net global warming potential net gwp was proposed based on the radiative properties of all the ghgs emissions and carbon fixation expressed as co2 eq ha 1 yr 1 furthermore another concept greenhouse gas intensity ghgi has also been introduced to integrate climate change concerns net gwp with global food production using yield scaled approach grassini and cassman 2012 grape is one of the world s top four fruits which has been cultivated extensively around the world in china the land area devoted to grape has increased rapidly since 1980 and reached 0 87 million ha in 2017 and hebei province as one of the main grapes producing areas in china whose grape planting areas and yields accounted for 10 82 and 12 14 for the country respectively china statistical yearbook 2018 however the application amount of fertilizers in this region has increased markedly since the 1980s and chemical and organic fertilizers inputs in vineyards reached up to 1141 10 and 5250 00 kg ha 1 yr 1 lu et al 2008 yin et al 2013 respectively in addition multiple topdressings in combination with irrigation were also utilized during grape growing season consequently these factors may induce high ghgs emissions from the soil however few studies have investigated the ghgs emissions from vineyards and the extent to which net gwp and ghgi could be reduced following fertilizer and water managements reduced fertilizers in coordination with controlled irrigation in this fruit cultivation system remains unclear thus we presented a two year field measurement of n2o and ch4 fluxes as affected by different fertilizer and water managements in typical table grape and wine grape cultivation systems in north china to address these issues mentioned above the objectives of this research were to ‚Ö∞ calculate the net gwp and ghgi under different fertilizer and irrigation management in both vineyards ‚Ö± analyze the main source of net gwp in each grape management system and ‚Ö≤ comprehensively evaluate grape yields and groundwater use in order to identify which vineyard can produce low net gwp 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site description the study was conducted in a young grape cultivation base established in 2004 the base is located in changli county 119 05 e 39 45 n hebei province china fig 1 this region is characterized by a warm temperate continental monsoon climate with precipitation of 638 mm mean temperature of 11 c annual frost free period of 186 days and annual sunshine duration of 2809 h the soil is classified as sandy loam us soil taxonomy before applying the treatments the surface soil 0 20 cm was sampled in april 2016 and the basic soil physicochemical properties are shown in table 1 the wine grape vines cabernet sauvignon were planted in 2006 at a density of approximately 5000 vines ha 1 with 2 50 m between row and 1 m between vines during the growing season the double armed trellis system was applied the table grape vines vitis vinifera red globe were planted in 2008 at a density of about 2200 vines ha 1 with 3 80 m between row and 1 3 m between vines the grape vine cultivated model is vertical trellis fig 1 2 2 field experimental design the study was carried out in two vineyards of wine grape vineyard wgv and table grape vineyard tgv from april 2016 to april 2018 each vineyard of the study included two treatments the traditional practice tp and optimized practice op fig 1 each treatment was arranged in a completely randomized design with three replicates for the wgv each experimental plot covered an area of 125 m2 50 m 2 5 m and consisted of one row of plants with 50 plants in total in the tgv each plot measured 164 00 m2 43 2 m 3 80 m and consisted of one row of plants with 34 plants in total based on the obvious period determined by the growth characteristics of grape during the whole growth period the growth period can be divided into six periods namely the germination period 5 30 april new shoot growth period 30 may 10 june the flowering period 1 15 july the berry growth period 30 july 20 august the berry ripening period 1 15 september and the mature period of grape 25 september 15 october and the total growth period of both grape was about 165 d the detail application amount and rates of fertilizer can be seen in table 2 both of the fertilizer treatments received equivalent sheep manure 4500 kg ha 1 which contained organic matter 28 68 c 16 64 n 0 23 p2o5 0 55 and k2o 0 15 each year in the two vineyards all the sheep manure was applied as basal fertilization in the tp treatment and 50 sheep manure was applied as basal fertilization with the rest applied after harvest 20 october 10 november in the op treatment to offset the nutrient flowed to fruit and ensure soil nutrient supplid after harvest the application amount and rate of fertilizer in the tp treatment was set according local conventional cultivation regimes the fertilizer and water application rates of op treatment were designed based on the synergistic of previous studies yin et al 2013 wang et al 2014 qiao et al 2015 and the original soil fertility the fertilizers were applied by means of furrowing dressing and hand spread evenly to the furrows the furrows which were 15 cm in depth were dug in positions away from the grape vines by 20 cm after fertilizers application the furrows were covered with soil flood irrigation was adopted in the two vineyards after each fertilization event the amount of each irrigation was 300 m3 ha 1 in tp treatment and decreased by 30 in op treatment the total irrigation amounts and dates for the different treatments in the two vineyards also showed in table 2 2 3 ghgs emission measurements a static chamber method was used to measure the emissions of n2o and ch4 the chamber consisted of a base frame and a removable top chamber which was composed of polyvinyl chloride pvc material the top chamber diameter 13 80 cm height 25 80 cm which had a digital thermometer jm624 jinming instrument ltd tianjin china was fitted inside the base frame inserted into the soil to a depth of 10 cm in order to prevent gas leakage the space between the top chamber and base was sealed with water n2o and ch4 fluxes were measured at an interval of 10 days during the grape growing seasons march to november normally n2o and ch4 were sampled at day 1 2 3 5 and 7 after each fertigation and irrigation event the gas samples were collected once a day for 3 consecutive days after irrigation or precipitation events 20 mm and once a month during the winter december january february both samples were collected from each chamber using a 50 ml plastic syringe at an interval 10 min between 8 30 a m and 11 30 a m the concentrations of n2o and ch4 were analyzed using the gas chromatograph agilent technologies 7890a usa the temperature in the static chamber at each gas extraction point was recorded at the same time the fluxes f of the n2o and ch4 were calculated by the following equation 1 f œÅ h dc dt 273 273 t where f is the gases fluxes Œºg m 2 h 1 œÅ is the density of n2o or ch4 g cm 3 at standard atmospheric pressure h is the height cm of the sampling chamber dc dt is the average rate of change of gases concentration with in the sampling chamber Œºl l 1 min 1 and t is the temperature c in the chamber in this study to rationally estimate ghgs emissions from the scale of whole vineyard the ghgs were collected from the areas of ridges non fertilized zone nf and furrows fertilized zone the values of the weighted average of the ghgs emissions from the two sampling zones were calculated to represent the ghgs emissions of the scale of whole vineyard 2 4 gwp net gwp and ghgi measurements to better understand the climatic impacts of the grape vineyard systems under different fertilizer and water management we calculated the net gwp of the two vineyards systems in addition to ghgs emissions from soil the processes of manufacture and transportation of n p k fertilizers snyder et al 2009 zhang et al 2013 diesel fuel and pesticides for farm operation huang et al 2013 west and marland 2002 and electricity generation for pumping irrigation water zhang et al 2013 were considered into the calculation of the net gwp because previous studies showed that the contribution of net flux of co2 accounted for 1 to the agricultural gwp on a global scale smith et al 2007 the soil co2 flux was not considered in our analysis meanwhile conant et al 2010 referred that the change magnitude of soil organic carbon content was difficult to detect due to the change was slight as a result of which we neither considered the c sequestration caused by sheep manure input therefore the equations to calculate gwp and net gwp are shown as follow 2 gwp 298 n2o kg n2o ha 1 25 ch4 kg ch4 ha 1 3 net gwp 298 n2o kg n2o ha 1 25 ch4 kg ch4 ha 1 8 3 n rate kg n ha 1 1 5 p2o5 rate kg p2o5 ha 1 0 98 k2o rate kg k2o ha 1 1 3 electricity kwh ha 1 3 93 diesel fuel kg ha 1 18 pesticide kg ha 1 where 298 and 25 are the converting coefficients of n2o and ch4 to co2 eq forster et al 2007 8 3 1 5 0 98 1 3 3 93 and 18 are the co2 eq emissions during the processes of the manufacture and transportation per unit of n p and k zhang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 electricity consumption for pumping irrigation water zhang et al 2013 and diesel fuel and pesticides for farm operations huang et al 2013 west and marland 2002 respectively all the parameters above were suitable for chinese conditions which were already referred by gao et al 2015 in cropping systems besides ghgi kg co2 eq mg 1 fresh fruit was calculated by dividing the net gwp divided by the fresh fruit yields li et al 2015 qin et al 2010 and the equation to calculate ghgi is 4 g h g i n e t g w p f r u i t f r e s h y i e l d 2 5 grape yields and qualities and soil moister at the harvest time the grape weight of each plot in wgv and tgv was measured by manually and converted to total grape yield per hectare for each vineyard five representative grape plants were selected in each sampling plot and then three grape clusters from each plant were selected by vertical strata low medium and high in the middle parts of all selected grape clusters in each sampling plot twenty grapes fruit were further selected and mixed together which were used to analyze the nutrient qualities of the fruit vc was measured by the method of direct titration with 0 1 2 6 dichlorophenol indophenol and expressed as mg per 100 g fresh weight total titratable acidity tta was determined using direct titration with 0 1 n naoh solution and expressed as a percentage the juice ph was measured with a ph meter fiveeasy plus fe 20 mettler toledo switzerland total soluble solid tss was measured using a handed saccharin meter pal 1 atago japan 0 20 cm soil samples were taken randomly from each plot every two gas sampling starting on the second day after fertilizer irrigation or precipitation events 10 mm for a period of seven days after fertilization and three days after irrigation or precipitation at other times sampling was conducted per ten days except in winter when it was done once a month soil samples were immediately refrigerated in an ice box and taken to laborary a 20 g soil sample was oven dried to constant weight at 105 for 24 h to determine soil water holding capacity whc 2 6 statistical analyses all the statistical analyses were carried out using spss version 17 0 software package for windows statistically significant differences were tested using analysis of variance anova and least significant difference at the 5 level daily fluxes of n2o and ch4 were calculated by averaging fluxes for each chamber over the 24 h before averaging across the three replicate chambers to calculated annual cumulative fluxes calculated daily fluxes were then summed according to the measurement years gaps in the date set were filled by linear interpolation across missing days 3 results 3 1 air temperature and precipitation during the grape growing the mean monthly air temperature and precipitation in the vineyards were observed by an automated meteorological station adjacent to the study site during the two grape growing seasons april to the following march in 2016 and 2017 which were shown in fig 2 the air temperature ranged from 2 6 33 0 c with a mean of 16 1 c during the 2016 grape growing season and ranged from 1 9 c to 30 2 c with a mean of 17 7 c in the 2017 grape growing season in general the temperature kept rising during march to july and then continuously declined till february there were no significant differences in air temperature between the two grape growing seasons during the two grape growing seasons the heavy precipitation events in the study site mainly occurred in rainy seasons from june and august fig 2 the total precipitation during 2016 grape growing season was 859 8 mm which was 31 3 higher than those in 2017 3 2 grape yield and quality compared with the tp treatment during the two year study period the op treatment greatly increased grape yields table 3 with the average increase rates of 10 2 in wgv and 10 7 in tgv in 2016 the op treatment significantly p 0 05 increased the grape soluble solid contents by 6 0 in wgv and 8 8 in tgv as well as the op treatment decreased the grape titratable acidity contents by 13 9 in wgv in comparison with the tp treatment in 2017 the op treatment significantly increased the grape soluble solid contents by 7 2 and decreased the grape titratable acidity contents by 12 5 in tgv in comparison with the tp treatment compared with the tp treatments the vc contents were increased by 16 1 in wgv however there was no significant difference in the ph between the tp and op treatment in both vineyards 3 3 effect of fertilization and irrigation managements on n2o fluxes synchronized with the changes in soil whc during the two year study period the dynamics of n2o fluxes presented pulse like in different fertilizer managements and higher emissions events usually occurred after fertilizer and water managements fig 3 fig 4a b the maximums of n2o were usually detected within one week after fertilization and irrigation and the miximum usually occurred from december to feburary compared with fertilization and irrigation managements the variation of n2o fluxes was milder while the maximums were much lowered in the nf plots and the maximum were 0 52 g ha 1 h 1 in wgv and 0 21 g ha 1 h 1 in tgv respectively compared with the tp treatment the op treatment greatly decreased the n2o fluxes from april to october the significant p 0 05 sequence of n2o emission in all plots was tp op nf during the two year study period in both grape vineyards table 4 compared with the tp treatment the op treatment significantly p 0 05 decreased n2o emission by 27 9 and 49 8 in wgv and tgv respectively besides the cumulative n2o emission in tgv was significantly p 0 01 higher than that in wgv in the same fertilizer and water treatment during the two year study period and the oppsite trend occurred in the nf plot in 2016 3 4 effect of fertilization and irrigation managements on ch4 fluxes there was no significant difference on ch4 fluxes among different plots during the two year study period and the dynamics of ch4 fluxes also presented seasonal variations fig 3 and 4c all plots were found to be net sources of ch4 to the atmosphere during the main grape growing season from april to september and the maximum of ch4 fluxes were 0 02 mg ha 1 h 1 in wgv and 0 04 mg ha 1 h 1 in tgv respectively however all plots acted mainly as small sinks for ch4 in other monthes and ch4 fluxes were in the range from 0 02 to 0 mg ha 1 h 1 in wgv and from 0 04 to 0 mg ha 1 h 1 in tgv the sequence of annual cumulative ch4 emissions were greatly varied with the grape vineyards types table 4 and the op treatment significantly p 0 05 increased ch4 emissions in wgv and decreased that in tgv in comparison with the tp treatment compared with wgv tgv significantly p 0 01 increased the cumulative ch4 emissions under the tp treatment during the two year study period but the oppsite trend occurred under the op treatment during the two year study period both in 2016 p 0 05 and 2017 p 0 01 moreover the accumulation of n2o was further higher than ch4 in either grape vineyard during the study period 3 5 net gwp the main sources and ghgi on the scale of whole vineyard both of the two vineyards acted as a gwp and net gwp source when considering the combine soil n2o and ch4 emissions from the grape life cycle emissions of agricultural inputs on the scale of whole vineyard the gwp of both vineyards was determined by n2o emission which was attributed to the much higher accumulation and the higher converting coefficients than ch4 table 5 and the gwp of the whole vineyard scale was significantly p 0 05 lower in the op treatment than that in the tp treatment in either grape vineyard during the two year study except for that in wgv in 2017 table 5 similarly the op treatment significantly decreased the net gwp and ghgi by 18 6 20 and 26 1 27 7 in the wgv by 24 1 25 5 and 27 8 35 9 in the tgv in comparison with tp treatment table 5 compared with wgv tgv significantly p 0 05 table 5 increased the gwp net gwp and ghgi of the whole vineyard scale in the same treatment during the two year study period in the vineyard management system the electricity generation for pumping irrigation was the largest source of co2 eq emission fig 5 accounting for 45 1 51 9 and 33 9 42 9 in the wgv and the tgv respectively besides another two key factors were the manufacture and transport of n fertilizer and n2o emission and the sum of these accounted for 32 7 40 6 in the wgv and 43 1 53 6 in the tgv the contribution of ch4 was so low 0 01 that it could be ignored when evaluated the net gwp in the wgv and tgv fig 5 table 5 4 discussion 4 1 effect fertilizer and water treatment on grape yield and quality fruit yield and quality increased with the amount of fertilizer and water input within a certain range liu et al 2011 hou et al 2019 and it was positively correlated with photosynthesis conversion zhu et al 2010 which was strongly affected by water stress and fertilization amounts hou et al 2019 though the op treatment decreased the amount of irrigation in both vineyards in comparison with the tp treatment the precipitation would weaken this difference meanwhile excessive fertilizer input might inhibit the photosynthesis conversion further causing the higher yield and quality of grape in the op treatment than that in the tp treatment in addition lower amount of irrigation would reduce soil nutrient leaching to deep soil where grape roots could not access as a result of which the op treatment could increase the use efficiency of fertilizer moreover sheep manure was divided into two equal parts and then applied with chemical fertilizer at germination period and after harvest in the op treatment which not only avoided excessive nutrient input during grape early growing season but also ensured enough nutrient accumulated in plant could be utilized for the next growth season on the other hand fruit yield and quality directly affected economic income of farmers the op treatment had a higher grape yield and quality with a lower amount of water and fertilizer input than the tp treatment which contribute to realize the goal of coordinated development of economic and environmental benefits 4 2 n2o fluxes n2o emissions from agricultural soil was mainly regulated by the microbial processes of nitrification nitrifier denitrification and denitrification butterbachbahl et al 2013 and n2o emissions positively correlated with soil carbon content li et al 2005 manure fertilizer contained rich microbial available carbon which would stimulate microbial activity while organic matter could hinder the entry of mineral n in to the clay mineral qiu et al 2012 so compared with the tp treatment the op treatment greatly decreased n2o fluxed during grape germination period in both vineyards n2o emissions tend to grow in response to n fertilizer additions shcherbak et al 2014 li et al 2015 for instance kong et al 2013 observed that the cumulative production of n2o tended to increase with increasing n doses in apple orchard in addition reducing the amount of p and k fertilizer can also decreased soil n2o emissions zhang et al 2018 2019 zhang et al 2014a zhang et al 2014b in the present study since the op treatment decreased the amount of n p2o5 and k2o input in comparison with the tp treatment so the op treatment significantly p 0 05 lower the average n2o emission during the two year study period similarly the average n2o emission was significantly p 0 01 decreased in wgv in comparison with that in tgv in the same fertilizer treatment table 4 previous studies showed that high soil moister and air temperature are beneficial to produced n2o emissions dobbie and smith 2010 sehy et al 2003 horv√°th et al 2010 thus the peak fluxes of n2o appeared in warm seasons of may september figs 3 and 4 and the significantly higher n2o emission in 2016 than that in 2017 may be attributed to the higher precipitation enhancing soil moister in 2016 until now there was few studies have reported n2o emissions in vineyards n2o flux is affected by a series of factors and varied largely among different orchards our data are comparable with other studies but the results are divergent rowlings et al 2013 reported that n2o emission was 7 8 kg ha 1 yr 1 from a lychee orchard soil pang et al 2009 reported that the cumulative emission of n2o from an apple orchard was 2 05 kg ha 1 around one year however xie et al 2014 found that the annual cumulative n2o emission has reached 44 3 kg ha 1 zhang and niu 2016 observed that the annual n2o emission was 29 9 kg ha 1 in a grape vineyard in ningxia china the annual cumulative n2o emissions in this paper were 13 5 kg ha 1 in wgv and 40 4 kg ha 1 in tgv respectively these differences among those orchards above might be caused by variations in the nitrogen fertilizer rates measurement frequencies or the soil physicochemical properties 4 3 ch4 fluxes ch4 fluxes are closely related to the microbial processes of methanogens and methanotrophs which can be strongly affected by soil environmental conditions dunfield et al 1993 because of low fluxes and the hard predict caused by the complex mechanisms of soil c and n interactions guo et al 2010 linquist et al 2012 very few studies used to work on ch4 emission from orchard soils kong et al 2013 reported that flux was 2 6 kg ha 1 yr 1 from longan orchard werner et al 2006 found that the annual ch4 uptake was 0 05 kg ha 1 rowlings et al 2013 observed that the highest ch4 uptake of 2 9 Œºg m 2 h 1 occurred during dry conditions and the peak value of emission was 1 3 Œºg m 2 h 1 the present study showed that ch4 fluxes were also low in both vineyards 0 46 2 02 kg ha 1 yr 1 there might be several reasons 1 though methanotrophs and methanogens are both sensitive to the acidification of the environment methanotrophs are more tolerant to ph variations than methanogens dunfield et al 1993 2 due to the competition between methanemono oxygenase n fertilization on soil ch4 oxidation process and application of ammonium usually inhibit atmospheric ch4 oxidation resulting in the transfer of ch4 activity to nitrification the presence of n2o can also depress methane oxidation castro et al 1994 nesbit and breitenbeck 1992 3 the utilization of herbicide insecticide could also reduce ch4 oxidizing bacteria activities leading to ch4 drop from soil bharati et al 1999 topp 1993 as grape growth is susceptible to pathogens fungicides are commonly used during may to september which might be another factor to influence the release of ch4 4 the production of ch4 requires low oxygen condition when the soil was saturated during precipitation season plus extra irrigation oxygen content in water may limit ch4 production 4 4 comprehensively evaluating the net gwp in grape management system fertilizer and irrigation managements are two important factors affecting fruit yield and qualities in intensive agriculture systems the amount of irrigation and fertilizer input keep increasing in recent years erisman et al 2008 which results in the ghgs produced during the process of manufacture and transport of fertilizers diesel fuel and pesticides for farm operation and electricity generation for pumping irrigation water also can not be ignored in our study the main contribution factor was the electricity generation for pumping irrigation fig 5 which may be due to a plenty of water was required to ensure fruit quality hou et al 2019 besides another two key factors were the manufacture and transport of n fertilizer and n2o emission which was caused by excessive n fertilizer applied therefore compared with the tp treatment in both vineyards the op treatment significantly decreased the net gwp mainly through lowering the amount of fertilizer and irrigation table 5 this also might be the main reason for the significantly p 0 01 higher net gwp in tgv than that in wgv based on these truths mentioned above there was still considerable scope to reduce vineyards net gwp on the one hand enhancing nutrient use efficiency by improve fertilizer management or decreasing the amount of fertilizer and irrigation input while ensure fruit yield and quality to reduce co2 eq emissions snyder et al 2009 lin et al 2012 rowlings et al 2013 on the other hand due to the electricity generation for pumping irrigation and producing n fertilizer made a lager contribution on net gwp than other influence factors decreasing their converting coefficients by adopting best available technologies of production of n fertilizers and electrical power could be another rational pathway to reduce the net gwp in vineyard production system zhang et al 2013 for instance the co2 eq emissions during these two processes in developed countries 0 33 kg co2 eq kw h 1 and 2 60 4 5 kg co2 eq kg 1n were further lower than that in china mosier et al 2006 snyder et al 2009 5 conclusions the fluxes n2o and ch4 showed significant seasonal variation and the maximum of n2o and ch4 fluxes were occurred from april to september the op treatment can realize relatively high fruit yield and qualities and significantly p 0 05 decrease n2o emissions gwp net gwp and ghgi in both vineyards during the two year study the process of manufacture and transport of n fertilizer the n2o emission and the electricity generation for pumping irrigation were the main three influence factors to vineyard net gwp therefore rational decrease the amount of fertilizer and irrigation input would greatly decrease the net gwp and ghgi in both vineyards besides fertilizer and irrigation management might be an important reason for the difference on the gwp net gwp and ghgi between the wgv and the tgv consequently we conclude that the op treatments are recommended for higher fruit yield and lower net gwp and ghgi in both wine grape vineyard and table grape wine yard production system on the north china plain declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations

10438,ensuring fruit productivity and mitigation climate change under low consumption of fertilizer and irrigation can contribute to sustainable agriculture the objective of this study was to determine whether higher fruit production and lower net global warming potential net gwp could be realized concomitantly by reducing the amount of fertilizer and water applied the effect of water and fertilizer management on fruit yield n2o and ch4 emissions variation was measured over a two year period to gain insight into net gwp and greenhouse gas intensity ghgi in wine grape vineyard wgv and table grape vineyard tgv in north china two fertilizer and water managements were set in each vineyard optimized practice op treatment and traditional practice tp treatment the results showed that the op treatment significantly p 0 05 increased grape fruit by 10 2 and 10 7 in wgv and tgv respectively in comparison with tp treatment besides the fluxes n2o and ch4 showed significant seasonal variation and the maximum were occurred from april to september and the n2o emissions were strongly decreased in op treatment compared with the tp treatment the op treatment significantly p 0 05 decreased the net gwp and ghgi by 13 2 and 21 5 in wgv as well as decreased that by 21 and 28 6 in tgv the process of manufacture and transport of n fertilizer the n2o emission and the electricity generation for pumping irrigation were the three main contributors to vineyard net gwp thus we concluded that higher fruit production and lower net gwp could be realized concomitantly by reducing fertilizer and water application in wgv and tgv in north china keywords greenhouse gases emission net global warming potential vineyard fertilizer and water management 1 introduction global warming caused by excessive greenhouse gases ghgs emissions has now become one of the most serious problems drawing unprecedented attention ahmed 2020 it is estimated that approximately 25 of global ghgs emissions were derived from agricultural land burney et al 2010 tilman et al 2011 in agriculture nitrous oxide n2o and methane ch4 are the most important contributors to global warming potentials gwp due to their radiative forcing ipcc 2014 while the contribution of carbon dioxide co2 was less than 1 smith et al 2007 in addition the processes of the manufacture and transport of fertilizers and pesticides as well as the consumption of fossil fuels during irrigation and field operations could also produce ghgs grassini and cassman 2012 gao et al 2018 while agriculture releases significant amount of ghgs to the atmosphere the global technical mitigation potential from agriculture excluding fossil fuel offsets from biomass was estimated to be as high as 5 5 6 0 pg co2 equivalents yr 1 by 2030 smith et al 2008 most of the previous experiments have revealed that agricultural management practices e g fertilization and irrigation would change soil conditions causing a great effect on ghgs emissions gao et al 2015 huang et al 2018 for example fertilizer and water are the two most critical production resources that farmers can manage to ensure high yields and low environmental impacts in crops cultivation n2o and ch4 are greatly regulated by the amounts of fertilizer and irrigation input previous studious showed that n2o emissions positively responded to the amount of n fertilizer input shcherbak et al 2014 huang et al 2018 and chemical fertilizer n combined with organic fertilizer could strongly affected soil c n ratio which would regulate soil microbial activities further affected n2o and ch4 emissions from soil tao et al 2018 in addition soil moisture also greatly influences soil microbial activities through regulating soil oxygen content which would affect the generation or consumption of n2o and ch4 saurich et al 2019 proper fertilization and irrigation management practices play large roles in improving the soil physical properties and conditions control different microbial processes which can indirectly influence ghgs emissions jiang et al 2020 lourenco et al 2019 however there are trade offs among ghgs in agriculture for example rational fertilization would increase soil organic carbon soc to offset parts of above ghgs emissions due to biomass return shang et al 2011 zhou et al 2019 therefore to measure the overall effects in any system the concept of net global warming potential net gwp was proposed based on the radiative properties of all the ghgs emissions and carbon fixation expressed as co2 eq ha 1 yr 1 furthermore another concept greenhouse gas intensity ghgi has also been introduced to integrate climate change concerns net gwp with global food production using yield scaled approach grassini and cassman 2012 grape is one of the world s top four fruits which has been cultivated extensively around the world in china the land area devoted to grape has increased rapidly since 1980 and reached 0 87 million ha in 2017 and hebei province as one of the main grapes producing areas in china whose grape planting areas and yields accounted for 10 82 and 12 14 for the country respectively china statistical yearbook 2018 however the application amount of fertilizers in this region has increased markedly since the 1980s and chemical and organic fertilizers inputs in vineyards reached up to 1141 10 and 5250 00 kg ha 1 yr 1 lu et al 2008 yin et al 2013 respectively in addition multiple topdressings in combination with irrigation were also utilized during grape growing season consequently these factors may induce high ghgs emissions from the soil however few studies have investigated the ghgs emissions from vineyards and the extent to which net gwp and ghgi could be reduced following fertilizer and water managements reduced fertilizers in coordination with controlled irrigation in this fruit cultivation system remains unclear thus we presented a two year field measurement of n2o and ch4 fluxes as affected by different fertilizer and water managements in typical table grape and wine grape cultivation systems in north china to address these issues mentioned above the objectives of this research were to ‚Ö∞ calculate the net gwp and ghgi under different fertilizer and irrigation management in both vineyards ‚Ö± analyze the main source of net gwp in each grape management system and ‚Ö≤ comprehensively evaluate grape yields and groundwater use in order to identify which vineyard can produce low net gwp 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site description the study was conducted in a young grape cultivation base established in 2004 the base is located in changli county 119 05 e 39 45 n hebei province china fig 1 this region is characterized by a warm temperate continental monsoon climate with precipitation of 638 mm mean temperature of 11 c annual frost free period of 186 days and annual sunshine duration of 2809 h the soil is classified as sandy loam us soil taxonomy before applying the treatments the surface soil 0 20 cm was sampled in april 2016 and the basic soil physicochemical properties are shown in table 1 the wine grape vines cabernet sauvignon were planted in 2006 at a density of approximately 5000 vines ha 1 with 2 50 m between row and 1 m between vines during the growing season the double armed trellis system was applied the table grape vines vitis vinifera red globe were planted in 2008 at a density of about 2200 vines ha 1 with 3 80 m between row and 1 3 m between vines the grape vine cultivated model is vertical trellis fig 1 2 2 field experimental design the study was carried out in two vineyards of wine grape vineyard wgv and table grape vineyard tgv from april 2016 to april 2018 each vineyard of the study included two treatments the traditional practice tp and optimized practice op fig 1 each treatment was arranged in a completely randomized design with three replicates for the wgv each experimental plot covered an area of 125 m2 50 m 2 5 m and consisted of one row of plants with 50 plants in total in the tgv each plot measured 164 00 m2 43 2 m 3 80 m and consisted of one row of plants with 34 plants in total based on the obvious period determined by the growth characteristics of grape during the whole growth period the growth period can be divided into six periods namely the germination period 5 30 april new shoot growth period 30 may 10 june the flowering period 1 15 july the berry growth period 30 july 20 august the berry ripening period 1 15 september and the mature period of grape 25 september 15 october and the total growth period of both grape was about 165 d the detail application amount and rates of fertilizer can be seen in table 2 both of the fertilizer treatments received equivalent sheep manure 4500 kg ha 1 which contained organic matter 28 68 c 16 64 n 0 23 p2o5 0 55 and k2o 0 15 each year in the two vineyards all the sheep manure was applied as basal fertilization in the tp treatment and 50 sheep manure was applied as basal fertilization with the rest applied after harvest 20 october 10 november in the op treatment to offset the nutrient flowed to fruit and ensure soil nutrient supplid after harvest the application amount and rate of fertilizer in the tp treatment was set according local conventional cultivation regimes the fertilizer and water application rates of op treatment were designed based on the synergistic of previous studies yin et al 2013 wang et al 2014 qiao et al 2015 and the original soil fertility the fertilizers were applied by means of furrowing dressing and hand spread evenly to the furrows the furrows which were 15 cm in depth were dug in positions away from the grape vines by 20 cm after fertilizers application the furrows were covered with soil flood irrigation was adopted in the two vineyards after each fertilization event the amount of each irrigation was 300 m3 ha 1 in tp treatment and decreased by 30 in op treatment the total irrigation amounts and dates for the different treatments in the two vineyards also showed in table 2 2 3 ghgs emission measurements a static chamber method was used to measure the emissions of n2o and ch4 the chamber consisted of a base frame and a removable top chamber which was composed of polyvinyl chloride pvc material the top chamber diameter 13 80 cm height 25 80 cm which had a digital thermometer jm624 jinming instrument ltd tianjin china was fitted inside the base frame inserted into the soil to a depth of 10 cm in order to prevent gas leakage the space between the top chamber and base was sealed with water n2o and ch4 fluxes were measured at an interval of 10 days during the grape growing seasons march to november normally n2o and ch4 were sampled at day 1 2 3 5 and 7 after each fertigation and irrigation event the gas samples were collected once a day for 3 consecutive days after irrigation or precipitation events 20 mm and once a month during the winter december january february both samples were collected from each chamber using a 50 ml plastic syringe at an interval 10 min between 8 30 a m and 11 30 a m the concentrations of n2o and ch4 were analyzed using the gas chromatograph agilent technologies 7890a usa the temperature in the static chamber at each gas extraction point was recorded at the same time the fluxes f of the n2o and ch4 were calculated by the following equation 1 f œÅ h dc dt 273 273 t where f is the gases fluxes Œºg m 2 h 1 œÅ is the density of n2o or ch4 g cm 3 at standard atmospheric pressure h is the height cm of the sampling chamber dc dt is the average rate of change of gases concentration with in the sampling chamber Œºl l 1 min 1 and t is the temperature c in the chamber in this study to rationally estimate ghgs emissions from the scale of whole vineyard the ghgs were collected from the areas of ridges non fertilized zone nf and furrows fertilized zone the values of the weighted average of the ghgs emissions from the two sampling zones were calculated to represent the ghgs emissions of the scale of whole vineyard 2 4 gwp net gwp and ghgi measurements to better understand the climatic impacts of the grape vineyard systems under different fertilizer and water management we calculated the net gwp of the two vineyards systems in addition to ghgs emissions from soil the processes of manufacture and transportation of n p k fertilizers snyder et al 2009 zhang et al 2013 diesel fuel and pesticides for farm operation huang et al 2013 west and marland 2002 and electricity generation for pumping irrigation water zhang et al 2013 were considered into the calculation of the net gwp because previous studies showed that the contribution of net flux of co2 accounted for 1 to the agricultural gwp on a global scale smith et al 2007 the soil co2 flux was not considered in our analysis meanwhile conant et al 2010 referred that the change magnitude of soil organic carbon content was difficult to detect due to the change was slight as a result of which we neither considered the c sequestration caused by sheep manure input therefore the equations to calculate gwp and net gwp are shown as follow 2 gwp 298 n2o kg n2o ha 1 25 ch4 kg ch4 ha 1 3 net gwp 298 n2o kg n2o ha 1 25 ch4 kg ch4 ha 1 8 3 n rate kg n ha 1 1 5 p2o5 rate kg p2o5 ha 1 0 98 k2o rate kg k2o ha 1 1 3 electricity kwh ha 1 3 93 diesel fuel kg ha 1 18 pesticide kg ha 1 where 298 and 25 are the converting coefficients of n2o and ch4 to co2 eq forster et al 2007 8 3 1 5 0 98 1 3 3 93 and 18 are the co2 eq emissions during the processes of the manufacture and transportation per unit of n p and k zhang et al 2013 huang et al 2013 electricity consumption for pumping irrigation water zhang et al 2013 and diesel fuel and pesticides for farm operations huang et al 2013 west and marland 2002 respectively all the parameters above were suitable for chinese conditions which were already referred by gao et al 2015 in cropping systems besides ghgi kg co2 eq mg 1 fresh fruit was calculated by dividing the net gwp divided by the fresh fruit yields li et al 2015 qin et al 2010 and the equation to calculate ghgi is 4 g h g i n e t g w p f r u i t f r e s h y i e l d 2 5 grape yields and qualities and soil moister at the harvest time the grape weight of each plot in wgv and tgv was measured by manually and converted to total grape yield per hectare for each vineyard five representative grape plants were selected in each sampling plot and then three grape clusters from each plant were selected by vertical strata low medium and high in the middle parts of all selected grape clusters in each sampling plot twenty grapes fruit were further selected and mixed together which were used to analyze the nutrient qualities of the fruit vc was measured by the method of direct titration with 0 1 2 6 dichlorophenol indophenol and expressed as mg per 100 g fresh weight total titratable acidity tta was determined using direct titration with 0 1 n naoh solution and expressed as a percentage the juice ph was measured with a ph meter fiveeasy plus fe 20 mettler toledo switzerland total soluble solid tss was measured using a handed saccharin meter pal 1 atago japan 0 20 cm soil samples were taken randomly from each plot every two gas sampling starting on the second day after fertilizer irrigation or precipitation events 10 mm for a period of seven days after fertilization and three days after irrigation or precipitation at other times sampling was conducted per ten days except in winter when it was done once a month soil samples were immediately refrigerated in an ice box and taken to laborary a 20 g soil sample was oven dried to constant weight at 105 for 24 h to determine soil water holding capacity whc 2 6 statistical analyses all the statistical analyses were carried out using spss version 17 0 software package for windows statistically significant differences were tested using analysis of variance anova and least significant difference at the 5 level daily fluxes of n2o and ch4 were calculated by averaging fluxes for each chamber over the 24 h before averaging across the three replicate chambers to calculated annual cumulative fluxes calculated daily fluxes were then summed according to the measurement years gaps in the date set were filled by linear interpolation across missing days 3 results 3 1 air temperature and precipitation during the grape growing the mean monthly air temperature and precipitation in the vineyards were observed by an automated meteorological station adjacent to the study site during the two grape growing seasons april to the following march in 2016 and 2017 which were shown in fig 2 the air temperature ranged from 2 6 33 0 c with a mean of 16 1 c during the 2016 grape growing season and ranged from 1 9 c to 30 2 c with a mean of 17 7 c in the 2017 grape growing season in general the temperature kept rising during march to july and then continuously declined till february there were no significant differences in air temperature between the two grape growing seasons during the two grape growing seasons the heavy precipitation events in the study site mainly occurred in rainy seasons from june and august fig 2 the total precipitation during 2016 grape growing season was 859 8 mm which was 31 3 higher than those in 2017 3 2 grape yield and quality compared with the tp treatment during the two year study period the op treatment greatly increased grape yields table 3 with the average increase rates of 10 2 in wgv and 10 7 in tgv in 2016 the op treatment significantly p 0 05 increased the grape soluble solid contents by 6 0 in wgv and 8 8 in tgv as well as the op treatment decreased the grape titratable acidity contents by 13 9 in wgv in comparison with the tp treatment in 2017 the op treatment significantly increased the grape soluble solid contents by 7 2 and decreased the grape titratable acidity contents by 12 5 in tgv in comparison with the tp treatment compared with the tp treatments the vc contents were increased by 16 1 in wgv however there was no significant difference in the ph between the tp and op treatment in both vineyards 3 3 effect of fertilization and irrigation managements on n2o fluxes synchronized with the changes in soil whc during the two year study period the dynamics of n2o fluxes presented pulse like in different fertilizer managements and higher emissions events usually occurred after fertilizer and water managements fig 3 fig 4a b the maximums of n2o were usually detected within one week after fertilization and irrigation and the miximum usually occurred from december to feburary compared with fertilization and irrigation managements the variation of n2o fluxes was milder while the maximums were much lowered in the nf plots and the maximum were 0 52 g ha 1 h 1 in wgv and 0 21 g ha 1 h 1 in tgv respectively compared with the tp treatment the op treatment greatly decreased the n2o fluxes from april to october the significant p 0 05 sequence of n2o emission in all plots was tp op nf during the two year study period in both grape vineyards table 4 compared with the tp treatment the op treatment significantly p 0 05 decreased n2o emission by 27 9 and 49 8 in wgv and tgv respectively besides the cumulative n2o emission in tgv was significantly p 0 01 higher than that in wgv in the same fertilizer and water treatment during the two year study period and the oppsite trend occurred in the nf plot in 2016 3 4 effect of fertilization and irrigation managements on ch4 fluxes there was no significant difference on ch4 fluxes among different plots during the two year study period and the dynamics of ch4 fluxes also presented seasonal variations fig 3 and 4c all plots were found to be net sources of ch4 to the atmosphere during the main grape growing season from april to september and the maximum of ch4 fluxes were 0 02 mg ha 1 h 1 in wgv and 0 04 mg ha 1 h 1 in tgv respectively however all plots acted mainly as small sinks for ch4 in other monthes and ch4 fluxes were in the range from 0 02 to 0 mg ha 1 h 1 in wgv and from 0 04 to 0 mg ha 1 h 1 in tgv the sequence of annual cumulative ch4 emissions were greatly varied with the grape vineyards types table 4 and the op treatment significantly p 0 05 increased ch4 emissions in wgv and decreased that in tgv in comparison with the tp treatment compared with wgv tgv significantly p 0 01 increased the cumulative ch4 emissions under the tp treatment during the two year study period but the oppsite trend occurred under the op treatment during the two year study period both in 2016 p 0 05 and 2017 p 0 01 moreover the accumulation of n2o was further higher than ch4 in either grape vineyard during the study period 3 5 net gwp the main sources and ghgi on the scale of whole vineyard both of the two vineyards acted as a gwp and net gwp source when considering the combine soil n2o and ch4 emissions from the grape life cycle emissions of agricultural inputs on the scale of whole vineyard the gwp of both vineyards was determined by n2o emission which was attributed to the much higher accumulation and the higher converting coefficients than ch4 table 5 and the gwp of the whole vineyard scale was significantly p 0 05 lower in the op treatment than that in the tp treatment in either grape vineyard during the two year study except for that in wgv in 2017 table 5 similarly the op treatment significantly decreased the net gwp and ghgi by 18 6 20 and 26 1 27 7 in the wgv by 24 1 25 5 and 27 8 35 9 in the tgv in comparison with tp treatment table 5 compared with wgv tgv significantly p 0 05 table 5 increased the gwp net gwp and ghgi of the whole vineyard scale in the same treatment during the two year study period in the vineyard management system the electricity generation for pumping irrigation was the largest source of co2 eq emission fig 5 accounting for 45 1 51 9 and 33 9 42 9 in the wgv and the tgv respectively besides another two key factors were the manufacture and transport of n fertilizer and n2o emission and the sum of these accounted for 32 7 40 6 in the wgv and 43 1 53 6 in the tgv the contribution of ch4 was so low 0 01 that it could be ignored when evaluated the net gwp in the wgv and tgv fig 5 table 5 4 discussion 4 1 effect fertilizer and water treatment on grape yield and quality fruit yield and quality increased with the amount of fertilizer and water input within a certain range liu et al 2011 hou et al 2019 and it was positively correlated with photosynthesis conversion zhu et al 2010 which was strongly affected by water stress and fertilization amounts hou et al 2019 though the op treatment decreased the amount of irrigation in both vineyards in comparison with the tp treatment the precipitation would weaken this difference meanwhile excessive fertilizer input might inhibit the photosynthesis conversion further causing the higher yield and quality of grape in the op treatment than that in the tp treatment in addition lower amount of irrigation would reduce soil nutrient leaching to deep soil where grape roots could not access as a result of which the op treatment could increase the use efficiency of fertilizer moreover sheep manure was divided into two equal parts and then applied with chemical fertilizer at germination period and after harvest in the op treatment which not only avoided excessive nutrient input during grape early growing season but also ensured enough nutrient accumulated in plant could be utilized for the next growth season on the other hand fruit yield and quality directly affected economic income of farmers the op treatment had a higher grape yield and quality with a lower amount of water and fertilizer input than the tp treatment which contribute to realize the goal of coordinated development of economic and environmental benefits 4 2 n2o fluxes n2o emissions from agricultural soil was mainly regulated by the microbial processes of nitrification nitrifier denitrification and denitrification butterbachbahl et al 2013 and n2o emissions positively correlated with soil carbon content li et al 2005 manure fertilizer contained rich microbial available carbon which would stimulate microbial activity while organic matter could hinder the entry of mineral n in to the clay mineral qiu et al 2012 so compared with the tp treatment the op treatment greatly decreased n2o fluxed during grape germination period in both vineyards n2o emissions tend to grow in response to n fertilizer additions shcherbak et al 2014 li et al 2015 for instance kong et al 2013 observed that the cumulative production of n2o tended to increase with increasing n doses in apple orchard in addition reducing the amount of p and k fertilizer can also decreased soil n2o emissions zhang et al 2018 2019 zhang et al 2014a zhang et al 2014b in the present study since the op treatment decreased the amount of n p2o5 and k2o input in comparison with the tp treatment so the op treatment significantly p 0 05 lower the average n2o emission during the two year study period similarly the average n2o emission was significantly p 0 01 decreased in wgv in comparison with that in tgv in the same fertilizer treatment table 4 previous studies showed that high soil moister and air temperature are beneficial to produced n2o emissions dobbie and smith 2010 sehy et al 2003 horv√°th et al 2010 thus the peak fluxes of n2o appeared in warm seasons of may september figs 3 and 4 and the significantly higher n2o emission in 2016 than that in 2017 may be attributed to the higher precipitation enhancing soil moister in 2016 until now there was few studies have reported n2o emissions in vineyards n2o flux is affected by a series of factors and varied largely among different orchards our data are comparable with other studies but the results are divergent rowlings et al 2013 reported that n2o emission was 7 8 kg ha 1 yr 1 from a lychee orchard soil pang et al 2009 reported that the cumulative emission of n2o from an apple orchard was 2 05 kg ha 1 around one year however xie et al 2014 found that the annual cumulative n2o emission has reached 44 3 kg ha 1 zhang and niu 2016 observed that the annual n2o emission was 29 9 kg ha 1 in a grape vineyard in ningxia china the annual cumulative n2o emissions in this paper were 13 5 kg ha 1 in wgv and 40 4 kg ha 1 in tgv respectively these differences among those orchards above might be caused by variations in the nitrogen fertilizer rates measurement frequencies or the soil physicochemical properties 4 3 ch4 fluxes ch4 fluxes are closely related to the microbial processes of methanogens and methanotrophs which can be strongly affected by soil environmental conditions dunfield et al 1993 because of low fluxes and the hard predict caused by the complex mechanisms of soil c and n interactions guo et al 2010 linquist et al 2012 very few studies used to work on ch4 emission from orchard soils kong et al 2013 reported that flux was 2 6 kg ha 1 yr 1 from longan orchard werner et al 2006 found that the annual ch4 uptake was 0 05 kg ha 1 rowlings et al 2013 observed that the highest ch4 uptake of 2 9 Œºg m 2 h 1 occurred during dry conditions and the peak value of emission was 1 3 Œºg m 2 h 1 the present study showed that ch4 fluxes were also low in both vineyards 0 46 2 02 kg ha 1 yr 1 there might be several reasons 1 though methanotrophs and methanogens are both sensitive to the acidification of the environment methanotrophs are more tolerant to ph variations than methanogens dunfield et al 1993 2 due to the competition between methanemono oxygenase n fertilization on soil ch4 oxidation process and application of ammonium usually inhibit atmospheric ch4 oxidation resulting in the transfer of ch4 activity to nitrification the presence of n2o can also depress methane oxidation castro et al 1994 nesbit and breitenbeck 1992 3 the utilization of herbicide insecticide could also reduce ch4 oxidizing bacteria activities leading to ch4 drop from soil bharati et al 1999 topp 1993 as grape growth is susceptible to pathogens fungicides are commonly used during may to september which might be another factor to influence the release of ch4 4 the production of ch4 requires low oxygen condition when the soil was saturated during precipitation season plus extra irrigation oxygen content in water may limit ch4 production 4 4 comprehensively evaluating the net gwp in grape management system fertilizer and irrigation managements are two important factors affecting fruit yield and qualities in intensive agriculture systems the amount of irrigation and fertilizer input keep increasing in recent years erisman et al 2008 which results in the ghgs produced during the process of manufacture and transport of fertilizers diesel fuel and pesticides for farm operation and electricity generation for pumping irrigation water also can not be ignored in our study the main contribution factor was the electricity generation for pumping irrigation fig 5 which may be due to a plenty of water was required to ensure fruit quality hou et al 2019 besides another two key factors were the manufacture and transport of n fertilizer and n2o emission which was caused by excessive n fertilizer applied therefore compared with the tp treatment in both vineyards the op treatment significantly decreased the net gwp mainly through lowering the amount of fertilizer and irrigation table 5 this also might be the main reason for the significantly p 0 01 higher net gwp in tgv than that in wgv based on these truths mentioned above there was still considerable scope to reduce vineyards net gwp on the one hand enhancing nutrient use efficiency by improve fertilizer management or decreasing the amount of fertilizer and irrigation input while ensure fruit yield and quality to reduce co2 eq emissions snyder et al 2009 lin et al 2012 rowlings et al 2013 on the other hand due to the electricity generation for pumping irrigation and producing n fertilizer made a lager contribution on net gwp than other influence factors decreasing their converting coefficients by adopting best available technologies of production of n fertilizers and electrical power could be another rational pathway to reduce the net gwp in vineyard production system zhang et al 2013 for instance the co2 eq emissions during these two processes in developed countries 0 33 kg co2 eq kw h 1 and 2 60 4 5 kg co2 eq kg 1n were further lower than that in china mosier et al 2006 snyder et al 2009 5 conclusions the fluxes n2o and ch4 showed significant seasonal variation and the maximum of n2o and ch4 fluxes were occurred from april to september the op treatment can realize relatively high fruit yield and qualities and significantly p 0 05 decrease n2o emissions gwp net gwp and ghgi in both vineyards during the two year study the process of manufacture and transport of n fertilizer the n2o emission and the electricity generation for pumping irrigation were the main three influence factors to vineyard net gwp therefore rational decrease the amount of fertilizer and irrigation input would greatly decrease the net gwp and ghgi in both vineyards besides fertilizer and irrigation management might be an important reason for the difference on the gwp net gwp and ghgi between the wgv and the tgv consequently we conclude that the op treatments are recommended for higher fruit yield and lower net gwp and ghgi in both wine grape vineyard and table grape wine yard production system on the north china plain declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations

10439,the water potential œàp has been widely used as an indicator of plant water status for irrigation management purposes the simple infrastructure needed for its measurement and its direct relation to basic plant physiological processes have contributed to the popularity of the methodology when used for irrigation scheduling it is commonly assumed that an unavoidable relationship exists between plant transpiration t soil water content and œàp nevertheless it is worth remembering that variations in œàp are not solely related to changes in soil water content but are also an expression of the interaction between the plant and its environment we used a soil plant atmosphere continuum spac model to highlight the importance of considering such interactions through a series of in silico experiments our analysis shows that evaporative demand the hydraulic architecture of the plant and the texture and depth of the soil play key roles in the final œàp observed to establish irrigation programs based on œàp without considering the environmental and plant factors that influence it can create the paradox of having a plant that suffers greater water stress even when high irrigation volumes are applied the conclusions from our in silico analysis provide some warnings that should be considered when using œàp to schedule irrigation keywords water potential irrigation irrigation management spac 1 introduction water potential œàp is probably the most widespread indicator used to monitor the water status of a plant but what is it exactly the œàp measures the energy status of the water in a system referred to as the energy of free and pure water campbell 1985 expressed another way it is the amount by which free gibbs energy changes when water in a system varies while pressure and temperature remain constant campbell and norman 1998 jones 2013 the œàp can be decomposed into pressure osmotic and gravity potentials each affecting the œàp in specific ways the osmotic potential refers to the osmotic pressure generated in a compartment with solutes like a cell separated from pure water by a semipermeable membrane the pressure potential refers to the difference in hydrostatic pressure from a reference and can be positive or negative tension finally the gravity potential often overlooked results from differences in height from the reference level i e to changes in the potential energy jones 2013 kramer 1969 for a more in depth description of œàp and its components the reader is encouraged to consult jones 2013 or kirkham 2004 the cohesion tension theory establishes that the difference in water potential between soil and atmosphere is the driving force for transpiration t tyree and zimmermann 2002b the catenary hypothesis of van den honert 1948 provides a useful framework to study the relation between transpiration t œàp and soil plant resistances r van den honert 1948 if capacitance is not considered œàp can be expressed as 1 œà p t r œà s o i l according to eq 1 the measured œàp will depend on the plant transpiration t on the soil water potential œàsoil and on the obstacles for the movement of water from the soil to the atmosphere through the plant i e on the resistance r to water movement changes in r are related to variations in the hydraulic architecture of the plant and in the physical properties of the soil sperry et al 1998 tyree and zimmermann 2002a low soil temperatures or dry conditions induce changes in root resistance that modify its uptake capacity bristow et al 1984 garcia tejera et al 2016 lopez bernal et al 2015 north and nobel 1997a xylem cavitation during stress reduces the number of conductive vessels and leads to increased trunk resistance pockman and sperry 2000 venturas et al 2017 at a macro scale changes in root or canopy morphology also alter r changes in root to shoot ratios have been observed in trees mokany et al 2006 for instance under water stress there is an increase in root to shoot ratios this plastic response alters the water supply roots and demand leaves relationship favoring the maintenance of a better plant water status during drought hsiao and xu 2000 one problem with eq 1 is that t and œàp are not independent a negative feedback response is well known between stomatal conductance gs and œàp affecting t buckley 2019 buckley et al 2003 tuzet et al 2003 any decline in œàp below a certain threshold or critical water potential will induce stomata closure and reduce t the sensitivity of the stomata to œàp has been used to classify plants as isohydric or anisohydric however the way that these two concepts are defined differs among authors for tardieu and simonneau 1998 the relationship between œàsoil and œàp at midday during drought defines the iso anisohydric behavior an isohydric plant will maintain a constant midday leaf water potential regardless of the œàsoil whilst in an anisohydric plant œàp will decline with œàsoil in contrast mart√≠nez vilalta et al 2014 propose use of the slope of the relationship between midday œàp and predawn œàp if the slope is less than 1 the plant will be isohydric and if it is higher than 1 it will be anisohydric mart√≠nez vilalta et al 2014 klein 2014 observed that iso anisohydric behavior represents a gradient rather than two sperate hydraulic states given the discrepancies in the definitions and the strong effect that environmental factors have on plant water relations hochberg et al 2018 proposed to abandon the iso anisohydric terminology and to go for a more fundamental framework based on the direct relation between gs and œàp in the present paper we will follow hochberg et al 2018 recommendation we have spoken about the sensitivity of the stomata to œàp decline but growth is the first process that is affected when œàp drops hsiao 1973 the different sensitivities of gs and growth to changes in œàp have been used to establish irrigation programs in situations where the objective is biomass production the goal is the maintenance of a high œàp keeping a high œàp ensures plant growth and avoids any photosynthesis limitation maximizing canopy size and radiation interception hsiao 1973 tardieu et al 2018 this strategy is typically used in annual crops where yield is a fraction of the biomass produced evans 1998 in tree crops and vines however economic returns are related to both biomass and crop quality fereres and soriano 2007 the induction of slight to moderate stresses at specific phenological stages through deficit irrigation programs has been shown to be positively related to fruit firmness and sugar concentration basile et al 2011 girona et al 2009 lopez et al 2012 the maintenance of a slight water stress allows control of excessive growth favoring an optimal light environment inside the canopy and improving the partitioning of carbohydrates to reproductive structures chalmers et al 1981 johnson and handley 2000 jones 2004 irrigation programs based on œàp use thresholds to trigger irrigation once the threshold is passed the irrigation system is triggered consequently the œàp needs to be monitored the most widely used methodology to measure œàp involves the use of a pressure chamber scholander et al 1965 in the pressure chamber technique a positive pressure is applied to an excised plant section inside a chamber until the liquid content of the sample is forced out at this point the applied pressure equals œàp boyer 1995 for irrigation management purposes the pressure chamber technique is used at different times of the day if the measurement is performed during the night when t is negligible the œàp can be used as a surrogate of œàsoil see eq 1 this is called the predawn water potential œàpd boyer 1995 on a clear day the minimum œàp is usually achieved at midday when the noon measurement is performed on sun exposed leaves the value obtained is the midday leaf water potential however if the leaf is covered with a plastic bag and sealed for enough time the leaf water potential equilibrates with the water potential of the stem giving the stem water potential œàstem levin 2019 given all of the above several questions arise if r influences the relationship between t and œàp what are the implications of changes in r through variations in soil texture or plant morphology how will plants with different œàcrit behave in the same environment what are the risks of using a discrete methodology to monitor œàp what implications does the use of midday or predawn water potential have for irrigation scheduling to answer these questions we used a soil plant atmosphere continuum spac model to perform a series of in silico virtual experiments the great advantage of using a model is that one of the variables that influence œàp can be varied while all the others can be held constant in this way it is possible to explore the complicated interactions between the several factors that define œàp thus the objective of the present paper is to show how the variables that influence œàp might affect irrigation programs based on the water potential 2 materials and methods the effect of changes in spac components on the relationship between t œàp and the relative soil water content rswc was studied through a series of in silico experiments simulations were performed using the spac model with a multi compartment solution garc√≠a tejera et al 2017b the model has been previously validated on olive trees at different levels of water stress showing its capacity to accurately simulate t and œàp garc√≠a tejera et al 2017a briefly the model simulates t and œàp using the catenary hypothesis van den honert 1948 in which the soil plant atmosphere system is viewed as a set of resistances either in parallel or in series the canopy is discretized into sun shade leaves depury and farquhar 1997 while the soil is divided vertically into different layers and split horizontally into two compartments the wet compartment fwet which will include the area influenced by the localized irrigation system and the dry compartment fdry which represents the rest of the soil these compartments allow characterization of heterogeneity in root length distribution and soil water content inherent to the use of localized irrigation systems regulation of stomatal conductance is simulated using the tuzet et al 2003 model which includes the effect of water potential changes on stomatal response the variability of root resistivity i e resistance to water uptake per unit root surface area to temperature and soil dryness is modeled on the basis of garcia tejera et al 2016 and bristow et al 1984 fig 1 shows a schematic representation of the model the leaf water potential in the model is calculated for each leaf class sun or shaded as 2

corresponding soil site œàsoil i j the subscripts i and j in the resistances correspond to the soil layer and compartment number the simulations were performed using olive olea europaea l as the model tree the weather conditions imposed were obtained from a weather station located in cordoba 37 86 n 4 80 w spain inputs for the model were obtained from the literature except those specifically modified for the in silico analysis the sources of the model parameters are summarized in supplementary material 1 the in silico experiments were as follows 2 1 ground cover variations two different ground covers gc were compared on a high density 408 trees ha 1 olive orchard a gc of 40 gc40 and a gc of 20 gc20 the ground cover was defined as the projected shadow of the tree crown when the sun is at noon the simulations explored the effect of a pruning event on the relationship between œàstem at noon and rswc for each gc the rswc was changed from field capacity to permanent wilting point the same weather conditions were used for all the imposed rswcs the canopy parameters except the gc values were obtained from iniesta et al 2009 whilst root distribution was adapted from moriana 2001 parameters used for the two soil textures were obtained from campbell and norman 1998 the soil depth was 1 5 m the rest of the parameters required to run the model were obtained from garc√≠a tejera et al 2017a the weather conditions used were those of a clear summer day doy 234 the year 2014 simulations were performed on two soil textures sandy and clayey 2 2 effect of stomata sensitivity to stem water potential changes stomatal sensitivity to œàp was varied through modifications of two parameters in the model of tuzet et al 2003 namely the water potential that reduce gs to half œàcrit and the sensitivity of gs to œàp changes sf the values of the modified parameters are included in table 1 in the simulations the relationship between t and œàstem was compared on a clear summer day at different rswc and for two plants with distinct stomatal conductance sensitivities to the water potential one of high sensitivity hs in which œàcrit 1 2 mpa and sf 2 3 mpa 1 and one of low sensitivity ls in which œàcrit 2 6 mpa and sf 4 9 mpa 1 as in experiment 2 1 the in silico analysis was performed changing the rswc from field capacity to permanent wilting point using the same weather conditions for each value of rswc in both treatments the ra la 4 79 the weather conditions were the same as in experiment 2 1 soil texture parameters were those for a sandy soil campbell and norman 1998 and soil depth was 1 5 m 2 3 root distribution and pre dawn water potentials the changes in œàpd due to variations in root distribution and soil water content were analyzed to do so the proportion of roots in each soil compartment and soil layer was changed while total root biomass was maintained the region of soil influenced by the wet bulb fwet was changed from field capacity rswc 1 to 0 25 of rswc while the rest of the soil fdry was set at 0 1 of rswc soil conditions were the same as in experiment 2 2 namely sandy soil of 1 5 m depth the weather conditions used were those of a spring day doy 149 2 4 irrigation scheduling using a common stem water potential two olive orchards with different tree densities were compared super high density shd 1666 tree ha 1 and high density hd 408 tree ha 1 data inputs for the shd were obtained from garc√≠a tejera et al 2017a the root to leaf area ratio ra la was different in both orchards with the hd having a higher ra la than the shd table 1 irrigation in both shd and hd was 1 14 mm h 1 irrigation scheduling was established using a threshold midday œàstem 2 mpa in accordance with ahumada orellana et al 2019 whenever œàstem fell below the threshold during the simulation irrigation was triggered for 10 h thus applying 11 4 mm per irrigation event the simulation period ranged from doy 127 may 1st to doy 274 october 1st at the beginning of the simulation the soil was assumed to be at field capacity soil depth was 1 5 m with a sandy loam texture data for the soil characteristics were obtained from campbell and norman 1998 3 results 3 1 simulation 2 1 different ground covers fig 2 show the effect of different groundcovers on the relationship between œàstem at noon and the rswc the gc40 treatment presented a lower œàstem for the same rswc when compared to gc20 however the magnitude of the differences between the treatments was not the same for the two soil textures considered in the sandy soil there was a steeper decline in œàstem in gc40 compared with gc20 as the rswc was reduced in the clayey soil the difference throughout the rswc range was maintained in both treatments but gc20 always presented a higher œàstem the root area for both treatments was the same the larger ra la table 1 in gc20 was the consequence of a reduction in leaf area 3 2 simulation 2 2 stomatal sensitivity to œàp the response of two stomatal behaviors under water stress is presented in fig 3 each point represents the t œàstem relationship for an rswc value the hs plant presented a lower t at the initial point when the soil was at field capacity the transpiration demand imposed during this experiment was high with a reference evapotranspiration of around 6 mm day 1 and a temperature at noon of over 30 c under such weather conditions even for a soil entirely at field capacity the water potential drop was enough to affect stomatal conductance in the hs therefore t was reduced with respect to the ls the higher gs sensitivity of the hs also influenced the initial œàstem in the ls plant at field capacity the œàstem was 1 5 mpa whilst in the hs it was 1 mpa during the simulation the two plants had different t but the t œàstem relation was linear however at a œàstem below 2 5 mpa t remained constant in the hs treatment in this treatment when œàstem 2 5 mpa gs reached its minimum value at this point any further decline in the rswc and hence œàstem did not modify gs with t remaining constant 3 3 simulation 2 3 variation in predawn water potential fig 4 shows how the water available in the soil and the root distribution profiles affected œàpd the rswc in the alley was set to 0 1 in all the simulations mimicking a dry situation the changes in water content were applied only to the wet compartment fwet as the soil dried the œàpd went down œàpd passed from 0 03 mpa when the rswc in fwet 1 to 0 6 mpa when the rswc in fwet 0 25 at the maximum fraction of roots the variations in œàpd due to changes in the root distribution became significant when rswc 0 25 when the rswc in fwet was at 0 25 the difference between the highest and the lowest root fraction was 0 2 mpa 3 4 simulation 2 4 irrigation scheduling with a common œàstem the simulated œàstem at noon is shown in fig 5 during june july and august doy 152 to 243 deviations of the simulated œàstem from the threshold dashed line in fig 5 were observed the minimum œàstem during the simulation period was 2 6 mpa in hd and 3 6 mpa in shd the number of times for the thresholds being exceeded was greater in shd than in hd consequently the cumulative œàstem below the threshold was 50 5 mpa in the shd whereas for the hd was 26 7 mpa fig 6 shows the cumulative irrigation in the hd and shd treatments despite the higher cumulative œàstem for shd the total amount of water applied in this orchard was greater than in the hd with respective values of 216 mm and 148 mm fig 6 this difference was only due to a higher number of irrigation events in shd since the volume of water applied in each irrigation event was the same in both treatments although the œàstem threshold was set to avoid plant stress significant differences in t with respect to a well watered tree were observed fig 7 fig 7 shows the cumulative difference in t between the simulations presented in section 2 4 and the same tree with the soil always at field capacity i e at its potential t it can be seen how the trees were under water stress in both cases however the shd presented a greater difference with a minimum value of 370 mm compared with the 247 mm in hd these results are in accordance with the larger deviations from the œàstem threshold observed in fig 5 for shd 4 discussion 4 1 effect of variation on the resistances r the r is the result of the soil and plant characteristics campbell 1985 it is the sum of several resistances that form the water path from the soil to the atmosphere through the plant the soil resistance which includes the water movement from the midpoint between two roots towards the rhizosphere gardner 1960 the radial root resistance which represents the radial movement of water from the rhizosphere towards the xylem in a composite transport meaning that water can move through apoplastic or symplastic pathways steudle and peterson 1998 and the xylem resistance which is defined by the tree hydraulic architecture pockman and sperry 2000 tyree and ewers 1991 the importance that each of them plays on r depends on the environmental and plant conditions sperry et al 1998 tyree and zimmermann 2002c during periods of drought the ra la and the soil texture will regulate whether the limiting path for water transport will be the xylem or the roots sperry et al 1998 2002 the model does not simulate changes in xylem resistance by cavitation but it does include variations in root including the rhizosphere resistance during drought using the approach of bristow et al 1984 the effect of cavitation on œàp has recently been questioned by dietrich et al 2018 who showed how a reduction of more than half of the xylem area did not affect œàp the absence of a cavitation effect on xylem resistance explains why there is a steep drop in œàstem for the sandy soil whilst in the clayey texture the œàstem is maintained until the rswc equals zero fig 2 for coarser textured soils and low ra la the roots are the bottle neck for water transport during drought as the soil texture becomes finer or the ra la increases the role of the xylem in transporting water becomes more important sperry et al 1998 these shifts in the main element that limits water transport can have implications beyond irrigation scheduling a breeding program whose main aim is to improve tree water status through more profuse root systems will have little advantage in areas with clayey soils in eq 1 we showed that r and t affect œàp and so changing r will necessarily alter œàp fig 2 for instance when we prune a tree we reduce the ra la modifying the plant s hydraulic architecture the result is an improvement of the plant water status higher œàp for the same weather and soil conditions li et al 2003 in fact trees tend to naturally modify r through changes in its hydraulic architecture the huber value mm2 xylem cross section g 1 leaves fresh weight varies among species and in branches of the same tree it is known that plants from dry environments have higher huber values than those from more humid ones even in the same tree lateral branches will be in worse hydraulic conditions than apical ones due to lower huber values tyree and zimmermann 2002c this variability in huber values within individuals tends to compensate for the larger paths on distal branches allowing them to be in better hydraulic conditions than laterals tyree and ewers 1991 the result is a more uniform œàp distribution throughout the tree root morphology plays a role too in tree œàp distribution tap or herringbone shapes induce significant differences in œàp throughout the root system and hence the plant doussan et al 1998 javaux et al 2013 with the magnitude of such differences mediated by the soil texture javaux et al 2008 even changes in root distributions associated with the presence of wet spots modify the final œàp observed ameglio et al 1999 hence œàp is not just a consequence of the soil water content or the evaporative demand but is also an expression of the interaction between the plant the soil and the environment 4 2 changes in œàcrit the œàp has been used to estimate t in plants that present a linear relation between the water potential and the transpiration chon√© 2001 garnier et al 1988 williams et al 2012 simulation 2 2 shows that a linear relationship between œàp and t exists but the slope of this relation is dependent on œàcrit fig 3 differences in œàcrit are quite common especially in vitis vinifera l levin et al 2019 the fact that the relationship between œàp and t is linear implies that r is independent on œàp and t however it was seen in simulation 2 1 that r changed when we modified the soil and the plant characteristics schultz 2003 observed how the slope of the linear relationship between t and leaf water potential differed between two grapevine cultivars due to their distinct plant sizes if the slope results from r and œàcrit there will be as many t œàp relations as possible r and œàcrit combinations thus the t œàp relation will be site specific and any extrapolation could lead to significant errors in the estimation of t using œàp the use of a common threshold to schedule irrigation in plants with different œàcrit can trigger irrigation even when the soil is at field capacity fig 3 shows how the midday œàstem on a clear day is lower for the hs than for the ls plant at maximum t if we set the irrigation threshold to avoid any stress based on hs water potential at field capacity we will trigger irrigation on ls even when there is enough water in the soil 4 3 predawn water potential as an indicator the predawn water potential œàpd is commonly used as a surrogate for the soil water potential richter 1997 ritchie and hinckley 1975 at night when the stomata are closed and t is negligible œàsoil is balanced with œàp kramer 1969 during the equilibrium process between œàsoil and œàp the roots connect the soil and the plant and the œàpd becomes an estimation of the portion of the soil perceived by the roots ameglio et al 1999 it is important to keep in mind the perceived by the root system part of the preceding sentence roots are unevenly distributed throughout the soil huang and eissenstat 2000 jackson et al 1996 especially under localized irrigation clothier and green 1997 klepper 1991 ameglio et al 1999 in an experiment with walnut juglans regia l demonstrated that œàpd is indeed a surrogate of œàsoil but weighted by the resistances of the roots and the soil fig 4 supports the work of ameglio et al 1999 the effect of the resistances is clear when a reduction of rswc in fwet produces a concomitant decline in œàpd for the same root distribution in the simulation the root resistance increased as we reduced the rswc in fwet this process also happens in the field the root system gradually increase its resistance during drought either through suberification of the exodermis or by loose contact between the root surface and the soil particles north and nobel 1992 1997a north and nobel 1997b the result is a decoupling of the roots from the soil in the driest areas gardner 1960 javaux et al 2008 sperry et al 1998 therefore the œàpd observed will represent the œàsoil of the wettest region the wet bulb in a drip irrigation system and not an average of the entire soil the practical consequences of using œàpd are not trivial fig 4 show how just a 10 of the root system is responsible for the high œàpd observed when the rswc in the wet bulb is as low as 50 of field capacity therefore when the wetted volume of soil becomes very small the ability to sustain transpiration during the day will be compromised even when œàpd values are close to field capacity the small fraction of wetted roots will be unable to provide enough water to satisfy the canopy demand finally it is important to bear in mind that the use of œàpd as a surrogate for soil water potential relies on the assumption of an equilibrium between plant and soil such equilibrium cannot be reached when the nights are either too short summer in northern latitudes or under weather conditions that induce significant nighttime transpiration rates richter 1997 4 4 practical implications of a common threshold the effect of using a common œàp threshold to schedule irrigation is shown in figs 5 7 despite having the same œàcrit soil characteristics and weather conditions setting a common œàp led to very different plant responses between the hd and shd orchards in experiment 2 4 we checked œàstem exactly at noon if œàstem values below the threshold happened later in the afternoon the irrigation was not triggered although this situation was common for both treatments it induced larger deviation from the thresholds in shd fig 5 in section 4 1 we discussed the effect of a changing r on œàp fig 2 showed that a reduced ra la will induce a steeper decay in œàstem as the soil dries particularly for coarser soil textures the shd had an ra la ratio 40 lower than the hd and the soil texture used for the simulations was a sandy loam table 1 hence the negative effect of not triggering irrigation was exacerbated in shd fig 5 moriana et al 2012 observed how setting a common irrigation threshold produced a higher water stress integral mpa day in trees with larger gc fractions especially in the deficit irrigation program in which the threshold was set at 2 mpa where the authors found that the treatments with a higher gc presented a larger reduction in growth and yield moriana et al 2012 the results obtained by moriana et al 2012 contrast with the conclusions of ahumada orellana et al 2019 who observed that a œàstem 2 mpa will keep trees at mild or no stress the differences found between the two studies exemplify the level of specificity of irrigation thresholds we have assumed that œàstem measurement was discrete like those obtained with a pressure chamber nevertheless continuous œàstem recording is possible stem psychrometers or the leaf pressure clamp allow for high frequency œàstem records coffey et al 1997 quick et al 2018 zimmermann et al 2008 the use of continuous œàstem recording will reduce the differences observed in fig 5 if the irrigation is triggered immediately after the œàstem threshold is surpassed however farms commonly have different irrigation blocks and water is delivered in irrigation water turns meaning that a lag will exist between the signal from the sensor and the system s availability to deliver water to the plant if the time elapsed between the triggering signal and the irrigation event is too long there will be no advantage in the use of a continuous system in the simulation the irrigation amount was not related to the soil water content this explains the higher number of irrigation events in shd fig 6 if the irrigation volume did not recover œàstem to a value below the threshold irrigation was triggered again the next day applying the same amount of water consequently despite the higher water use in shd the cumulative t was lower figs 6 and 7 the œàstem indicates when to trigger irrigation but not how much is needed jones 2004 to schedule irrigation œàp needs to be monitored together with the soil water content to know when to irrigate and how much water is required 5 conclusions the œàp has been widely used to schedule irrigation however it is important to bear in mind that the œàp observed in a plant is not only a function of the available water in the soil but is also an expression of the interactions of all the elements that conform the spac therefore the use of absolute thresholds to provide irrigation advice could induce significant errors in situations where the conditions are very different from the ones in which the œàp references were established the interpretation of œàp should be carried out inside the spac framework otherwise misleading conclusions might arise from interpreting the data solely based on the interaction between œàp and the water stress level in this regard the use of models like the one applied for the in silico experiments in this paper will help to separate the wheat from the chaff in summary the œàp responds not only to water shortage but also to other factors including cultivar environment soil type and the relationships between canopy and root system i e the resistances to water movement r hence the water potential thresholds to schedule irrigation are site specific any natural or anthropogenic modification of the ra la will induce changes in the relationship between t œàp and soil water content the same is true for plants with different œàcrit the œàpd is not a surrogate of the soil water potential but an integration of the soil explored and perceived by the entire root system i e it is an average œàsoil weighted by the resistances of the roots and the soil throughout the entire soil profile the soil water content and distribution the root area and its conductivity will determine the observed œàpd to schedule irrigation both œàp and the soil water content must be monitored to know when to trigger irrigation and how much water is needed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

10439,the water potential œàp has been widely used as an indicator of plant water status for irrigation management purposes the simple infrastructure needed for its measurement and its direct relation to basic plant physiological processes have contributed to the popularity of the methodology when used for irrigation scheduling it is commonly assumed that an unavoidable relationship exists between plant transpiration t soil water content and œàp nevertheless it is worth remembering that variations in œàp are not solely related to changes in soil water content but are also an expression of the interaction between the plant and its environment we used a soil plant atmosphere continuum spac model to highlight the importance of considering such interactions through a series of in silico experiments our analysis shows that evaporative demand the hydraulic architecture of the plant and the texture and depth of the soil play key roles in the final œàp observed to establish irrigation programs based on œàp without considering the environmental and plant factors that influence it can create the paradox of having a plant that suffers greater water stress even when high irrigation volumes are applied the conclusions from our in silico analysis provide some warnings that should be considered when using œàp to schedule irrigation keywords water potential irrigation irrigation management spac 1 introduction water potential œàp is probably the most widespread indicator used to monitor the water status of a plant but what is it exactly the œàp measures the energy status of the water in a system referred to as the energy of free and pure water campbell 1985 expressed another way it is the amount by which free gibbs energy changes when water in a system varies while pressure and temperature remain constant campbell and norman 1998 jones 2013 the œàp can be decomposed into pressure osmotic and gravity potentials each affecting the œàp in specific ways the osmotic potential refers to the osmotic pressure generated in a compartment with solutes like a cell separated from pure water by a semipermeable membrane the pressure potential refers to the difference in hydrostatic pressure from a reference and can be positive or negative tension finally the gravity potential often overlooked results from differences in height from the reference level i e to changes in the potential energy jones 2013 kramer 1969 for a more in depth description of œàp and its components the reader is encouraged to consult jones 2013 or kirkham 2004 the cohesion tension theory establishes that the difference in water potential between soil and atmosphere is the driving force for transpiration t tyree and zimmermann 2002b the catenary hypothesis of van den honert 1948 provides a useful framework to study the relation between transpiration t œàp and soil plant resistances r van den honert 1948 if capacitance is not considered œàp can be expressed as 1 œà p t r œà s o i l according to eq 1 the measured œàp will depend on the plant transpiration t on the soil water potential œàsoil and on the obstacles for the movement of water from the soil to the atmosphere through the plant i e on the resistance r to water movement changes in r are related to variations in the hydraulic architecture of the plant and in the physical properties of the soil sperry et al 1998 tyree and zimmermann 2002a low soil temperatures or dry conditions induce changes in root resistance that modify its uptake capacity bristow et al 1984 garcia tejera et al 2016 lopez bernal et al 2015 north and nobel 1997a xylem cavitation during stress reduces the number of conductive vessels and leads to increased trunk resistance pockman and sperry 2000 venturas et al 2017 at a macro scale changes in root or canopy morphology also alter r changes in root to shoot ratios have been observed in trees mokany et al 2006 for instance under water stress there is an increase in root to shoot ratios this plastic response alters the water supply roots and demand leaves relationship favoring the maintenance of a better plant water status during drought hsiao and xu 2000 one problem with eq 1 is that t and œàp are not independent a negative feedback response is well known between stomatal conductance gs and œàp affecting t buckley 2019 buckley et al 2003 tuzet et al 2003 any decline in œàp below a certain threshold or critical water potential will induce stomata closure and reduce t the sensitivity of the stomata to œàp has been used to classify plants as isohydric or anisohydric however the way that these two concepts are defined differs among authors for tardieu and simonneau 1998 the relationship between œàsoil and œàp at midday during drought defines the iso anisohydric behavior an isohydric plant will maintain a constant midday leaf water potential regardless of the œàsoil whilst in an anisohydric plant œàp will decline with œàsoil in contrast mart√≠nez vilalta et al 2014 propose use of the slope of the relationship between midday œàp and predawn œàp if the slope is less than 1 the plant will be isohydric and if it is higher than 1 it will be anisohydric mart√≠nez vilalta et al 2014 klein 2014 observed that iso anisohydric behavior represents a gradient rather than two sperate hydraulic states given the discrepancies in the definitions and the strong effect that environmental factors have on plant water relations hochberg et al 2018 proposed to abandon the iso anisohydric terminology and to go for a more fundamental framework based on the direct relation between gs and œàp in the present paper we will follow hochberg et al 2018 recommendation we have spoken about the sensitivity of the stomata to œàp decline but growth is the first process that is affected when œàp drops hsiao 1973 the different sensitivities of gs and growth to changes in œàp have been used to establish irrigation programs in situations where the objective is biomass production the goal is the maintenance of a high œàp keeping a high œàp ensures plant growth and avoids any photosynthesis limitation maximizing canopy size and radiation interception hsiao 1973 tardieu et al 2018 this strategy is typically used in annual crops where yield is a fraction of the biomass produced evans 1998 in tree crops and vines however economic returns are related to both biomass and crop quality fereres and soriano 2007 the induction of slight to moderate stresses at specific phenological stages through deficit irrigation programs has been shown to be positively related to fruit firmness and sugar concentration basile et al 2011 girona et al 2009 lopez et al 2012 the maintenance of a slight water stress allows control of excessive growth favoring an optimal light environment inside the canopy and improving the partitioning of carbohydrates to reproductive structures chalmers et al 1981 johnson and handley 2000 jones 2004 irrigation programs based on œàp use thresholds to trigger irrigation once the threshold is passed the irrigation system is triggered consequently the œàp needs to be monitored the most widely used methodology to measure œàp involves the use of a pressure chamber scholander et al 1965 in the pressure chamber technique a positive pressure is applied to an excised plant section inside a chamber until the liquid content of the sample is forced out at this point the applied pressure equals œàp boyer 1995 for irrigation management purposes the pressure chamber technique is used at different times of the day if the measurement is performed during the night when t is negligible the œàp can be used as a surrogate of œàsoil see eq 1 this is called the predawn water potential œàpd boyer 1995 on a clear day the minimum œàp is usually achieved at midday when the noon measurement is performed on sun exposed leaves the value obtained is the midday leaf water potential however if the leaf is covered with a plastic bag and sealed for enough time the leaf water potential equilibrates with the water potential of the stem giving the stem water potential œàstem levin 2019 given all of the above several questions arise if r influences the relationship between t and œàp what are the implications of changes in r through variations in soil texture or plant morphology how will plants with different œàcrit behave in the same environment what are the risks of using a discrete methodology to monitor œàp what implications does the use of midday or predawn water potential have for irrigation scheduling to answer these questions we used a soil plant atmosphere continuum spac model to perform a series of in silico virtual experiments the great advantage of using a model is that one of the variables that influence œàp can be varied while all the others can be held constant in this way it is possible to explore the complicated interactions between the several factors that define œàp thus the objective of the present paper is to show how the variables that influence œàp might affect irrigation programs based on the water potential 2 materials and methods the effect of changes in spac components on the relationship between t œàp and the relative soil water content rswc was studied through a series of in silico experiments simulations were performed using the spac model with a multi compartment solution garc√≠a tejera et al 2017b the model has been previously validated on olive trees at different levels of water stress showing its capacity to accurately simulate t and œàp garc√≠a tejera et al 2017a briefly the model simulates t and œàp using the catenary hypothesis van den honert 1948 in which the soil plant atmosphere system is viewed as a set of resistances either in parallel or in series the canopy is discretized into sun shade leaves depury and farquhar 1997 while the soil is divided vertically into different layers and split horizontally into two compartments the wet compartment fwet which will include the area influenced by the localized irrigation system and the dry compartment fdry which represents the rest of the soil these compartments allow characterization of heterogeneity in root length distribution and soil water content inherent to the use of localized irrigation systems regulation of stomatal conductance is simulated using the tuzet et al 2003 model which includes the effect of water potential changes on stomatal response the variability of root resistivity i e resistance to water uptake per unit root surface area to temperature and soil dryness is modeled on the basis of garcia tejera et al 2016 and bristow et al 1984 fig 1 shows a schematic representation of the model the leaf water potential in the model is calculated for each leaf class sun or shaded as 2

tree the weather conditions imposed were obtained from a weather station located in cordoba 37 86 n 4 80 w spain inputs for the model were obtained from the literature except those specifically modified for the in silico analysis the sources of the model parameters are summarized in supplementary material 1 the in silico experiments were as follows 2 1 ground cover variations two different ground covers gc were compared on a high density 408 trees ha 1 olive orchard a gc of 40 gc40 and a gc of 20 gc20 the ground cover was defined as the projected shadow of the tree crown when the sun is at noon the simulations explored the effect of a pruning event on the relationship between œàstem at noon and rswc for each gc the rswc was changed from field capacity to permanent wilting point the same weather conditions were used for all the imposed rswcs the canopy parameters except the gc values were obtained from iniesta et al 2009 whilst root distribution was adapted from moriana 2001 parameters used for the two soil textures were obtained from campbell and norman 1998 the soil depth was 1 5 m the rest of the parameters required to run the model were obtained from garc√≠a tejera et al 2017a the weather conditions used were those of a clear summer day doy 234 the year 2014 simulations were performed on two soil textures sandy and clayey 2 2 effect of stomata sensitivity to stem water potential changes stomatal sensitivity to œàp was varied through modifications of two parameters in the model of tuzet et al 2003 namely the water potential that reduce gs to half œàcrit and the sensitivity of gs to œàp changes sf the values of the modified parameters are included in table 1 in the simulations the relationship between t and œàstem was compared on a clear summer day at different rswc and for two plants with distinct stomatal conductance sensitivities to the water potential one of high sensitivity hs in which œàcrit 1 2 mpa and sf 2 3 mpa 1 and one of low sensitivity ls in which œàcrit 2 6 mpa and sf 4 9 mpa 1 as in experiment 2 1 the in silico analysis was performed changing the rswc from field capacity to permanent wilting point using the same weather conditions for each value of rswc in both treatments the ra la 4 79 the weather conditions were the same as in experiment 2 1 soil texture parameters were those for a sandy soil campbell and norman 1998 and soil depth was 1 5 m 2 3 root distribution and pre dawn water potentials the changes in œàpd due to variations in root distribution and soil water content were analyzed to do so the proportion of roots in each soil compartment and soil layer was changed while total root biomass was maintained the region of soil influenced by the wet bulb fwet was changed from field capacity rswc 1 to 0 25 of rswc while the rest of the soil fdry was set at 0 1 of rswc soil conditions were the same as in experiment 2 2 namely sandy soil of 1 5 m depth the weather conditions used were those of a spring day doy 149 2 4 irrigation scheduling using a common stem water potential two olive orchards with different tree densities were compared super high density shd 1666 tree ha 1 and high density hd 408 tree ha 1 data inputs for the shd were obtained from garc√≠a tejera et al 2017a the root to leaf area ratio ra la was different in both orchards with the hd having a higher ra la than the shd table 1 irrigation in both shd and hd was 1 14 mm h 1 irrigation scheduling was established using a threshold midday œàstem 2 mpa in accordance with ahumada orellana et al 2019 whenever œàstem fell below the threshold during the simulation irrigation was triggered for 10 h thus applying 11 4 mm per irrigation event the simulation period ranged from doy 127 may 1st to doy 274 october 1st at the beginning of the simulation the soil was assumed to be at field capacity soil depth was 1 5 m with a sandy loam texture data for the soil characteristics were obtained from campbell and norman 1998 3 results 3 1 simulation 2 1 different ground covers fig 2 show the effect of different groundcovers on the relationship between œàstem at noon and the rswc the gc40 treatment presented a lower œàstem for the same rswc when compared to gc20 however the magnitude of the differences between the treatments was not the same for the two soil textures considered in the sandy soil there was a steeper decline in œàstem in gc40 compared with gc20 as the rswc was reduced in the clayey soil the difference throughout the rswc range was maintained in both treatments but gc20 always presented a higher œàstem the root area for both treatments was the same the larger ra la table 1 in gc20 was the consequence of a reduction in leaf area 3 2 simulation 2 2 stomatal sensitivity to œàp the response of two stomatal behaviors under water stress is presented in fig 3 each point represents the t œàstem relationship for an rswc value the hs plant presented a lower t at the initial point when the soil was at field capacity the transpiration demand imposed during this experiment was high with a reference evapotranspiration of around 6 mm day 1 and a temperature at noon of over 30 c under such weather conditions even for a soil entirely at field capacity the water potential drop was enough to affect stomatal conductance in the hs therefore t was reduced with respect to the ls the higher gs sensitivity of the hs also influenced the initial œàstem in the ls plant at field capacity the œàstem was 1 5 mpa whilst in the hs it was 1 mpa during the simulation the two plants had different t but the t œàstem relation was linear however at a œàstem below 2 5 mpa t remained constant in the hs treatment in this treatment when œàstem 2 5 mpa gs reached its minimum value at this point any further decline in the rswc and hence œàstem did not modify gs with t remaining constant 3 3 simulation 2 3 variation in predawn water potential fig 4 shows how the water available in the soil and the root distribution profiles affected œàpd the rswc in the alley was set to 0 1 in all the simulations mimicking a dry situation the changes in water content were applied only to the wet compartment fwet as the soil dried the œàpd went down œàpd passed from 0 03 mpa when the rswc in fwet 1 to 0 6 mpa when the rswc in fwet 0 25 at the maximum fraction of roots the variations in œàpd due to changes in the root distribution became significant when rswc 0 25 when the rswc in fwet was at 0 25 the difference between the highest and the lowest root fraction was 0 2 mpa 3 4 simulation 2 4 irrigation scheduling with a common œàstem the simulated œàstem at noon is shown in fig 5 during june july and august doy 152 to 243 deviations of the simulated œàstem from the threshold dashed line in fig 5 were observed the minimum œàstem during the simulation period was 2 6 mpa in hd and 3 6 mpa in shd the number of times for the thresholds being exceeded was greater in shd than in hd consequently the cumulative œàstem below the threshold was 50 5 mpa in the shd whereas for the hd was 26 7 mpa fig 6 shows the cumulative irrigation in the hd and shd treatments despite the higher cumulative œàstem for shd the total amount of water applied in this orchard was greater than in the hd with respective values of 216 mm and 148 mm fig 6 this difference was only due to a higher number of irrigation events in shd since the volume of water applied in each irrigation event was the same in both treatments although the œàstem threshold was set to avoid plant stress significant differences in t with respect to a well watered tree were observed fig 7 fig 7 shows the cumulative difference in t between the simulations presented in section 2 4 and the same tree with the soil always at field capacity i e at its potential t it can be seen how the trees were under water stress in both cases however the shd presented a greater difference with a minimum value of 370 mm compared with the 247 mm in hd these results are in accordance with the larger deviations from the œàstem threshold observed in fig 5 for shd 4 discussion 4 1 effect of variation on the resistances r the r is the result of the soil and plant characteristics campbell 1985 it is the sum of several resistances that form the water path from the soil to the atmosphere through the plant the soil resistance which includes the water movement from the midpoint between two roots towards the rhizosphere gardner 1960 the radial root resistance which represents the radial movement of water from the rhizosphere towards the xylem in a composite transport meaning that water can move through apoplastic or symplastic pathways steudle and peterson 1998 and the xylem resistance which is defined by the tree hydraulic architecture pockman and sperry 2000 tyree and ewers 1991 the importance that each of them plays on r depends on the environmental and plant conditions sperry et al 1998 tyree and zimmermann 2002c during periods of drought the ra la and the soil texture will regulate whether the limiting path for water transport will be the xylem or the roots sperry et al 1998 2002 the model does not simulate changes in xylem resistance by cavitation but it does include variations in root including the rhizosphere resistance during drought using the approach of bristow et al 1984 the effect of cavitation on œàp has recently been questioned by dietrich et al 2018 who showed how a reduction of more than half of the xylem area did not affect œàp the absence of a cavitation effect on xylem resistance explains why there is a steep drop in œàstem for the sandy soil whilst in the clayey texture the œàstem is maintained until the rswc equals zero fig 2 for coarser textured soils and low ra la the roots are the bottle neck for water transport during drought as the soil texture becomes finer or the ra la increases the role of the xylem in transporting water becomes more important sperry et al 1998 these shifts in the main element that limits water transport can have implications beyond irrigation scheduling a breeding program whose main aim is to improve tree water status through more profuse root systems will have little advantage in areas with clayey soils in eq 1 we showed that r and t affect œàp and so changing r will necessarily alter œàp fig 2 for instance when we prune a tree we reduce the ra la modifying the plant s hydraulic architecture the result is an improvement of the plant water status higher œàp for the same weather and soil conditions li et al 2003 in fact trees tend to naturally modify r through changes in its hydraulic architecture the huber value mm2 xylem cross section g 1 leaves fresh weight varies among species and in branches of the same tree it is known that plants from dry environments have higher huber values than those from more humid ones even in the same tree lateral branches will be in worse hydraulic conditions than apical ones due to lower huber values tyree and zimmermann 2002c this variability in huber values within individuals tends to compensate for the larger paths on distal branches allowing them to be in better hydraulic conditions than laterals tyree and ewers 1991 the result is a more uniform œàp distribution throughout the tree root morphology plays a role too in tree œàp distribution tap or herringbone shapes induce significant differences in œàp throughout the root system and hence the plant doussan et al 1998 javaux et al 2013 with the magnitude of such differences mediated by the soil texture javaux et al 2008 even changes in root distributions associated with the presence of wet spots modify the final œàp observed ameglio et al 1999 hence œàp is not just a consequence of the soil water content or the evaporative demand but is also an expression of the interaction between the plant the soil and the environment 4 2 changes in œàcrit the œàp has been used to estimate t in plants that present a linear relation between the water potential and the transpiration chon√© 2001 garnier et al 1988 williams et al 2012 simulation 2 2 shows that a linear relationship between œàp and t exists but the slope of this relation is dependent on œàcrit fig 3 differences in œàcrit are quite common especially in vitis vinifera l levin et al 2019 the fact that the relationship between œàp and t is linear implies that r is independent on œàp and t however it was seen in simulation 2 1 that r changed when we modified the soil and the plant characteristics schultz 2003 observed how the slope of the linear relationship between t and leaf water potential differed between two grapevine cultivars due to their distinct plant sizes if the slope results from r and œàcrit there will be as many t œàp relations as possible r and œàcrit combinations thus the t œàp relation will be site specific and any extrapolation could lead to significant errors in the estimation of t using œàp the use of a common threshold to schedule irrigation in plants with different œàcrit can trigger irrigation even when the soil is at field capacity fig 3 shows how the midday œàstem on a clear day is lower for the hs than for the ls plant at maximum t if we set the irrigation threshold to avoid any stress based on hs water potential at field capacity we will trigger irrigation on ls even when there is enough water in the soil 4 3 predawn water potential as an indicator the predawn water potential œàpd is commonly used as a surrogate for the soil water potential richter 1997 ritchie and hinckley 1975 at night when the stomata are closed and t is negligible œàsoil is balanced with œàp kramer 1969 during the equilibrium process between œàsoil and œàp the roots connect the soil and the plant and the œàpd becomes an estimation of the portion of the soil perceived by the roots ameglio et al 1999 it is important to keep in mind the perceived by the root system part of the preceding sentence roots are unevenly distributed throughout the soil huang and eissenstat 2000 jackson et al 1996 especially under localized irrigation clothier and green 1997 klepper 1991 ameglio et al 1999 in an experiment with walnut juglans regia l demonstrated that œàpd is indeed a surrogate of œàsoil but weighted by the resistances of the roots and the soil fig 4 supports the work of ameglio et al 1999 the effect of the resistances is clear when a reduction of rswc in fwet produces a concomitant decline in œàpd for the same root distribution in the simulation the root resistance increased as we reduced the rswc in fwet this process also happens in the field the root system gradually increase its resistance during drought either through suberification of the exodermis or by loose contact between the root surface and the soil particles north and nobel 1992 1997a north and nobel 1997b the result is a decoupling of the roots from the soil in the driest areas gardner 1960 javaux et al 2008 sperry et al 1998 therefore the œàpd observed will represent the œàsoil of the wettest region the wet bulb in a drip irrigation system and not an average of the entire soil the practical consequences of using œàpd are not trivial fig 4 show how just a 10 of the root system is responsible for the high œàpd observed when the rswc in the wet bulb is as low as 50 of field capacity therefore when the wetted volume of soil becomes very small the ability to sustain transpiration during the day will be compromised even when œàpd values are close to field capacity the small fraction of wetted roots will be unable to provide enough water to satisfy the canopy demand finally it is important to bear in mind that the use of œàpd as a surrogate for soil water potential relies on the assumption of an equilibrium between plant and soil such equilibrium cannot be reached when the nights are either too short summer in northern latitudes or under weather conditions that induce significant nighttime transpiration rates richter 1997 4 4 practical implications of a common threshold the effect of using a common œàp threshold to schedule irrigation is shown in figs 5 7 despite having the same œàcrit soil characteristics and weather conditions setting a common œàp led to very different plant responses between the hd and shd orchards in experiment 2 4 we checked œàstem exactly at noon if œàstem values below the threshold happened later in the afternoon the irrigation was not triggered although this situation was common for both treatments it induced larger deviation from the thresholds in shd fig 5 in section 4 1 we discussed the effect of a changing r on œàp fig 2 showed that a reduced ra la will induce a steeper decay in œàstem as the soil dries particularly for coarser soil textures the shd had an ra la ratio 40 lower than the hd and the soil texture used for the simulations was a sandy loam table 1 hence the negative effect of not triggering irrigation was exacerbated in shd fig 5 moriana et al 2012 observed how setting a common irrigation threshold produced a higher water stress integral mpa day in trees with larger gc fractions especially in the deficit irrigation program in which the threshold was set at 2 mpa where the authors found that the treatments with a higher gc presented a larger reduction in growth and yield moriana et al 2012 the results obtained by moriana et al 2012 contrast with the conclusions of ahumada orellana et al 2019 who observed that a œàstem 2 mpa will keep trees at mild or no stress the differences found between the two studies exemplify the level of specificity of irrigation thresholds we have assumed that œàstem measurement was discrete like those obtained with a pressure chamber nevertheless continuous œàstem recording is possible stem psychrometers or the leaf pressure clamp allow for high frequency œàstem records coffey et al 1997 quick et al 2018 zimmermann et al 2008 the use of continuous œàstem recording will reduce the differences observed in fig 5 if the irrigation is triggered immediately after the œàstem threshold is surpassed however farms commonly have different irrigation blocks and water is delivered in irrigation water turns meaning that a lag will exist between the signal from the sensor and the system s availability to deliver water to the plant if the time elapsed between the triggering signal and the irrigation event is too long there will be no advantage in the use of a continuous system in the simulation the irrigation amount was not related to the soil water content this explains the higher number of irrigation events in shd fig 6 if the irrigation volume did not recover œàstem to a value below the threshold irrigation was triggered again the next day applying the same amount of water consequently despite the higher water use in shd the cumulative t was lower figs 6 and 7 the œàstem indicates when to trigger irrigation but not how much is needed jones 2004 to schedule irrigation œàp needs to be monitored together with the soil water content to know when to irrigate and how much water is required 5 conclusions the œàp has been widely used to schedule irrigation however it is important to bear in mind that the œàp observed in a plant is not only a function of the available water in the soil but is also an expression of the interactions of all the elements that conform the spac therefore the use of absolute thresholds to provide irrigation advice could induce significant errors in situations where the conditions are very different from the ones in which the œàp references were established the interpretation of œàp should be carried out inside the spac framework otherwise misleading conclusions might arise from interpreting the data solely based on the interaction between œàp and the water stress level in this regard the use of models like the one applied for the in silico experiments in this paper will help to separate the wheat from the chaff in summary the œàp responds not only to water shortage but also to other factors including cultivar environment soil type and the relationships between canopy and root system i e the resistances to water movement r hence the water potential thresholds to schedule irrigation are site specific any natural or anthropogenic modification of the ra la will induce changes in the relationship between t œàp and soil water content the same is true for plants with different œàcrit the œàpd is not a surrogate of the soil water potential but an integration of the soil explored and perceived by the entire root system i e it is an average œàsoil weighted by the resistances of the roots and the soil throughout the entire soil profile the soil water content and distribution the root area and its conductivity will determine the observed œàpd to schedule irrigation both œàp and the soil water content must be monitored to know when to trigger irrigation and how much water is needed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that
