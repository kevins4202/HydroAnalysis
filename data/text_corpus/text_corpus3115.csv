the transport experiments of polystyrene nanoparticles psnps in quartz sand qs mixed with three kinds of clay minerals are conducted to investigate the effects of kaolinite kl montmorillonite mt and illite il on the mobility of psnps in groundwater two dimensional 2d distributions of dlvo interaction energy are calculated to quantify the interactions between psnps and three kinds of clay minerals the critical ionic strengths cis of psnps kl psnps mt and psnps il are 17 0 mm 19 3 mm and 21 0 mm respectively experimental results suggest kl has the strongest inhibition effect on the mobility of psnps followed by mt and il simultaneously the change of ionic strength can alter the surface charge of psnps and clay minerals thus affecting the interaction energy experimental and model results indicate both the deposition rate coefficient k and maximum deposition s max linearly decrease with the logarithm of the dlvo energy barrier while the mass recovery rate of psnps rm exponentially increases with the logarithm of the dlvo energy barrier therefore the mobility and associated kinetic parameters of psnps in complex porous media containing clay minerals can be predicted by 2d

straining effects ph and ionic strength had apparent influences on the mobility of nanoplastics different kinds of clay have different physicochemical properties and different clay minerals have different isomorphic substitutions on the base surface protonation and deprotonation properties and the charge density at the edge are also different hussain et al 1996 lagaly and ziesmer 2003 garcía garcía et al 2007 zhou et al 2012 the effects of clay minerals on the transport of nano plastics are very limited therefore it is very important to study the effects of different kinds of clay minerals on the mobility of nano plastics in porous media investigate associated mechanisms and predict the kinetic parameters related to psnps mobility in porous media containing clay minerals this study focuses on the effects of three kinds of clay minerals kaolinite kl montmorillonite mt and illite il in mixed porous media qs and clay mineral on the transport of polystyrene nanoparticles psnps which is one of the most abundant types of plastic contaminants in the subsurface environment de haan et al 2019 the objectives of this research are as follows 1 calculate the two dimensional 2d distribution of dlvo interaction energy between psnps and clay minerals and obtain the critical ionic strength cis related to the mobility of psnps in porous media 2 determine the effects of clay types the mass fraction of clay minerals and ionic strength on the mobility of psnps 3 build the transport model of psnps in porous media mixed with clay minerals quantify the mathematical relationships between transport kinetic parameters and the value of dlvo energy barrier 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental material psnps qs kl 95 mt 99 il 95 and other materials are purchased from guangzhou yuewan environmental technology co ltd the grain size of psnps is 80 5 nm the concentration of the psnps solution was 0 1 g ml and the nanoparticles are homogeneously dispersed by sonication for 30 min before being diluted to the required concentration qs with a particle size of 0 60 0 85 mm is soaked in tap water and 10 nitric acid to remove metal oxides and other impurities from qs then rinsed thoroughly with deionized water until qs is ph neutral and finally dried in an oven at 105 c the grain sizes of kl mt il all are in micrometer size qs and clay particles are glued to the sample stage by means of conductive double sided tape sprayed with gold to dry and then placed in a scanning electron microscope sem echcomp tm3030 for imaging energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx edx1800rohs was carried out on the clay minerals to determine the main components of the different clay minerals the specific surface areas of three clay minerals are measured by the bet method the zeta potentials of psnps qs kl mt il and the particle size of psnps are determined under different conditions using a malvern laser particle sizer zetasiser nono zs90 2 2 dlvo interaction energy the 2d distributions of the interaction energy between psnps and clay minerals are calculated based on dlvo theory details about the calculation of the 2d distribution of dlvo interaction energy are presented in supplementary material 2 3 psnps transport experiment qs are mixed with clay minerals kl mt il and packed into the column length is 20 cm internal diameter is 2 5 cm according to the clay mass percentage of 1 3 in natural porous media bayat et al 2015 lu et al 2017 the average porosity of the porous media packed in the column is 0 3 and hydraulic conductivity is 10 9 cm min the column is fixed with a 2000 mesh stainless steel screen at both ends to avoid medium loss and ensure a uniform flow of water previous studies suggested that the rate of particle deposition is greater for up flow than down flow direction chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 therefore the up flow direction is selected for experiments to obtain high deposition rates deionized water is injected into the column using a peristaltic pump bt100 2 j baoding lange china at a flow rate of 0 067 ml s making the column to be saturated with deionized water for 12 h fig 1 a non reactive tracer 1 mm kbr test is conducted before the column experiment to determine the dispersity of porous media packed in the column after the tracer experiment the column is flushed with 50 pvs of deionized water followed by 9 pvs of the corresponding background solution afterward 2 pvs of psnps solution are injected into the column followed by 5 pvs of background solution to flush the column simultaneously the effluent is continuously sampled using an automatic collector experimental conditions are illustrated in tables s1 s3 2 4 psnps transport model various models were proposed to investigate the cotransport of colloids in porous media under complex conditions such as ionic strength ph gravity etc in which complex interactions and aggregation were considered chrysikopoulos et al 2017 katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2014 2015 2016 and 2021 the transport of psnps in porous media containing clay minerals is simulated by a single point kinetic model tan et al 2021 wu et al 2021

the tracer experiment which is used to fit the values of the parameters k and smax 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of psnps qs and lt the sem images of kl mt and il are shown in fig s1a f sem results suggest kl mt and il are irregularly shaped particles with a rough surface the intergranular structure of kl is loose and worm like figs s1a and b mt particles are leaf shaped resembling pieces of paper torn into small pieces figs s1c and d and the particles of il are irregularly scaled figs s1e and f the edx results of kl are presented in figs s2a and b which show that the main elements are silicon and aluminum the main elements of mt are silicon and aluminum and contains small amounts of sodium magnesium and calcium figs s2c and d the main elements of il also are silicon and aluminum and contain small amounts of potassium and sodium figs s2e and f edx analysis indicates exchangeable cation for mt is less than that for kl and il which is consistent with the results obtained by previous study bayat et al 2015 zeta potentials of three kinds of clay minerals and hydrodynamic diameter of psnps under different ionic strengths are illustrated in figs s3a f 3 2 2d distribution of dlvo interaction energy 2d distribution of dlvo interaction energy between psnps and kl psnps and mt psnps and il psnps and qs are presented in figs 2 a d the dlvo curves at ionic strength 1 mm are shown in figs s4a d as can be seen from the 2d distribution of dlvo interaction energy in figs 2a d with the decrease of h separation distance the interaction energy increases at first and then decreases and then increases the change of dlvo energy barrier with ionic strength is obtained based on the 2d distribution of dlvo interaction energy to determine the cis related to psnps aggregation adsorption and mobility in porous media it can be seen that the dlvo energy barrier decreases with ionic strength figs 3 a d the dlvo energy barrier of psnps kl reaches the lowest value and tends to be stable when ionic strength exceeds 17 0 mm indicating that the mobility of psnps is weakest under this condition when ionic strength reaches 17 0 mm the barrier of the dlvo interaction energy between psnps and kl decreases to the lowest value this phenomenon suggests the mobility of psnps is inhibited when ionic strength exceeds 17 0 mm cis similarly the cis values of psnps mt psnps il and psnps qs are19 3 mm 21 0 mm and 23 9 mm respectively the lower cis value indicates that psnps is more easily adsorbed on the surface of the medium so the cis results suggest the inhibition effect of kl on psnps mobility is larger than that of mt and il the cis value of dlvo interaction energy between psnps and qs is larger than the cis value of dlvo interaction energy between psnps and clay minerals indicating that clay minerals have a stronger inhibition effect on the mobility of psnps than qs as can be seen in figs s4a d under the same ionic strength 1 mm the dlvo energy barriers of psnps kl psnps mt and psnps il are almost the same which is lower than that of psnps qs which again indicates that clay minerals have a stronger inhibition effect on psnps mobility than that of qs in addition the dlvo energy trap of psnps kl is lower than that of psnps mt and psnps il suggesting that kl has the greatest inhibitory effect on psnps mobility followed by mt and il 3 3 psnps mobility under different conditions 3 3 1 mass fraction of clay minerals the btcs of psnps under the different mass fractions of clay minerals are shown in figs 4 a c and e as can be seen in figs 4a c and e the transport of psnps is affected when qs are mixed with clay minerals kl mt il the peak value of c c0 of btc reaches 0 76 and the mass recovery rate of psnps reaches 62 16 when the porous media packed in the column is single qs without any clay minerals however when the mass fractions of kl increase to 1 2 3 and 3 5 corresponding peak values of c c0 are 0 52 0 44 0 38 and 0 31 respectively table s1 the mass recovery rates of psnps decrease to 43 8 41 8 27 8 and 25 0 respectively when the mass fractions of mt are 1 2 3 and 3 5 the peak values of c c0 become 0 60 0 53 0 45 and 0 37 and the mass recovery rates of psnps are 55 0 49 7 32 5 and 28 7 respectively table s2 as the mass fractions of il are 1 2 3 and 3 5 corresponding peak values of c c0 become 0 70 0 63 0 58 and 0 50 and the mass recovery rates of psnps are 61 2 60 8 46 0 and 39 8 respectively table s3 experimental results suggest three kinds of clay minerals all inhibited the mobility of psnps in porous media and kl has the greatest inhibition effect compared with mt and il which are consistent with the predictions based on the 2d distribution of dlvo interaction energy based on experimental results and previous studies lagaly et al 2006 kriaa et al 2009 zhou et al 2012 the inhibitory effect of clay minerals on the transport of psnps is mainly attributed to the presence of positively charged edge positions on the surface of clay minerals the permanent charges of the silicate layers are generated by isomeric substitution and the degree of substitution varies from layer to layer to a certain extent lagaly and ziesmer 2003 kriaa et al 2009 zhou et al 2012 therefore the interlayer cation density also varies depending on the interlayer space and can vary in the direction parallel to the layers heterogeneous charge distribution the presence of aluminum and silanol groups at the edges of these layers is positively charged at low ph and negatively charged at high ph thus clay minerals contain many amphiphilic sites such as octahedral al oh sites at the fractured edges of the crystal structure and the exposed end hydroxyl planes tombacz and szekeres 2004 zhou et al 2012 according to previous studies kl has a ph pzc value of 6 6 5 tombacz and szekeres 2006 mt has a ph pzc value of about 6 5 tombacz and szekeres 2004 while il has a ph pzc value of only 2 5 hussain et al 1996 as a result at this experimental condition ph 6 0 the net charge of kl and mt are negative but most of the edge sites are positively charged compared to il these positively charged sites of kl and mt would provide favorable deposition sites for negatively charged psnps and significantly inhibit their transport however the inhibitory effect of kl on psnps is significantly greater than that of mt figs 4a and c this is because the edge area of kl accounts for 20 30 of the total surface area while the edge area of mt is less than 1 of the total surface area wan and tokunaga 2002 therefore kl has more positively charged marginal positions than mt in addition clay minerals can also inhibit the migration of psnps by affecting the flow path of psnps in porous media the grain size of these clay minerals 80 μm is much smaller than that of qs 0 425 0 500 mm when qs and clay particles are densely packed the pore space decreases and more zone with low flow velocity or flow stagnation are created therefore the presence of clay minerals can alter the flow channel by creating narrower pore throats qi et al 2014 however the transport of psnps is significantly inhibited when the mass fraction of il is 3 5 while the inhibitory effect is not obvious when the mass fraction of il is 1 it can be concluded that the inhibition effect may not be dominant under the condition of the same particle size in summary the inhibition effect of clay minerals on psnps mobility is mainly caused by affecting the electrostatic interaction between psnps and the medium psnps transport in porous media containing clay minerals is simulated by the transport model based on single point deposition kinetics with good effect r2 0 84 the simulation results are consistent with experimental results tables s1 s3 as shown in figs s5 s7 when the mass fraction of kl increases from 0 to 3 5 the value of k increases from 2 1 10 2 min 1 to 1 23 10 1 min 1 and the value of s max increases from 3 63 mg g 1 to 11 7 mg g 1 as the mass fraction of mt increases from 0 to 3 5 k increases from 2 1 10 2 min 1 to 1 01 10 1 min 1 and s max increases from 3 63 mg g 1 to 10 2 mg g 1 similarly as the mass fraction of il increases from 0 to 3 5 k increases from 2 1 10 2 min 1 to 1 03 10 1 min 1 and s max increases from 3 63 mg g 1 to 10 2 mg g 1 it can be seen that the psnps deposition is enhanced under the high mass fraction of clay and the maximum deposition concentration on the media surface also increases 3 3 2 ionic strength the btcs of psnps under different ionic strengths are shown in figs 4b d and f the peak value of c c0 of btcs and mass recovery rate of psnps decrease with the ionic strength of background solution for psnps transport in qs kl porous media the corresponding peak value of c c0 of btcs decreases from 0 63 to 0 01 when the ionic strength increases from 0 mm to 20 mm na for psnps transport in qs mt porous media the corresponding peak value of c c0 of btcs decreases from 0 65 to 0 01 when the ionic strength increases from 0 mm to 20 mm na for psnps transport in qs il porous media the corresponding peak value of c c0 of btcs decreases from 0 73 to 0 02 when the ionic strength increases from 0 mm to 20 mm na in addition ionic strength na also has an apparent influence on the mass fraction of psnps in qs kl qs mt and qs il table s1 s3 when the mass fraction of clay minerals and other conditions are constant the charge effect and physical strain at the edge sites can be neglected lu et al 2021 moreover the surface change of psnps and porous media is changed with ionic strength fig s3a e these results indicate that ionic strength is an important factor controlling the mobility of psnps as the ionic strength increases na is electrically neutralized with negatively charged media and psnps resulting in weaker electrostatic repulsion between psnps and media and easier deposition on the media surface under the same condition of ionic strength the inhibition effect of il on the mobility of psnps is weaker than that of mt the inhibition effect of mt on the mobility of psnps is weaker than that of kl which is consistent with the results of the 2d distribution of dlvo interaction energy the edges of kl and mt are positively charged and the edges of il are negatively charged therefore the edges of kl and mt provide favorable deposition sites for psnps similarly because the percentage of the total area of the kl edge region is larger than that of mt the inhibition effect of kl on psnps mobility is greater than that of mt the transport of psnps in porous media containing clay minerals under different ionic strengths is simulated by the transport model based on single point deposition kinetics which is consistent with experimental results r2 80 when ionic strength increases from 0 mm to 20 mm in the qs kl column k increases from 3 11 10 2 min 1 to 1 54 10 1 min 1 and s max increases from 6 96 mg g 1 to 18 6 mg g 1 as ionic strength increases from 0 mm to 20 mm in qs mt porous media k increases from 2 71 10 2 min 1 to 1 43 10 1 min 1 and s max increases from 6 61 mg g 1 to 13 3 mg g 1 when ionic strength increases from 0 mm to 20 mm in qs il porous media k increases from 2 31 10 2 min 1 to 1 09 10 1 min 1 and s max increases from 5 00 mg g 1 to 11 0 mg g 1 according to model results the higher ionic strength leads to a stronger inhibition effect on the psnps mobility 3 3 3 the relationship between transport kinetic parameters and dlvo interaction energy an integrated dlvo energy barrier is calculated to analyze the relationship between transport kinetic parameters of psnps in porous media containing clay minerals and dlvo interaction energy 3 b i d b p s q s b p c c m where bid represents the integrated value of dlvo energy barriers kt qs represents the mass fraction of qs in porous media cm represents the mass fraction of clay minerals in porous media bps represents the barrier of the dlvo interaction energy between psnps and qs kt bpc represents the barrier of the dlvo interaction energy between psnps and clay minerals bpk bpm or bpi kt bpk represents the barrier of the dlvo interaction energy between psnps and kl kt bpm represents the barrier of the dlvo interaction energy between psnps and mt kt bpi represents the barrier of the dlvo interaction energy between psnps and il kt regression analysis is conducted to investigate the relationship between the integrated dlvo energy barrier and kinetic parameters related to psnps mobility the obtained equations of k s max and r m related to psnps mobility are illustrated in table s4 regression analysis shows that both k and s max linearly decrease with the logarithm of the integrated value of the dlvo energy barrier figs 5 a and b however the mass recovery rate of psnps nonlinearly increases with the logarithm of the integrated value of the dlvo energy barrier figs 5c and an exponential function appears between the mass recovery rate of psnps and the logarithm of the integrated value of the dlvo energy barrier the determination coefficients r2 of fitted equations of k and the mass recovery rate of psnps both exceed 0 8 which is higher than r2 0 695 of the fitted equation of s max table s4 these results suggest the 2d distribution of dlvo interaction energy has a significant ability to quantify and predict psnps transport and related kinetic parameters in natural porous media containing clay minerals the first order deposition term is much more simplistic than what is nicely worked out by previous cotransport models chrysikopoulos et al 2017 katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2014 2015 2016 and 2021 however the aim of our research is to investigate the accurate relationship between kinetic parameters and dlvo barriers and the critical ionic strengths na ca2 related to psnps mobility in the multicomponent porous media results suggest the surfaces of dlvo interaction energy obtained in this study can be used to predict the kinetic parameters related to psnps mobility in porous media containing clay minerals results suggest the transport process of psnps in the multicomponent porous media can be well simulated by the psnps transport model based on single point kinetics significantly k s max and mass recovery rate of psnps are highly correlated with dlvo energy barriers therefore the surfaces of dlvo interaction energy obtained in this study can be used to predict the kinetic parameters related to psnps mobility in porous media containing clay minerals even though the porous media consists of quartz sand and clay mineral an important step is taken in predicting the transport ability of microplastics in the multicomponent porous media by dlvo moreover the application of fe2o3 and al2o3 that has positive charges on the surface considering filtration theory remobilization collector grain size size dependent dispersivity and flow rates will be conducted in our future work and we believe more interesting and significant can be obtained 4 conclusions experimental and model results suggest that clay minerals have an important influence on the mobility of psnps in porous media the 2d distribution of dlvo interaction energy indicates that kl has the strongest inhibition effect on the mobility of psnps followed by mt and il which is consistent with experimental results based on the characterization of the three kinds of clay minerals the presence of clay minerals leads to more psnps retention due to their rough and unsmooth surfaces the edges of kl and mt are positively charged and the edges of il are negatively charged therefore kl and mt can provide more deposition sites for psnps meanwhile the percentage of the total area of kl edge region is larger than that of mt resulting in a greater inhibition effect on psnps transport by kl simultaneously the presence of clay minerals can alter the flow channel by creating narrower pore throats which inhibit the mobility of psnps the 2d distribution of dlvo interaction energy suggests the cis values of psnps kl psnps mt and psnps il are 17 0 mm 19 3 mm and 21 0 mm respectively moreover both parameters k and s max linearly decrease with the logarithm of the integrated value of the dlvo energy barrier while the mass recovery rate of psnps rm exponentially increases with the logarithm of the integrated value of the dlvo energy barrier the effects of clay type mass fraction of clay minerals and ionic strength on the mobility of psnp are systematically investigated in this study which can provide theoretical and technical

cm according to the clay mass percentage of 1 3 in natural porous media bayat et al 2015 lu et al 2017 the average porosity of the porous media packed in the column is 0 3 and hydraulic conductivity is 10 9 cm min the column is fixed with a 2000 mesh stainless steel screen at both ends to avoid medium loss and ensure a uniform flow of water previous studies suggested that the rate of particle deposition is greater for up flow than down flow direction chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 therefore the up flow direction is selected for experiments to obtain high deposition rates deionized water is injected into the column using a peristaltic pump bt100 2 j baoding lange china at a flow rate of 0 067 ml s making the column to be saturated with deionized water for 12 h fig 1 a non reactive tracer 1 mm kbr test is conducted before the column experiment to determine the dispersity of porous media packed in the column after the tracer experiment the column is flushed with 50 pvs of deionized water followed by 9 pvs of the corresponding background solution afterward 2 pvs of psnps solution are injected into the column followed by 5 pvs of background solution to flush the column simultaneously the effluent is continuously sampled using an automatic collector experimental conditions are illustrated in tables s1 s3 2 4 psnps transport model various models were proposed to investigate the cotransport of colloids in porous media under complex conditions such as ionic strength ph gravity etc in which complex interactions and aggregation were considered chrysikopoulos et al 2017 katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2014 2015 2016 and 2021 the transport of psnps in porous media containing clay minerals is simulated by a single point kinetic model tan et al 2021 wu et al 2021

the tracer experiment which is used to fit the values of the parameters k and smax 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of psnps qs and lt the sem images of kl mt and il are shown in fig s1a f sem results suggest kl mt and il are irregularly shaped particles with a rough surface the intergranular structure of kl is loose and worm like figs s1a and b mt particles are leaf shaped resembling pieces of paper torn into small pieces figs s1c and d and the particles of il are irregularly scaled figs s1e and f the edx results of kl are presented in figs s2a and b which show that the main elements are silicon and aluminum the main elements of mt are silicon and aluminum and contains small amounts of sodium magnesium and calcium figs s2c and d the main elements of il also are silicon and aluminum and contain small amounts of potassium and sodium figs s2e and f edx analysis indicates exchangeable cation for mt is less than that for kl and il which is consistent with the results obtained by previous study bayat et al 2015 zeta potentials of three kinds of clay minerals and hydrodynamic diameter of psnps under different ionic strengths are illustrated in figs s3a f 3 2 2d distribution of dlvo interaction energy 2d distribution of dlvo interaction energy between psnps and kl psnps and mt psnps and il psnps and qs are presented in figs 2 a d the dlvo curves at ionic strength 1 mm are shown in figs s4a d as can be seen from the 2d distribution of dlvo interaction energy in figs 2a d with the decrease of h separation distance the interaction energy increases at first and then decreases and then increases the change of dlvo energy barrier with ionic strength is obtained based on the 2d distribution of dlvo interaction energy to determine the cis related to psnps aggregation adsorption and mobility in porous media it can be seen that the dlvo energy barrier decreases with ionic strength figs 3 a d the dlvo energy barrier of psnps kl reaches the lowest value and tends to be stable when ionic strength exceeds 17 0 mm indicating that the mobility of psnps is weakest under this condition when ionic strength reaches 17 0 mm the barrier of the dlvo interaction energy between psnps and kl decreases to the lowest value this phenomenon suggests the mobility of psnps is inhibited when ionic strength exceeds 17 0 mm cis similarly the cis values of psnps mt psnps il and psnps qs are19 3 mm 21 0 mm and 23 9 mm respectively the lower cis value indicates that psnps is more easily adsorbed on the surface of the medium so the cis results suggest the inhibition effect of kl on psnps mobility is larger than that of mt and il the cis value of dlvo interaction energy between psnps and qs is larger than the cis value of dlvo interaction energy between psnps and clay minerals indicating that clay minerals have a stronger inhibition effect on the mobility of psnps than qs as can be seen in figs s4a d under the same ionic strength 1 mm the dlvo energy barriers of psnps kl psnps mt and psnps il are almost the same which is lower than that of psnps qs which again indicates that clay minerals have a stronger inhibition effect on psnps mobility than that of qs in addition the dlvo energy trap of psnps kl is lower than that of psnps mt and psnps il suggesting that kl has the greatest inhibitory effect on psnps mobility followed by mt and il 3 3 psnps mobility under different conditions 3 3 1 mass fraction of clay minerals the btcs of psnps under the different mass fractions of clay minerals are shown in figs 4 a c and e as can be seen in figs 4a c and e the transport of psnps is affected when qs are mixed with clay minerals kl mt il the peak value of c c0 of btc reaches 0 76 and the mass recovery rate of psnps reaches 62 16 when the porous media packed in the column is single qs without any clay minerals however when the mass fractions of kl increase to 1 2 3 and 3 5 corresponding peak values of c c0 are 0 52 0 44 0 38 and 0 31 respectively table s1 the mass recovery rates of psnps decrease to 43 8 41 8 27 8 and 25 0 respectively when the mass fractions of mt are 1 2 3 and 3 5 the peak values of c c0 become 0 60 0 53 0 45 and 0 37 and the mass recovery rates of psnps are 55 0 49 7 32 5 and 28 7 respectively table s2 as the mass fractions of il are 1 2 3 and 3 5 corresponding peak values of c c0 become 0 70 0 63 0 58 and 0 50 and the mass recovery rates of psnps are 61 2 60 8 46 0 and 39 8 respectively table s3 experimental results suggest three kinds of clay minerals all inhibited the mobility of psnps in porous media and kl has the greatest inhibition effect compared with mt and il which are consistent with the predictions based on the 2d distribution of dlvo interaction energy based on experimental results and previous studies lagaly et al 2006 kriaa et al 2009 zhou et al 2012 the inhibitory effect of clay minerals on the transport of psnps is mainly attributed to the presence of positively charged edge positions on the surface of clay minerals the permanent charges of the silicate layers are generated by isomeric substitution and the degree of substitution varies from layer to layer to a certain extent lagaly and ziesmer 2003 kriaa et al 2009 zhou et al 2012 therefore the interlayer cation density also varies depending on the interlayer space and can vary in the direction parallel to the layers heterogeneous charge distribution the presence of aluminum and silanol groups at the edges of these layers is positively charged at low ph and negatively charged at high ph thus clay minerals contain many amphiphilic sites such as octahedral al oh sites at the fractured edges of the crystal structure and the exposed end hydroxyl planes tombacz and szekeres 2004 zhou et al 2012 according to previous studies kl has a ph pzc value of 6 6 5 tombacz and szekeres 2006 mt has a ph pzc value of about 6 5 tombacz and szekeres 2004 while il has a ph pzc value of only 2 5 hussain et al 1996 as a result at this experimental condition ph 6 0 the net charge of kl and mt are negative but most of the edge sites are positively charged compared to il these positively charged sites of kl and mt would provide favorable deposition sites for negatively charged psnps and significantly inhibit their transport however the inhibitory effect of kl on psnps is significantly greater than that of mt figs 4a and c this is because the edge area of kl accounts for 20 30 of the total surface area while the edge area of mt is less than 1 of the total surface area wan and tokunaga 2002 therefore kl has more positively charged marginal positions than mt in addition clay minerals can also inhibit the migration of psnps by affecting the flow path of psnps in porous media the grain size of these clay minerals 80 μm is much smaller than that of qs 0 425 0 500 mm when qs and clay particles are densely packed the pore space decreases and more zone with low flow velocity or flow stagnation are created therefore the presence of clay minerals can alter the flow channel by creating narrower pore throats qi et al 2014 however the transport of psnps is significantly inhibited when the mass fraction of il is 3 5 while the inhibitory effect is not obvious when the mass fraction of il is 1 it can be concluded that the inhibition effect may not be dominant under the condition of the same particle size in summary the inhibition effect of clay minerals on psnps mobility is mainly caused by affecting the electrostatic interaction between psnps and the medium psnps transport in porous media containing clay minerals is simulated by the transport model based on single point deposition kinetics with good effect r2 0 84 the simulation results are consistent with experimental results tables s1 s3 as shown in figs s5 s7 when the mass fraction of kl increases from 0 to 3 5 the value of k increases from 2 1 10 2 min 1 to 1 23 10 1 min 1 and the value of s max increases from 3 63 mg g 1 to 11 7 mg g 1 as the mass fraction of mt increases from 0 to 3 5 k increases from 2 1 10 2 min 1 to 1 01 10 1 min 1 and s max increases from 3 63 mg g 1 to 10 2 mg g 1 similarly as the mass fraction of il increases from 0 to 3 5 k increases from 2 1 10 2 min 1 to 1 03 10 1 min 1 and s max increases from 3 63 mg g 1 to 10 2 mg g 1 it can be seen that the psnps deposition is enhanced under the high mass fraction of clay and the maximum deposition concentration on the media surface also increases 3 3 2 ionic strength the btcs of psnps under different ionic strengths are shown in figs 4b d and f the peak value of c c0 of btcs and mass recovery rate of psnps decrease with the ionic strength of background solution for psnps transport in qs kl porous media the corresponding peak value of c c0 of btcs decreases from 0 63 to 0 01 when the ionic strength increases from 0 mm to 20 mm na for psnps transport in qs mt porous media the corresponding peak value of c c0 of btcs decreases from 0 65 to 0 01 when the ionic strength increases from 0 mm to 20 mm na for psnps transport in qs il porous media the corresponding peak value of c c0 of btcs decreases from 0 73 to 0 02 when the ionic strength increases from 0 mm to 20 mm na in addition ionic strength na also has an apparent influence on the mass fraction of psnps in qs kl qs mt and qs il table s1 s3 when the mass fraction of clay minerals and other conditions are constant the charge effect and physical strain at the edge sites can be neglected lu et al 2021 moreover the surface change of psnps and porous media is changed with ionic strength fig s3a e these results indicate that ionic strength is an important factor controlling the mobility of psnps as the ionic strength increases na is electrically neutralized with negatively charged media and psnps resulting in weaker electrostatic repulsion between psnps and media and easier deposition on the media surface under the same condition of ionic strength the inhibition effect of il on the mobility of psnps is weaker than that of mt the inhibition effect of mt on the mobility of psnps is weaker than that of kl which is consistent with the results of the 2d distribution of dlvo interaction energy the edges of kl and mt are positively charged and the edges of il are negatively charged therefore the edges of kl and mt provide favorable deposition sites for psnps similarly because the percentage of the total area of the kl edge region is larger than that of mt the inhibition effect of kl on psnps mobility is greater than that of mt the transport of psnps in porous media containing clay minerals under different ionic strengths is simulated by the transport model based on single point deposition kinetics which is consistent with experimental results r2 80 when ionic strength increases from 0 mm to 20 mm in the qs kl column k increases from 3 11 10 2 min 1 to 1 54 10 1 min 1 and s max increases from 6 96 mg g 1 to 18 6 mg g 1 as ionic strength increases from 0 mm to 20 mm in qs mt porous media k increases from 2 71 10 2 min 1 to 1 43 10 1 min 1 and s max increases from 6 61 mg g 1 to 13 3 mg g 1 when ionic strength increases from 0 mm to 20 mm in qs il porous media k increases from 2 31 10 2 min 1 to 1 09 10 1 min 1 and s max increases from 5 00 mg g 1 to 11 0 mg g 1 according to model results the higher ionic strength leads to a stronger inhibition effect on the psnps mobility 3 3 3 the relationship between transport kinetic parameters and dlvo interaction energy an integrated dlvo energy barrier is calculated to analyze the relationship between transport kinetic parameters of psnps in porous media containing clay minerals and dlvo interaction energy 3 b i d b p s q s b p c c m where bid represents the integrated value of dlvo energy barriers kt qs represents the mass fraction of qs in porous media cm represents the mass fraction of clay minerals in porous media bps represents the barrier of the dlvo interaction energy between psnps and qs kt bpc represents the barrier of the dlvo interaction energy between psnps and clay minerals bpk bpm or bpi kt bpk represents the barrier of the dlvo interaction energy between psnps and kl kt bpm represents the barrier of the dlvo interaction energy between psnps and mt kt bpi represents the barrier of the dlvo interaction energy between psnps and il kt regression analysis is conducted to investigate the relationship between the integrated dlvo energy barrier and kinetic parameters related to psnps mobility the obtained equations of k s max and r m related to psnps mobility are illustrated in table s4 regression analysis shows that both k and s max linearly decrease with the logarithm of the integrated value of the dlvo energy barrier figs 5 a and b however the mass recovery rate of psnps nonlinearly increases with the logarithm of the integrated value of the dlvo energy barrier figs 5c and an exponential function appears between the mass recovery rate of psnps and the logarithm of the integrated value of the dlvo energy barrier the determination coefficients r2 of fitted equations of k and the mass recovery rate of psnps both exceed 0 8 which is higher than r2 0 695 of the fitted equation of s max table s4 these results suggest the 2d distribution of dlvo interaction energy has a significant ability to quantify and predict psnps transport and related kinetic parameters in natural porous media containing clay minerals the first order deposition term is much more simplistic than what is nicely worked out by previous cotransport models chrysikopoulos et al 2017 katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2014 2015 2016 and 2021 however the aim of our research is to investigate the accurate relationship between kinetic parameters and dlvo barriers and the critical ionic strengths na ca2 related to psnps mobility in the multicomponent porous media results suggest the surfaces of dlvo interaction energy obtained in this study can be used to predict the kinetic parameters related to psnps mobility in porous media containing clay minerals results suggest the transport process of psnps in the multicomponent porous media can be well simulated by the psnps transport model based on single point kinetics significantly k s max and mass recovery rate of psnps are highly correlated with dlvo energy barriers therefore the surfaces of dlvo interaction energy obtained in this study can be used to predict the kinetic parameters related to psnps mobility in porous media containing clay minerals even though the porous media consists of quartz sand and clay mineral an important step is taken in predicting the transport ability of microplastics in the multicomponent porous media by dlvo moreover the application of fe2o3 and al2o3 that has positive charges on the surface considering filtration theory remobilization collector grain size size dependent dispersivity and flow rates will be conducted in our future work and we believe more interesting and significant can be obtained 4 conclusions experimental and model results suggest that clay minerals have an important influence on the mobility of psnps in porous media the 2d distribution of dlvo interaction energy indicates that kl has the strongest inhibition effect on the mobility of psnps followed by mt and il which is consistent with experimental results based on the characterization of the three kinds of clay minerals the presence of clay minerals leads to more psnps retention due to their rough and unsmooth surfaces the edges of kl and mt are positively charged and the edges of il are negatively charged therefore kl and mt can provide more deposition sites for psnps meanwhile the percentage of the total area of kl edge region is larger than that of mt resulting in a greater inhibition effect on psnps transport by kl simultaneously the presence of clay minerals can alter the flow channel by creating narrower pore throats which inhibit the mobility of psnps the 2d distribution of dlvo interaction energy suggests the cis values of psnps kl psnps mt and psnps il are 17 0 mm 19 3 mm and 21 0 mm respectively moreover both parameters k and s max linearly decrease with the logarithm of the integrated value of the dlvo energy barrier while the mass recovery rate of psnps rm exponentially increases with the logarithm of the integrated value of the dlvo energy barrier the effects of clay type mass fraction of clay minerals and ionic strength on the mobility of psnp are systematically investigated in this study which can provide theoretical and technical bases for the prediction prevention and control of microplastic contamination in the groundwater systems having great significance and important potential application value eqn 1 3 declaration of

15576,large cyanobacterial colonies which are unique niches for heterotrophic bacteria are vital for blooming in eutrophic waters however the seasonal dynamics of molecular insights into microbes in these colonies remain unclear here the community composition and metabolism pattern of microbes inhabiting large cyanobacterial colonies 120 µm collected from lake taihu in china were investigated monthly the community structure of total microbes was mostly influenced by chlorophyll a chl a total phosphorus tp concentration dissolved oxygen and temperature whereas the colony associated bacteria excluding cyanobacteria were mostly influenced by total organic carbon no3 and po4 3 concentrations indicating different response patterns of cyanobacteria and the associated bacteria to water nutrient conditions metatranscriptomic data suggested that similar to that of cyanobacteria the gene expression patterns of the most active bacteria such as proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were not strictly dependent on season but separated by chl a concentrations samples in july and september high bloom period and february and march non bloom period formed two distinct clusters whereas those of other months low bloom period clustered together the accumulation of transcripts for pathways such as phycobilisome from cyanobacteria and bacterial chemotaxis and flagellum phosphate metabolism and sulfur oxidation from proteobacteria was enriched in high and low bloom periods than in non bloom period network analyses revealed that cyanobacteria and proteobacteria exhibited coordinated transcriptional patterns in almost all divided modules modules had cyanobacteria dominated hub gene were positively correlated with temperature chl a total dissolved phosphorus and nh4 and no2 concentrations whereas modules had proteobacteria dominated hub gene were positively correlated with tp and po4 3 these results indicated labor division might exist in the colonies this study provided metabolic insights into microbes in large cyanobacterial colonies and would support the understanding and management of the year round cyanobacterial blooms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cyanobacterial colony microcystis blooms microbial flora interactions between bacteria and cyanobacteria metabolic insights data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction cyanobacterial blooms are notorious for its wide occurrence and expansion in eutrophic freshwaters worldwide huisman et al 2018 cyanobacterial blooms remarkably degrade water quality impair ecosystems and influence carbon and nutrient cycling in these ecosystems some severe cyanobacterial blooms such as cyanobacterial blooms in lake taihu in china in 2007 qin et al 2009 and in lake erie in american in 2014 steffen et al 2017 have caused drinking water crisis cyanobacterial blooms primarily occur in warm seasons however some cyanobacterial blooms may even present under low temperature ma et al 2016 climate change such as warming and extreme rainfall events and anthropogenic nutrient enrichment are assumed to exacerbate cyanobacterial blooms occurrence synergistically paerl et al 2016 cyanobacterial blooms in subtropical lakes are assumed to experience recruitment in spring vigorous in summer decline in autumn and overwinters in water column or sediment kong and gao 2005 the bloom process and dominant cyanobacterial species are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature light and nutrient availability shan et al 2019 cyanobacteria may also change their metabolic activities or transcriptomic level of critical enzymes involved in different processes such as rapid phosphorus and nitrogen assimilation and carbon dioxide concentrating mechanism to adapt to nutrient fluctuations harke et al 2016 harke and gobler 2013 sandrini et al 2016 thus the diverse species and physiological characteristics of cyanobacteria facilitate their ecological niche extension and expansion bloom forming cyanobacteria are commonly present in cyanobacterial colonies which are composed of cyanobacterial cells surrounded with sheath and are rich in polysaccharide attract large numbers of bacteria in the phycosphere cyanobacterial colonies harbor specific bacteria that are different from other habitats in the same water systems parveen et al 2013 shi et al 2012 2018 thus cyanobacterial bloom events considerably alter bacterial community in water systems li et al 2012 tromas et al 2017 furthermore intense interactions between bacteria and cyanobacteria have occurred in cyanobacterial colonies cook et al 2020 and close metabolic links are observed between cyanobacteria and attached bacteria li et al 2018 moreover bacteria may facilitate algal growth through the biosynthesis of essential growth factors and remineralization of nutrients heterotrophic bacteria in cyanobacterial colonies are emerging as critical drivers in the development and maintenance of cyanobacterial blooms woodhouse et al 2016 however the gene expression patterns of cyanobacteria and their associated bacteria in cyanobacterial colonies in response to environmental changes during a whole year and the metabolic relationships among cyanobacteria associated bacteria and environmental factors are still unclear the formation of large colonies of some cyanobacterial species is important to their dominance and or bloom formation yamamoto et al 2011 because microcystis colonies with size larger than 100 µm dominated during summer zhu et al 2016 concentrated in the upper layer wu and kong 2009 and promote surface scum formation wu et al 2021 moreover deciphering molecular mechanisms underlying large cyanobacterial colonies may facilitate in determining the triggers of cyanobacterial blooms recently metatranscriptomic analyses are a powerful tool to gain detailed insights into the metabolic and physiological status of certain taxa from mixed algal and microbial communities cooper et al 2014 marchetti et al 2012 here we present the metatranscriptomes of large cyanobacterial colonies 120 µm for a year in the meiliang bay of lake taihu which is near the taihu laboratory for lake ecosystem research we focus on cyanobacteria and their dominant associated bacterial phyla such as proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria and firmicutes our data illustrate the flexibility of cyanobacteria and the dominant associated bacterial transcriptomes in large cyanobacterial colonies revealing unexpected functional differentiation of microorganisms across seasons and bloom intensity 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling sampling took place in the meiliang bay of lake taihu in china fig 1 a from december 2015 to november 2016 except

expression pattern analyses all genes in the metatranscriptome data and genes that were annotated to dominant phyla were used to analyze expression patterns respectively differential expression analyses were conducted using edger package in accordance with the quasi likelihood pipeline chen et al 2016 they were normalized by the trimmed means of m values tmm method using the bioconductor

meiliang bay of lake taihu water temperature increased gradually from 8 c in december 2015 to 33 c in july 2016 fig 1b chl a concentrations gradually increased from december to september with some fluctuations and then decreased in accordance with the definition of cyanobacterial bloom based on chl a concentrations xu et al 2015 the 12 months of a whole year could be divided into three stages

were also dominant supplementary fig 1 during these two months non bloom period pure cyanobacterial colonies were difficult to collect due to their low biomass thus we collected particles larger than 120 μm to ensure sufficient sample for the following dna and rna extraction rhodococcus unclassified cytophagaceae unclassified alcaligenaceae and roseomonas were the dominant bacterial species fig 2b rhodococcus sp is reported to be able to degrade microcystin manage et al 2009 whereas other species are observed to be associated with cyanobacterial blooms shi et al 2018 cca revealed that chl a and tp concentrations do and temperature were the influencing factors on total bacterial community when cyanobacteria were involved fig 2c cca on bacterial communities excluding cyanobacterial sequences showed that bacterial communities were grouped into three clusters in accordance with adjacent months one cluster was composed of samples collected in february and march one cluster was composed of samples collected from august to november and another cluster was composed of the other months fig 2d toc no3 and po4 3 concentrations influenced the bacterial community structure most the result that the bacterial community in large cyanobacterial colonies was influenced by no3 was consistent with results of previous studies on bacteria attached to particles shi et al 2018 tang et al 2017 3 3 overview of metatranscriptomic data we recovered more than 88 5 putatively bacterial protein coding transcripts in most samples except 13 0 and 26 5 of sequences which were assigned to putatively bacterial protein coding transcripts in february and march 2017 respectively due to the dominance of eukaryotic algae such as diatom supplementary fig 1 in this study only bacterial metatranscriptomes were used for further analyses most bacterial mrna functional transcripts were derived from cyanobacteria 75 3 97 8 and proteobacteria 1 3 15 2 followed by firmicutes 0 2 2 7 bacteroidetes 0 1 2 5 and actinobacteria 0 2 1 7 fig 3 a the results showed that the relative abundance of mrna from cyanobacteria was much higher than that of their 16s rrna gene sequencing within cyanobacterial colonies the dominant mrna functional categories level 1 subsystem in all samples were photosynthesis protein metabolism carbohydrates clustering based subsystems amino acids and derivatives miscellaneous cofactors vitamins prosthetic groups pigments respiration rna metabolism and stress response fig 3b 3 4 gene expression pattern analyses all metatranscriptome data on gene function level were first analyzed by the mds plot by using edger which can give robust results even when the sample sizes are very small chen et al 2016 twelve rna samples were clustered into three dimensions which coincided with the three cyanobacterial bloom stages based on chl a concentration i e high july and september non february and march and low bloom other months groups fig 3c given that we usually divided annual cyanobacterial blooms into three phases including pre bloom from february to march bloom from april to september and post bloom from october to january periods zhu et al 2021 the division of the three groups in this study was interesting this result indicated that the microbial gene expression pattern in the large cyanobacterial colonies was dependent on chl a density and not strictly dependent on season this was like quorum sensing which is commonly in the phycosphere and is controlled by cell density for bacteria to coordinate their gene expressions rolland et al 2016 this result also indicated that the metabolic activities of large cyanobacterial colonies in spring april may and june and autumn october november and december were similar this feature was a good explanation for the occurrence of cyanobacterial bloom even in early winter which was because various cyanobacterial species had wide adaptation mechanisms to environmental changes as such the following differential expression analyses were based on these three groups the total bacterial metatranscriptomic data were prepared between high and non bloom low and non bloom and high and low bloom periods fig 3d 3f differential expression analysis on the specific gene functions of the top five phyla including cyanobacteria proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria and firmicutes were conducted table 2 the mds plot showed similar patterns between the gene expression levels of phyla and total bacteria and could be divided into the same three groups supplementary fig 2 a similar gene expression pattern indicated close metabolic links between cyanobacteria and these associated bacteria besides comparisons were made on the basis of different grouping schemes such as grouping in accordance with different seasons however no significant difference could be obtained among different groups data not shown gene functions with fold change 2 sde2 fdr p 0 05 between communities were used to prepare a volcano plot supplementary fig 3 the detailed information of differently expressed genes derived from specific phyla is shown in supplementary material 1 overall proteobacteria had the most while cyanobacteria had the minimal over represented genes in high and low bloom samples these results indicated that cyanobacteria had higher growth potential and faced more environmental stress during low and non bloom periods than during high bloom period 3 5 phylum specific enriched pathways in different bloom periods the dotplot shows enriched transcripts for pathways derived from different phyla at different bloom periods fig 4 briefly this result indicated high metabolic activity of the associated bacteria in cyanobacterial colonies during bloom periods including high and low bloom periods and labor divisions among these microbes for cyanobacteria the enriched accumulation of transcripts for pathways such as major pigment phycobilisome and chlorophyll co2 uptake and carbon metabolism and photosystem i were involved which are vital for high algal cell production fig 4a so the result was good explanation for maintenance of high cyanobacterial biomass in july and september during low bloom period the enriched accumulation of transcripts for pathways including histidine biosynthesis urea decomposition and molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis are good for the formation and maintenance of cyanobacterial colonies which have similar underlying mechanisms to biofilm shi et al 2022 histidine biosynthesis is a metabolic crossroad and plays an important role in cellular metabolism being interconnected to the de novo synthesis of purine and nitrogen metabolism fani et al 2007 these enriched pathways facilitate colony growth and proliferation for proteobacteria the accumulation of transcripts for pathways such as chemotaxis and flagellum sulfur and phosphorus metabolism increased during both high and low bloom periods fig 4b numerous studies showed that chemotaxis and flagellum are closely related to the nutrient acquisition of bacteria in addition chemotaxis and flagellum plays an important role in bacterial collective behavior such as biofilm formation and interaction with their hosts colin et al 2021 we speculate that during bloom period along with the formation and growth of cyanobacterial colony the chemotaxis and flagellum of proteobacteria are enhanced to increase the attachment to cyanobacterial colonies which contain rich nutrients at the same time the attachment of these bacteria may facilitate the maintenance of cyanobacterial colony structure and nutrient cycling during the bloom period shi et al 2022 given the mutualism and metabolic complementary relationships between cyanobacteria and the attached proteobacteria li et al 2018 and the phosphorus transference between microcystis and its attached bacteria jiang et al 2007 the increased bacterial phosphate metabolism is helpful for nutrient transformation which is beneficial for the rapid cell growth of cyanobacteria the occurrence of biological sulfur oxidation in the water column during cyanobacterial decomposition has been observed during high and low bloom periods the death and decomposition of high cyanobacterial biomass always happen thus the enriched sulfur oxidation may be good evidence for sulfur cycling during bloom period chen et al 2020 for bacteroidetes the numbers of enriched accumulated transcripts for pathways during low and non bloom period were more than that during high bloom period fig 4c transcripts for pathways such as bacterial cell division de novo purine biosynthesis and peptidoglycan biosynthesis were enriched during low bloom and non bloom period de novo purine biosynthesis support survival in niche environments that are limited in purine bioavailability and the role of the purine nucleotide biosynthesis on biofilm formation and symbiosis with organisms are widely reported kim et al 2014 peptidoglycan biosynthesis is vital for cell growth and disturbance of cell wall components such as peptidoglycan hampers biofilm formation bucher et al 2015 for actinobacteria transcripts for pathways such as ribosome lsu bacterial ribosome ssu bacterial methionine biosynthesis mycolic acid synthesis and de novo purine biosynthesis in the low bloom period are enriched fig 4d these results indicated higher activity of actinobacteria during the low bloom period for firmicutes transcripts for pathways such as arginine biosynthesis extended bacterial cell division de novo purine biosynthesis ribosome lsu bacterial ribosome ssu bacterial in the low bloom period are enriched fig 4e these results indicated that similar to actinobacteria firmicutes had high activity during the low bloom period therefore different microbial phyla enriched the accumulation of transcripts for different pathways during different bloom period thus the function differentiation of microbes in large cyanobacterial colonies may be a critical role for their overwhelming dominance and adaptation ability from warm conditions to cold conditions ma et al 2016 3 6 coordinated expression patterns in cyanobacteria and dominant phyla expression patterns were significantly coordinated between cyanobacteria and these dominant microbes with 1510 cyanobacterial and 1466 microbial genes clustered into 13 wgcna co expression modules fig 5 a the presence of genes from cyanobacteria and the dominant bacterial phyla within almost every significant co expression module suggested coordinated regulation across metabolic pathways in different phyla especially between cyanobacteria and proteobacteria this result indicated close relationships between cyanobacteria and proteobacteria and this finding was documented by many other scientists through other methods steffen et al 2012 zhu et al 2021 among the 13 modules the numbers of genes related to proteobacteria in modules turquoise meturquoise black meblack and yellow were higher than those to cyanobacteria whereas the opposite was observed in other modules fig 5a modules brown mebrown and green megreen harbored the highest number of genes related to photosynthesis and nitrogen metabolism respectively meturquoise harbored the highest number of genes related to membrane transport respiration rna metabolism cell wall and capsule dna metabolism protein metabolism carbohydrates cofactors vitamins prosthetic groups pigments clustering based subsystems amino acids and derivatives miscellaneous nucleosides and nucleotides and stress response fig 5b furthermore many metabolic processes such as cell wall and capsule dna metabolism protein metabolism carbohydrates cofactors and vitamins were present in almost all modules the co expression of genes related to cyanobacteria and the dominant phyla in these metabolic processes had been observed which confirmed the metabolic links between microbes in cyanobacterial colonies revealed by metagenomics methods cook et al 2020 li et al 2018 3 7 associations among modules genes and environmental factors mebrown was positively correlated with chl a concentration and temperature fig 5c megreen was positively correlated with tdp nh4 and no2 concentrations the module red mered was positively correlated with toc concentration and most positively correlated with do concentrations meblack was positively correlated with po4 3 concentration the module pink mepink was positively correlated with tp concentration by contrast meturquoise was significantly negatively related to chl a tn and tdn concentrations and ph fig 5c genes in different modules controlled by different environmental factors indicated varying gene response to environmental changes this finding was important for understanding the wide adaptation ability of cyanobacterial colonies as proposed by many algal physiological scientists carey et al 2012 in mebrown 29 of the top 30 hub genes were predominantly from cyanobacteria supplementary fig 4a among these 29 genes 6 were related to photosynthesis 4 were related to protein metabolism and 3 were related to amino acids and derivatives given that mebrown was positively correlated with chl a concentration and temperature increases in chl a concentration and temperature might result in or promote the expression of genes related to photosynthesis and respiration the positive relationship between these photosynthetic proteins and temperature might explain the finding that cyanobacterial bloom likes hot climate paerl and huisman 2008 in megreen 26 of the top 30 hub genes were predominantly from cyanobacteria supplementary fig 4b given that megreen was positively correlated with tdp nh4 and no2 concentrations these results indicated that the three environmental factors significantly influenced many metabolic processes in cyanobacteria nh4 can be a key factor in the determination of the distribution of cyanobacterial bloom in freshwater systems dai et al 2012 tdp is positively affected by total cyanobacterial biomass amorim et al 2020 no2 is a driving factor for cyanobacterial succession cai and kong 2013 in mered 20 of the top 30 hub genes were dominantly from cyanobacteria and 6 genes were from proteobacteria supplementary fig 4c toc concentration is remarkably influenced by cyanobacterial blooms and may be modified by bacteria ye et al 2015 these results indicated close association between the toc concentration and the metabolism of cyanobacteria and the four dominant bacterial phyla in meblack the top 30 hub genes 14 genes were related to protein metabolism were predominantly from proteobacteria except the one gene related to dna metabolism which was from cyanobacteria supplementary fig 4d given that meblack was positively correlated with po4 3 concentration these results indicated the significant influence of po4 3 on the protein metabolism of proteobacteria interestingly po4 3 directly influenced the metabolism of bacteria rather than cyanobacteria dip was commonly assumed to limit bacterial production indirectly by limiting phytoplankton which might limit the carbon available to bacteria however doc originating from allochthonous and autochthonous organic matters in lake taihu zhang et al 2011 and bacteria in the large cyanobacterial colonies may be limited by phosphorus rather than carbon in mepink 16 of the top 30 hub genes were dominantly from proteobacteria six genes related to carbohydrates miscellaneous and protein metabolism were from firmicutes 4 genes were from actinobacteria 2 genes were from bacteroidetes and 2 genes were from cyanobacteria supplementary fig 4e given that mepink was positively correlated with tp concentration these results indicated the influence of tp concentration on the growth and metabolism of all four dominant phyla particularly proteobacteria this result combined with the result of positive correlations between po4 3 concentration and meblack which was also dominated by proteobacteria suggested that phosphorus directly influenced proteobacteria rather than cyanobacteria in meturquoise among the top 30 hub genes 13 genes related to metabolisms such as photosynthesis nitrogen metabolism were affiliated to cyanobacteria supplementary fig 4f twelve genes were affiliated to proteobacteria four genes were from bacteroidetes one gene was from firmicutes given that meturquoise was significantly negatively related to chl a tn and tdn concentrations and ph these results indicated that the metabolic processes of cyanobacteria proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were regulated in response to combined changes in chl a tn and tdn concentrations and ph 3 8 significance of the interactions among cyanobacteria bacteria and environment in large cyanobacterial colonies in wgcna a topological overlap measure tom matrix reflecting the relative interconnectivity between two genes was calculated on the basis of the adjacent coefficient and the number of shared interacting partners between any pairs of co expressed genes langfelder and horvath 2008 based on this analysis metabolic links between cyanobacteria and the associated bacteria were observed here interconnections on three metabolisms such as phosphorus metabolism nitrogen metabolism cofactors vitamins prosthetic groups pigments with tom values higher than 0 1 were described as follows phosphorus metabolism in meturquoise the alkaline phosphatase and inorganic pyrophosphatase from proteobacteria and alkaline phosphatase and pyrophosphate energized proton pump from bacteroidetes were interconnected with many metabolisms such as photosystem ii respiration protein metabolism miscellaneous cell wall and capsule carbohydrates and nitrogen metabolism from cyanobacteria fig 6 by contrast the alkaline phosphatase from cyanobacteria was interconnected with exoribonuclease ii and type iii restriction modification system methylation subunit in rna metabolism and dna metabolism from firmicutes and proteobacteria alkaline phosphatase may make more inorganic phosphate available through degradation of organic matter cao et al 2009 gao et al 2006 results indicated that the associated bacteria through higher express of alkaline phosphatase to meet their phosphorus demand which might also benefit many metabolic pathways of cyanobacteria however cyanobacterial cells in a large colony might use dna or rna materials from the associated bacteria to meet their phosphorus demand in megreen the probable low affinity inorganic phosphate transporter from cyanobacteria was interconnected with many metabolisms of all the four associated bacterial phyla including miscellaneous carbohydrates membrane transport virulence disease and defense from firmicutes and proteobacteria amino acids and derivatives and clustering based subsystems from actinobacteria and cell wall and capsule stress response and clustering based subsystems from bacteroidetes in mepink an interconnection of high affinity phosphate transporter and control of pho regulon from proteobacteria and protein metabolism cell division and cell cycle amino acids and derivatives from cyanobacteria was observed high affinity and low affinity phosphate transporters can assimilate inorganic p under the p low and p rich conditions respectively hsieh and wanner 2010 megreen was significantly correlated with tdp concentration and had cyanobacteria dominated hub gene whereas mepink was significantly correlated with tp concentration and had proteobacteria dominated hub gene this result also indicated that cyanobacteria might use the dissolved phosphorus produced during the metabolic or mineralization process by the associated bacteria nitrogen metabolism in meturquoise ammonia assimilation from cyanobacteria were interconnected with many metabolic processes such as miscellaneous clustering based subsystems protein metabolism phosphorus metabolism virulence respiration and sulfur metabolism from all four associated bacterial phyla fig 6 in megreen nitrogen fixation and no3 and no2 ammonification by cyanobacteria were highly connected with many metabolic processes such as miscellaneous virulence disease and defense carbohydrates and cell wall and capsule from all four associated bacterial phyla fig 6 only in mered the nitric oxide synthase from actinobacteria was interconnected with many metabolic processes such as regulation and cell signaling stress response clustering based subsystems and protein metabolism from cyanobacteria interestingly an interconnection of nitrogen metabolism from other associated bacteria with other metabolic processes from cyanobacteria was not evident many studies revealed that the nitrogen cycling process was dominated by cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria in lake taihu krausfeldt et al 2017 denitrification does not relieve the lake of excessive n inputs and cyanobacteria may thrive on newly supplied and previously loaded nitrogen sources to maintain its dominance in lake taihu paerl et al 2011 however this nitrogen cycling process by the associated bacteria was not evident in the investigated large buoyant cyanobacterial colonies given megreen was significantly correlated with nh4 and no2 concentrations and had cyanobacteria dominated hub gene these results indicated increased influence of nitrogen metabolisms by cyanobacteria on the associated bacteria than vice versa cofactors vitamins prosthetic groups pigments the nad consumption from firmicutes pterin biosynthesis from bacteroidetes and pterin biosynthesis riboflavin fmn and fad metabolism pyridoxin vitamin b6 biosynthesis biotin biosynthesis and so on from proteobacteria were interconnected with many cyanobacterial metabolic processes such as clustering based subsystems rna metabolism carbohydrates and photosynthesis fig 6 simultaneously some of cofactors and vitamin metabolism from cyanobacteria were interconnected with many metabolisms such as dna metabolism membrane transport and clustering based subsystems from bacteroidetes proteobacteria or firmicutes in meturquiose coenzyme b12 biosynthesis from proteobacteria was interconnected with riboflavin fmn and fad metabolism from cyanobacteria nad consumption from proteobacteria was interconnected with chlorophyll biosynthesis from cyanobacteria in megreen tocopherol biosynthesis pyridoxin vitamin b6 biosynthesis from proteobacteria were interconnected with coenzyme b12 biosynthesis ygfz iron biotin biosynthesis bilin biosynthesis and cobalamin synthesis from cyanobacteria in mered ubiquinone biosynthesis from proteobacteria was interconnected with folate biosynthesis from cyanobacteria besides many connections of cofactors vitamins prosthetic groups were observed within the same phylum for example in proteobacteria nad regulation 5 fcl like protein and ygfz were interconnected with heme and siroheme biosynthesis and pyridoxin vitamin b6 biosynthesis in cyanobacteria coenzyme b12 biosynthesis biotin biosynthesis cobalamin synthesis and molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis were interconnected with one another both cyanobacteria and bacteria have complex cofactor and vitamin metabolisms cook et al 2020 these results indicated interactions among vitamin metabolic processes and other metabolic processes may exist in the holobiont of these large cyanobacterial colonies metabolic links between cyanobacteria and the associated bacteria are documented through metagenomics cook et al 2020 li et al 2018 xie et al 2016 the microbial structure of cyanobacterial aggregates is revealed to be influenced by nitrogen and phosphorus through co pathways zhu et al 2021 vigorous cyanobacterial blooms remained in lake taihu in autumn or might even persist through winter ma et al 2016 our metatranscriptomic results showed that the similar metabolic activity of cyanobacteria and the associated bacteria in large cyanobacterial colonies in spring autumn or early winter well explained this phenomenon and indicated the wide adaptation of cyanobacterial colonies to temperature fluctuations furthermore gene functions clustered into different modules were dominated by different microbes and influenced by different environmental factors these results indicated that divisions of labor in large cyanobacterial aggregates where cyanobacterial activities were influenced by chl a temperature and nitrogen and bacterial activities were influenced by phosphorus therefore metabolic links among cyanobacteria the associated bacteria and environmental factors revealed in this study provided insight into the adaptation of cyanobacterial colonies to environmental changes overall the gene expression patterns of the dominant phyla including cyanobacteria proteobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and actinobacteria in large cyanobacterial colonies are illustrated in fig 7 4 conclusions monthly metatranscriptomic data showed that the gene expression patterns of microbes in large cyanobacterial colonies were not strictly separated by different seasons but were dependent on chl a density the enriched accumulation of transcripts for pathways from cyanobacteria and other microbes were different these results illustrated similar gene expression patterns but different metabolic responses of cyanobacteria and associated bacteria to different bloom intensities the coordinated pattern of cyanobacteria and the associated bacteria especially proteobacteria was observed modules had cyanobacteria dominated hub gene were positively correlated with chl a temperature tdp nh4 and toc concentrations modules had proteobacteria dominated hub gene were correlated with po4 3 and tp concentrations furthermore results elicited possible beneficial influence of phosphorus metabolism from the associated bacteria on cyanobacteria whereas more influence of nitrogen metabolisms from cyanobacteria on the associated bacteria complementary metabolisms of cofactors vitamins prosthetic groups pigments may exist among holobiont members in these large cyanobacterial colonies these results indicated labor division of microbe and their different responses to environmental factors in cyanobacterial colonies this finding might be one of the major reasons for surviving

15576,large cyanobacterial colonies which are unique niches for heterotrophic bacteria are vital for blooming in eutrophic waters however the seasonal dynamics of molecular insights into microbes in these colonies remain unclear here the community composition and metabolism pattern of microbes inhabiting large cyanobacterial colonies 120 µm collected from lake taihu in china were investigated monthly the community structure of total microbes was mostly influenced by chlorophyll a chl a total phosphorus tp concentration dissolved oxygen and temperature whereas the colony associated bacteria excluding cyanobacteria were mostly influenced by total organic carbon no3 and po4 3 concentrations indicating different response patterns of cyanobacteria and the associated bacteria to water nutrient conditions metatranscriptomic data suggested that similar to that of cyanobacteria the gene expression patterns of the most active bacteria such as proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were not strictly dependent on season but separated by chl a concentrations samples in july and september high bloom period and february and march non bloom period formed two distinct clusters whereas those of other months low bloom period clustered together the accumulation of transcripts for pathways such as phycobilisome from cyanobacteria and bacterial chemotaxis and flagellum phosphate metabolism and sulfur oxidation from proteobacteria was enriched in high and low bloom periods than in non bloom period network analyses revealed that cyanobacteria and proteobacteria exhibited coordinated transcriptional patterns in almost all divided modules modules had cyanobacteria dominated hub gene were positively correlated with temperature chl a total dissolved phosphorus and nh4 and no2 concentrations whereas modules had proteobacteria dominated hub gene were positively correlated with tp and po4 3 these results indicated labor division might exist in the colonies this study provided metabolic insights into microbes in large cyanobacterial colonies and would support the understanding and management of the year round cyanobacterial blooms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cyanobacterial colony microcystis blooms microbial flora interactions between bacteria and cyanobacteria metabolic insights data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction cyanobacterial blooms are notorious for its wide occurrence and expansion in eutrophic freshwaters worldwide huisman et al 2018 cyanobacterial blooms remarkably degrade water quality impair ecosystems and influence carbon and nutrient cycling in these ecosystems some severe cyanobacterial blooms such as cyanobacterial blooms in lake taihu in china in 2007 qin et al 2009 and in lake erie in american in 2014 steffen et al 2017 have caused drinking water crisis cyanobacterial blooms primarily occur in warm seasons however some cyanobacterial blooms may even present under low temperature ma et al 2016 climate change such as warming and extreme rainfall events and anthropogenic nutrient enrichment are assumed to exacerbate cyanobacterial blooms occurrence synergistically paerl et al 2016 cyanobacterial blooms in subtropical lakes are assumed to experience recruitment in spring vigorous in summer decline in autumn and overwinters in water column or sediment kong and gao 2005 the bloom process and dominant cyanobacterial species are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature light and nutrient availability shan et al 2019 cyanobacteria may also change their metabolic activities or transcriptomic level of critical enzymes involved in different processes such as rapid phosphorus and nitrogen assimilation and carbon dioxide concentrating mechanism to adapt to nutrient fluctuations harke et al 2016 harke and gobler 2013 sandrini et al 2016 thus the diverse species and physiological characteristics of cyanobacteria facilitate their ecological niche extension and expansion bloom forming cyanobacteria are commonly present in cyanobacterial colonies which are composed of cyanobacterial cells surrounded with sheath and are rich in polysaccharide attract large numbers of bacteria in the phycosphere cyanobacterial colonies harbor specific bacteria that are different from other habitats in the same water systems parveen et al 2013 shi et al 2012 2018 thus cyanobacterial bloom events considerably alter bacterial community in water systems li et al 2012 tromas et al 2017 furthermore intense interactions between bacteria and cyanobacteria have occurred in cyanobacterial colonies cook et al 2020 and close metabolic links are observed between cyanobacteria and attached bacteria li et al 2018 moreover bacteria may facilitate algal growth through the biosynthesis of essential growth factors and remineralization of nutrients heterotrophic bacteria in cyanobacterial colonies are emerging as critical drivers in the development and maintenance of cyanobacterial blooms woodhouse et al 2016 however the gene expression patterns of cyanobacteria and their associated bacteria in cyanobacterial colonies in response to environmental changes during a whole year and the metabolic relationships among cyanobacteria associated bacteria and environmental factors are still unclear the formation of large colonies of some cyanobacterial species is important to their dominance and or bloom formation yamamoto et al 2011 because microcystis colonies with size larger than 100 µm dominated during summer zhu et al 2016 concentrated in the upper layer wu and kong 2009 and promote surface scum formation wu et al 2021 moreover deciphering molecular mechanisms underlying large cyanobacterial colonies may facilitate in determining the triggers of cyanobacterial blooms recently metatranscriptomic analyses are a powerful tool to gain detailed insights into the metabolic and physiological status of certain taxa from mixed algal and microbial communities cooper et al 2014 marchetti et al 2012 here we present the metatranscriptomes of large cyanobacterial colonies 120 µm for a year in the meiliang bay of lake taihu which is near the taihu laboratory for lake ecosystem research we focus on cyanobacteria and their dominant associated bacterial phyla such as proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria and firmicutes our data illustrate the flexibility of cyanobacteria and the dominant associated bacterial transcriptomes in large cyanobacterial colonies revealing unexpected functional differentiation of microorganisms across seasons and bloom intensity 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling sampling took place in the meiliang bay of lake taihu in china fig 1 a from december 2015 to november 2016 except that january to march 2016 which was replaced by january to march 2017 due to failure of rna extraction sampling was conducted between 09 30 am and 12 00 nn once a month samples were collected by towing a phytoplankton net 64 µm mesh through the water surface and the top buoyant cyanobacterial colonies were pipetted and filtered through a 120 µm mesh net at least three samples were then collected and placed into sterile polypropylene tubes tubes were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen simultaneously water temperature ph and dissolved oxygen do were monitored using a multiparameter meter model 6600 yellow spring instruments oh usa total phosphorus tp and total nitrogen tn were quantified using standard methods jin and tu 1990 for the analysis of nutrient concentrations including total dissolved phosphorus tdp total dissolved nitrogen tdn ammonium nh4 nitrate no3 nitrite no2 and phosphate po4 3 water samples were filtered through precombusted gf c glass filbers 47 mm diameter whatman and then the filtrates were analyzed with a continuous flow analyzer skalar san netherlands the gf c filters were used for chlorophyll a chl a measurement by extraction with 90 acetone and analyzed with a spectrofluorophotometer rf 5301 pc shimadzu japan 2 2 miseq sequencing of the 16s rrna genes nucleic acid extraction was conducted following a previously described method by tillett and neilan tillett and neilan 2000 the pcr amplification of the v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna gene was performed with the bacterial universal primers 338f 5 barcode actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 herlemann et al 2011 purified amplicons were sequenced with the illumina miseq pe300 by majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china raw data were first quality filtered with qiime to remove reads that did not meet the desired quality any chimeric sequence was identified and removed with the uchime operational taxonomic units otus were clustered with 97 similarity cutoff by using upars version 7 1 http drive5 com uparse the taxonomy of each 16s rrna gene sequence was analyzed by the rdp classifier http rdp cme msu edu against the silva 16s rrna database ssu123 max planck institute germany by using a 70 confidence threshold canonical correspondence analysis cca was applied to determine the association of environmental variables with changes in the bacterial

sequencing the total rna of triplicate samples from each month were extracted using the rnaeasy mini kit qiagen 74 106 following the provided protocol including the on column rnase free dnase treatment rnas were confirmed via agarose gel 1 electrophoresis and pulled together the quantity and quality of extracted rna were checked using the agilent 2100 bioanalyzer agilent technologies santa clara ca usa ribosomal rna in total rna was then depleted by using the ribo zero rrna removal kit epicentre an illumina company the cdna libraries were created using the truseq rna sample prep kit in accordance with the standard protocol sequencing was performed on the illumina hiseq 4000 platform san diego ca usa by the majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china raw fastq data files were firstly uploaded to the mg rast joined using fastqjoin and further processed using the mg rast pipeline meyer et al 2008 broad agreement between results was derived from the megan and the mg rast sanders et al 2013 all described results were bioinformatically analyzed with respect to taxonomy and function with the following parameters in mg rast 10 5 e value 60 identity and a minimal alignment length of 15 amino acids the taxonomic affiliation of transcripts was assigned by the best hit classification through the non redundant multi source annotation database m5nr as annotation source functional analysis was determined by hierarchical classification by using the seed subsystem database as annotation source all datasets are now publicly available on mg rast table 1 2 4 gene expression pattern analyses all genes in the metatranscriptome data and genes that were annotated to dominant phyla were used to analyze expression patterns respectively differential expression analyses were conducted using edger package in accordance with the quasi likelihood pipeline chen et al 2016 they were normalized by the trimmed means of m values tmm method using the bioconductor edger package version 3 2 4 robinson and oshlack 2010 implemented in r r core team 2014 to account for differences in library sizes genes with cutoff of 0 5 for count per million cpm in at least two libraries were used for following analyses multi dimensional scaling mds plots were used to find out the distribution pattern of 12 rna samples then samples clustered in different groups were used to do different expression analysis multiple testing correction is performed using the benjamini hochberg method to control the false discovery rate fdr differential expression fold changes were considered significant at fdr adjusted p value 0 05 the pathway enrichment analysis of the differently expressed gene clusters was conducted using the clusterprofiler r package yu et al 2012 the comparecluster function of the clusterprofiler package was used to calculate and compare the enriched functional categories of each gene cluster to avoid underestimation of the enriched pathways we used phylum specific gene sets that were upregulated in each group as target genes and all the detected bacterial gene sets in 12 samples as background genes the significantly enriched pathways were selected on the basis of a threshold of 0 05 for q value 2 5 weighted gene co expression network analysis for rna seq data the weighted gene co expression network analysis was conducted by weighted correlation network analysis wgcna to examine co expression patterns between cyanobacteria and the dominant microbes langfelder and horvath 2008 wgcna clustered gene functions into modules designated by colors on the basis of their expression dissimilarity and demonstrated the correlation between each module and environmental variables genes related to cyanobacteria and dominant microbes were pooled together then genes with read coverage 100 reads for all groups were selected and normalized using the variance stabilizing transformation in deseq2 anders and huber 2010 then normalized read counts were clustered using wgcna with a soft threshold of 12 which was selected after a scale free network topology test the top 30 hub genes in each module and interactions between cyanobacteria and the associated bacteria in nitrogen phosphorus metabolism and cofactors vitamins were visualized using the cytoscape shannon et al 2003 3 results and discussion 3 1 environmental conditions in the meiliang bay of lake taihu water temperature increased gradually from 8 c in december 2015 to 33 c in july 2016 fig 1b chl a concentrations gradually increased from december to september with some fluctuations and then decreased in accordance with the definition of cyanobacterial bloom based on chl a concentrations xu et al 2015 the 12 months of a whole year could be divided into three stages including non february and march with chl a concentrations lower than 20 µg l 1 high july and september with chl a concentrations higher than 80 µg l 1 and low bloom other months with chl a concentrations varying between 20 and 60 µg l 1 periods fig 1b 3 2 composition of bacterial community revealed by 16s rrna gene amplicons bacterial community was dominated by cyanobacteria 43 3 97 1

dolichospermum formerly anabaena and unclassified subsections iii and iv of cyanobacteria were among the dominant cyanobacterial species dolichospermum only appeared in december 2015 and april 2016 confirming the dominance of dolichospermum in these two months in lake taihu shan et al 2019 unclassified cyanobacteria were only dominant in february and march when eukaryotic algae such as diatom were also dominant supplementary fig 1 during these two months non bloom period pure cyanobacterial colonies were difficult to collect due to their low biomass thus we collected particles larger than 120 μm to ensure sufficient sample for the following dna and rna extraction rhodococcus unclassified cytophagaceae unclassified alcaligenaceae and roseomonas were the dominant bacterial species fig 2b rhodococcus sp is reported to be able to degrade microcystin manage et al 2009 whereas other species are observed to be associated with cyanobacterial blooms shi et al 2018 cca revealed that chl a and tp concentrations do and temperature were the influencing factors on total bacterial community when cyanobacteria were involved fig 2c cca on bacterial communities excluding cyanobacterial sequences showed that bacterial communities were grouped into three clusters in accordance with adjacent months one cluster was composed of samples collected in february and march one cluster was composed of samples collected from august to november and another cluster was composed of the other months fig 2d toc no3 and po4 3 concentrations influenced the bacterial community structure most the result that the bacterial community in large cyanobacterial colonies was influenced by no3 was consistent with results of previous studies on bacteria attached to particles shi et al 2018 tang et al 2017 3 3 overview of metatranscriptomic data we recovered more than 88 5 putatively bacterial protein coding transcripts in most samples except 13 0 and 26 5 of sequences which were assigned to putatively bacterial protein coding transcripts in february and march 2017 respectively due to the dominance of eukaryotic algae such as diatom supplementary fig 1 in this study only bacterial metatranscriptomes were used for further analyses most bacterial mrna functional transcripts were derived from cyanobacteria 75 3 97 8 and proteobacteria 1 3 15 2 followed by firmicutes 0 2 2 7 bacteroidetes 0 1 2 5 and actinobacteria 0 2 1 7 fig 3 a the results showed that the relative abundance of mrna from cyanobacteria was much higher than that of their 16s rrna gene sequencing within cyanobacterial colonies the dominant mrna functional categories level 1 subsystem in all samples were photosynthesis protein metabolism carbohydrates clustering based subsystems amino acids and derivatives miscellaneous cofactors vitamins prosthetic groups pigments respiration rna metabolism and stress response fig 3b 3 4 gene expression pattern analyses all metatranscriptome data on gene function level were first analyzed by the mds plot by using edger which can give robust results even when the sample sizes are very small chen et al 2016 twelve rna samples were clustered into three dimensions which coincided with the three cyanobacterial bloom stages based on chl a concentration i e high july and september non february and march and low bloom other months groups fig 3c given that we usually divided annual cyanobacterial blooms into three phases including pre bloom from february to march bloom from april to september and post bloom from october to january periods zhu et al 2021 the division of the three groups in this study was interesting this result indicated that the microbial gene expression pattern in the large cyanobacterial colonies was dependent on chl a density and not strictly dependent on season this was like quorum sensing which is commonly in the phycosphere and is controlled by cell density for bacteria to coordinate their gene expressions rolland et al 2016 this result also indicated that the metabolic activities of large cyanobacterial colonies in spring april may and june and autumn october november and december were similar this feature was a good explanation for the occurrence of cyanobacterial bloom even in early winter which was because various cyanobacterial species had wide adaptation mechanisms to environmental changes as such the following differential expression analyses were based on these three groups the total bacterial metatranscriptomic data were prepared between high and non bloom low and non bloom and high and low bloom periods fig 3d 3f differential expression analysis on the specific gene functions of the top five phyla including cyanobacteria proteobacteria bacteroidetes actinobacteria and firmicutes were conducted table 2 the mds plot showed similar patterns between the gene expression levels of phyla and total bacteria and could be divided into the same three groups supplementary fig 2 a similar gene expression pattern indicated close metabolic links between cyanobacteria and these associated bacteria besides comparisons were made on the basis of different grouping schemes such as grouping in accordance with different seasons however no significant difference could be obtained among different groups data not shown gene functions with fold change 2 sde2 fdr p 0 05 between communities were used to prepare a volcano plot supplementary fig 3 the detailed information of differently expressed genes derived from specific phyla is shown in supplementary material 1 overall proteobacteria had the most while cyanobacteria had the minimal over represented genes in high and low bloom samples these results indicated that cyanobacteria had higher growth potential and faced more environmental stress during low and non bloom periods than during high bloom period 3 5 phylum specific enriched pathways in different bloom periods the dotplot shows enriched transcripts for pathways derived from different phyla at different bloom periods fig 4 briefly this result indicated high metabolic activity of the associated bacteria in cyanobacterial colonies during bloom periods including high and low bloom periods and labor divisions among these microbes for cyanobacteria the enriched accumulation of transcripts for pathways such as major pigment phycobilisome and chlorophyll co2 uptake and carbon metabolism and photosystem i were involved which are vital for high algal cell production fig 4a so the result was good explanation for maintenance of high cyanobacterial biomass in july and september during low bloom period the enriched accumulation of transcripts for pathways including histidine biosynthesis urea decomposition and molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis are good for the formation and maintenance of cyanobacterial colonies which have similar underlying mechanisms to biofilm shi et al 2022 histidine biosynthesis is a metabolic crossroad and plays an important role in cellular metabolism being interconnected to the de novo synthesis of purine and nitrogen metabolism fani et al 2007 these enriched pathways facilitate colony growth and proliferation for proteobacteria the accumulation of transcripts for pathways such as chemotaxis and flagellum sulfur and phosphorus metabolism increased during both high and low bloom periods fig 4b numerous studies showed that chemotaxis and flagellum are closely related to the nutrient acquisition of bacteria in addition chemotaxis and flagellum plays an important role in bacterial collective behavior such as biofilm formation and interaction with their hosts colin et al 2021 we speculate that during bloom period along with the formation and growth of cyanobacterial colony the chemotaxis and flagellum of proteobacteria are enhanced to increase the attachment to cyanobacterial colonies which contain rich nutrients at the same time the attachment of these bacteria may facilitate the maintenance of cyanobacterial colony structure and nutrient cycling during the bloom period shi et al 2022 given the mutualism and metabolic complementary relationships between cyanobacteria and the attached proteobacteria li et al 2018 and the phosphorus transference between microcystis and its attached bacteria jiang et al 2007 the increased bacterial phosphate metabolism is helpful for nutrient transformation which is beneficial for the rapid cell growth of cyanobacteria the occurrence of biological sulfur oxidation in the water column during cyanobacterial decomposition has been observed during high and low bloom periods the death and decomposition of high cyanobacterial biomass always happen thus the enriched sulfur oxidation may be good evidence for sulfur cycling during bloom period chen et al 2020 for bacteroidetes the numbers of enriched accumulated transcripts for pathways during low and non bloom period were more than that during high bloom period fig 4c transcripts for pathways such as bacterial cell division de novo purine biosynthesis and peptidoglycan biosynthesis were enriched during low bloom and non bloom period de novo purine biosynthesis support survival in niche environments that are limited in purine bioavailability and the role of the purine nucleotide biosynthesis on biofilm formation and symbiosis with organisms are widely reported kim et al 2014 peptidoglycan biosynthesis is vital for cell growth and disturbance of cell wall components such as peptidoglycan hampers biofilm formation bucher et al 2015 for actinobacteria transcripts for pathways such as ribosome lsu bacterial ribosome ssu bacterial methionine biosynthesis mycolic acid synthesis and de novo purine biosynthesis in the low bloom period are enriched fig 4d these results indicated higher activity of actinobacteria during the low bloom period for firmicutes transcripts for pathways such as arginine biosynthesis extended bacterial cell division de novo purine biosynthesis ribosome lsu bacterial ribosome ssu bacterial in the low bloom period are enriched fig 4e these results indicated that similar to actinobacteria firmicutes had high activity during the low bloom period therefore different microbial phyla enriched the accumulation of transcripts for different pathways during different bloom period thus the function differentiation of microbes in large cyanobacterial colonies may be a critical role for their overwhelming dominance and adaptation ability from warm conditions to cold conditions ma et al 2016 3 6 coordinated expression patterns in cyanobacteria and dominant phyla expression patterns were significantly coordinated between cyanobacteria and these dominant microbes with 1510 cyanobacterial and 1466 microbial genes clustered into 13 wgcna co expression modules fig 5 a the presence of genes from cyanobacteria and the dominant bacterial phyla within almost every significant co expression module suggested coordinated regulation across metabolic pathways in different phyla especially between cyanobacteria and proteobacteria this result indicated close relationships between cyanobacteria and proteobacteria and this finding was documented by many other scientists through other methods steffen et al 2012 zhu et al 2021 among the 13 modules the numbers of genes related to proteobacteria in modules turquoise meturquoise black meblack and yellow were higher than those to cyanobacteria whereas the opposite was observed in other modules fig 5a modules brown mebrown and green megreen harbored the highest number of genes related to photosynthesis and nitrogen metabolism respectively meturquoise harbored the highest number of genes related to membrane transport respiration rna metabolism cell wall and capsule dna metabolism protein metabolism carbohydrates cofactors vitamins prosthetic groups pigments clustering based subsystems amino acids and derivatives miscellaneous nucleosides and nucleotides and stress response fig 5b furthermore many metabolic processes such as cell wall and capsule dna metabolism protein metabolism carbohydrates cofactors and vitamins were present in almost all modules the co expression of genes related to cyanobacteria and the dominant phyla in these metabolic processes had been observed which confirmed the metabolic links between microbes in cyanobacterial colonies revealed by metagenomics methods cook et al 2020 li et al 2018 3 7 associations among modules genes and environmental factors mebrown was positively correlated with chl a concentration and temperature fig 5c megreen was positively correlated with tdp nh4 and no2 concentrations the module red mered was positively correlated with toc concentration and most positively correlated with do concentrations meblack was positively correlated with po4 3 concentration the module pink mepink was positively correlated with tp concentration by contrast meturquoise was significantly negatively related to chl a tn and tdn concentrations and ph fig 5c genes in different modules controlled by different environmental factors indicated varying gene response to environmental changes this finding was important for understanding the wide adaptation ability of cyanobacterial colonies as proposed by many algal physiological scientists carey et al 2012 in mebrown 29 of the top 30 hub genes were predominantly from cyanobacteria supplementary fig 4a among these 29 genes 6 were related to photosynthesis 4 were related to protein metabolism and 3 were related to amino acids and derivatives given that mebrown was positively correlated with chl a concentration and temperature increases in chl a concentration and temperature might result in or promote the expression of genes related to photosynthesis and respiration the positive relationship between these photosynthetic proteins and temperature might explain the finding that cyanobacterial bloom likes hot climate paerl and huisman 2008 in megreen 26 of the top 30 hub genes were predominantly from cyanobacteria supplementary fig 4b given that megreen was positively correlated with tdp nh4 and no2 concentrations these results indicated that the three environmental factors significantly influenced many metabolic processes in cyanobacteria nh4 can be a key factor in the determination of the distribution of cyanobacterial bloom in freshwater systems dai et al 2012 tdp is positively affected by total cyanobacterial biomass amorim et al 2020 no2 is a driving factor for cyanobacterial succession cai and kong 2013 in mered 20 of the top 30 hub genes were dominantly from cyanobacteria and 6 genes were from proteobacteria supplementary fig 4c toc concentration is remarkably influenced by cyanobacterial blooms and may be modified by bacteria ye et al 2015 these results indicated close association between the toc concentration and the metabolism of cyanobacteria and the four dominant bacterial phyla in meblack the top 30 hub genes 14 genes were related to protein metabolism were predominantly from proteobacteria except the one gene related to dna metabolism which was from cyanobacteria supplementary fig 4d given that meblack was positively correlated with po4 3 concentration these results indicated the significant influence of po4 3 on the protein metabolism of proteobacteria interestingly po4 3 directly influenced the metabolism of bacteria rather than cyanobacteria dip was commonly assumed to limit bacterial production indirectly by limiting phytoplankton which might limit the carbon available to bacteria however doc originating from allochthonous and autochthonous organic matters in lake taihu zhang et al 2011 and bacteria in the large cyanobacterial colonies may be limited by phosphorus rather than carbon in mepink 16 of the top 30 hub genes were dominantly from proteobacteria six genes related to carbohydrates miscellaneous and protein metabolism were from firmicutes 4 genes were from actinobacteria 2 genes were from bacteroidetes and 2 genes were from cyanobacteria supplementary fig 4e given that mepink was positively correlated with tp concentration these results indicated the influence of tp concentration on the growth and metabolism of all four dominant phyla particularly proteobacteria this result combined with the result of positive correlations between po4 3 concentration and meblack which was also dominated by proteobacteria suggested that phosphorus directly influenced proteobacteria rather than cyanobacteria in meturquoise among the top 30 hub genes 13 genes related to metabolisms such as photosynthesis nitrogen metabolism were affiliated to cyanobacteria supplementary fig 4f twelve genes were affiliated to proteobacteria four genes were from bacteroidetes one gene was from firmicutes given that meturquoise was significantly negatively related to chl a tn and tdn concentrations and ph these results indicated that the metabolic processes of cyanobacteria proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were regulated in response to combined changes in chl a tn and tdn concentrations and ph 3 8 significance of the interactions among cyanobacteria bacteria and environment in large cyanobacterial colonies in wgcna a topological overlap measure tom matrix reflecting the relative interconnectivity between two genes was calculated on the basis of the adjacent coefficient and the number of shared interacting partners between any pairs of co expressed genes langfelder and horvath 2008 based on this analysis metabolic links between cyanobacteria and the associated bacteria were observed here interconnections on three metabolisms such as phosphorus metabolism nitrogen metabolism cofactors vitamins prosthetic groups pigments with tom values higher than 0 1 were described as follows phosphorus metabolism in meturquoise the alkaline phosphatase and inorganic pyrophosphatase from proteobacteria and alkaline phosphatase and pyrophosphate energized proton pump from bacteroidetes were interconnected with many metabolisms such as photosystem ii respiration protein metabolism miscellaneous cell wall and capsule carbohydrates and nitrogen metabolism from cyanobacteria fig 6 by contrast the alkaline phosphatase from cyanobacteria was interconnected with exoribonuclease ii and type iii restriction modification system methylation subunit in rna metabolism and dna metabolism from firmicutes and proteobacteria alkaline phosphatase may make more inorganic phosphate available through degradation of organic matter cao et al 2009 gao et al 2006 results indicated that the associated bacteria through higher express of alkaline phosphatase to meet their phosphorus demand which might also benefit many metabolic pathways of cyanobacteria however cyanobacterial cells in a large colony might use dna or rna materials from the associated bacteria to meet their phosphorus demand in megreen the probable low affinity inorganic phosphate transporter from cyanobacteria was interconnected with many metabolisms of all the four associated bacterial phyla including miscellaneous carbohydrates membrane transport virulence disease and defense from firmicutes and proteobacteria amino acids and derivatives and clustering based subsystems from actinobacteria and cell wall and capsule stress response and clustering based subsystems from bacteroidetes in mepink an interconnection of high affinity phosphate transporter and control of pho regulon from proteobacteria and protein metabolism cell division and cell cycle amino acids and derivatives from cyanobacteria was observed high affinity and low affinity phosphate transporters can assimilate inorganic p under the p low and p rich conditions respectively hsieh and wanner 2010 megreen was significantly correlated with tdp concentration and had cyanobacteria dominated hub gene whereas mepink was significantly correlated with tp concentration and had proteobacteria dominated hub gene this result also indicated that cyanobacteria might use the dissolved phosphorus produced during the metabolic or mineralization process by the associated bacteria nitrogen metabolism in meturquoise ammonia assimilation from cyanobacteria were interconnected with many metabolic processes such as miscellaneous clustering based subsystems protein metabolism phosphorus metabolism virulence respiration and sulfur metabolism from all four associated bacterial phyla fig 6 in megreen nitrogen fixation and no3 and no2 ammonification by cyanobacteria were highly connected with many metabolic processes such as miscellaneous virulence disease and defense carbohydrates and cell wall and capsule from all four associated bacterial phyla fig 6 only in mered the nitric oxide synthase from actinobacteria was interconnected with many metabolic processes such as regulation and cell signaling stress response clustering based subsystems and protein metabolism from cyanobacteria interestingly an interconnection of nitrogen metabolism from other associated bacteria with other metabolic processes from cyanobacteria was not evident many studies revealed that the nitrogen cycling process was dominated by cyanobacteria and heterotrophic bacteria in lake taihu krausfeldt et al 2017 denitrification does not relieve the lake of excessive n inputs and cyanobacteria may thrive on newly supplied and previously loaded nitrogen sources to maintain its dominance in lake taihu paerl et al 2011 however this nitrogen cycling process by the associated bacteria was not evident in the investigated large buoyant cyanobacterial colonies given megreen was significantly correlated with nh4 and no2 concentrations and had cyanobacteria dominated hub gene these results indicated increased influence of nitrogen metabolisms by cyanobacteria on the associated bacteria than vice versa cofactors vitamins prosthetic groups pigments the nad consumption from firmicutes pterin biosynthesis from bacteroidetes and pterin biosynthesis riboflavin fmn and fad metabolism pyridoxin vitamin b6 biosynthesis biotin biosynthesis and so on from proteobacteria were interconnected with many cyanobacterial metabolic processes such as clustering based subsystems rna metabolism carbohydrates and photosynthesis fig 6 simultaneously some of cofactors and vitamin metabolism from cyanobacteria were interconnected with many metabolisms such as dna metabolism membrane transport and clustering based subsystems from bacteroidetes proteobacteria or firmicutes in meturquiose coenzyme b12 biosynthesis from proteobacteria was interconnected with riboflavin fmn and fad metabolism from cyanobacteria nad consumption from proteobacteria was interconnected with chlorophyll biosynthesis from cyanobacteria in megreen tocopherol biosynthesis pyridoxin vitamin b6 biosynthesis from proteobacteria were interconnected with coenzyme b12 biosynthesis ygfz iron biotin biosynthesis bilin biosynthesis and cobalamin synthesis from cyanobacteria in mered ubiquinone biosynthesis from proteobacteria was interconnected with folate biosynthesis from cyanobacteria besides many connections of cofactors vitamins prosthetic groups were observed within the same phylum for example in proteobacteria nad regulation 5 fcl like protein and ygfz were interconnected with heme and siroheme biosynthesis and pyridoxin vitamin b6 biosynthesis in cyanobacteria coenzyme b12 biosynthesis biotin biosynthesis cobalamin synthesis and molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis were interconnected with one another both cyanobacteria and bacteria have complex cofactor and vitamin metabolisms cook et al 2020 these results indicated interactions among vitamin metabolic processes and other metabolic processes may exist in the holobiont of these large cyanobacterial colonies metabolic links between cyanobacteria and the associated bacteria are documented through metagenomics cook et al 2020 li et al 2018 xie et al 2016 the microbial structure of cyanobacterial aggregates is revealed to be influenced by nitrogen and phosphorus through co pathways zhu et al 2021 vigorous cyanobacterial blooms remained in lake taihu in autumn or might even persist through winter ma et al 2016 our metatranscriptomic results showed that the similar metabolic activity of cyanobacteria and the associated bacteria in large cyanobacterial colonies in spring autumn or early winter well explained this phenomenon and indicated the wide adaptation of cyanobacterial colonies to temperature fluctuations furthermore gene functions clustered into different modules were dominated by different microbes and influenced by different environmental factors these results indicated that divisions of labor in large cyanobacterial aggregates where cyanobacterial activities were influenced by chl a temperature and nitrogen and bacterial activities were influenced by phosphorus therefore metabolic links among cyanobacteria the associated bacteria and environmental factors revealed in this study provided insight into the adaptation of cyanobacterial colonies to environmental changes overall the gene expression patterns of the dominant phyla including cyanobacteria proteobacteria bacteroidetes firmicutes and actinobacteria in large cyanobacterial colonies are illustrated in fig 7 4 conclusions monthly metatranscriptomic data showed that the gene expression patterns of microbes in large cyanobacterial colonies were not strictly separated by different seasons but were dependent on chl a density the enriched accumulation of transcripts for pathways from cyanobacteria and other microbes were different these results illustrated similar gene expression patterns but different metabolic responses of cyanobacteria and associated bacteria to different bloom intensities the coordinated pattern of cyanobacteria and the associated bacteria especially proteobacteria was observed modules had cyanobacteria dominated hub gene were positively correlated with chl a temperature tdp nh4 and toc concentrations modules had proteobacteria dominated hub gene were correlated with po4 3 and tp concentrations furthermore results elicited possible beneficial influence of phosphorus metabolism from the associated bacteria on cyanobacteria whereas more influence of nitrogen metabolisms from cyanobacteria on the associated bacteria complementary metabolisms of cofactors vitamins prosthetic groups pigments may exist among holobiont members in these large cyanobacterial colonies these results indicated labor division of microbe and their different responses to environmental factors in cyanobacterial colonies this finding might be one of the major reasons for surviving

15577,the generation of reactive oxygen species generally requires initiators in various environmental remediation processes which necessitates high dosage of activators and downstream treatment for eliminating the accumulation of deactivated catalysts herein a coupled process was constructed using trace iron for simultaneously activating hso3 o2 system and peroxydisulfate pds oxidation system where the iron ions 2 mg l transferred single electron from the former system to the latter due to the moderate redox potential fe3 fe2 0 77 v between the potentials of so3 hso3 0 63 v and pds so4 2 01 v hence the phenol degradation quickly occurred at a first order kinetic constant of k1 0 223 min 1 due to the accelerated generation of sulfate radical so4 and hydroxyl radical oh in the process the k1 value was almost 6 fold of that in the deoxygenated condition 0 040 min 1 density function theory reveals that the single electron shuttle spatially separates the electron donating activation of hso3 and electron accepting activation of pds while avoiding the mutual annihilation of hso3 and s2o8 2 via direct two electron transfer finally utilizing the in situ generated electron shuttle dissolved iron from cast iron pipe the hso3 pds reagent could efficiently inactivate the chlorine resistant pathogens and inhibits biofilm regrowth inside the distribution systems at regular intervals or infectious disease outbreak in a neighborhood keywords trace iron single electron shuttle radical production interdependent activation iron sludge reduction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction environmental remediation processes such as disinfection of drinking water distribution systems dwdss tertiary treatment of wastewater xu et al 2020 detoxifying inorganic compounds zhou et al 2013 and elimination of organic contamination in nature waters soil sun et al 2018 all require the employment of reactive oxygen species ros in general the booming output of ros for subsequent applications accompanied by chain reactions where various reactive species explosively interact is achievable via electron abstracting activation of parent compounds assisted by reductive initiators such as hydroxyl radical oh from fe ii activated hydrogen peroxide h2o2 fenton process sun et al 2018 sulfate radical so4 from transitional metal activated peroxydisulfate pds m fe co cu ag du et al 2016 luo et al 2021b matzek and carter 2016 soluble mn iii from bisulfite activated kmno4 sun et al 2016 problem comes from the role of the activator as a sacrifice in the processes the property necessitates a high dosage of the activator and downstream treatment for eliminating the accumulation of deactivated catalysts chen et al 2011 ji et al 2020 for instance using fe2 as the reductive activator single electron injection into the pds molecule could asymmetrically cleave the peroxide band for yielding so4 fenton like reaction zeng et al 2019 correspondingly resultant fe3 accumulated in the process which required costly disposal at the form of iron precipitation after neutralization analogue occurs to the bisulfite oxygen hso3 o2 oxidation systems that are initiated by oxidative activators such as fe iii yuan et al 2019 and cr vi dong et al 2020 in these processes the chain reactions were triggered by an electron donating reaction of hso3 for yielding sulfite radicals so3 followed by its utilization to convert o2 into so4 and corresponding reduction products fe ii cr iii were largely produced as deactivated catalysts for decreasing the demand for the sacrificial activators and avoiding the expensive downstream treatment of the deactivated catalysts in these processes we were intrigued by constructing a composite system that enables electron donating activation and simultaneously electron accepting activation via electron flow from the former process to the latter jun ma et al have investigated the hso3 pds system for the degradation of bisphenol a where the chain reactions were triggered by direct transfer of single electron from hso3 to pds qi et al 2017 however the composite system suffered from the narrow channel for sluggish transfer of electron impeding the further radical production and inducing impractical retention time for organic decontamination 84 7 removal in 360 min similar shackle occurred to the z scheme photocatalysis system where two photocatalysts were employed to independently split water into o2 and h2 iwase et al 2011 however the accumulation of photoelectron in the o2 photocatalyst and holes in the excited h2 photocatalyst impeded continuous generation of corresponding gas even they could electrically neutralize each other in a negligible speed sasaki et al 2009 without the sacrificial reagents the photocatalytic water splitting had never proceeded on continuous evolution of o2 or h2 kato et al 2004 the constraint was solved by introducing an electron mediator into the z scheme photocatalysis system to boost effective electron relay such as fe3 fe2 and io3 i redox couples abe et al 2005 higashi et al 2008 kato et al 2004 these electron transporters readily transferred photoelectron from o2 photocatalyst to h2 photocatalyst achieving a dynamic equilibrium between the electron accepting and electron donating abilities to simultaneously meet the necessities of two photocatalysis processes and ensuring a continuous flow of electrons between the electron deficient area and nucleophilic area correspondingly the z scheme photocatalytic system pt srtio3 rh bivo4 fe3 fe2 pair as electron shuttle continuously presented remarkable performance on the simultaneous generation of h2 and o2 generation rates 15 mmol h and 7 2 mmol h kato et al 2004 inspired by the critical role of electron shuttle for transporting electron inside the system we formulated a hypothesis that the electron shuttle can simultaneously initiate the electron donating activation and electron accepting activation by facilitating the electron relay from one process to the other inducing a continuous radical generation with trace catalyst herein we constructed a combined system of pds oxidation process and hso3 o2 process using fe3 fe2 redox pair as electron shuttle in the kinetic experiments phenol was selected as a probe of oh and so4 due to its high reactivity with these two radicals 6 6 109 m 1 s 1 for oh 8 8 109 m 1 s 1 for so4 zeng et al 2020 the contribution of these radicals was clarified by electron spin resonance esr analysis and quenching experiments the essential role of trace iron as single electron shuttle was explored using different electron shuttles and density function theory dft analysis for maximizing the so4 generation the electron transfer in the chain reactions was investigated by optimizing the operation parameters finally the system was applied to inactivate the pathogens inside the cast iron pipe and urgent remediation of pipe network microbial regrowth 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals a complete list of reagents is provided in text si 1 supporting information 2 2 setup and experiment solutions in this study were prepared using deionized di water resistivity 18 2 mω arium pro system solution ph regulation was performed using naoh or h2so4 batch experiments were conducted in beakers with continuously purging n2 o2 or air 2 3 analytical method the concentration of phenol was measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc shimadzu lc 20ad tokyo japan with a c18 column and ultraviolet detector the mobile phase was maintained at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min with a constant ratio 20 80 of pure water and methanol the temperature of column was kept at 35 c and the maximum adsorption wavelength at 272 nm was selected the pds concentration and hso3 concentration was determined colorimetrically using modified iodometry at a wavelength of 352 nm by ultraviolet spectrophotometer lambda 45 perkinelmer zeng et al 2016 and the detection method was described in detail text si 2 the formation of reactive oxygen species ros was identified with an esr spectrometer cms 8400 adani for oh and so4 measurements the sample was immediately mixed with dmpo to form adducts 2 4 dft analysis all of the calculations were performed with the gaussian09 package geometry optimization of all the minima and transition states involved was carried out at the b3lyp level with 6 31g d for h o and s default convergence criteria were used the vibrational frequency calculations were conducted at the same level of theory as geometry optimization to confirm whether each optimized structure was an energy minimum or a saddle point for each transition state intrinsic reaction coordinate irc analysis was performed to verify whether it connected the right reactants and products on the potential energy surface the solvent effects were considered using the pcm model with the gas phase optimized structures as the initial geometries 2 5 simulated drinking water distribution systems set up and operation in the experiments the simulated drinking water distribution systems dwdss were simulated by annular reactors with around 3 days retention time as our previous study xing et al 2018c in order to simulate the actual pipe network environment tin foil is used to block and avoid light during the actual experimental operation the water samples derived from a drinking water treatment plant in southern china were treated with naclo disinfection for 1 h and then

measurements were conducted by a cary eclipse fluorescence spectrometer agilent technologies 3 results discussion 3 1 accelerated generation of reactive oxygen species initially we conducted an experiment to investigate feasibility of phenol degradation cinitial 2 ppm in the hso3 fe3 pds system under the anaerobic conditions i e in addition to hso3 2 mm fe3 2 ppm and pds 1 mm the reaction system was deoxygenated by purging n2 into the system solution ph 3 0 as shown in fig 1 a 90 56 of phenol in the system was degraded at a first order kinetic constant of 0 040 min 1 k1 r2 0 997 whereas the fe3 pds hso3 fe3 and hso3 pds systems presented ignorable degradation on phenol interestingly the k1 value in the hso3 fe3 pds system was higher than the sum of k1 values in other binary systems fig 1c indicative of a synergetic enhancement on the oxidation capacity among these three components phenanthroline spectrophotometric results revealed that fe2 occurred in the presence of hso3 hso3 fe3 and hso3 fe3 pds systems fe2 pds has proven to be an efficient combination for outputting so4 and oh accompanied by the accumulation of generated fe3 zeng et al 2019 given the fact that only slight degradation of phenol was observed in the fe2 pds system 6 9 removal efficiency in 60 min it was deducible that hso3 could induce continuous regeneration of fe2 for pds activation fig 1d which was similar to the hydroxylamine that induced the fe2 pds system li et al 2020 then the effect of the dissolved oxygen on the ros generation of the hso3 fe3 pds system was investigated by varying the atmosphere from n2 to air and o2 the half life of phenol decreased from 17 6 min to 12 7 min and 3 2 min fig 1b specifically the k1 value 0 223 min 1 of hso3 fe3 pds system for treating oxygenated water was almost 6 fold of that in the deoxygenated condition 0 040 min 1 fig 1c it has been well documented that hso3 fe3 pair presented oxidation capacity under the aerobic conditions yuan et al 2019 where formed so3 which could activate o2 followed by the generation of so5 and so4 fig 1d as shown in the fig 1b phenol degradation was observed with 21 30 ratio in 20 min k1 0 018 min 1 then entered a slow phase about 10 in 40 min which was ascribed to the fe3 consumption in the rapid phase and slow regeneration in the second phase unexpectedly the k1 value being higher in the o2 hso3 fe3 pds system 0 223 min 1 than the sum of that in o2 hso3 fe3 system k1 0 018 min 1 and hso3 fe3 pds system 0 040 min 1 may indicate a synergy on generation of ros which may be contributed to the superfast fe3 fe2 cycle then the esr technology and quenching experiments were employed to further indentify the reactive intermediates in the processes as shown in fig 2 a negligible signals were observed in the fe3 pds system while some strong signals occurred in the hso3 fe3 and hso3 fe3 pds systems given that these processes involved several radicals the esr spectra were simulated by standard spectra of dmpo oh and dmpo so3 fig 2b luo et al 2022 ranguelova et al 2012 in the analysis dmpo oh could derive from the unstable dmpo so4 and oh derived from the so4 reaction 9 and 10 zamora and villamena 2012 so the dmpo oh could stand for the total concentration of oh so4 the simulation demonstrated the coexistence of so3 and oh so4 in the hso3 fe3 process which has been verified by previous literatures yuan et al 2019 zamora and villamena 2012 with the addition of pds the intensities of dmpo oh and dmpo so3 increased by 2 5 and 3 0 times respectively both so3 and oh so4 were initiated by the iron cycle so the huge elevation in both radicals may verify the enhanced iron cycle from the perspective of reactive radicals quenching experiments further verified the co existence of oh so4 using ethanol for inhibiting oh and so4 and tba for inhibiting oh as scavengers zeng et al 2020 as shown in the fig si 1 both scavengers could obviously impede the phenol degradation by hso3 fe3 pds systems oxygenated condition with addition of 2 5 mm and 25 mm ethanol the k1 value of phenol degradation attenuated from 0 223 min 1 to 0 110 min 1 and 0 112 min 1 while it was decreased to 0 044 min 1 and 0 011 min 1 with tba addition fig 2c comparing the results demonstrated that both so4 and oh involved the phenol degradation in the system where oh was generally attributed to the conversion from so4 reaction 9 or 10 neta et al 1988 3 2 pivotal role of dissolved iron as single electron shuttle jun ma et al have investigated the hso3 pds system for the degradation of bisphenol a where the chain reactions were triggered via direct electron transfer qi et al 2017 in default of stable channel for shuttling electron from hso3 to pds both hso3 o2 system and pds oxidation system were initiated at a negligible rate k1 0 004 min 1 fig 3 a with the addition of trace iron 1 mg l the phenol degradation was significantly improved and the increasing performance on the phenol degradation and pds hso3 consumption fig si 2 text si 2 with an elevating concentration of iron suggested the essential role of iron catalyst for enhancing the electron transfer in the process similar enhancement occurred to co3 co2 addition into the hso3 pds system with k1 improvement of phenol degradation from 0 004 min 1 w o metal in the system to 0 314 min 1 fig 3b while another two single electron initiators cr3 cr2 and cu2 cu exhibited negligible influence on the oxidation process fig si 3 thermodynamically only when the redox potential of electron carrier was higher than that of one reactant and lower than that of the other could the electron shuttle continuously mediate the electron from the electron donor to electron acceptor van der zee and cervantes 2009 so the co3 co2 couple eɵ 1 82 v and fe3 fe2 pair eɵ 0 77 v could shuttle the single electron from hso3 eɵ so3 hso3 0 63 v to pds eɵ pds so4 2 01 v by forming continuous redox cycle and the redox potentials of cr3 cr2 eɵ 0 42 v and cu2 cu eɵ 0 16 v have obviously been outside the redox window 0 63 2 01 v bratsch 1989 huie and neta 1984 williams 1996 inspired by the electron shuttle in vivo which enabled the charge transport cross the bio membrane we further explained the spatial separation property of electron donating process and electron accepting process by dft analysis ma et al 2015 in the analysis a hyphen stood for the states where two units bonded with each other whereas the space presented the separate state as shown in fig 3c hso3 firstly adducted with s2o8 2 then it was transformed into transition state ts1 with gibbs free energy change g of 0 795 ev the positive value indicated a demand on energy input for ensuring the occurrence of elementary reaction later a hso4 so3 so4 adduct was formed from ts1 followed by in situ yield of hso4 so3 and so4 ga 0 232 ev where single electron transfer occurred in this step however if the decomposition was induced by two electron transfer hso4 so4 2 and so3 were produced with a negative gb 11 24 ev in the process indicating that the two electron transfer reaction could proceed spontaneously above analysis indicated that the direct reaction of hso3 with s2o8 2 could readily consume the redox capacity of each other instead of the formation of radicals finally the step where ts was formed was confirmed as the determining step through the reaction channel due to its highest positive g among these elementary reactions gds1 zhou et al 2019 only when the system overcame the uphill energy barrier activation energy did the reaction proceed fluently more specifically the determining step became the neck of the funnel for kinetics of so3 so4 production determining the kinetic constant for the whole process according to the arrhenius equation wei et al 2012 in the presence of iron fe3 fe2 redox pair could abstract electron from hso3 and donate electron to s2o8 2 in turn fig 3d accompanied by ex situ production of so4 radical and h so3 hso3 radical through the whole process the determining step in fig 3d was confirmed as the transformation stage of fe2 s2o8 2 to transition state 2 with an increasing gibbs free energy gds2 0 576 ev suggesting higher kinetic constant for producing desired so3 so4 radical in presence of iron comparing the dft results in two systems demonstrated that the employment of the fe3 fe2 cycle as electron shuttle not only paves a steady approach for single electron transfer between hso3 and pds due to the proper redox potential but also spatially separates the electron donation process and electron acception process while avoiding the mutual annihilation of hso3 and s2o8 2 via two electron transfer mechanism fig 3e 3 3 tuning the electron transfer inside chain reactions for maximizing so4 generation the chain reactions can be readily oriented to different radical configurations by tuning the composition parameters in the oxidation system li et al 2020 luo et al 2021a for instance fe3 h2o2 mainly forms oh using hydroxylamine or mos2 as electron donor for accelerating fe iii fe ii cycle chen et al 2011 xing et al 2018a whereas it yields singlet oxygen 1o2 employing metallic molybdenum as co catalyst yi et al 2019 analyzing the electron flow in the chain reactions facilitates subsequent manipulations on the operational mode herein various peroxide compounds were firstly explored for coupling the hso3 fe iii system unfortunately the performance on the hso3 fe iii system with addition of h2o2 or peroxymonosulfate pms oxygenated conditions was far inferior to that in our system fig si 4 which was aroused from the fast scavenging of h2o2 pms by hso3 via two electron route table 1 reaction 2 3 brandt and vaneldik 1995 kunen et al 1983 vincent et al 1998 the deviation of electron relay from the single electron transfer via electron shuttle fe3 fe2 cycle impeded the generation of ros due that the reagents have been consumed in contrast experimental data demonstrated pds to be relatively inert toward hso3 in the absence of electron shuttle reaction 1 the kinetic constant of hso3 with pds was also estimated as only 0 271 m 1s 1 by density function theory analysis text si 3 which was several magnitudes lower than those with h2o2 pms microscopically the generation of fe2 from fe3 should follow the complexation of fe3 reductant e g feso3 at the level of elementary reaction and the decomplexation of the transition state accompanied by the fe2 release has been revealed to positively affect the subsequent pds activation hso3 fe3 pds route li et al 2020 it has been well documented that fe3 could form various adducts with hso3 as solution ph varies including feso3 feso3h2 fe oh so3 and feso3h oh brandt and vaneldik 1995 the distribution of various fe3 hso3 adducts in the buffered solutions were simulated and analyzed by a chemical speciation model visual minteq software version 3 1 by varying the solution ph according to the results table si 1 only feso3 and fe oh so3 appeared under the conditions meanwhile the fe oh so3 concentration increased with an elevation of solution ph from 2 0 to 7 0 fig 4 b whereas the concentration of feso3 presented a declining trend correspondently a decrease of the operational ph from 7 0 to 2 0 induced an increasing k1 of phenol degradation from 0 min 1 to 0 059 min 1 fig 4b indicating that feso3 adduct exhibited faster decomplexation rate than fe oh so3 as well as efficient generation of reactive fe2 brandt and vaneldik 1995 the consistency between degradation kinetics of phenol anaerobic condition and feso3 concentration as functions of solution ph further proved the fe2 formation from the decomplexation of fe3 hso3 adducts to be the pivotal part in hso3 fe3 pds route furthermore the aerobic conditions could enhance the pivotal step and accelerate the generation of radicals guo et al 2013 afterwards the resultant so3 exhibited several possibilities to form desired precursor of ros so5 reaction 7 fe2 reaction 12 activate the pds reaction 11 text si 3 2 or induce a self quenching by other radicals reaction 13 14 for better understanding the proportion of different reaction routes concentrations of so3 so4 and so5 were estimated by kinetics simulation text si 4 then the reaction rate could be expressed as following reaction 7 r s o 3 k s o 3 o 2 4 2 1 0 5 s 1 s o 3 reaction 13 r s o 3 k s o 3 s o 3 0 123 s 1 s o 3 reaction 14 r s o 3 k s o 3 s o 4 1 61 1 0 14 s 1 s o 3 it is obviously that the rate of so3 with o2 was several orders of magnitude higher than those with other radicals so3 and so4 indicating the side reactions were self inhibited due to their low concentration in the system analogue analysis text si 2 was implemented and revealed that the destiny of so5 was mainly steered toward reaction with hso3 as well as formation of so4 reaction 8 as shown in fig 4c although the chain reactions showed high complexity on various mutual reactions in table 1 the system could be readily steered toward maximizing so4 production just by tuning the operation parameters such as the choice of peroxide compounds adjustment of ph levels and external addition of reactants 3 4 hso3 pds system for eliminating microbial risks of drinking water distribution systems using in situ generated electron shuttle for evaluating the application potential the hso3 fe3 s2o8 2 system was applied to urgently eliminate microbial risks of the drinking water distribution systems dwdss which actually harbored an astonishing number of pathogenic bacteria causing a large number of outbreaks and elevated clinical cases in the actual pipe network the mature biofilm did act many roles including boosting bacterial aggregations sustaining the stability of microbial aggregates providing nutrients for metabolism and endangering tap water security hence the use of chlorine disinfection was ineffective and problematic for the inactivation and inhibition of pathogenic bacteria liu et al 2016 wang et al 2013b wang et al 2012 xing et al 2018b zhang et al 2021 compared to fecal source pathogens opportunistic pathogens ops can multiply in the biofilm attached to the pipe material even in the presence of high chlorine residuals due to a large number of characteristics such as growth in amoebae growth at low organic carbon concentrations extracellular polymeric substance production etc wang et al 2013b xing et al 2018c for example acanthamoeba polyphaga cysts were able to protect legionella from at least 50 mg l free chlorine which was much higher than residual chlorine concentration at the end of pipe network around 0 05 mg l kilvington and price 1990 therefore chlorine disinfection wound not work for the microbial contamination emergency in the pipeline from a certain block for better simulating conditions of actual dwdss the annular reactors were loaded with 20 cast iron coupons and covered with tin foil to avoid light in the experiment the raw water samples flew into the simulated dwdss with up flow mode and the retention time was around 2 weeks simulating hydraulic condition in the actual pipeline with microbial risk generally atp was an important indicator to be considered as a measure of the activity or energy status of microbes with addition of hso3 and pds into system oxygenated atmosphere the atp concentration of bulk water in dwdss decreased sharply from 0 998 nmol l to 0 533 nmol l at 10 min finally stabilized at 0 170 nmol l fig 5 b fig si 7 indicating effective inhibition of microbial activity the typical ops in the process were further monitored by qpcr due to their emerging threat to public health wang et al 2013a at 0 min the gene copy numbers of legionella spp mycobacterium spp legionella pneumophila mycobacterium spp mycobacterium avium naegleria spp naegleria fowleri pseudomonas aeruginosa hartmanella vermiformis and acanthamoeba spp in the bulk water of dwdss were 3 72 106 9 55 103 7 59 106 6 03 103 1 12 106 3 72 103 6 17 105 1 95 105 and 1 45 107 gene copies ml fig 5c respectively after dosing na2so3 and pds the abundances of these ops dramatically decreased by 4 5 orders of magnitude in only 10 min and they were completely inactivated at 30 h by contrast the system showed negligible influence on these two indicators with dosing individual hso3 or pds fig 5b fig si 8 and fig si 9 the admirable performance could be ascribed to the ultrafast radical production in the hso3 fe3 pds system this was verified by the quenching experiments using 10 mm l histidine which has been proven to be an efficient scavenger for oh and so4 and harmless to microorganism with the inhibitory effect of l histidine on the radical atp decreased and the sterilization of monitored ops by radical was inhibited meanwhile fig si 10 eem results indicated that soluble microbial products peak a and protein peak b were significantly removed as reaction time increased fig 5f interestingly the slight increase of protein at 30 h was probably attributed to the cleavage of biofilms on the other hand humic acid like peak c and peak d and fulvic acid like substances peak e declined greatly in the process of reaction indicating that ubiquitous natural organic matter nom did not have adverse effects on environmental remediation and nom derived disinfections by productions could also be effectively inhibited yang et al 2021 the above results verified that pds completely eliminated the risk of pathogenic bacteria and the potential of microbial regrowth in dwdss using pre existing iron particles interestingly even without iron addition the hso3 pds system still exhibited admirable performance on destroying the biofilm inside the cast iron reactor which was controversy to our conclusion that the ultrafast output of radicals in the hso3 pds system was induced by the single electron shuttling mediated by iron cycle by icp oes analysis the iron concentration in the effluent was determined as 1 93 mg l which may root from the iron cast particles the cast iron particles in the reactor were collected before and after the treatment and the samples were analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps fig 5d the fe 2p spectrum of samples exhibited two major peaks centered at 711 6 and 724 9 ev which represented fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 respectively the peaks at 710 2 and 723 1 ev ascribed to fe2 whereas the peaks that correspond to 711 6 713 8 724 9 and 727 6 ev were assigned to fe3 wang et al 2021 it was obvious that both the intensity of both fe2 and fe3 weakened after reaction according to the element analysis the fe element relative ratio on the surface of cast iron particles decreased from 18 13 to 13 11 fig 5e indicating iron element shifted from the particle surface iron oxide to the bulk solution dissolved iron the dissolved iron from cast iron particles played a pivotal role of electron shuttle in the hso3 pds system therefore the disinfection was highly suppressed when the particles were removed at the beginning fig si 11 it should be mentioned that the wastewater should be emitted to the wastewater treatment plant the sulfate ions and trace iron in the system won t contaminate the drinking water by this way in the environmental remediation processes radical production via fenton or fenton like reactions has long suffered from the impractical requirement on stoichiometrically equivalent addition of sacrificial catalysts and their downstream treatment in this work the trace iron 2 0 mg l presented strong capacity to simultaneously activate two oxidation systems and continuously outputting a large number of free radicals owing to its capacity to shuttle single electron and spatially separate electro donating half reaction and electron accepting half reaction it is noticeable that 2 0 mg l iron in the effluent meets the municipal wastewater emission standard of several countries table si 2 indicating that the effluent can be directly emitted to the natural waters without necessity for post treatment of dissolved iron compared to the traditionally homogenous aops fenton fenton like processes the property could avoid the downstream treatment of the iron sludge and reduce the economic input furthermore as fourth most common element in the earth s crust iron element at the form of iron oxide is ubiquitous around the human footprint which readily enters the aqueous system and initiates the coupled oxidation processes at the form of dissolved iron this was verified by the application case of hso3 pds pair for inactivating the pathogens and inhibiting biofilm regrowth inside the distribution systems and might also applied to other environmental remediation processes unfortunately although the acidification of hso3 fe3 pds system as a pds based oxidation process could alleviate the negative effect of neutral alkaline condition zeng et al 2016 the new system can t still break the shackles of homogeneously iron based aops namely the narrow range of applicable solution ph sun et al 2018 it has been well documented that the addition of chelating agents e g edta could highly improve the solubility of iron ions at neutral alkaline condition and tune their existing species pan et al 2018 which may extend the applicable solution ph of new system and should be further investigated 4 conclusion in this study a coupled process was constructed using trace iron for simultaneously activating hso3 o2 system and peroxydisulfate pds oxidation system under the oxygenated condition the phenol degradation by hso3 fe3 pds system quickly occurred at a first order kinetic constant of k1 0 2225 min 1 which was almost 6 fold of that in the n2 atmosphere 0 0395 min 1 the improved performance on the degradation of model contaminant could be ascribed to the ultrafast generation of so4 and oh in the process where the iron ions 2 mg l transferred single electron from the former system to the latter due to the moderate redox potential fe3 fe2 0 77 v between the potentials of so3 hso3 0 63 v and pds so4 2 01 v density function theory reveals that the single electron shuttle spatially separates the electron donating activation of hso3 and electron accepting activation of pds while avoiding the mutual annihilation of hso3 and s2o8 2 via direct two electron transfer the system could be readily steered toward maximizing so4 production just by tuning the operation parameters such as the choice of peroxide compounds adjustment of ph levels and external addition of reactants finally utilizing the in situ generated electron shuttle dissolved iron from cast iron pipe the hso3 pds reagent could efficiently inactivate the chlorine

15577,the generation of reactive oxygen species generally requires initiators in various environmental remediation processes which necessitates high dosage of activators and downstream treatment for eliminating the accumulation of deactivated catalysts herein a coupled process was constructed using trace iron for simultaneously activating hso3 o2 system and peroxydisulfate pds oxidation system where the iron ions 2 mg l transferred single electron from the former system to the latter due to the moderate redox potential fe3 fe2 0 77 v between the potentials of so3 hso3 0 63 v and pds so4 2 01 v hence the phenol degradation quickly occurred at a first order kinetic constant of k1 0 223 min 1 due to the accelerated generation of sulfate radical so4 and hydroxyl radical oh in the process the k1 value was almost 6 fold of that in the deoxygenated condition 0 040 min 1 density function theory reveals that the single electron shuttle spatially separates the electron donating activation of hso3 and electron accepting activation of pds while avoiding the mutual annihilation of hso3 and s2o8 2 via direct two electron transfer finally utilizing the in situ generated electron shuttle dissolved iron from cast iron pipe the hso3 pds reagent could efficiently inactivate the chlorine resistant pathogens and inhibits biofilm regrowth inside the distribution systems at regular intervals or infectious disease outbreak in a neighborhood keywords trace iron single electron shuttle radical production interdependent activation iron sludge reduction data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction environmental remediation processes such as disinfection of drinking water distribution systems dwdss tertiary treatment of wastewater xu et al 2020 detoxifying inorganic compounds zhou et al 2013 and elimination of organic contamination in nature waters soil sun et al 2018 all require the employment of reactive oxygen species ros in general the booming output of ros for subsequent applications accompanied by chain reactions where various reactive species explosively interact is achievable via electron abstracting activation of parent compounds assisted by reductive initiators such as hydroxyl radical oh from fe ii activated hydrogen peroxide h2o2 fenton process sun et al 2018 sulfate radical so4 from transitional metal activated peroxydisulfate pds m fe co cu ag du et al 2016 luo et al 2021b matzek and carter 2016 soluble mn iii from bisulfite activated kmno4 sun et al 2016 problem comes from the role of the activator as a sacrifice in the processes the property necessitates a high dosage of the activator and downstream treatment for eliminating the accumulation of deactivated catalysts chen et al 2011 ji et al 2020 for instance using fe2 as the reductive activator single electron injection into the pds molecule could asymmetrically cleave the peroxide band for yielding so4 fenton like reaction zeng et al 2019 correspondingly resultant fe3 accumulated in the process which required costly disposal at the form of iron precipitation after neutralization analogue occurs to the bisulfite oxygen hso3 o2 oxidation systems that are initiated by oxidative activators such as fe iii yuan et al 2019 and cr vi dong et al 2020 in these processes the chain reactions were triggered by an electron donating reaction of hso3 for yielding sulfite radicals so3 followed by its utilization to convert o2 into so4 and corresponding reduction products fe ii cr iii were largely produced as deactivated catalysts for decreasing the demand for the sacrificial activators and avoiding the expensive downstream treatment of the deactivated catalysts in these processes we were intrigued by constructing a composite system that enables electron donating activation and simultaneously electron accepting activation via electron flow from the former process to the latter jun ma et al have investigated the hso3 pds system for the degradation of bisphenol a where the chain reactions were triggered by direct transfer of single electron from hso3 to pds qi et al 2017 however the composite system suffered from the narrow channel for sluggish transfer of electron impeding the further radical production and inducing impractical retention time for organic decontamination 84 7 removal in 360 min similar shackle occurred to the z scheme photocatalysis system where two photocatalysts were employed to independently split water into o2 and h2 iwase et al 2011 however the accumulation of photoelectron in the o2 photocatalyst and holes in the excited h2 photocatalyst impeded continuous generation of corresponding gas even they could electrically neutralize each other in a negligible speed sasaki et al 2009 without the sacrificial reagents the photocatalytic water splitting had never proceeded on continuous evolution of o2 or h2 kato et al 2004 the constraint was solved by introducing an electron mediator into the z scheme photocatalysis system to boost effective electron relay such as fe3 fe2 and io3 i redox couples abe et al 2005 higashi et al 2008 kato et al 2004 these electron transporters readily transferred photoelectron from o2 photocatalyst to h2 photocatalyst achieving a dynamic equilibrium between the electron accepting and electron donating abilities to simultaneously meet the necessities of two photocatalysis processes and ensuring a continuous flow of electrons between the electron deficient area and nucleophilic area correspondingly the z scheme photocatalytic system pt srtio3 rh bivo4 fe3 fe2 pair as electron shuttle continuously presented remarkable performance on the simultaneous generation of h2 and o2 generation rates 15 mmol h and 7 2 mmol h kato et al 2004 inspired by the critical role of electron shuttle for transporting electron inside the system we formulated a hypothesis that the electron shuttle can simultaneously initiate the electron donating activation and electron accepting activation by facilitating the electron relay from one process to the other inducing a continuous radical generation with trace catalyst herein we constructed a combined system of pds oxidation process and hso3 o2 process using fe3 fe2 redox pair as electron shuttle in the kinetic experiments phenol was selected as a probe of oh and so4 due to its high reactivity with these two radicals 6 6 109 m 1 s 1 for oh 8 8 109 m 1 s 1 for so4 zeng et al 2020 the contribution of these radicals was clarified by electron spin resonance esr analysis and quenching experiments the essential role of trace iron as single electron shuttle was explored using different electron shuttles and density function theory dft analysis for maximizing the so4 generation the electron transfer in the chain reactions was investigated by optimizing the operation parameters finally the system was applied to inactivate the pathogens inside the cast iron pipe and urgent remediation of pipe network microbial regrowth 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals a complete list of reagents is provided in text si 1 supporting information 2 2 setup and experiment solutions in this study were prepared using deionized di water resistivity 18 2 mω arium pro system solution ph regulation was performed using naoh or h2so4 batch experiments were conducted in beakers with

ultraviolet detector the mobile phase was maintained at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min with a constant ratio 20 80 of pure water and methanol the temperature of column was kept at 35 c and the maximum adsorption wavelength at 272 nm was selected the pds concentration and hso3 concentration was determined colorimetrically using modified iodometry at a wavelength of 352 nm by ultraviolet spectrophotometer lambda 45 perkinelmer zeng et al 2016 and the detection method was described in detail text si 2 the formation of reactive oxygen species ros was identified with an esr spectrometer cms 8400 adani for oh and so4 measurements the sample was immediately mixed with dmpo to form adducts 2 4 dft analysis all of the calculations were performed with the gaussian09 package geometry optimization of all the minima and transition states involved was carried out at the b3lyp level with 6 31g d for h o and s default convergence criteria were used the vibrational frequency calculations were conducted at the same level of theory as geometry optimization to confirm whether each optimized structure was an energy minimum or a saddle point for each transition state intrinsic reaction coordinate irc analysis was performed to verify whether it connected the right reactants and products on the potential energy surface the solvent effects were considered using the pcm model with the gas phase optimized structures as the initial geometries 2 5 simulated drinking water distribution systems set up and operation in the experiments the simulated drinking water distribution systems dwdss were simulated by annular reactors with around 3 days retention time as our previous study xing et al 2018c in order to simulate the actual pipe network environment tin foil is used to block and avoid light during the actual experimental operation the water samples derived from a drinking water treatment plant in southern china were treated with naclo disinfection for 1 h and then

experiment to investigate feasibility of phenol degradation cinitial 2 ppm in the hso3 fe3 pds system under the anaerobic conditions i e in addition to hso3 2 mm fe3 2 ppm and pds 1 mm the reaction system was deoxygenated by purging n2 into the system solution ph 3 0 as shown in fig 1 a 90 56 of phenol in the system was degraded at a first order kinetic constant of 0 040 min 1 k1 r2 0 997 whereas the fe3 pds hso3 fe3 and hso3 pds systems presented ignorable degradation on phenol interestingly the k1 value in the hso3 fe3 pds system was higher than the sum of k1 values in other binary systems fig 1c indicative of a synergetic enhancement on the oxidation capacity among these three components phenanthroline spectrophotometric results revealed that fe2 occurred in the presence of hso3 hso3 fe3 and hso3 fe3 pds systems fe2 pds has proven to be an efficient combination for outputting so4 and oh accompanied by the accumulation of generated fe3 zeng et al 2019 given the fact that only slight degradation of phenol was observed in the fe2 pds system 6 9 removal efficiency in 60 min it was deducible that hso3 could induce continuous regeneration of fe2 for pds activation fig 1d which was similar to the hydroxylamine that induced the fe2 pds system li et al 2020 then the effect of the dissolved oxygen on the ros generation of the hso3 fe3 pds system was investigated by varying the atmosphere from n2 to air and o2 the half life of phenol decreased from 17 6 min to 12 7 min and 3 2 min fig 1b specifically the k1 value 0 223 min 1 of hso3 fe3 pds system for treating oxygenated water was almost 6 fold of that in the deoxygenated condition 0 040 min 1 fig 1c it has been well documented that hso3 fe3 pair presented oxidation capacity under the aerobic conditions yuan et al 2019 where formed so3 which could activate o2 followed by the generation of so5 and so4 fig 1d as shown in the fig 1b phenol degradation was observed with 21 30 ratio in 20 min k1 0 018 min 1 then entered a slow phase about 10 in 40 min which was ascribed to the fe3 consumption in the rapid phase and slow regeneration in the second phase unexpectedly the k1 value being higher in the o2 hso3 fe3 pds system 0 223 min 1 than the sum of that in o2 hso3 fe3 system k1 0 018 min 1 and hso3 fe3 pds system 0 040 min 1 may indicate a synergy on generation of ros which may be contributed to the superfast fe3 fe2 cycle then the esr technology and quenching experiments were employed to further indentify the reactive intermediates in the processes as shown in fig 2 a negligible signals were observed in the fe3 pds system while some strong signals occurred in the hso3 fe3 and hso3 fe3 pds systems given that these processes involved several radicals the esr spectra were simulated by standard spectra of dmpo oh and dmpo so3 fig 2b luo et al 2022 ranguelova et al 2012 in the analysis dmpo oh could derive from the unstable dmpo so4 and oh derived from the so4 reaction 9 and 10 zamora and villamena 2012 so the dmpo oh could stand for the total concentration of oh so4 the simulation demonstrated the coexistence of so3 and oh so4 in the hso3 fe3 process which has been verified by previous literatures yuan et al 2019 zamora and villamena 2012 with the addition of pds the intensities of dmpo oh and dmpo so3 increased by 2 5 and 3 0 times respectively both so3 and oh so4 were initiated by the iron cycle so the huge elevation in both radicals may verify the enhanced iron cycle from the perspective of reactive radicals quenching experiments further verified the co existence of oh so4 using ethanol for inhibiting oh and so4 and tba for inhibiting oh as scavengers zeng et al 2020 as shown in the fig si 1 both scavengers could obviously impede the phenol degradation by hso3 fe3 pds systems oxygenated condition with addition of 2 5 mm and 25 mm ethanol the k1 value of phenol degradation attenuated from 0 223 min 1 to 0 110 min 1 and 0 112 min 1 while it was decreased to 0 044 min 1 and 0 011 min 1 with tba addition fig 2c comparing the results demonstrated that both so4 and oh involved the phenol degradation in the system where oh was generally attributed to the conversion from so4 reaction 9 or 10 neta et al 1988 3 2 pivotal role of dissolved iron as single electron shuttle jun ma et al have investigated the hso3 pds system for the degradation of bisphenol a where the chain reactions were triggered via direct electron transfer qi et al 2017 in default of stable channel for shuttling electron from hso3 to pds both hso3 o2 system and pds oxidation system were initiated at a negligible rate k1 0 004 min 1 fig 3 a with the addition of trace iron 1 mg l the phenol degradation was significantly improved and the increasing performance on the phenol degradation and pds hso3 consumption fig si 2 text si 2 with an elevating concentration of iron suggested the essential role of iron catalyst for enhancing the electron transfer in the process similar enhancement occurred to co3 co2 addition into the hso3 pds system with k1 improvement of phenol degradation from 0 004 min 1 w o metal in the system to 0 314 min 1 fig 3b while another two single electron initiators cr3 cr2 and cu2 cu exhibited negligible influence on the oxidation process fig si 3 thermodynamically only when the redox potential of electron carrier was higher than that of one reactant and lower than that of the other could the electron shuttle continuously mediate the electron from the electron donor to electron acceptor van der zee and cervantes 2009 so the co3 co2 couple eɵ 1 82 v and fe3 fe2 pair eɵ 0 77 v could shuttle the single electron from hso3 eɵ so3 hso3 0 63 v to pds eɵ pds so4 2 01 v by forming continuous redox cycle and the redox potentials of cr3 cr2 eɵ 0 42 v and cu2 cu eɵ 0 16 v have obviously been outside the redox window 0 63 2 01 v bratsch 1989 huie and neta 1984 williams 1996 inspired by the electron shuttle in vivo which enabled the charge transport cross the bio membrane we further explained the spatial separation property of electron donating process and electron accepting process by dft analysis ma et al 2015 in the analysis a hyphen stood for the states where two units bonded with each other whereas the space presented the separate state as shown in fig 3c hso3 firstly adducted with s2o8 2 then it was transformed into transition state ts1 with gibbs free energy change g of 0 795 ev the positive value indicated a demand on energy input for ensuring the occurrence of elementary reaction later a hso4 so3 so4 adduct was formed from ts1 followed by in situ yield of hso4 so3 and so4 ga 0 232 ev where single electron transfer occurred in this step however if the decomposition was induced by two electron transfer hso4 so4 2 and so3 were produced with a negative gb 11 24 ev in the process indicating that the two electron transfer reaction could proceed spontaneously above analysis indicated that the direct reaction of hso3 with s2o8 2 could readily consume the redox capacity of each other instead of the formation of radicals finally the step where ts was formed was confirmed as the determining step through the reaction channel due to its highest positive g among these elementary reactions gds1 zhou et al 2019 only when the system overcame the uphill energy barrier activation energy did the reaction proceed fluently more specifically the determining step became the neck of the funnel for kinetics of so3 so4 production determining the kinetic constant for the whole process according to the arrhenius equation wei et al 2012 in the presence of iron fe3 fe2 redox pair could abstract electron from hso3 and donate electron to s2o8 2 in turn fig 3d accompanied by ex situ production of so4 radical and h so3 hso3 radical through the whole process the determining step in fig 3d was confirmed as the transformation stage of fe2 s2o8 2 to transition state 2 with an increasing gibbs free energy gds2 0 576 ev suggesting higher kinetic constant for producing desired so3 so4 radical in presence of iron comparing the dft results in two systems demonstrated that the employment of the fe3 fe2 cycle as electron shuttle not only paves a steady approach for single electron transfer between hso3 and pds due to the proper redox potential but also spatially separates the electron donation process and electron acception process while avoiding the mutual annihilation of hso3 and s2o8 2 via two electron transfer mechanism fig 3e 3 3 tuning the electron transfer inside chain reactions for maximizing so4 generation the chain reactions can be readily oriented to different radical configurations by tuning the composition parameters in the oxidation system li et al 2020 luo et al 2021a for instance fe3 h2o2 mainly forms oh using hydroxylamine or mos2 as electron donor for accelerating fe iii fe ii cycle chen et al 2011 xing et al 2018a whereas it yields singlet oxygen 1o2 employing metallic molybdenum as co catalyst yi et al 2019 analyzing the electron flow in the chain reactions facilitates subsequent manipulations on the operational mode herein various peroxide compounds were firstly explored for coupling the hso3 fe iii system unfortunately the performance on the hso3 fe iii system with addition of h2o2 or peroxymonosulfate pms oxygenated conditions was far inferior to that in our system fig si 4 which was aroused from the fast scavenging of h2o2 pms by hso3 via two electron route table 1 reaction 2 3 brandt and vaneldik 1995 kunen et al 1983 vincent et al 1998 the deviation of electron relay from the single electron transfer via electron shuttle fe3 fe2 cycle impeded the generation of ros due that the reagents have been consumed in contrast experimental data demonstrated pds to be relatively inert toward hso3 in the absence of electron shuttle reaction 1 the kinetic constant of hso3 with pds was also estimated as only 0 271 m 1s 1 by density function theory analysis text si 3 which was several magnitudes lower than those with h2o2 pms microscopically the generation of fe2 from fe3 should follow the complexation of fe3 reductant e g feso3 at the level of elementary reaction and the decomplexation of the transition state accompanied by the fe2 release has been revealed to positively affect the subsequent pds activation hso3 fe3 pds route li et al 2020 it has been well documented that fe3 could form various adducts with hso3 as solution ph varies including feso3 feso3h2 fe oh so3 and feso3h oh brandt and vaneldik 1995 the distribution of various fe3 hso3 adducts in the buffered solutions were simulated and analyzed by a chemical speciation model visual minteq software version 3 1 by varying the solution ph according to the results table si 1 only feso3 and fe oh so3 appeared under the conditions meanwhile the fe oh so3 concentration increased with an elevation of solution ph from 2 0 to 7 0 fig 4 b whereas the concentration of feso3 presented a declining trend correspondently a decrease of the operational ph from 7 0 to 2 0 induced an increasing k1 of phenol degradation from 0 min 1 to 0 059 min 1 fig 4b indicating that feso3 adduct exhibited faster decomplexation rate than fe oh so3 as well as efficient generation of reactive fe2 brandt and vaneldik 1995 the consistency between degradation kinetics of phenol anaerobic condition and feso3 concentration as functions of solution ph further proved the fe2 formation from the decomplexation of fe3 hso3 adducts to be the pivotal part in hso3 fe3 pds route furthermore the aerobic conditions could enhance the pivotal step and accelerate the generation of radicals guo et al 2013 afterwards the resultant so3 exhibited several possibilities to form desired precursor of ros so5 reaction 7 fe2 reaction 12 activate the pds reaction 11 text si 3 2 or induce a self quenching by other radicals reaction 13 14 for better understanding the proportion of different reaction routes concentrations of so3 so4 and so5 were estimated by kinetics simulation text si 4 then the reaction rate could be expressed as following reaction 7 r s o 3 k s o 3 o 2 4 2 1 0 5 s 1 s o 3 reaction 13 r s o 3 k s o 3 s o 3 0 123 s 1 s o 3 reaction 14 r s o 3 k s o 3 s o 4 1 61 1 0 14 s 1 s o 3 it is obviously that the rate of so3 with o2 was several orders of magnitude higher than those with other radicals so3 and so4 indicating the side reactions were self inhibited due to their low concentration in the system analogue analysis text si 2 was implemented and revealed that the destiny of so5 was mainly steered toward reaction with hso3 as well as formation of so4 reaction 8 as shown in fig 4c although the chain reactions showed high complexity on various mutual reactions in table 1 the system could be readily steered toward maximizing so4 production just by tuning the operation parameters such as the choice of peroxide compounds adjustment of ph levels and external addition of reactants 3 4 hso3 pds system for eliminating microbial risks of drinking water distribution systems using in situ generated electron shuttle for evaluating the application potential the hso3 fe3 s2o8 2 system was applied to urgently eliminate microbial risks of the drinking water distribution systems dwdss which actually harbored an astonishing number of pathogenic bacteria causing a large number of outbreaks and elevated clinical cases in the actual pipe network the mature biofilm did act many roles including boosting bacterial aggregations sustaining the stability of microbial aggregates providing nutrients for metabolism and endangering tap water security hence the use of chlorine disinfection was ineffective and problematic for the inactivation and inhibition of pathogenic bacteria liu et al 2016 wang et al 2013b wang et al 2012 xing et al 2018b zhang et al 2021 compared to fecal source pathogens opportunistic pathogens ops can multiply in the biofilm attached to the pipe material even in the presence of high chlorine residuals due to a large number of characteristics such as growth in amoebae growth at low organic carbon concentrations extracellular polymeric substance production etc wang et al 2013b xing et al 2018c for example acanthamoeba polyphaga cysts were able to protect legionella from at least 50 mg l free chlorine which was much higher than residual chlorine concentration at the end of pipe network around 0 05 mg l kilvington and price 1990 therefore chlorine disinfection wound not work for the microbial contamination emergency in the pipeline from a certain block for better simulating conditions of actual dwdss the annular reactors were loaded with 20 cast iron coupons and covered with tin foil to avoid light in the experiment the raw water samples flew into the simulated dwdss with up flow mode and the retention time was around 2 weeks simulating hydraulic condition in the actual pipeline with microbial risk generally atp was an important indicator to be considered as a measure of the activity or energy status of microbes with addition of hso3 and pds into system oxygenated atmosphere the atp concentration of bulk water in dwdss decreased sharply from 0 998 nmol l to 0 533 nmol l at 10 min finally stabilized at 0 170 nmol l fig 5 b fig si 7 indicating effective inhibition of microbial activity the typical ops in the process were further monitored by qpcr due to their emerging threat to public health wang et al 2013a at 0 min the gene copy numbers of legionella spp mycobacterium spp legionella pneumophila mycobacterium spp mycobacterium avium naegleria spp naegleria fowleri pseudomonas aeruginosa hartmanella vermiformis and acanthamoeba spp in the bulk water of dwdss were 3 72 106 9 55 103 7 59 106 6 03 103 1 12 106 3 72 103 6 17 105 1 95 105 and 1 45 107 gene copies ml fig 5c respectively after dosing na2so3 and pds the abundances of these ops dramatically decreased by 4 5 orders of magnitude in only 10 min and they were completely inactivated at 30 h by contrast the system showed negligible influence on these two indicators with dosing individual hso3 or pds fig 5b fig si 8 and fig si 9 the admirable performance could be ascribed to the ultrafast radical production in the hso3 fe3 pds system this was verified by the quenching experiments using 10 mm l histidine which has been proven to be an efficient scavenger for oh and so4 and harmless to microorganism with the inhibitory effect of l histidine on the radical atp decreased and the sterilization of monitored ops by radical was inhibited meanwhile fig si 10 eem results indicated that soluble microbial products peak a and protein peak b were significantly removed as reaction time increased fig 5f interestingly the slight increase of protein at 30 h was probably attributed to the cleavage of biofilms on the other hand humic acid like peak c and peak d and fulvic acid like substances peak e declined greatly in the process of reaction indicating that ubiquitous natural organic matter nom did not have adverse effects on environmental remediation and nom derived disinfections by productions could also be effectively inhibited yang et al 2021 the above results verified that pds completely eliminated the risk of pathogenic bacteria and the potential of microbial regrowth in dwdss using pre existing iron particles interestingly even without iron addition the hso3 pds system still exhibited admirable performance on destroying the biofilm inside the cast iron reactor which was controversy to our conclusion that the ultrafast output of radicals in the hso3 pds system was induced by the single electron shuttling mediated by iron cycle by icp oes analysis the iron concentration in the effluent was determined as 1 93 mg l which may root from the iron cast particles the cast iron particles in the reactor were collected before and after the treatment and the samples were analyzed by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps fig 5d the fe 2p spectrum of samples exhibited two major peaks centered at 711 6 and 724 9 ev which represented fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 respectively the peaks at 710 2 and 723 1 ev ascribed to fe2 whereas the peaks that correspond to 711 6 713 8 724 9 and 727 6 ev were assigned to fe3 wang et al 2021 it was obvious that both the intensity of both fe2 and fe3 weakened after reaction according to the element analysis the fe element relative ratio on the surface of cast iron particles decreased from 18 13 to 13 11 fig 5e indicating iron element shifted from the particle surface iron oxide to the bulk solution dissolved iron the dissolved iron from cast iron particles played a pivotal role of electron shuttle in the hso3 pds system therefore the disinfection was highly suppressed when the particles were removed at the beginning fig si 11 it should be mentioned that the wastewater should be emitted to the wastewater treatment plant the sulfate ions and trace iron in the system won t contaminate the drinking water by this way in the environmental remediation processes radical production via fenton or fenton like reactions has long suffered from the impractical requirement on stoichiometrically equivalent addition of sacrificial catalysts and their downstream treatment in this work the trace iron 2 0 mg l presented strong capacity to simultaneously activate two oxidation systems and continuously outputting a large number of free radicals owing to its capacity to shuttle single electron and spatially separate electro donating half reaction and electron accepting half reaction it is noticeable that 2 0 mg l iron in the effluent meets the municipal wastewater emission standard of several countries table si 2 indicating that the effluent can be directly emitted to the natural waters without necessity for post treatment of dissolved iron compared to the traditionally homogenous aops fenton fenton like processes the property could avoid the downstream treatment of the iron sludge and reduce the economic input furthermore as fourth most common element in the earth s crust iron element at the form of iron oxide is ubiquitous around the human footprint which readily enters the aqueous system and initiates the coupled oxidation processes at the form of dissolved iron this was verified by the application case of hso3 pds pair for inactivating the pathogens and inhibiting biofilm regrowth inside the distribution systems and might also applied to other environmental remediation processes unfortunately although the acidification of hso3 fe3 pds system as a pds based oxidation process could alleviate the negative effect of neutral alkaline condition zeng et al 2016 the new system can t still break the shackles of homogeneously iron based aops namely the narrow range of applicable solution ph sun et al 2018 it has been well documented that the addition of chelating agents e g edta could highly improve the solubility of iron ions at neutral alkaline condition and tune their existing species pan et al 2018 which may extend the applicable solution ph of new system and should be further investigated 4 conclusion in this study a coupled process was constructed using trace iron for simultaneously activating hso3 o2 system and peroxydisulfate pds oxidation system under the oxygenated condition the phenol degradation by hso3 fe3 pds system quickly occurred at a first order kinetic constant of k1 0 2225 min 1 which was almost 6 fold of that in the n2 atmosphere 0 0395 min 1 the improved performance on the degradation of model contaminant could be ascribed to the ultrafast generation of so4 and oh in the process where the iron ions 2 mg l transferred single electron from the former system to the latter due to the moderate redox potential fe3 fe2 0 77 v between the potentials of so3 hso3 0 63 v and pds so4 2 01 v density function theory reveals that the single electron shuttle spatially separates the electron donating activation of hso3 and electron accepting activation of pds while avoiding the mutual annihilation of hso3 and s2o8 2 via direct two electron transfer the system could be readily steered toward maximizing so4 production just by tuning the operation parameters such as the choice of peroxide compounds adjustment of ph levels and external addition of reactants finally utilizing the in situ generated electron shuttle dissolved iron from cast iron pipe the hso3 pds reagent could efficiently inactivate the chlorine

15578,the removal of arsenic as v and as iii from contaminated water has attracted great attention however the generation of arsenic containing hazardous waste by traditional methods has become an inevitable environmental problem herein a uv sulfite advanced reduction method was proposed to remove as v and as iii from aqueous solution in the form of valuable elemental arsenic as 0 thus avoiding the generation of arsenic containing hazardous waste the results showed that greater than 99 9 of as v and as iii were reduced to the high purity as 0 99 5 wt with the residual arsenic concentration below 10 μg l 1 the hydrated electrons eaq h and so3 radicals are generated by the uv sulfite process of which eaq and h serve as reductants of as v and as iii while the so3 radicals inhibit arsenic reduction by oxidizing arsenic the effective quantum efficiency φ for the formation of as 0 in the as v and as iii removal process is approximately 0 0078 and 0 0055 mol einstein respectively the reduction of arsenic is favorable under alkaline conditions ph 9 0 due to the higher photolysis efficiency of so3 2 than hso3 pka 7 2 and higher stability of eaq h under alkaline conditions the presence of dissolved oxygen o2 no2 no3 co3 2 po4 3 and humic acid ha inhibited arsenic reduction through light blocking or eaq h scavenging effects while cl so4 2 ca2 and mg2 had negligible effects on arsenic reduction the proposed method can effectively remove and recover arsenic from contaminated water at a low cost demonstrating feasibility for practical application this study provides a novel technology for the reductive removal and recovery of arsenic from contaminated water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords uv sulfite advanced reduction process elemental arsenic hydrated electron hydrogen radical 1 introduction arsenic is considered a group i carcinogen by the international agency for reserch on cancer iarc teixeira et al 2020 in natural water as v and as iii are the two inorganic arsenic species among which the toxicity and mobility of as iii are much higher than those of as v boussouga et al 2021 currently arsenic pollution is very serious in many countries chakraborti et al 2010 han et al 2019 shaji et al 2021 where high concentrations of arsenic in the environment poses a potential threat to ecosystem and human health gao et al 2022 li et al 2014a it is estimated that at least 200 million people worldwide are exposed to high levels of arsenic in groundwater and natural water bullen et al 2020 sarkar et al 2022 it is of great significance to develop effective technologies to control arsenic pollution the most common technologies for as v and as iii removal from contaminated water including adsorption coagulation flocculation ion exchange and membrane filtration have been proven to be effective in arsenic removal and have been widely used to purify the arsenic containing water chen et al 2020 choong et al 2007 pal and manna 2010 salmani et al 2021 however all of these treatment methods generate arsenic bearing wastes including solid wastes and liquid wastes choong et al 2007 clancy et al 2013 for instance adsorbents coagulants and ion exchange materials used in the arsenic removal process will be transformed into arsenic bearing solid wastes such as arsenic containing laterite activated alumina activated carbon iron based adsorbents nanocomposites aluminum salts iron salts and waste media materials cañas kurz et al 2021 chen et al 2015 choong et al 2007 ozola et al 2019 yadav et al 2019 the arsenic content in these arsenic bearing solid wastes reached up to 7500 mg kg 1 clancy et al 2013 resulting in an extremely high leaching concentration and thus the wastes were classified as hazardous wastes sullivan et al 2010 meanwhile arsenic bearing liquid wastes which can be generated in the process of membrane filtration as well as the process of regeneration of arsenic removal materials using alkali by backwashing and leaching etc are also a kind of hazardous waste choong et al 2007 currently the treatment of arsenic bearing hazardous wastes remains difficult landfilling after stabilization or solidification is the most common disposal pathway and is the best treatment method to limit arsenic release from wastes clancy et al 2013 however many arsenic bearing wastes are disposed directly into municipal waste landfills where arsenic can be released into landfill leachate and gases under reducing conditions clancy et al 2013 in particular arsenic bearing hazardous wastes are often directly discharged into the environment through sanitary sewers evaporation ponds lagoons or deep wells in developing countries resulting in a great risk of secondary pollution zhou et al 2020 recovering as v and as iii from arsenic containing wastewater in the form of valuable arsenic products to prevent the generation of arsenic bearing wastes is a promising strategy for arsenic treatment it is known that as 0 is a highly valuable approximately 6200 per ton and commercially available metalloid that can be used as an alloy additive to manufacture cemented carbide a raw material for preparing compound semiconductors and a doped element of semiconductor materials of germanium and silicon mikoushkin et al 2020 thus reducing as v and as iii to as 0 can not only efficiently remove arsenic from wastewater but also recover arsenic in the form of high value as 0 products several studies have shown the feasibility of reducing as v and as iii to as 0 by the ultraviolet uv tio2 methanol levy et al 2012 the cu 0 iodide wang et al 2019a the cu 0 chloride wang et al 2020 and the uv dithionite jung et al 2018 processes however the obtained products e g as 0 tio2 as 0 cu 0 as 0 as2s3 and as 0 as4s4 mixtures have low as 0 content and can also be regarded as hazardous wastes in addition our recent work showed that as v and as iii can be reductively removed from strongly acidic wastewater ph 2 in the form of high purity as 0 by a uv formic acid process however the reduction cannot occur at ph 4 under such a system kong et al 2022 therefore it is necessary to develop effective arsenic reduction and recovery methods that are suitable for the treatment of arsenic containing wastewater such as groundwater industrial wastewater and other natural water sodium sulfite na2so3 is a photosensitive substance that can be photolyzed into active species e g hydrated electrons eaq h and so3 radicals under uv irradiation of which h and eaq are strongly reductive cao et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 recently the uv sulfite process has been performed to degrade or remove pollutants such as oxyanions clo4 vellanki and batchelor 2013 metals cr vi xie et al 2017 halogenated byproducts e g monochloroacetic acid mcaa li et al 2012 1 2 dichloroethane liu et al 2014 vinyl chloride liu et al 2013 and polyfluoroalkyl substances gu et al 2016 thermodynamically the active species eaq e0 2 9 v buxton et al 1988 and h e0 h h 2 42 v parker 1992 can theoretically reduce as v e0 as v as iii 0 56 v bard et al 1985 wilson et al 2010 and as iii e0 as iii as 0 0 24 v bard et al 1985 wang et al 2020 thus we deduce that as v and as iii can be reductively removed and recovered in the form of high purity as 0 by the uv sulfite process however the removal and recovery efficiency of as v and as iii by the uv sulfite process as well as the influencing factors have not been studied and the reaction mechanism remains unclear and has not been systematically explored in this study the removal rate and efficiency of as v and as iii achieved by the uv sulfite process were investigated the free radicals and products formed in this process were identified and their roles in the reduction of arsenic were studied the effects of influencing factors e g sulfite and arsenic concentrations dissolved o2 ph and common coexisting substances on the reduction of as v and as iii were investigated and the removal mechanism of as v and as iii was comprehensively uncovered this study provides an alternative method for the reductive removal of arsenic from aqueous solution 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and materials all reagents used are described in text s1 in the supplementary materials deionized water was used in all experiments simulated arsenic containing water containing as v or as iii was prepared by adding naaso2 or na3aso4 12h2o to deionized water the arsenic containing water was purged with nitrogen gas n2 for 30 min to remove dissolved oxygen o2 real wastewater was sampled from arsenic polluted groundwater in hunan china and its main chemical compositions are shown in table s1 2 2 experimental apparatus and procedure batch experiments were conducted in a photochemical reactor equipped with a 32 w uv low pressure mercury lamp 300 15 mm foshan comwin light electricity co ltd china which mainly emits a wavelength of 253 7 nm the reactor was detailedly described in our previous study kong et al 2022 the photochemical reactor is a quartz glass cylindrical reactor with an inner diameter of 40 mm and a height of 310 mm the lamp was equipped with a quartz sleeve and placed vertically in the middle of the reactor the volume of the vessel is 300 ml and a magnetic stirrer was installed at the bottom of the reactor fig s1 the incident photon flux ii of the photochemical reactor at 253 7 nm was measured to be 9 65 10 6 einstein s 1 by the ki kio3 method the effective path length l of light was measured to be 1 79 cm according to the photolysis kinetics of 0 5 mm h2o2 the gas discharged from the top was connected to the gas chromatograph gc or ash3 gas absorption bottle containing sodium hypobromate solution the reactor was immersed in a plexiglass container filled with circulating cooling water to maintain the temperature of the reactor at 25 1 c unless otherwise stated all the experiments were carried out under anaerobic conditions the as v and as iii removal kinetics experiments were conducted employing 10 mg l 1 as v or as iii and various concentrations of sulfite 0 4 13 33 mm to investigate the effect of ph experiments were conducted at ph values of 5 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 10 0 11 0 and 14 0 which were adjusted using h2so4 and naoh the effects of eaq and h radicals on arsenic reduction were investigated by adding no2 and no3 in addition the effects of the initial arsenic concentration 10 100 mg l 1 o2 ha 30 mg l 1 and coexisting ions i e ca2 30 mg l 1 mg2 30 mg l 1 co3 2 10 mm po4 3 10

through a 0 45 μm polyvinylidene fluoride membrane filter for arsenic sulfate sulfite and dithionate analysis the formed gas was blown out by argon to analyze the gas composition the formed precipitates were separated from the suspension by filtration centrifuged and dried washed several times with anaerobic water freeze dried and stored in a brown bottle filled with nitrogen n2 to avoid oxidation all the experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 3 analytical methods detailed analysis methods are provided in text s2 the molar extinction coefficients of sulfite fig s2 as v fig s3 as

aqueous solution by uv sulfite process the removal efficiency of 10 mg l 1 as v or as iii by various concentrations of sulfite at ph 9 0 in the dark and under uv irradiation in an anaerobic solution was investigated as v and as iii could not be removed by sulfite in the dark fig s5a in addition the concentrations of as v and as iii remained unchanged under uv irradiation in the absence of sulfite under anaerobic conditions fig s5b however as shown in fig 1 the concentrations of as v and as iii decreased in the uv sulfite system and more than 99 9 of as v and as iii were removed within 80 min under uv irradiation when the sulfite concentration was higher than 13 3 mm fig 1a and b linear relationships with good correlation coefficients between the removal rate of arsenic r and sulfite concentration were observed fig 1c and d these results indicated that the removal of as v or as iii was initiated by the combination of uv and sulfite as v transformed into as iii and subsequently vanished during the removal of as v in addition a portion of as v formed and subsequently attenuated during the removal of as iii fig 1e and f these results indicated that the removal of as v and as iii by the uv sulfite process may involve redox reactions moreover more than 99 9 of as v and as iii with different initial concentrations 10 100 mg l 1 were removed from the solution at a sulfite arsenic molar ratio of 100 fig 2 the residual arsenic concentration was as low as 8 μg l 1 which can meet the requirements of the arsenic drinking water guideline 10 μg l 1 stipulated by the who who 2017 brown black precipitates formed during the removal of as v and as iii by the uv sulfite process the results of sem eds analysis indicated that as and o were the main elements in the precipitates in which as accounted for 99 84 wt and 99 76 wt of precipitates obtained from as v and as iii removal respectively fig 3 a and b in addition as shown in fig 3c and d two peaks located at 45 0 ev and 41 7 ev which were in accordance with the peaks of as iii within as2o3 and as 0 wang et al 2019b zhou et al 2004 were detected by xps analysis the proportions of as 0 in the precipitates for as v and as iii removal were calculated to be 99 69 wt and 99 58 wt respectively table s3 moreover the xrd spectra of precipitates fig 3e and f were consistent with the reported spectra of amorphous as 0 yang et al 2019 the above results verified that as 0 was the main component in the precipitates the existence of a small amount of as2o3 in the precipitates was attributed to the partial oxidation of as 0 by o2 during the preparation and storage of the samples the content of as 0 in the precipitates reached the purity requirement of commercial as 0 products 99 5 wt indicating that the obtained as 0 can be recovered thus as v and as iii can be reductively removed and recovered from aqueous solution in the form of valuable as 0 by the uv sulfite process 3 2 effects of reactive species and products on the removal of as v and as iii the reactive species intermediate species and products formed in the uv sulfite system were identified esr spectra obtained from the dmpo trapping experiments showed that no signal was detected in the dark while obvious signals were observed under uv irradiation fig 4 which can be ascribed to two dmpo adducts the first adduct which has six signal peaks with parameters of αn 14 7 g αβ h 16 1 g corresponds to the reported dmpo so3 signal αn 14 7 g αβ h 16 0 g shi and dalal 1990 zamora and villamena 2012 indicating the formation of so3 the second adduct which has five signal peaks with parameters of αn 16 6 g αβ h 22 4 g corresponds to the reported dmpo h signal αn 16 7 g αβ h 22 4 g perissinotti et al 2001 qin et al 2021 confirming the formation of h radicals it has been reported that reactive species i e eaq h and so3 radicals can form by the photolysis of so3 2 and hso3 eqs 1 and 2 li et al 2012 so3 2 dominates at ph 9 0 since sulfite has a pka of 7 2 and eaq initially forms under such a condition li et al 2012 the detection of h radicals is due to the rapid conversion between eaq and h eqs 3 5 buxton et al 1988 therefore eaq h and so3 form under such conditions in addition s2o6 2 and so4 2 which can be generated by the reaction of two so3 eqs 6 and 7 diester and warneck 1990 gu et al 2016 formed along with the decomposition of sulfite during the removal of arsenic fig s6 sulfur mass balance analysis showed that s2o6 2 and so4 2 were the only two sulfur containing products table s4 1 so 3 2 hv so 3 e aq 2 hso 3 hv so 3 h 3 e

experiments were conducted to investigate the roles of eaq and h in the removal of arsenic when an excellent eaq and h scavenger i e no2 10 mm eqs 8 and 9 buxton et al 1988 zhang et al 2022 was added to the arsenic uv sulfite system complete inhibition of as v and as iii removal was observed fig 5 a and b indicating that eaq and or h is responsible for the removal of arsenic in addition it has been reported that no3 can only efficiently react with eaq but not h radicals eqs 10 and 11 buxton et al 1988 zhang et al 2022 as shown in fig 5c and d the addition of 10 mm no3 reduced the arsenic removal rates of as v and as iii from 3 16 10 5 mm s 1 and 3 69 10 5 mm s 1 to 2 92 10 6 mm s 1 and 6 09 10 6 mm s 1 respectively it was calculated that eaq and h radicals accounted for 90 8 and 9 2 of as v removal and 83 5 and 16 5 of as iii removal respectively thus eaq plays a major role while h plays a minor role in the reduction of arsenic at ph 9 0 although the proportion of h is higher than that of eaq at ph 9 0 because the pka of h is 9 7 diester and warneck 1990 the key role of eaq in arsenic reduction may be due to its lower reduction potential 2 9 v than that of h 2 42 v which can reduce arsenic more efficiently 8 no 2 e aq no 2 2 k 4 1 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 9 no 2 h n o o h k 7 1 1 0 8 m 1 s 1 10 no 3 e aq no 3 2 k 9 7 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 11 no 3 h n o 3 h k 1 4 1 0 6 m 1 s 1 the effect of so3 s2o6 2 and so4 2 on the removal of arsenic was investigated as shown in fig 1f as v formed and gradually disappeared during as iii removal indicating that as iii was initially oxidized to as v in the uv sulfite system it is noted that although as iii can be oxidized to as v in the presence of o2 under uv irradiation without requiring any other chemical reagent it cannot be oxidized without o2 fig s7 ryu et al 2013 as shown in fig 5b the oxidation of as iii during as iii removal was greatly promoted when the reductive eaq and h radicals were quenched by no2 indicating that the oxidation should be caused by so3 s2o6 2 and so4 2 which are the only three species under such conditions it is known that so4 2 cannot oxidize as iii in addition the oxidation of as iii was negligible in the presence of s2o6 2 under dark anoxic conditions at ph 9 0 fig s8 which is consistent with the report xu et al 2016 because the standard reduction potential of s2o6 2 so3 2 couple 0 57 v bard et al 1985 is similar to that of as v as iii couple 0 56 v the oxidation of as iii should be attributed to the so3 radicals because the standard reduction potential of so3 so3 2 couple 0 63 v cao et al 2021 is higher than that of as v as iii couple 0 56 v the oxidation can thermodynamically occur which has been confirmed experimentally by a previous study zhang et al 2021 in addition s2o6 2 and so3 can oxidize as 0 to as iii because the standard reduction potentials of s2o6 2 so3 2 couple 0 57 v and so3 so3 2 couple 0 63 v are much higher than that of as iii as 0 couple 0 24 v although the oxidation and reduction processes coexist in the uv sulfite process the oxidation process was less important which may be due to that most of so3 radicals rapidly transformed into so4 2 eqs 6 and 7 3 3 effect of ph as shown in fig 6 a and b the removal rates of as v and as iii changed significantly at different ph values the removal rates of as v and as iii increased with the increase of solution ph from 5 0 to 9 0 the pka of sulfite is 7 2 thus hso3 dominates in the ph range from 4 0 to 6 0 and so3 2 dominates at ph values above 9 0 fig s9 from ph 5 0 to 9 0 the variation tendency of the arsenic removal rate seems to be consistent with that of the so3 2 distribution that is the arsenic removal rate increased with the increase of so3 2 proportion which may be due to the higher molar absorption coefficient of so3 2 18 01 m 1 cm 1 than those of hso3 0 18 m 1 cm 1 at 253 7 nm table s2 however the poor linear relationship between the arsenic removal rate and so3 2 proportion was observed from ph 5 0 to 9 0 fig 6c and d indicating that the variation tendency of the arsenic removal rate cannot be fully explained by the so3 2 proportion for instance according to the so3 2 distribution the removal rate of arsenic at ph 7 0 was expected to reach approximately 50 of that at ph 9 0 however the actual removal rate of arsenic at ph 7 0 was only 5 that of the rate at ph 9 0 the lower removal rate of arsenic at circumneutral ph may be due to the rapid eaq quenching effect of hso3 eq 12 yu et al 2018 leading to a decrease in the eaq concentration and thereby greatly inhibiting the removal rate of arsenic in addition the removal rates of as v and as iii remained unchanged with the further increases in solution ph from 9 0 to 11 0 since so3 2 dominates under such conditions 12 e aq hso 3 h so 3 2 k 2 1 0 7 m 1 s 1 moreover the removal rate of arsenic significantly decreased at ph 14 0 the variation in removal rate was not due to the speciation distribution of sulfite since so3 2 is the dominant species under such conditions this may be caused by the change in the speciation distribution of as v and as iii fig s10 because the different as v and as iii species can react with eaq with different rate constants for instance the reaction rate between h2aso4 and eaq 2 109 m 1 s 1 was 10 fold the reaction rate between haso4 2 and eaq 2 108 m 1 s 1 klaening et al 1989 therefore solution ph greatly affects the speciation distribution of sulfite as v and as iii and influences the interactions between sulfite and reactive species thereby affecting the removal efficiencies of as v and as iii 3 4 effect of dissolved o2 it has been reported that dissolved o2 greatly influences the removal and degradation of pollutants by the uv sulfite process cao et al 2021 li et al 2014b as shown in fig 7 the removal rates of as v and as iii by the uv sulfite process were inhibited in the presence of the dissolved o2 which decreased from 3 16 10 5 mm s 1 and 3 69 10 5 mm s 1 to 2 83 10 5 mm s 1 and 3 14 10 5 mm s 1 for as v and as iii removal respectively the dissolved o2 can not only efficiently scavenge eaq and h to form o2 radicals eqs 13 and 14 buxton et al 1988 but can also rapidly transform so3 into strongly oxidative so4 and so5 radicals eqs 15 18 cao et al 2021 luo et al 2019 in addition the dissolved o2 can also directly oxidize sulfite under alkaline conditions eq 19 norton et al 1968 in which the intermediate species i e so3 so4 so5 and o2 can also be generated eqs 15 19 li et al 2014b neta et al 1988 the inhibition effect was not only due to the oxidation of different arsenic species e g as 0 as iii and the intermediate arsenic species e g as iv by the so3 so4 so5 o2 radicals and o2 but was also ascribed to the decrease in sulfite concentration in solution caused by the oxidation of o2 which can lead to a further decrease in eaq and h the inhibitory effect of o2 on the removal of arsenic was limited at high sulfite concentrations in our study 13 3 mm fig 7 which is due to the low saturating concentration of o2 0 28 mm however it was found that the inhibition effect was promoted at a low sulfite concentration fig s11 for instance when treating wastewater with different arsenic concentrations at the same sulfite arsenic ratio the removal rate of arsenic is reduced by approximately 41 2 at a sulfite concentration of 1 33 mm and by 95 9 at a sulfite concentration of 0 665 mm thus wastewater should be deoxygenated in advance or the sulfite arsenic ratio should be increased especially when treating wastewater with low arsenic concentrations 13 e aq o 2 o 2 k 1 9 1 0 10 m 1 s 1 14 h o 2 o 2 h k 2 1 1 0 10 m 1 s 1 15 so 3 o 2 so 5 k 1 2 2 5 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 16 so 5 hso 3 hso 4 so 4 k 2 5 1 0 4 m 1 s 1 17 so 5 so 3 2 so 4 2 so 4

ha on the removal of as v and as iii were investigated fig 8 the presence of 10 mm co3 2 and po4 3 suppressed the removal of as v and as iii while 10 mm cl did not affect the removal of arsenic the inhibition effects of co3 2 and po4 3 were not due to the light blocking effect because of their low molar absorption coefficients at 253 7 nm 0 1 m 1 cm 1 table s2 it was reported that the rate constants of eaq reaction with co3 2 and po4 3 are 3 9 105 m 1 s 1 and 2 105 m 1 s 1 respectively ren et al 2021 in addition eaq is difficult to react with cl because it is in the lowest valance state the rate constants were consistent with the inhibition order co3 2 po4 3 cl suggesting that the scavenging of eaq h by these anions should be the most likely reason for the inhibition moreover it was found that 30 mg l 1 ca2 and mg2 have little effect on the removal of arsenic because of their low molar absorption coefficients and inert reaction with eaq h the removal rate constants of as v and as iii decreased from 3 16 10 5 mm s 1 and 3 69 10 5 mm s 1 in the absence of ha to 6 65 10 6 mm s 1 and 9 57 10 6 mm s 1 in the presence of 30 mg l 1 ha respectively the significant inhibition could be attributed to uv blocking and the eaq h scavenging effect it was found that 30 mg l 1 ha can greatly absorb uv light with an absorbance of 0 879 at 253 7 nm fig s12 absorbing 97 3 calculated by 1 10 εcl of uv light thus ha can strongly compete with sulfite for photons leading to a decrease in eaq h production cui et al 2020 uyguner and bekbolet 2005 in addition the chemical groups such as f cl br no2 cooh and cho in ha and its uv induced degradation products can rapidly react with eaq h cui et al 2020 li et al 2019 ha can compete with as v and as iii for eaq h thus inhibiting arsenic removal ren et al 2021 therefore a high concentration of ha as well as other organic compounds with similar functional groups should be removed before treatment 3 6 quantum yield of the uv sulfite process the quantum yield of eaq h formation ф1 at 253 7 nm at ph 9 0 is defined as the moles of the formed eaq h divided by the moles of photons absorbed by sulfite which can be calculated by the following equation eq 20 li et al 2012 20 φ 1 r 1 v i i 1 10 ε c l where r1 is the decomposition rate of sulfite i e the formation rate of eaq h v is the volume of the photoreactor 0 3 l ii is the incident photon flux 9 65 10 6 einstein s 1 ε is the molar extinction coefficient of sulfite 18 01 m 1 cm 1 at 253 7 nm at ph 9 0 table s2 c is the concentration of sulfite 0 0133 m and l is the reactor path length 1 79 cm as shown in fig s6 the decomposition rate of sulfite r1 in the removal of as v and as iii is 3 83 10 4 mm s 1 and 3 93 10 4 mm s 1 thus the quantum yields of eaq h formation ф1 at 253 7 nm in the removal of as v and as iii were calculated to be 0 0190 and 0 0195 mol einstein respectively in addition the quantum yield of as 0 formation ф2 which was defined as the moles of as 0 formed divided by the total photons absorbed by sulfite was calculated by replacing r1 with the formation rate of as 0 i e the removal rate of arsenic r2 the ф2 values for the removal of as v and as iii were calculated to be 0 00156 and 0 00183 mol einstein respectively assuming that all eaq h were captured by as v and as iii the effective quantum yield of eaq h formation ф3 can be calculated from ф2 by multiplying the number of electron transfers from as v as iii to as 0 thus the ф3 values in the removal of as v and as iii were calculated to be 0 0078 0 00156 5 and 0 0055 0 00183 3 mol einstein respectively which were lower than ф1 the lower ф3 suggested that the formed eaq h may not be fully involved in the reduction of as v and as iii or consumed by other processes the most likely reason for the lower ф3 was the oxidation of as 0 and as iii by so3 radicals which indirectly consumed eaq h in the uv sulfite system 3 7 removal mechanisms of as v and as iii by uv sulfite process the mechanism of the removal of as v and as iii from aqueous solution by the uv sulfite process was proposed as follows fig 9 the sulfite photolyzes into eaq h and so3 in which eaq h are responsible for the reduction of as v as iii assuming one electron consecutive steps as iv initially forms via the reduction of as v by eaq h eq 21 klaening et al 1989 levy et al 2012 which may be further reduced to as iii by eaq h eq 22 then as iii reacts with eaq h into as ii and as i and finally into as 0 eqs 23 25 levy et al 2012 in addition arsenic can also be reduced by the disproportionation of the intermediate species i e as iv as ii and as i eqs 26 28 klaening et al 1989 levy et al 2012 so3 radicals can oxidize as 0 and as iii eqs 29 and 30 thereby inhibiting the reduction of as v and as iii however the reduction process dominates while the oxidation process is secondary because of the rapid transformation of so3 into so4 2 and s2o6 2 21 as v e aq h as iv k 2 1 0 8 2 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 22 as iv e aq h as iii 23 as iii e aq h as ii k 5 5 7 1 0 8 m 1 s 1 24 as ii e aq h as i 25 as i e aq h as 0 26 as iv as iv as iii as v k 4 5 1 0 8 2 0 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 27 as ii as ii as i as iii 28 as i as i as ii as 0 29 so 3 as iii as iv so 3 2 30 so 3 as 0 as i so 3 2 in addition the reduction of as 0 with eaq h to produce ash3 is thermodynamically feasible because the reduction potential of the eaq 2 9 v and h h couple 2 42 v are much lower than that of the as 0 as iii couple 0 23 v bard et al 1985 however the ash3 gas analysis and arsenic mass balance analysis fig s13 both showed that ash3 was not generated during the removal of as v and as iii by the uv sulfite process these results indicated that the reduction of as 0 by eaq h is kinetically difficult which may be due to the high activation energy barrier of the reaction 3 8 application potential the feasibility of the proposed method was assessed in practical arsenic containing groundwater treatment as shown in fig 10 0 3 mg l 1 as v and 1 2 mg l 1 as iii were removed from groundwater by 2 mm sulfite after 35 min of uv irradiation with a residual arsenic concentration of 7 μg l 1 the purity of the obtained as 0 was as high as 99 56 wt fig s14 in addition the removal of as v and as iii from practical wastewater was only slightly lower than that from simulated wastewater in the absence of coexisting ions and doc indicating that the main constituents in practical wastewater do not significantly interfere with the removal of arsenic these results showed that the proposed method has strong adaptability to wastewater with complex water quality conditions and can effectively treat arsenic containing water the electrical energy per order of arsenic removal ee o which is defined as the electrical energy in kilowatt hours kwh required to achieve the degradation of a pollutant by the order of magnitude 90 removal in 1 m3 wastewater can be calculated according to eq 31 cao et al 2021 tan et al 2021 31 ee o prt 1000 v log c i c t kwh m 3 orde r 1 where p is the lamp power output kw r is the efficiency for uv energy utilization t is the irradiation time h v is the reactor volume l ci is the initial concentration of arsenic mg l 1 ct is the final concentration of arsenic mg l 1 it was calculated that the efficiency for uv energy utilization r was approximately 15 7 in which 13 8 of uv light was absorbed by sulfite and 1 9 by other constituents 1 9 in the photochemical reactor during the reaction tables s1 and s2 figs s2 s4 thus the ee o value was calculated to be 8 37 kwh m 3 order 1 based on the results of practical wastewater experiments the cost of industrial electricity is approximately 0 08 per kwh in china so the electrical cost of uv irradiation is approximately 0 67 per cubic meter of wastewater the cost of sulfite na2so3 0 28 kg was estimated to be 0 07 0 252 kg 0 28 kg per cubic meter of wastewater in addition approximately 1 5 g as 0 6200 t was obtained from each cubic meter of wastewater generating earnings of approximately 0 01 therefore the total cost of the proposed method was approximately 0 73 per cubic meter of wastewater the cost can further decrease through further optimization of the operational and reaction parameters thus the proposed method offers good application potential in arsenic removal and recovery 4 conclusions in summary this study proposed an effective uv sulfite advanced reduction method to remove and recover as v and as iii from aqueous solution in the form of valuable as 0 products thus avoiding the generation of arsenic containing hazardous waste more than 99 9 of arsenic 10 100 mg l 1 was reduced to high purity as 0 99 5 wt and the residual arsenic concentration in the solution was below 10 μg l 1 which met the requirements of the arsenic drinking water guideline 10 μg l 1 stipulated by the who the increased sulfite concentration is proportionally correlated with the enhanced removal rates of arsenic the eaq h and so3 radicals form by the photolysis of sulfite under uv irradiation at 253 7 nm of which eaq and h can reduce as v and as iii to as 0 the relatively lower quantum efficiency φ for as 0 formation was ascribed to the oxidation of as 0 and as iii by so3 radicals which indirectly consumed eaq h in the system the removal rate of arsenic increased with the increasing ph from 5 0 to 9 0 and remained constant when the ph further increased because of the higher photolysis efficiency of so3 2 than hso3 and the higher stability of eaq h under alkaline conditions the dissolved o2 no2 no3 co3 2 po4 3 and ha inhibited the removal of arsenic through light blocking or eaq h scavenging effects while cl ca2 and mg2 had negligible effects on arsenic reduction moreover arsenic can be efficiently removed and recovered from contaminated groundwater in the form of highly valuable as 0 at a low cost demonstrating that the proposed method is promising for practical arsenic containing water treatment

15578,the removal of arsenic as v and as iii from contaminated water has attracted great attention however the generation of arsenic containing hazardous waste by traditional methods has become an inevitable environmental problem herein a uv sulfite advanced reduction method was proposed to remove as v and as iii from aqueous solution in the form of valuable elemental arsenic as 0 thus avoiding the generation of arsenic containing hazardous waste the results showed that greater than 99 9 of as v and as iii were reduced to the high purity as 0 99 5 wt with the residual arsenic concentration below 10 μg l 1 the hydrated electrons eaq h and so3 radicals are generated by the uv sulfite process of which eaq and h serve as reductants of as v and as iii while the so3 radicals inhibit arsenic reduction by oxidizing arsenic the effective quantum efficiency φ for the formation of as 0 in the as v and as iii removal process is approximately 0 0078 and 0 0055 mol einstein respectively the reduction of arsenic is favorable under alkaline conditions ph 9 0 due to the higher photolysis efficiency of so3 2 than hso3 pka 7 2 and higher stability of eaq h under alkaline conditions the presence of dissolved oxygen o2 no2 no3 co3 2 po4 3 and humic acid ha inhibited arsenic reduction through light blocking or eaq h scavenging effects while cl so4 2 ca2 and mg2 had negligible effects on arsenic reduction the proposed method can effectively remove and recover arsenic from contaminated water at a low cost demonstrating feasibility for practical application this study provides a

hydrated electron hydrogen radical 1 introduction arsenic is considered a group i carcinogen by the international agency for reserch on cancer iarc teixeira et al 2020 in natural water as v and as iii are the two inorganic arsenic species among which the toxicity and mobility of as iii are much higher than those of as v boussouga et al 2021 currently arsenic pollution is very serious in many countries chakraborti et al 2010 han et al 2019 shaji et al 2021 where high concentrations of arsenic in the environment poses a potential threat to ecosystem and human health gao et al 2022 li et al 2014a it is estimated that at least 200 million people worldwide are exposed to high levels of arsenic in groundwater and natural water bullen et al 2020 sarkar et al 2022 it is of great significance to develop effective technologies to control arsenic pollution the most common technologies for as v and as iii removal from contaminated water including adsorption coagulation flocculation ion exchange and membrane filtration have been proven to be effective in arsenic removal and have been widely used to purify the arsenic containing water chen et al 2020 choong et al 2007 pal and manna 2010 salmani et al 2021 however all of these treatment methods generate arsenic bearing wastes including solid wastes and liquid wastes choong et al 2007 clancy et al 2013 for instance adsorbents coagulants and ion exchange materials used in the arsenic removal process will be transformed into arsenic bearing solid wastes such as arsenic containing laterite activated alumina activated carbon iron based adsorbents nanocomposites aluminum salts iron salts and waste media materials cañas kurz et al 2021 chen et al 2015 choong et al 2007 ozola et al 2019 yadav et al 2019 the arsenic content in these arsenic bearing solid wastes reached up to 7500 mg kg 1 clancy et al 2013 resulting in an extremely high leaching concentration and thus the wastes were classified as hazardous wastes sullivan et al 2010 meanwhile arsenic bearing liquid wastes which can be generated in the process of membrane filtration as well as the process of regeneration of arsenic removal materials using alkali by backwashing and leaching etc are also a kind of hazardous waste choong et al 2007 currently the treatment of arsenic bearing hazardous wastes remains difficult landfilling after stabilization or solidification is the most common disposal pathway and is the best treatment method to limit arsenic release from wastes clancy et al 2013 however many arsenic bearing wastes are disposed directly into municipal waste landfills where arsenic can be released into landfill leachate and gases under reducing conditions clancy et al 2013 in particular arsenic bearing hazardous wastes are often directly discharged into the environment through sanitary sewers evaporation ponds lagoons or deep wells in developing countries resulting in a great risk of secondary pollution zhou et al 2020 recovering as v and as iii from arsenic containing wastewater in the form of valuable arsenic products to prevent the generation of arsenic bearing wastes is a promising strategy for arsenic treatment it is known that as 0 is a highly valuable approximately 6200 per ton and commercially available metalloid that can be used as an alloy additive to manufacture cemented carbide a raw material for preparing compound semiconductors and a doped element of semiconductor materials of germanium and silicon mikoushkin et al 2020 thus reducing as v and as iii to as 0 can not only efficiently remove arsenic from wastewater but also recover arsenic in the form of high value as 0 products several studies have shown the feasibility of reducing as v and as iii to as 0 by the ultraviolet uv tio2 methanol levy et al 2012 the cu 0 iodide wang et al 2019a the cu 0 chloride wang et al 2020 and the uv dithionite jung et al 2018 processes however the obtained products e g as 0 tio2 as 0 cu 0 as 0 as2s3 and as 0 as4s4 mixtures have low as 0 content and can also be regarded as hazardous wastes in addition our recent work showed that as v and as iii can be reductively removed from strongly acidic wastewater ph 2 in the form of high purity as 0 by a uv formic acid process however the reduction cannot occur at ph 4 under such a system kong et al 2022 therefore it is necessary to develop effective arsenic reduction and recovery methods that are suitable for the treatment of arsenic containing wastewater such as groundwater industrial wastewater and other natural water sodium sulfite na2so3 is a photosensitive substance that can be photolyzed into active species e g hydrated electrons eaq h and so3 radicals under uv irradiation of which h and eaq are strongly reductive cao et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 recently the uv sulfite process has been performed to degrade or remove pollutants such as oxyanions clo4 vellanki and batchelor 2013 metals cr vi xie et al 2017 halogenated byproducts e g monochloroacetic acid mcaa li et al 2012 1 2 dichloroethane liu et al 2014 vinyl chloride liu et al 2013 and polyfluoroalkyl substances gu et al 2016 thermodynamically the active species eaq e0 2 9 v buxton et al 1988 and h e0 h h 2 42 v parker 1992 can theoretically reduce as v e0 as v as iii 0 56 v bard et al 1985 wilson et al 2010 and as iii e0 as iii as 0 0 24 v bard et al 1985 wang et al 2020 thus we deduce that as v and as iii can be reductively removed and recovered in the form of high purity as 0 by the uv sulfite process however the removal and recovery efficiency of as v and as iii by the uv sulfite process as well as the influencing factors have not been studied and the reaction mechanism remains unclear and has not been systematically explored in this study the removal rate and efficiency of as v and as iii achieved by the uv sulfite process were investigated the free radicals and products formed in this process were identified and their roles in the reduction of arsenic were studied the effects of influencing factors e g sulfite and arsenic concentrations dissolved o2 ph and common coexisting substances on the reduction of as v and as iii were investigated and the removal mechanism of as v and as iii was comprehensively uncovered this study provides an alternative method for the reductive removal of arsenic from aqueous solution 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and materials all reagents used are described in text s1 in the supplementary materials deionized water was used in all experiments simulated arsenic containing water containing as v or as iii was prepared by adding naaso2 or na3aso4 12h2o to deionized water the arsenic containing water was purged with nitrogen gas n2 for 30 min to remove dissolved oxygen o2 real wastewater was sampled from arsenic polluted groundwater in hunan china and its main chemical compositions are shown in table s1 2 2 experimental apparatus and procedure batch experiments were conducted in a photochemical reactor equipped with a 32 w uv low pressure mercury lamp 300 15 mm foshan comwin light electricity co ltd china which mainly emits a wavelength of 253 7 nm the reactor was detailedly described in our previous study kong et al 2022 the photochemical reactor is a quartz glass cylindrical reactor with an inner diameter of 40 mm and a height of 310 mm the lamp was equipped with a quartz sleeve and placed vertically in the middle of the reactor the volume of the vessel is 300 ml and a magnetic stirrer was installed at the bottom of the reactor fig s1 the incident photon flux ii of the photochemical reactor at 253 7 nm was measured to be 9 65 10 6 einstein s 1 by the ki kio3 method the effective path length l of light was measured to be 1 79 cm according to the photolysis kinetics of 0 5 mm h2o2 the gas discharged from the top was connected to the gas chromatograph gc or ash3 gas absorption bottle containing sodium hypobromate solution the reactor was immersed in a plexiglass container filled with circulating cooling water to maintain the temperature of the reactor at 25 1 c unless otherwise stated all the experiments were carried out under anaerobic conditions the as v and as iii removal kinetics experiments were conducted employing 10 mg l 1 as v or as iii and various concentrations of sulfite 0 4 13 33 mm to investigate the effect of ph experiments were conducted at ph values of 5 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 10 0 11 0 and 14 0 which were adjusted using h2so4 and naoh the effects of eaq and h radicals on arsenic reduction were investigated by adding no2 and no3 in addition the effects of the initial arsenic concentration 10 100 mg l 1 o2 ha 30 mg l 1 and coexisting ions i e ca2 30 mg l 1 mg2 30 mg l 1 co3 2 10 mm po4 3 10 mm and cl 10 mm on the removal efficiency of as v and as iii were also studied at prescribed time intervals 2 ml aliquots of samples were withdrawn by a disposable syringe and immediately passed through a 0 45 μm polyvinylidene fluoride membrane filter for arsenic sulfate sulfite and dithionate analysis the formed gas was blown out by argon to analyze the gas composition the formed precipitates were separated from the suspension by filtration centrifuged and dried washed several times with anaerobic water freeze dried and stored in a brown bottle filled with nitrogen n2 to avoid oxidation all the experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 3 analytical methods detailed analysis methods are provided in text s2 the molar extinction coefficients of sulfite fig s2 as v fig s3 as iii fig s4 and impurities table s2 were determined by uv vis spectrometer dr6000 hach usa in the wavelength range of 200 400 nm 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal efficiency of as v and as iii from aqueous solution by uv sulfite process the removal efficiency of 10 mg l 1 as v or as iii by various concentrations of sulfite at ph 9 0 in the dark and under uv irradiation in an anaerobic solution was investigated as v and as iii could not be removed by sulfite in the dark fig s5a in addition the concentrations of as v and as iii remained unchanged under uv irradiation in the absence of sulfite under anaerobic conditions fig s5b however as shown in fig 1 the concentrations of as v and as iii decreased in the uv sulfite system and more than 99 9 of as v and as iii were removed within 80 min under uv irradiation when the sulfite concentration was higher than 13 3 mm fig 1a and b linear relationships with good correlation coefficients between the removal rate of arsenic r and sulfite concentration were observed fig 1c and d these results indicated that the removal of as v or as iii was initiated by the combination of uv and sulfite as v transformed into as iii and subsequently vanished during the removal of as v in addition a portion of as v formed and subsequently attenuated during the removal of as iii fig 1e and f these results indicated that the removal of as v and as iii by the uv sulfite process may involve redox reactions moreover more than 99 9 of as v and as iii with different initial concentrations 10 100 mg l 1 were removed from the solution at a sulfite arsenic molar ratio of 100 fig 2 the residual arsenic concentration was as low as 8 μg l 1 which can meet the requirements of the arsenic drinking water guideline 10 μg l 1 stipulated by the who who 2017 brown black precipitates formed during the removal of as v and as iii by the uv sulfite process the results of sem eds analysis indicated that as and o were the main elements in the precipitates in which as accounted for 99 84 wt and 99 76 wt of precipitates obtained from as v and as iii removal respectively fig 3 a and b in addition as shown in fig 3c and d two peaks located at 45 0 ev and 41 7 ev which were in accordance with the peaks of as iii within as2o3 and as 0 wang et al 2019b zhou et al 2004 were detected by xps analysis the proportions of as 0 in the precipitates for as v and as iii removal were calculated to be 99 69 wt and 99 58 wt respectively table s3 moreover the xrd spectra of precipitates fig 3e and f were consistent with the reported spectra of amorphous as 0 yang et al 2019 the above results verified that as 0 was the main component in the precipitates the existence of a small amount of as2o3 in the precipitates was attributed to the partial oxidation of as 0 by o2 during the preparation and storage of the samples the content of as 0 in the precipitates reached the purity requirement of commercial as 0 products 99 5 wt indicating that the obtained as 0 can be recovered thus as v and as iii can be reductively removed and recovered from aqueous solution in the form of valuable as 0 by the uv sulfite process 3 2 effects of reactive species and products on the removal of as v and as iii the reactive species intermediate species and products formed in the uv sulfite system were identified esr spectra obtained from the dmpo trapping experiments showed that no signal was detected in the dark while obvious signals were observed under uv irradiation fig 4 which can be ascribed to two dmpo adducts the first adduct which has six signal peaks with parameters of αn 14 7 g αβ h 16 1 g corresponds to the reported dmpo so3 signal αn 14 7 g αβ h 16 0 g shi and dalal 1990 zamora and villamena 2012 indicating the formation of so3 the second adduct which has five signal peaks with parameters of αn 16 6 g αβ h 22 4 g corresponds to the reported dmpo h signal αn 16 7 g αβ h 22 4 g perissinotti et al 2001 qin et al 2021 confirming the formation of h radicals it has been reported that reactive species i e eaq h and so3 radicals can form by the photolysis of so3 2 and hso3 eqs 1 and 2 li et al 2012 so3 2 dominates at ph 9 0 since sulfite has a pka of 7 2 and eaq initially forms under such a condition li et al 2012 the detection of h radicals is due to the rapid conversion between eaq and h eqs 3 5 buxton et al 1988 therefore eaq h and so3 form under such conditions in addition s2o6 2 and so4 2 which can be generated by the reaction of two so3 eqs 6 and 7 diester and warneck 1990 gu et al 2016 formed along with the decomposition of sulfite during the removal of arsenic fig s6 sulfur mass balance analysis showed that s2o6 2 and so4 2 were the only two sulfur containing products table s4 1 so 3 2 hv so 3 e aq 2 hso 3 hv so 3 h 3 e

experiments were conducted to investigate the roles of eaq and h in the removal of arsenic when an excellent eaq and h scavenger i e no2 10 mm eqs 8 and 9 buxton et al 1988 zhang et al 2022 was added to the arsenic uv sulfite system complete inhibition of as v and as iii removal was observed fig 5 a and b indicating that eaq and or h is responsible for the removal of arsenic in addition it has been reported that no3 can only efficiently react with eaq but not h radicals eqs 10 and 11 buxton et al 1988 zhang et al 2022 as shown in fig 5c and d the addition of 10 mm no3 reduced the arsenic removal rates of as v and as iii from 3 16 10 5 mm s 1 and 3 69 10 5 mm s 1 to 2 92 10 6 mm s 1 and 6 09 10 6 mm s 1 respectively it was calculated that eaq and h radicals accounted for 90 8 and 9 2 of as v removal and 83 5 and 16 5 of as iii removal respectively thus eaq plays a major role while h plays a minor role in the reduction of arsenic at ph 9 0 although the proportion of h is higher than that of eaq at ph 9 0 because the pka of h is 9 7 diester and warneck 1990 the key role of eaq in arsenic reduction may be due to its lower reduction potential 2 9 v than that of h 2 42 v which can reduce arsenic more efficiently 8 no 2 e aq no 2 2 k 4 1 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 9 no 2 h n o o h k 7 1 1 0 8 m 1 s 1 10 no 3 e aq no 3 2 k 9 7 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 11 no 3 h n o 3 h k 1 4 1 0 6 m 1 s 1 the effect of so3 s2o6 2 and so4 2 on the removal of arsenic was investigated as shown in fig 1f as v formed and gradually disappeared during as iii removal indicating that as iii was initially oxidized to as v in the uv sulfite system it is noted that although as iii can be oxidized to as v in the presence of o2 under uv irradiation without requiring any other chemical reagent it cannot be oxidized without o2 fig s7 ryu et al 2013 as shown in fig 5b the oxidation of as iii during as iii removal was greatly promoted when the reductive eaq and h radicals were quenched by no2 indicating that the oxidation should be caused by so3 s2o6 2 and so4 2 which are the only three species under such conditions it is known that so4 2 cannot oxidize as iii in addition the oxidation of as iii was negligible in the presence of s2o6 2 under dark anoxic conditions at ph 9 0 fig s8 which is consistent with the report xu et al 2016 because the standard reduction potential of s2o6 2 so3 2 couple 0 57 v bard et al 1985 is similar to that of as v as iii couple 0 56 v the oxidation of as iii should be attributed to the so3 radicals because the standard reduction potential of so3 so3 2 couple 0 63 v cao et al 2021 is higher than that of as v as iii couple 0 56 v the oxidation can thermodynamically occur which has been confirmed experimentally by a previous study zhang et al 2021 in addition s2o6 2 and so3 can oxidize as 0 to as iii because the standard reduction potentials of s2o6 2 so3 2 couple 0 57 v and so3 so3 2 couple 0 63 v are much higher than that of as iii as 0 couple 0 24 v although the oxidation and reduction processes coexist in the uv sulfite process the oxidation process was less important which may be due to that most of so3 radicals rapidly transformed into so4 2 eqs 6 and 7 3 3 effect of ph as shown in fig 6 a and b the removal rates of as v and as iii changed significantly at different ph values the removal rates of as v and as iii increased with the increase of solution ph from 5 0 to 9 0 the pka of sulfite is 7 2 thus hso3 dominates in the ph range from 4 0 to 6 0 and so3 2 dominates at ph values above 9 0 fig s9 from ph 5 0 to 9 0 the variation tendency of the arsenic removal rate seems to be consistent with that of the so3 2 distribution that is the arsenic removal rate increased with the increase of so3 2 proportion which may be due to the higher molar absorption coefficient of so3 2 18 01 m 1 cm 1 than those of hso3 0 18 m 1 cm 1 at 253 7 nm table s2 however the poor linear relationship between the arsenic removal rate and so3 2 proportion was observed from ph 5 0 to 9 0 fig 6c and d indicating that the variation tendency of the arsenic removal rate cannot be fully explained by the so3 2 proportion for instance according to the so3 2 distribution the removal rate of arsenic at ph 7 0 was expected to reach approximately 50 of that at ph 9 0 however the actual removal rate of arsenic at ph 7 0 was only 5 that of the rate at ph 9 0 the lower removal rate of arsenic at circumneutral ph may be due to the rapid eaq quenching effect of hso3 eq 12 yu et al 2018 leading to a decrease in the eaq concentration and thereby greatly inhibiting the removal rate of arsenic in addition the removal rates of as v and as iii remained unchanged with the further increases in solution ph from 9 0 to 11 0 since so3 2 dominates under such conditions 12 e aq hso 3 h so 3 2 k 2 1 0 7 m 1 s 1 moreover the removal rate of arsenic significantly decreased at ph 14 0 the variation in removal rate was not due to the speciation distribution of sulfite since so3 2 is the dominant species under such conditions this may be caused by the change in the speciation distribution of as v and as iii fig s10 because the different as v and as iii species can react with eaq with different rate constants for instance the reaction rate between h2aso4 and eaq 2 109 m 1 s 1 was 10 fold the reaction rate between haso4 2 and eaq 2 108 m 1 s 1 klaening et al 1989 therefore solution ph greatly affects the speciation distribution of sulfite as v and as iii and influences the interactions between sulfite and reactive species thereby affecting the removal efficiencies of as v and as iii 3 4 effect of dissolved o2 it has been reported that dissolved o2 greatly influences the removal and degradation of pollutants by the uv sulfite process cao et al 2021 li et al 2014b as shown in fig 7 the removal rates of as v and as iii by the uv sulfite process were inhibited in the presence of the dissolved o2 which decreased from 3 16 10 5 mm s 1 and 3 69 10 5 mm s 1 to 2 83 10 5 mm s 1 and 3 14 10 5 mm s 1 for as v and as iii removal respectively the dissolved o2 can not only efficiently scavenge eaq and h to form o2 radicals eqs 13 and 14 buxton et al 1988 but can also rapidly transform so3 into strongly oxidative so4 and so5 radicals eqs 15 18 cao et al 2021 luo et al 2019 in addition the dissolved o2 can also directly oxidize sulfite under alkaline conditions eq 19 norton et al 1968 in which the intermediate species i e so3 so4 so5 and o2 can also be generated eqs 15 19 li et al 2014b neta et al 1988 the inhibition effect was not only due to the oxidation of different arsenic species e g as 0 as iii and the intermediate arsenic species e g as iv by the so3 so4 so5 o2 radicals and o2 but was also ascribed to the decrease in sulfite concentration in solution caused by the oxidation of o2 which can lead to a further decrease in eaq and h the inhibitory effect of o2 on the removal of arsenic was limited at high sulfite concentrations in our study 13 3 mm fig 7 which is due to the low saturating concentration of o2 0 28 mm however it was found that the inhibition effect was promoted at a low sulfite concentration fig s11 for instance when treating wastewater with different arsenic concentrations at the same sulfite arsenic ratio the removal rate of arsenic is reduced by approximately 41 2 at a sulfite concentration of 1 33 mm and by 95 9 at a sulfite concentration of 0 665 mm thus wastewater should be deoxygenated in advance or the sulfite arsenic ratio should be increased especially when treating wastewater with low arsenic concentrations 13 e aq o 2 o 2 k 1 9 1 0 10 m 1 s 1 14 h o 2 o 2 h k 2 1 1 0 10 m 1 s 1 15 so 3 o 2 so 5 k 1 2 2 5 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 16 so 5 hso 3 hso 4 so 4 k 2 5 1 0 4 m 1 s 1 17 so 5 so 3 2 so 4 2 so 4

ha on the removal of as v and as iii were investigated fig 8 the presence of 10 mm co3 2 and po4 3 suppressed the removal of as v and as iii while 10 mm cl did not affect the removal of arsenic the inhibition effects of co3 2 and po4 3 were not due to the light blocking effect because of their low molar absorption coefficients at 253 7 nm 0 1 m 1 cm 1 table s2 it was reported that the rate constants of eaq reaction with co3 2 and po4 3 are 3 9 105 m 1 s 1 and 2 105 m 1 s 1 respectively ren et al 2021 in addition eaq is difficult to react with cl because it is in the lowest valance state the rate constants were consistent with the inhibition order co3 2 po4 3 cl suggesting that the scavenging of eaq h by these anions should be the most likely reason for the inhibition moreover it was found that 30 mg l 1 ca2 and mg2 have little effect on the removal of arsenic because of their low molar absorption coefficients and inert reaction with eaq h the removal rate constants of as v and as iii decreased from 3 16 10 5 mm s 1 and 3 69 10 5 mm s 1 in the absence of ha to 6 65 10 6 mm s 1 and 9 57 10 6 mm s 1 in the presence of 30 mg l 1 ha respectively the significant inhibition could be attributed to uv blocking and the eaq h scavenging effect it was found that 30 mg l 1 ha can greatly absorb uv light with an absorbance of 0 879 at 253 7 nm fig s12 absorbing 97 3 calculated by 1 10 εcl of uv light thus ha can strongly compete with sulfite for photons leading to a decrease in eaq h production cui et al 2020 uyguner and bekbolet 2005 in addition the chemical groups such as f cl br no2 cooh and cho in ha and its uv induced degradation products can rapidly react with eaq h cui et al 2020 li et al 2019 ha can compete with as v and as iii for eaq h thus inhibiting arsenic removal ren et al 2021 therefore a high concentration of ha as well as other organic compounds with similar functional groups should be removed before treatment 3 6 quantum yield of the uv sulfite process the quantum yield of eaq h formation ф1 at 253 7 nm at ph 9 0 is defined as the moles of the formed eaq h divided by the moles of photons absorbed by sulfite which can be calculated by the following equation eq 20 li et al 2012 20 φ 1 r 1 v i i 1 10 ε c l where r1 is the decomposition rate of sulfite i e the formation rate of eaq h v is the volume of the photoreactor 0 3 l ii is the incident photon flux 9 65 10 6 einstein s 1 ε is the molar extinction coefficient of sulfite 18 01 m 1 cm 1 at 253 7 nm at ph 9 0 table s2 c is the concentration of sulfite 0 0133 m and l is the reactor path length 1 79 cm as shown in fig s6 the decomposition rate of sulfite r1 in the removal of as v and as iii is 3 83 10 4 mm s 1 and 3 93 10 4 mm s 1 thus the quantum yields of eaq h formation ф1 at 253 7 nm in the removal of as v and as iii were calculated to be 0 0190 and 0 0195 mol einstein respectively in addition the quantum yield of as 0 formation ф2 which was defined as the moles of as 0 formed divided by the total photons absorbed by sulfite was calculated by replacing r1 with the formation rate of as 0 i e the removal rate of arsenic r2 the ф2 values for the removal of as v and as iii were calculated to be 0 00156 and 0 00183 mol einstein respectively assuming that all eaq h were captured by as v and as iii the effective quantum yield of eaq h formation ф3 can be calculated from ф2 by multiplying the number of electron transfers from as v as iii to as 0 thus the ф3 values in the removal of as v and as iii were calculated to be 0 0078 0 00156 5 and 0 0055 0 00183 3 mol einstein respectively which were lower than ф1 the lower ф3 suggested that the formed eaq h may not be fully involved in the reduction of as v and as iii or consumed by other processes the most likely reason for the lower ф3 was the oxidation of as 0 and as iii by so3 radicals which indirectly consumed eaq h in the uv sulfite system 3 7 removal mechanisms of as v and as iii by uv sulfite process the mechanism of the removal of as v and as iii from aqueous solution by the uv sulfite process was proposed as follows fig 9 the sulfite photolyzes into eaq h and so3 in which eaq h are responsible for the reduction of as v as iii assuming one electron consecutive steps as iv initially forms via the reduction of as v by eaq h eq 21 klaening et al 1989 levy et al 2012 which may be further reduced to as iii by eaq h eq 22 then as iii reacts with eaq h into as ii and as i and finally into as 0 eqs 23 25 levy et al 2012 in addition arsenic can also be reduced by the disproportionation of the intermediate species i e as iv as ii and as i eqs 26 28 klaening et al 1989 levy et al 2012 so3 radicals can oxidize as 0 and as iii eqs 29 and 30 thereby inhibiting the reduction of as v and as iii however the reduction process dominates while the oxidation process is secondary because of the rapid transformation of so3 into so4 2 and s2o6 2 21 as v e aq h as iv k 2 1 0 8 2 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 22 as iv e aq h as iii 23 as iii e aq h as ii k 5 5 7 1 0 8 m 1 s 1 24 as ii e aq h as i 25 as i e aq h as 0 26 as iv as iv as iii as v k 4 5 1 0 8 2 0 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 27 as ii as ii as i as iii 28 as i as i as ii as 0 29 so 3 as iii as iv so 3 2 30 so 3 as 0 as i so 3 2 in addition the reduction of as 0 with eaq h to produce ash3 is thermodynamically feasible because the reduction potential of the eaq 2 9 v and h h couple 2 42 v are much lower than that of the as 0 as iii couple 0 23 v bard et al 1985 however the ash3 gas analysis and arsenic mass balance analysis fig s13 both showed that ash3 was not generated during the removal of as v and as iii by the uv sulfite process these results indicated that the reduction of as 0 by eaq h is kinetically difficult which may be due to the high activation energy barrier of the reaction 3 8 application potential the feasibility of the proposed method was assessed in practical arsenic containing groundwater treatment as shown in fig 10 0 3 mg l 1 as v and 1 2 mg l 1 as iii were removed from groundwater by 2 mm sulfite after 35 min of uv irradiation with a residual arsenic concentration of 7 μg l 1 the purity of the obtained as 0 was as high as 99 56 wt fig s14 in addition the removal of as v and as iii from practical wastewater was only slightly lower than that from simulated wastewater in the absence of coexisting ions and doc indicating that the main constituents in practical wastewater do not significantly interfere with the removal of arsenic these results showed that the proposed method has strong adaptability to wastewater with complex water quality conditions and can effectively treat arsenic containing water the electrical energy per order of arsenic removal ee o which is defined as the electrical energy in kilowatt hours kwh required to achieve the degradation of a pollutant by the order of magnitude 90 removal in 1 m3 wastewater can be calculated according to eq 31 cao et al 2021 tan et al 2021 31 ee o prt 1000 v log c i c t kwh m 3 orde r 1 where p is the lamp power output kw r is the efficiency for uv energy utilization t is the irradiation time h v is the reactor volume l ci is the initial concentration of arsenic mg l 1 ct is the final concentration of arsenic mg l 1 it was calculated that the efficiency for uv energy utilization r was approximately 15 7 in which 13 8 of uv light was absorbed by sulfite and 1 9 by other constituents 1 9 in the photochemical reactor during the reaction tables s1 and s2 figs s2 s4 thus the ee o value was calculated to be 8 37 kwh m 3 order 1 based on the results of practical wastewater experiments the cost of industrial electricity is approximately 0 08 per kwh in china so the electrical cost of uv irradiation is approximately 0 67 per cubic meter of wastewater the cost of sulfite na2so3 0 28 kg was estimated to be 0 07 0 252 kg 0 28 kg per cubic meter of wastewater in addition approximately 1 5 g as 0 6200 t was obtained from each cubic meter of wastewater generating earnings of approximately 0 01 therefore the total cost of the proposed method was approximately 0 73 per cubic meter of wastewater the cost can further decrease through further optimization of the operational and reaction parameters thus the proposed method offers good application potential in arsenic removal and recovery 4 conclusions in summary this study proposed an effective uv sulfite advanced reduction method to remove and recover as v and as iii from aqueous solution in the form of valuable as 0 products thus avoiding the generation of arsenic containing hazardous waste more than 99 9 of arsenic 10 100 mg l 1 was reduced to high purity as 0 99 5 wt and the residual arsenic concentration in the solution was below 10 μg l 1 which met the requirements of the arsenic drinking water guideline 10 μg l 1 stipulated by the who the increased sulfite concentration is proportionally correlated with the enhanced removal rates of arsenic the eaq h and so3 radicals form by the photolysis of sulfite under uv irradiation at 253 7 nm of which eaq and h can reduce as v and as iii to as 0 the relatively lower quantum efficiency φ for as 0 formation was ascribed to the oxidation of as 0 and as iii by so3 radicals which indirectly consumed eaq h in the system the removal rate of arsenic increased with the increasing ph from 5 0 to 9 0 and remained constant when the ph further increased because of the higher photolysis efficiency of so3 2 than hso3 and the higher stability of eaq h under alkaline conditions the dissolved o2 no2 no3 co3 2 po4 3 and ha inhibited the removal of arsenic through light blocking or eaq h scavenging effects while cl ca2 and mg2 had negligible effects on arsenic reduction moreover arsenic can be efficiently removed and recovered from contaminated groundwater in the form of highly valuable as 0 at a low cost demonstrating that the proposed method is promising for practical arsenic containing water treatment

variability in the molecular composition within this classification has remained elusive thus limiting the interpretation of dom dynamics especially with respect to transport versus transformation patterns in response to hydrologic or landscape changes here leveraging high frequency spatiotemporal sampling during rainfall events at a critical zone observatory project site in clear creek iowa we apply a metabolomics based analysis validated with fragmentation using tandem mass spectrometry to uncover patterns in the molecular features of the dom composition that were not resolved by classification based on stoichiometric ratios in the chemical formulae from upstream to downstream sites beyond the increased aromaticity implied by changes in the stoichiometric ratios we identified an increased abundance of flavonoids and other phenylpropanoids two important subgroups of aromatic compounds the stoichiometric analysis also proposed a localized decline in the abundance of lipid like compounds which we attributed specifically to medium chain and short chain fatty acids other lipids such as long chain fatty acids and sterol lipids remained unchanged we further determined in stream molecular transitions and specific compound degradation by capturing changes in the molecular masses of terpenoids phenylpropanoids fatty acids and amino acids in sum the metabolomics analysis of the chemical formulae resolved molecular variability imprinted on the stoichiometric dom composition to implicate key molecular subgroups underlying carbon transport and cycling dynamics in the

the composition of stream dissolved organic matter dom which is considered to be of terrestrial allochthonous sources from surrounding landscapes or of aquatic autochthonous sources due to in stream metabolic activities can be influenced by biological chemical and physical processes bauer and bianchi 2012 fasching et al 2020 2016 giorgio and pace 2021 lynch et al 2019 stutter et al 2013 tanentzap et al 2019 therefore along a stream path the diversity of dom composition is expected to depend on the source and levels of dom in the headwaters the fresh dom input from the landscape and the extent of dom transformation within the stream creed et al 2015 giorgio and pace 2021 kamjunke et al 2019 lynch et al 2019 singh et al 2014 traditionally the chemical composition and functional properties of natural dom have been inferred using chromophoric and fluorescent properties bhattacharya and osburn 2020 vione et al 2021 yang et al 2015 recent applications of high resolution mass spectrometry hrms based approaches using primarily fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry fticr ms have led to an unprecedented molecular investigation of dom dynamics in terrestrial waters based on the stoichiometric ratio representation of chemical formulae often illustrated by a van krevelen diagram gonsior et al 2011 maizel et al 2017 mcdonough et al 2020 phungsai et al 2016 sleighter and hatcher 2008 valle et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 to date van krevelen analyses have provided valuable information on dom composition dynamics and transformations in aquatic environments pang et al 2021 riedel et al 2016 however the van krevelen diagram used as a classical two dimensional stoichiometry dependent chemical class assignment primarily based on three elements carbon c oxygen o and hydrogen h provides a limited categorization of biomolecules and thus may lead to incorrect classification of molecular classes rivas ubach et al 2018 a recently proposed multidimensional stoichiometric compound msc classification approach rivas ubach et al 2018 which was validated by including six abundant elements c h o nitrogen n phosphorus p and sulfur s enabled the classification of compounds into five groups phytochemicals carbohydrates nucleotides proteins lipids and amino sugars these molecular groups refer to broad classes of biomolecules except that phytochemicals represent a diverse group of keto aromatic biomolecules that could be derived from plants algae and microorganisms despite the diverse molecular profiles of compounds within each stoichiometry based molecular grouping within group molecular variability has not been explored such high resolution molecular information is necessary for the accurate evaluation of the stream dom dynamics and transformation garayburu caruso et al 2020 lynch et al 2019 which is crucial in determining lability persistence metabolism and functional identity of the dom composition cyle et al 2020 lusk and toor 2016 lynch et al 2019 remucal et al 2012 water flow promotes the connectivity of carbon pools between the landscape and aquatic environments and contributes to the flushing of organic matter from riparian areas and soil surfaces into surrounding streams fasching et al 2016 lynch et al 2019 singh et al 2014 the dom export during storm events which can comprise two thirds of the stream dom load annually can introduce rapid changes in the molecular features in the dom composition along the stream path creed et al 2015 oeurng et al 2011 this dom export can result in elevated levels of vascular plant derived organic matter with high molecular complexity and aromaticity from terrestrial sources whereas base flow associated dom may contain a high fraction of protein like and lipid like compounds derived from autochthonous sources lu and liu 2019 moreover increased heteroatom content of the dom observed in the downstream areas including wetlands are often attributed to autochthonous sources due to microbial and algal metabolism fasching et al 2020 fellman et al 2009 beyond broad classification based on chromophoric and fluorescent properties and stoichiometric analysis still lacking is an in depth and high resolution characterization to capture molecular characteristics of spatial and temporal variations of stream dom composition here we seek to obtain this molecular characterization for the stream dom in clear creek iowa a site extensively characterized by the intensively managed landscapes critical zone observatory iml czo project and other studies papanicolau et al 2010 hou et al 2018 kim et al 2020 blair et al 2021 and citations within high resolution time resolved stream sampling was performed at three locations along an approximately 45 km stretch of clear creek immediately prior to and following a spring storm event fig 1 a supplementary fig s1 the upland agricultural portions of the watershed have steeper hillslopes that facilitate connectivity between the erodible surfaces and the channel fig 1a runoff from floodplains and forested riparian buffers which are prevalent downstream intercept agricultural runoff from upstream blair et al 2021 therefore the different landscape features of this watershed provide an appropriate case study to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics in our molecular investigation of the stream dom composition fig 1a the application of a metabolomics based high resolution chemical fingerprinting of small compounds or metabolites derived from plants and microorganisms is an attractive method to advance a molecular understanding of the source and fate of stream dom lynch et al 2019 fig 1b using high performance liquid chromatography lc coupled with orbitrap based hrms for an untargeted investigation we characterized molecular variabilities in the stream dom composition dynamics using metabolomics based molecular identities and for comparative analysis stoichiometry dependent msc classification fig 1b 2 site description and methods 2 1 site description clear creek a tributary of the iowa river in east central iowa usa drains an approximate 275 km2 watershed blair et al 2021 hou et al 2018 kim et al 2020 the baseflow in this watershed is driven by groundwater and subsurface agricultural drainage or tile drainage which could contribute up to 50 of the streamflow schilling et al 2012 schilling and helmers 2010 soils in the clear creek watershed are silty clay to silt loam mollisols and alfisols with an organic carbon content ranging from 2 wt in agricultural soils to 4 wt in restored prairie soils hou et al 2018 prior to the start of the growing season which begins in early may and continues until early october flash floods can result due to intense storms lack of vegetation cover and fine soil textures hou et al 2018 kim et al 2020 the south amana site captures a predominantly headwater signature from mostly tile drained croplands dominated by corn soybean crop rotations blair et al 2021 land use in the south amana sub basin comprised 86 agricultural 6 developed and 8 natural lands the subtle v shaped cross section of the valley facilitates the transport of hillslope erosion from the fields to the channel by contrast the valley cross section of the downstream sites oxford and coralville is more u or box shaped due to the presence of floodplains the oxford site is downstream of a small town oxford iowa and receives water from a mixture of forest and grass lands 23 though corn and soybean cultivation still dominates 69 papanicolaou et al 2010 the coralville station integrates water from 92 of the clear creek watershed comprising 60 agricultural and 28 natural lands urban land use which is low 11 is localized in the downstream portion of the coralville sub basin the three sampling sites along clear creek capture dom export from the upper sub basin south amana middle sub basin oxford and lower sub basin coralville locations fig 1a the drainage area for these three sites is 26 2 157 5 and 254 3 km2 respectively blair et al 2021 the geomorphology of this river corridor has been implicated in the temporal within a storm event and spatial downstream transport responses of particulate organic carbon poc in previous studies blair et al 2021 kim et al 2020 water discharge at south amana was determined using a stage discharge relationship as previously detailed blair et al 2021 discharge for oxford and coralville were obtained from the usgs website https waterdata usgs gov ia nwis gaging stations 05454200 and 05454300 respectively 2 2 sample collection a total of 63 stream water samples were acquired from the three sampling locations at 2 to 4 h intervals over a near 48 h period to cover shortly before and during a spring storm event march 29th to march 31st 2017 in coordination with the iml czo kim et al 2020 for each sample 800 ml of stream water was collected using isco autosamplers teledyne isco with 1 l nalgene bottles after triple rinsing the sampling line with stream water after collection the samples were filtered through pre combusted fiber filters 0 7 µm pore size millipore and were kept frozen until further analysis the hourly precipitation data for nearby iowa city from the iowa state environmental mesonet website https mesonet agron iastate edu showed that a total of 32 5 mm of rainfall occurred during the study period 2 3 dissolved organic carbon doc and metabolomics based analyses first using an apollo 9000 toc combustion analyzer teledyne tekmar co we quantified the doc concentration at each sampling point for each station for this toc analysis standards were run at the start in the middle and at the end of the analysis run for each set of samples analyzed for independent quality checks

camera package in r kuhl et al 2012 following deduction of chloride ion adducts and isotopic daughter ions the spectral features were further refined by applying blank subtraction min signal blank ratio 5 and identifying peaks in technical duplicates using an in house code in r programming environment venables et al 2020 to annotate chemical formulae the omicscraft online database http tools omicscraft com metaboquest was used to search the m z against different compound databases pubchem hmdb lipid maps kegg and mmcd with the mass tolerance of 20 ppm the majority of annotated chemical formulae 75 had a mass error of 10 ppm first the annotated chemical formulae were categorized using the stoichiometry dependent msc classification approach which considers the heteroatom content of biomolecules c h o n p s and four different stoichiometric ratios o c h c n c p c to classify compounds as carbohydrate like carbohydrates and amino sugars lipid like nucleotide like phytochemicals or protein like rivas ubach et al 2018 second the annotated chemical formulae were subjected to metabolomics based classification by cross referencing the returned results with kegg brite hierarchy files https www kegg jp using an r code followed by manually scrutinizing each group for accuracy for simplicity of presentation the metabolites were grouped into 14 categories flavonoids phenylpropanoids terpenoids alkaloids polyketides glycosides fatty acids other lipids e g fatty acyls and sterol lipids carbohydrates amino acids including dipeptides carboxylic acids nucleotides and their associated derivatives nucleotides nucleosides and nucleobases other secondary metabolites betalains natural toxins vitamins cofactors hormones and transmitters and multiclass isomers chemical formulae with multiple entries in the kegg database regarding their functional categorization we employed collision induced ms ms or tandem ms analysis to obtain fragmentation patterns to resolve uncertainties in determining chemical structures especially when the metabolomics based classification of a compound differed from or was not determined by the msc classification data dependent acquisition top 5 peaks with normalized collision energies of 15 30 and 45 were used on a selected number of samples 4 from each site fragmentation spectra were acquired at resolution 17 500 precursor ions were isolated

f test t test and multivariant analysis and data visualization based on kernel density estimation were performed in jmp statistical discovery from sas institute inc multivariant analysis including principal component analysis pca and redundancy analysis is widely used to connect metrics of dom composition and landscape characteristics bhattacharya and osburn 2020 frost et al 2006 graeber et al 2012 we conducted the pca analysis to evaluate the correlation between the molecular groupings of chemical formulae with respect to the discharge and location along the stream for this analysis to account for the impact of increased flow from upstream to downstream discharge q was normalized by maximum discharge at each site qmax in addition the abundance for each molecular group at each site was normalized by the total number of characterized compounds at each site 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal dom variations as a function of discharge first we examined changes in the doc levels in response to the storm event at the three site locations fig 1a c at both south amana and coralville there was no clear trend between the discharge and the doc concentrations supplementary fig s2 which varied from 14 9 mg l 1 to 20 9 mg l 1 and from 11 7 mg l 1 to 18 7 mg l 1 respectively fig 1c however at oxford a steady decrease in doc concentration from 36 8 mg l 1 to 13 4 mg l 1 during the storm event reflected a doc dilution at this site which would result from a limited doc input as a function of the increased discharge at this site singh dhillon and inamdar 2014 fig 1c the highest compound diversity was found at the midstream oxford site fig 1d while we annotated 2441 chemical compounds 1810 unique chemical formulae by excluding isomers at oxford we only found a total of 1509 chemical compounds 1192 unique chemical formulae at south amana and 1633 chemical compounds 1361 unique chemical formulae at coralville fig 1d markedly the identification of a relatively small amount 358 of common chemical formulae across all three site locations highlighted the spatial variation in the dom chemical composition in clear creek implying a fast turnover of the dom consistent with the lack of increasing doc concentration during the storm fig 1d at south amana there was a small temporal variability in the number of compounds from 1007 to 1089 from the start to the end of the study period with 41 of the compounds consistently present at all samples across the sampling time fig 1e supplementary fig s3 at oxford the dynamic appearance and disappearance of compounds at each subsequent sampling time resulted in an overall 50 decrease in the number of distinct compounds by the end of the sampling period fig 1e at coralville these dynamic changes led to an overall 15 decrease in the number of identified compounds by the end of the storm fig 1e therefore relatively greater temporal variations at oxford and coralville relative to south amana during the storm implied the influence of different dom source contributions or dom transformations at the different sites supplementary fig s3 to obtain further insights into changes in the molecular identities of the compounds we first evaluated changes in the dom stoichiometry fig 2 3 2 dom stoichiometry implies dynamics in molecular diversity most annotated compounds 80 had o c ratios 0 5 which have been attributed previously to lipids proteins and lignin derived compounds fig 2a d andrilli et al 2013 lu et al 2015 rivas ubach et al 2018 while the oxford site had the most o containing compounds consistent with its high compound diversity the average o c ratio 0 42 was the greatest at coralville highlighting the presence of relatively more oxidized compounds at the downstream location fig 2a supplementary fig s5 at the beginning of the storm compounds had well distributed h c between 1 and 2 1 at all three sites indicating the presence of diverse compounds in the stream before the rise of the discharge as was also reported for poc fig 2a rivas ubach et al 2018 approximately 20 of unsaturated compounds with high aromaticity and fewer alkyl groups h c 1 3 disappeared by the peak of the flow and those with h c 1 3 persisted at south amana and at oxford fig 2a during the receding limb of the hydrograph at oxford when the influence of subsurface interflow would be more pronounced than at the rising limb compounds with relatively higher h c ratios 1 5 h c 2 became predominant fig 2a at the downstream location coralville the average h c ratio 1 27 of the compounds was lower than the two upstream sites average h c 1 37 p 0 05 fig 2a supplementary fig s4 indicating a shift to unsaturated compounds both with fewer alkyl groups and with increased aromaticity downstream the proportion of n containing chemical formulae 44 49 was relatively higher than reported previously in terrestrial lakes 12 32 gonsior et al 2011 maizel et al 2017 lake sediments 21 34 zhang et al 2018 and the ocean up to 10 sleighter and hatcher 2008 supplementary fig s5 at south amana and oxford the n c values of the compounds remained relatively constant 0 n c 0 5 during the sampling period but the peak discharge at coralville revealed the transport of compounds with higher n c values fig 2a coralville had the highest average n c value 0 26 among the three sites p 0 001 supplementary fig s4 a small percentage 6 8 of the compounds had p in their chemical composition fig 2a rivas ubach et al 2018 the p c ratio in most of these compounds remained the same at about p c 0 1 but the density of p containing compounds with this p c ratio increased downstream over the sampling period fig 2a most detected s containing compounds had one s atom in their chemical composition at all three sites before and after the storm stressing the persisting presence of mono thiolated compounds such as cysteine and glutathione or the presence of sulfonated compounds widely detected in natural waters chu et al 2016 low abundance of di sulfated compounds with two s which could include cystine a cysteine dimer was also detected fig 2a instead of the widely used van krevelen plots whose compound classification is based on the atomic ratios of h c versus o c supplementary fig s6 we analyzed the abundance of compounds in relation to the atomic ratios of o c h c n c and p c present in the chemical formulae using the msc classification to obtain five stoichiometry based groupings of the annotated compounds fig 1b rivas ubach et al 2018 the majority of the compounds across the three sites were classified as phytochemical like 28 34 and lipid like 22 31 compounds whereby the percentage of phytochemical like compounds increased from upstream to downstream accompanied by a decrease in the proportion of more labile lipid like compounds fig 2b and supplemental table s1 consistent with previous reports of preferential degradation of lipid like compounds ladd et al 2021 protein like compounds comprised 12 13 of the annotated compounds fig 2b carbohydrate like 2 4 and nucleotide like 1 compounds comprised a small fraction of the classified compounds fig 2b regarding the phytochemical like compounds they were clustered primarily at two ranges of m z of 200 and at 350 at south amana but at oxford these compounds had a well distributed m z during the rising limb of the hydrograph and at coralville phytochemical like compounds with lower m z were less abundant fig 2c at the beginning of the sampling period at all three sites there were well distributed m z values 200 400 of lipid like compounds fig 2c as discharge increased at south amana the abundance of low molecular mass lipid like compounds m z 300 diminished fig 2c by contrast at oxford the lipid like compounds with a wide range of m z values declined steadily during the storm fig 2c supplementary fig s7 and at coralville the lipid like compounds had relatively constant m z values during the study period but there was a surge in lipid like compounds with 200 m z 400 after the early flush first 30 h fig 2c for protein like compounds the range of the m z values at south amana decreased at the crest of the hydrograph when the abundance of compounds with m z 300 declined but at coralville these compounds appeared after the early flush implying their upstream to downstream transport fig 2c the majority of carbohydrate like and nucleotide like compounds had a relatively constant abundance and m z 150 200 m z for carbohydrate like compounds and 350 m z for nucleotide like compounds along the stream and during the study period fig 2c supplementary fig s7 in sum the stoichiometry based data analysis implied from upstream to downstream sites an enrichment in aromatic plant derived compounds and a preferential decomposition of lipid like compounds which were reported previously to be bioreactive ladd et al 2021 lu et al 2015 3 3 high resolution metabolomics based molecular characterization with fragmentation validation to capture variability in the molecular level composition of the aforementioned broad stoichiometry based classification of the dom dynamics we subjected the lc hrms data to a metabolomics based analysis scheme for the identification of specific compounds or derivatives from plant and microbial metabolism figs 1b and 3 the compound identities based on the metabolomics based analysis 13 of the total unique chemical formulae were classified into the following 14 molecular groupings of metabolites with functional roles in metabolism carboxylic acids amino acids including dipeptides carbohydrates including monosaccharides disaccharides and amino sugars flavonoids terpenoids alkaloids other phenylpropanoids glycosides polyketides fatty acids other lipids nucleotides and their derivatives multiclass isomers and other secondary metabolites fig 3 towards validating our metabolomics based molecular grouping we also performed ms ms fragmentation analysis to obtain molecular fragments determinants of specific molecular functional classes particularly for compounds that were categorized differently by the msc classification fig 3a for instance tyrosine an aromatic amino acid which was considered a phytochemical like compound by the broad msc classification was classified correctly as an amino acid by the metabolomics based protocol through the identification of the carboxyl amino moiety m z 72 0077 fig 3a guanosine correctly binned as a nucleotide derivative through metabolomics based assignment via the guanine fragment m z 150 0414 was classified incorrectly as a protein like compound by msc classification fig 3a several glycosides which generate a sugar fragment and at times contained lipid components were categorized broadly as carbohydrate like or lipid like by the stoichiometry based analysis fig 3a and 3 for example 8 epideoxyloganic acid is a terpene glycoside or an iridoid glycoside which contains both lipid and sugar moieties but it was annotated as lipid like compound by the msc approach fig 3a importantly our metabolomics based scheme identified carboxylic acids which were among the uncategorized compounds or incorrectly annotated as carbohydrate like compounds under the msc classification fig 3a and b for all the cross categorized chemical formulae the agreement between the msc and metabolomics based classifications varied between 44 and 100 fig 3b we found that 100 of the chemical formulae categorized as nucleotide like compounds by the msc classification were assigned as nucleotides or nucleotide derivatives by the metabolomics assisted approach fig 3b moreover based on the metabolomics based classification 71 of the compounds classified as carbohydrate like were found to be carbohydrates fig 3b however among those compounds broadly grouped as protein like by msc classification the metabolomics based assignment determined that 44 of them belonged to amino acids and dipeptides furthermore due to stoichiometric similarities with small peptides as n containing compounds the msc approach categorized nucleotides as protein like compounds but they were assigned accurately as nucleotides or nucleotide derivatives by the metabolomics analysis we note however that proteins and large peptides were not characterized by the metabolomics based approach fig 3b a large fraction 79 of phytochemical like compounds was assigned to compounds generally attributed to plant derived compounds such as flavonoids alkaloids and phenylpropanoids a small fraction 5 was annotated as other secondary metabolites such as betalains fig 3b still there are important groups of plant derived compounds including alkaloids and terpenoids which were not categorized by the msc approach but were captured by the metabolomics analysis fig 3b furthermore a diverse group of metabolomics identified compounds including carboxylic acids e g hydroxybutyric acid fig 3a short chain fatty acids nucleotides and their derivatives remained uncategorized by the msc approach fig 3b in sum these aforementioned differences in the compound categorizations by the metabolomics based approach highlight the broad mis categorization or lack of categorization by the msc approach fig 3b therefore the metabolomics based assignments offered additional and detailed molecular insights into the stream dom dynamics beyond the molecular features proposed by the msc classification fig 3b these new insights afforded a new picture of the molecular variability in the stream dom as discussed in the following section 3 4 metabolomics based analysis of spatial and temporal molecular variability in stream dom here we present the insights into the spatiotemporal molecular transitions resulting from the metabolomics based analysis in relation to the dynamic changes in the broad molecular classes deduced from the stoichiometric patterns of the dom we analyzed the abundances of the metabolomics based group of metabolites associated with each molecular class as well as within group dynamics of the metabolites by monitoring changes in m z along the steam fig 4 supplementary figs s7 and s8 at south amana during the rising limb of the hydrograph we found that an initial increase from 316 to 409 and subsequent decrease to 362 in the abundance of lipid like compounds coincided with increased abundance of fatty acids and other lipids at this site supplementary figs s7 and s8 at oxford among the decreased abundance observed for a diverse group of compounds during the storm lipid like compounds had the sharpest decline from 577 to 282 supplementary fig s7 the metabolomics based analysis determined that this decline was attributed primarily to a decrease in the number of fatty acids from 99 to 16 at oxford while there were minimal changes in the abundance of other lipids predominantly fatty acyls and sterol lipids during the storm event supplementary fig s8 at coralville the abundance of different compounds changed dynamically during the early flush of the storm event supplementary fig s8 for instance the number of identified fatty acids fluctuated between 9 and 35 during this period or between 8 and 32 for nucleotides and associated derivatives supplementary fig s8 analysis of within group dynamics of the metabolites revealed that medium chain fatty acids c16 c18 m z 250 were the most abundant at south amana but short chain fatty acids appeared at oxford and coralville fig 4a moreover the abundance of other lipids with m z of 300 350 corresponding to sterol lipids remained the same across all three sites furthermore in accordance with increased abundance from 296 to 372 of phytochemical like or keto aromatic compounds during the rising limb of the hydrograph followed by a decline during the falling limb to 330 the metabolomics based analysis revealed a corresponding pattern for the flavonoids supplementary fig s7 and s8 specifically a shift from high molecular weight compounds 400 m z 500 to the low molecular weight compounds 250 m z 350 in the abundance of flavonoids was reminiscent of the breakdown of the glycosylic bond facilitated by glycosyl hydrolases or related enzymes commonly found in streams hill et al 2010 santos et al 2019 such breakdown pattern was also manifested in the disappearance of other glycosides with high m z 400 m z 450 at coralville fig 4 in addition a shift in m z values was also observed for other phenylpropanoids from 300 m z 400 to 200 m z 300 fig 4 furthermore a decreased abundance of low molecular weight terpenoids m z 250 downstream also reflected the degradation in the terpenoid group of compounds fig 4 in contrast the consistent occurrence of similar m z values for both amino acids and carboxylic acids at all three sites reflected the ubiquity of these compounds in natural waters fig 4 mostofa et al 2013 to explore further the spatiotemporal molecular variations in the dom dynamics we performed principal component analysis pca to evaluate variation in the normalized abundance of chemical formulae in each molecular grouping using either msc classification or metabolomics based analysis with respect to the different sites the falling and rising limb of the storm hydrograph the doc concentration and the normalized discharge fig 5 for msc classification the first principal component pc1 explained 55 variations in the abundance of annotated compounds fig 5 this component positively corresponded with phytochemical like 33 loading nucleotide like 28 loading protein like 3 2 loading and carbohydrate like 0 5 loading compounds and negatively corresponded with lipid like compounds 34 loading fig 5 the second principal component pc2 explained 27 of the variations and largely corresponded with protein like 43 loading carbohydrate like 54 loading and lipid like 1 6 loading compounds fig 5 for compounds classified by the metabolomics based approach the pc1 and pc2 together explained 58 6 of the variation fig 5 the pc1 was positively associated with flavonoids 15 loading other phenylpropanoids 14 loading and polyketides comprised of mono and polycyclic aromatics 7 loading and negatively corresponded with fatty acids 7 2 loading other lipids 14 loading fig 5 the pc2 was positively associated with fatty acids 9 loading and other lipids 1 loading fig 5 notably for both msc and metabolomics based classifications the pc1 distinguished coralville the downstream site from the other two upstream sites and the pc2 separated south amana and oxford the upstream sites both the flow stage i e rising and falling limb of hydrograph and discharge played a small role in explaining the variability of the abundance of molecules while doc levels correlated negatively with pc1 fig 5 therefore for the compounds classified by either msc or metabolomics based classification approaches the pca revealed a divergence in the molecular composition of the doc from upstream to downstream sites and highlighted a greater impact of spatial location compared to storm hydrograph in maintaining this divergence fig 5 firstly the pca of compounds categorized by the msc classification confirmed a transition from a high abundance of lipid like compounds at south amana to an enrichment of phytochemical like or keto aromatic compounds at coralville fig 5 these changes in the molecular patterns of the dom could implicate different spatiotemporal contributions of dom inputs or different transport of the dom along the stream providing high resolution molecular insights on the identities of the phytochemical like compounds associated with coralville the pca of the metabolomics based classification of compounds correlated flavonoids phenylpropanoids and both mono and polycyclic aromatics with this downstream location demonstrating a molecular signature of plant derived compounds sourced from the different agricultural and forested areas in the watershed fig 5 secondly the abundance of n containing metabolites amino acids nucleotides and derivatives correlated positively with both pc1 6 loading and pc2 3 loading consistent with a low percentage of n containing compounds at oxford fig 5 supplementary fig s5 thirdly glycosides and carbohydrates negatively corresponded with pc1 and pc2 fig 5 fourthly the pca of the metabolites depicted the consistent presence of carboxylic acids at all three sites in the stream fig 5 characterized by a weak correlation with pc1 2 loading and no correlation with pc2 fig 5 taken collectively the statistical analysis of our data identified the sampling location as the primary determinant of dom variability in relation to the change in landscape features and in stream processes at each location 4 discussion elucidating temporal and spatial changes in the dom composition of streams and rivers is critical to unraveling the role of this dom in the cycling and transport fluxes of carbon in a watershed towards deciphering the chemical diversity of aquatic dom underlying these fluxes has been the application of high resolution mass spectrometry to annotate chemical formulae d andrilli et al 2013 gonsior et al 2011 lu et al 2015 maizel et al 2017 sleighter and hatcher 2008 zhang et al 2018 these chemical formulae are typically analyzed based on stoichiometric ratio relationships to determine their classification with respect to broad molecular categories thereby resulting in low resolution elucidation of the molecular patterns in dom composition capturing high resolution molecular patterns is especially important in streams and rivers wherein dom composition is highly dynamic due to beyond the dom sourcing from the surrounding landscape and in stream biotic and abiotic processes hydrologic events that control the load and residence of dom spatially and temporally battin et al 2009 bauer and bianchi 2012 creed et al 2015 fasching et al 2020 2016 fellman et al 2009 giorgio and pace 2021 lu and liu 2019 lynch et al 2019 oeurng et al 2011 singh et al 2014 tanentzap et al 2019 here to advance high resolution molecular characterization of stream dom dynamics we performed a metabolomics based analysis of dom from high frequency sampling at three different sites on a small stream through a storm event the measured doc concentrations at clear creek were within the doc range observed in streams and agricultural effluents dhillon and inamdar 2013 hassanpour et al 2017 wise et al 2020 importantly our metabolomics based analysis captured different patterns in the molecular composition of the stream dom at the different sites which shed light on the spatiotemporal dynamics of dom cycling and transport beyond what could be achieved solely based on a stoichiometric based analysis indeed stoichiometry of chemical formulae can provide valuable preliminary insights into the dom dynamics in the stream with respect to the extent of oxidation aromaticity and heteroatom content roth et al 2019 increased heteroatom content of compounds in the downstream location has been previously attributed mainly to autochthonous production d andrilli et al 2013 maizel et al 2017 rivas ubach et al 2018 here our data depicted a time dependent heteroatom content related to discharge during the storm event thus illustrating an association between dom transport and dynamics in heteroatom composition that could be due to transport of diverse dom derived from both allochthonous and autochthonous production in the stream in lieu of the widely used van krevelen plots which may result in inaccurate assignments of biomolecules solely based on the atomic ratios of h c versus o c lu et al 2015 rivas ubach et al 2018 we employed the msc classification to analyze the abundance of compounds in relation to multiple atomic ratios of o c h c n c and p c present in the chemical formulae rivas ubach et al 2018 in sum from upstream to downstream sites the stoichiometry based analysis highlighted an enrichment in phytochemical like compounds broadly representing keto aromatic compounds and depletion of lipid like and protein like compounds the greater abundance of lipid like and protein like compounds at the upstream site could be attributed to greater slope upstream to result in greater contribution of groundwater from soil profiles frost et al 2006 enriched in compounds of microbial origins and relatively depleted in plant derived compounds kaiser and kalbitz 2012 roth et al 2019 due to lower mobility of these compounds adsorbed to soil particles mcdonough et al 2020 moreover the metabolomics based analysis revealed that the increased abundance of keto aromatic moieties of relatively lower molecular weights was due to the breakdown of flavonoids and other phenylpropanoids fig 6 which are components of tannins commonly found in stream dom leenheer and rostad 2004 lu and liu 2019 decreasing molecular weight and increasing aromaticity in the outlet of watersheds were previously connected to photo and microbial degradation lambert et al 2015 and low molecular weight organic compounds were observed previously to tend to be susceptible to degradation hodgkins et al 2016 roth et al 2019 valle et al 2020 furthermore we determined that spatial changes in the abundance of lipid like compounds were due to localized depletion or enrichment of short chain and medium chain fatty acids at each site whereas sterol lipids remained unchanged throughout fig 6 we also captured persistence of small amino acids in all three sites disappearance of selected carboxylic acids at the downstream site and breakdown of glycosides at the downstream sites fig 6 glycosides are seldom detected in natural water samples partly due to organic matter extraction methods that hydrolyze the glycosidic bond but the presence of glycosides in water has ecosystem implications due to their antimicrobial characteristics hawkes et al 2018 merder et al 2021 short chain carboxylic acids c 6 which are not specifically characterized by stoichiometric ratio relationships despite being a common component of natural organic matter adeleke et al 2017 aristilde et al 2017a are ubiquitous in stream waters as they have high turnover rates küsel and drake 1998 and can be produced both biotically or abiotically by photo oxidation hassanpour and aristilde 2021 moran and zepp 1997 in headwaters of large watersheds increased discharge has been reported to promote better connections between river channels thus leading to a convergent dom composition with greater similarities due to a greater mixing and availability of nutrients lynch et al 2019 along a stream the river continuum concept vannote et al 1980 suggests a continual decrease in the molecular diversity of dom although this shift can be influenced by landscape features and anthropogenic activities creed et al 2015 kamjunke et al 2019 especially in small streams here in clear creek site specific inputs from natural areas and tributaries contributed to the increased molecular diversity and doc concentrations from the upstream site south amana to midstream site oxford however an inverse association between doc and the downstream site coralville fig 5 presumably due to both the contribution of a larger area of the watershed and increased retention time at this downstream site in addition to the immediate urban areas surrounding this site frost et al 2006 temporal changes of dom composition based on our untargeted metabolomics based analysis at the upstream location of south amana were similar to those reported for the poc using targeted analysis of biomarker compounds blair et al 2021 kim et al 2020 the input sequence of poc into clear creek was identified to be fatty acids due to in channel sources dominated by algae lignin phenols from surface soils from row crop fields and finally a complex mixture of upstream sources that became increasingly dominated by channel bank erosional material with transport downstream blair et al 2021 kim et al 2020 at the downstream locations oxford and coralville however the patterns of doc and poc differed facilitated transport of doc as a result of the storm flow was not observed at the oxford site contrasting the observation that poc at clear creek was mobilized during storm events due increased sediment erosion kim et al 2020 specifically in lieu of the reported significant mobilization of poc by erosive forces singh dhillon and inamdar 2014 the decrease in compound diversity along with the dilution of the doc concentration at the oxford site indicated the lack of sufficient increase in new doc inputs during the increased runoff albeit differences between poc and doc trends may be season dependent we acknowledge that our metabolomics based approach was focused on small molecules m z 840 and comprehensive classification of the annotated chemical formulae is currently not possible due to compound coverage limitation in existing metabolomics databases nevertheless the metabolomics based analysis presented here spanned a wide variety of compounds belonging to a diverse array of molecular subgroups that are relevant and significant in environmental samples 5 conclusion an important component of carbon cycling in a watershed is the fate of dom in streams and rivers the advent of high resolution mass spectrometry based techniques has advanced molecular understanding of the chemical diversity of aquatic dom however stoichiometry focused analysis of chemical formulae has led to a limited understanding of the dynamic changes in the dom composition due to low resolution molecular classification here we employed a metabolomics based approach to achieve high resolution fingerprinting of molecular derivatives of plant and microbial metabolism we obtained spatiotemporal molecular insights into the dom composition of a stream traversing different landscape types interestingly using either the stoichiometry based or the metabolomics based classification statistical data analysis attributed the dynamic change in the molecular classes or groupings at each site in the stream to carbon flux from the surrounding landscapes combined with in stream transformations while the flow stage and the increased discharge played a limited role however the metabolomics based analysis afforded high resolution evaluation of the spatial divergence in the molecular identities of the compounds which was not resolved by the stoichiometric analysis for instance increased abundance of phytochemical like compounds was due to the dynamics of specific molecular subgroups captured by metabolomics based analysis involving increased abundance of polyketides flavonoids and other phenylpropanoids from upstream to downstream through several illustrations of the spatiotemporal molecular variations of the dom composition in the clear creek corridor we demonstrate here that metabolomics based analysis can offer additional molecular insights consistent with or unresolved by stoichiometric classification thus the application of such metabolomics based analysis combined with stoichiometric based categorization can advance our molecular understanding of the fate of carbon in aquatic environments a critical

15579,broad molecular classification based on stoichiometric ratio relationships has been used extensively to characterize the chemical diversity of aquatic dissolved organic matter dom however variability in the molecular composition within this classification has remained elusive thus limiting the interpretation of dom dynamics especially with respect to transport versus transformation patterns in response to hydrologic or landscape changes here leveraging high frequency spatiotemporal sampling during rainfall events at a critical zone observatory project site in clear creek iowa we apply a metabolomics based analysis validated with fragmentation using tandem mass spectrometry to uncover patterns in the molecular features of the dom composition that were not resolved by classification based on stoichiometric ratios in the chemical formulae from upstream to downstream sites beyond the increased aromaticity implied by changes in the stoichiometric ratios we identified an increased abundance of flavonoids and other phenylpropanoids two important subgroups of aromatic compounds the stoichiometric analysis also proposed a localized decline in the abundance of lipid like compounds which we attributed specifically to medium chain and short chain fatty acids other lipids such as long chain fatty acids and sterol lipids remained unchanged we further determined in stream molecular transitions and specific compound degradation by capturing changes in the molecular masses of terpenoids phenylpropanoids fatty acids and amino acids in sum the metabolomics analysis of the chemical formulae resolved molecular variability imprinted on the stoichiometric dom composition to implicate key molecular subgroups underlying carbon transport and cycling dynamics in the

the composition of stream dissolved organic matter dom which is considered to be of terrestrial allochthonous sources from surrounding landscapes or of aquatic autochthonous sources due to in stream metabolic activities can be influenced by biological chemical and physical processes bauer and bianchi 2012 fasching et al 2020 2016 giorgio and pace 2021 lynch et al 2019 stutter et al 2013 tanentzap et al 2019 therefore along a stream path the diversity of dom composition is expected to depend on the source and levels of dom in the headwaters the fresh dom input from the landscape and the extent of dom transformation within the stream creed et al 2015 giorgio and pace 2021 kamjunke et al 2019 lynch et al 2019 singh et al 2014 traditionally the chemical composition and functional properties of natural dom have been inferred using chromophoric and fluorescent properties bhattacharya and osburn 2020 vione et al 2021 yang et al 2015 recent applications of high resolution mass spectrometry hrms based approaches using primarily fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry fticr ms have led to an unprecedented molecular investigation of dom dynamics in terrestrial waters based on the stoichiometric ratio representation of chemical formulae often illustrated by a van krevelen diagram gonsior et al 2011 maizel et al 2017 mcdonough et al 2020 phungsai et al 2016 sleighter and hatcher 2008 valle et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 to date van krevelen analyses have provided valuable information on dom composition dynamics and transformations in aquatic environments pang et al 2021 riedel et al 2016 however the van krevelen diagram used as a classical two dimensional stoichiometry dependent chemical class assignment primarily based on three elements carbon c oxygen o and hydrogen h provides a limited categorization of biomolecules and thus may lead to incorrect classification of molecular classes rivas ubach et al 2018 a recently proposed multidimensional stoichiometric compound msc classification approach rivas ubach et al 2018 which was validated by including six abundant elements c h o nitrogen n phosphorus p and sulfur s enabled the classification of compounds into five groups phytochemicals carbohydrates nucleotides proteins lipids and amino sugars these molecular groups refer to broad classes of biomolecules except that phytochemicals represent a diverse group of keto aromatic biomolecules that could be derived from plants algae and microorganisms despite the diverse molecular profiles of compounds within each stoichiometry based molecular grouping within group molecular variability has not been explored such high resolution molecular information is necessary for the accurate evaluation of the stream dom dynamics and transformation garayburu caruso et al 2020 lynch et al 2019 which is crucial in determining lability persistence metabolism and functional identity of the dom composition cyle et al 2020 lusk and toor 2016 lynch et al 2019 remucal et al 2012 water flow promotes the connectivity of carbon pools between the landscape and aquatic environments and contributes to the flushing of organic matter from riparian areas and soil surfaces into surrounding streams fasching et al 2016 lynch et al 2019 singh et al 2014 the dom export during storm events which can comprise two thirds of the stream dom load annually can introduce rapid changes in the molecular features in the dom composition along the stream path creed et al 2015 oeurng et al 2011 this dom export can result in elevated levels of vascular plant derived organic matter with high molecular complexity and aromaticity from terrestrial sources whereas base flow associated dom may contain a high fraction of protein like and lipid like compounds derived from autochthonous sources lu and liu 2019 moreover increased heteroatom content of the dom observed in the downstream areas including wetlands are often attributed to autochthonous sources due to microbial and algal metabolism fasching et al 2020 fellman et al 2009 beyond broad classification based on chromophoric and fluorescent properties and stoichiometric analysis still lacking is an in depth and high resolution characterization to capture molecular characteristics of spatial and temporal variations of stream dom composition here we seek to obtain this molecular characterization for the stream dom in clear creek iowa a site extensively characterized by the intensively managed landscapes critical zone observatory iml czo project and other studies papanicolau et al 2010 hou et al 2018 kim et al 2020 blair et al 2021 and citations within high resolution time resolved stream sampling was performed at three locations along an approximately 45 km stretch of clear creek immediately prior to and following a spring storm event fig 1 a supplementary fig s1 the upland agricultural portions of the watershed have steeper hillslopes that facilitate connectivity between the erodible surfaces and the channel fig 1a runoff from floodplains and forested riparian buffers which are prevalent downstream intercept agricultural runoff from upstream blair et al 2021 therefore the different landscape features of this watershed provide an appropriate case study to investigate the spatiotemporal dynamics in our molecular investigation of the stream dom composition fig 1a the application of a metabolomics based high resolution chemical fingerprinting of small compounds or metabolites derived from plants and microorganisms is an attractive method to advance a molecular understanding of the source and fate of stream dom lynch et al 2019 fig 1b using high performance liquid chromatography lc coupled with orbitrap based hrms for an untargeted investigation we characterized molecular variabilities in the stream dom composition dynamics using metabolomics based molecular identities and for comparative analysis stoichiometry dependent msc classification fig 1b 2 site description and methods 2 1 site description clear creek a tributary of the iowa river in east central iowa usa drains an approximate 275 km2 watershed blair et al 2021 hou et al 2018 kim et al 2020 the baseflow in this watershed is driven by groundwater and subsurface agricultural drainage or tile drainage which could contribute up to 50 of the streamflow schilling et al 2012 schilling and helmers 2010 soils in the clear creek watershed are silty clay to silt loam mollisols and alfisols with an organic carbon content ranging from 2 wt in agricultural soils to 4 wt in restored prairie soils hou et al 2018 prior to the start of the growing season which begins in early may and continues until early october flash floods can result due to intense storms lack of vegetation cover and fine soil textures hou et al 2018 kim et al 2020 the south amana site captures a predominantly headwater signature from mostly tile drained croplands dominated by corn soybean crop rotations blair et al 2021 land use in the south amana sub basin comprised 86 agricultural 6 developed and 8 natural lands the subtle v shaped cross section of the valley facilitates the transport of hillslope erosion from the fields to the channel by contrast the valley cross section of the downstream sites oxford and coralville is more u or box shaped due to the presence of floodplains the oxford site is downstream of a small town oxford iowa and receives water from a mixture of forest and grass lands 23 though corn and soybean cultivation still dominates 69 papanicolaou et al 2010 the coralville station integrates water from 92 of the clear creek watershed comprising 60 agricultural and 28 natural lands urban land use which is low 11 is localized in the downstream portion of the coralville sub basin the three sampling sites along clear creek capture dom export from the upper sub basin south amana middle sub basin oxford and lower sub basin coralville locations fig 1a the drainage area for these three sites is 26 2 157 5 and 254 3 km2 respectively blair et al 2021 the geomorphology of this river corridor has been implicated in the temporal within a storm event and spatial downstream transport responses of particulate organic carbon poc in previous studies blair et al 2021 kim et al 2020 water discharge at south amana was determined using a stage discharge relationship as previously detailed blair et al 2021 discharge for oxford and coralville were obtained from the usgs website https waterdata usgs gov ia nwis gaging stations 05454200 and 05454300 respectively 2 2 sample collection a total of 63 stream water samples were acquired from the three sampling locations at 2 to 4 h intervals over a near 48 h period to cover shortly before and during a spring storm event march 29th to march 31st 2017 in coordination with the iml czo kim et al 2020 for each sample 800 ml of stream water was collected using isco autosamplers teledyne isco with 1 l nalgene bottles after triple rinsing the sampling line with stream water after collection the samples were filtered through pre combusted fiber filters 0 7 µm pore size millipore and were kept frozen until further analysis the hourly precipitation data for nearby iowa city from the iowa state environmental mesonet website https mesonet agron iastate edu showed that a total of 32 5 mm of rainfall occurred during the study period 2 3 dissolved organic carbon doc and metabolomics based analyses first using an apollo 9000 toc combustion analyzer teledyne tekmar co we quantified the doc concentration at each

camera package in r kuhl et al 2012 following deduction of chloride ion adducts and isotopic daughter ions the spectral features were further refined by applying blank subtraction min signal blank ratio 5 and identifying peaks in technical duplicates using an in house code in r programming environment venables et al 2020 to annotate chemical formulae the omicscraft online database http tools omicscraft com metaboquest was used to search the m z against different compound databases pubchem hmdb lipid maps kegg and mmcd with the mass tolerance of 20 ppm the majority of annotated chemical formulae 75 had a mass error of 10 ppm first the annotated chemical formulae were categorized using the stoichiometry dependent msc classification approach which considers the heteroatom content of biomolecules c h o n p s and four different stoichiometric ratios o c h c n c p c to classify compounds as carbohydrate like carbohydrates and amino sugars lipid like nucleotide like phytochemicals or protein like rivas ubach et al 2018 second the annotated chemical formulae were subjected to metabolomics based classification by cross referencing the returned results with kegg brite hierarchy files https www kegg jp using an r code followed by manually scrutinizing each group for accuracy for simplicity of presentation the metabolites were grouped into 14 categories flavonoids phenylpropanoids terpenoids alkaloids polyketides glycosides fatty acids other lipids e g fatty acyls and sterol lipids carbohydrates amino acids including dipeptides carboxylic acids nucleotides and their associated derivatives nucleotides nucleosides and nucleobases other secondary metabolites betalains natural toxins vitamins cofactors hormones and transmitters and multiclass isomers chemical formulae with multiple entries in the kegg database regarding their functional categorization we employed collision induced ms ms or tandem ms analysis to obtain fragmentation patterns to resolve uncertainties in determining chemical structures especially when the metabolomics based classification of a compound differed from or was not determined by the msc classification data dependent acquisition top 5 peaks with normalized collision energies of 15 30 and 45 were used on a selected number of samples 4 from each site fragmentation spectra were acquired at resolution 17 500 precursor ions were isolated

f test t test and multivariant analysis and data visualization based on kernel density estimation were performed in jmp statistical discovery from sas institute inc multivariant analysis including principal component analysis pca and redundancy analysis is widely used to connect metrics of dom composition and landscape characteristics bhattacharya and osburn 2020 frost et al 2006 graeber et al 2012 we conducted the pca analysis to evaluate the correlation between the molecular groupings of chemical formulae with respect to the discharge and location along the stream for this analysis to account for the impact of increased flow from upstream to downstream discharge q was normalized by maximum discharge at each site qmax in addition the abundance for each molecular group at each site was normalized by the total number of characterized compounds at each site 3 results 3 1 spatiotemporal dom variations as a function of discharge first we examined changes in the doc levels in response to the storm event at the three site locations fig 1a c at both south amana and coralville there was no clear trend between the discharge and the doc concentrations supplementary fig s2 which varied from 14 9 mg l 1 to 20 9 mg l 1 and from 11 7 mg l 1 to 18 7 mg l 1 respectively fig 1c however at oxford a steady decrease in doc concentration from 36 8 mg l 1 to 13 4 mg l 1 during the storm event reflected a doc dilution at this site which would result from a limited doc input as a function of the increased discharge at this site singh dhillon and inamdar 2014 fig 1c the highest compound diversity was found at the midstream oxford site fig 1d while we annotated 2441 chemical compounds 1810 unique chemical formulae by excluding isomers at oxford we only found a total of 1509 chemical compounds 1192 unique chemical formulae at south amana and 1633 chemical compounds 1361 unique chemical formulae at coralville fig 1d markedly the identification of a relatively small amount 358 of common chemical formulae across all three site locations highlighted the spatial variation in the dom chemical composition in clear creek implying a fast turnover of the dom consistent with the lack of increasing doc concentration during the storm fig 1d at south amana there was a small temporal variability in the number of compounds from 1007 to 1089 from the start to the end of the study period with 41 of the compounds consistently present at all samples across the sampling time fig 1e supplementary fig s3 at oxford the dynamic appearance and disappearance of compounds at each subsequent sampling time resulted in an overall 50 decrease in the number of distinct compounds by the end of the sampling period fig 1e at coralville these dynamic changes led to an overall 15 decrease in the number of identified compounds by the end of the storm fig 1e therefore relatively greater temporal variations at oxford and coralville relative to south amana during the storm implied the influence of different dom source contributions or dom transformations at the different sites supplementary fig s3 to obtain further insights into changes in the molecular identities of the compounds we first evaluated changes in the dom stoichiometry fig 2 3 2 dom stoichiometry implies dynamics in molecular diversity most annotated compounds 80 had o c ratios 0 5 which have been attributed previously to lipids proteins and lignin derived compounds fig 2a d andrilli et al 2013 lu et al 2015 rivas ubach et al 2018 while the oxford site had the most o containing compounds consistent with its high compound diversity the average o c ratio 0 42 was the greatest at coralville highlighting the presence of relatively more oxidized compounds at the downstream location fig 2a supplementary fig s5 at the beginning of the storm compounds had well distributed h c between 1 and 2 1 at all three sites indicating the presence of diverse compounds in the stream before the rise of the discharge as was also reported for poc fig 2a rivas ubach et al 2018 approximately 20 of unsaturated compounds with high aromaticity and fewer alkyl groups h c 1 3 disappeared by the peak of the flow and those with h c 1 3 persisted at south amana and at oxford fig 2a during the receding limb of the hydrograph at oxford when the influence of subsurface interflow would be more pronounced than at the rising limb compounds with relatively higher h c ratios 1 5 h c 2 became predominant fig 2a at the downstream location coralville the average h c ratio 1 27 of the compounds was lower than the two upstream sites average h c 1 37 p 0 05 fig 2a supplementary fig s4 indicating a shift to unsaturated compounds both with fewer alkyl groups and with increased aromaticity downstream the proportion of n containing chemical formulae 44 49 was relatively higher than reported previously in terrestrial lakes 12 32 gonsior et al 2011 maizel et al 2017 lake sediments 21 34 zhang et al 2018 and the ocean up to 10 sleighter and hatcher 2008 supplementary fig s5 at south amana and oxford the n c values of the compounds remained relatively constant 0 n c 0 5 during the sampling period but the peak discharge at coralville revealed the transport of compounds with higher n c values fig 2a coralville had the highest average n c value 0 26 among the three sites p 0 001 supplementary fig s4 a small percentage 6 8 of the compounds had p in their chemical composition fig 2a rivas ubach et al 2018 the p c ratio in most of these compounds remained the same at about p c 0 1 but the density of p containing compounds with this p c ratio increased downstream over the sampling period fig 2a most detected s containing compounds had one s atom in their chemical composition at all three sites before and after the storm stressing the persisting presence of mono thiolated compounds such as cysteine and glutathione or the presence of sulfonated compounds widely detected in natural waters chu et al 2016 low abundance of di sulfated compounds with two s which could include cystine a cysteine dimer was also detected fig 2a instead of the widely used van krevelen plots whose compound classification is based on the atomic ratios of h c versus o c supplementary fig s6 we analyzed the abundance of compounds in relation to the atomic ratios of o c h c n c and p c present in the chemical formulae using the msc classification to obtain five stoichiometry based groupings of the annotated compounds fig 1b rivas ubach et al 2018 the majority of the compounds across the three sites were classified as phytochemical like 28 34 and lipid like 22 31 compounds whereby the percentage of phytochemical like compounds increased from upstream to downstream accompanied by a decrease in the proportion of more labile lipid like compounds fig 2b and supplemental table s1 consistent with previous reports of preferential degradation of lipid like compounds ladd et al 2021 protein like compounds comprised 12 13 of the annotated compounds fig 2b carbohydrate like 2 4 and nucleotide like 1 compounds comprised a small fraction of the classified compounds fig 2b regarding the phytochemical like compounds they were clustered primarily at two ranges of m z of 200 and at 350 at south amana but at oxford these compounds had a well distributed m z during the rising limb of the hydrograph and at coralville phytochemical like compounds with lower m z were less abundant fig 2c at the beginning of the sampling period at all three sites there were well distributed m z values 200 400 of lipid like compounds fig 2c as discharge increased at south amana the abundance of low molecular mass lipid like compounds m z 300 diminished fig 2c by contrast at oxford the lipid like compounds with a wide range of m z values declined steadily during the storm fig 2c supplementary fig s7 and at coralville the lipid like compounds had relatively constant m z values during the study period but there was a surge in lipid like compounds with 200 m z 400 after the early flush first 30 h fig 2c for protein like compounds the range of the m z values at south amana decreased at the crest of the hydrograph when the abundance of compounds with m z 300 declined but at coralville these compounds appeared after the early flush implying their upstream to downstream transport fig 2c the majority of carbohydrate like and nucleotide like compounds had a relatively constant abundance and m z 150 200 m z for carbohydrate like compounds and 350 m z for nucleotide like compounds along the stream and during the study period fig 2c supplementary fig s7 in sum the stoichiometry based data analysis implied from upstream to downstream sites an enrichment in aromatic plant derived compounds and a preferential decomposition of lipid like compounds which were reported previously to be bioreactive ladd et al 2021 lu et al 2015 3 3 high resolution metabolomics based molecular characterization with fragmentation validation to capture variability in the molecular level composition of the aforementioned broad stoichiometry based classification of the dom dynamics we subjected the lc hrms data to a metabolomics based analysis scheme for the identification of specific compounds or derivatives from plant and microbial metabolism figs 1b and 3 the compound identities based on the metabolomics based analysis 13 of the total unique chemical formulae were classified into the following 14 molecular groupings of metabolites with functional roles in metabolism carboxylic acids amino acids including dipeptides carbohydrates including monosaccharides disaccharides and amino sugars flavonoids terpenoids alkaloids other phenylpropanoids glycosides polyketides fatty acids other lipids nucleotides and their derivatives multiclass isomers and other secondary metabolites fig 3 towards validating our metabolomics based molecular grouping we also performed ms ms fragmentation analysis to obtain molecular fragments determinants of specific molecular functional classes particularly for compounds that were categorized differently by the msc classification fig 3a for instance tyrosine an aromatic amino acid which was considered a phytochemical like compound by the broad msc classification was classified correctly as an amino acid by the metabolomics based protocol through the identification of the carboxyl amino moiety m z 72 0077 fig 3a guanosine correctly binned as a nucleotide derivative through metabolomics based assignment via the guanine fragment m z 150 0414 was classified incorrectly as a protein like compound by msc classification fig 3a several glycosides which generate a sugar fragment and at times contained lipid components were categorized broadly as carbohydrate like or lipid like by the stoichiometry based analysis fig 3a and 3 for example 8 epideoxyloganic acid is a terpene glycoside or an iridoid glycoside which contains both lipid and sugar moieties but it was annotated as lipid like compound by the msc approach fig 3a importantly our metabolomics based scheme identified carboxylic acids which were among the uncategorized compounds or incorrectly annotated as carbohydrate like compounds under the msc classification fig 3a and b for all the cross categorized chemical formulae the agreement between the msc and metabolomics based classifications varied between 44 and 100 fig 3b we found that 100 of the chemical formulae categorized as nucleotide like compounds by the msc classification were assigned as nucleotides or nucleotide derivatives by the metabolomics assisted approach fig 3b moreover based on the metabolomics based classification 71 of the compounds classified as carbohydrate like were found to be carbohydrates fig 3b however among those compounds broadly grouped as protein like by msc classification the metabolomics based assignment determined that 44 of them belonged to amino acids and dipeptides furthermore due to stoichiometric similarities with small peptides as n containing compounds the msc approach categorized nucleotides as protein like compounds but they were assigned accurately as nucleotides or nucleotide derivatives by the metabolomics analysis we note however that proteins and large peptides were not characterized by the metabolomics based approach fig 3b a large fraction 79 of phytochemical like compounds was assigned to compounds generally attributed to plant derived compounds such as flavonoids alkaloids and phenylpropanoids a small fraction 5 was annotated as other secondary metabolites such as betalains fig 3b still there are important groups of plant derived compounds including alkaloids and terpenoids which were not categorized by the msc approach but were captured by the metabolomics analysis fig 3b furthermore a diverse group of metabolomics identified compounds including carboxylic acids e g hydroxybutyric acid fig 3a short chain fatty acids nucleotides and their derivatives remained uncategorized by the msc approach fig 3b in sum these aforementioned differences in the compound categorizations by the metabolomics based approach highlight the broad mis categorization or lack of categorization by the msc approach fig 3b therefore the metabolomics based assignments offered additional and detailed molecular insights into the stream dom dynamics beyond the molecular features proposed by the msc classification fig 3b these new insights afforded a new picture of the molecular variability in the stream dom as discussed in the following section 3 4 metabolomics based analysis of spatial and temporal molecular variability in stream dom here we present the insights into the spatiotemporal molecular transitions resulting from the metabolomics based analysis in relation to the dynamic changes in the broad molecular classes deduced from the stoichiometric patterns of the dom we analyzed the abundances of the metabolomics based group of metabolites associated with each molecular class as well as within group dynamics of the metabolites by monitoring changes in m z along the steam fig 4 supplementary figs s7 and s8 at south amana during the rising limb of the hydrograph we found that an initial increase from 316 to 409 and subsequent decrease to 362 in the abundance of lipid like compounds coincided with increased abundance of fatty acids and other lipids at this site supplementary figs s7 and s8 at oxford among the decreased abundance observed for a diverse group of compounds during the storm lipid like compounds had the sharpest decline from 577 to 282 supplementary fig s7 the metabolomics based analysis determined that this decline was attributed primarily to a decrease in the number of fatty acids from 99 to 16 at oxford while there were minimal changes in the abundance of other lipids predominantly fatty acyls and sterol lipids during the storm event supplementary fig s8 at coralville the abundance of different compounds changed dynamically during the early flush of the storm event supplementary fig s8 for instance the number of identified fatty acids fluctuated between 9 and 35 during this period or between 8 and 32 for nucleotides and associated derivatives supplementary fig s8 analysis of within group dynamics of the metabolites revealed that medium chain fatty acids c16 c18 m z 250 were the most abundant at south amana but short chain fatty acids appeared at oxford and coralville fig 4a moreover the abundance of other lipids with m z of 300 350 corresponding to sterol lipids remained the same across all three sites furthermore in accordance with increased abundance from 296 to 372 of phytochemical like or keto aromatic compounds during the rising limb of the hydrograph followed by a decline during the falling limb to 330 the metabolomics based analysis revealed a corresponding pattern for the flavonoids supplementary fig s7 and s8 specifically a shift from high molecular weight compounds 400 m z 500 to the low molecular weight compounds 250 m z 350 in the abundance of flavonoids was reminiscent of the breakdown of the glycosylic bond facilitated by glycosyl hydrolases or related enzymes commonly found in streams hill et al 2010 santos et al 2019 such breakdown pattern was also manifested in the disappearance of other glycosides with high m z 400 m z 450 at coralville fig 4 in addition a shift in m z values was also observed for other phenylpropanoids from 300 m z 400 to 200 m z 300 fig 4 furthermore a decreased abundance of low molecular weight terpenoids m z 250 downstream also reflected the degradation in the terpenoid group of compounds fig 4 in contrast the consistent occurrence of similar m z values for both amino acids and carboxylic acids at all three sites reflected the ubiquity of these compounds in natural waters fig 4 mostofa et al 2013 to explore further the spatiotemporal molecular variations in the dom dynamics we performed principal component analysis pca to evaluate variation in the normalized abundance of chemical formulae in each molecular grouping using either msc classification or metabolomics based analysis with respect to the different sites the falling and rising limb of the storm hydrograph the doc concentration and the normalized discharge fig 5 for msc classification the first principal component pc1 explained 55 variations in the abundance of annotated compounds fig 5 this component positively corresponded with phytochemical like 33 loading nucleotide like 28 loading protein like 3 2 loading and carbohydrate like 0 5 loading compounds and negatively corresponded with lipid like compounds 34 loading fig 5 the second principal component pc2 explained 27 of the variations and largely corresponded with protein like 43 loading carbohydrate like 54 loading and lipid like 1 6 loading compounds fig 5 for compounds classified by the metabolomics based approach the pc1 and pc2 together explained 58 6 of the variation fig 5 the pc1 was positively associated with flavonoids 15 loading other phenylpropanoids 14 loading and polyketides comprised of mono and polycyclic aromatics 7 loading and negatively corresponded with fatty acids 7 2 loading other lipids 14 loading fig 5 the pc2 was positively associated with fatty acids 9 loading and other lipids 1 loading fig 5 notably for both msc and metabolomics based classifications the pc1 distinguished coralville the downstream site from the other two upstream sites and the pc2 separated south amana and oxford the upstream sites both the flow stage i e rising and falling limb of hydrograph and discharge played a small role in explaining the variability of the abundance of molecules while doc levels correlated negatively with pc1 fig 5 therefore for the compounds classified by either msc or metabolomics based classification approaches the pca revealed a divergence in the molecular composition of the doc from upstream to downstream sites and highlighted a greater impact of spatial location compared to storm hydrograph in maintaining this divergence fig 5 firstly the pca of compounds categorized by the msc classification confirmed a transition from a high abundance of lipid like compounds at south amana to an enrichment of phytochemical like or keto aromatic compounds at coralville fig 5 these changes in the molecular patterns of the dom could implicate different spatiotemporal contributions of dom inputs or different transport of the dom along the stream providing high resolution molecular insights on the identities of the phytochemical like compounds associated with coralville the pca of the metabolomics based classification of compounds correlated flavonoids phenylpropanoids and both mono and polycyclic aromatics with this downstream location demonstrating a molecular signature of plant derived compounds sourced from the different agricultural and forested areas in the watershed fig 5 secondly the abundance of n containing metabolites amino acids nucleotides and derivatives correlated positively with both pc1 6 loading and pc2 3 loading consistent with a low percentage of n containing compounds at oxford fig 5 supplementary fig s5 thirdly glycosides and carbohydrates negatively corresponded with pc1 and pc2 fig 5 fourthly the pca of the metabolites depicted the consistent presence of carboxylic acids at all three sites in the stream fig 5 characterized by a weak correlation with pc1 2 loading and no correlation with pc2 fig 5 taken collectively the statistical analysis of our data identified the sampling location as the primary determinant of dom variability in relation to the change in landscape features and in stream processes at each location 4 discussion elucidating temporal and spatial changes in the dom composition of streams and rivers is critical to unraveling the role of this dom in the cycling and transport fluxes of carbon in a watershed towards deciphering the chemical diversity of aquatic dom underlying these fluxes has been the application of high resolution mass spectrometry to annotate chemical formulae d andrilli et al 2013 gonsior et al 2011 lu et al 2015 maizel et al 2017 sleighter and hatcher 2008 zhang et al 2018 these chemical formulae are typically analyzed based on stoichiometric ratio relationships to determine their classification with respect to broad molecular categories thereby resulting in low resolution elucidation of the molecular patterns in dom composition capturing high resolution molecular patterns is especially important in streams and rivers wherein dom composition is highly dynamic due to beyond the dom sourcing from the surrounding landscape and in stream biotic and abiotic processes hydrologic events that control the load and residence of dom spatially and temporally battin et al 2009 bauer and bianchi 2012 creed et al 2015 fasching et al 2020 2016 fellman et al 2009 giorgio and pace 2021 lu and liu 2019 lynch et al 2019 oeurng et al 2011 singh et al 2014 tanentzap et al 2019 here to advance high resolution molecular characterization of stream dom dynamics we performed a metabolomics based analysis of dom from high frequency sampling at three different sites on a small stream through a storm event the measured doc concentrations at clear creek were within the doc range observed in streams and agricultural effluents dhillon and inamdar 2013 hassanpour et al 2017 wise et al 2020 importantly our metabolomics based analysis captured different patterns in the molecular composition of the stream dom at the different sites which shed light on the spatiotemporal dynamics of dom cycling and transport beyond what could be achieved solely based on a stoichiometric based analysis indeed stoichiometry of chemical formulae can provide valuable preliminary insights into the dom dynamics in the stream with respect to the extent of oxidation aromaticity and heteroatom content roth et al 2019 increased heteroatom content of compounds in the downstream location has been previously attributed mainly to autochthonous production d andrilli et al 2013 maizel et al 2017 rivas ubach et al 2018 here our data depicted a time dependent heteroatom content related to discharge during the storm event thus illustrating an association between dom transport and dynamics in heteroatom composition that could be due to transport of diverse dom derived from both allochthonous and autochthonous production in the stream in lieu of the widely used van krevelen plots which may result in inaccurate assignments of biomolecules solely based on the atomic ratios of h c versus o c lu et al 2015 rivas ubach et al 2018 we employed the msc classification to analyze the abundance of compounds in relation to multiple atomic ratios of o c h c n c and p c present in the chemical formulae rivas ubach et al 2018 in sum from upstream to downstream sites the stoichiometry based analysis highlighted an enrichment in phytochemical like compounds broadly representing keto aromatic compounds and depletion of lipid like and protein like compounds the greater abundance of lipid like and protein like compounds at the upstream site could be attributed to greater slope upstream to result in greater contribution of groundwater from soil profiles frost et al 2006 enriched in compounds of microbial origins and relatively depleted in plant derived compounds kaiser and kalbitz 2012 roth et al 2019 due to lower mobility of these compounds adsorbed to soil particles mcdonough et al 2020 moreover the metabolomics based analysis revealed that the increased abundance of keto aromatic moieties of relatively lower molecular weights was due to the breakdown of flavonoids and other phenylpropanoids fig 6 which are components of tannins commonly found in stream dom leenheer and rostad 2004 lu and liu 2019 decreasing molecular weight and increasing aromaticity in the outlet of watersheds were previously connected to photo and microbial degradation lambert et al 2015 and low molecular weight organic compounds were observed previously to tend to be susceptible to degradation hodgkins et al 2016 roth et al 2019 valle et al 2020 furthermore we determined that spatial changes in the abundance of lipid like compounds were due to localized depletion or enrichment of short chain and medium chain fatty acids at each site whereas sterol lipids remained unchanged throughout fig 6 we also captured persistence of small amino acids in all three sites disappearance of selected carboxylic acids at the downstream site and breakdown of glycosides at the downstream sites fig 6 glycosides are seldom detected in natural water samples partly due to organic matter extraction methods that hydrolyze the glycosidic bond but the presence of glycosides in water has ecosystem implications due to their antimicrobial characteristics hawkes et al 2018 merder et al 2021 short chain carboxylic acids c 6 which are not specifically characterized by stoichiometric ratio relationships despite being a common component of natural organic matter adeleke et al 2017 aristilde et al 2017a are ubiquitous in stream waters as they have high turnover rates küsel and drake 1998 and can be produced both biotically or abiotically by photo oxidation hassanpour and aristilde 2021 moran and zepp 1997 in headwaters of large watersheds increased discharge has been reported to promote better connections between river channels thus leading to a convergent dom composition with greater similarities due to a greater mixing and availability of nutrients lynch et al 2019 along a stream the river continuum concept vannote et al 1980 suggests a continual decrease in the molecular diversity of dom although this shift can be influenced by landscape features and anthropogenic activities creed et al 2015 kamjunke et al 2019 especially in small streams here in clear creek site specific inputs from natural areas and tributaries contributed to the increased molecular diversity and doc concentrations from the upstream site south amana to midstream site oxford however an inverse association between doc and the downstream site coralville fig 5 presumably due to both the contribution of a larger area of the watershed and increased retention time at this downstream site in addition to the immediate urban areas surrounding this site frost et al 2006 temporal changes of dom composition based on our untargeted metabolomics based analysis at the upstream location of south amana were similar to those reported for the poc using targeted analysis of biomarker compounds blair et al 2021 kim et al 2020 the input sequence of poc into clear creek was identified to be fatty acids due to in channel sources dominated by algae lignin phenols from surface soils from row crop fields and finally a complex mixture of upstream sources that became increasingly dominated by channel bank erosional material with transport downstream blair et al 2021 kim et al 2020 at the downstream locations oxford and coralville however the patterns of doc and poc differed facilitated transport of doc as a result of the storm flow was not observed at the oxford site contrasting the observation that poc at clear creek was mobilized during storm events due increased sediment erosion kim et al 2020 specifically in lieu of the reported significant mobilization of poc by erosive forces singh dhillon and inamdar 2014 the decrease in compound diversity along with the dilution of the doc concentration at the oxford site indicated the lack of sufficient increase in new doc inputs during the increased runoff albeit differences between poc and doc trends may be season dependent we acknowledge that our metabolomics based approach was focused on small molecules m z 840 and comprehensive classification of the annotated chemical formulae is currently not possible due to compound coverage limitation in existing metabolomics databases nevertheless the metabolomics based analysis presented here spanned a wide variety of compounds belonging to a diverse array of molecular subgroups that are relevant and significant in environmental samples 5 conclusion an important component of carbon cycling in a watershed is the fate of dom in streams and rivers the advent of high resolution mass spectrometry based techniques has advanced molecular understanding of the chemical diversity of aquatic dom however stoichiometry focused analysis of chemical formulae has led to a limited understanding of the dynamic changes in the dom composition due to low resolution molecular classification here we employed a metabolomics based approach to achieve high resolution fingerprinting of molecular derivatives of plant and microbial metabolism we obtained spatiotemporal molecular insights into the dom composition of a stream traversing different landscape types interestingly using either the stoichiometry based or the metabolomics based classification statistical data analysis attributed the dynamic change in the molecular classes or groupings at each site in the stream to carbon flux from the surrounding landscapes combined with in stream transformations while the flow stage and the increased discharge played a limited role however the metabolomics based analysis afforded high resolution evaluation of the spatial divergence in the molecular identities of the compounds which was not resolved by the stoichiometric analysis for instance increased abundance of phytochemical like compounds was due to the dynamics of specific molecular subgroups captured by metabolomics based analysis involving increased abundance of polyketides flavonoids and other phenylpropanoids from upstream to downstream through several illustrations of the spatiotemporal molecular variations of the dom composition in the clear creek corridor we demonstrate here that metabolomics based analysis can offer additional molecular insights consistent with or unresolved by stoichiometric classification thus the application of such metabolomics based analysis combined with stoichiometric based categorization can advance our molecular understanding of the fate of carbon in aquatic environments a critical
