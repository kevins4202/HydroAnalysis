18185,the knowledge about membrane biofouling evolution in full scale membrane bioreactor mbr applications is quite lacking notwithstanding a few lab scale investigations for the first time this study elaborated the effect of online naocl cleaning on the dynamic development of membrane biofilm microbiota during long term operation of a large scale mbr for municipal wastewater treatment 40 000 m3 d four times of membrane autopsies were conducted during 160 days operation to scrutinize the microbial community and concomitant organic foulants the transmembrane pressure difference tmp development revealed limited effect of 30 min online naocl cleaning on long term biofouling removal naocl not only altered the structure of biofilm communities but also increased the richness and evenness on early fouling stages meanwhile network analysis revealed the keystone taxa f comamonadaceae that played key roles in stabilizing community structure and developing anti cleaning and irreversible fouling propensity of the biofilm naocl cleaning also impacted the evolving of keystone taxa by intensifying the competition between the dominated taxa f moraxellaceae and other species during early fouling stages furthermore the succession of the biofilm microbiota synchronously accelerated the tmp increase and the accumulation of organic foulants including polysaccharides aromatic proteins and soluble microbial products during biofilm maturation these identified key stubborn foulants shed light on limitations of current online naocl cleaning and provide guidance to optimize the efficiency of online chemical cleaning protocols in full scale mbr operations graphical abstract image 1 keywords membrane fouling full scale mbr online naocl cleaning network analysis keystone taxa 1 introduction membrane bioreactor mbr combines the advantages of high effluent quality and complete biomass retention without a secondary sedimentation tank and has been achieving considerable market currently xiao et al 2019a 2019b although massive research and development have been made for mbrs during the last decades membrane fouling remains the major operational obstacle to the broadening applications worldwide membrane cleaning is essential to mitigate fouling development especially enhancing online naocl cleaning efficiency in full scale mbrs is vital in light of the cost effectiveness and efficiency of maintaining membrane performance though a number of lab and pilot scale researches have demonstrated the effectiveness of naocl in foulants removal wang et al 2018 zhou et al 2017 a growing concern is that some of the microorganisms are chemically tolerant and difficult to remove by the cleaning leading to irreversible biofouling navarro et al 2016 found that microorganisms related to halotolerance thermophilic and acid resistant strains could survive from 30 min naocl backwash sun et al 2016 found that flavobacteriaceae and saprospiraceae became the predominant bacteria in the membrane biofilm after online chemical cleaning whereas zhang et al 2017 found that the bacillus was more prone to proliferate in the membrane pores after frequent naocl cleaning these research revealed different anti cleaning microorganisms in lab and pilot researches which however can hardly represent the real culprit of biofouling in the practical application due to the diversity of microorganisms of wastewater source jo et al 2016 matar et al 2017 furthermore it has been underlined that the dynamic formation of membrane biofilm community can be affected by operating conditions takada et al 2018 and that naocl cleaning could play a key role in shaping competitive microbial communities during repeated fouling and cleaning in full scale mbrs however in depth analysis of the dynamic response of biofilm microorganisms towards online naocl cleaning in full scale mbrs is quite lacking for example the initial biofilm diversity due to regrowth of residual microorganisms on the cleaned membrane has not been explored therefore it is critical to track how the microbes grow and evolve on the membrane surface under the stress of periodic chemical cleaning in a long term run it is well accepted that the diversity of microbial population and the changeable characteristics of eps e g structure of polysaccharides and proteins are critical problems for biofouling control therefore identifying the anti cleaning keystone taxa in biofilms and their roles in dynamic biofouling can provide in depth understanding of the real culprit of biofouling in the practical application thus this study aims to answer the following critical questions a how does the biofilm community respond to online naocl cleaning e g community structure and alpha diversity from early to mature fouling stages b does the biofilm community harbor keystone taxa that are resistant to online cleaning and can govern the dynamic evolution of community structure and membrane fouling c what is the feature of concomitant organic foulants that can synergize with the stubborn microorganisms during the overall fouling development to address the above issues high throughput sequencing combined with network analysis methods can be an effective tool to reveal the co occurrence pattern and interpret the ecological structure and function of microbial community deng et al 2012 2016 xu et al 2019 real time tracking biofilm community in response to naocl cleaning would help to identify keystone population and species responsible for fouling and anti cleaning in full scale mbr systems meanwhile concerning biofouling in full scale mbrs observing and verifying membrane biofilm community in relation to biofouling development are very important especially in the actual long term operation mbr systems no matter that a few similar pilot scale researches have been conducted sun et al 2016 to our knowledge this might be the first study aimed at deciphering the anti cleaning keystone taxa during long term operation of a full scale mbr for municipal wastewater treatment and revealing its correlation with organic foulants this research can be instructive for improving design of online chemical cleaning protocols involving for instance chemical agents cleaning intensity and timing that are oriented to full scale mbr applications 2 material and methods 2 1 the full scale mbr and sample collection the anaerobic anoxic aerobic membrane bioreactor aao mbr system with a capability of 40000 m3 d for domestic wastewater treatment and reclamation is located in beijing china the experiment employed a new membrane module beijing origin water technology co ltd china as the research subject a pvdf hollow fiber membrane with a nominal pore size of 0 1 μm and a total membrane area of 16800 m2 was installed in the membrane tank the characteristics of the raw wastewater are shown in table s1 the transmembrane pressure tmp was monitored by an online pressure gauge online chemical cleaning was carried out about twice per month depending on the tmp level with 300 ppm naocl ph 12 to backflush the membrane for 30 min membrane samples were collected from the module which was operated from 3 july to 12 december 160 days of the same year membrane samples before termed as bm and after online cleaning termed as am were collected on day 37 64 124 and 160 before cleaning triplicate hollow fiber membrane samples were cut with a length of 1 5 m using a sterile steel knife from three different locations on the fouled membrane module the same procedure was conducted after the membrane was cleaned and the filtration had been resumed for 10 min membrane samples were then sealed in an aseptic self sealing bag containing ultrapure water immersed absorbent cotton the bulk sludge samples 50 ml each were collected with sterilized centrifuge tubes before membrane biofilm samples were collected all samples were quickly returned to the laboratory and stored at 80 c until further analysis 2 2 membrane surface physiochemical characterization the surface morphology of the fouled membranes was examined using a zeiss field emission scanning electron microscope sem zeiss merlin compact germany at 15 0 kv confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm was performed to characterize the residual microbial cells and extracellular polymeric substances eps on cleaned membrane surfaces fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc concanavalin a calcofluor white and syto 63 were applied to stain protein α polysaccharide β polysaccharide and cells respectively the stained membranes were frozen at 20 c and sectioned into specimens 100 μm thick using a cryomicrotome leica cm 1950 germany the details of the staining method and clsm imaging were described in a previous report chen et al 2006 after pretreatment the cross sections of hollow fiber membrane were imaged with a confocal laser scanning microscope zeiss lsm 780 carl zeiss micro imaging gmbh germany a zen software zeiss germany was used to process the raw clsm images 2 3 microbial community analysis prior to dna extraction the membrane surfaces were rinsed with 1 pbs solarbio to remove loosely deposited sludge huang et al 2008 and six parallel membrane samples length 1 cm were cut into small pieces using sterilized scissors the samples of membranes and bulk sludge were subjected to dna extraction using a powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc carlsbad ca following the manufacturer s instructions extraction yield and purity were assessed using a nanodrop nd 1000 spectrophotometer ctrophotometer thermo fisher scientific waltham ma the v4 region of the 16s rrna genes was amplified using 515f 806r primers and cycling 30 cycles 94 c 30 s 52 c 30 s 72 c 30 s and then 10 min at 72 c after an initial denaturation of 5 min at 94 c biorad s1000 bio rad laboratory ca polymerase chain reactions pcr were performed in duplicate amplicons containing error correcting barcode sequences were pooled visualized on an agarose gel and quantified using genetools software syngene cambridge uk equimolar amounts from all amplicons were pooled together into a single composite sample and purified using an ezna gel extraction kit omega usa before illumina hiseq2000 sequencing at magigene guangzhou china operational taxonomic units otus were identified using the uparse function within usearch edgar 2010 poor quality reads and chimeric sequences where a single organism comprises genetically distinct cells were removed using usearch default settings otus were classified using the ribosomal database project rdp database the sequencing reads were deposited into the sequence read archive sra of the national center for biotechnology information ncbi under study accession number sub5375325 for alpha diversity measurements both non phylogeny based metrics observed otus shannon diversity index h and chao 1 richness estimator and phylogeny based metric phylogenetic diversity pd whole tree were calculated using the program qiime phyla with significant differences among microbial community samples were chosen as biomarkers using the kruskal wallis test p 0 01 analysis of similarities anosim was applied to show the differences of microbial communities between the groups using the vegan and permute packages within the r environment similarity percentage simper analysis was conducted with the vegan package to identify the major taxonomy under class level responsible for the differences observed between the biofilm samples before and after chemical cleaning other statistical analyses for microbial communities were implemented using relevant r packages the beta diversity was analyzed based on weighted unifrac distance calculating the total otus chang et al 2011 and visualized by non metric multi dimensional scaling nmds using omicshare tools http www omicshare com tools 2 4 network construction using the rmt based approach the phylogenetic molecular ecological networks pmens were constructed on a comprehensive molecular ecological network analysis pipeline http ieg2 ou edu mena in brief the relative abundance of otu numbers was used to obtain the correlation matrices which were then converted into similarity matrices each network was separated into modules by fast greedy modularity in addition for network comparison corresponding random networks of both pmens were generated using the maslov sneppen method maslov and sneppen 2002 and keeping the numbers of nodes and edges constant but rewiring all of the edge positions in the pmens then a standard z test was applied to determine the significance between the pmens and their corresponding random networks the r square of power law 0 8 and modularity 0 4 were used to identify small world property and modular structure of the networks telesford et al 2011 gephi webatlas paris france was used for network visualization and modular analysis bastian et al 2009 2 5 membrane residual organic foulants analysis the residual organic foulants from am samples were extracted using naoh 0 01 mol l kimura et al 2009 briefly membrane surface was wiped with a sponge and rinsed with sterile water to remove loosely bounded foulants before being cutting into pieces then the membrane samples were soaked in naoh for 24 h at 20 c the foulants were quantified as the concentrations of polysaccharide ps protein pn and humic acid ha expressed as glucose bovine serum protein and humic acid equivalents respectively the residual organic foulants were further characterized using three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix 3d eem spectroscopy f 4500 hitachi tokyo japan the intensities and locations of the eem peaks were identified according to the method of xiao et al 2018a 3 results 3 1 overall fouling development fig 1 shows the tmp development during 160 days of operation 3rd july 12th december on stage i from 1 to 60 days the tmp increasing was slow and the occasional cleaning procedure was efficient to maintain membrane performance less stable membrane performance was observed on stage ii from 61 to 90 days it is worth mentioning that the low tmp at the beginning of september was caused by operational disruption due to the influent shortage thereafter the tmp increased to 27 kpa by 26th september and dropped back to 20 kpa after cleaning on stage iii from 91 to 124 days the tmp sharply increased from 30 to 50 kpa although it recovered by 37 after chemical cleaning on day 124 fig 1c the tmp drop after day 124 was caused by the 50 cut down of treatment capacity and shortened filtration cycle due to the start up of a new mbr plant nearby 3 2 alpha and beta diversity of microbial communities the 16s sequencing generated a total of 2 379 401 high quality reads from 12 bulk sludge samples and 48 membrane biofilm samples before and after online chemical cleaning the sequences were clustered into 152 715 otus at a 97 sequence identity threshold analysis of similarity anosim showed significant inter group differences p 0 001 r 0 803 for am p 0 001 r 0 96 for bm fig s2 wilcoxon signed rank test showed significant difference p 0 01 between bm and am samples overall fig s3 the alpha diversity showed that the richness index of chao 1 and evenness index of shannon were significantly increased after the online chemical cleaning on days 37 and 64 p 0 05 fig 2 the observed species and pd whole tree also showed significant higher species richness of the biofilm microbiota after the online chemical cleaning on day 37 d p 0 05 however with the extension of operation time days 124 and 160 neither richness nor evenness of species displayed significant variation after the cleaning overall the diversity indices for richness and evenness to a certain extent revealed the characteristics of bacterial communities and formation of biofilm adapting to online naocl cleaning the beta diversity of bacterial communities between membrane biofilm and suspended sludge was compared based on weighted uni frac distance and visualized by nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds fig 3 the results show that based on phylogeny bulk sludge samples were highly dissimilar from membrane biofilm samples and early biofilms were dissimilar to mature biofilms additionally the abundance and phylogenetic distance of early biofilms significantly changed after cleaning indicating that the initial biofilm microbiota were more susceptible to the oxidative and also alkaline environment provided by naocl cleaning in contrast mature membrane microbiota had closer phylogenetic distance and were much more stable after cleaning 3 3 detailed evolution of microbial community 3 3 1 membrane biofilm community different from suspended sludge generally the dominant phyla in all the biofilm and sludge samples were proteobacteria 29 72 followed by acidobacteria 10 20 bacteroidetes 4 20 firmicutes 2 12 planctomycetes 2 9 chloroflexi 3 7 and acinetobacter 2 6 fig 4 this is consistent with previous researches on microbial community in municipal wastewater mbr systems gao et al 2014a 2014b jo et al 2016 matar et al 2017 takada et al 2017 2018 ziegler et al 2016 proteobacteria were the most abundant phylum in both sludge and biofilms however the relative abundances of different classes in proteobacteria were notably dissimilar specifically γ proteobacteria were dominant in the biofilm of early stages whereas α proteobacteria and several taxa affiliated with β proteobacteria were dominated in the biofilm of mature stages fig 4 biomarker analysis revealed significantly higher p 0 05 abundance of phylum firmicutes in the biofilm than in the suspended sludge fig 5 a over 80 of the biofilm sequences were classified as sequences belonging to taxa f bacillaceae and f carnobacteriaceae fig 4 indicating their preference of adhesion and growth on the membrane surface it is worth noting that the abundances of bacteroidetes in the biofilm and sludge samples were positively correlated fig 5g but governed by different families the taxa f flavobacteriaceas and f weeksellaceae were dominant in biofilm samples while f chitinophagaceae and f cryomorphaceae were more abundant in sludge niches moreover the abundance of f xanthomonadaceae in bulk sludge samples was significantly higher than that in the biofilms which is inconsistent with the previous study reporting that f xanthomonadaceae mainly colonized on the membrane surface sun et al 2016 3 3 2 dynamic shift of biofilm microbiota responding to naocl cleaning on the early stages γ proteobacteria were significantly reduced after cleaning in contrast α proteobacteria β proteobacteria planctomycetes and acidobacteria were increased it is worth noting that α proteobacteria β proteobacteria and bacteroidetes grew consecutively and became the dominant taxa by day 160 23 fig 5 b 1 c 1 and g 1 moreover simper analysis revealed the major contributions that were responsible for dissimilarity at the family level table s4 with time lapse less taxa were affected by chemical cleaning indicating the adaptability of the biofilm microbiota the most influenced taxa were taxa f moraxellaceae f bacillaceae f comamonadaceae f pirellulaceae f favobacteriacea f saprospirae and f ellin6075 3 3 3 species interactions and topology of biofilm microbiota four rmt based network graphs were constructed to visualize the ecological interactions of species before and after cleaning on different fouling stages fig 6 a b the general network topological features table s5 revealed that all curves of the network connectivity distribution were fitted well with the r square of power law model r2 0 8 suggesting that the network exhibited scale free characteristics amaral et al 2000 the topological indices average path distance average clustering coefficient and modularity of the four networks were significantly different from those calculated based on random networks indicating that the networks were non random table s6 zhou et al 2010 in brief a significant change of the network topology was observed in the biofilm community on early stages after cleaning specifically the network after cleaning harbored significantly higher numbers of nodes 245 vs 184 links 906 vs 438 and connectivity 7 40 vs 4 36 indicating the formation of a more diverse and complex ecosystem due to naocl interference meanwhile an increase in the negative correlation from 51 to 65 between the dominated taxa f moraxellaceae and the other species was observed after cleaning revealing raised competition e g internal resource or spatial competition between species the networks of mature fouling stages showed no significant change after cleaning but lower clustering 0 144 vs 0 176 and modularity 0 869 vs 0 787 in comparison with early stage networks indicating stabilization of the biofilm community structure 3 3 4 keystone taxa resistant to naocl cleaning the roles of species in the networks were deciphered in network by the parameters of connectivity degree within the module zi and between modules pi and the species serving as modules and network hubs were regarded as keystone taxa that governed the structure and function of biofilm communities fig 6 it shows that the keystone taxa changed after naocl cleaning on both early fig 6 c 1 and mature fouling stages fig 6 c 2 the keystone taxa that appeared more than once mostly came from β proteobacteria f rhodocyclaceae f comamonadaceae bacteroidetes f saprospiraceae f chitinophagaceae planctomucetes c planctomycetia f pirellulaceae and unclassified acidobacteria tables s7 and s8 among which otu212 from f pirellulaceae was identified as a network hub of the biofilm community on the early stages after cleaning it is worth noting that taxa o burkholderiales remained a module hub in communities after cleaning and on mature stages otu506 and otu19776 belonging to taxa f comamonadaceae o burkholderiales became nodes with maximum eigenvector centrality and degree respectively fig s5 and table s7 both parameters underlined the importance of taxa f comamonadaceae to the structure of the network and hence the resistance to naocl cleaning 3 4 synchronized organic fouling accumulation analysis of the residual organic components ps pn and ha after online cleaning through 160 days of operation indicated the strong adherence of irreversible foulants that were hardly removed by successive naocl cleaning fig 7 a of all components ps was detected as the major foulant and it slowly increased from 29 4 mg m2 to 37 9 mg m2 within 124 days in comparison pn and ha were much less abundant with the contents of 25 7 mg m2 and 0 9 mg m2 respectively by day 124 at the mature fouling stage ps pn and ha significantly increased by 290 328 and 171 respectively indicating the accumulation of irreversible foulants on the membrane surface or inside the pores further information of the residual organic foulants was provided by 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy fig 7 b d fig 7c presented the fri distribution across the five empirical regions for aromatic protein like regions i ii fulvic acid like iii soluble microbial by product like iv and humic acid like organics v along with fouling development the relative contributions of aromatic proteins regions i and ii and humic acids regions iii and v decreased while that of soluble microbial by products region iv steadily increased from 15 to 30 the intensities of tryptophan like soluble microbial by products represented by peak t and aromatic proteins peak in region ii increased significantly with membrane fouling development fig 7d peak t and the region ii peak corresponding to lower and higher stokes shifts i e energy gaps between the excited and ground states of fluorophores could further indicate hydrophilic and hydrophobic foulants respectively xiao et al 2019 besides the peak intensities of humic like substances increased moderately it was reported that the hydrophobic aromatic proteins that were largely contained in loosely bound eps possess a high fouling potential su and zhang 2018 xiao et al 2018b 4 discussion 4 1 naocl cleaning increased biofilm community richness in early stage previous research revealed that the alpha diversity and composition of microbial communities coupling with microbial interactions were highly correlated with the resistance to environment disturbances however lab scale studies showed inconsistent results regarding the cleaning influence on the alpha diversity i e richness of biofilm microorganisms navarro et al 2016 piasecka et al 2015 this study revealed that the effect of naocl differed from early to mature fouling stages in a full scale mbr operation both richness and evenness increased on the early fouling stage but became stable on mature stages this may be due to the initial physicochemical interactions between bacterial cells and membrane which can be largely eliminated by hydrodynamic perturbations in a short time kang et al 2004 in addition since filtration was resumed immediately after backwashing in the full scale mbr system it is possible that quorum sensing stimulated the maturation of multi species biofilm layers cai and liu 2017 meanwhile the dynamic succession of the biofilm microbiota during long term operation revealed the significantly different response of microbes to naocl cleaning fig 3 the predominant taxa f moraxellaceae dramatically decreased after cleaning and rapidly regrew to dominate again before the next cleaning fig 4 over 80 sequences of f moraxellaceae belonged to genus acinetobacter which was reported as pioneer colonizers zhang et al 2006 and the high hydrophobicity and low zeta potential of the cell surface can make the bacteria strongly adhere onto the membrane surface in mbr biofouling bos et al 1999 loosdrecht et al 1987 in spite of the strong attachability the decreased abundance after exposure to naocl indicated its weak tolerance to oxidation nonetheless initial colonizers may play an important role in encouraging the maturation of the biofilm notably some initially low abundance species e g bacteroidetes and β proteobacteria gradually grew over time and became keystone taxa for irreversible fouling development interestingly in addition to alpha diversity the competition between species also increased after naocl cleaning on the early fouling stages which was mainly related to the taxa f moraxellaceae the initial biofilm contained low concentration of organic foulants naocl cleaning lessened the foulants and intensified the competition between key functional species for substrate resources or spatial positions thus gradually shaping stubborn microbiota during the maturation of the biofilm 4 2 the role of keystone taxa anti cleaning and fouling causing recent studies have shown that microbial communities harbor keystone taxa that govern community structure and function irrespective of their abundance banerjee et al 2018 the identified key taxa either growing from low to relatively high abundance over time or remaining in low abundance played important roles in biofilm community regardless of naocl cleaning the anti cleaning and proliferous abilities are inseparable from their microbial cell characteristics such as being oligotrophic secreting gel like polysaccharides and hydrolyzing refractory proteins for example bacteroidetes was frequently detected in mature biofilm sun et al 2016 with many species of this phylum containing a range of genes for alginic polysaccharide production to induce irreversible fouling albertsen et al 2013 guo et al 2015 sánchez 2018 taxa f flavobacteriaceae could survive from oxidative disinfections due to its remarkable ability to adhere onto surfaces liu et al 2011 moreover the species belonging to f saprospiraceae and f chitinophagaceae are able to grow under an oligotrophic environment due to their ability to hydrolyze proteins which further provides available nutrients for the proliferation of high potential fouling species bereschenko et al 2011 gutman et al 2014 it is worth noting that the network topological properties revealed the key roles of the less abundant taxa f comamonadaceae 6 and f xanthomonadaceae 4 1 in fouling causing and anti cleaning which was inconsistent with a lab scale research reporting their abundance but non discriminative roles in biofilm microbiota structure and fouling development zhang et al 2017 in contrast significant abundant f bacillaceae was identified in membrane biofilms by biomarker analysis which composed a separate module with a low weight function in microbiota network figs 5a and 6b zhang et al 2017 reported the adhesion preference of f bacillaceae in membrane pores however no significant correlation was observed between its abundance and tmp increase in this study and thence the role of f bacillaceae in the metabolic environment of biofilm communities and its contribution to membrane fouling need further verification the synchronized development of residual organic foulants polysaccharides aromatic proteins and soluble microbial products provided further information on the evolution of the keystone taxa the polysaccharides fig 7a can not only glue the cells together and attach them to the membrane surface but also protect the cells from oxidation stress wang et al 2013 as a key component of the biofilm matrix polysaccharides can provide structural stability for bacteria to establish a porous micro ecosystem to transfer nutrients and oxygen limoli et al 2015 the eem analysis revealed that several substances accumulated on the membrane surface also play important roles in resisting against chemical oxidation it was speculated that genes involved in tryptophan biosynthesis and transport were up regulated in the biofilm to tolerate oxidative stress hamilton et al 2009 in the presence of naocl the tryptophan like substances peak t may further be oxidized to condensed aromatic ring substances peak in region ii han et al 2017 and or degraded to anthranilate and indole like products by other bacterial species kim et al 2015 in addition oxidation of tyrosine may produce e dityrosine protein protein cross linkage via tyrosine tyrosine bonding giulivi et al 2003 song et al 2018 both tyrosine and tryptophan like soluble microbial by products could promote biofilm formation and obstruct naocl cleaning the correlation between these primary organic compounds and keystone taxa indicates the anti cleaning and fouling causing characteristics of cells e g flagella for adhesion and biofilm expansion and their eps e g high viscosity large molecular weight and high polysaccharide content gutman et al 2013 ishizaki et al 2016 4 3 implications the above results have revealed that the regular online naocl cleaning is inadequate to effectively control irreversible fouling development to enhance the efficiency of online chemical cleaning more targeted strategies should be adopted possibly involving the following aspects a disturbing the biofilm development and maturation via combination use of varied cleaning agents e g acids complexants surfactants and enzymes in addition to naocl to deal with chlorine resistant eps smp specific enzymes that are targeted on extracellular polysaccharides e g β glucanase mutanase and xanthan gellan lyase and proteins e g proteinase k and trypsin could be considered nagaraj et al 2017 additionally chaotropic agents e g urea are also expected to replace conventional chemicals in practical application with an ideal cleaning efficiency sanawar et al 2019 b optimization of cleaning conditions such as cleaning cycles e g cleaning frequency and duration hydrodynamics e g backflushing strength and temperature e g an increase to 45 60 c can effectively dissociate tightly bound eps from cells to enhance cleaning efficiency pre backflushing is also an effective way to remove reversible foulants and promote mass transfer of the reagent towards irreversible foulants c further understanding of microbiology and cell surface properties of the keystone species e g f comamonadaceae f rhodocyclaceae and f xanthomonadaceae for targeted suppression of their attachment and growth in the biofilm firstly with the keystone species known specific enzymes e g lysozyme and polysaccharide lyase could be developed a possible approach is to isolate the enzymes from the keystone strains themselves according to the phenomenon of bacterial self degradation zykwinska et al 2018 secondly cleaning using different reagents in an alternated manner may disturb the growth of the keystone taxa and the formation of the whole biofilm thirdly interrupting the biofilm microbiota network structure by quorum quenching is feasible to prevent the formation of chemical resistant biofilm d deeper study on eps characteristics e g surface properties and molecular structure and their interactions with the biofilm microorganisms to support the biofouling control strategies 5 conclusion online naocl cleaning induced different impacts on biofilm communities from early to mature fouling stages during long term operation of a full scale mbr both richness and evenness of the microorganisms increased on the early stages but became stable on the mature stages naocl cleaning also changed the biofilm community structure reduced the relative abundance of dominant groups and increased its competition with other species the membrane biofilm harbored keystone taxa that guided biofilm structure and function in anti cleaning and irreversible fouling development and naocl cleaning significantly impacted the evolution of keystone taxa over time the residual organic foulants of polysaccharides aromatic proteins and soluble microbial by products were accumulated synchronously with the evolution of keystone taxa suggesting the synergistic role of microbiota and concomitant organics in fouling development in the full scale mbr

elaborated the effect of online naocl cleaning on the dynamic development of membrane biofilm microbiota during long term operation of a large scale mbr for municipal wastewater treatment 40 000 m3 d four times of membrane autopsies were conducted during 160 days operation to scrutinize the microbial community and concomitant organic foulants the transmembrane pressure difference tmp development revealed limited effect of 30 min online naocl cleaning on long term biofouling removal naocl not only altered the structure of biofilm communities but also increased the richness and evenness on early fouling stages meanwhile network analysis revealed the keystone taxa f comamonadaceae that played key roles in stabilizing community structure and developing anti cleaning and irreversible fouling propensity of the biofilm naocl cleaning also impacted the evolving of keystone taxa by intensifying the competition between the dominated taxa f moraxellaceae and other species during early

keystone taxa during long term operation of a full scale mbr for municipal wastewater treatment and revealing its correlation with organic foulants this research can be instructive for improving design of online chemical cleaning protocols involving for instance chemical agents cleaning intensity and timing that are oriented to full scale mbr applications 2 material and methods 2 1 the full scale mbr and sample collection the anaerobic anoxic aerobic membrane bioreactor aao mbr system with a capability of 40000 m3 d for domestic wastewater treatment and reclamation is located in beijing china the experiment employed a new membrane module beijing origin water technology co ltd china as the research subject a pvdf hollow fiber membrane with a nominal pore size of 0 1 μm and a total membrane area of 16800 m2 was installed in the membrane tank the characteristics of the raw wastewater are shown in table s1 the transmembrane pressure tmp was monitored by an online pressure gauge online chemical cleaning was carried out about twice per month depending on the tmp level with 300 ppm naocl ph 12 to backflush the membrane for 30 min membrane samples were collected from the module which was operated from 3 july to 12 december 160 days of the same year membrane samples before termed as bm and after online cleaning termed as am were collected on day 37 64 124 and 160 before cleaning triplicate hollow fiber membrane samples were cut with a length of 1 5 m using a sterile steel knife from three different locations on the fouled membrane module the same procedure was conducted after the membrane was cleaned and the filtration had been resumed for 10 min membrane samples were then sealed in an aseptic self sealing bag containing ultrapure water immersed absorbent cotton the bulk sludge samples 50 ml each were collected with sterilized centrifuge tubes before membrane biofilm samples were collected all samples were quickly returned to the laboratory and stored at 80 c until further analysis 2 2 membrane surface physiochemical characterization the surface morphology of the fouled membranes was examined using a zeiss field emission scanning electron microscope sem zeiss merlin compact germany at 15 0 kv confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm was performed to characterize the residual microbial cells and extracellular polymeric substances eps on cleaned membrane surfaces fluorescein isothiocyanate fitc concanavalin a calcofluor white and syto 63 were applied to stain protein α polysaccharide β polysaccharide and cells respectively the stained membranes were frozen at 20 c and sectioned into specimens 100 μm thick using a cryomicrotome leica cm 1950 germany the details of the staining method and clsm imaging were described in a previous report chen et al 2006 after pretreatment the cross sections of hollow fiber membrane were imaged with a confocal laser scanning microscope zeiss lsm 780 carl zeiss micro imaging gmbh germany a zen software zeiss germany was used to process the raw clsm images 2 3 microbial community analysis prior to dna extraction the membrane surfaces were rinsed with 1 pbs solarbio to remove loosely deposited sludge huang et al 2008 and six parallel membrane samples length 1 cm were cut into small pieces using sterilized scissors the samples of membranes and bulk sludge were subjected to dna extraction using a powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc carlsbad ca following the manufacturer s instructions extraction yield and purity were assessed using a nanodrop nd 1000 spectrophotometer ctrophotometer thermo fisher scientific waltham ma the v4 region of the 16s rrna genes was amplified using 515f 806r primers and cycling 30 cycles 94 c 30 s 52 c 30 s 72 c 30 s and then 10 min at 72 c after an initial denaturation of 5 min at 94 c biorad s1000 bio rad laboratory ca polymerase chain reactions pcr were performed in duplicate amplicons containing error correcting barcode sequences were pooled visualized on an agarose gel and quantified using genetools software syngene cambridge uk equimolar amounts from all amplicons were pooled together into a single composite sample and purified using an ezna gel extraction kit omega usa before illumina hiseq2000 sequencing at magigene guangzhou china operational taxonomic units otus were identified using the uparse function within usearch edgar 2010 poor quality reads and chimeric sequences where a single organism comprises genetically distinct cells were removed using usearch default settings otus were classified using the ribosomal database project rdp database the sequencing reads were deposited into the sequence read archive sra of the national center for biotechnology information ncbi under study accession number sub5375325 for alpha diversity measurements both non phylogeny based metrics observed otus shannon diversity index h and chao 1 richness estimator and phylogeny based metric phylogenetic diversity pd whole tree were calculated using the program qiime phyla with significant differences among microbial community samples were chosen as biomarkers using the kruskal wallis test p 0 01 analysis of similarities anosim was applied to show the differences of microbial communities between the groups using the vegan and permute packages within the r environment similarity percentage simper analysis was conducted with the vegan package to identify the major taxonomy under class level responsible for the differences observed between the biofilm samples before and after chemical cleaning other statistical analyses for microbial communities were implemented using relevant r packages the beta diversity was analyzed based on weighted unifrac distance calculating the total otus chang et al 2011 and visualized by non metric multi dimensional scaling nmds using omicshare tools http www omicshare com tools 2 4 network construction using the rmt based approach the phylogenetic molecular ecological networks pmens were constructed on a comprehensive molecular ecological network analysis pipeline http ieg2 ou edu mena in brief the relative abundance of otu numbers was used to obtain the correlation matrices which were then converted into similarity matrices each network was separated into modules by fast greedy modularity in addition for network comparison corresponding random networks of both pmens were generated using the maslov sneppen method maslov and sneppen 2002 and keeping the numbers of nodes and edges constant but rewiring all of the edge positions in the pmens then a standard z test was applied to determine the significance between the pmens and their corresponding random networks the r square of power law 0 8 and modularity 0 4 were used to identify small world property and modular structure of the networks telesford et al 2011 gephi webatlas paris france was used for network visualization and modular analysis bastian et al 2009 2 5 membrane residual organic foulants analysis the residual organic foulants from am samples were extracted using naoh 0 01 mol l kimura et al 2009 briefly membrane surface was wiped with a sponge and rinsed with sterile water to remove loosely bounded foulants before being cutting into pieces then the membrane samples were soaked in naoh for 24 h at 20 c the foulants were quantified as the concentrations of polysaccharide ps protein pn and humic acid ha expressed as glucose bovine serum protein and humic acid equivalents respectively the residual organic foulants were further characterized using three dimensional fluorescence excitation emission matrix 3d eem spectroscopy f 4500 hitachi tokyo japan the intensities and locations of the eem peaks were identified according to the method of xiao et al 2018a 3 results 3 1 overall fouling development fig 1 shows the tmp development during 160 days of operation 3rd july 12th december on stage i from 1 to 60 days the tmp increasing was slow and the occasional cleaning procedure was efficient to maintain membrane performance less stable membrane performance was observed on stage ii from 61 to 90 days it is worth mentioning that the low tmp at the beginning of september was caused by operational disruption due to the influent shortage thereafter the tmp increased to 27 kpa by 26th september and dropped back to 20 kpa after cleaning on stage iii from 91 to 124 days the tmp sharply increased from 30 to 50 kpa although it recovered by 37 after chemical cleaning on day 124 fig 1c the tmp drop after day 124 was caused by the 50 cut down of treatment capacity and shortened filtration cycle due to the start up of a new mbr plant nearby 3 2 alpha and beta diversity of microbial communities the 16s sequencing generated a total of 2 379 401 high quality reads from 12 bulk sludge samples and 48 membrane biofilm samples before and after online chemical cleaning the sequences were clustered into 152 715 otus at a 97 sequence identity threshold analysis of similarity anosim showed significant inter group differences p 0 001 r 0 803 for am p 0 001 r 0 96 for bm fig s2 wilcoxon signed rank test showed significant difference p 0 01 between bm and am samples overall fig s3 the alpha diversity showed that the richness index of chao 1 and evenness index of shannon were significantly increased after the online chemical cleaning on days 37 and 64 p 0 05 fig 2 the observed species and pd whole tree also showed significant higher species richness of the biofilm microbiota after the online chemical cleaning on day 37 d p 0 05 however with the extension of operation time days 124 and 160 neither richness nor evenness of species displayed significant variation after the cleaning overall the diversity indices for richness and evenness to a certain extent revealed the characteristics of bacterial communities and formation of biofilm adapting to online naocl cleaning the beta diversity of bacterial communities between membrane biofilm and suspended sludge was compared based on weighted uni frac distance and visualized by nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds fig 3 the results show that based on phylogeny bulk sludge samples were highly dissimilar from membrane biofilm samples and early biofilms were dissimilar to mature biofilms additionally the abundance and phylogenetic distance of early biofilms significantly changed after cleaning indicating that the initial biofilm microbiota were more susceptible to the oxidative and also alkaline environment provided by naocl cleaning in contrast mature membrane microbiota had closer phylogenetic distance and were much more stable after cleaning 3 3 detailed evolution of microbial community 3 3 1 membrane biofilm community different from suspended sludge generally the dominant phyla in all the biofilm and sludge samples were proteobacteria 29 72 followed by acidobacteria 10 20 bacteroidetes 4 20 firmicutes 2 12 planctomycetes 2 9 chloroflexi 3 7 and acinetobacter 2 6 fig 4 this is consistent with previous researches on microbial community in municipal wastewater mbr systems gao et al 2014a 2014b jo et al 2016 matar et al 2017 takada et al 2017 2018 ziegler et al 2016 proteobacteria were the most abundant phylum in both sludge and biofilms however the relative abundances of different classes in proteobacteria were notably dissimilar specifically γ proteobacteria were dominant in the biofilm of early stages whereas α proteobacteria and several taxa affiliated with β proteobacteria were dominated in the biofilm of mature stages fig 4 biomarker analysis revealed significantly higher p 0 05 abundance of phylum firmicutes in the biofilm than in the suspended sludge fig 5 a over 80 of the biofilm sequences were classified as sequences belonging to taxa f bacillaceae and f carnobacteriaceae fig 4 indicating their preference of adhesion and growth on the membrane surface it is worth noting that the abundances of bacteroidetes in the biofilm and sludge samples were positively correlated fig 5g but governed by different families the taxa f flavobacteriaceas and f weeksellaceae were dominant in biofilm samples while f chitinophagaceae and f cryomorphaceae were more abundant in sludge niches moreover the abundance of f xanthomonadaceae in bulk sludge samples was significantly higher than that in the biofilms which is inconsistent with the previous study reporting that f xanthomonadaceae mainly colonized on the membrane surface sun et al 2016 3 3 2 dynamic shift of biofilm microbiota responding to naocl cleaning on the early stages γ proteobacteria were significantly reduced after cleaning in contrast α proteobacteria β proteobacteria planctomycetes and acidobacteria were increased it is worth noting that α proteobacteria β proteobacteria and bacteroidetes grew consecutively and became the dominant taxa by day 160 23 fig 5 b 1 c 1 and g 1 moreover simper analysis revealed the major contributions that were responsible for dissimilarity at the family level table s4 with time lapse less taxa were affected by chemical cleaning indicating the adaptability of the biofilm microbiota the most influenced taxa were taxa f moraxellaceae f bacillaceae f comamonadaceae f pirellulaceae f favobacteriacea f saprospirae and f ellin6075 3 3 3 species interactions and topology of biofilm microbiota four rmt based network graphs were constructed to visualize the ecological interactions of species before and after cleaning on different fouling stages fig 6 a b the general network topological features table s5 revealed that all curves of the network connectivity distribution were fitted well with the r square of power law model r2 0 8 suggesting that the network exhibited scale free characteristics amaral et al 2000 the topological indices average path distance average clustering coefficient and modularity of the four networks were significantly different from those calculated based on random networks indicating that the networks were non random table s6 zhou et al 2010 in brief a significant change of the network topology was observed in the biofilm community on early stages after cleaning specifically the network after cleaning harbored significantly higher numbers of nodes 245 vs 184 links 906 vs 438 and connectivity 7 40 vs 4 36 indicating the formation of a more diverse and complex ecosystem due to naocl interference meanwhile an increase in the negative correlation from 51 to 65 between the dominated taxa f moraxellaceae and the other species was observed after cleaning revealing raised competition e g internal resource or spatial competition between species the networks of mature fouling stages showed no significant change after cleaning but lower clustering 0 144 vs 0 176 and modularity 0 869 vs 0 787 in comparison with early stage networks indicating stabilization of the biofilm community structure 3 3 4 keystone taxa resistant to naocl cleaning the roles of species in the networks were deciphered in network by the parameters of connectivity degree within the module zi and between modules pi and the species serving as modules and network hubs were regarded as keystone taxa that governed the structure and function of biofilm communities fig 6 it shows that the keystone taxa changed after naocl cleaning on both early fig 6 c 1 and mature fouling stages fig 6 c 2 the keystone taxa that appeared more than once mostly came from β proteobacteria f rhodocyclaceae f comamonadaceae bacteroidetes f saprospiraceae f chitinophagaceae planctomucetes c planctomycetia f pirellulaceae and unclassified acidobacteria tables s7 and s8 among which otu212 from f pirellulaceae was identified as a network hub of the biofilm community on the early stages after cleaning it is worth noting that taxa o burkholderiales remained a module hub in communities after cleaning and on mature stages otu506 and otu19776 belonging to taxa f comamonadaceae o burkholderiales became nodes with maximum eigenvector centrality and degree respectively fig s5 and table s7 both parameters underlined the importance of taxa f comamonadaceae to the structure of the network and hence the resistance to naocl cleaning 3 4 synchronized organic fouling accumulation analysis of the residual organic components ps pn and ha after online cleaning through 160 days of operation indicated the strong adherence of irreversible foulants that were hardly removed by successive naocl cleaning fig 7 a of all components ps was detected as the major foulant and it slowly increased from 29 4 mg m2 to 37 9 mg m2 within 124 days in comparison pn and ha were much less abundant with the contents of 25 7 mg m2 and 0 9 mg m2 respectively by day 124 at the mature fouling stage ps pn and ha significantly increased by 290 328 and 171 respectively indicating the accumulation of irreversible foulants on the membrane surface or inside the pores further information of the residual organic foulants was provided by 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy fig 7 b d fig 7c presented the fri distribution across the five empirical regions for aromatic protein like regions i ii fulvic acid like iii soluble microbial by product like iv and humic acid like organics v along with fouling development the relative contributions of aromatic proteins regions i and ii and humic acids regions iii and v decreased while that of soluble microbial by products region iv steadily increased from 15 to 30 the intensities of tryptophan like soluble microbial by products represented by peak t and aromatic proteins peak in region ii increased significantly with membrane fouling development fig 7d peak t and the region ii peak corresponding to lower and higher stokes shifts i e energy gaps between the excited and ground states of fluorophores could further indicate hydrophilic and hydrophobic foulants respectively xiao et al 2019 besides the peak intensities of humic like substances increased moderately it was reported that the hydrophobic aromatic proteins that were largely contained in loosely bound eps possess a high fouling potential su and zhang 2018 xiao et al 2018b 4 discussion 4 1 naocl cleaning increased biofilm community richness in early stage previous research revealed that the alpha diversity and composition of microbial communities coupling with microbial interactions were highly correlated with the resistance to environment disturbances however lab scale studies showed inconsistent results regarding the cleaning influence on the alpha diversity i e richness of biofilm microorganisms navarro et al 2016 piasecka et al 2015 this study revealed that the effect of naocl differed from early to mature fouling stages in a full scale mbr operation both richness and evenness increased on the early fouling stage but became stable on mature stages this may be due to the initial physicochemical interactions between bacterial cells and membrane which can be largely eliminated by hydrodynamic perturbations in a short time kang et al 2004 in addition since filtration was resumed immediately after backwashing in the full scale mbr system it is possible that quorum sensing stimulated the maturation of multi species biofilm layers cai and liu 2017 meanwhile the dynamic succession of the biofilm microbiota during long term operation revealed the significantly different response of microbes to naocl cleaning fig 3 the predominant taxa f moraxellaceae dramatically decreased after cleaning and rapidly regrew to dominate again before the next cleaning fig 4 over 80 sequences of f moraxellaceae belonged to genus acinetobacter which was reported as pioneer colonizers zhang et al 2006 and the high hydrophobicity and low zeta potential of the cell surface can make the bacteria strongly adhere onto the membrane surface in mbr biofouling bos et al 1999 loosdrecht et al 1987 in spite of the strong attachability the decreased abundance after exposure to naocl indicated its weak tolerance to oxidation nonetheless initial colonizers may play an important role in encouraging the maturation of the biofilm notably some initially low abundance species e g bacteroidetes and β proteobacteria gradually grew over time and became keystone taxa for irreversible fouling development interestingly in addition to alpha diversity the competition between species also increased after naocl cleaning on the early fouling stages which was mainly related to the taxa f moraxellaceae the initial biofilm contained low concentration of organic foulants naocl cleaning lessened the foulants and intensified the competition between key functional species for substrate resources or spatial positions thus gradually shaping stubborn microbiota during the maturation of the biofilm 4 2 the role of keystone taxa anti cleaning and fouling causing recent studies have shown that microbial communities harbor keystone taxa that govern community structure and function irrespective of their abundance banerjee et al 2018 the identified key taxa either growing from low to relatively high abundance over time or remaining in low abundance played important roles in biofilm community regardless of naocl cleaning the anti cleaning and proliferous abilities are inseparable from their microbial cell characteristics such as being oligotrophic secreting gel like polysaccharides and hydrolyzing refractory proteins for example bacteroidetes was frequently detected in mature biofilm sun et al 2016 with many species of this phylum containing a range of genes for alginic polysaccharide production to induce irreversible fouling albertsen et al 2013 guo et al 2015 sánchez 2018 taxa f flavobacteriaceae could survive from oxidative disinfections due to its remarkable ability to adhere onto surfaces liu et al 2011 moreover the species belonging to f saprospiraceae and f chitinophagaceae are able to grow under an oligotrophic environment due to their ability to hydrolyze proteins which further provides available nutrients for the proliferation of high potential fouling species bereschenko et al 2011 gutman et al 2014 it is worth noting that the network topological properties revealed the key roles of the less abundant taxa f comamonadaceae 6 and f xanthomonadaceae 4 1 in fouling causing and anti cleaning which was inconsistent with a lab scale research reporting their abundance but non discriminative roles in biofilm microbiota structure and fouling development zhang et al 2017 in contrast significant abundant f bacillaceae was identified in membrane biofilms by biomarker analysis which composed a separate module with a low weight function in microbiota network figs 5a and 6b zhang et al 2017 reported the adhesion preference of f bacillaceae in membrane pores however no significant correlation was observed between its abundance and tmp increase in this study and thence the role of f bacillaceae in the metabolic environment of biofilm communities and its contribution to membrane fouling need further verification the synchronized development of residual organic foulants polysaccharides aromatic proteins and soluble microbial products provided further information on the evolution of the keystone taxa the polysaccharides fig 7a can not only glue the cells together and attach them to the membrane surface but also protect the cells from oxidation stress wang et al 2013 as a key component of the biofilm matrix polysaccharides can provide structural stability for bacteria to establish a porous micro ecosystem to transfer nutrients and oxygen limoli et al 2015 the eem analysis revealed that several substances accumulated on the membrane surface also play important roles in resisting against chemical oxidation it was speculated that genes involved in tryptophan biosynthesis and transport were up regulated in the biofilm to tolerate oxidative stress hamilton et al 2009 in the presence of naocl the tryptophan like substances peak t may further be oxidized to condensed aromatic ring substances peak in region ii han et al 2017 and or degraded to anthranilate and indole like products by other bacterial species kim et al 2015 in addition oxidation of tyrosine may produce e dityrosine protein protein cross linkage via tyrosine tyrosine bonding giulivi et al 2003 song et al 2018 both tyrosine and tryptophan like soluble microbial by products could promote biofilm formation and obstruct naocl cleaning the correlation between these primary organic compounds and keystone taxa indicates the anti cleaning and fouling causing characteristics of cells e g flagella for adhesion and biofilm expansion and their eps e g high viscosity large molecular weight and high polysaccharide content gutman et al 2013 ishizaki et al 2016 4 3 implications the above results have revealed that the regular online naocl cleaning is inadequate to effectively control irreversible fouling development to enhance the efficiency of online chemical cleaning more targeted strategies should be adopted possibly involving the following aspects a disturbing the biofilm development and maturation via combination use of varied cleaning agents e g acids complexants surfactants and enzymes in addition to naocl to deal with chlorine resistant eps smp specific enzymes that are targeted on extracellular polysaccharides e g β glucanase mutanase and xanthan gellan lyase and proteins e g proteinase k and trypsin could be considered nagaraj et al 2017 additionally chaotropic agents e g urea are also expected to replace conventional chemicals in practical application with an ideal cleaning efficiency sanawar et al 2019 b optimization of cleaning conditions such as cleaning cycles e g cleaning frequency and duration hydrodynamics e g backflushing strength and temperature e g an increase to 45 60 c can effectively dissociate tightly bound eps from cells to enhance cleaning efficiency pre backflushing is also an effective way to remove reversible foulants and promote mass transfer of the reagent towards irreversible foulants c further understanding of microbiology and cell surface properties of the keystone species e g f comamonadaceae f rhodocyclaceae and f xanthomonadaceae for targeted suppression of their attachment and growth in the biofilm firstly with the keystone species known specific enzymes e g lysozyme and polysaccharide lyase could be developed a possible approach is to isolate the enzymes from the keystone strains themselves according to the phenomenon of bacterial self degradation zykwinska et al 2018 secondly cleaning using different reagents in an alternated manner may disturb the growth of the keystone taxa and the formation of the whole biofilm thirdly interrupting the biofilm microbiota network structure by quorum quenching is feasible to prevent the formation of chemical resistant biofilm d deeper study on eps characteristics e g surface properties and molecular structure and their interactions with the biofilm microorganisms to support the biofouling control strategies 5 conclusion online naocl cleaning induced different impacts on biofilm communities from early to mature fouling stages during long term operation of a full scale mbr both richness and evenness of the microorganisms increased on the early stages but became stable on the mature stages naocl cleaning also changed the biofilm community structure reduced the relative abundance of dominant groups and increased its competition with other species the membrane biofilm harbored keystone taxa that guided biofilm structure and function in anti cleaning and irreversible fouling development and naocl cleaning significantly impacted the evolution of keystone taxa over time the residual organic foulants of polysaccharides aromatic proteins and soluble microbial by products were accumulated synchronously with the evolution of keystone taxa suggesting the synergistic role of microbiota and concomitant organics in fouling development in the full scale mbr

18186,groundwater resources are the main supply of freshwater for human activities however in the last fifty years aquifers have become more susceptible to chemical pollution due to human activities the concept of groundwater vulnerability constitutes a worldwide accepted tool for water protection and planning however the existing methods and modified versions do not account for all the hydrogeochemical processes that drive anthropogenic pollution the hydrogeochemical processes occurring within an aquifer can be determined using multivariate statistical analysis in this study a specific vulnerability method named svap specific vulnerability to anthropogenic pollution is proposed the index is based on seven quantitative parameters depth to groundwater recharge nitrate losses hydraulic resistance of the vadose zone aquifer thickness hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer and slope weights of anthropogenic factors were determined by factor analysis and used to validate the svap methodology the parameters classification was selected according to the highest pearson s correlation coefficient with factor weights and then grouped via a linear combination the new index was applied in two watersheds the florina basin greece and the garigliano river basin italy both of which possess complex hydrogeochemical regimes the main hydrogeochemical processes acting in the study areas were identified via factor analysis which revealed that the anthropogenic pollution in both sites was due mainly to chemical fertilizers and manure verification of the svap method produced correlation coefficients with nitrate concentrations of 0 75 and 0 62 in florina and garigliano respectively the proposed svap method is more reliable and flexible than standard vulnerability assessment methods and can be easily adapted for complex aquifers graphical abstract image 1 keywords factor analysis mineralization processes anthropogenic pollution garigliano plain florina basin groundwater protection 1 introduction groundwater constitutes a crucial and life sustaining resource throughout the world alley et al 2002 half of the world s population depends on groundwater resources for drinking water irrigation domestic and industrial use oki and kanae 2006 additionally groundwater often supports critical ecosystems of surface water bodies however groundwater is being polluted and depleted at both regional and local scales aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 decreased groundwater quality is often attributed to the increased and uncontrolled use of chemical compounds while climate change and population growth aggravate this situation razandi et al 2015 agricultural activities such as the application of chemical fertilizers and manure have been identified as the main sources of surface and groundwater pollution since the early twentieth century while nitrate no3 is considered the main pollutant at global scale ascott et al 2017 the use of polluted groundwater may pose risks to human health hence prevention and monitoring have become necessary to guarantee water quality in this framework vulnerability assessment and mapping could be an important tool for the protection and management of groundwater resources vulnerability refers to the possibility that a contaminant shall percolate and diffuse from the ground surface into a groundwater system margat 1968 and can be classified as either intrinsic or specific vulnerability stigter et al 2006 the former defines vulnerability solely as a function of hydrogeological factors and the latter defines vulnerability by the potential impacts of specific land uses and contaminants based on data availability vulnerability mapping can be applied anywhere in the world by focusing on anthropogenic and or geogenic sources of contamination brindha and elango 2015 there are three main approaches to aquifer vulnerability assessment i overlay index methods ii process based simulation models and iii statistical methods national research council 1993 the recent trend in groundwater vulnerability assessment is the combination of these approaches to produce hybrid models that incorporate various data sets a detailed analysis of vulnerability assessment methods is presented in machiwal et al 2018 who concluded that the reliability of a vulnerability map strongly depends on data availability and the experience of the map s creator the most frequently applied rating models in the last thirty years are drastic aller et al 1987 avi van stemproot et al 1993 and sintacs civita and de maio 2004 the choice of the applied method mainly depends on aquifer type e g karst or porous aquifer while data availability should also be considered kazakis et al 2015 it is also crucial to understand the hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical regime of the study area in the mediterranean basin sintacs and sintacs derived methods are the most commonly applied both for intrinsic and specific vulnerability assessment busico et al 2017 matzeu et al 2017 to verify the reliability of a vulnerability assessment no3 concentration in groundwater has been selected as the most common indicator of anthropogenic impact white et al 2013 and is regularly used for the validation of rating models arauzo 2017 elçi 2017 pacheco et al 2015 under natural conditions no3 is not present at high concentrations over 10 mg l in groundwater instead its presence in groundwater usually indicates pollution from anthropogenic activities such as agricultural practices sewage effluents or wastewater from desalination plants singh et al 2015 the plume flow of no3 within an aquifer can be indicative so as to delineate groundwater protection zones and vulnerability maps using spatial variables jang and chen 2015 nevertheless in several applications no correlation between intrinsic vulnerability indexes and no3 concentrations in groundwater has been found lasagna et al 2018 thus showing that it is crucial to adapt the vulnerability index to the hydrogeological characteristics of each study area busico et al 2017 proposed a sintacs modification sintacs svn and sintacs svs where avi and los indices aschonitis et al 2012 together with aquifer thickness replaced initial parameters in order to eliminate subjectivity classes and weights were defined and calibrated using linear correlation with observed no3 and so4 2 concentrations in groundwater and produced more reliable results than the standard sintacs application however no3 and so4 2 are not the only compounds responsible for groundwater pollution and they could be connected to other contaminants such as uranium u and potassium k especially where phosphate fertilizers are employed liesch et al 2015 therefore a validation process using only no3 may lead to incomplete or erroneous conceptual models in this context the understanding of the hydrogeochemical processes governing groundwater quality is a crucial requirement especially in heterogeneous environments in many cases linear correlation between solute species is not sufficient to describe the distribution of contaminants einax et al 1997 and statistical tools like factor analysis fa positive matrix factorization pmf and principal component analysis pca have to be used instead zhang et al 2012 zanotti et al 2019 these techniques examine the relationships between variables and generate a list of significant factors that group the initial variables the interpolation of factor weights using geostatistical tools could be a useful technique to calibrate parameters of the modified vulnerability approaches busico et al 2018 to the best of our knowledge a vulnerability assessment method that integrates hydrogeological with hydrogeochemical processes and multivariate statistical analysis is still missing in the existing literature for example mondal et al 2017 recently applied conventional drastic and verified the vulnerability classification using ionic molar ratio but without incorporating hydrogeochemical characterization within the vulnerability assessment javadi et al 2017 used k means clustering methods to modify drastic by reducing factors and eliminating the use of weights and scores of the parameters no3 chloride and total dissolved solids were used to correlate the vulnerability map this concept is innovative however reducing the involved parameters decreases the holistic representation of the studied system to fill this gap a new process for groundwater vulnerability assessment is introduced in the framework of this study a modified rating method for specific vulnerability to anthropogenic pollution svap was developed and tested following this concept the research was divided into the following stages i identification of the processes acting within the selected study sites following a combined hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical interpretation ii discrimination between geogenic and anthropogenic processes using fa iii construction and testing of the vulnerability assessment with the svap methodology two study areas were selected for this purpose the garigliano river plain southern italy and florina basin north western greece these aquifers are highly suitable to apply and test the proposed methodological approach since in both sites the standard index based methods have already been applied busico et al 2019 voudouris et al 2018 and showed poor correlation with no3 concentration 2 study sites two study areas were chosen for the development and application of the novel vulnerability method accounting for both hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical regimes reliable data concerning geological geomorphological hydrological and climatic characteristics as well as hydrogeochemical hydraulic and geometrical data of the aquifers were available for both sites general site characteristics are described below 2 1 the garigliano river plain the garigliano river plain is located in the northern part of the campania region southern italy fig 1 a the plain is a graben filled with alluvial and volcanic materials namely upper miocene quaternary deposits and continental clastic deposits from the garigliano river and volcano clastic sediments from the roccamonfina volcano ducci and sellerino 2013 it covers an area of 100 km2 and is bordered by the massico relief to the south the garigliano river to the north the tyrrhenian sea to the west and the roccamonfina volcano to the east the main aquifer is unconfined and is hosted in alluvial deposits of volcanic origin inland and in marine deposits towards the coast low hydraulic conductivity lenses of alluvial marshes and lacustrine deposits are present within the main aquifer the climate is mediterranean with a mean annual precipitation for the period 1990 2017 of around 800 mm occurring mainly between october and may the land use is dominated by agricultural fields that cover more than 80 of the territory and by farming activities that are concentrated in the centre of the plain fig s1 highly populated towns are located near the mountain ranges and along the coastline 2 2 the florina basin florina basin is located in western macedonia northern greece and covers an area of 319 km2 fig 1b the mean altitude is 620 m and the topography is almost flat with a slope of 1 5 the study site includes the alluvial aquifer in the lowlands of the basin the climate of the region is continental with a mean annual precipitation for the period 1992 2017 of 472 mm and a mean annual temperature of 12 6 c the rainfall occurs mainly from october to april florina basin is part of the hellenic pelagonian geotectonic zone neogene and quaternary sediments characterize the lowlands of the study area and a multiple aquifer system is developed within these sediments the alluvial unconfined aquifer covers an area of 180 km2 and comprises alternations of sands gravels conglomerates and clays hydraulic conductivity ranges between 3 10 3 m s and 4 10 6 m s groundwater depth ranges from less than 1 m to more than 45 m below ground surface and the main direction of groundwater flow is from s to n the water demands of this area are mainly covered by the exploitation of groundwater via numerous wells located in the alluvial aquifer voudouris et al 2018 the land use is dominated by agricultural fields that cover the majority of the basin fig s2 3 materials and methods the development of a new hybrid method for vulnerability assessment requires detailed hydrogeological research including the collection and analysis of hydraulic data lithological profiles and aquifer water level measurements hence the conceptualization of the hydro system can be obtained in this study the hydrogeochemical regime was also incorporated into the vulnerability concept and the detailed evaluation of hydrogeochemical data was obtained based on multivariate statistical analysis results of the factor analysis were used for model development and validation a flow chart of the methodological process is shown in fig 2 3 1 data sampling and analysis the hydrogeological data were obtained from previous studies whereas chemical analysis of groundwater and water level measurements were performed for both study sites data on aquifer structure and material were obtained from the analysis of geological maps and lithological profiles of boreholes pumping tests were performed to determine the hydraulic parameters of both aquifers particle size analysis and falling head tests were performed in soils and the vadose zones to determine soil texture hydraulic conductivity and organic matter content the climatic variables of rainfall temperature and evapotranspiration were used to estimate recharge digital elevation models were obtained from digitized topographic maps resulting in a high resolution cell size of 5 5 m in the dry period of 2016 forty three 43 groundwater samples were collected from the agricultural and domestic wells located in the alluvial plain of garigliano river and thirty 30 samples were taken from florina basin in both cases all wells are located within the shallow unconfined aquifer electrical conductivity temperature and ph values were measured in the field major ions ca2 mg2 na k so4 2 no3 were determined by ion chromatography ic a 100 ml aliquot of each sample intended for hco3 measurement was titrated three times with certified 0 1 mol l hcl ionic error balance for all analysed samples did not exceed 5 trace elements with concentrations higher than the detection limit fe mn zn b v li u cr ba sr as and ni were also determined for the garigliano plain using an agilent 7500 ce icp ms with intact interference reaction cell accuracy was verified following epa method 2008 and the relative percentage error was recorded as less than 7 3 2 statistical analysis factor analysis fa is an efficient multivariate statistical tool that can reduce many variables into fewer numbers of factors that describe all the hydrogeochemical processes occurring within an investigated area voudouris et al 1997 fa extracts the maximum common variance from all variables and allocates them a common score the relationship of each variable to the underlying factor is expressed by the factor loading the level of meaningfulness is given by the kaiser meyer olkin kmo parameter that must be higher than 0 5 voudouris et al 2000 in this study r type fa was used to extract all the hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical processes characterizing the initial datasets while pearson s correlation coefficient r between factor weights and parameters was used to calibrate the vulnerability assessment the main advantage of using fa is that it calculates the score of each factor within the sampling points davis 1987 two different datasets were used as variables in the fa the first referring to garigliano river plain and comprising hco3 cl f no3 so4 2 na k mg2 ca2 li b v mn ni as sr ba u ec and ph values and the second for florina basin comprising hco3 cl f no3 so4 2 na k mg2 ca2 and ec values 3 3 optimization and validation of groundwater vulnerability the innovative methodology of this research aimed to produce a representative hybrid groundwater vulnerability index svap based on the quantitative hydrogeological parameters that were validated according to the aquifer s hydrogeochemical process hence seven of the most commonly used rating parameters were selected and combined for use within the svap rating model similar to other existing methods the model estimates vertical groundwater vulnerability with the following assumptions the pollutant is introduced at the ground surface the contaminant reaches the groundwater table by precipitation infiltration the contaminant has the same mobility velocity as water the following parameters were included in the model 3 3 1 depth to the water table this parameter represents the thickness of the unsaturated zone and is usually considered one of the most important parameters when studying groundwater quality degradation it determines the distance that infiltrating water travels through the unsaturated material above the aquifer low values of depth to the water table can indicate that groundwater is highly susceptible to contamination as the closer the groundwater is to the ground surface the higher the possibility of its becoming polluted by one or more contaminants and vice versa 3 3 2 los indices the los indices aschonitis et al 2012 were used to determine both recharge of the aquifer and nitrogen losses nitrogen losses are a quantitative parameter in contrast to the qualitative approach of soil type that other methods use the two parameters of water losw and nitrogen losn losses through percolation p and runoff r are estimated through the following equations 1 l o s w a 1 k s i a 2 s i a 3 p c p i a 4 p e i a 5 i r i 2 2 l o s n a 1 o m i a 2 t i a 3 k s i a 4 s i a 5 p c p i a 6 p e i a 7 i r i 2 where losw denotes water losses mm y losn denotes n losses kg ha y ks is the hydraulic conductivity of soil mm d s is the surface slope pcp is the precipitation mm y pe is the potential evapotranspiration mm y ir is the irrigation applied by the model mm y om is the organic matter content and t is the mean annual temperature c 3 3 3 hydraulic resistance avi the avi method expresses the hydraulic resistance c a theoretical factor used to describe the resistance of the vadose zone to vertical flow 3 c σdi ki where d represents the thickness of each sedimentary layer above the saturated aquifer surface and k is the hydraulic conductivity of each of these sedimentary layers hydraulic resistance c provides the relative time duration that pollutants travel through the unsaturated zone 3 3 4 aquifer thickness this parameter is crucial to determine the no3 dilution potential of groundwater zhong 2005 high values of thickness refer to high dilution and hence lower vulnerability and vice versa 3 3 5 hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer hydraulic conductivity governs the rate at which the groundwater flows and thus also expresses the velocity that contaminants move through the aquifer the higher the hydraulic conductivity of the area the greater the transportation of contaminants will be leading to higher aquifer vulnerability 3 3 5 1 topography slope the impact of topography on groundwater vulnerability refers to the slope of the region and its variability across the area in general a flat topography is responsible for the infiltration of contaminants as the time available for infiltration will be greater while runoff will be the dominant process on a steep slope all data were analysed in a geographic information system gis environment and a raster file was created for each parameter the class range of each parameter was determined using the grading methods of natural breaks equal interval quantile and geometrical intervals the calibration procedure was performed using the factor weight produced by the fa the calibration file was created by following three steps i the chosen anthropogenic factor was interpolated upon the study area with ordinary kriging ii a fishnet point creation was established with a size suitable for the area and iii the interpolated factor was imprinted within each fishnet point with the gis function raster value to point all grading methods were classified from 1 to 10 and the one showing the highest pearson s correlation coefficient r with factor score was chosen table s1 the anthropogenic factor was also used to determine the weight of each parameter instead of using just no3 concentrations as the calibration parameter the proposed methodology introduced the factor weights extracted for each groundwater sample belonging to the pollution factor as identified by fa a single parameters sensitivity analysis sa napolitano and fabbri 1996 was performed for both study areas to estimate the influence of parameter weights on the final product the seven quantitative parameters were overlaid using the map algebra tool and the raster calculator the methodological approach differentiates from previous approaches due to the incorporation of multivariate statistical analysis in the development and validation process of the introduced index the application of the index in two aquifer systems verified the robustness of the proposed approach as well as the necessity to include the hydrogeochemical regime within the vulnerability assessment 4 results 4 1 general hydrogeochemistry of the study area the different hydrogeochemical regimes of the aquifers in garigliano river plain and florina basin are shown in the piper diagrams of fig 3 groundwater samples from florina basin are all plotted on the left side of the diagram suggesting that the main hydrogeochemical facies of this area is calcium bicarbonate hco3 ca some samples tend to the upper part of the diagram representative of the calcium sulphate hco3 ca so4 water type however in this case the increase in so4 2 concentration is not linked to geological conditions but to anthropogenic pressure in fact no3 and so4 2 concentrations in some samples exceed the maximum permissible limit mpl for drinking water according to eu standards directive 2006 118 ec suggesting anthropogenic pollution related to the application of chemical fertilizers and manure in agricultural fields in the garigliano plain the piper diagram highlights different hydrogeochemical processes two main trends are evident the first involves all samples that display increased concentrations of na and cl and is probably connected to seawater intrusion and contact with shallow marine sediments since the rise in na and cl concentrations is also accompanied by an increase in so4 2 and mg2 concentrations the second trend is mainly related to the lithological contact between the hco3 ca type water originating from the southern relief and the plain s volcanic sediments and to the mixing with hco3 na water originating from the roccamonfina volcano in the east both processes are responsible for the observed increase in alkali ion na and k concentrations intensive agricultural activities are widespread in both study areas and consequently high no3 concentrations are observed the different hydrogeochemical regimes of the studied aquifers provide an ideal opportunity to test the applicability of the proposed vulnerability index factor analysis was applied to both datasets to delineate the anthropogenic factor for svap calibration for the garigliano plain three factors emerged from the analysis table s1 with a kmo coefficient of 0 56 over 95 of confidence and with 74 of total variance explained factor 1 takes into consideration ec cl so4 2 na mg2 ca ba and mn accounting for 35 of the total variance and representing the main mineralization process in the studied aquifer paleo and present seawater intrusion are involved i near the mouth of the river garigliano that could indicate a preferential pathway of seawater intrusion kazakis et al 2019 and ii in the centre of the plain where aquifer salinity is due to the presence of shallow marine sediments factor 2 shows a strong correlation between f as li and v these elements are commonly present in volcanic aquifers casentini et al 2010 and therefore factor 2 represents the interaction between groundwater and volcanic sediments this process is more evident far from mt massico fig 3 and reaches highest impact in the area where the plain is fed by groundwater from roccamonfina volcano containing high f concentrations corniello et al 2018 factor 3 highlights the anthropogenic impacts on the study area with the fa linking no3 concentrations to those of u and sr leaching from agricultural soils may transfer no3 and so4 2 and other trace elements present as impurities in fertilizers to groundwater busico et al 2017 as previously reported for phosphate and superphosphate fertilizers where both u and sr have been found in combination with no3 liesch et al 2015 in the florina basin the fa identified four hydrogeological factors table s2 with a kmo coefficient higher than 0 5 factor 1 shows high correlation between ca2 hco3 and ec thus confirming the presence of the hco3 ca facies previously detected in the piper diagram factor 2 refers to a geogenic origin linking k and cl originating from the weathering of feldspars that are present in the surrounding area factors 3 and 4 describe different sources of anthropogenic pollution ascribable to the application of chemical fertilizers and manure over agricultural fields specifically factor 3 links so4 2 mg2 and na while factor 4 represents no3 alone with a medium low correlation with so4 2 both factor analyses highlighted the existence of anthropogenic processes in the study areas these are described by factor 3 in the garigliano plain and by factors 3 and 4 in the florina basin the weights of these factors were subsequently used for the specific vulnerability assessment 4 2 specific vulnerability assessment the complex hydrogeochemical regimes determined in both study areas by the fa analysis hinder robust aquifer vulnerability assessments and assessment robustness is especially endangered when specific vulnerability is considered the first step of the calibration procedure was the interpolation of the chosen calibration factors upon the study areas for the garigliano plain factor 3 fig 4 a was considered while for the florina basin fig 4b a combination of factors 3 and 4 using the highest positive weight of each point was considered to summarize all the anthropogenic processes for both aquifers the areas with the highest loading overlie areas of major agricultural activity calibration of the svap method followed the procedure described in the previous section ratings and classes for the two study areas are shown in table 1 4 2 1 the garigliano river plain parameter definition data were obtained from different sources i climatic data were collected from five meteorological stations over the period 2000 2015 ii soil textures and organic matter were sourced from di gennaro 2002 and the sias project respectively iii data on vadose zone material and aquifer thickness were derived from the interpretation of the stratigraphic logs available in the ispra database iv hydraulic conductivity values k ranging from 0 9 to 0 04 m d were sourced from ducci and sellerino 2013 and v irrigation values were obtained from local authority reports the depth to water table calculated by subtracting the piezometric head from the digital terrain model dtm ranges from 0 1 m high vulnerability near the coastline to 100 0 m very low vulnerability moving inland the aquifer thickness ranges from 4 0 to 34 0 m with the highest values recorded in the volcanic formations tuffs and lavas in the western part of the plain and the lowest ones in the alluvial sediments to the east los indices both losw and losn show values that increase from the centre of the plain to the coastline where the terrain slope is mild and soil textures are coarser finally according to the hydraulic resistance values highest vulnerability occurs in the northern sector where the vadose zone comprises volcanic sediments fig s3 the final formula for the svap method in the garigliano river plain is 4 s v a p 1 86 d 0 07 l w 2 45 n 0 07 l n 3 04 a 1 28 c 1 27 s where d is the depth to water table lw is losw n is hydraulic resistance c ln is losn a is the aquifer thickness c is the hydraulic conductivity and s is the surface slope the weight of each parameter was calculated using the following relationship 5 w r p r p x 10 where rp is the highest pearson s correlation coefficient of the parameter considered the final map generated by the svap application fig 5 a shows very low and low vulnerability zones occurring along the coastline and in the northern sector of the plain following the relief of roccamonfina the low vulnerability identified in the coastal zone despite the lower depth of the water table is mainly due to the confined conditions of the aquifer due to the presence of clay lenses the high and very high vulnerability zones are concentrated in the central part of the plain where intensive agricultural activities are present the positive correlation pearson s r 0 62 of the svap method with no3 concentrations in the aquifer highlights the reliability of the applied methodology 4 2 2 the florina basin for application in the florina basin all hydrogeological hydrological and soil data were obtained from previous studies voudouris et al 2018 this data included meteorological data from four meteorological stations soil maps land use and aquifer hydraulic data the depth of the groundwater table ranges from 0 0 m very high vulnerability in the northern and southern parts of the basin to 33 0 m very low vulnerability in the centre the mean aquifer thickness value is 70 0 m medium vulnerability over most of the area with a maximum of 120 0 m and a minimum of 30 0 m losw and losn follow the morphology of the study area with maximum values observed over the plain and lowest values near the reliefs low values of hydraulic resistance corresponding to higher vulnerability are recorded in the centre of the basin corresponding to a thinning of the vadose zone the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer ranges from 14 to 15 m day in the north where the aquifer is made of pebbles and gravels to 1 2 m day in the south where the aquifer is fine grained fig s4 the final formula for the svap method in the florina basin is 6 s v a p 0 13 d 0 12 l w 7 3 n 0 10 n 2 01 a 0 10 c 0 15 s the weight of each parameter was calculated using equation 5 application of the svap method divides the study area into five classes of vulnerability leading from very low to very high fig 5b high vulnerability is observed mainly in the centre of the basin following the low depth to water table higher aquifer permeability small aquifer thickness and mild topography low vulnerability is detected in the northern and eastern parts of the basin where the hydraulic resistance is higher and the aquifer thickness lower the high correlation with no3 concentration pearson s r 0 75 confirms the reliability of the methodology 4 2 3 sensitivity analysis for the sensitivity analysis of both study areas the effective weight of each parameter was calculated using the following equation 7 w p r p w v x 100 where w is the effective weighting of each parameter pr is the rating value pw is the weighting value and v is the overall value of the applied index for the garigliano plain high weights were assigned for depth to water table hydraulic resistance and aquifer thickness table 2 therefore the specific vulnerability seems to be related mainly to the lithological features of this basin in fact the presence of fractured media tuff and lavas can represent a preferential pathway for contaminant migration the sensitivity analysis also showed that losw and losn have the lowest weight among the considered parameters the vulnerability indices assume that pollutants are introduced into the aquifer from the surface in the case of garigliano the lateral inflow from the surrounding zone to the alluvial aquifer might be significant this identifies one possible drawback of applying such vulnerability indices that should be considered in future studies conversely for the florina basin high weights were assigned to hydraulic resistance and aquifer thickness while the other factors showed low weights of similar magnitude table 2 in this area the characteristics of the vadose and saturated zones seem to have a higher impact than the other parameters these findings verify the importance of hydrogeochemical characterization within a specific vulnerability assessment where knowledge of the different hydrogeological backgrounds leads to a more reliable vulnerability assessment these results also confirm the suitability of the svap methodology in performing a reliable aquifer vulnerability assessment with different datasets 5 discussion groundwater vulnerability mapping may possibly be the most efficient prevention tool against groundwater pollution however in many cases anthropogenic activities overlie vulnerable aquifers and inevitably groundwater is polluted in many cases including the two presented here no evident historical changes in land use can explain the continuous deterioration of groundwater quality in the past land use was determined without considering groundwater vulnerability and hence the crucial question is how useful is a vulnerability map today skeptics of the groundwater vulnerability concept claim that land cover changes would be challenging due to the excessive socio economical cost involved however if highly discretized vulnerability maps could be provided then only focused land cover changes would be necessary undoubtedly the economic cost required for land use change would be more than offset by the environmental benefits α necessary prerequisite for today s groundwater vulnerability maps is their reliability kazakis and voudouris 2015 and reliability increases when the following rules are followed analysis of detailed hydrogeological and hydrological datasets the vulnerability assessment model applied should be validated according to the specific conditions of the aquifer in question the results should be verified using tracers of the site s most dominant pollutant s a valid model for the delineation of groundwater vulnerability zones is critically important to define optimal management strategies klaas et al 2017 no3 concentration has been widely used to verify the results of vulnerability models nevertheless the origin of no3 sources should be considered as it permits a more thorough understanding of a hydro system hosono et al 2013 additionally in many aquifers no3 concentrations are driven by complex and interconnected hydrogeochemical processes that can lead to misleading model validation xin et al 2019 poor validation usually occurs in complex hydrogeochemical environments as revealed by the large range of correlation coefficients between vulnerability and no3 concentration seen in the literature this study does not disregard verification of vulnerability maps using no3 concentrations however the need to account for all anthropogenic pollutants in the validation process should be highlighted for this reason the validation process in this study was tested using the anthropogenic factor incorporating seven quantitative parameters these parameters have been widely used in modified versions of sintacs busico et al 2017 and drastic kazakis and voudouris 2015 nevertheless the highest correlations with no3 concentration were attained in pollution risk maps that also accounted for land use for instance the drastic pa method showed a 0 6 correlation with no3 concentration kazakis and voudouris 2015 while the vulnerability correlation with no3 concentration using sintacs svn method was 0 47 busico et al 2017 additionally previous applications in florina basin detected no correlation between the drastic vulnerability map and no3 concentrations while the risk map showed a correlation of 0 52 voudouris et al 2018 in this study correlations of 0 75 and 0 62 were observed between no3 concentration and vulnerability degree in florina and garigliano basins respectively the obtained correlation in florina basin constitutes the highest within the available literature table s3 clearly when the validation process includes all anthropogenic processes the reliability of the final map increases remarkably additionally the high discretisation of the svap approach renders it suitable for land use changes in small scale agriculture and dispersed crops the novel svap approach is flexible as the method can be adapted to the hydrogeological status of each specific study area while parameters can be added or removed accordingly thus increasing the reliability of groundwater vulnerability assessment feedback from the results of svap application in other sites could reveal potential drawbacks of the suggested approach 6 conclusions a novel hybrid method of specific vulnerability to anthropogenic pollution svap was developed the new svap method accounts for both hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical regimes of an aquifer and incorporates the following methodological steps field hydrological and hydrogeological data are elaborated in a gis environment and seven quantitative thematic maps should be produced multivariate statistical analysis is used to determine the anthropogenic pollution factor the anthropogenic factor scores are used to determine the class range and weight score of each parameter while the weight score is further validated by using single sensitivity analysis the final specific vulnerability map is produced by overlying the seven thematic maps produced from svap application and correlation coefficients can be used to verify the results two case studies were chosen for model evaluation garigliano river plain in italy and florina basin in greece the svap method successfully identified the impact of several hydrochemical processes within the study areas the processes occurring within the garigliano river plain were identified as i actual seawater intrusion near the river mouth and groundwater paleo salinity due to contact with marine sediments ii interaction with igneous sediments and iii anthropogenic impact due to agricultural activities in the florina basin the main processes driving the hydrogeochemistry of the aquifer were identified as i hco3 ca signature ii geogenic contamination of k and cl and iii anthropogenic pollution due to agricultural activities which was represented by two factors in florina basin the two factors connected to anthropogenic activities were combined in order to validate the svap method the recorded correlations of 0 75 and 0 62 between no3 concentration and vulnerability degree in florina and garigliano basins respectively are the highest reported in the available literature future applications of this svap method in other aquifers may highlight the importance of additional hydrogeochemical processes that are absent from the two areas studied here and thus contribute to improved reliability and applicability of this novel

18186,groundwater resources are the main supply of freshwater for human activities however in the last fifty years aquifers have become more susceptible to chemical pollution due to human activities the concept of groundwater vulnerability constitutes a worldwide accepted tool for water protection and planning however the existing methods and modified versions do not account for all the hydrogeochemical processes that drive anthropogenic pollution the hydrogeochemical processes occurring within an aquifer can be determined using multivariate statistical analysis in this study a specific vulnerability method named svap specific vulnerability to anthropogenic pollution is proposed the index is based on seven quantitative parameters depth to groundwater recharge nitrate losses hydraulic resistance of the vadose zone aquifer thickness hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer and slope weights of anthropogenic factors were determined by factor analysis and used to validate the svap methodology the parameters classification was selected according to the highest pearson s correlation coefficient with factor weights and then grouped via a linear combination the new index was applied in two watersheds the florina basin greece and the garigliano river basin italy both of which possess complex hydrogeochemical regimes the main hydrogeochemical processes acting in the study areas were identified via factor analysis which revealed that the anthropogenic pollution in both sites was due mainly to chemical fertilizers and manure verification of the svap method produced correlation coefficients with nitrate concentrations of 0 75 and 0 62 in florina and garigliano respectively the proposed svap method is more reliable and flexible than standard vulnerability assessment methods and can be easily adapted for complex aquifers graphical abstract image 1 keywords factor analysis mineralization processes anthropogenic pollution garigliano plain florina basin groundwater protection 1 introduction groundwater constitutes a crucial and life sustaining resource throughout the world alley et al 2002 half of the world s population depends on groundwater resources for drinking water irrigation domestic and industrial use oki and kanae 2006 additionally groundwater often supports critical ecosystems of surface water bodies however groundwater is being polluted and depleted at both regional and local scales aeschbach hertig and gleeson 2012 decreased groundwater quality is often attributed to the increased and uncontrolled use of chemical compounds while climate change and population growth aggravate this situation razandi et al 2015 agricultural activities such as the application of chemical fertilizers and manure have been identified as the main sources of surface and groundwater pollution since the early twentieth century while nitrate no3 is considered the main pollutant at global scale ascott et al 2017 the use of polluted groundwater may pose risks to human health hence prevention and monitoring have become necessary to guarantee water quality in this framework vulnerability assessment and mapping could be an important tool for the protection and management of groundwater resources vulnerability refers to the possibility that a contaminant shall percolate and diffuse from the ground surface into a groundwater system margat 1968 and can be classified as either intrinsic or specific vulnerability stigter et al 2006 the former defines vulnerability solely as a function of hydrogeological factors and the latter defines vulnerability by the potential impacts of specific land uses and contaminants based on data availability vulnerability mapping can be applied anywhere in the world by focusing on anthropogenic and or geogenic sources of contamination brindha and elango 2015 there are three main approaches to aquifer vulnerability assessment i overlay index methods ii process based simulation models and iii statistical methods national research council 1993 the recent trend in groundwater vulnerability assessment is the combination of these approaches to produce hybrid models that incorporate various data sets a detailed analysis of vulnerability assessment methods is presented in machiwal et al 2018 who concluded that the reliability of a vulnerability map strongly depends on data availability and the experience of the map s creator the most frequently applied rating models in the last thirty years are drastic aller et al 1987 avi van stemproot et al 1993 and sintacs civita and de maio 2004 the choice of the applied method mainly depends on aquifer type e g karst or porous aquifer while data availability should also be considered kazakis et al 2015 it is also crucial to understand the hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical regime of the study area in the mediterranean basin sintacs and sintacs derived methods are the most commonly applied both for intrinsic and specific vulnerability assessment busico et al 2017 matzeu et al 2017 to verify the reliability of a vulnerability assessment no3 concentration in groundwater has been selected as the most common indicator of anthropogenic impact white et al 2013 and is regularly used for the validation of rating models arauzo 2017 elçi 2017 pacheco et al 2015 under natural conditions no3 is not present at high concentrations over 10 mg l in groundwater instead its presence in groundwater usually indicates pollution from anthropogenic activities such as agricultural practices sewage effluents or wastewater from desalination plants singh et al 2015 the plume flow of no3 within an aquifer can be indicative so as to delineate groundwater protection zones and vulnerability maps using spatial variables jang and chen 2015 nevertheless in several applications no correlation between intrinsic vulnerability indexes and no3 concentrations in groundwater has been found lasagna et al 2018 thus showing that it is crucial to adapt the vulnerability index to the hydrogeological characteristics of each study area busico et al 2017 proposed a sintacs modification sintacs svn and sintacs svs where avi and los indices aschonitis et al 2012 together with aquifer thickness replaced initial parameters in order to eliminate subjectivity classes and weights were defined and calibrated using linear correlation with observed no3 and so4 2 concentrations in groundwater and produced more reliable results than the standard sintacs application however no3 and so4 2 are not the only compounds responsible for groundwater pollution and they could be connected to other contaminants such as uranium u and potassium k especially where phosphate fertilizers are employed liesch et al 2015 therefore a validation process using only no3 may lead to incomplete or erroneous conceptual models in this context the understanding of the hydrogeochemical processes governing groundwater quality is a crucial requirement especially in heterogeneous environments in many cases linear correlation between solute species is not sufficient to describe the distribution of contaminants einax et al 1997 and statistical tools like factor analysis fa positive matrix factorization pmf and principal component analysis pca have to be used instead zhang et al 2012 zanotti et al 2019 these techniques examine the relationships between variables and generate a list of significant factors that group the initial variables the interpolation of factor weights using geostatistical tools could be a useful technique to calibrate parameters of the modified vulnerability approaches busico et al 2018 to the best of our knowledge a vulnerability assessment method that integrates hydrogeological with hydrogeochemical processes and multivariate statistical analysis is still missing in the existing literature for example mondal et al 2017 recently applied conventional drastic and verified the vulnerability classification using ionic molar ratio but without incorporating hydrogeochemical characterization within the vulnerability assessment javadi et al 2017 used k means clustering methods to modify drastic by reducing factors and eliminating the use of weights and scores of the parameters no3 chloride and total dissolved solids were used to correlate the vulnerability map this concept is innovative however reducing the involved parameters decreases the holistic representation of the studied system to fill this gap a new process for groundwater vulnerability assessment is introduced in the framework of this study a modified rating method for specific vulnerability to anthropogenic pollution svap was developed and tested following this concept the research was divided into the following stages i identification of the processes acting within the selected study sites following a combined hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical interpretation ii discrimination between geogenic and anthropogenic processes using fa iii construction and testing of the vulnerability assessment with the svap methodology two study areas were selected for this purpose the garigliano river plain southern italy and florina basin north western greece these aquifers are highly suitable to apply and test the proposed methodological approach since in both sites the standard index based methods have already been applied busico et al 2019 voudouris et al 2018 and showed poor correlation with no3 concentration 2 study sites two study areas were chosen for the development and application of the novel vulnerability method accounting for both hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical regimes reliable data concerning geological geomorphological hydrological and climatic characteristics as well as hydrogeochemical hydraulic and geometrical data of the aquifers were available for both sites general site characteristics are described below 2 1 the garigliano river plain the garigliano river plain is located in the northern part of the campania region southern italy fig 1 a the plain is a graben filled with alluvial and volcanic materials namely upper miocene quaternary deposits and continental clastic deposits from the garigliano river and volcano clastic sediments from the roccamonfina volcano ducci and sellerino 2013 it covers an area of 100 km2 and is bordered by the massico relief to the south the garigliano river to the north the tyrrhenian sea to the west and the roccamonfina volcano to the east the main aquifer is unconfined and is hosted in alluvial deposits of volcanic origin inland and in marine deposits towards the coast low hydraulic conductivity lenses of alluvial marshes and lacustrine deposits are present within the main aquifer the climate is mediterranean with a mean annual precipitation for the period 1990 2017 of around 800 mm occurring mainly between october and may the land use is dominated by agricultural fields that cover more than 80 of the territory and by farming activities that are concentrated in the centre of the plain fig s1 highly populated towns are located near the mountain ranges and along the coastline 2 2 the florina basin florina basin is located in western macedonia northern greece and covers an area of 319 km2 fig 1b the mean altitude is 620 m and the topography is almost flat with a slope of 1 5 the study site includes the alluvial aquifer in the lowlands of the basin the climate of the region is continental with a mean annual precipitation for the period 1992 2017 of 472 mm and a mean annual temperature of 12 6 c the rainfall occurs mainly from october to april florina basin is part of the hellenic pelagonian geotectonic zone neogene and quaternary sediments characterize the lowlands of the study area and a multiple aquifer system is developed within these sediments the alluvial unconfined aquifer covers an area of 180 km2 and comprises alternations of sands gravels conglomerates and clays hydraulic conductivity ranges between 3 10 3 m s and 4 10 6 m s groundwater depth ranges from less than 1 m to more than 45 m below ground surface and the main direction of groundwater flow is from s to n the water demands of this area are mainly covered by the exploitation of groundwater via numerous wells located in the alluvial aquifer voudouris et al 2018 the land use is dominated by agricultural fields that cover the majority of the basin fig s2 3 materials and methods the development of a new hybrid method for vulnerability assessment requires detailed hydrogeological research including the collection and analysis of hydraulic data lithological profiles and aquifer water level measurements hence the conceptualization of the hydro system can be obtained in this study the hydrogeochemical regime was also incorporated into the vulnerability concept and the detailed evaluation of hydrogeochemical data was obtained based on multivariate statistical analysis results of the factor analysis were used for model development and validation a flow chart of the methodological process is shown in fig 2 3 1 data sampling and analysis the hydrogeological data were obtained from previous studies whereas chemical analysis of groundwater and water level measurements were performed for both study sites data on aquifer structure and material were obtained from the analysis of geological maps and lithological profiles of boreholes pumping tests were performed to determine the hydraulic parameters of both aquifers particle size analysis and falling head tests were performed in soils and the vadose zones to determine soil texture hydraulic conductivity and organic matter content the climatic variables of rainfall temperature and evapotranspiration were used to estimate recharge digital elevation models were obtained from digitized topographic maps resulting in a high resolution cell size of 5 5 m in the dry period of 2016 forty three 43 groundwater samples were collected from the agricultural and domestic wells located in the alluvial plain of garigliano river and thirty 30 samples were taken from florina basin in both cases all wells are located within the shallow unconfined aquifer electrical conductivity temperature and ph values were measured in the field major ions ca2 mg2 na k so4 2 no3 were determined by ion chromatography ic a 100 ml aliquot of each sample intended for hco3 measurement was titrated three times with certified 0 1 mol l hcl ionic error balance for all analysed samples did not exceed 5 trace elements with concentrations higher than the detection limit fe mn zn b v li u cr ba sr as and ni were also determined for the garigliano plain using an agilent 7500 ce icp ms with intact interference reaction cell accuracy was verified following epa method 2008 and the relative percentage error was recorded as less than 7 3 2 statistical analysis factor analysis fa is an efficient multivariate statistical tool that can reduce many variables into fewer numbers of factors that describe all the hydrogeochemical processes occurring within an investigated area voudouris et al 1997 fa extracts the maximum common variance from all variables and allocates them a common score the relationship of each variable to the underlying factor is expressed by the factor loading the level of meaningfulness is given by the kaiser meyer olkin kmo parameter that must be higher than 0 5 voudouris et al 2000 in this study r type fa was used to extract all the hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical processes characterizing the initial datasets while pearson s correlation coefficient r between factor weights and parameters was used to calibrate the vulnerability assessment the main advantage of using fa is that it calculates the score of each factor within the sampling points davis 1987 two different datasets were used as variables in the fa the first referring to garigliano river plain and comprising hco3 cl f no3 so4 2 na k mg2 ca2 li b v mn ni as sr ba u ec and ph values and the second for florina basin comprising hco3 cl f no3 so4 2 na k mg2 ca2 and ec values 3 3 optimization and validation of groundwater vulnerability the innovative methodology of this research aimed to produce a representative hybrid groundwater vulnerability index svap based on the quantitative hydrogeological parameters that were validated according to the aquifer s hydrogeochemical process hence seven of the most commonly used rating parameters were selected and combined for use within the svap rating model similar to other existing methods the model estimates vertical groundwater vulnerability with the following assumptions the pollutant is introduced at the ground surface the contaminant reaches the groundwater table by precipitation infiltration the contaminant has the same mobility velocity as water the following parameters were included in the model 3 3 1 depth to the water table this parameter represents the thickness of the unsaturated zone and is usually considered one of the most important parameters when studying groundwater quality degradation it determines the distance that infiltrating water travels through the unsaturated material above the aquifer low values of depth to the water table can indicate that groundwater is highly susceptible to contamination as the closer the groundwater is to the ground surface the higher the possibility of its becoming polluted by one or more contaminants and vice versa 3 3 2 los indices the los indices aschonitis et al 2012 were used to determine both recharge of the aquifer and nitrogen losses nitrogen losses are a quantitative parameter in contrast to the qualitative approach of soil type that other methods use the two parameters of water losw and nitrogen losn losses through percolation p and runoff r are estimated through the following equations 1 l o s w a 1 k s i a 2 s i a 3 p c p i a 4 p e i a 5 i r i 2 2 l o s n a 1 o m i a 2 t i a 3 k s i a 4 s i a 5 p c p i a 6 p e i a 7 i r i 2 where losw denotes water losses mm y losn denotes n losses kg ha y ks is the hydraulic conductivity of soil mm d s is the surface slope pcp is the precipitation mm y pe is the potential evapotranspiration mm y ir is the irrigation applied by the model mm y om is the organic matter content and t is the mean annual temperature c 3 3 3 hydraulic resistance avi the avi method expresses the hydraulic resistance c a theoretical factor used to describe the resistance of the vadose zone to vertical flow 3 c σdi ki where d represents the thickness of each sedimentary layer above the saturated aquifer surface and k is the hydraulic conductivity of each of these sedimentary layers hydraulic resistance c provides the relative time duration that pollutants travel through the unsaturated zone 3 3 4 aquifer thickness this parameter is crucial to determine the no3 dilution potential of groundwater zhong 2005 high values of thickness refer to high dilution and hence lower vulnerability and vice versa 3 3 5 hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer hydraulic conductivity governs the rate at which the groundwater flows and thus also expresses the velocity that contaminants move through the aquifer the higher the hydraulic conductivity of the area the greater the transportation of contaminants will be leading to higher aquifer vulnerability 3 3 5 1 topography slope the impact of topography on groundwater vulnerability refers to the slope of the region and its variability across the area in general a flat topography is responsible for the infiltration of contaminants as the time available for infiltration will be greater while runoff will be the dominant process on a steep slope all data were analysed in a geographic information system gis environment and a raster file was created for each parameter the class range of each parameter was determined using the grading methods of natural breaks equal interval quantile and geometrical intervals the calibration procedure was performed using the factor weight produced by the fa the calibration file was created by following three steps i the chosen anthropogenic factor was interpolated upon the study area with ordinary kriging ii a fishnet point creation was established with a size suitable for the area and iii the interpolated factor was imprinted within each fishnet point with the gis function raster value to point all grading methods were classified from 1 to 10 and the one showing the highest pearson s correlation coefficient r with factor score was chosen table s1 the anthropogenic factor was also used to determine the weight of each parameter instead of using just no3 concentrations as the calibration parameter the proposed methodology introduced the factor weights extracted for each groundwater sample belonging to the pollution factor as identified by fa a single parameters sensitivity analysis sa napolitano and fabbri 1996 was performed for both study areas to estimate the influence of parameter weights on the final product the seven quantitative parameters were overlaid using the map algebra tool and the raster calculator the methodological approach differentiates from previous approaches due to the incorporation of multivariate statistical analysis in the development and validation process of the introduced index the application of the index in two aquifer systems verified the robustness of the proposed approach as well as the necessity to include the hydrogeochemical regime within the vulnerability assessment 4 results 4 1 general hydrogeochemistry of the study area the different hydrogeochemical regimes of the aquifers in garigliano river plain and florina basin are shown in the piper diagrams of fig 3 groundwater samples from florina basin are all plotted on the left side of the diagram suggesting that the main hydrogeochemical facies of this area is calcium bicarbonate hco3 ca some samples tend to the upper part of the diagram representative of the calcium sulphate hco3 ca so4 water type however in this case the increase in so4 2 concentration is not linked to geological conditions but to anthropogenic pressure in fact no3 and so4 2 concentrations in some samples exceed the maximum permissible limit mpl for drinking water according to eu standards directive 2006 118 ec suggesting anthropogenic pollution related to the application of chemical fertilizers and manure in agricultural fields in the garigliano plain the piper diagram highlights different hydrogeochemical processes two main trends are evident the first involves all samples that display increased concentrations of na and cl and is probably connected to seawater intrusion and contact with shallow marine sediments since the rise in na and cl concentrations is also accompanied by an increase in so4 2 and mg2 concentrations the second trend is mainly related to the lithological contact between the hco3 ca type water originating from the southern relief and the plain s volcanic sediments and to the mixing with hco3 na water originating from the roccamonfina volcano in the east both processes are responsible for the observed increase in alkali ion na and k concentrations intensive agricultural activities are widespread in both study areas and consequently high no3 concentrations are observed the different hydrogeochemical regimes of the studied aquifers provide an ideal opportunity to test the applicability of the proposed vulnerability index factor analysis was applied to both datasets to delineate the anthropogenic factor for svap calibration for the garigliano plain three factors emerged from the analysis table s1 with a kmo coefficient of 0 56 over 95 of confidence and with 74 of total variance explained factor 1 takes into consideration ec cl so4 2 na mg2 ca ba and mn accounting for 35 of the total variance and representing the main mineralization process in the studied aquifer paleo and present seawater intrusion are involved i near the mouth of the river garigliano that could indicate a preferential pathway of seawater intrusion kazakis et al 2019 and ii in the centre of the plain where aquifer salinity is due to the presence of shallow marine sediments factor 2 shows a strong correlation between f as li and v these elements are commonly present in volcanic aquifers casentini et al 2010 and therefore factor 2 represents the interaction between groundwater and volcanic sediments this process is more evident far from mt massico fig 3 and reaches highest impact in the area where the plain is fed by groundwater from roccamonfina volcano containing high f concentrations corniello et al 2018 factor 3 highlights the anthropogenic impacts on the study area with the fa linking no3 concentrations to those of u and sr leaching from agricultural soils may transfer no3 and so4 2 and other trace elements present as impurities in fertilizers to groundwater busico et al 2017 as previously reported for phosphate and superphosphate fertilizers where both u and sr have been found in combination with no3 liesch et al 2015 in the florina basin the fa identified four hydrogeological factors table s2 with a kmo coefficient higher than 0 5 factor 1 shows high correlation between ca2 hco3 and ec thus confirming the presence of the hco3 ca facies previously detected in the piper diagram factor 2 refers to a geogenic origin linking k and cl originating from the weathering of feldspars that are present in the surrounding area factors 3 and 4 describe different sources of anthropogenic pollution ascribable to the application of chemical fertilizers and manure over agricultural fields specifically factor 3 links so4 2 mg2 and na while factor 4 represents no3 alone with a medium low correlation with so4 2 both factor analyses highlighted the existence of anthropogenic processes in the study areas these are described by factor 3 in the garigliano plain and by factors 3 and 4 in the florina basin the weights of these factors were subsequently used for the specific vulnerability assessment 4 2 specific vulnerability assessment the complex hydrogeochemical regimes determined in both study areas by the fa analysis hinder robust aquifer vulnerability assessments and assessment robustness is especially endangered when specific vulnerability is considered the first step of the calibration procedure was the interpolation of the chosen calibration factors upon the study areas for the garigliano plain factor 3 fig 4 a was considered while for the florina basin fig 4b a combination of factors 3 and 4 using the highest positive weight of each point was considered to summarize all the anthropogenic processes for both aquifers the areas with the highest loading overlie areas of major agricultural activity calibration of the svap method followed the procedure described in the previous section ratings and classes for the two study areas are shown in table 1 4 2 1 the garigliano river plain parameter definition data were obtained from different sources i climatic data were collected from five meteorological stations over the period 2000 2015 ii soil textures and organic matter were sourced from di gennaro 2002 and the sias project respectively iii data on vadose zone material and aquifer thickness were derived from the interpretation of the stratigraphic logs available in the ispra database iv hydraulic conductivity values k ranging from 0 9 to 0 04 m d were sourced from ducci and sellerino 2013 and v irrigation values were obtained from local authority reports the depth to water table calculated by subtracting the piezometric head from the digital terrain model dtm ranges from 0 1 m high vulnerability near the coastline to 100 0 m very low vulnerability moving inland the aquifer thickness ranges from 4 0 to 34 0 m with the highest values recorded in the volcanic formations tuffs and lavas in the western part of the plain and the lowest ones in the alluvial sediments to the east los indices both losw and losn show values that increase from the centre of the plain to the coastline where the terrain slope is mild and soil textures are coarser finally according to the hydraulic resistance values highest vulnerability occurs in the northern sector where the vadose zone comprises volcanic sediments fig s3 the final formula for the svap method in the garigliano river plain is 4 s v a p 1 86 d 0 07 l w 2 45 n 0 07 l n 3 04 a 1 28 c 1 27 s where d is the depth to water table lw is losw n is hydraulic resistance c ln is losn a is the aquifer thickness c is the hydraulic conductivity and s is the surface slope the weight of each parameter was calculated using the following relationship 5 w r p r p x 10 where rp is the highest pearson s correlation coefficient of the parameter considered the final map generated by the svap application fig 5 a shows very low and low vulnerability zones occurring along the coastline and in the northern sector of the plain following the relief of roccamonfina the low vulnerability identified in the coastal zone despite the lower depth of the water table is mainly due to the confined conditions of the aquifer due to the presence of clay lenses the high and very high vulnerability zones are concentrated in the central part of the plain where intensive agricultural activities are present the positive correlation pearson s r 0 62 of the svap method with no3 concentrations in the aquifer highlights the reliability of the applied methodology 4 2 2 the florina basin for application in the florina basin all hydrogeological hydrological and soil data were obtained from previous studies voudouris et al 2018 this data included meteorological data from four meteorological stations soil maps land use and aquifer hydraulic data the depth of the groundwater table ranges from 0 0 m very high vulnerability in the northern and southern parts of the basin to 33 0 m very low vulnerability in the centre the mean aquifer thickness value is 70 0 m medium vulnerability over most of the area with a maximum of 120 0 m and a minimum of 30 0 m losw and losn follow the morphology of the study area with maximum values observed over the plain and lowest values near the reliefs low values of hydraulic resistance corresponding to higher vulnerability are recorded in the centre of the basin corresponding to a thinning of the vadose zone the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer ranges from 14 to 15 m day in the north where the aquifer is made of pebbles and gravels to 1 2 m day in the south where the aquifer is fine grained fig s4 the final formula for the svap method in the florina basin is 6 s v a p 0 13 d 0 12 l w 7 3 n 0 10 n 2 01 a 0 10 c 0 15 s the weight of each parameter was calculated using equation 5 application of the svap method divides the study area into five classes of vulnerability leading from very low to very high fig 5b high vulnerability is observed mainly in the centre of the basin following the low depth to water table higher aquifer permeability small aquifer thickness and mild topography low vulnerability is detected in the northern and eastern parts of the basin where the hydraulic resistance is higher and the aquifer thickness lower the high correlation with no3 concentration pearson s r 0 75 confirms the reliability of the methodology 4 2 3 sensitivity analysis for the sensitivity analysis of both study areas the effective weight of each parameter was calculated using the following equation 7 w p r p w v x 100 where w is the effective weighting of each parameter pr is the rating value pw is the weighting value and v is the overall value of the applied index for the garigliano plain high weights were assigned for depth to water table hydraulic resistance and aquifer thickness table 2 therefore the specific vulnerability seems to be related mainly to the lithological features of this basin in fact the presence of fractured media tuff and lavas can represent a preferential pathway for contaminant migration the sensitivity analysis also showed that losw and losn have the lowest weight among the considered parameters the vulnerability indices assume that pollutants are introduced into the aquifer from the surface in the case of garigliano the lateral inflow from the surrounding zone to the alluvial aquifer might be significant this identifies one possible drawback of applying such vulnerability indices that should be considered in future studies conversely for the florina basin high weights were assigned to hydraulic resistance and aquifer thickness while the other factors showed low weights of similar magnitude table 2 in this area the characteristics of the vadose and saturated zones seem to have a higher impact than the other parameters these findings verify the importance of hydrogeochemical characterization within a specific vulnerability assessment where knowledge of the different hydrogeological backgrounds leads to a more reliable vulnerability assessment these results also confirm the suitability of the svap methodology in performing a reliable aquifer vulnerability assessment with different datasets 5 discussion groundwater vulnerability mapping may possibly be the most efficient prevention tool against groundwater pollution however in many cases anthropogenic activities overlie vulnerable aquifers and inevitably groundwater is polluted in many cases including the two presented here no evident historical changes in land use can explain the continuous deterioration of groundwater quality in the past land use was determined without considering groundwater vulnerability and hence the crucial question is how useful is a vulnerability map today skeptics of the groundwater vulnerability concept claim that land cover changes would be challenging due to the excessive socio economical cost involved however if highly discretized vulnerability maps could be provided then only focused land cover changes would be necessary undoubtedly the economic cost required for land use change would be more than offset by the environmental benefits α necessary prerequisite for today s groundwater vulnerability maps is their reliability kazakis and voudouris 2015 and reliability increases when the following rules are followed analysis of detailed hydrogeological and hydrological datasets the vulnerability assessment model applied should be validated according to the specific conditions of the aquifer in question the results should be verified using tracers of the site s most dominant pollutant s a valid model for the delineation of groundwater vulnerability zones is critically important to define optimal management strategies klaas et al 2017 no3 concentration has been widely used to verify the results of vulnerability models nevertheless the origin of no3 sources should be considered as it permits a more thorough understanding of a hydro system hosono et al 2013 additionally in many aquifers no3 concentrations are driven by complex and interconnected hydrogeochemical processes that can lead to misleading model validation xin et al 2019 poor validation usually occurs in complex hydrogeochemical environments as revealed by the large range of correlation coefficients between vulnerability and no3 concentration seen in the literature this study does not disregard verification of vulnerability maps using no3 concentrations however the need to account for all anthropogenic pollutants in the validation process should be highlighted for this reason the validation process in this study was tested using the anthropogenic factor incorporating seven quantitative parameters these parameters have been widely used in modified versions of sintacs busico et al 2017 and drastic kazakis and voudouris 2015 nevertheless the highest correlations with no3 concentration were attained in pollution risk maps that also accounted for land use for instance the drastic pa method showed a 0 6 correlation with no3 concentration kazakis and voudouris 2015 while the vulnerability correlation with no3 concentration using sintacs svn method was 0 47 busico et al 2017 additionally previous applications in florina basin detected no correlation between the drastic vulnerability map and no3 concentrations while the risk map showed a correlation of 0 52 voudouris et al 2018 in this study correlations of 0 75 and 0 62 were observed between no3 concentration and vulnerability degree in florina and garigliano basins respectively the obtained correlation in florina basin constitutes the highest within the available literature table s3 clearly when the validation process includes all anthropogenic processes the reliability of the final map increases remarkably additionally the high discretisation of the svap approach renders it suitable for land use changes in small scale agriculture and dispersed crops the novel svap approach is flexible as the method can be adapted to the hydrogeological status of each specific study area while parameters can be added or removed accordingly thus increasing the reliability of groundwater vulnerability assessment feedback from the results of svap application in other sites could reveal potential drawbacks of the suggested approach 6 conclusions a novel hybrid method of specific vulnerability to anthropogenic pollution svap was developed the new svap method accounts for both hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical regimes of an aquifer and incorporates the following methodological steps field hydrological and hydrogeological data are elaborated in a gis environment and seven quantitative thematic maps should be produced multivariate statistical analysis is used to determine the anthropogenic pollution factor the anthropogenic factor scores are used to determine the class range and weight score of each parameter while the weight score is further validated by using single sensitivity analysis the final specific vulnerability map is produced by overlying the seven thematic maps produced from svap application and correlation coefficients can be used to verify the results two case studies were chosen for model evaluation garigliano river plain in italy and florina basin in greece the svap method successfully identified the impact of several hydrochemical processes within the study areas the processes occurring within the garigliano river plain were identified as i actual seawater intrusion near the river mouth and groundwater paleo salinity due to contact with marine sediments ii interaction with igneous sediments and iii anthropogenic impact due to agricultural activities in the florina basin the main processes driving the hydrogeochemistry of the aquifer were identified as i hco3 ca signature ii geogenic contamination of k and cl and iii anthropogenic pollution due to agricultural activities which was represented by two factors in florina basin the two factors connected to anthropogenic activities were combined in order to validate the svap method the recorded correlations of 0 75 and 0 62 between no3 concentration and vulnerability degree in florina and garigliano basins respectively are the highest reported in the available literature future applications of this svap method in other aquifers may highlight the importance of additional hydrogeochemical processes that are absent from the two areas studied here and thus contribute to improved reliability and applicability of this novel

18187,the efficient recovery of heavy metals from complexed wastewater is an essential but challenging task in this study a novel low fe iii driven uv air process lfua was developed to break the strong complexation between ethylenediamine tetracetic acid edta and heavy metal ions hmis and enable the enhanced recovery of hmis via chelating resin adsorption cra the inside mechanism of the lfua process includes 1 displacement of hmis from hmi edta complexes by fe iii 2 direct photolysis of fe iii edta through a ligand to metal charge transition reaction lmct and indirect photolysis of edta by ho2 o2 the iron dosage was orders of magnitude lower than that previously reported due to the fe ii fe iii redox cycle in the lfua process fe ii formed during the lmct reaction of fe iii edta was oxidized back to fe iii by o2 and ho2 and the reformed fe iii was then recombined with edta to sustains the lmct reaction edta was completely removed in 20 min at a molar ratio of fe iii edta 0 05 in addition following the lfua process the adsorption amounts of various hmis onto d463 resin were at least two orders of magnitude higher than those reported using the direct adsorption process employing the integrated technique of lfua cra enabled the efficient removal of up to 64 5 mg l of cu ii from inlet wastewater and residual cu ii was below 0 5 mg l the results of desorption experiments showed that over 90 of cu ii was recovered and the desorption solution had a cu concentration of 2 1 g l and purity of 99 furthermore the economic and practical feasibility of using the combined process of lfua cra was analyzed to substantiate that the technique is highly efficient and clean produces no harmful sludge therefore it is an appropriate and practical process in removing hmis edta complexes and recovering hmis from wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords heavy metal ions recovery edta complex iron cycle 1 introduction heavy metal ions hmis in wastewater can have a detrimental impact on human health and their collection is of value with respect to their potential application in industry therefore their removal and recovery has attracted considerable research attention ko et al 2018 xu et al 2015b ethylenediamine tetracetic acid edta is a commonly used chelating agent that is widely used in the electroplating textile and battery industries song et al 2019 wang et al 2019a b however edta can form stable complexes with various hmis over a wide ph range and this dramatically reduces the hmi removal efficiency when employed with conventional technologies such as chemical precipitation ion exchange and membrane separation balladares et al 2018 dabrowski et al 2004 sunil et al 2018 ma et al 2009 in the past decades various technologies have been developed to treat edta complexed hmis yu et al 2017 guan et al 2015 and previous works have focused on the following two strategies destructive and non destructive methods destructive methods involve destroying edta using advanced oxidation processes aops such as fenton and photochemical oxidation prior to employing subsequent chemical precipitation to remove the hmis song et al 2019 ye et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 however aops based on ho and so4 are sensitive to coexisting inorganic anions xu et al 2017 huang et al 2019 in addition the high consumption of oxidants and the further need to treat the heavy metal sludge make these treatment processes costly non destructive methods involve the removal of complexed hmis using adsorption technologies yan et al 2019 li et al 2019 they have been proven to be simple and environmentally friendly for recovering hmis and they avoid the formation of harmful heavy metal sludges however edta has an inhibitive effect on the adsorption process and him edta complexes often remain in the desorption solution which limits the subsequent reuse of hmis yan et al 2019 repo et al 2013 it is thus important to develop a new and effective technology to realize the deep removal and recycling of edta complexed hmis the stability constant of fe iii with edta is several orders of magnitude higher than that of most typical hmis fe iii carboxylate complexes are photochemically reactive and could go through ligand to metal charge transfer lmct reaction eq 1 to result in the direct decomposition of carboxylates nowack et al 1996 ling et al 2017 in this respect a combined uv fe iii oh process was recently proposed to treat complexed hmis xu et al 2015b ye et al 2017 sun et al 2019 shan et al 2018 however its high consumption of fe iii mole ratio fe iii cu ii 4 not only limits the reaction conditions to an extremely acidic stage but also produces a large amount of iron sludge which then increases subsequent treatment costs besides it is difficult to recycle hmis in the presence of such a high iron concentration because sediments form during the irradiation process therefore a cost effective and environmentally friendly process should be developed to reduce dosage consumption and also avoid possible secondary pollution while recovering hmis it has been reported that the existence of the fe ii fe iii redox cycle during the photochemical reduction of cr vi in the presence of fe iii organic carboxylic acids marinho et al 2016 we have since found that fe ii generated during the lmct process can be retransformed into fe iii through the fe ii fe iii photochemical cycle when there is an electron scavenger in the wastewater and the iron cycle in reaction process could maintain the lmct reaction without the need for a high iron dosage it has been proved oxygen can serve as electron scavenger nevertheless the role of oxygen in an lmct reaction involving the fe iii carboxylate has not yet been reported 1 f e i i i l h v f e i i l where l and l means carboxylates and carbon centered organic radicals derived from the decarboxylation of carbonates respectively we thus propose the use of a combined process involving lfua process driven hmi edta decomplexation and subsequent hmis separation using chelating resin adsorption cra where air is introduced to reduce the fe iii dosage and promote the fe ii fe iii redox cycle during the irradiation process chelating resins are used to recover hmis because of their good extraction capacity and commercial applications using cu ii edta as a model compound several important parameters of the lfua process were optimized and the inside mechanisms were elucidated in detail an economic analysis and a practicality assessment of the combined process were also conducted 2

electromechanical plant china 100 300 and 500 w medium pressure hg lamps as well as a 500 w xenon lamp were used as light sources the lfua process in the photoreactor mainly involved three steps 1 a selected volume of 0 1 m fe no3 3 stock solution and 10 ml of cu ii edta stock solution containing 0 1 m cu ii and 0 2 m edta were mixed and then diluted to 1 l and 400 ml of the above ph adjusted

process compared to direct adsorption process fig 1 a and this occurred because the structure of edta was destroyed during the lfua process d463 was employed to test the efficiency of the lfua process

shown in fig 1b control experiments were also conducted in this respect and direct adsorption was found to be negligible as expected which indicates that edta competed with the ligands on the resin to bind the hmis hmi adsorption was barely enhanced when using the fe iii air treatment which is possibly due to the poor degradation of edta although it has been reported that fe iii can displace hmis from hmi edta complexes xu et al 2015a b shan et al 2018 the concentration of fe iii was only one tenth of that of the hmis during the lfua process therefore sufficient amounts of hmis to be released via fe iii displacement was difficult similarly the uv air process barely enhanced the adsorption amounts of hmis and this occurred because the photoactivity of hmi edta complexes was far lower than that of the fe iii edta complex xu et al 2017 however the adsorption amounts of hmis were comparatively elevated after using the fe iii uv process which confirms the better synergetic effect of fe iii and uv in fact edta was decomposed completely after the lfua process which resulted in a sharp reduction in the chelation ability of the liquid phase and the ligands on the resin successfully captured the hmis these excellent results validated the broad spectrum of the lfua process for simplification cu ii edta was chosen as the model pollutant in the process used to optimize and explore the mechanism and the results are reported in the following sections 3 2 parameter optimization of lfua process 3 2 1 effect of fe iii dosage the effect of the fe iii dosage on removal of the cu ii edta complex was evaluated and fig 2 a shows the residual edta proportion as a function of reaction time under different fe iii dosages the decomposition process under different concentrations of fe iii fits well with pseudo first order kinetics equations eq 3 3 d e d t a d t k a p p e d t a as shown in table 1 kapp significantly increased from 0 0064 min 1 to 0 3481 min 1 when the fe iii concentration was increased from 0 mm mole ratio fe iii edta 0 to 2 mm mole ratio fe iii edta 1 0 table s2 shows that use of the lfua process promoted the decomposition kinetics of the cu ii edta complex compared with other decomplexation techniques such as use of uv persulfate uv h2o2 and the electro fenton process it was noted that kapp remained almost unchanged when the mole ratio of fe iii edta exceeded 0 25 inset of fig 2a and it was considered this was related to the formation of iron hydroxide and colloid which influenced both the dissolved iron concentration and the transmittance of the solution this postulation was validated by the turbidity of the reaction system which exponentially increased from 0 ftu to 15 8 ftu when the mole ratio of fe iii edta increased from 0 to 2 as shown in fig s2 in addition toc removal was augmented slightly at a higher fe iii dosage fig s3 above all the optimum mole ratio of fe iii edta was set as 0 05 3 2 2 effect of ph as hmi edta complexes contained wastewater are discharged at different ph values huang et al 2019 rekab et al 2014 it is useful to assess the effects of initial ph on the lfua process therefore the influence of initial ph on the removal efficiency of edta was examined at a ph range between 3 and 9 fig 2b and fig s4 shows the distributions of fe iii edta species at different ph values calculated by minteq 3 1 the significant deterioration in the removal efficiency under higher ph values can be attributed to the transformation of the fe iii edta species at ph 3 6 fe iii edta was the major species of fe iii edta but at ph values higher than 6 0 fe iii ohedta2 gradually increased and became the main form the higher degradation rate at relatively low ph values could have been caused by the enhanced production of the reactive species it is of note that the reaction rates at ph 3 0 6 0 were almost the same as those at the initial rate however after the reaction had proceeded for 5 min the rates at ph 4 0 6 0 began to decline which could be ascribed to the spontaneous rise in ph during the lfua process the lfua process consumes hydrogen which is shown by the balanced ph of the mixed solution following photolysis fig s5 it is thus possible that the degradation rate of edta at ph 4 6 was lower than at ph 3 because of the easier increase in ph when the same amount of hydrogen was consumed in addition it has been reported that ho2 o2 plays an important role in the fe ii fe iii cycle therefore ho2 o2 equilibrium in the lfua process should favor ho2 because the ph during this process is lower than 4 86 used in eq 4 xu et al 2017 faust and zepp 1993 ho2 promotes the fe ii fe iii redox cycle through eqs 5 and 6 however the reaction rate constant of eq 5 is obviously higher than that of eq 6 which indicates that ho2 is also beneficial to the formation of fe iii and results in the formation of h2o2 if the ph of the solution is higher than 4 68 ho2 o2 equilibrium will favor o2 which is not be beneficial for the conversion of fe ii to fe iii eqs 7 and 8 ou et al 2008 based on this analysis the optimum initial ph of the lfua process was set as 3 0 4 o 2 h h o 2 5 f e i i h o 2 h f e i i i h 2 o 2 2 o h k 1 2 10 6 m 1 s 1 6 f e i i i h o 2 f e i i o 2 h k 1 10 3 m 1 s 1 7 f e i i o 2 2 h f e i i i h 2 o 2 k 1 0 10 7 m 1 s 1 8 f e i i i o 2 2 h f e i i o 2 k 1 5 10 8 m 1 s 1 3 2 3 effect of irradiation source photodegradation of edta with 100 w 300 w and 500 w hg lamps as well as a 500 w xenon lamp is shown in fig 2c the concentration of edta decreased by only 19 after 30 min using the simulated solar light xenon lamp li et al 2011 wang et al 2019a b owing to low absorbance of the fe iii edta complex in the visible range in contrast the degradation of edta was significantly promoted under irradiation with the hg lamps and the reaction time required for complete edta degradation was reduced from over 30 min 15 min and 10 min when the power was elevated from 100 w to 300 w and 500 w respectively therefore the 300 w hg lamp was selected as the optimum light source 3 2 4 effect of inorganic anions anions including so4 2 cl and no3 were added to test the practical applicability of the proposed decomplexation process xu et al 2017 showed that the addition of cl and no3 both inhibited degradation of cu ii edta in a uv h2o2 system however as shown in fig 2d and 20 mm of coexisting anions had little effect on the decomposition of edta in the lfua process these opposing results can possibly be explained by that the peak sensitivity of the uv lamp used in the lfua process was 365 nm instead of 254 nm in the previous report which would have made it difficult to excite cl and no3 to form free chlorine and nitrite and thus suppress the reaction process 3 3 recovery of cu by cra process 3 3 1 fixed bed dynamic adsorption as seen from fig 1a the cu adsorption capacities of papy and d463 exceeded those of the other two tested chelating resins to investigate the applicability of papy and d463 resins for effectively removing and recovering cu from the irradiated solution breakthrough curves for the simultaneous adsorption of cu and fe onto papy and d463 were determined characterizations of the optimized resins papy and d463 are supplied in text s4 fig s6 and tables s3 s4 as shown in fig 3 a and c the increasing concentrations of cu and fe in the outlet water ensured gradual saturation of the resins fe reached saturation point cout let 0 9c0 quickly for papy whereas the concentration of fe in the outlet water increased slowly for d463 however the cu concentrations in the effluent increased slowly for both resins these results can be explained by differences in the distribution coefficients kd and separation factors α between cu and fe when using papy and d463 text s5 a higher kd is an index of the potential mobility of metals represents stronger sorption onto resins fig s7 shows that the kd of cu is higher for both papy and d463 compared to fe however the separation factors αcu fe for papy and d463 which were calculated by the ratio of the distribution coefficients of cu and fe were 12314 7 and 3 9 respectively therefore the selective uptake of cu by papy was much higher than that by d463 as shown in fig 3b and d the cu concentrations detected in the effluent were below 0 5 mg l before 130 bv for papy resin and 80 bv for d463 resin respectively it thus appears that the d463 resin could be used with the standard discharge of both cu and fe within 80 bv feed solution however papy achieved a high purity recovery of cu therefore the low concentration of fe in the effluent could be easily removed by subsequent resin adsorption the results imply that papy is the most effective chelating resin for use in recovering cu ii from irradiated wastewater 3 3 2 resin regeneration and cu recovery the papy and d463 resins were regenerated by column desorption using 3 0 m hcl 10 hcl solution as the eluting agent and the flow rate was set at 1 bv h the effluent was then sampled every 2 h and cu and fe concentrations were measured the results in fig 4 indicate that the preloaded cu and fe ions were effectively extracted however the cu concentration was far higher than that of fe in the eluant for both papy and d463 and this is because the feeding solution contained ten times more cu than fe the recovery ratios of cu for papy and d463 were calculated and detailed information is shown in text s6 eqs s3 s4 the results show a desorption efficiency of up to 97 3 and 96 6 for papy and d463 respectively the collected desorb solutions in the tubes were mixed together and the average concentrations of cu and fe were found to be 2103 4 mg l and 20 3 mg l for papy but 1843 6 mg l and 88 2 mg l for d463 the purity of the recovered cu was calculated using eq s 5 and the results show that the desorb solutions of papy and d463 contained cu purity of up to 99 0 and 95 4 respectively this satisfactory performance implies that the subsequent cra process can be used to successfully realize the resource utilization of hmis 3 4 mechanisms involved in combined lfua cra process 3 4 1 reactive oxygen species involved in lfua process it has been reported that some reactive oxygen species ros can be generated during the lmct reaction through eqs 9 13 kretschmer et al 2019 dong et al 2019 to explore which kinds of ros were involved in the lfua reaction the effects were evaluated when using isopropanol ipa and p benzoquinone pbq ipa and pbq are frequently used as scavengers for the hydroxyl radical oh and superoxide radical ho2 o2 respectively jourshabani et al 2017 and their influences on the decomplexation of cu ii edta are shown in fig 5 a results showed that pronounced inhibiting effects were observed in the presence of pbq but almost no effect was detected in the presence of ipa and approximate decomplexation efficiency declines in cu ii edta of 22 6 and 35 6 were observed in the first 20 min of treatment when adding pbq of 1 mm and 5 mm respectively these results suggest that ho2 o2 is the dominant ros in the decomplexation process however it was previously reported that oh generated from the photoexcitation of feoh2 eq 14 is the main ros for organic ligand degradation xu et al 2015a b and we thus postulate that lower fe iii dosages used in this study caused the different result in previous studies the ratio of fe iii organic ligand was set at 4 whereas it was set as 0 05 in our study therefore there was no free fe iii in the mixed solution where feoh2 was formed to generate oh in the lfua process furthermore the changes in the epr signals of oh and ho2 o2 under an oxygen atmosphere are shown in fig 5b where it is evident that the esr signals of dmpo o2 appear significantly after 5 min and 10 min but the epr signals of dmpo oh are hardly detected these results provide strong evidence for the formation of ho2 o2 in the iron cycle under an oxygen atmosphere and further prove that ho2 o2 participated in the decomplexation of cu ii edta however as shown in fig 5a even the addition of 5 mm p bq did not completely eliminate the edta decomposition which indicates the direct photolysis of edta by the lmct reaction plays a key role in the lfua process 9 f e i i i r c h 2 c o 2 h v f e i i r c h 2 c o 2 10 r c h 2 c o 2 o 2 r c h 2 c o 2 o 2 11 o 2 h h o 2 12 2 h o 2 h 2 o 2 o 2 13 f e i i h 2 o 2 f e i i i o h o h 14 f e o h 2 h v f e i i o h 3 4 2 crucial role of dissolved oxygen to further explore how ho2 o2 was produced in the decomplexation process the effects of ipa and pbq were evaluated under an argon atmosphere and results show fig s8a that neither ipa nor pbq had an inhibiting effect on the decomplexation of cu ii edta interestingly pbq had a facilitating effect on the decomplexation of cu ii edta this was ascribed to the fact that pbq acts as a shuttle to electrons in the redox system maka et al 2019 chandran et al 2018 as shown in fig s8b the esr signals of free radicals such as oh and ho2 o2 were also not detected under an argon atmosphere and these results indicate that the formation of ho2 o2 is closely related to dissolved oxygen do in the decomplexation of cu ii edta this mainly occurs because the carboxyl radical edta reacts with molecular oxygen and further generates the superoxide radical ho2 o2 as shown in eq 10 therefore oxygen acts as an electron acceptor for the carboxyl radical edta to achieve edta decarboxylation and the ho2 o2 produced as ros further decomposes the decarboxylate of edta to verify that oxygen was involved in the reaction batch experiments were conducted under the conditions of air purge do 8 5 mg l ambient initial do 8 5 mg l and argon purge do 0 2 mg l to test the influence of o2 on the residual ratio of edta edta was fully degraded within 15 min in the solution containing sufficient o2 from air fig 6 a however only about 20 of edta was decomposed in 30 min when the solution was filled with argon the do concentration plummeted with an extended reaction time under an ambient condition and this was accompanied by a rapid reduction in the degradation rate the do concentration in the ultrapure water under the same irradiation conditions remained basically constant fig s9 therefore the photolysis of edta was determined as being an oxygen consuming process as proven in fig 6b oxygen avoided the accumulation of fe ii and accelerated iron cycling in the reaction system this is consistent with the observation in fig s5 where the ph of the system increased after the reaction and it also illustrates that the entire reaction process also consumed protons as described in eq 5 and eq 15 oxygen and ho2 accelerated the cyclic conversion of iron therefore traces of fe iii drive the photo oxidation process to achieve the fast decomplexation of aqueous cu ii edta these results show that oxygen not only acted as an electron acceptor for the carboxyl radical edta to attain the decarboxylation of edta but it also acted as an electron scavenger to accelerate the conversion of fe iii fe ii 15 f e i i o 2 4 h 4 f e i i i h 2 o 3 4 3 mechanisms based on the above results and analyses the mechanism of the lfua process is illustrated in fig 7 generally the lfua process include direct photolysis of edta by lmct reaction pathway ① and indirect photolysis of edta by ho2 pathway ② which was generated during the lmct reaction the direct photolysis process of edta involves three main reactions fe iii displacement of hmi from the hmi edta complex lmct reaction of the fe iii edta complex excited by uv irradiation and oxidation of the excited edta in this respect displacement of cu ii from the cu ii edta complex was accomplished by fe iii and this can mainly be attributed to the complex constant of fe iii with edta which is usually several orders of magnitude higher than that of other ubiquitous metals the uv vis spectra of the mixed solution overlaped well with the calculation spectrum of hmi fe iii edta in just 1 min fig s10 which suggests that the fe iii displacement process can be achieved in 1 min after displacement the lmct reaction of fe iii edta complex was triggered by the uv irradiation which generated fe ii and the carboxyl radical edta it is also considered that the do in the mixed solution reacted with edta to realize the decarboxylation of edta and the formation of ho2 o2 and the produced ros further decompose the edta and decarboxylated edta in addition ho2 o2 in the mixed solution oxidized fe ii to fe iii to attain a fe ii fe iii redox cycle and the reformed fe iii could recombined with edta to enter the lmct reaction following the lfua process the chelation ability of the liquid phase reduced significantly which thus dramatically enhanced the affinity between the chelating resins and hmis and thus achieved their recovery the mechanisms of cu ii edta decomplexation in this study were further explored based on the intermediates identified by the time of flight mass spectrometer and the results are shown in fig s11 and table s3 ed3a was rapidly generated at the first 5min with the decrease of edta in the photo decomplexation process the decarboxylation products of ed3a edma and eda were subsequently detected indicating the successful decarboxylation of edta was achieved nta and imda were also identified as the byproducts of edta more information on the analysis of byproducts was shown in text s7 based on above analysis the possible reaction pathways for edta decomposition were depicted in fig s12 the destroy of functional groups in the edta structure would imply that the complexation of cu ii by the ligand edta in the liquid phase was weakened significantly and thus the complexation of cu ii by the solid phase tended to be enhanced 3 5 assessment of practical application 3 5 1 assessment of biological toxicity the toxic effects on aquatic organisms from both raw wastewater and treated water following the lfua cra process were assessed and zebra fish were used in the experimental model to test toxicity it is well known that super oxide dismutase sod activity and the malonaldehyde mda level are related to oxidative stress and an inflammatory response in adult zebrafish therefore sod is considered to be the critical first line of defense against oxidative stress and mda is an index of lipid peroxide and they thus indicate the degree of damage induced by free radicals yin et al 2018 qiao et al 2019 batch experiments were conducted to characterize the reduction in negative effects on the organisms following the combined process as shown in fig 8 compared with the control group significant increases in sod activity and the mda level were observed in zebra fish exposed to the raw wastewater in contrast there were barely any increases in sod activity or mda level were observed in zebrafish exposed to the treated water it can thus be concluded that the biological toxicity of the complexed wastewater was significantly reduced after treatment using the combined lfua and cra process qiao et al 2019 3 5 2 economic analysis energy consumed in the lfua process has mainly a result of uv irradiation and air aeration the concept of ee ouv which is defined as the electric energy in kwh required to degrade the target pollutant by one order of magnitude in 1 0 m3 of water was proposed to evaluate the electric energy consumed by uv lamp using 0 1 us kwh as electricity cost the ee ouv ea and the electric charge could be calculated according to eq 16 18 pan et al 2019 xiao et al 2016 the results were showed in table 2 16 e e o u v p t 1000 v l o g c i c f 38 38 p v k k w h m 3 o r d e r 1 17 e a p a t 1000 v 18 e l e c t r i c c h a r g e

m 3 ci is the initial concentration of target compound mg l 1 cf is the final concentration of target compound mg l 1 k is the pseudo first order reaction kinetic constant for the pollutant degradation min 1 ea is the energy consumption of aeration pa is the power output for aerator 0 001 kw as shown in fig s13 configuration of the adsorption system for practical use includes two adsorption columns with identical dimensions when column a is subjected to the saturation step column b is in the regeneration phase and the process is continuous regeneration of papy can be achieved with a solution of 3 0 m hcl and the column is subsequently washed with water the operating cost for the cra process relates to the cost of papy resin synthesis and consumption of the desorption liquid as seen from section 3 3 2 and eq s 4 the saturated adsorption capacity of the fixed bed dynamic adsorption capacity of papy qs to cu is 1 7 mmol g and 605 2 g of papy is required to treat 1 m3 of wastewater that has an initial cu concentration of 1 mm however it has been reported that papy resin can be entirely regenerated and used repeatedly without any significant capacity loss over five cycles therefore the maximum use cycle of resin can be set as 100 times when employed in industrial applications thus a total of 6 1 g papy resin is required for cu recycling per m3 wastewater 0 3 l of desorption solution is required per m3 of wastewater and 28 8 ml desorption solution is required for each 0 6 g 1 bv of papy resin fig 4a in addition 64 5 g cu can be recovered per m3 of wastewater with a purity of over 99 which meets industrial demands at a price of approximately 3 8 kg 1 as shown in table 2 the energy required for uv irradiation and the purchase of resin create are the major costs incurred when operating all these processes therefore the total cost for treating cu ii edta polluted water considering operating costs only is around 1 36 per m3 wastewater 3 5 3 real wastewater treatment to further verify the feasibility of the combined process an electroplating effluent from an electroplating plant in jiangsu province china was sampled and edta citrate and malic acid were employed as primary metal stabilizers papy was used to separate cu ii and the basic properties of the effluent before and after different treatment processes are shown in table 3 as expected the lfua process resulted in the highest papy utilization and cu ii recovery rate of all the processes this satisfactory performance evidences that the combined process is a promising option for use in decontaminating complexed hmis from water 4 conclusions this study proposes a novel integrated process to realize the effective removal of hmi edta complexes and the subsequent recovery of hmis from wastewater edta was removed from wastewater rapidly and efficiently at a low fe iii dosage by utilizing the lfua process which thus substantially increased the adsorption capacity of the chelating resins for hmis optimal conditions of the lfua process obtained for cu ii edta removal were as follows initial ph 3 0 5 0 molar ratio of fe iii edta 0 05 1 uv irradiation 20 min in addition the coexisting inorganic anions had a negligible effect on the removal of edta and cu ii was removed and recovered successfully by the cra process with a desorption efficiency higher than 97 furthermore the purity of cu in the desorption solution was over 99 and it was found to have a high reuse value with respect to the mechanisms involved the structure of edta were destroyed by the lmct reaction and ho2 o2 oxidation in the lfua process which resulted in significant weakening of the complexation between cu ii and edta in the liquid phase additionally o2 and ho2 o2 in the mixed solution were found to be responsible for the iron cycle as this novel process benefits from the fe iii fe ii redox cycle and employs a low fe iii dosage it does not produce iron sludge biological toxicity tests showed that the combined process considerably lowers the toxicity of wastewater therefore the method presented in this study is proven to be highly efficient effective and

18187,the efficient recovery of heavy metals from complexed wastewater is an essential but challenging task in this study a novel low fe iii driven uv air process lfua was developed to break the strong complexation between ethylenediamine tetracetic acid edta and heavy metal ions hmis and enable the enhanced recovery of hmis via chelating resin adsorption cra the inside mechanism of the lfua process includes 1 displacement of hmis from hmi edta complexes by fe iii 2 direct photolysis of fe iii edta through a ligand to metal charge transition reaction lmct and indirect photolysis of edta by ho2 o2 the iron dosage was orders of magnitude lower than that previously reported due to the fe ii fe iii redox cycle in the lfua process fe ii formed during the lmct reaction of fe iii edta was oxidized back to fe iii by o2 and ho2 and the reformed fe iii was then recombined with edta to sustains the lmct reaction edta was completely removed in 20 min at a molar ratio of fe iii edta 0 05 in addition following the lfua process the adsorption amounts of various hmis onto d463 resin were at least two orders of magnitude higher than those reported using the direct adsorption process employing the integrated technique of lfua cra enabled the efficient removal of up to 64 5 mg l of cu ii from inlet wastewater and residual cu ii was below 0 5 mg l the results of desorption experiments showed that over 90 of cu ii was recovered and the desorption solution had a cu concentration of 2 1 g l and purity of 99 furthermore the economic and practical feasibility of using the combined process of lfua cra was analyzed to substantiate that the technique is highly efficient and clean produces no harmful sludge therefore it is an appropriate and practical process in removing hmis edta complexes and recovering hmis from wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords heavy metal ions recovery edta complex iron cycle 1 introduction heavy metal ions hmis in wastewater can have a detrimental impact on human health and their collection is of value with respect to their potential application in industry therefore their removal and recovery has attracted considerable research attention ko et al 2018 xu et al 2015b ethylenediamine tetracetic acid edta is a commonly used chelating agent that is widely used in the electroplating textile and battery industries song et al 2019 wang et al 2019a b however edta can form stable complexes with various hmis over a wide ph range and this dramatically reduces the hmi removal efficiency when employed with conventional technologies such as chemical precipitation ion exchange and membrane separation balladares et al 2018 dabrowski et al 2004 sunil et al 2018 ma et al 2009 in the past decades various technologies have been developed to treat edta complexed hmis yu et al 2017 guan et al 2015 and previous works have focused on the following two strategies destructive and non destructive methods destructive methods involve destroying edta using advanced oxidation processes aops such as fenton and photochemical oxidation prior to employing subsequent chemical precipitation to remove the hmis song et al 2019 ye et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 however aops based on ho and so4 are sensitive to coexisting inorganic anions xu et al 2017 huang et al 2019 in addition the high consumption of oxidants and the further need to treat the heavy metal sludge make these treatment processes costly non destructive methods involve the removal of complexed hmis using adsorption technologies yan et al 2019 li et al 2019 they have been proven to be simple and environmentally friendly for recovering hmis and they avoid the formation of harmful heavy metal sludges however edta has an inhibitive effect on the adsorption process and him edta complexes often remain in the desorption solution which limits the subsequent reuse of hmis yan et al 2019 repo et al 2013 it is thus important to develop a new and effective technology to realize the deep removal and recycling of edta complexed hmis the stability constant of fe iii with edta is several orders of magnitude higher than that of most typical hmis fe iii carboxylate complexes are photochemically reactive and could go through ligand to metal charge transfer lmct reaction eq 1 to result in the direct decomposition of carboxylates nowack et al 1996 ling et al 2017 in this respect a combined uv fe iii oh process was recently proposed to treat complexed hmis xu et al 2015b ye et al 2017 sun et al 2019 shan et al 2018 however its high consumption of fe iii mole ratio fe iii cu ii 4 not only limits the reaction conditions to an extremely acidic stage but also produces a large amount of iron sludge which then increases subsequent treatment costs besides it is difficult to recycle hmis in the presence of such a high iron concentration because sediments form during the irradiation process therefore a cost effective and environmentally friendly process should be developed to reduce dosage consumption and also avoid possible secondary pollution while recovering hmis it has been reported that the existence of the fe ii fe iii redox cycle during the photochemical reduction of cr vi in the presence of fe iii organic carboxylic acids marinho et al 2016 we have since found that fe ii generated during the lmct process can be retransformed into fe iii through the fe ii fe iii photochemical cycle when there is an electron scavenger in the wastewater and the iron cycle in reaction process could maintain the lmct reaction without the need for a high iron dosage it has been proved oxygen can serve as electron scavenger nevertheless the role of oxygen in an lmct reaction involving the fe iii carboxylate has not yet been reported 1 f e i i i l h v f e i i l where l and l means carboxylates and carbon centered organic radicals derived from the decarboxylation of carbonates respectively we thus propose the use of a combined process involving lfua process driven hmi edta decomplexation and subsequent hmis separation using chelating resin adsorption cra where air is introduced to reduce the fe iii dosage and promote the fe ii fe iii redox cycle during the irradiation process chelating resins are used to recover hmis because of their good extraction capacity and commercial applications using cu ii edta as a model compound several important parameters of the lfua process were optimized and the inside mechanisms were elucidated in detail an economic analysis and a practicality assessment of the combined process were also conducted 2

experiments 2 2 1 irradiation experiments photo decomplexation experiments were conducted in an xpa 7 photoreactor equipped with a 500 ml cylindrical borosilicate glass reactor nanjing xujiang electromechanical plant china 100 300 and 500 w medium pressure hg lamps as well as a 500 w xenon lamp were used as light sources the lfua process in the photoreactor mainly involved three steps 1 a selected volume of 0 1 m fe no3 3 stock solution and 10 ml of cu ii edta stock solution containing 0 1 m cu ii and 0 2 m edta were mixed and then diluted to 1 l and 400 ml of the above ph adjusted

wastewater 0 6 g of fresh dry resin was placed in a water jacketed glass column φ10 240 mm following photolysis the mixed solution was pumped into the column at a flow rate of 5 bed volume bv per hour the effluent was sampled at regular intervals 1 h at 25 c 2 2 3 biological toxicity experiments zebrafish were selected as the model biological species and were used in toxicological experiments super oxide dismutase sod activity and the malonaldehyde mda level were tested to assess the bioactivity of zebrafish the detailed operational and test procedures are shown in text s2 2 3 analytical procedures an agilent 1200 infinity series hplc system equipped with a c18 column was used to measure edta concentrations in accordance with a method provided in the previous literature thalmann et al 2018 and the detailed information was shown in text s3 the concentrations of hmis and total fe were determined using a thermo fisher ice 3300 atomic absorption spectrophotometer fe ii was measured using the 1 10 phenanthroline spectrophotometric method and an agilent 8435 uv vis spectrophotometer was employed to record the absorption spectra of samples the dissolved oxygen do concentration was determined with a hach hq30d portable dissolved oxygen meter and the electron spin resonance esr signals of oh and o2 trapped by dmpo were detected with a bruker elexsys 580 spectrometer the light intensity was measured by a radiometer photoelectric instrument factory of beijing normal university china equipped with a sensor with peak sensitivity of 365 nm and the light intensity of the lamps was shown in fig s1 furthermore methanol was employed as the solvent when o2 was the target reactive radical cheng et al 2019 huang et al 2016 the degradation products of edta were identified by a time of flight mass spectrometer xevo g2 xs qtof agilent 7890b analyzer and the method used is shown in text s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 enhanced hmi recovery using lfua pretreatment four different resins papy d463 s914 and s950 containing aminopyridine iminodiacetic acid thiourea and amino phosphonic functional groups respectively were used to evaluate the validity of the lfua process and detailed information about the resins is provided in table s1 results show that the adsorption amounts of cu ii onto different chelating resins were obviously elevated following use of the lfua process compared to direct adsorption process fig 1 a and this occurred because the structure of edta was destroyed during the lfua process d463 was employed to test the efficiency of the lfua process for different edta complexed hmis as it has a good affinity with various hmis validation of the lfua process with respect to the subsequent adsorption of edta complexed cu ii zn ii cd ii and pb ii is shown in fig 1b control experiments were also conducted in this respect and direct adsorption was found to be negligible as expected which indicates that edta competed with the ligands on the resin to bind the hmis hmi adsorption was barely enhanced when using the fe iii air treatment which is possibly due to the poor degradation of edta although it has been reported that fe iii can displace hmis from hmi edta complexes xu et al 2015a b shan et al 2018 the concentration of fe iii was only one tenth of that of the hmis during the lfua process therefore sufficient amounts of hmis to be released via fe iii displacement was difficult similarly the uv air process barely enhanced the adsorption amounts of hmis and this occurred because the photoactivity of hmi edta complexes was far lower than that of the fe iii edta complex xu et al 2017 however the adsorption amounts of hmis were comparatively elevated after using the fe iii uv process which confirms the better synergetic effect of fe iii and uv in fact edta was decomposed completely after the lfua process which resulted in a sharp reduction in the chelation ability of the liquid phase and the ligands on the resin successfully captured the hmis these excellent results validated the broad spectrum of the lfua process for simplification cu ii edta was chosen as the model pollutant in the process used to optimize and explore the mechanism and the results are reported in the following sections 3 2 parameter optimization of lfua process 3 2 1 effect of fe iii dosage the effect of the fe iii dosage on removal of the cu ii edta complex was evaluated and fig 2 a shows the residual edta proportion as a function of reaction time under different fe iii dosages the decomposition process under different concentrations of fe iii fits well with pseudo first order kinetics equations eq 3 3 d e d t a d t k a p p e d t a as shown in table 1 kapp significantly increased from 0 0064 min 1 to 0 3481 min 1 when the fe iii concentration was increased from 0 mm mole ratio fe iii edta 0 to 2 mm mole ratio fe iii edta 1 0 table s2 shows that use of the lfua process promoted the decomposition kinetics of the cu ii edta complex compared with other decomplexation techniques such as use of uv persulfate uv h2o2 and the electro fenton process it was noted that kapp remained almost unchanged when the mole ratio of fe iii edta exceeded 0 25 inset of fig 2a and it was considered this was related to the formation of iron hydroxide and colloid which influenced both the dissolved iron concentration and the transmittance of the solution this postulation was validated by the turbidity of the reaction system which exponentially increased from 0 ftu to 15 8 ftu when the mole ratio of fe iii edta increased from 0 to 2 as shown in fig s2 in addition toc removal was augmented slightly at a higher fe iii dosage fig s3 above all the optimum mole ratio of fe iii edta was set as 0 05 3 2 2 effect of ph as hmi edta complexes contained wastewater are discharged at different ph values huang et al 2019 rekab et al 2014 it is useful to assess the effects of initial ph on the lfua process therefore the influence of initial ph on the removal efficiency of edta was examined at a ph range between 3 and 9 fig 2b and fig s4 shows the distributions of fe iii edta species at different ph values calculated by minteq 3 1 the significant deterioration in the removal efficiency under higher ph values can be attributed to the transformation of the fe iii edta species at ph 3 6 fe iii edta was the major species of fe iii edta but at ph values higher than 6 0 fe iii ohedta2 gradually increased and became the main form the higher degradation rate at relatively low ph values could have been caused by the enhanced production of the reactive species it is of note that the reaction rates at ph 3 0 6 0 were almost the same as those at the initial rate however after the reaction had proceeded for 5 min the rates at ph 4 0 6 0 began to decline which could be ascribed to the spontaneous rise in ph during the lfua process the lfua process consumes hydrogen which is shown by the balanced ph of the mixed solution following photolysis fig s5 it is thus possible that the degradation rate of edta at ph 4 6 was lower than at ph 3 because of the easier increase in ph when the same amount of hydrogen was consumed in addition it has been reported that ho2 o2 plays an important role in the fe ii fe iii cycle therefore ho2 o2 equilibrium in the lfua process should favor ho2 because the ph during this process is lower than 4 86 used in eq 4 xu et al 2017 faust and zepp 1993 ho2 promotes the fe ii fe iii redox cycle through eqs 5 and 6 however the reaction rate constant of eq 5 is obviously higher than that of eq 6 which indicates that ho2 is also beneficial to the formation of fe iii and results in the formation of h2o2 if the ph of the solution is higher than 4 68 ho2 o2 equilibrium will favor o2 which is not be beneficial for the conversion of fe ii to fe iii eqs 7 and 8 ou et al 2008 based on this analysis the optimum initial ph of the lfua process was set as 3 0 4 o 2 h h o 2 5 f e i i h o 2 h f e i i i h 2 o 2 2 o h k 1 2 10 6 m 1 s 1 6 f e i i i h o 2 f e i i o 2 h k 1 10 3 m 1 s 1 7 f e i i o 2 2 h f e i i i h 2 o 2 k 1 0 10 7 m 1 s 1 8 f e i i i o 2 2 h f e i i o 2 k 1 5 10 8 m 1 s 1 3 2 3 effect of irradiation source photodegradation of edta with 100 w 300 w and 500 w hg lamps as well as a 500 w xenon lamp is shown in fig 2c the concentration of edta decreased by only 19 after 30 min using the simulated solar light xenon lamp li et al 2011 wang et al 2019a b owing to low absorbance of the fe iii edta complex in the visible range in contrast the degradation of edta was significantly promoted under irradiation with the hg lamps and the reaction time required for complete edta degradation was reduced from over 30 min 15 min and 10 min when the power was elevated from 100 w to 300 w and 500 w respectively therefore the 300 w hg lamp was selected as the optimum light source 3 2 4 effect of inorganic anions anions including so4 2 cl and no3 were added to test the practical applicability of the proposed decomplexation process xu et al 2017 showed that the addition of cl and no3 both inhibited degradation of cu ii edta in a uv h2o2 system however as shown in fig 2d and 20 mm of coexisting anions had little effect on the decomposition of edta in the lfua process these opposing results can possibly be explained by that the peak sensitivity of the uv lamp used in the lfua process was 365 nm instead of 254 nm in the previous report which would have made it difficult to excite cl and no3 to form free chlorine and nitrite and thus suppress the reaction process 3 3 recovery of cu by cra process 3 3 1 fixed bed dynamic adsorption as seen from fig 1a the cu adsorption capacities of papy and d463 exceeded those of the other two tested chelating resins to investigate the applicability of papy and d463 resins for effectively removing and recovering cu from the irradiated solution breakthrough curves for the simultaneous adsorption of cu and fe onto papy and d463 were determined characterizations of the optimized resins papy and d463 are supplied in text s4 fig s6 and tables s3 s4 as shown in fig 3 a and c the increasing concentrations of cu and fe in the outlet water ensured gradual saturation of the resins fe reached saturation point cout let 0 9c0 quickly for papy whereas the concentration of fe in the outlet water increased slowly for d463 however the cu concentrations in the effluent increased slowly for both resins these results can be explained by differences in the distribution coefficients kd and separation factors α between cu and fe when using papy and d463 text s5 a higher kd is an index of the potential mobility of metals represents stronger sorption onto resins fig s7 shows that the kd of cu is higher for both papy and d463 compared to fe however the separation factors αcu fe for papy and d463 which were calculated by the ratio of the distribution coefficients of cu and fe were 12314 7 and 3 9 respectively therefore the selective uptake of cu by papy was much higher than that by d463 as shown in fig 3b and d the cu concentrations detected in the effluent were below 0 5 mg l before 130 bv for papy resin and 80 bv for d463 resin respectively it thus appears that the d463 resin could be used with the standard discharge of both cu and fe within 80 bv feed solution however papy achieved a high purity recovery of cu therefore the low concentration of fe in the effluent could be easily removed by subsequent resin adsorption the results imply that papy is the most effective chelating resin for use in recovering cu ii from irradiated wastewater 3 3 2 resin regeneration and cu recovery the papy and d463 resins were regenerated by column desorption using 3 0 m hcl 10 hcl solution as the eluting agent and the flow rate was set at 1 bv h the effluent was then sampled every 2 h and cu and fe concentrations were measured the results in fig 4 indicate that the preloaded cu and fe ions were effectively extracted however the cu concentration was far higher than that of fe in the eluant for both papy and d463 and this is because the feeding solution contained ten times more cu than fe the recovery ratios of cu for papy and d463 were calculated and detailed information is shown in text s6 eqs s3 s4 the results show a desorption efficiency of up to 97 3 and 96 6 for papy and d463 respectively the collected desorb solutions in the tubes were mixed together and the average concentrations of cu and fe were found to be 2103 4 mg l and 20 3 mg l for papy but 1843 6 mg l and 88 2 mg l for d463 the purity of the recovered cu was calculated using eq s 5 and the results show that the desorb solutions of papy and d463 contained cu purity of up to 99 0 and 95 4 respectively this satisfactory performance implies that the subsequent cra process can be used to successfully realize the resource utilization of hmis 3 4 mechanisms involved in combined lfua cra process 3 4 1 reactive oxygen species involved in lfua process it has been reported that some reactive oxygen species ros can be generated during the lmct reaction through eqs 9 13 kretschmer et al 2019 dong et al 2019 to explore which kinds of ros were involved in the lfua reaction the effects were evaluated when using isopropanol ipa and p benzoquinone pbq ipa and pbq are frequently used as scavengers for the hydroxyl radical oh and superoxide radical ho2 o2 respectively jourshabani et al 2017 and their influences on the decomplexation of cu ii edta are shown in fig 5 a results showed that pronounced inhibiting effects were observed in the presence of pbq but almost no effect was detected in the presence of ipa and approximate decomplexation efficiency declines in cu ii edta of 22 6 and 35 6 were observed in the first 20 min of treatment when adding pbq of 1 mm and 5 mm respectively these results suggest that ho2 o2 is the dominant ros in the decomplexation process however it was previously reported that oh generated from the photoexcitation of feoh2 eq 14 is the main ros for organic ligand degradation xu et al 2015a b and we thus postulate that lower fe iii dosages used in this study caused the different result in previous studies the ratio of fe iii organic ligand was set at 4 whereas it was set as 0 05 in our study therefore there was no free fe iii in the mixed solution where feoh2 was formed to generate oh in the lfua process furthermore the changes in the epr signals of oh and ho2 o2 under an oxygen atmosphere are shown in fig 5b where it is evident that the esr signals of dmpo o2 appear significantly after 5 min and 10 min but the epr signals of dmpo oh are hardly detected these results provide strong evidence for the formation of ho2 o2 in the iron cycle under an oxygen atmosphere and further prove that ho2 o2 participated in the decomplexation of cu ii edta however as shown in fig 5a even the addition of 5 mm p bq did not completely eliminate the edta decomposition which indicates the direct photolysis of edta by the lmct reaction plays a key role in the lfua process 9 f e i i i r c h 2 c o 2 h v f e i i r c h 2 c o 2 10 r c h 2 c o 2 o 2 r c h 2 c o 2 o 2 11 o 2 h h o 2 12 2 h o 2 h 2 o 2 o 2 13 f e i i h 2 o 2 f e i i i o h o h 14 f e o h 2 h v f e i i o h 3 4 2 crucial role of dissolved oxygen to further explore how ho2 o2 was produced in the decomplexation process the effects of ipa and pbq were evaluated under an argon atmosphere and results show fig s8a that neither ipa nor pbq had an inhibiting effect on the decomplexation of cu ii edta interestingly pbq had a facilitating effect on the decomplexation of cu ii edta this was ascribed to the fact that pbq acts as a shuttle to electrons in the redox system maka et al 2019 chandran et al 2018 as shown in fig s8b the esr signals of free radicals such as oh and ho2 o2 were also not detected under an argon atmosphere and these results indicate that the formation of ho2 o2 is closely related to dissolved oxygen do in the decomplexation of cu ii edta this mainly occurs because the carboxyl radical edta reacts with molecular oxygen and further generates the superoxide radical ho2 o2 as shown in eq 10 therefore oxygen acts as an electron acceptor for the carboxyl radical edta to achieve edta decarboxylation and the ho2 o2 produced as ros further decomposes the decarboxylate of edta to verify that oxygen was involved in the reaction batch experiments were conducted under the conditions of air purge do 8 5 mg l ambient initial do 8 5 mg l and argon purge do 0 2 mg l to test the influence of o2 on the residual ratio of edta edta was fully degraded within 15 min in the solution containing sufficient o2 from air fig 6 a however only about 20 of edta was decomposed in 30 min when the solution was filled with argon the do concentration plummeted with an extended reaction time under an ambient condition and this was accompanied by a rapid reduction in the degradation rate the do concentration in the ultrapure water under the same irradiation conditions remained basically constant fig s9 therefore the photolysis of edta was determined as being an oxygen consuming process as proven in fig 6b oxygen avoided the accumulation of fe ii and accelerated iron cycling in the reaction system this is consistent with the observation in fig s5 where the ph of the system increased after the reaction and it also illustrates that the entire reaction process also consumed protons as described in eq 5 and eq 15 oxygen and ho2 accelerated the cyclic conversion of iron therefore traces of fe iii drive the photo oxidation process to achieve the fast decomplexation of aqueous cu ii edta these results show that oxygen not only acted as an electron acceptor for the carboxyl radical edta to attain the decarboxylation of edta but it also acted as an electron scavenger to accelerate the conversion of fe iii fe ii 15 f e i i o 2 4 h 4 f e i i i h 2 o 3 4 3 mechanisms based on the above results and analyses the mechanism of the lfua process is illustrated in fig 7 generally the lfua process include direct photolysis of edta by lmct reaction pathway ① and indirect photolysis of edta by ho2 pathway ② which was generated during the lmct reaction the direct photolysis process of edta involves three main reactions fe iii displacement of hmi from the hmi edta complex lmct reaction of the fe iii edta complex excited by uv irradiation and oxidation of the excited edta in this respect displacement of cu ii from the cu ii edta complex was accomplished by fe iii and this can mainly be attributed to the complex constant of fe iii with edta which is usually several orders of magnitude higher than that of other ubiquitous metals the uv vis spectra of the mixed solution overlaped well with the calculation spectrum of hmi fe iii edta in just 1 min fig s10 which suggests that the fe iii displacement process can be achieved in 1 min after displacement the lmct reaction of fe iii edta complex was triggered by the uv irradiation which generated fe ii and the carboxyl radical edta it is also considered that the do in the mixed solution reacted with edta to realize the decarboxylation of edta and the formation of ho2 o2 and the produced ros further decompose the edta and decarboxylated edta in addition ho2 o2 in the mixed solution oxidized fe ii to fe iii to attain a fe ii fe iii redox cycle and the reformed fe iii could recombined with edta to enter the lmct reaction following the lfua process the chelation ability of the liquid phase reduced significantly which thus dramatically enhanced the affinity between the chelating resins and hmis and thus achieved their recovery the mechanisms of cu ii edta decomplexation in this study were further explored based on the intermediates identified by the time of flight mass spectrometer and the results are shown in fig s11 and table s3 ed3a was rapidly generated at the first 5min with the decrease of edta in the photo decomplexation process the decarboxylation products of ed3a edma and eda were subsequently detected indicating the successful decarboxylation of edta was achieved nta and imda were also identified as the byproducts of edta more information on the analysis of byproducts was shown in text s7 based on above analysis the possible reaction pathways for edta decomposition were depicted in fig s12 the destroy of functional groups in the edta structure would imply that the complexation of cu ii by the ligand edta in the liquid phase was weakened significantly and thus the complexation of cu ii by the solid phase tended to be enhanced 3 5 assessment of practical application 3 5 1 assessment of biological toxicity the toxic effects on aquatic organisms from both raw wastewater and treated water following the lfua cra process were assessed and zebra fish were used in the experimental model to test toxicity it is well known that super oxide dismutase sod activity and the malonaldehyde mda level are related to oxidative stress and an inflammatory response in adult zebrafish therefore sod is considered to be the critical first line of defense against oxidative stress and mda is an index of lipid peroxide and they thus indicate the degree of damage induced by free radicals yin et al 2018 qiao et al 2019 batch experiments were conducted to characterize the reduction in negative effects on the organisms following the combined process as shown in fig 8 compared with the control group significant increases in sod activity and the mda level were observed in zebra fish exposed to the raw wastewater in contrast there were barely any increases in sod activity or mda level were observed in zebrafish exposed to the treated water it can thus be concluded that the biological toxicity of the complexed wastewater was significantly reduced after treatment using the combined lfua and cra process qiao et al 2019 3 5 2 economic analysis energy consumed in the lfua process has mainly a result of uv irradiation and air aeration the concept of ee ouv which is defined as the electric energy in kwh required to degrade the target pollutant by one order of magnitude in 1 0 m3 of water was proposed to evaluate the electric energy consumed by uv lamp using 0 1 us kwh as electricity cost the ee ouv ea and the electric charge could be calculated according to eq 16 18 pan et al 2019 xiao et al 2016 the results were showed in table 2 16 e e o u v p t 1000 v l o g c i c f 38 38 p v k k w h m 3 o r d e r 1 17 e a p a t 1000 v 18 e l e c t r i c c h a r g e

m 3 ci is the initial concentration of target compound mg l 1 cf is the final concentration of target compound mg l 1 k is the pseudo first order reaction kinetic constant for the pollutant degradation min 1 ea is the energy consumption of aeration pa is the power output for aerator 0 001 kw as shown in fig s13 configuration of the adsorption system for practical use includes two adsorption columns with identical dimensions when column a is subjected to the saturation step column b is in the regeneration phase and the process is continuous regeneration of papy can be achieved with a solution of 3 0 m hcl and the column is subsequently washed with water the operating cost for the cra process relates to the cost of papy resin synthesis and consumption of the desorption liquid as seen from section 3 3 2 and eq s 4 the saturated adsorption capacity of the fixed bed dynamic adsorption capacity of papy qs to cu is 1 7 mmol g and 605 2 g of papy is required to treat 1 m3 of wastewater that has an initial cu concentration of 1 mm however it has been reported that papy resin can be entirely regenerated and used repeatedly without any significant capacity loss over five cycles therefore the maximum use cycle of resin can be set as 100 times when employed in industrial applications thus a total of 6 1 g papy resin is required for cu recycling per m3 wastewater 0 3 l of desorption solution is required per m3 of wastewater and 28 8 ml desorption solution is required for each 0 6 g 1 bv of papy resin fig 4a in addition 64 5 g cu can be recovered per m3 of wastewater with a purity of over 99 which meets industrial demands at a price of approximately 3 8 kg 1 as shown in table 2 the energy required for uv irradiation and the purchase of resin create are the major costs incurred when operating all these processes therefore the total cost for treating cu ii edta polluted water considering operating costs only is around 1 36 per m3 wastewater 3 5 3 real wastewater treatment to further verify the feasibility of the combined process an electroplating effluent from an electroplating plant in jiangsu province china was sampled and edta citrate and malic acid were employed as primary metal stabilizers papy was used to separate cu ii and the basic properties of the effluent before and after different treatment processes are shown in table 3 as expected the lfua process resulted in the highest papy utilization and cu ii recovery rate of all the processes this satisfactory performance evidences that the combined process is a promising option for use in decontaminating complexed hmis from water 4 conclusions this study proposes a novel integrated process to realize the effective removal of hmi edta complexes and the subsequent recovery of hmis from wastewater edta was removed from wastewater rapidly and efficiently at a low fe iii dosage by utilizing the lfua process which thus substantially increased the adsorption capacity of the chelating resins for hmis optimal conditions of the lfua process obtained for cu ii edta removal were as follows initial ph 3 0 5 0 molar ratio of fe iii edta 0 05 1 uv irradiation 20 min in addition the coexisting inorganic anions had a negligible effect on the removal of edta and cu ii was removed and recovered successfully by the cra process with a desorption efficiency higher than 97 furthermore the purity of cu in the desorption solution was over 99 and it was found to have a high reuse value with respect to the mechanisms involved the structure of edta were destroyed by the lmct reaction and ho2 o2 oxidation in the lfua process which resulted in significant weakening of the complexation between cu ii and edta in the liquid phase additionally o2 and ho2 o2 in the mixed solution were found to be responsible for the iron cycle as this novel process benefits from the fe iii fe ii redox cycle and employs a low fe iii dosage it does not produce iron sludge biological toxicity tests showed that the combined process considerably lowers the toxicity of wastewater therefore the method presented in this study is proven to be highly efficient effective and

reversed phase adapted from hermes et al 2018 and ii hilic adapted from boulard et al 2018 they are described in detail in table s5 and ms specific parameters are given in tables s3 and s4 2 5 method performance and quantification quantification was performed by a 14 point calibration ranging from 0 5 ng l to 5000 ng l the quantification was based on a linear regression with a 1 x weighting factor if available internal standards were used to compensate matrix effects table s6 data processing was performed with the software multiquant 3 0 2 sciex darmstadt germany instrumental precision was determined by repeated injections of extracts of 10 ng g d w correspond to 167 ng l for rplc analytes and 333 ng l for hilic analytes and 50 ng g d w correspond to 833 ng l for rplc analytes and 1667 ng l for hilic analytes spiked spm on the same day n 6 and on four different days n 4 the accuracy of the method was verified by determining the recoveries at three different concentration levels 10 ng g d w 50 ng g d w and 100 ng g d w as no uncontaminated spm was available the original analyte concentrations were substracted prior to the calculation of the recoveries relative recoveries were calculated by normalizing the area of the analytes with that of the corresponding isotope labeled internal standard precision of the method was determined by calculating the 95 confidence interval of four separate spiked extracts the loq was defined as the concentration at which a signal to noise ratio s n of 10 is reached for the mrm transition used for quantification and a s n of 3 for the mrm transition used for confirmation matrix effects were determined by spiking samples after the extraction and comparing their analyte peak areas with those of a standard at the same concentration time trends were plotted using the loess method according to the approach developed by fryer and nicholson 1999 this method used a locally weighted regression smoother loess curves and their pointwise 95 confidence intervals were plotted using the ggplot2 package of the software r 3 5 0 cran 2 6 sorption experiments sorption experiments were performed largely according to oecd 106 oecd 2000 with freeze dried sediments from the rhine harbor ehrenbreitstein at koblenz rhine km 591 4 toc 3 9 see table s7 for the other characteristics the sorption isotherms were determined by two sediment water ratios 1 5 and 1 25 to ensure a distribution of the analytes between the liquid phase and the solid phase between 20 and 80 exactly 50 ml of 0 01 mol l cacl2 was equilibrated with 2 g 25 1 sediment water ratio or 10 g 5 1 sediment water ratio freeze dried sediments for 24 h using an orbital shaker ika ks260 200 min 1 analytes were spiked from 10 to 2000 ng in duplicate via a multi analyte stock solution the methanol content in the sample did not exceed 1 the samples were then agitated again for 24 h in the orbital shaker the time was sufficient to reach sorption equilibriums for the analytes data not shown afterwards both phases were separated and analyzed as described in section 2 4 for all analytes the mass balance could be determined due to the quantification of both sediment and water phases sorption isotherms were plotted for those 90 analytes showing closed mass balance 30 data not shown five concentration levels were spiked covering three orders of magnitude for each concentration level and each matrix the average of the duplicate analysis was plotted data processing was performed with the software r 3 5 0 cran the ph of the water phase varied between 6 9 and 7 9 3 results and discussion 3 1 analytical method the developed analytical method allows for a sensitive simultaneous detection of 100 pharmaceuticals metabolites and transformation products sorbed to spm loqs ranged from 0 09 clopidogrel to 11 7 ng g d w dehydrotramadol fig s1 a table s8 the accuracy of the method was determined at three different spiking levels 10 ng g d w 50 ng g d w and 100 ng g d w due to appreciable environmental concentrations present in spm of german rivers spiking levels at lower concentrations were not performed at all spiking levels the recoveries ranged from 70 acesulfame to 127 o desmethyl metoprolol except for 13 analytes which showed either slightly higher or slightly lower recoveries at one of the spike levels fig s1 b an acceptable precision was obtained with 95 confidence intervals ranging from 1 acesulfame to 29 sitagliptin for the majority of analytes table s8 matrix effects ranged from 77 sertraline ketone up to 365 aliskiren fig s1 c however they are successfully compensated by isotopically labeled surrogate standards even for aliskiren table s8 for more than 50 analytes a quantification without isotopically labeled standards would be sufficient fig s1 d in general the achieved loqs were comparable to those reported in literature utilizing a spe clean up aminot et al 2015 da silva et al 2011 baker and kasprzyk hordern 2011 alvarez ruiz et al 2015 in this study a solvent exchange was preferred as a clean up due to its unspecificity and high throughput an appropriate spe material would be very difficult to find since the selected analytes exhibit a broad range of polarities thus a reliable analytical method has been developed enabling the quantification of 100 pharmaceuticals metabolites and transformation products sorbed to spm for the optimization of the extraction method ple and use ultrasound extraction were compared using methanol milli q 1 1 as extraction solvent on this basis ple was selected since all analytes except diclofenac and lamotrigine showed higher recoveries than with use fig s2 a for the optimization of the ple extraction solvent different ratios of methanol milli q were tested overall best recoveries were obtained with methanol milli q 1 1 fig s2 b the addition of ammonium hydroxide to the extraction solvent did not provide any significant improvement fig s2 c while the addition of formic acid improved the recoveries of positively charged analytes but decreased those of others in particular valsartan sulfamethaxole and candesartan highest recoveries for the positively charged analytes were obtained with methanol 2 formic acid 1 1 v v fig s2 d as a consequence in the final analytical extraction method both methanol milli q 1 1 and methanol 2 formic acid 1 1 v v were applied this combination ensured the highest overall extraction efficiencies see fig s2 e extraction temperature was varied between 80 and 120 c in general the extraction recoveries improved with higher temperatures this was particularly the case for positively charged analytes such as citalopram whose extraction recoveries increased from 32 14 80 c to 100 26 100 c certain analytes such as diphenhydramine or hydrochlorothiazide exhibited a thermal degradation at temperatures above 110 c as no significant improvement of the extraction efficiencies was observed above 100 c an extraction temperature of 100 c was selected see fig s2 f 3 2 sorption all selected compounds exhibited almost linear sorption isotherms with freundlich n values ranging from 0 87 to 1 17 table s9 hence sorption affinity could be described by the partition coefficient kd to ensure reliable partition coefficients we measured the analytes in both the water and sediment phases and calculated the partition coefficients only when the mass balance was closed within an uncertainty of 30 these conditions were fulfilled by 90 analytes due to the high difference in polarity and pka values the kd values ranged from 0 64 l kg acesulfame to 9300 l kg diphenhydramine the obtained kd values were comparable with those reported in literature table s10 exact 41 analytes showed partition coefficients below 10 l kg for 31 the kd ranged between 10 and 100 l kg and for 18 analytes kd above 100 l kg were determined fig 2 kd values freundlich affinity parameters kf and exponents n determined by plotting the sorption isotherms and the logarithmic sorption isotherms are summarized in table s9 in general positively charged analytes showed higher kd values than the neutral and negatively charged substances fig s3 all analytes with kd 800 l kg sitagliptin were positively charged at ph 7 moreover guanylurea a polar and positively charged molecule log d at ph 7 3 9 exhibited a similar kd value 14 0 0 1 l kg as the considerably less polar but non charged carbamazepine 10 0 0 2 l kg log d at ph 7 2 8 franco and trapp 2008 reported a higher sorption affinity of protonated compounds than of neutral or negatively charged substances it can be assumed that positively charged analytes are susceptible to a higher sorption via cation exchange and surface complexation or cation bridging on negatively charged surface sites of organic matter and clay minerals mackay and vasudevan 2012 droge and goss 2013 3 3 concentration trends 3 3 1 occurrence and spatial distribution of pharmaceuticals bound to spm between 2005 and 2015 temporal trends of pharmaceuticals as well as their metabolites and tps were determined in spm taken from five different sampling sites of german rivers see table s11 for the toc values the number of analytes and their concentrations detected in spm increased with an increasing portion of wastewater as a consequence in the saar at rehlingen up to 61 analytes were found about 15 wastewater 1 1 wastewater proportion were estimated from the wastewater proportions in koblenz rhine 5 schlüsener et al 2015 and the carbamazepine concentrations at the different sampling locations while in spm sampled along the rhine up to 24 analytes were detected in weil about 2 wastewater 1 and up to 42 analytes in bimmen about 7 wastewater 1 maximal concentrations were determined for guanylurea a tp of the antidiabetic metformin trautwein and kümmerer 2011 with concentrations of 190 6 ng g d w in the saar rehlingen and 160 6 ng g d w in the rhine bimmen to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that the occurrence of guanylurea in spm is described the analytes showing the highest concentrations 10 ng g were either positively charged or more hydrophobic log d 4 the few exceptions acesulfame leveritacetam acid and valsartan correspond to substances whose consumption was relatively high 100 t pro year iqvia ltd 2017 midas database frankfurt am main germany a comparison of the concentrations measured in spm of the saar and the rhine helps to identify emissions from pharmaceutical industries as those are very rarely located in the saar catchment area in comparison to the rhine catchment thus municipal wastewater effluents are in nearly all cases the major source of pharmaceutical emissions in the saar in order to distinguish the impact of municipal wastewater and direct or indirect industrial discharge concentrations in spm were normalized by the detected carbamazepine concentrations the antiepileptic carbamazepine is well described in the literature as a marker of municipal wastewater due to its persistence and ubiquitous presence in rivers and streams containing appreciable portions of wwtp effluents ternes 1998 kahle et al 2009 scheurer et al 2011 the concentrations of sitagliptin and sotalol at the different sampling locations of the rhine and in the saar at rehlingen are shown in fig 3 for both pharmaceuticals the concentrations increased along the rhine due to an increasing wastewater proportion in rehlingen saar with the highest portion of wwtp effluents the highest concentrations of the selected analytes were found the concentrations normalized with the carbamazepine concentrations were relatively constant over the five sampling sites at the rhine indicating that effluents of municipal wwtps are the main source a similar behavior was found for most analytes such as cetirizine or amisulpride in contrast to sitagliptin and sotalol spm concentrations of guanylurea a tp of metformin decrease along the rhine from weil to koblenz fig 3 for example in 2009 119 8 ng g d w of guanylurea were measured in rhine spm at weil in comparison to 71 6 ng g d w of guanylurea downstream in koblenz this difference cannot be caused by different consumption behaviors in the three major countries of the southern rhine catchment area switzerland france germany since similar consumptions for metformin the guanylurea precursor were reported in 2009 with 9 6 g capita for switzerland 12 g capita for france and 12 g capita for germany singer et al 2016 furthermore despite a seven times higher wastewater proportion similar concentrations were found in rehlingen saar 124 7 ng g d w and weil rhine 119 8 ng g d w this is particularly emphasized by the difference of carbamazepine normalized concentrations which reached a ratio of 106 23 in weil in comparison to a ratio of 17 2 in rehlingen saar therefore we assumed that probably a significant industrial discharge of guanylurea upstream weil is causing the different ratios contrary to guanylurea the concentrations of its precursor metformin are proportional to the wastewater proportion fig 3 the guanylurea metformin ratio decreases strongly along the rhine varying for example in 2009 from 9 8 in weil to 3 6 in bimmen two possible explanations may explain this observation i metformin is quantitatively transformed to guanylurea in the wwtps through which the discharge occurs this is however relatively unlikely since quantitative transformation of metformin to guanylurea was to date only observed during long term laboratory experiments tisler and zwiener 2019 ii the discharged guanylurea did not originate from metformin but from other precursors the existence of other precursors than metformin for guanylurea was already hypothesized by tisler and zwiener 2018 to explain high guanylurea concentrations in wwtp effluent they consider that guanylurea may have been formed from additional biguanide precursors in particular from disinfectants since 2007 fluoxetine exhibited significantly lower concentrations in koblenz spm 5 0 0 3 ng g d w than in weil 13 1 ng g d w fluoxetine consumption varied strongly between the countries of the rhine catchment area with 0 032 g capita in switzerland 0 062 g capita in france and 0 012 g capita in germany singer et al 2016 assuming a uniform pharmaceutical consumption of the people from the three countries swiss inhabitants have consumed about 240 kg fluoxetine up to weil whereas french and germans inhabitants have consumed 317 kg fluoxetine between weil and koblenz based on catchment area population reported by schlüsener et al 2015 thus since the fluoxetine discharge between weil and koblenz is adding to the one consumed before weil and that the dilution factor for fluoxetine between weil and koblenz is about 0 6 similar concentrations should be expected in koblenz in comparison to weil environmental dissipation is unlikely to play an important role since i fluoxetine is believed to be persistent in surface water kwon and armbrust 2006 ii in 2006 similar concentrations were indeed observed in weil 2 2 0 4 ng g d w and koblenz 2 0 0 2 ng g d w fig s4 consequently it can be hypothesized that higher concentrations of fluoxetine in spm measured in weil since 2007 are caused by specific industrial discharges of fluoxetine upstream of weil moreover from 2007 to 2014 fluoxetine shows higher concentrations in weil rhine than in rehlingen saar in spite of a much higher wastewater proportion of the river saar this further supports an additional industrial emissions of fluoxetine upstream of weil venlafaxine concentrations did also not correlate with the wastewater proportion since normalized concentrations were significantly higher in the rhine than in the saar fig 3 furthermore the ratio of o desmethyl venlafaxine to venlafaxine was much lower in rhine 0 3 in weil in 2006 compared to the saar 1 7 in rehlingen in 2006 this also indicates that industrial emissions upstream of weil contributed to a significant extent to the venlafaxine concentrations in the rivers since bisoprolol was not detected in spm taken in weil it is probably not used in appreciable quantities in switzerland bisoprolol concentration increased significantly in bimmen fig 3 in particular between koblenz and bimmen a strong increase of the carbamazepine normalized concentration was observed with a ratio increasing from 0 4 to 1 2 this might be an indication for an additional input probably by industrial discharge 3 3 2 temporal trends for most pharmaceuticals similar trends of the concentrations were observed at the different sampling locations from 2005 to 2015 as example the trends of four pharmaceuticals are shown in fig 4 the temporal trends for the other analytes are illustrated in fig s5 these four substances are representatives for the diversity of pharmaceuticals that were detected in spm i e medium polar to apolar substances such as carbamazepine or telmisartan but also polar positively charged analytes such as sitagliptin or aliskiren sitagliptin and aliskiren were already detected in rhine spm bimmen the year after their market authorization 2006 with concentrations of 0 40 0 07 and 5 0 0 4 ng g d w respectively fig 4 sitagliptin concentrations have strongly increased between 2006 and 2015 up to 49 3 ng g d w in 2015 in bimmen at the same sampling location aliskiren concentrations have increased up to 24 3 ng g d w in 2011 and declined subsequently down to 11 1 ng g d w in 2015 in the rhine telmisartan concentrations have increased until 2010 and were then relatively constant until 2015 nevertheless attaining 28 2 ng g d w in bimmen rhine in rehlingen saar telmisartan concentrations increased steadily between 2006 and 2015 reaching 120 30 ng g d w in 2015 carbamazepine concentrations have decreased between 2005 and 2015 in all locations being in 2015 as low as 0 7 0 2 ng g d w in weil rhein corresponding to a concentration decrease of 65 if the concentrations of metabolites and tps correlated mostly with those of their parent drugs fig s5 table s12 for pearson coefficients and p values there was most likely no major industrial discharge of their precursors upstream the sampling sites for instance desmethylcitalopram showed at each sampling location an excellent correlation with citalopram concentrations fig s6 all pearson coefficients 0 95 all p values 0 005 while o desmethyl venlafaxine did not correlate with the concentrations of its precursor at weil rhine and iffezheim rhine pearson coefficients 0 35 p values 0 29 but does at rehlingen saar pearson coefficient 0 99 p value 0 005 moreover at koblenz rhine and bimmen rhine its concentrations correlated to a lesser extent than at rehlingen saar table s12 this is a strong argument indicating an industrial discharge of venlafaxine in switzerland as already stated in section 3 3 1 tps having several precursors did not show a correlation with their parent drugs this was for example the case for acridone and 9 carboxyacridine which can be formed from oxcarbamabazepine 10 11 dihydroxy 10 11 dihydrocarbamazepine 10 11 dihydro 10 hydroxycarbamazepine in addition to carbamazepine brezina et al 2017 guanylurea also did not correlate with the metformin concentrations at any sampling locations table s12 probably due to an industrial discharge as stated above it has to be noted that the concentrations of many pharmaceuticals correlated well with the annual consumed quantities in germany table s13 for pearson coefficients and p values this was in particular the case for spm from koblenz and bimmen where respectively 52 and 63 of the analytes detected every year correlated p 0 05 pearson coefficients 0 6 with the german consumption at these locations the influence of different prescription behaviors in switzerland and france can be assumed as negligible since the proportion of effluents from german wwtps increases with distance from weil rhine for carbamazepine telmisartan sitagliptin and aliskiren for example excellent correlations could be determined at all sampling locations at the rhine with pearson coefficients 0 79 and p values 0 005 fig s7 table s13 for the compounds correlating well with the consumption data pearson coefficient 0 6 p value 0 05 the parameters of the linear correlation could be determined table s14 for all parameters based on these linear relationships the concentration in spm can be predicted from its consumption this is very interesting because these relationships consider parameters such as excretion average wwtp degradation and partly surface water degradation which are very difficult to predict from literature data in particularly for large scale scenarios however for certain pharmaceuticals there were no significant correlations between their spm concentrations and their german consumption this was the case for pharmaceuticals whose german annual consumption varied only slightly between 2005 and 2015 this is probably due to a higher influence of switzerland and french consumption variation fluoxetine and venlafaxine also showed relatively low correlations with the consumption in germany particularly in koblenz what is coherent with the presence of an industrial discharge postulated above metformin concentrations did not correlate with the consumption trends negative pearson coefficients at each sampling location for example in bimmen the concentration in spm has decreased from 64 6 ng g d w in 2005 to 37 4 ng g d w in 2015 whereas the german consumption has doubled in the same period a conceivable explanation is an adaptation of the microbial population of the wwtps to metformin causing increasing removal rates adaptation of the microbial population of the wwtps was already observed for acesulfame which is present in similar concentrations to that of metformin in effluent e g concentrations ranging from a few μg l to hundreds μg l kahle et al 2009 castronovo et al 2017 tisler and zwiener 2018 and related to an adaptation of the microbial sludge community caused by the high environmental concentrations castronovo et al 2017 moreover adaptation of the microbial population to metformin degradation was already observed at the laboratory scale by scheurer et al 2012 3 4 relevance of spm analysis as the water quantity of the rhine is about 50 000 times higher than that of spm concentrations ca 20 mg l for all substances with kd 500 l kg the sorbed fraction was negligible 1 in comparison to the dissolved percentage however for long term trend analysis an integrative sampling is essential sedimentation boxes enable continuous sampling over a longer period while a continuous sampling of the water is very challenging the methodology for the conservation of the spm samples over a long period is well established while this is not the case for water samples the stability of the spm samples is ensured by maintaining a consistent cold chain from the removal of spm from the sedimentations boxes to their lyophilization using an active cooling system to limit degradation their subsequent conservation within liquid nitrogen minimizes biological and chemical activities the collection of spm during one month raises issues about the stability of the analytes during this time however the good correlation of the analytes with their consumption data performed in this study indicates that the degradation is probably very low this is also supported by the correlations observed between the concentrations of the parent pharmaceuticals with their metabolites thus pharmaceutical concentrations at the same sampling location can be compared for a longer period however it cannot be ruled out that a comparison of two analytes is limited due to a different stability or the formation of non extractable residues thus more experiments with regard to stability and non extractable residues formation are recommended to widen the interpretation field of spm analysis this study shows that spm analysis is also successful for micropollutants with low kd such as carbamazepine 10 l kg positively charged compounds such as amisulpride log d of 0 08 could be detected in all spm samples due to a kd of 119 l kg although relatively low average water concentrations with 15 ng l were detected in koblenz in 2015 average of thirteen 28 day composite sample in certain cases compounds could be detected in spm but were frequently below loq in the water phase for example only 5 of sertraline was sorbed onto spm value estimated from the kd while its concentrations in surface water were seldom above the loq of 20 ng l on the contrary in spm sertraline could be detected at all sampling locations to conclude spm analysis is particularly relevant for the analysis of positively charged and relatively non polar pharmaceuticals such as sertraline or fluoxetine since these are rarely detected in the water phase 4 conclusion spm is appropriate to investigate the pollution status of a water systems with micropollutants even for relatively polar compounds for micropollutants with elevated sorption affinities kd 500 l kg the analysis of spm is recommended especially for trend analysis since lower emissions can be detected sorption of positively charged pharmaceuticals is significant due to the electrostatic interactions even for rather polar compounds such as guanylurea temporal trends between 2005 and 2015 revealed the ubiquitous presence of pharmaceuticals in spm of the river rhine and the river saar for many pharmaceuticals a distinct correlation was observed between the german pharmaceutical consumption and the concentrations detected in spm the monitoring of composite spm samples offers the opportunity to get hints about specific industrial discharges by comparing the pollution pattern along a river this

18188,although several studies confirmed a wide distribution of pharmaceuticals in rivers and streams a limited knowledge is available about the partitioning of pharmaceuticals between the water phase

up to 61 of the 100 analytes were detected with concentrations up to 190 ng g d w dry weight for guanylurea a transformation product of the antidiabetic metformin for most analytes increasing concentrations were found along the length of the rhine and higher concentrations were measured in rehlingen saar normalization of the data with the antiepileptic drug carbamazepine as an intrinsic

micropollutants partition between the water phase and suspended particulate matter spm turner and millward 2002 sorption reduces the mobility of micropollutants in the aquatic environment modifies their bioavailability and limits the biodegradation jonker and koelmans 2002 as a consequence knowledge about sorption affinities is crucial to understand the interactions between environmental compartments and to predict the loads of micropollutants sorbed on spm the sorption of pharmaceuticals on suspended particulate matter spm has been much less investigated than that of more hydrophobic micropollutants such as pcbs or pahs the few published studies stein et al 2008 ramil et al 2009 martinez hernandez et al 2014 yamamoto et al 2009 da silva et al 2011 concentrated on a limited number of selected pharmaceuticals frequently the ones with the elevated contamination levels detected in the water phase and not necessarily those with the higher sorption potential while more hydrophobic

pharmaceuticals lahti and oikari 2011 darwano et al 2014 wilkinson et al 2017 subedi and kannan 2015 to date two studies report the analysis of a higher number of pharmaceuticals da silva et al 2011 analyzed spm of ebro river basin spain and detected up to 31 of their 43 targeted pharmaceuticals with concentrations up to 571 ng g d w aminot et al 2015 investigated 53 pharmaceuticals in a periurban river of bordeaux france and detected up to 22 of 53 selected pharmaceuticals with concentrations up to 150 ng g d w in spm downstream of a wwtp however these studies did not include pharmaceuticals recently introduced to the market such as sitagliptin or aliskiren they are mainly focused on parent pharmaceuticals whereas metabolites or tps are rarely included in the past several authors have tried with variable success to correlate measured water concentrations with prescription data van nuijs et al 2015 oosterhuis et al 2013 ter laak et al 2010 however these studies were always limited by the lack of data in particularly regarding human excretion and degradation in wwtps to the best of our knowledge no relationship was reported between the human consumption and environmental concentrations detected over several years in the current study we developed a high throughput and sensitive analytical method via lc ms ms detection for the quantification of 100 pharmaceuticals metabolites and tps table s1 sorbed to spm the analytes were selected due to their environmental relevance as well as to cover a large range of polarity to the best of our knowledge more than 60 compounds were analyzed for the first time in spm table s2 the method could be easily extended to include further pharmaceutical compounds the method was applied to evaluate the partition coefficients of the pharmaceuticals between water and suspended matter and to elucidate the spatial distribution and temporal trends of pharmaceuticals sorbed to spm of 5 different sites in german

location in 2015 2 2 2 spm for the determination of temporal trends spm were sampled at four different sites of the river rhine weil km 173 iffezheim km 333 koblenz km 590 and bimmen km 863 and at one site of the river saar at rehlingen km 54 fig 1 the samples were obtained from the german environmental specimen bank located in schmallenberg germany sampling and preparation were described in detail by schulze et al 2007 briefly the samples were collected by sedimentation boxes permanently deployed and placed 0 5 2 m below water surface they were sampled each month and the spm were subsequently shock frozen in liquid nitrogen at the end of the year the samples of each month were combined to annual composite samples freeze dried and homogenized before storage in liquid nitrogen with a temperature below 150 c 2 3 consumption data german annual pharmaceutical consumption quantities 2005 2015 originated from iqvia ltd frankfurt am main germany were kindly provided by the german environment agency uba these consumption quantities comprised all pharmaceuticals sold in pharmacies including over the counter pharmaceuticals as well as the quantities delivered in hospitals and medical practices 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 water phase measurements water samples were filtered using a gf 6 glass fiber filters pore size 1 3 μm whatman ge healthcare chicago usa and split to be

corresponding lc ms parameters are described in detail in table s5 2 4 2 spm measurements sample extraction during method optimization several extraction experiments were performed first ultrasound extraction use and ple were compared with methanol milli q 1 1 v v as an extraction solvent for use three 15 min extraction cycles were run whereas for ple three cycles with a static time of 15 min were carried out at 80 c different extraction solvents were tested methanol milli q methanol 1 3 v v milli q methanol 1 1 v v and milli q methanol 3 1 v v and milli q milli q methanol 1 1 v v was selected the ph of the water phase was varied by addition of formic acid 0 2 2 v v or ammonium hydroxide 1 v v a variety of extraction temperatures 80 90 100 110 120 c were compared for the final analytical method spm was extracted by pressurized liquid extraction ple using an ase 350 thermo fisher scientific darmstadt germany exactly 0 5 g freeze dried spm was thoroughly mixed with quartz

the residues were thoroughly redissolved in 100 μl milli q water subsequently 900 μl acetonitrile was added to precipitate the co extracted impurities the sample extracts were centrifuged for 10 min

reversed phase adapted from hermes et al 2018 and ii hilic adapted from boulard et al 2018 they are described in detail in table s5 and ms specific parameters are given in tables s3 and s4 2 5 method performance and quantification quantification was performed by a 14 point calibration ranging from 0 5 ng l to 5000 ng l the quantification was based on a linear regression with a 1 x weighting factor if available internal standards were used to compensate matrix effects table s6 data processing was performed with the software multiquant 3 0 2 sciex darmstadt germany instrumental precision was determined by repeated injections of extracts of 10 ng g d w correspond to 167 ng l for rplc analytes and 333 ng l for hilic analytes and 50 ng g d w correspond to 833 ng l for rplc analytes and 1667 ng l for hilic analytes spiked spm on the same day n 6 and on four different days n 4 the accuracy of the method was verified by determining the recoveries at three different concentration levels 10 ng g d w 50 ng g d w and 100 ng g d w as no uncontaminated spm was available the original analyte concentrations were substracted prior to the calculation of the recoveries relative recoveries were calculated by normalizing the area of the analytes with that of the corresponding isotope labeled internal standard precision of the method was determined by calculating the 95 confidence interval of four separate spiked extracts the loq was defined as the concentration at which a signal to noise ratio s n of 10 is reached for the mrm transition used for quantification and a s n of 3 for the mrm transition used for confirmation matrix effects were determined by spiking samples after the extraction and comparing their analyte peak areas with those of a standard at the same concentration time trends were plotted using the loess method according to the approach developed by fryer and nicholson 1999 this method used a locally weighted regression smoother loess curves and their pointwise 95 confidence intervals were plotted using the ggplot2 package of the software r 3 5 0 cran 2 6 sorption experiments sorption experiments were performed largely according to oecd 106 oecd 2000 with freeze dried sediments from the rhine harbor ehrenbreitstein at koblenz rhine km 591 4 toc 3 9 see table s7 for the other characteristics the sorption isotherms were determined by two sediment water ratios 1 5 and 1 25 to ensure a distribution of the analytes between the liquid phase and the solid phase between 20 and 80 exactly 50 ml of 0 01 mol l cacl2 was equilibrated with 2 g 25 1 sediment water ratio or 10 g 5 1 sediment water ratio freeze dried sediments for 24 h using an orbital shaker ika ks260 200 min 1 analytes were spiked from 10 to 2000 ng in duplicate via a multi analyte stock solution the methanol content in the sample did not exceed 1 the samples were then agitated again for 24 h in the orbital shaker the time was sufficient to reach sorption equilibriums for the analytes data not shown afterwards both phases were separated and analyzed as described in section 2 4 for all analytes the mass balance could be determined due to the quantification of both sediment and water phases sorption isotherms were plotted for those 90 analytes showing closed mass balance 30 data not shown five concentration levels were spiked covering three orders of magnitude for each concentration level and each matrix the average of the duplicate analysis was plotted data processing was performed with the software r 3 5 0 cran the ph of the water phase varied between 6 9 and 7 9 3 results and discussion 3 1 analytical method the developed analytical method allows for a sensitive simultaneous detection of 100 pharmaceuticals metabolites and transformation products sorbed to spm loqs ranged from 0 09 clopidogrel to 11 7 ng g d w dehydrotramadol fig s1 a table s8 the accuracy of the method was determined at three different spiking levels 10 ng g d w 50 ng g d w and 100 ng g d w due to appreciable environmental concentrations present in spm of german rivers spiking levels at lower concentrations were not performed at all spiking levels the recoveries ranged from 70 acesulfame to 127 o desmethyl metoprolol except for 13 analytes which showed either slightly higher or slightly lower recoveries at one of the spike levels fig s1 b an acceptable precision was obtained with 95 confidence intervals ranging from 1 acesulfame to 29 sitagliptin for the majority of analytes table s8 matrix effects ranged from 77 sertraline ketone up to 365 aliskiren fig s1 c however they are successfully compensated by isotopically labeled surrogate standards even for aliskiren table s8 for more than 50 analytes a quantification without isotopically labeled standards would be sufficient fig s1 d in general the achieved loqs were comparable to those reported in literature utilizing a spe clean up aminot et al 2015 da silva et al 2011 baker and kasprzyk hordern 2011 alvarez ruiz et al 2015 in this study a solvent exchange was preferred as a clean up due to its unspecificity and high throughput an appropriate spe material would be very difficult to find since the selected analytes exhibit a broad range of polarities thus a reliable analytical method has been developed enabling the quantification of 100 pharmaceuticals metabolites and transformation products sorbed to spm for the optimization of the extraction method ple and use ultrasound extraction were compared using methanol milli q 1 1 as extraction solvent on this basis ple was selected since all analytes except diclofenac and lamotrigine showed higher recoveries than with use fig s2 a for the optimization of the ple extraction solvent different ratios of methanol milli q were tested overall best recoveries were obtained with methanol milli q 1 1 fig s2 b the addition of ammonium hydroxide to the extraction solvent did not provide any significant improvement fig s2 c while the addition of formic acid improved the recoveries of positively charged analytes but decreased those of others in particular valsartan sulfamethaxole and candesartan highest recoveries for the positively charged analytes were obtained with methanol 2 formic acid 1 1 v v fig s2 d as a consequence in the final analytical extraction method both methanol milli q 1 1 and methanol 2 formic acid 1 1 v v were applied this combination ensured the highest overall extraction efficiencies see fig s2 e extraction temperature was varied between 80 and 120 c in general the extraction recoveries improved with higher temperatures this was particularly the case for positively charged analytes such as citalopram whose extraction recoveries increased from 32 14 80 c to 100 26 100 c certain analytes such as diphenhydramine or hydrochlorothiazide exhibited a thermal degradation at temperatures above 110 c as no significant improvement of the extraction efficiencies was observed above 100 c an extraction temperature of 100 c was selected see fig s2 f 3 2 sorption all selected compounds exhibited almost linear sorption isotherms with freundlich n values ranging from 0 87 to 1 17 table s9 hence sorption affinity could be described by the partition coefficient kd to ensure reliable partition coefficients we measured the analytes in both the water and sediment phases and calculated the partition coefficients only when the mass balance was closed within an uncertainty of 30 these conditions were fulfilled by 90 analytes due to the high difference in polarity and pka values the kd values ranged from 0 64 l kg acesulfame to 9300 l kg diphenhydramine the obtained kd values were comparable with those reported in literature table s10 exact 41 analytes showed partition coefficients below 10 l kg for 31 the kd ranged between 10 and 100 l kg and for 18 analytes kd above 100 l kg were determined fig 2 kd values freundlich affinity parameters kf and exponents n determined by plotting the sorption isotherms and the logarithmic sorption isotherms are summarized in table s9 in general positively charged analytes showed higher kd values than the neutral and negatively charged substances fig s3 all analytes with kd 800 l kg sitagliptin were positively charged at ph 7 moreover guanylurea a polar and positively charged molecule log d at ph 7 3 9 exhibited a similar kd value 14 0 0 1 l kg as the considerably less polar but non charged carbamazepine 10 0 0 2 l kg log d at ph 7 2 8 franco and trapp 2008 reported a higher sorption affinity of protonated compounds than of neutral or negatively charged substances it can be assumed that positively charged analytes are susceptible to a higher sorption via cation exchange and surface complexation or cation bridging on negatively charged surface sites of organic matter and clay minerals mackay and vasudevan 2012 droge and goss 2013 3 3 concentration trends 3 3 1 occurrence and spatial distribution of pharmaceuticals bound to spm between 2005 and 2015 temporal trends of pharmaceuticals as well as their metabolites and tps were determined in spm taken from five different sampling sites of german rivers see table s11 for the toc values the number of analytes and their concentrations detected in spm increased with an increasing portion of wastewater as a consequence in the saar at rehlingen up to 61 analytes were found about 15 wastewater 1 1 wastewater proportion were estimated from the wastewater proportions in koblenz rhine 5 schlüsener et al 2015 and the carbamazepine concentrations at the different sampling locations while in spm sampled along the rhine up to 24 analytes were detected in weil about 2 wastewater 1 and up to 42 analytes in bimmen about 7 wastewater 1 maximal concentrations were determined for guanylurea a tp of the antidiabetic metformin trautwein and kümmerer 2011 with concentrations of 190 6 ng g d w in the saar rehlingen and 160 6 ng g d w in the rhine bimmen to the best of our knowledge this is the first time that the occurrence of guanylurea in spm is described the analytes showing the highest concentrations 10 ng g were either positively charged or more hydrophobic log d 4 the few exceptions acesulfame leveritacetam acid and valsartan correspond to substances whose consumption was relatively high 100 t pro year iqvia ltd 2017 midas database frankfurt am main germany a comparison of the concentrations measured in spm of the saar and the rhine helps to identify emissions from pharmaceutical industries as those are very rarely located in the saar catchment area in comparison to the rhine catchment thus municipal wastewater effluents are in nearly all cases the major source of pharmaceutical emissions in the saar in order to distinguish the impact of municipal wastewater and direct or indirect industrial discharge concentrations in spm were normalized by the detected carbamazepine concentrations the antiepileptic carbamazepine is well described in the literature as a marker of municipal wastewater due to its persistence and ubiquitous presence in rivers and streams containing appreciable portions of wwtp effluents ternes 1998 kahle et al 2009 scheurer et al 2011 the concentrations of sitagliptin and sotalol at the different sampling locations of the rhine and in the saar at rehlingen are shown in fig 3 for both pharmaceuticals the concentrations increased along the rhine due to an increasing wastewater proportion in rehlingen saar with the highest portion of wwtp effluents the highest concentrations of the selected analytes were found the concentrations normalized with the carbamazepine concentrations were relatively constant over the five sampling sites at the rhine indicating that effluents of municipal wwtps are the main source a similar behavior was found for most analytes such as cetirizine or amisulpride in contrast to sitagliptin and sotalol spm concentrations of guanylurea a tp of metformin decrease along the rhine from weil to koblenz fig 3 for example in 2009 119 8 ng g d w of guanylurea were measured in rhine spm at weil in comparison to 71 6 ng g d w of guanylurea downstream in koblenz this difference cannot be caused by different consumption behaviors in the three major countries of the southern rhine catchment area switzerland france germany since similar consumptions for metformin the guanylurea precursor were reported in 2009 with 9 6 g capita for switzerland 12 g capita for france and 12 g capita for germany singer et al 2016 furthermore despite a seven times higher wastewater proportion similar concentrations were found in rehlingen saar 124 7 ng g d w and weil rhine 119 8 ng g d w this is particularly emphasized by the difference of carbamazepine normalized concentrations which reached a ratio of 106 23 in weil in comparison to a ratio of 17 2 in rehlingen saar therefore we assumed that probably a significant industrial discharge of guanylurea upstream weil is causing the different ratios contrary to guanylurea the concentrations of its precursor metformin are proportional to the wastewater proportion fig 3 the guanylurea metformin ratio decreases strongly along the rhine varying for example in 2009 from 9 8 in weil to 3 6 in bimmen two possible explanations may explain this observation i metformin is quantitatively transformed to guanylurea in the wwtps through which the discharge occurs this is however relatively unlikely since quantitative transformation of metformin to guanylurea was to date only observed during long term laboratory experiments tisler and zwiener 2019 ii the discharged guanylurea did not originate from metformin but from other precursors the existence of other precursors than metformin for guanylurea was already hypothesized by tisler and zwiener 2018 to explain high guanylurea concentrations in wwtp effluent they consider that guanylurea may have been formed from additional biguanide precursors in particular from disinfectants since 2007 fluoxetine exhibited significantly lower concentrations in koblenz spm 5 0 0 3 ng g d w than in weil 13 1 ng g d w fluoxetine consumption varied strongly between the countries of the rhine catchment area with 0 032 g capita in switzerland 0 062 g capita in france and 0 012 g capita in germany singer et al 2016 assuming a uniform pharmaceutical consumption of the people from the three countries swiss inhabitants have consumed about 240 kg fluoxetine up to weil whereas french and germans inhabitants have consumed 317 kg fluoxetine between weil and koblenz based on catchment area population reported by schlüsener et al 2015 thus since the fluoxetine discharge between weil and koblenz is adding to the one consumed before weil and that the dilution factor for fluoxetine between weil and koblenz is about 0 6 similar concentrations should be expected in koblenz in comparison to weil environmental dissipation is unlikely to play an important role since i fluoxetine is believed to be persistent in surface water kwon and armbrust 2006 ii in 2006 similar concentrations were indeed observed in weil 2 2 0 4 ng g d w and koblenz 2 0 0 2 ng g d w fig s4 consequently it can be hypothesized that higher concentrations of fluoxetine in spm measured in weil since 2007 are caused by specific industrial discharges of fluoxetine upstream of weil moreover from 2007 to 2014 fluoxetine shows higher concentrations in weil rhine than in rehlingen saar in spite of a much higher wastewater proportion of the river saar this further supports an additional industrial emissions of fluoxetine upstream of weil venlafaxine concentrations did also not correlate with the wastewater proportion since normalized concentrations were significantly higher in the rhine than in the saar fig 3 furthermore the ratio of o desmethyl venlafaxine to venlafaxine was much lower in rhine 0 3 in weil in 2006 compared to the saar 1 7 in rehlingen in 2006 this also indicates that industrial emissions upstream of weil contributed to a significant extent to the venlafaxine concentrations in the rivers since bisoprolol was not detected in spm taken in weil it is probably not used in appreciable quantities in switzerland bisoprolol concentration increased significantly in bimmen fig 3 in particular between koblenz and bimmen a strong increase of the carbamazepine normalized concentration was observed with a ratio increasing from 0 4 to 1 2 this might be an indication for an additional input probably by industrial discharge 3 3 2 temporal trends for most pharmaceuticals similar trends of the concentrations were observed at the different sampling locations from 2005 to 2015 as example the trends of four pharmaceuticals are shown in fig 4 the temporal trends for the other analytes are illustrated in fig s5 these four substances are representatives for the diversity of pharmaceuticals that were detected in spm i e medium polar to apolar substances such as carbamazepine or telmisartan but also polar positively charged analytes such as sitagliptin or aliskiren sitagliptin and aliskiren were already detected in rhine spm bimmen the year after their market authorization 2006 with concentrations of 0 40 0 07 and 5 0 0 4 ng g d w respectively fig 4 sitagliptin concentrations have strongly increased between 2006 and 2015 up to 49 3 ng g d w in 2015 in bimmen at the same sampling location aliskiren concentrations have increased up to 24 3 ng g d w in 2011 and declined subsequently down to 11 1 ng g d w in 2015 in the rhine telmisartan concentrations have increased until 2010 and were then relatively constant until 2015 nevertheless attaining 28 2 ng g d w in bimmen rhine in rehlingen saar telmisartan concentrations increased steadily between 2006 and 2015 reaching 120 30 ng g d w in 2015 carbamazepine concentrations have decreased between 2005 and 2015 in all locations being in 2015 as low as 0 7 0 2 ng g d w in weil rhein corresponding to a concentration decrease of 65 if the concentrations of metabolites and tps correlated mostly with those of their parent drugs fig s5 table s12 for pearson coefficients and p values there was most likely no major industrial discharge of their precursors upstream the sampling sites for instance desmethylcitalopram showed at each sampling location an excellent correlation with citalopram concentrations fig s6 all pearson coefficients 0 95 all p values 0 005 while o desmethyl venlafaxine did not correlate with the concentrations of its precursor at weil rhine and iffezheim rhine pearson coefficients 0 35 p values 0 29 but does at rehlingen saar pearson coefficient 0 99 p value 0 005 moreover at koblenz rhine and bimmen rhine its concentrations correlated to a lesser extent than at rehlingen saar table s12 this is a strong argument indicating an industrial discharge of venlafaxine in switzerland as already stated in section 3 3 1 tps having several precursors did not show a correlation with their parent drugs this was for example the case for acridone and 9 carboxyacridine which can be formed from oxcarbamabazepine 10 11 dihydroxy 10 11 dihydrocarbamazepine 10 11 dihydro 10 hydroxycarbamazepine in addition to carbamazepine brezina et al 2017 guanylurea also did not correlate with the metformin concentrations at any sampling locations table s12 probably due to an industrial discharge as stated above it has to be noted that the concentrations of many pharmaceuticals correlated well with the annual consumed quantities in germany table s13 for pearson coefficients and p values this was in particular the case for spm from koblenz and bimmen where respectively 52 and 63 of the analytes detected every year correlated p 0 05 pearson coefficients 0 6 with the german consumption at these locations the influence of different prescription behaviors in switzerland and france can be assumed as negligible since the proportion of effluents from german wwtps increases with distance from weil rhine for carbamazepine telmisartan sitagliptin and aliskiren for example excellent correlations could be determined at all sampling locations at the rhine with pearson coefficients 0 79 and p values 0 005 fig s7 table s13 for the compounds correlating well with the consumption data pearson coefficient 0 6 p value 0 05 the parameters of the linear correlation could be determined table s14 for all parameters based on these linear relationships the concentration in spm can be predicted from its consumption this is very interesting because these relationships consider parameters such as excretion average wwtp degradation and partly surface water degradation which are very difficult to predict from literature data in particularly for large scale scenarios however for certain pharmaceuticals there were no significant correlations between their spm concentrations and their german consumption this was the case for pharmaceuticals whose german annual consumption varied only slightly between 2005 and 2015 this is probably due to a higher influence of switzerland and french consumption variation fluoxetine and venlafaxine also showed relatively low correlations with the consumption in germany particularly in koblenz what is coherent with the presence of an industrial discharge postulated above metformin concentrations did not correlate with the consumption trends negative pearson coefficients at each sampling location for example in bimmen the concentration in spm has decreased from 64 6 ng g d w in 2005 to 37 4 ng g d w in 2015 whereas the german consumption has doubled in the same period a conceivable explanation is an adaptation of the microbial population of the wwtps to metformin causing increasing removal rates adaptation of the microbial population of the wwtps was already observed for acesulfame which is present in similar concentrations to that of metformin in effluent e g concentrations ranging from a few μg l to hundreds μg l kahle et al 2009 castronovo et al 2017 tisler and zwiener 2018 and related to an adaptation of the microbial sludge community caused by the high environmental concentrations castronovo et al 2017 moreover adaptation of the microbial population to metformin degradation was already observed at the laboratory scale by scheurer et al 2012 3 4 relevance of spm analysis as the water quantity of the rhine is about 50 000 times higher than that of spm concentrations ca 20 mg l for all substances with kd 500 l kg the sorbed fraction was negligible 1 in comparison to the dissolved percentage however for long term trend analysis an integrative sampling is essential sedimentation boxes enable continuous sampling over a longer period while a continuous sampling of the water is very challenging the methodology for the conservation of the spm samples over a long period is well established while this is not the case for water samples the stability of the spm samples is ensured by maintaining a consistent cold chain from the removal of spm from the sedimentations boxes to their lyophilization using an active cooling system to limit degradation their subsequent conservation within liquid nitrogen minimizes biological and chemical activities the collection of spm during one month raises issues about the stability of the analytes during this time however the good correlation of the analytes with their consumption data performed in this study indicates that the degradation is probably very low this is also supported by the correlations observed between the concentrations of the parent pharmaceuticals with their metabolites thus pharmaceutical concentrations at the same sampling location can be compared for a longer period however it cannot be ruled out that a comparison of two analytes is limited due to a different stability or the formation of non extractable residues thus more experiments with regard to stability and non extractable residues formation are recommended to widen the interpretation field of spm analysis this study shows that spm analysis is also successful for micropollutants with low kd such as carbamazepine 10 l kg positively charged compounds such as amisulpride log d of 0 08 could be detected in all spm samples due to a kd of 119 l kg although relatively low average water concentrations with 15 ng l were detected in koblenz in 2015 average of thirteen 28 day composite sample in certain cases compounds could be detected in spm but were frequently below loq in the water phase for example only 5 of sertraline was sorbed onto spm value estimated from the kd while its concentrations in surface water were seldom above the loq of 20 ng l on the contrary in spm sertraline could be detected at all sampling locations to conclude spm analysis is particularly relevant for the analysis of positively charged and relatively non polar pharmaceuticals such as sertraline or fluoxetine since these are rarely detected in the water phase 4 conclusion spm is appropriate to investigate the pollution status of a water systems with micropollutants even for relatively polar compounds for micropollutants with elevated sorption affinities kd 500 l kg the analysis of spm is recommended especially for trend analysis since lower emissions can be detected sorption of positively charged pharmaceuticals is significant due to the electrostatic interactions even for rather polar compounds such as guanylurea temporal trends between 2005 and 2015 revealed the ubiquitous presence of pharmaceuticals in spm of the river rhine and the river saar for many pharmaceuticals a distinct correlation was observed between the german pharmaceutical consumption and the concentrations detected in spm the monitoring of composite spm samples offers the opportunity to get hints about specific industrial discharges by comparing the pollution pattern along a river this

successfully applied in the nitrogen removal from high strength wastewaters however little information is available for its treatment of low strength wastewaters in this study a famine anammox nitrogen removal fanir system was developed to investigate the effect of long term substrate starvation at the low nitrogen concentration the influent total nitrogen was set at 1 mg l the results showed that the response of fanir system to the starvation stress took on two phases the functional decline phase 0 54 day and the functional stabilization phase 62 116 day over the two phases the nitrogen removal rate nrr of anammox reactor firstly dropped sharply and then came to a constant level the activity and settleability of anammox granular sludge angs firstly deteriorated seriously and then stayed in a stable range the relative abundance of anaerobic ammonium oxidation bacteria anaob firstly decreased markedly and then approached a steady state with the change of dominant genus from candidatus brocadia to candidatus kuenenia the abundance of 16s rrna gene and hzs gene of anaob and their transcription level firstly declined largely as well and then became stable with the 16s rrna gene hzs gene 16s rrna and hzs mrna of anaob at 23 9 9 1 1 2 and 1 0 of the initial value respectively to our delight the behavior of fanir system in the functional stabilization phase was proved indeed consistent with the feature for anaob to enter the dormancy state these findings are helpful to understand the physiology of anaob over the starvation stress and to promote the extension of anammox process to the treatment of low strength wastewaters graphical abstract image 1 keywords famine anammox nitrogen removal system anammox granular sludge anaerobic ammonium oxidation bacteria starvation stress bacterial dormancy 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is a biological reaction with ammonium as electron donor and nitrite as electron acceptor kuenen 2008 jetten et al 2005 and the nitrogen removal process based on this reaction is called anammox process compared with traditional nitrification denitrification process anammox process has the advantages of no requirement for the external electron donor high nitrogen loading rate and low operation cost it was favored in the field of environmental engineering once it came out fux and siegrist 2004 nowadays around 200 facilities have been put into operation all over the world showing the broad prospects for the biotechnological development cao et al 2017 anaerobic ammonium oxidation bacteria anaob are the functional source of anammox process jin et al 2012 in the anammox granular sludge angs bed system anaob and its associated bacteria mainly exist in the form of granular sludge tang et al 2010 and anaob could be effectively retained in the reaction system due to the good settleability of angs thus endowing the reaction system with the high rate nitrogen removal capacity lu et al 2012 it s reported that the highest nitrogen removal rate nrr could reach 70 0 kg n m3 d in the lab scale reactor tang et al 2011 nowadays angs biotechnology has been widely applied in the treatment of high strength nitrogen wastewaters lackner et al 2014 and the treatment of mainstream wastewater has also become a research hotspot which attained great attention cao et al 2016 besides it has been reported that eutrophication occurs once the total nitrogen exceeds 0 8 mg l xu et al 2014 even though the nitrogen concentration meets the discharge standard of municipal wastewaters its risk to cause the eutrophication of waterbodies still remains so the advanced anammox nitrogen removal aanr process has been proposed recently which focuses on the effluent refining to further reduce ecological risks li et al 2019 however some great challenges have to be faced for the development of angs biotechnology in this field in which the starvation stress of low substrate concentration on anaob is an urgent issue anaob are the basic function unit of angs the anaob community immobilized in angs determines the performance of angs and the capacity of angs bed system previous studies showed that the starvation stress could exert a serious influence on the anammox activity of anaob culture even leading to the loss of anammox activity ma et al 2017 li et al 2019 besides it could also cause the disintegration of angs and the washout of anaob resulting in the instability or collapse of anammox system ali et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 however most of previous studies were carried out in the batch experiments which are different from the commonly used continuous flow systems wang et al 2018 and little is known about the influence of starvation stress on the performance of continuous flow anammox system therefore it is necessary to investigate on the response of continuous flow anammox system to long term starvation for the extension of anammox system to the treatment of low strength wastewaters in addition it s worth noting that anaob widely existed in the oligotrophic habitats where the substrate is often in short supply and anaob must manage the starvation kartal et al 2013 oshiki et al 2016 and zhu et al 2019 found that anaob could survive several years under the natural starvation condition besides wang et al 2016 have successfully recovered the anammox culture starved for 6 months indicating that anaob have the potential to survive in the starvation condition zhu et al 2019 in 1982 xu et al 1982 first reported that e coli and vibrio cholerae could enter the dormacy state when stressed by adverse conditions it has been demonstrated that dormant bacteria stop the growth and reproduction exhibit the low metabolic activity but survive a long time hoehler and jørgensen 2013 zhu et al 2015 the dormant bacteria can resuscitate once the environmental conditions become favorable zhu et al 2019 among the adverse conditions the starvation stress has been recognized as the commonest dormancy inducing condition trevors 2011 therefore it s speculated that the starvation stress of low substrate concentration could induce anaob into the dormancy state showing a low anammox activity up to now however little information can be found about the relationship between starvation stress anaob dormancy and the performance of anammox system in this study a famine anammox nitrogen removal fanir system was developed from a continuous flow angs bed reactor that had worked at the steady state for over 1 year the fanir system was operated under the starvation condition to investigate the effect of long term 120 days substrate starvation mainly including 1 the performance of fanir system at the low substrate concentration 2 the change of angs over the substrate starvation 3 the succession of microbial community in angs 4 the variation of cell number and metabolic activity of anaob the objective of this study was to reveal the response of fanir system to the long term substrate starvation and to provide some information for the extension of anammox process to the treatment of low strength wastewaters 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor operation the anammox reactor fig 1 was made of plexiglass column with an internal diameter of 4 cm the total and effective volume were 3 7 l and 1 0 l respectively the reactor possessed a large height to diameter ratio of 20 with the superficial upflow rate of about 4 4 m h kang et al 2018 the synthetic wastewater served as the influent and the composition was shown in table s1 the operation temperature was set at 32 1 c the influent ph was controlled at 7 2 7 5 the hydraulic retention time hrt was kept at a constant of 1 6 h to simulate the starvation condition the fanir system was operated with influent ammonium and nitrite both at 0 5 mg l other operating parameters remained unchanged 2 2 saa determination the n2 production rate was determined to characterize the saa of angs dapena mora et al 2007 the batch tests were performed in serum bottles with a total volume of 75 ml and loaded with 50 ml solution after the pretreatment each serum bottle was inoculated with 1 g wet

information wang et al 2019 3 results 3 1 performance of fanir system a famine anammox nitrogen removal fanir system was established from a lab scale continuous flow angs bed reactor that had worked at the steady state for over 1 year before this starvation experiment kang et al 2019b the angs bed reactor was operated under following conditions influent ammonium and nitrite of 150 12 mg l and 167 17 mg l and nitrogen loading rate nlr of 5 03 0 34 kg n m3 d as shown in fig 2 over the starvation stress the response of fanir system could be divided into two phases i e the functional decline phase and the functional stabilization phase according to the time course of nitrogen removal rate nrr in the functional decline phase 0 54 day the nrr of fanir system dropped from 4 92 kg n m3 d the normal phase before the starvation to 16 6 10 3 kg n m3 d and further to 8 45 10 3 kg n m3 d the effluent total nitrogen dropped from 7 78 mg l to 0 022 mg l then rose to 1 61 mg l fig s2 the nitrogen removal efficiency nre increased from 88 7 to 97 9 then decreased sharply to 48 8 in the functional stabilization phase 62 116 day the nrr effluent total nitrogen and nre stayed at 7 97 2 10 10 3 kg n m3 d 0 50 0 09 mg l and 47 7 12 2 respectively f fcritical table 1 3 2 change of anammox granular sludge 3 2 1 function change of angs anaob can self select self combine and self immobilize functional bacteria to form angs which endows angs with the high activity and good settleability and thus supports the reactor performance the activity substrate conversion rate can be characterized by the specific anammox activity saa dapena mora et al 2007 and the settleability can be characterized by the settling velocity lu et al 2012 as shown in fig 3 a the saa was severely affected when the angs suffered from the long term starvation during 0 62 day the saa decreased from 630 61 μmol n2 g vss h to 47 9 9 1 μmol n2 g vss h which was only 7 60 of the initial value the decreasing rate of saa was 0 079 d 1 during 80 116 day the saa even fell below the detection limit no dinitrogen gas increment was detected within 6 h of batch tests f fcritical table 1 as shown in fig 3b during 0 54 day the vss concentration declined from 15 4 2 4 g vss l to 6 21 1 30 g vss l 40 3 of the initial value the decreasing rate of vss was 0 017 d 1 during 62 116 day the vss concentration became constant at 4 73 0 13 g vss l which was 30 7 of the initial value f fcritical table 1 as shown in fig 4 the settling velocity of angs declined markedly over the entire experimental period during 0 80 day the settling velocity dropped from 82 1 9 6 m h to 32 0 6 3 m h which was 39 0 of the initial value during 94 110 day the settling velocity became stable at 24 7 4 1 m h 30 1 of the initial value 3 2 2 physicochemical properties of angs the function of angs is closely related to its physicochemical properties xu et al 2019a in order to further understand the effect of long term starvation on the function of angs the physicochemical properties of angs were also determined particle size distribution particle size is an important physical property of angs which is related to the mass transfer and settling velocity of angs zhu et al 2018 using qicpic dynamic image analysis system the particle size distribution and volume surface mean diameter vmd were measured over the entire starvation period shown in fig 5 a based on particle size angs could be divided into 5 groups 200 μm i 200 500 μm ii 500 1000 μm iii 1000 2000 μm iv and 2000 μm v during 0 45 day group iv and v accounted for the top proportion 80 during 54 116 day group iii and iv accounted for the top proportion 70 and the proportion of group i and ii increased indicating that starvation led to the disaggregation of angs beyond our expectation the size distribution of angs was relatively stable during 80 116 day the average particle size of angs was characterized by the volume surface mean diameter vmd xu et al 2019a during 0 72 day the vmd of angs decreased from 2065 0 μm to 1271 3 μm which was 61 6 of the initial value during 80 116 day the vmd of angs stayed constantly at 895 7 μm 43 4 of the initial value fig 5a observed under the stereoscope angs was irregular with uneven surface the structure of angs was dense and compact at the beginning of starvation while the morphology of angs became spherical or ellipsoidal with loose structure after the long term starvation fig 4 eps content eps is a vital component of angs mainly composed of proteins pn and polysaccharides ps tang et al 2011 as a binder between cells it is related to the formation and maintenance of angs and as a nutrient it is related to the nitrogen removal capacity serving as electron donor for denitrification and the survival of functional bacteria in angs serving as energy source hou et al 2015 jia et al 2017 the variation of pn and ps two macro components of eps over the long term substrate starvation was shown in fig 5b overall the eps content demonstrated a descending trend indicating that starvation stress led to the eps consumption the consumption of pn was more than that of ps resulting in the large decrease of pn ps during 80 110 day the eps content became relatively constant with a final value of 37 1 of the initial the correlation analysis indicated that the vmd of angs had a significantly positive correlation with the eps content r 0 91 p 0 05 the lower the eps content the smaller the vmd fig 5c on one hand this result confirmed the bonding function of eps in the formation and maintenance of angs on the other hand it also confirmed the disintegration effect of angs after the eps was consumed over the substrate starvation the large fraction decreased while the small fraction increased 3 3 microbial community the 16s rrna gene high throughput sequencing was used to analysis the evolution of microbial community over the long term starvation at the phylum level the main microbial phyla were planctomycetes chloroflexi proteobacteria and bacteroidetes which accounted for more than 80 fig 6 a the relative abundance of planctomycetes which contained anaob decreased sharply over the entire starvation period during 0 62 day the relative abundance decreased from 49 9 to 15 6 during 80 110 day it stabilized at 9 1 1 6 chloroflexi is commonly observed in the autotrophic nitrogen removal system and it is supposed to be able to degrade dissolved organic matters extracellular polymer and dead biomass kindaichi et al 2012 lawson et al 2017 the relative abundance of chloroflexi increased obviously and finally stabilized at 33 5 2 8 which possibly received the support of cellular matters from the lysis of anaob at the genus level fig 6b as anaob candidatus brocadia candidatus kuenenia candidatus jettenia and brocadiaceae unclassified were detected during the entire starvation period the relative abundance of anaob genus demonstrated a descending trend but it became stable during 80 110 days with the total proportion of anaob at 5 4 0 8 the dominant population changed from candidatus brocadia supposed to be eutrophic to candidatus kuenenia supposed to be oligotrophic the species diversity indices indicated that the microbial community diversity of angs increased over the long term starvation table s4 3 4 anaerobic ammonium oxidation bacteria 3 4 1 morphology of anaob anaob have a unique cell compartment structure which is divided into three parts paryphoplasm riboplasm and anammoxosome the intact cellular structure is necessary for anaob to maintain metabolic function van niftrik et al 2008 sem and tem were applied to observe the morphology of anaob over the starvation stress before the starvation the anaob cells were full of the angs the individual cell was large the cell surface was covered by the large amount of eps the cell wall was slightly invaginated like a shallow crater the clear compartments were observed inside the cell the glycogen particles were seen in the riboplasm fig 7 a a xu et al 2019b during the functional decline phase the number of anaob cells decreased in the angs the individual cell shrank in size the amount of eps declined on the cellular surface some deep crater like structures were observed on the cell wall some flexures of cell membrane disappeared the cellular compartments became vague the number of glycogen particles decreased in the riboplasm while that of anammoxosome increased in the cytoplasm fig 7b at the same time many anaob cells died and disintegrated fig s3 during the functional stabilization phase the number of survival anaob cells remained relatively stable in the angs the individual cell became constant in size the eps around the cell almost disappeared deep crater like structures were observed on the cell wall some flexures of cell membrane disappeared the cellular compartments became vague no glycogen particles were observed the anammoxosome deformed severely with a volume accounted for over 90 of cell fig 7b c d in general the morphology of anaob cells tended to be stable during this phase it is worth noting that some black particles with a diameter of about 100 nm appeared inside the anammoxosome fig 7c d which was speculated to have something to do with the starvation stress 3 4 2 number and metabolic activity of anaob the abundance of 16s rrna gene and hzs gene and their transcription level were determined to characterize the number and metabolic activity of anaob over the entire starvation period as shown in fig 8 a during 0 54 days the 16s rrna gene copies of anaob declined from 4 13 0 34 1011 copies g vss to 1 85 0 10 1011 copies g vss which was 44 8 of the initial value during 62 116 days however the 16s rrna gene copies became constant with the final value of 9 87 0 60 1010 copies g vss which was 23 9 of the initial value f fcritical table 1 correspondingly during 0 54 days the 16s rrna copies of anaob dropped from 1 14 0 10 1013 copies g vss to 7 31 2 00 1011 copies g vss 6 4 of the initial value during 62 116 days the 16s rrna copies became stable with the final value of 1 32 0 13 1011 copies g vss 1 2 of the initial value f fcritical table 1 it is worth noting that during 62 116 days the ratio of 16s rrna copies to 16s rrna gene copies of anaob also became stable with the final value of 1 33 0 06 which was 5 4 of the initial value f fcritical table 1 as shown in fig 8b the change of hzs gene copies and its transcription level was consistent with that of 16s rrna gene during 0 54 days the hzs gene copies decreased from 1 01 0 21 1012 copies g vss to 2 77 0 06 1011 copies g vss 27 4 of the initial value during 62 116 days the hzs gene became constant with the final value of 9 22 0 29 1010 copies g vss 9 1 of the initial value f fcritical table 1 at the same time 0 54 days the hzs mrna copies dropped from 5 87 0 25 1011 copies g vss to 2 72 0 11 1010 copies g vss 4 6 of the initial value during 62 116 days the hzs mrna copies became stable with the final value of 6 02 0 52 109 copies g vss 1 0 of the initial value f fcritical table 1 to our delight during the 62 116 days the ratio of hzs gene copies to hzs mrna was also stable with the final value of 5 32 0 46 10 2 8 9 of the initial value f fcritical table 1 4 discussion a fanir system was established from a lab scale angs bed reactor that had worked at the steady state for over 1 year the fanir system was operated with the continuous flow for about 120 days in this experiment and the influent total nitrogen concentration was set around 1 mg l which approached the low concentration limit xu et al 2014 li et al 2019 the response of fanir system to the low substrate concentration can help to understand the physiology of anaob over the starvation stress and to provide some important information for the development of anammox process to treat low strength wastewaters 4 1 response of fanir system to substrate starvation after the influent ammonium and nitrite decreased from the normal level 150 12 mg l and 167 17 mg l to the low level 0 5 mg l and 0 5 mg l the nrr of fanir system fell to the low value 16 6 10 3 kg n m3 d and then stayed at the low level which matched with the nlr however the substrate starvation could give rise to the disintegration of angs and the washout of anaob leading to the further decline of nrr fig 2 this was consistent with the results reported in previous literatures wu et al 2015 li et al 2019 anaob are the functional source of fanir system anaob form angs by themselves with the aid of eps angs endowed its microbial community with the activity and settleability supporting the performance of fanir system tang et al 2017 to sustain the life anaob require the maintenance energy under the starvation condition the substrate could not provide anaob with enough maintenance energy ma et al 2017 anaob had to consume eps as energy source causing the disintegration of angs and the dispersal of microbial community wang et al 2013 chen and jin 2017 to our surprise the nrr of fanir system stayed at a low level but did not disappeared over the 2 month starvation fig 2 4 2 the dormancy state of anaerobic ammonium oxidation bacteria the metabolic process of anaob included anabolism and catabolism when anabolism exceeded catabolism anaob grew conversely anaob decayed oshiki et al 2016 li et al 2019 biological loading rate blr the ratio of substrate supply velocity to biomass played a key role in regulating the balance between anabolism and catabolism thus affecting the growth and decay of anaob cells the functional bacteria exhibited a phenotype at a blr and based on this the up regulation of blr would enhance the phenotype of functional bacteria while the down regulation of blr would weaken the phenotype rittmann and mccarty 2012 kang et al 2019b over the substrate starvation at a low blr the functional bacteria cells did not grow well with a small size light weight simplified structure and weakened metabolism hoehler and jørgensen 2013 when the starvation stress was intensified the functional bacteria cells would decompose the redundant cellular components to provide nutrients especially energy kartal et al 2013 when the energy available exhausted the functional bacteria cells entered the dormancy state which stopped growth and proliferation but retained the low activity wang et al 2016 zhu et al 2019 enzymes are catalysts of cellular metabolism and regulators of biological process lodish et al 2008 since ribosome is the molecular machine of enzyme synthesis so enzyme synthesis is largely dependent on the number of ribosomes generally the more the number of ribosomes the higher the cellular activity lengeler et al 1999 therefore the metabolic activity of cell can be characterized by the number of ribosomes rrna is the main component of ribosomes which accounts for more than 60 of the ribosomes mass simonović and steitz 2009 so rrna such as 16s rrna copies can represent the number of ribosomes and cellular activity in the lifecycle of bacteria cell the cellular dna content is highly stable most of time lengeler et al 1999 thus the number of cells can be characterized by dna copies such as 16s rrna gene besides the specific activity of cell can be characterized by the ratio of 16s rrna copies to 16s rrna gene copies in theory in the functional decline phase some anaob died with the disintegration of cells and 16s rrna gene copies of anaob decreased the rest anaob survived with the reduced structure redundancy and the 16s rrna copies of anaob decreased the anaob demonstrated a specific ratio of 16s rrna copies to 16s rrna gene copies in the functional stabilization phase the number of anaob became stable and the 16s rrna gene copies of anaob also tended to be stable indicating the survival anaob entered the dormancy state the 16s rrna copies of anaob first decreased to minimal and then tended to be stable anaob displayed a low but stable ratio of 16s rrna copies to 16s rrna gene copies the anammox metabolic pathway of anaob is mainly composed of nitrite reductase nir hydrazine synthase hzs and hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh among them hzs is the rate limiting enzyme kartal et al 2011 therefore the hzs gene abundance and its expression level can indicate the number of anaob cells and their metabolic activity ali et al 2014 overall the hzs gene copies the hzs mrna copies and the ratio of hzs mrna copies to hzs gene copies can confirm the results of 16s rrna gene of anaob even more direct in this study the nrr of anammox system was 4 92 kg n m3 d under normal condition in the functional decline phase the nrr dropped to 8 45 10 3 kg n m3 d fig 2 at the same time the biomass of angs and the eps content decreased figs 3 and 5b accompanying the disintegration of angs with the descending proportion of large fraction and the ascending proportion of small fraction fig 5a the relative abundance of candidatus brocadia and candidatus jettenia dropped sharply while that of candidatus kuenenia climbed slightly fig 6b in the functional stabilization phase the corresponding indicators tended to be stable to our delight the 16s rrna gene copies of anaob hzs gene copies and their transcription level stayed at a constant during this phase indicating the stable state for both the number and activity of anaob the transcription level of 16s rrna gene of anaob and hzs gene dropped to 1 2 and 1 0 of the initial value respectively fig 8 besides the ratio of gene expression level to gene copies was low indicating the low activity state of anaob cells these traits were consistent with the characteristics of dormant anaob in other words the long term substrate starvation indeed made anaob enter the dormancy state living but low activity 4 3 implications of this work the results of this study showed that over the substrate starvation the performance of fanir system took on a unique decay pattern it declined first and then approached a constant level the low but stable activity could serve as the activity index to indicate the dormancy state of anaob with the decay pattern and activity index the dormancy state can be predicted and the corresponding measure can be taken to prevent the poor anammox performance moreover the decay pattern of angs also provides a new enlightenment for the development of advanced anammox nitrogen removal aanr process based on the decay pattern an aanr system can be firstly established in the feast state and then put into work in the famine state by the cycle between the feast and famine conditions the sustainability of aanr system is realized in which some anaob are in the working state and the other anaob are in the rejuvenation state 5 conclusion 5 1 a long term starvation caused the drop but not collapse of working performance for fanir system in the functional decline phase the nrr of fanir system dropped from 16 6 10 3 kg n m3 d to 8 45 10 3 kg n m3 d while in the following functional stabilization phase the nrr stayed at 7 97 2 10 10 3 kg n m3 d 5 2 a long term starvation caused the large decline of anammox capacity to a new but stable level for angs in the functional decline phase the saa of angs fell sharply accompanying the deterioration of other features while in the following functional stabilization phase the saa and accompanying features came to a stable level 5 3 a long term starvation caused the great change of microbial community and metabolic activity in angs in the functional decline phase the relative abundance of anaob declined markedly while in the following functional stabilization phase tended to be constant and the dominant population of anaob shifted from candidatus brocadia to candidatus kuenenia over the entire starvation 5 4 dormancy was found responsible for the deterioration but retention of anammox activity over the long term starvation in the functional decline phase both the number and activity of anaob decreased largely while in the following functional stabilization phase the number and activity became constant showing the typical features of dormant anaob living but low activity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

successfully applied in the nitrogen removal from high strength wastewaters however little information is available for its treatment of low strength wastewaters in this study a famine anammox nitrogen removal fanir system was developed to investigate the effect of long term substrate starvation at the low nitrogen concentration the influent total nitrogen was set at 1 mg l the results showed that the response of fanir system to the starvation stress took on two phases the functional decline phase 0 54 day and the functional stabilization phase 62 116 day over the two phases the nitrogen removal rate nrr of anammox reactor firstly dropped sharply and then came to a constant level the activity and settleability of anammox granular sludge angs firstly deteriorated seriously and then stayed in a stable range the relative abundance of anaerobic ammonium oxidation bacteria anaob firstly decreased markedly and then approached a steady state with the change of dominant genus from candidatus brocadia to candidatus kuenenia the abundance of 16s rrna gene and hzs gene of anaob and their transcription level firstly declined largely as well and then became stable with the 16s rrna gene hzs gene 16s rrna and hzs mrna of anaob at 23 9 9 1 1 2 and 1 0 of the initial value respectively to our delight the behavior of fanir system in the functional stabilization phase was proved indeed consistent with the feature for anaob to enter the dormancy state these findings are helpful to understand the physiology of anaob over the starvation stress and to promote the extension of anammox process to the treatment of low strength wastewaters graphical abstract image 1 keywords famine anammox nitrogen removal system anammox granular sludge anaerobic ammonium oxidation bacteria starvation stress bacterial dormancy 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox is a biological reaction with ammonium as electron donor and nitrite as electron acceptor kuenen 2008 jetten et al 2005 and the nitrogen removal process based on this reaction is called anammox process compared with traditional nitrification denitrification process anammox process has the advantages of no requirement for the external electron donor high nitrogen loading rate and low operation cost it was favored in the field of environmental engineering once it came out fux and siegrist 2004 nowadays around 200 facilities have been put into operation all over the world showing the broad prospects for the biotechnological development cao et al 2017 anaerobic ammonium oxidation bacteria anaob are the functional source of anammox process jin et al 2012 in the anammox granular sludge angs bed system anaob and its associated bacteria mainly exist in the form of granular sludge tang et al 2010 and anaob could be effectively retained in the reaction system due to the good settleability of angs thus endowing the reaction system with the high rate nitrogen removal capacity lu et al 2012 it s reported that the highest nitrogen removal rate nrr could reach 70 0 kg n m3 d in the lab scale reactor tang et al 2011 nowadays angs biotechnology has been widely applied in the treatment of high strength nitrogen wastewaters lackner et al 2014 and the treatment of mainstream wastewater has also become a research hotspot which attained great attention cao et al 2016 besides it has been reported that eutrophication occurs once the total nitrogen exceeds 0 8 mg l xu et al 2014 even though the nitrogen concentration meets the discharge standard of municipal wastewaters its risk to cause the eutrophication of waterbodies still remains so the advanced anammox nitrogen removal aanr process has been proposed recently which focuses on the effluent refining to further reduce ecological risks li et al 2019 however some great challenges have to be faced for the development of angs biotechnology in this field in which the starvation stress of low substrate concentration on anaob is an urgent issue anaob are the basic function unit of angs the anaob community immobilized in angs determines the performance of angs and the capacity of angs bed system previous studies showed that the starvation stress could exert a serious influence on the anammox activity of anaob culture even leading to the loss of anammox activity ma et al 2017 li et al 2019 besides it could also cause the disintegration of angs and the washout of anaob resulting in the instability or collapse of anammox system ali et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 however most of previous studies were carried out in the batch experiments which are different from the commonly used continuous flow systems wang et al 2018 and little is known about the influence of starvation stress on the performance of continuous flow anammox system therefore it is necessary to investigate on the response of continuous flow anammox system to long term starvation for the extension of anammox system to the treatment of low strength wastewaters in addition it s worth noting that anaob widely existed in the oligotrophic habitats where the substrate is often in short supply and anaob must manage the starvation kartal et al 2013 oshiki et al 2016 and zhu et al 2019 found that anaob could survive several years under the natural starvation condition besides wang et al 2016 have successfully recovered the anammox culture starved for 6 months indicating that anaob have the potential to survive in the starvation condition zhu et al 2019 in 1982 xu et al 1982 first reported that e coli and vibrio cholerae could enter the dormacy state when stressed by adverse conditions it has been demonstrated that dormant bacteria stop the growth and reproduction exhibit the low metabolic activity but survive a long time hoehler and jørgensen 2013 zhu et al 2015 the dormant bacteria can resuscitate once the environmental conditions become favorable zhu et al 2019 among the adverse conditions the starvation stress has been recognized as the commonest dormancy inducing condition trevors 2011 therefore it s speculated that the starvation stress of low substrate concentration could induce anaob into the dormancy state showing a low anammox activity up to now however little information can be found about the relationship between starvation stress anaob dormancy and the performance of anammox system in this study a famine anammox nitrogen removal fanir system was developed from a continuous flow angs bed reactor that had worked at the steady state for over 1 year the fanir system was operated under the starvation condition to investigate the effect of long term 120 days substrate starvation mainly including 1 the performance of fanir system at the low substrate concentration 2 the change of angs over the substrate starvation 3 the succession of microbial community in angs 4 the variation of cell number and metabolic activity of anaob the objective of this study was to reveal the response of fanir system to the long term substrate starvation and to provide some information for the extension of anammox process to the treatment of low strength wastewaters 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor

velocity dropped from 82 1 9 6 m h to 32 0 6 3 m h which was 39 0 of the initial value during 94 110 day the settling velocity became stable at 24 7 4 1 m h 30 1 of the initial value 3 2 2 physicochemical properties of angs the function of angs is closely related to its physicochemical properties xu et al 2019a in order to further understand the effect of long term starvation on the function of angs the physicochemical properties of angs were also determined particle size distribution particle size is an important physical property of angs which is related to the mass transfer and settling velocity of angs zhu et al 2018 using qicpic dynamic image analysis system the particle size distribution and volume surface mean diameter vmd were measured over the entire starvation period shown in fig 5 a based on particle size angs could be divided into 5 groups 200 μm i 200 500 μm ii 500 1000 μm iii 1000 2000 μm iv and 2000 μm v during 0 45 day group iv and v accounted for the top proportion 80 during 54 116 day group iii and iv accounted for the top proportion 70 and the proportion of group i and ii increased indicating that starvation led to the disaggregation of angs beyond our expectation the size distribution of angs was relatively stable during 80 116 day the average particle size of angs was characterized by the volume surface mean diameter vmd xu et al 2019a during 0 72 day the vmd of angs decreased from 2065 0 μm to 1271 3 μm which was 61 6 of the initial value during 80 116 day the vmd of angs stayed constantly at 895 7 μm 43 4 of the initial value fig 5a observed under the stereoscope angs was irregular with uneven surface the structure of angs was dense and compact at the beginning of starvation while the morphology of angs became spherical or ellipsoidal with loose structure after the long term starvation fig 4 eps content eps is a vital component of angs mainly composed of proteins pn and polysaccharides ps tang et al 2011 as a binder between cells it is related to the formation and maintenance of angs and as a nutrient it is related to the nitrogen removal capacity serving as electron donor for denitrification and the survival of functional bacteria in angs serving as energy source hou et al 2015 jia et al 2017 the variation of pn and ps two macro components of eps over the long term substrate starvation was shown in fig 5b overall the eps content demonstrated a descending trend indicating that starvation stress led to the eps consumption the consumption of pn was more than that of ps resulting in the large decrease of pn ps during 80 110 day the eps content became relatively constant with a final value of 37 1 of the initial the correlation analysis indicated that the vmd of angs had a significantly positive correlation with the eps content r 0 91 p 0 05 the lower the eps content the smaller the vmd fig 5c on one hand this result confirmed the bonding function of eps in the formation and maintenance of angs on the other hand it also confirmed the disintegration effect of angs after the eps was consumed over the substrate starvation the large fraction decreased while the small fraction increased 3 3 microbial community the 16s rrna gene high throughput sequencing was used to analysis the evolution of microbial community over the long term starvation at the phylum level the main microbial phyla were planctomycetes chloroflexi proteobacteria and bacteroidetes which accounted for more than 80 fig 6 a the relative abundance of planctomycetes which contained anaob decreased sharply over the entire starvation period during 0 62 day the relative abundance decreased from 49 9 to 15 6 during 80 110 day it stabilized at 9 1 1 6 chloroflexi is commonly observed in the autotrophic nitrogen removal system and it is supposed to be able to degrade dissolved organic matters extracellular polymer and dead biomass kindaichi et al 2012 lawson et al 2017 the relative abundance of chloroflexi increased obviously and finally stabilized at 33 5 2 8 which possibly received the support of cellular matters from the lysis of anaob at the genus level fig 6b as anaob candidatus brocadia candidatus kuenenia candidatus jettenia and brocadiaceae unclassified were detected during the entire starvation period the relative abundance of anaob genus demonstrated a descending trend but it became stable during 80 110 days with the total proportion of anaob at 5 4 0 8 the dominant population changed from candidatus brocadia supposed to be eutrophic to candidatus kuenenia supposed to be oligotrophic the species diversity indices indicated that the microbial community diversity of angs increased over the long term starvation table s4 3 4 anaerobic ammonium oxidation bacteria 3 4 1 morphology of anaob anaob have a unique cell compartment structure which is divided into three parts paryphoplasm riboplasm and anammoxosome the intact cellular structure is necessary for anaob to maintain metabolic function van niftrik et al 2008 sem and tem were applied to observe the morphology of anaob over the starvation stress before the starvation the anaob cells were full of the angs the individual cell was large the cell surface was covered by the large amount of eps the cell wall was slightly invaginated like a shallow crater the clear compartments were observed inside the cell the glycogen particles were seen in the riboplasm fig 7 a a xu et al 2019b during the functional decline phase the number of anaob cells decreased in the angs the individual cell shrank in size the amount of eps declined on the cellular surface some deep crater like structures were observed on the cell wall some flexures of cell membrane disappeared the cellular compartments became vague the number of glycogen particles decreased in the riboplasm while that of anammoxosome increased in the cytoplasm fig 7b at the same time many anaob cells died and disintegrated fig s3 during the functional stabilization phase the number of survival anaob cells remained relatively stable in the angs the individual cell became constant in size the eps around the cell almost disappeared deep crater like structures were observed on the cell wall some flexures of cell membrane disappeared the cellular compartments became vague no glycogen particles were observed the anammoxosome deformed severely with a volume accounted for over 90 of cell fig 7b c d in general the morphology of anaob cells tended to be stable during this phase it is worth noting that some black particles with a diameter of about 100 nm appeared inside the anammoxosome fig 7c d which was speculated to have something to do with the starvation stress 3 4 2 number and metabolic activity of anaob the abundance of 16s rrna gene and hzs gene and their transcription level were determined to characterize the number and metabolic activity of anaob over the entire starvation period as shown in fig 8 a during 0 54 days the 16s rrna gene copies of anaob declined from 4 13 0 34 1011 copies g vss to 1 85 0 10 1011 copies g vss which was 44 8 of the initial value during 62 116 days however the 16s rrna gene copies became constant with the final value of 9 87 0 60 1010 copies g vss which was 23 9 of the initial value f fcritical table 1 correspondingly during 0 54 days the 16s rrna copies of anaob dropped from 1 14 0 10 1013 copies g vss to 7 31 2 00 1011 copies g vss 6 4 of the initial value during 62 116 days the 16s rrna copies became stable with the final value of 1 32 0 13 1011 copies g vss 1 2 of the initial value f fcritical table 1 it is worth noting that during 62 116 days the ratio of 16s rrna copies to 16s rrna gene copies of anaob also became stable with the final value of 1 33 0 06 which was 5 4 of the initial value f fcritical table 1 as shown in fig 8b the change of hzs gene copies and its transcription level was consistent with that of 16s rrna gene during 0 54 days the hzs gene copies decreased from 1 01 0 21 1012 copies g vss to 2 77 0 06 1011 copies g vss 27 4 of the initial value during 62 116 days the hzs gene became constant with the final value of 9 22 0 29 1010 copies g vss 9 1 of the initial value f fcritical table 1 at the same time 0 54 days the hzs mrna copies dropped from 5 87 0 25 1011 copies g vss to 2 72 0 11 1010 copies g vss 4 6 of the initial value during 62 116 days the hzs mrna copies became stable with the final value of 6 02 0 52 109 copies g vss 1 0 of the initial value f fcritical table 1 to our delight during the 62 116 days the ratio of hzs gene copies to hzs mrna was also stable with the final value of 5 32 0 46 10 2 8 9 of the initial value f fcritical table 1 4 discussion a fanir system was established from a lab scale angs bed reactor that had worked at the steady state for over 1 year the fanir system was operated with the continuous flow for about 120 days in this experiment and the influent total nitrogen concentration was set around 1 mg l which approached the low concentration limit xu et al 2014 li et al 2019 the response of fanir system to the low substrate concentration can help to understand the physiology of anaob over the starvation stress and to provide some important information for the development of anammox process to treat low strength wastewaters 4 1 response of fanir system to substrate starvation after the influent ammonium and nitrite decreased from the normal level 150 12 mg l and 167 17 mg l to the low level 0 5 mg l and 0 5 mg l the nrr of fanir system fell to the low value 16 6 10 3 kg n m3 d and then stayed at the low level which matched with the nlr however the substrate starvation could give rise to the disintegration of angs and the washout of anaob leading to the further decline of nrr fig 2 this was consistent with the results reported in previous literatures wu et al 2015 li et al 2019 anaob are the functional source of fanir system anaob form angs by themselves with the aid of eps angs endowed its microbial community with the activity and settleability supporting the performance of fanir system tang et al 2017 to sustain the life anaob require the maintenance energy under the starvation condition the substrate could not provide anaob with enough maintenance energy ma et al 2017 anaob had to consume eps as energy source causing the disintegration of angs and the dispersal of microbial community wang et al 2013 chen and jin 2017 to our surprise the nrr of fanir system stayed at a low level but did not disappeared over the 2 month starvation fig 2 4 2 the dormancy state of anaerobic ammonium oxidation bacteria the metabolic process of anaob included anabolism and catabolism when anabolism exceeded catabolism anaob grew conversely anaob decayed oshiki et al 2016 li et al 2019 biological loading rate blr the ratio of substrate supply velocity to biomass played a key role in regulating the balance between anabolism and catabolism thus affecting the growth and decay of anaob cells the functional bacteria exhibited a phenotype at a blr and based on this the up regulation of blr would enhance the phenotype of functional bacteria while the down regulation of blr would weaken the phenotype rittmann and mccarty 2012 kang et al 2019b over the substrate starvation at a low blr the functional bacteria cells did not grow well with a small size light weight simplified structure and weakened metabolism hoehler and jørgensen 2013 when the starvation stress was intensified the functional bacteria cells would decompose the redundant cellular components to provide nutrients especially energy kartal et al 2013 when the energy available exhausted the functional bacteria cells entered the dormancy state which stopped growth and proliferation but retained the low activity wang et al 2016 zhu et al 2019 enzymes are catalysts of cellular metabolism and regulators of biological process lodish et al 2008 since ribosome is the molecular machine of enzyme synthesis so enzyme synthesis is largely dependent on the number of ribosomes generally the more the number of ribosomes the higher the cellular activity lengeler et al 1999 therefore the metabolic activity of cell can be characterized by the number of ribosomes rrna is the main component of ribosomes which accounts for more than 60 of the ribosomes mass simonović and steitz 2009 so rrna such as 16s rrna copies can represent the number of ribosomes and cellular activity in the lifecycle of bacteria cell the cellular dna content is highly stable most of time lengeler et al 1999 thus the number of cells can be characterized by dna copies such as 16s rrna gene besides the specific activity of cell can be characterized by the ratio of 16s rrna copies to 16s rrna gene copies in theory in the functional decline phase some anaob died with the disintegration of cells and 16s rrna gene copies of anaob decreased the rest anaob survived with the reduced structure redundancy and the 16s rrna copies of anaob decreased the anaob demonstrated a specific ratio of 16s rrna copies to 16s rrna gene copies in the functional stabilization phase the number of anaob became stable and the 16s rrna gene copies of anaob also tended to be stable indicating the survival anaob entered the dormancy state the 16s rrna copies of anaob first decreased to minimal and then tended to be stable anaob displayed a low but stable ratio of 16s rrna copies to 16s rrna gene copies the anammox metabolic pathway of anaob is mainly composed of nitrite reductase nir hydrazine synthase hzs and hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh among them hzs is the rate limiting enzyme kartal et al 2011 therefore the hzs gene abundance and its expression level can indicate the number of anaob cells and their metabolic activity ali et al 2014 overall the hzs gene copies the hzs mrna copies and the ratio of hzs mrna copies to hzs gene copies can confirm the results of 16s rrna gene of anaob even more direct in this study the nrr of anammox system was 4 92 kg n m3 d under normal condition in the functional decline phase the nrr dropped to 8 45 10 3 kg n m3 d fig 2 at the same time the biomass of angs and the eps content decreased figs 3 and 5b accompanying the disintegration of angs with the descending proportion of large fraction and the ascending proportion of small fraction fig 5a the relative abundance of candidatus brocadia and candidatus jettenia dropped sharply while that of candidatus kuenenia climbed slightly fig 6b in the functional stabilization phase the corresponding indicators tended to be stable to our delight the 16s rrna gene copies of anaob hzs gene copies and their transcription level stayed at a constant during this phase indicating the stable state for both the number and activity of anaob the transcription level of 16s rrna gene of anaob and hzs gene dropped to 1 2 and 1 0 of the initial value respectively fig 8 besides the ratio of gene expression level to gene copies was low indicating the low activity state of anaob cells these traits were consistent with the characteristics of dormant anaob in other words the long term substrate starvation indeed made anaob enter the dormancy state living but low activity 4 3 implications of this work the results of this study showed that over the substrate starvation the performance of fanir system took on a unique decay pattern it declined first and then approached a constant level the low but stable activity could serve as the activity index to indicate the dormancy state of anaob with the decay pattern and activity index the dormancy state can be predicted and the corresponding measure can be taken to prevent the poor anammox performance moreover the decay pattern of angs also provides a new enlightenment for the development of advanced anammox nitrogen removal aanr process based on the decay pattern an aanr system can be firstly established in the feast state and then put into work in the famine state by the cycle between the feast and famine conditions the sustainability of aanr system is realized in which some anaob are in the working state and the other anaob are in the rejuvenation state 5 conclusion 5 1 a long term starvation caused the drop but not collapse of working performance for fanir system in the functional decline phase the nrr of fanir system dropped from 16 6 10 3 kg n m3 d to 8 45 10 3 kg n m3 d while in the following functional stabilization phase the nrr stayed at 7 97 2 10 10 3 kg n m3 d 5 2 a long term starvation caused the large decline of anammox capacity to a new but stable level for angs in the functional decline phase the saa of angs fell sharply accompanying the deterioration of other features while in the following functional stabilization phase the saa and accompanying features came to a stable level 5 3 a long term starvation caused the great change of microbial community and metabolic activity in angs in the functional decline phase the relative abundance of anaob declined markedly while in the following functional stabilization phase tended to be constant and the dominant population of anaob shifted from candidatus brocadia to candidatus kuenenia over the entire starvation 5 4 dormancy was found responsible for the deterioration but retention of anammox activity over the long term starvation in the functional decline phase both the number and activity of anaob decreased largely while in the following functional stabilization phase the number and activity became constant showing the typical features of dormant anaob living but low activity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to
