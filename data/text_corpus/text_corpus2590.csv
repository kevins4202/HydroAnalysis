oxide fe3o4 nps on organic matter removal methanogenesis microbial communities and metabolic pathways in the anaerobic biofilm system for treating domestic wastewater at ambient temperature were studied the results showed nzvi and fe3o4 nps not only promoted the hydrolytic fermentation process of the anaerobic biofilm system but also facilitated the removal of refractory organic matter especially fe3o4 nps improved the methanogenic efficiency shortened the lag time and entered the rapid methanogenic stage rapidly fe3o4 nps formed direct interspecies electron transfer diet and symbiotic relationship between the acetic acid oxidizing bacteria and the methanogenic bacteria furthermore fe3o4 nps promoted the biosynthesis of f420 in the fe3o4 nps system the co2 reduced methanogenesis as the main methanogenic pathway was enhanced graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords domestic wastewater anaerobic methanogenesis fe3o4 nps metabolic pathways diet 1 introduction nowadays the amount of municipal wastewater in the worldwide is astronomically huge which needs to consume a lot of removal organic matter achieving anaerobic treatment from municipal wastewater not only can energy consumption and sludge production be reduced but also clean energy methane ch4 can be produced recent researches about anaerobic methane production from domestic wastewater were focused on up flow anaerobic sludge bed reactors uasb anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbr and anaerobic filter af however it was found that anaerobic treatment of domestic wastewater was not efficient methane production due to low organic matter concentrations low temperatures etc therefore it is so significant to enhance the methanogenic capacity of municipal wastewater for practical application of anaerobic treatment processes some conductive materials such as nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi nano ferroferric oxide fe3o4 nps and ferroferric oxide fe3o4 were proved to strengthen the methanogenic process during anaerobic biological treatment these studies on enhancing the anaerobic process by dosing the external medium focused on the anaerobic digestion of sludge 2 21 32 the anaerobic digestion of food wastes 28 and the anaerobic treatment of high organic matter wastewater 19 22 25 34 35 the addition of conductive materials in anaerobic sludge digestion and anaerobic wastewater treatment systems not only promoted the hydrolytic acidification process but also changed the structure of the microbial communities 11 19 22 during anaerobic biological treatment process it is important to keep the collaboration and balance between bacteria and archaea and the efficient electron transfer the most common electronic transfers are interspecies hydrogen transfer iht 16 and interspecies formate transfer iet 4 since hydrogen h2 is a direct electron acceptor in iht the partial pressure of h2 influenced iht 5 recently direct interspecies electron transfer diet 17 was found in co culture systems formed by syntrophic microorganisms and methanogenic archaea which was considered as a more efficient mechanism than others through enhancing diet some conductive materials such as nzvi 18 fe3o4 nps 31 and fe3o4 26 were proved to strengthen the methanogenic process during anaerobic wastewater treatment furthermore methanosaeta can produce ch4 via diet 19 22 26 34 35 to date no studies have been carried out on the effects of external mediums on the enhancement of anaerobic methanogenesis the changes of microbial communities and the analysis of metabolic pathways for treating domestic wastewater therefore in this study nzvi and fe3o4 nps were applied in anaerobic filter to enhance the anaerobic treatment of domestic wastewater at ambient temperatures the aims of this study were to 1 determine whether the addition of nzvi and fe3o4 nps can promote organic matter removal and methane production 2 analyze the effects of nzvi and fe3o4 nps on the structure of microorganisms 3 further analyze the effect of fe3o4 nps on metabolic functions and methanogenic metabolic pathways of anaerobic microorganisms 2 material and methods 2 1 characteristics of domestic sewage and seeding sludge the raw domestic sewage used in this study was taken from a septic tank in the residential area of beijing university of technology beijing china total chemical oxygen demand tcod soluble chemical oxygen demand scod nh4 n no2 n and no3 n in the domestic wastewater were 98 5 280 3 mg l 90 5 180 0 mg l 34 6 87 6 mg l 0 0 6 mg l and 0 3 1 8 mg l respectively a pilot scale af for treating municipal wastewater operated for 2 years were located at a municipal wastewater treatment plant in beijing china the filter media was taken from the pilot scale af and then the biofilm detached from the filter media by shaking was used as seeding sludge in this study 2 2 experimental setup and operation a 250 ml serum bottle with a working volume of 200 ml was used as an anaerobic batch reactor the reaction cycle included feeding anaerobic reacting settling and withdrawal at the feeding stage 150 ml wastewater and 50 ml seeding sludge were firstly added into these reactors after mixing 0 2 g nzvi and 0 04 g fe3o4 nps were added to nzvi reactor rz and fe3o4 nps reactor rf respectively whereas the control reactor rc was not added any additional substances after the feeding stage nitrogen gas was flushed at headspace for about 5 min to remove oxygen and then each reactor was sealed and kept in a water bath shaker with the rotation of 150 r min and the stable temperature of 25 c the anaerobic reacting time and settling time were determined by cod removal rate and the height of sludge bed respectively the gas from the headspace of the bottle and liquid sample was collected for analysis by 5 ml injectors after collecting samples nitrogen gas n2 was used to keep anaerobic conditions nzvi and fe3o4 nps were added to rz and rf reactors again for only two times on the first cycle and fourth cycle respectively the other cycles were normal operations without nzvi and fe3o4 nps addition nzvi diameter of 50 nm purity 99 9 and fe3o4 nps diameter of 20 nm purity 99 5 were purchased from macklin shanghai china 2 3 analytical methods all samples were centrifuged at 4000 r min for 10 min before analysis scod was filtered using a 0 45 um syringe filter

using a gc agilent 7890a usa with a flame ionization detector fid and j whp plotq 30 m 40 μm 0 53 mm column the temperatures of injector detector and column were kept at 225 c 225 c and 80 c respectively nitrogen was supplied as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 25 ml min the total ch4 production consisted of the ch4 production in the emitted gas the gaseous ch4 and the ch4 dissolved in the mixture the dissolved ch4 the gaseous ch4 was directly taken from the top space of reactors at each sampling point and then measured directly by gc the volume of the mixture was not enough to multi analyze the dissolved ch4 in addition since the dissolved ch4 was almost converted to the gasous ch4 no dissolved ch4 was detected during the pre experiment therefore the dissolved ch4 was measured at the end of the reaction to check the produced ch4 dissolved in the mixture or not moreover the modified gompertz model was used to stimulate the cumulative methane p the headspace method was used to analyze the dissolved ch4 in this method a 25 ml anaerobic headspace bottle was filled with 20 ml of the filtered mixture and 5 ml of nitrogen gas after standing the bottle in a water bath at 25 c for 1 h and shaking it at 225 rpm and 25 c for 30 min gas sample in the headspace was collected to measure ch4 concentration by gc the dissolved ch4 and the ch4 yield were calculated by eqs 1

www kegg jp 3 results and discussion 3 1 enhancement of nzvi and fe3o4 nps on organic matter removal in anaerobic process fig 1 a showed variations of tcod and scod in rc rz and rf on the first cycle with addition of nzvi and fe3o4 nps 0 1 5 h tcod was slightly removed while scod was slightly increased in rc rz and rf compared to rc and rz scod in rf was obviously increased it indicated that complex compounds were degraded to low molecular compounds at first of anaerobic reaction obviously in this phase fe3o4 nps can significantly promote hydrolysis and acidification 1 5 8 0 h tcod and scod notably decreased in rc rz and rf since nzvi as a reducing agent promoted the breaking of unsaturated bonds of macromolecular organic matters 29 which were easily further converted into carbon gases among these anaerobic reactors tcod and scod removal rates were the fastest in rz in which tcod and scod removal rates were 61 and 72 respectively more importantly scod in the effluent of rz was only 28 79 mg l compared with rc tcod removal rate in rf increased by 36 while scod removal rate only increased by 5 it was likely that complex organics were mainly oxidized to simple organics during the dissimilated iron reduction process of fe3 32 8 10 h tcod and scod in the three systems remained unchanged which showed that the anaerobic reaction basically stopped due to low substrates concentration the above results indicated that nzvi and fe3o4 nps notably promoted organics removal especially nzvi were more enhanced organics converted to carbon gases whereas fe3o4 nps were only more beneficial to promote hydrolysis and acidification previous studies found that both nzvi and fe3o4 nps enhanced the hydrolysis and acidification process in the anaerobic digestion system of sludge 30 moreover the effect of nzvi on hydrolysis and acidification was better than that of fe3o4 nps fig 1 b showed variations of tcod and scod in anaerobic biosystems of rc rz and rf on the ninth cycle after the addition of nzvi and fe3o4 nps although nzvi and fe3o4 nps enhanced cod removal when adding nzvi and fe3o4 nps the enhancement ability of cod removal did not last a long time on ninth cycle tcod and scod removal rates were 58 and 63 in rc respectively although scod removal rate was basically the same as that in rc tcod removal rate in rz was slightly reduced to 50 however tcod and scod removal rates of rf decreased by 23 although nzvi and fe3o4 nps can absorb on the surface of sludge and affect the microbial metabolism the duration of its enhanced organic matter removal ability was short 2 fig 2 showed variations of vfas and scod in rc rz and rf on the ninth cycle after those systems were restored to normal operation in rf acetate concentration was higher than the other two reactors at first 36 h but the degradation rate of acetate was slower than others moreover in rz and rc about 95 of acetate was degraded at 72 h and 60 h respectively moreover acetate concentration was lower than 2 mg l it was indicated that fe3o4 nps may inhibit acetoclastic methanogenesis leading to the decrease of acetate utilization rate the mechanism of fe3o4 nps inhibition needed further analysis of microbial communities in rf 3 2 fe3o4 nps significantly facilitate methane production anaerobic microbes can gradually convert organic matter to ch4 or co2 through the hydrolysis acidification and methanogenic processes after adding nzvi and fe3o4 nps at the first reaction cycle the methane yield of rz rf and rc were 0 15 0 07 and 0 09 lch4 gtcodre respectively compared with rc the methane yield of rz was increased by 66 7 whereas the methane yield of rf was decreased by 22 2 it was probably due to h2 generated by nzvi corrosion at the initial stage of dosing provided a substrate for methanogens meanwhile nzvi reduced orp and provided a suitable environment for methanogens however in the presence of fe3o4 nps the dissimilated iron reduction process of fe3o4 nps competed for electrons with the reduction of ch4 by ch3 s com 32 which resulted in the decrease of ch4 production in rf therefore at the initial stage of dosing fe3o4 nps although fe3o4 nps promoted the hydrolysis and acidification process it inhibited the methanogenic process fig 3 showed the total cumulative ch4 and fitting performance of modified gompertz model in rc rz and rf on the ninth cycle when those systems returned to the stable operation period in rf the total cumulative ch4 in the whole reaction was 5 41 ml whereas the total cumulative ch4 in rc and rz were only 1 66 ml and 1 71 ml respectively the amount of cumulative ch4 in rf was 3 27 times than that of rc compared with rc the methane yield of rf with 0 179 lch4 gtcodre was improved by 258 however the acetate degradation ability of rf was notably decreased fig 2 these results indicated that fe3o4 nps likely promoted co2 reducing methanogenesis which did not agree with previous studies some studies found that fe3o4 nps promoted the activity of acetoclastic methanogens 19 22 25 27 34 35 since variation existed in the seeding sludge of rc rz and rf the modified gompertz model was used to analyze the promotion of nzvi and fe3o4 nps to the methanogenic capability the total cumulative ch4 curve of rc rz and rf were all well fitted by the modified gompertz model with r2 of 0 99875 0 99338 and 0 98137 respectively the obtained pmax rmax and λ were used to measure the methane accumulation gas production rate and the times required to get into the rapid methanogenesis during anaerobic treatment respectively the promotion of adding substances for methanogenesis in different types of reaction substances was summarized in table 1 λ of rz was shortened by 19 6 whereas λ of rf was shortened by 196 7 which indicated that the anaerobic reaction in rf very easily entered the rapid methane production phase at the initial of the reaction compared with rc rmax of rz was decreased by 28 6 the intensity of humic acid like in tb eps in rz reached 275 8 while in rc it was only 168 2 fig s1 humic acid like substances may be derived from the biodegradation of microorganisms after death therefore nzvi not further promoted the methanogenic process in the previous researches nzvi and fe3o4 nps enhanced both pmax and rmax yet there was a diffident effect on λ 19 22 25 28 33 in the anaerobic system fe3o4 nps as the electronic conductor transferred electrons directly to methanogenic archaea for methanogenesis which facilitated the diet process 11 enhanced the efficiency of methane production and shorten the methanogenic lag time of anaerobic system causing the system with the addition of fe3o4 nps to rapidly enter the rapid methanogenic phase 3 3 effect of nzvi and fe3o4 nps on microbial community structure fig 4 a showed the relative abundance of bacterial communities at the family level in rc rz and rf rhodocylaceae bacteroidetes vadinha17 and lentimicrobiaceae were dominated in rc rz and rf rhodocylaceae and bacteroidetes vadinha17 were the key groups in the hydrolysis process rhodocylaceae the key bacteria in hydrolysis and acidification was capable to degrade aromatic compounds 12 the relative abundance of rhodocylaceae increased by 103 in the rz while in rf its relative abundance decreased by 42 bacteroidetes vadinha17 was common hydrolytic fermentation bacteria in anaerobic system which converted refractory organics to short chain fatty acid 15 21 the relative abundance of bacteroidetes vadinha17 also increased because of the addition of nzvi and fe3o4 nps latescibacterota was reported to degrade complex organic compounds under anaerobic conditions 6 in the presence of fe3o4 nps the relative abundance of latescibacterota increased to 4 63 nzvi and fe3o4 nps caused the changes of bacteria communities especially the dominant hydrolytic fermentation bacteria the dominant hydrolytic fermentation bacteria in rc and rz were rhodocylaceae whereas in rf it was bacteroidetes vadinha17 and latescibacterota the bacteria degraded refractory organics were significantly enriched in rz and rf resulting in nzvi and fe3o4 nps promoted the hydrolysis and acidification process and enhanced tcod removal after depth analysis of the bacteria at the genus level the group of syntrophic acetate oxidation bacteria including thauera clostridium sensu stricto and norank f synergistaceae were significantly enriched in rf the relative abundance of thauera clostridium sensu stricto and norank f synergistaceae in rf was 2 1 fold 1 5 fold and 5 3 fold higher than rc respectively fig s2 since thauera 24 clostridium sensu stricto 8 and norank f synergistaceae 10 reduced fe3 and oxidized organic matter and carried out extracellular electron transfer in rf the process of extracellular electron transfer and syntrophic acetate oxidation was likely improved further promoting the electron transfer efficiency of the system and increasing ch4 production the ets activity in rf was 3 15 mg mg h which was 35 higher than that in rc fig 5 the presence of fe3o4 nps increased the ets activity and promoted the electron transfer rate 31 the added fe3o4 nps in this study as magnetic materials was very likely in the system while attached to the microbial surface fe3o4 nps as a medium promoted ets of the dominant the acetic acid oxidizing bacteria including thauera clostridium sensu stricto and norank f synergistaceae and further formed diet between acetic acid oxidizing bacteria and methanogenic archaea the acetic acid oxidizing bacteria produced co2 and then co2 as the substrate was converted to ch4 by methanogenic bacteria the symbiotic relationship between acetic acid oxidizing bacteria and methanogenic bacteria enhanced the efficiency of ch4 production the relative abundance of the archaeal microbial communities showed that methanosaeta was the dominant genus of methanogenic archaea in rc rz and rf accounting for 53 5 58 6 and 65 8 respectively fig 4 b methanosaeta as an acetoclastic methanogen not only had a high affinity for acetic acid but also used the sole substrate acetic acid to produce ch4 methanosaeta was usually found to be dominant methanogens in systems with low acetic acid concentrations 23 moreover methanosaeta in the anaerobic system with the adding magnetic substance could participate in diet and further utilized co2 to produce ch4 34 35 therefore in this study methanosaeta also very likely enhanced the capability of ch4 production 3 4 the metabolic functions of anaerobic microorganisms and methanogenic metabolic pathway to further analyze the changes of microbial metabolic functions picrust2 functional prediction analysis was performed based on high throughput sequencing data the functional components in the three systems were annotated and analyzed by the kegg database the results of methane production bacterial and archaeal community structure and kegg pathway of the three systems showed that the metabolic pathway of rf was fundamentally different from that of rc and rz therefore the methane producing metabolic pathway in rf was deeply analyzed based on the abundance of genes encoding the enzymes involved in the methane metabolism module of the kegg module nsti between 0 03 0 02 and 0 17 0 02 represented the accuracy and reliability of picrust2 prediction 9 nsti of rc rz and rf were 0 11 0 11 and 0 10 respectively proving the reliability of the results 3 4 1 kegg pathway analysis the functional abundance of kegg level 1 2 3 and module in rc rz and rf were shown in fig 6 a at kegg level 1 and 2 relative abundance of all functions were similar in different systems the analysis of energy metabolism at kegg level 3 found the relative abundance of methane metabolism in rc rz and rf were 3 97 4 28 and 4 19 respectively based on the analysis of the kegg module database in the kegg database the relative abundance of the acetic acid methanogenic pathway the co2 reduced methanogenic pathway and the methylotrophic methanogenic pathway were somewhat enriched in rz whereas in rf only two methanogenic pathways the acetic acid methanogenic pathway and the co2 reduced methanogenic pathway were enriched interestingly the relative abundance of the coenzyme f420 biosynthesis pathway in rf was increased the actual measured coenzyme f420 concentration of 0 007 mmol gvss in rf reached 3 5 times than that in rc fig 5 key enzyme activities in methanogenesis were influenced by fe2 concentration in the environment 20 since fe3o4 nps could form fe2 by the reduction process of dissimilatory iron under the simulation of fe3o4 nps not only promoted the biosynthesis of f420 but also the relative abundance of f420 enzyme genes was increased thus the methanogenic process was further enhanced in rf 3 4 2 methaneogenic metabolic pathway in rf to deeply investigate the effect of fe3o4 nps on the methanogenic pathway the genes encoding important enzymes involved in five kegg modules responsible for methanogenic metabolism were detected fig 6 b showed methanogenic metabolic pathway and relative abundance of the genes encoding enzymes in rf the acetic acid methanogenic pathway and the co2 reduced methanogenic pathway were predominant in rf compared with rc formyl methanofuran dehydrogenase ec 1 2 7 12 served as an important enzyme at the initial step of the co2 reduced methanogenic pathway increased by 7 8 in addition coenzyme f420 hydrogenase ec 1 12 98 1 in rf which was responsible for transferring electrons during the reaction was 5 2 more than that in rc fig 6 c showed heatmap of the genes encoding enzymes of rc rz and rf in different methane metabolic module compared with rc the relative abundance of the genes encoding important enzymes involved in the co2 reduced methanogenic pathway was all increased in rf further confirming fe3o4 nps enhanced the co2 reduced methanogenic pathway acetyl coa could be formed through two pathways in the acetic acid methanogenic pathway mainly due to the different metabolic processes of methanosarcina and methanosaeta methanosarcina converted the acetate to acetyl coa with acetate kinase ec 2 7 2 1 and phosphate acetyltransferase ec 2 3 1 8 whereas methanosaeta used acetate coa ligase ec 6 2 1 1 to produce acetyl coa compared with rc the relative abundance of acetate coa ligase was increased by 13 12 in rf however the relative abundance of acetate kinase and phosphate acetyltransferase was decreased by 27 27 and 24 97 respectively this result was in accordance with the above obtained result that the relative abundance of methanosacrina was decreased in rf fig 4 although methanosaeta was enriched in rf further analysis of the acetic acid methanogenic pathway in rf revealed that the abundance of acetyl coa decarbonylase synthase complex ec 2 3 1 169 was decreased by 54 02 compared with rc causing the decreased utilization efficiency of acetate in rf fig 2 however the methanogenic efficiency of rf was not affected by the inhibition of the acetic acid methanogenic process but rather increased therefore it was speculated that the co2 reduced methanogenic pathway was very likely to be the main methanogenic pathway in rf methanosaeta as a specialized acetate methanogenic archaea was the dominant methanogenic archaeon in rf traditionally methanosaeta only used acetate for methanogenesis but it was reported that geobacter could transfer electrons to methanosaeta by diet in geobacter and methanosaeta aggregates which provided the conditions for methanosaeta to use co2 to produce methane 13 meanwhile the acetic acid oxidizing bacteria thauera clostridium sensu stricto and norank f synergistaceae were enriched in rf which carried out extracellular electron transfer more importantly fe3o4 nps as electron transfer carriers provided the conditions for the formation of diet between methanosaeta and acetic acid oxidizing bacteria thus extracellular electrons generated by acetic acid oxidizing bacteria were directly transferred to methanosaeta and then methanosaeta used co2 produced during the acetate oxidation to produce ch4 fig 6 b this process reduced the methanogenic lag time and rapidly entered the rapid methanogenic process which increases the system methane yield and strengthened the system methanogenic capacity this system therefore produced the most methane among the three systems despite the conversion of acetate to ch4 was somewhat inhibited 4 conclusions nzvi and fe3o4 nps not only promoted the hydrolytic fermentation process of the anaerobic biofilm system but also facilitated the removal of refractory organic matter fe3o4 nps improved the methanogenic efficiency shortened the lag time and entered the rapid methanogenic stage rapidly fe3o4 nps as a medium promoted ets of thauera clostridium sensu stricto and norank f synergistaceae and further formed diet and symbiotic relationship between these acetic acid oxidizing bacteria and the methanogenic bacteria furthermore fe3o4 nps not only promoted the biosynthesis of f420 but also the relative abundance of f420 enzyme genes was increased therefore the process of acetoclastic methanogenesis in the fe3o4 nps system was somewhat suppressed but co2 reduced methanogenesis was enhanced resulting in an increase in the

respectively nitrogen was supplied as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 25 ml min the total ch4 production consisted of the ch4 production in the emitted gas the gaseous ch4 and the ch4 dissolved in the mixture the dissolved ch4 the gaseous ch4 was directly taken from the top space of reactors at each sampling point and then measured directly by gc the volume of the mixture was not enough to multi analyze the dissolved ch4 in addition since the dissolved ch4 was almost converted to the gasous ch4 no dissolved ch4 was detected during the pre experiment therefore the dissolved ch4 was measured at the end of the reaction to check the produced ch4 dissolved in the mixture or not moreover the modified gompertz model was used to stimulate the cumulative methane p the headspace method

with addition of nzvi and fe3o4 nps 0 1 5 h tcod was slightly removed while scod was slightly increased in rc rz and rf compared to rc and rz scod in rf was obviously increased it indicated that complex compounds were degraded to low molecular compounds at first of anaerobic reaction obviously in this phase fe3o4 nps can significantly promote hydrolysis and acidification 1 5 8 0 h tcod and scod notably decreased in rc rz and rf since nzvi as a reducing agent promoted the breaking of unsaturated bonds of macromolecular organic matters 29 which were easily further converted into carbon gases among these anaerobic reactors tcod and scod removal rates were the fastest in rz in which tcod and scod removal rates were 61 and 72 respectively more importantly scod in the effluent of rz was only 28 79 mg l compared with rc tcod removal rate in rf increased by 36 while scod removal rate only increased by 5 it was likely that complex organics were mainly oxidized to simple organics during the dissimilated iron reduction process of fe3 32 8 10 h tcod and scod in the three systems remained unchanged which showed that the anaerobic reaction basically stopped due to low substrates concentration the above results indicated that nzvi and fe3o4 nps notably promoted organics removal especially nzvi were more enhanced organics converted to carbon gases whereas fe3o4 nps were only more beneficial to promote hydrolysis and acidification previous studies found that both nzvi and fe3o4 nps enhanced the hydrolysis and acidification process in the anaerobic digestion system of sludge 30 moreover the effect of nzvi on hydrolysis and acidification was better than that of fe3o4 nps fig 1 b showed variations of tcod and scod in anaerobic biosystems of rc rz and rf on the ninth cycle after the addition of nzvi and fe3o4 nps although nzvi and fe3o4 nps enhanced cod removal when adding nzvi and fe3o4 nps the enhancement ability of cod removal did not last a long time on ninth cycle tcod and scod removal rates were 58 and 63 in rc respectively although scod removal rate was basically the same as that in rc tcod removal rate in rz was slightly reduced to 50 however tcod and scod removal rates of rf decreased by 23 although nzvi and fe3o4 nps can absorb on the surface of sludge and affect the microbial metabolism the duration of its enhanced organic matter removal ability was short 2 fig 2 showed variations of vfas and scod in rc rz and rf on the ninth cycle after those systems were restored to normal operation in rf acetate concentration was higher than the other two reactors at first 36 h but the degradation rate of acetate was slower than others moreover in rz and rc about 95 of acetate was degraded at 72 h and 60 h respectively moreover acetate concentration was lower than 2 mg l it was indicated that fe3o4 nps may inhibit acetoclastic methanogenesis leading to the decrease of acetate utilization rate the mechanism of fe3o4 nps inhibition needed further analysis of microbial communities in rf 3 2 fe3o4 nps significantly facilitate methane production anaerobic microbes can gradually convert organic matter to ch4 or co2 through the hydrolysis acidification and methanogenic processes after adding nzvi and fe3o4 nps at the first reaction cycle the methane yield of rz rf and rc were 0 15 0 07 and 0 09 lch4 gtcodre respectively compared with rc the methane yield of rz was increased by 66 7 whereas the methane yield of rf was decreased by 22 2 it was probably due to h2 generated by nzvi corrosion at the initial stage of dosing provided a substrate for methanogens meanwhile nzvi reduced orp and provided a suitable environment for methanogens however in the presence of fe3o4 nps the dissimilated iron reduction process of fe3o4 nps competed for electrons with the reduction of ch4 by ch3 s com 32 which resulted in the decrease of ch4 production in rf therefore at the initial stage of dosing fe3o4 nps although fe3o4 nps promoted the hydrolysis and acidification process it inhibited the methanogenic process fig 3 showed the total cumulative ch4 and fitting performance of modified gompertz model in rc rz and rf on the ninth cycle when those systems returned to the stable operation period in rf the total cumulative ch4 in the whole reaction was 5 41 ml whereas the total cumulative ch4 in rc and rz were only 1 66 ml and 1 71 ml respectively the amount of cumulative ch4 in rf was 3 27 times than that of rc compared with rc the methane yield of rf with 0 179 lch4 gtcodre was improved by 258 however the acetate degradation ability of rf was notably decreased fig 2 these results indicated that fe3o4 nps likely promoted co2 reducing methanogenesis which did not agree with previous studies some studies found that fe3o4 nps promoted the activity of acetoclastic methanogens 19 22 25 27 34 35 since variation existed in the seeding sludge of rc rz and rf the modified gompertz model was used to analyze the promotion of nzvi and fe3o4 nps to the methanogenic capability the total cumulative ch4 curve of rc rz and rf were all well fitted by the modified gompertz model with r2 of 0 99875 0 99338 and 0 98137 respectively the obtained pmax rmax and λ were used to measure the methane accumulation gas production rate and the times required to get into the rapid methanogenesis during anaerobic treatment respectively the promotion of adding substances for methanogenesis in different types of reaction substances was summarized in table 1 λ of rz was shortened by 19 6 whereas λ of rf was shortened by 196 7 which indicated that the anaerobic reaction in rf very easily entered the rapid methane production phase at the initial of the reaction compared with rc rmax of rz was decreased by 28 6 the intensity of humic acid like in tb eps in rz reached 275 8 while in rc it was only 168 2 fig s1 humic acid like substances may be derived from the biodegradation of microorganisms after death therefore nzvi not further promoted the methanogenic process in the previous researches nzvi and fe3o4 nps enhanced both pmax and rmax yet there was a diffident effect on λ 19 22 25 28 33 in the anaerobic system fe3o4 nps as the electronic conductor transferred electrons directly to methanogenic archaea for methanogenesis which facilitated the diet process 11 enhanced the efficiency of methane production and shorten the methanogenic lag time of anaerobic system causing the system with the addition of fe3o4 nps to rapidly enter the rapid methanogenic phase 3 3 effect of nzvi and fe3o4 nps on microbial community structure fig 4 a showed the relative abundance of bacterial communities at the family level in rc rz and rf rhodocylaceae bacteroidetes vadinha17 and lentimicrobiaceae were dominated in rc rz and rf rhodocylaceae and bacteroidetes vadinha17 were the key groups in the hydrolysis process rhodocylaceae the key bacteria in hydrolysis and acidification was capable to degrade aromatic compounds 12 the relative abundance of rhodocylaceae increased by 103 in the rz while in rf its relative abundance decreased by 42 bacteroidetes vadinha17 was common hydrolytic fermentation bacteria in anaerobic system which converted refractory organics to short chain fatty acid 15 21 the relative abundance of bacteroidetes vadinha17 also increased because of the addition of nzvi and fe3o4 nps latescibacterota was reported to degrade complex organic compounds under anaerobic conditions 6 in the presence of fe3o4 nps the relative abundance of latescibacterota increased to 4 63 nzvi and fe3o4 nps caused the changes of bacteria communities especially the dominant hydrolytic fermentation bacteria the dominant hydrolytic fermentation bacteria in rc and rz were rhodocylaceae whereas in rf it was bacteroidetes vadinha17 and latescibacterota the bacteria degraded refractory organics were significantly enriched in rz and rf resulting in nzvi and fe3o4 nps promoted the hydrolysis and acidification process and enhanced tcod removal after depth analysis of the bacteria at the genus level the group of syntrophic acetate oxidation bacteria including thauera clostridium sensu stricto and norank f synergistaceae were significantly enriched in rf the relative abundance of thauera clostridium sensu stricto and norank f synergistaceae in rf was 2 1 fold 1 5 fold and 5 3 fold higher than rc respectively fig s2 since thauera 24 clostridium sensu stricto 8 and norank f synergistaceae 10 reduced fe3 and oxidized organic matter and carried out extracellular electron transfer in rf the process of extracellular electron transfer and syntrophic acetate oxidation was likely improved further promoting the electron transfer efficiency of the system and increasing ch4 production the ets activity in rf was 3 15 mg mg h which was 35 higher than that in rc fig 5 the presence of fe3o4 nps increased the ets activity and promoted the electron transfer rate 31 the added fe3o4 nps in this study as magnetic materials was very likely in the system while attached to the microbial surface fe3o4 nps as a medium promoted ets of the dominant the acetic acid oxidizing bacteria including thauera clostridium sensu stricto and norank f synergistaceae and further formed diet between acetic acid oxidizing bacteria and methanogenic archaea the acetic acid oxidizing bacteria produced co2 and then co2 as the substrate was converted to ch4 by methanogenic bacteria the symbiotic relationship between acetic acid oxidizing bacteria and methanogenic bacteria enhanced the efficiency of ch4 production the relative abundance of the archaeal microbial communities showed that methanosaeta was the dominant genus of methanogenic archaea in rc rz and rf accounting for 53 5 58 6 and 65 8 respectively fig 4 b methanosaeta as an acetoclastic methanogen not only had a high affinity for acetic acid but also used the sole substrate acetic acid to produce ch4 methanosaeta was usually found to be dominant methanogens in systems with low acetic acid concentrations 23 moreover methanosaeta in the anaerobic system with the adding magnetic substance could participate in diet and further utilized co2 to produce ch4 34 35 therefore in this study methanosaeta also very likely enhanced the capability of ch4 production 3 4 the metabolic functions of anaerobic microorganisms and methanogenic metabolic pathway to further analyze the changes of microbial metabolic functions picrust2 functional prediction analysis was performed based on high throughput sequencing data the functional components in the three systems were annotated and analyzed by the kegg database the results of methane production bacterial and archaeal community structure and kegg pathway of the three systems showed that the metabolic pathway of rf was fundamentally different from that of rc and rz therefore the methane producing metabolic pathway in rf was deeply analyzed based on the abundance of genes encoding the enzymes involved in the methane metabolism module of the kegg module nsti between 0 03 0 02 and 0 17 0 02 represented the accuracy and reliability of picrust2 prediction 9 nsti of rc rz and rf were 0 11 0 11 and 0 10 respectively proving the reliability of the results 3 4 1 kegg pathway analysis the functional abundance of kegg level 1 2 3 and module in rc rz and rf were shown in fig 6 a at kegg level 1 and 2 relative abundance of all functions were similar in different systems the analysis of energy metabolism at kegg level 3 found the relative abundance of methane metabolism in rc rz and rf were 3 97 4 28 and 4 19 respectively based on the analysis of the kegg module database in the kegg database the relative abundance of the acetic acid methanogenic pathway the co2 reduced methanogenic pathway and the methylotrophic methanogenic pathway were somewhat enriched in rz whereas in rf only two methanogenic pathways the acetic acid methanogenic pathway and the co2 reduced methanogenic pathway were enriched interestingly the relative abundance of the coenzyme f420 biosynthesis pathway in rf was increased the actual measured coenzyme f420 concentration of 0 007 mmol gvss in rf reached 3 5 times than that in rc fig 5 key enzyme activities in methanogenesis were influenced by fe2 concentration in the environment 20 since fe3o4 nps could form fe2 by the reduction process of dissimilatory iron under the simulation of fe3o4 nps not only promoted the biosynthesis of f420 but also the relative abundance of f420 enzyme genes was increased thus the methanogenic process was further enhanced in rf 3 4 2 methaneogenic metabolic pathway in rf to deeply investigate the effect of fe3o4 nps on the methanogenic pathway the genes encoding important enzymes involved in five kegg modules responsible for methanogenic metabolism were detected fig 6 b showed methanogenic metabolic pathway and relative abundance of the genes encoding enzymes in rf the acetic acid methanogenic pathway and the co2 reduced methanogenic pathway were predominant in rf compared with rc formyl methanofuran dehydrogenase ec 1 2 7 12 served as an important enzyme at the initial step of the co2 reduced methanogenic pathway increased by 7 8 in addition coenzyme f420 hydrogenase ec 1 12 98 1 in rf which was responsible for transferring electrons during the reaction was 5 2 more than that in rc fig 6 c showed heatmap of the genes encoding enzymes of rc rz and rf in different methane metabolic module compared with rc the relative abundance of the genes encoding important enzymes involved in the co2 reduced methanogenic pathway was all increased in rf further confirming fe3o4 nps enhanced the co2 reduced methanogenic pathway acetyl coa could be formed through two pathways in the acetic acid methanogenic pathway mainly due to the different metabolic processes of methanosarcina and methanosaeta methanosarcina converted the acetate to acetyl coa with acetate kinase ec 2 7 2 1 and phosphate acetyltransferase ec 2 3 1 8 whereas methanosaeta used acetate coa ligase ec 6 2 1 1 to produce acetyl coa compared with rc the relative abundance of acetate coa ligase was increased by 13 12 in rf however the relative abundance of acetate kinase and phosphate acetyltransferase was decreased by 27 27 and 24 97 respectively this result was in accordance with the above obtained result that the relative abundance of methanosacrina was decreased in rf fig 4 although methanosaeta was enriched in rf further analysis of the acetic acid methanogenic pathway in rf revealed that the abundance of acetyl coa decarbonylase synthase complex ec 2 3 1 169 was decreased by 54 02 compared with rc causing the decreased utilization efficiency of acetate in rf fig 2 however the methanogenic efficiency of rf was not affected by the inhibition of the acetic acid methanogenic process but rather increased therefore it was speculated that the co2 reduced methanogenic pathway was very likely to be the main methanogenic pathway in rf methanosaeta as a specialized acetate methanogenic archaea was the dominant methanogenic archaeon in rf traditionally methanosaeta only used acetate for methanogenesis but it was reported that geobacter could transfer electrons to methanosaeta by diet in geobacter and methanosaeta aggregates which provided the conditions for methanosaeta to use co2 to produce methane 13 meanwhile the acetic acid oxidizing bacteria thauera clostridium sensu stricto and norank f synergistaceae were enriched in rf which carried out extracellular electron transfer more importantly fe3o4 nps as electron transfer carriers provided the conditions for the formation of diet between methanosaeta and acetic acid oxidizing bacteria thus extracellular electrons generated by acetic acid oxidizing bacteria were directly transferred to methanosaeta and then methanosaeta used co2 produced during the acetate oxidation to produce ch4 fig 6 b this process reduced the methanogenic lag time and rapidly entered the rapid methanogenic process which increases the system methane yield and strengthened the system methanogenic capacity this system therefore produced the most methane among the three systems despite the conversion of acetate to ch4 was somewhat inhibited 4 conclusions nzvi and fe3o4 nps not only promoted the hydrolytic fermentation process of the anaerobic biofilm system but also facilitated the removal of refractory organic matter fe3o4 nps improved the methanogenic efficiency shortened the lag time and entered the rapid methanogenic stage rapidly fe3o4 nps as a medium promoted ets of thauera clostridium sensu stricto and norank f synergistaceae and further formed diet and symbiotic relationship between these acetic acid oxidizing bacteria and the methanogenic bacteria furthermore fe3o4 nps not only promoted the biosynthesis of f420 but also the relative abundance of f420 enzyme genes was increased therefore the process of acetoclastic methanogenesis in the fe3o4 nps system was somewhat suppressed but co2 reduced methanogenesis was enhanced resulting in an increase in the system s methane production capacity credit authorship contribution statement xiuhong liu conceptualization resources supervision writing review editing shiyong zhang conceptualization formal analysis

12951,in photocatalytic oxidation reaction sulfate radicals so4 as active oxidative species is investigated rarely and is not fully understanded in this work the generation process of so4 and its effect on photodegradation reaction are mainly investigated the pre adsorption of na2so4 on bi2o2co3 is performed named as na2so4 boc it is found that after irradiation for 70 min under ultraviolet light λ 400 nm 61 and 15 of rhb are degraded by na2so4 boc and pristine boc bi2o2co3 without pre adsorption of na2so4 respectively the apparent reaction kinetic rate constant k a for na2so4 boc 0 048 min 1 has increased by 11 times compared to that of boc 0 004 min 1 besides na2so4 is also directly added in photoreaction system to compare the results show that 87 of rhb is degraded at 70 min which is significantly higher than boc the k a 0 036 min 1 of the reaction with adding na2so4 has increased by 8 times compared to boc the greatly enhanced photocatalytic activity is mainly attributed to the so4 as proved by electron spin resonance esr spectrum it is found that so4 2 anions can be converted to so4 radicals by ultraviolet light irradiation directly oh radicals and holes the newly generated so4 redox potential 2 6 v combined with oh radicals and holes synergistically improves the photocatalytic reaction the results for tio2 p25 system also confirm the substantially updated degradation ability by so4 through directly exciting so4 2 this work provides a simple low cost method to improve conventional photoreaction keywords so4 radical active oxidation species photocatalytic reaction synergistic effect 1 introduction up to now energy shortage and serious environmental pollution as urgent problems have come into notice 1 2 photocatalytic technology efficiently degrades contaminants by utilizing solar energy it shows advantages of well catalytic activity low cost stability and no secondary pollution meanwhile the shortcomings are low solar utilization rate low quantum efficiency high carrier recombination efficiency and narrow light response range among various photocatalysts bi based catalysts have shown excellent photodegradation performance in decades 3 6 typically bi2o2co3 boc has drawn more researchers attention 7 9 because it has wide application in photocatalysts 8 9 sensors and supercapacitors 10 moreover different morphologies of boc have been fabricated 9 11 15 nevertheless the photocatalytic activity of as synthesized boc is unsatisfactory thus researchers have utilized doping 16 19 depositing 20 23 and constructing heterojunctions methods to improve the photocatalytic performance heterojunctions and ions doping are usually synthesized by hydrothermal or solvent thermal methods however the methods above require the harsh reaction conditions e g high temperature high pressure etc it is necessary to develop a simple method to improve the photocatalytic activity of a photocatalyst herein we developed a simple method to enhance the photocatalytic activity of boc furthermore in photocatalysis reaction hydroxyl radicals superoxide radicals and holes as common active species are studied extensively 16 23 besides the excitation of persulfate to form so4 was reported widely 24 26 nevertheless fewer studies reported the excitation of na2so4 to directly generate so4 for example zhang et al mentioned that so4 2 ions reacted with oh to generate so4 but they found the formed so4 nearly had no contribution on the degradation of humic acid 27 shan et al reported that so4 radicals favored the catalytic ozonation of oxalic acid 28 jose et al also reported the positive influence of so4 on the degradation of chlorobenzene 29 these results suggest that so4 can accelerate the photocatalytic degradation reaction but these are only established on base of hypothesis or conjecture fewer studies have extensively investigated and definitely confirmed the detailed generation process of so4 and the actual role in photocatalytic reduction in this work we mainly investigated the generation process of so4 radicals and its role in photodegradation reaction through two strategies one is directly adding na2so4 into photoreaction system and the other is the pre adsorption of na2so4 over boc the electron spin resonance esr spectrum conformed the formation of so4 from na2so4 in boc photocatalytic reaction system besides we also investigated the influence of na2so4 added on a tio2 p25 photocatalytic reaction system the results further illustrated the formation of so4 radicals furthermore blank experiment without adding photocatalyst namely only adding na2so4 in rhb solution was also performed to explore the formation of so4 radicals under ultraviolet radiation it was found that so4 2 anions can be converted to so4 radicals by ultraviolet light oh radicals and holes the newly generated so4 radicals 2 6 v oh radicals and holes contribute to the degradation reaction synergistically this finding indicates that so4 could be applied to the other photocatalyst system widely and all the degradation efficiencies of conventional photoreactions could be updated greatly 2 experimental 2 1 pre absorption treatment of bi2o2co3 boc the synthesis of bi2o2co3 boc was given in supporting information si typically 5 mmol na2so4 was dispersed into 30 ml of distilled water 0 5 mmol the as synthesized boc 0 2550 g was added into the above solution the suspension solution maintained stirring for 48 h the precipitate was centrifuged washed with distilled water for three times and dried at 60 c for 6 h the as obtained sample was designated as na2so4 boc besides na2so4 was directly added in reaction system as comparison the characterization and electrochemical measurements were also given in si 2 2 photoreaction comparison the details of photocatalytic reaction were given in si in order to make clear when using the na2so4 boc photocatalyst above the case was named as na2so4 boc while using boc photocatalyst but directly adding na2so4 in photocatalytic reaction the case was named as na2so4 boc moreover the photocatalytic reaction was also performed under the conditions as follows 1 uv irradiation but without adding both photocatalyst and na2so4 2 uv irradiation but without photocatalyst but adding na2so4 2 3 trapping experiments and electron spin resonance esr the trapping experiments of samples are performed under uv light λ 400 nm 0 1 g catalyst and 1 mmol ammonium oxalate nh4 2c2o4 0 02 mmol benzoquinone bq 131 mmol isopropyl alcohol ipa and 4 mmol tert butanol were added to 200 ml of 7 5 mg l rhb aqueous solution as the scavengers for hole superoxide radical o2 hydroxyl radical oh and sulfate radical so4 respectively the measurement procedures were similar to the test above the electron spin resonance esr spectra were collected at 90 k using a bruker esp 500 spectrometer at a microwave frequency of 9 85 ghz 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was used to capture free radicals 3 results and discussion 3 1 structure analysis xrd patterns of na2so4 boc and pristine boc have shown in fig s1a seeing supporting information si the diffraction peaks of na2so4 boc can be well indexed with orthorhombic bi2o2co3 jcpds 841752 no other peaks can be detected which illustrates no bi based compounds formed the result indicates that pre absorption of na2so4 treatment has not changed the crystal phase of boc besides two samples show well crystallinity after pre absorption of na2so4 treatment the crystallization of na2so4 boc has slightly decreased comparing with boc compared with boc partial nanotubes are broken into smaller nanosheets or nanoparticles fig s2 seeing si resulting in the decreased crystallinity of na2so4 boc from ftir spectra of samples in fig s1b seeing si the peaks at 3433 and 1633 cm 1 are ascribed to the stretching and bending vibration of oh of surface absorbed water respectively the peaks at 1464 and 1391 cm 1 are assigned to the υ3 mode of co3 2 group while the sharp peak at 848 cm 1 is attributed to υ2 mode of co3 2 group 17 the peak at 546 cm 1 corresponds to bio bond however there is no peak appeared in range of 1210 1040 cm 1 which is assigned to so4 2 group no peak of os has appeared after pre absorption of na2so4 it could be inferred that the content of so4 2 ions is low meanwhile so4 2 ions has not entered into crystal lattice of boc fig s2 a b seeing si shows the morphology of na2so4 boc and boc the hierarchical nanotubes are composed of uniform nanoplates the length of hollow nanotube is 6 10 μm and the thickness of nanoplate is almost 200 nm compared with boc the morphology of na2so4 boc sample still maintains the tubular structure the result demonstrates that the arrangement of boc nanotubes has not been changed after pre absorption of na2so4 the formation of boc nanotubes can be described as following eqs 1 5 1 bi no 3 3 h 2 o biono 3 2h 2no 3 2 c 6 h 12 n 4 h 2 o h nh 4 hcho 3 2hcho o 2 2hcooh 4 hcooh h 2 o co 2 2h co 3 2 5 2biono 3 co 3 2 bi 2 o 2 co 3 2no 3 first biono3 is formed by hydrolysis of bi no3 3 later methenamine is hydrolyzed to form hcho under acidic condition hcho can be further oxidized to generate hcooh then co3 2 ions are decomposed from hcooh finally biono3 reacts with co3 2 to form bi2o2co3 moreover methenamine not only serves as carbon source but it also acts as surfactant meanwhile so4 2 ions have strong affinity to surfactant 30 it is necessary to investigate the chemical states of elements and surface composition of boc and na2so4 boc the surface atomic ratios have shown in table 1 xps survey spectra of boc and na2so4 boc are shown in fig 1a compared with boc the ratios of bi o and c decrease while the ratio of s increases in na2so4 boc the xps spectra of bi 4f are shown in fig 1b which can be fitted into two characteristic peaks bi 4f5 2 and bi 4f7 2 for both na2so4 boc and boc the binding energy located at 163 9 ev and 158 6 ev there is no shift to higher or lower binding energy so the valence state of bi has been not changed fig 1c shows the c 1s spectra of two samples the fitted peak at 284 8 ev is assigned to adventitious carbon for both boc and na2so4 boc while fitted peak at 288 3 ev or 288 4 ev is ascribed to carbonate 31 in boc and na2so4 boc the o 1s spectra can be fitted into three peaks surface hydroxyl groups carbonate ion and bio respectively the peak at 529 4 ev corresponds to bio the peak at 530 4 ev for o of carbonate and another peak for 530 8 ev belongs to surface oh fig 1d for boc the peak area ratio of bio co3 2 and oh is 28 61 32 49 and 38 9 respectively while for na2so4 boc the peak area ratio of bio co3 2 and oh is 24 19 39 38 and 36 43 man et al reported that the shift of o 1s to a lower binding energy was caused by the formed oxygen vacancy 7 herein no peak shift of o 1s confirmed that no oxygen vacancy formed for na2so4 boc however there is no peak appeared in na 1s spectra fig 1e the atomic concentration of na is only 0 6 the low content of na comes from na2so4 no peak can be ascribed to na 1s is reasonable while the atomic concentration of s is 1 37 in na2so4 boc in fig 1f the peak at binding energy of 168 8 ev can be fitted to s 2p3 2 it has been reported that the binding energy of s 2p3 2 s6 is 168 8 ev thus the valence state of s is 6 in na2so4 boc meanwhile no peaks appeared at binding energy of 225 ev and 161 162 ev which corresponds to s 2s and s 2p respectively 32 the results illustrate that the valence state of s has not changed so it can be concluded that s on na2so4 boc come from absorbed so4 2 on surface the result indicates that s has not substituted o in boc thus so4 2 ions have not substitute for co3 2 ions 3 2 optical property as shown in fig s3 a b seeing si the absorption edges and tauc plots of boc and na2so4 boc the absorption edge of na2so4 boc has no shift to visible or ultraviolet region comparing with boc 380 nm it can be concluded that the band gaps e g of boc and na2so4 boc have not changed the light absorption edge is still in uv region the band gap e g can be calculated according to the eq 6 as follows 6 αhv a hv e g n 2 α hv and a are absorption coefficient photonic energy and constant value respectively boc is indirect band gap thus n is 4 the band gap is determined to be 3 24 ev for boc and na2so4 boc it is found that band gap of na2so4 boc has not changed after pre absorption of na2so4 furthermore using following expressions can determine the cb and vb positions 7 e vb χ 0 5 e g e c 8 e cb e vb e g herein χ is geometric average of absolute electronegativity of constituent atoms and e c is energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale 4 5 ev χ value is calculated to be 6 54 ev for boc the e vb and e cb are 3 66 and 0 42 ev for boc respectively these values of na2so4 boc are consistent with boc so4 2 ions mainly absorbed on surface of boc which has not changed the band structure the photoluminescence pl spectra reflect the recombination efficiency of photogenerated carriers which is displayed in fig 2a according to the results the emission intensity at 470 nm of boc and na2so4 boc is similar the excitation wavelength is 260 nm herein the photocarriers separation efficiency of two samples is very close fig 2b shows the spv spectra for boc and na2so4 boc both two samples show negative signals which means the electrons mainly migrate to catalyst surface moreover the photovoltage signal intensity of two samples is similar thus the number of electrons has transferred to catalyst surface is similar as shown in fig 2c the photocurrent spectra of samples the intensity of na2so4 boc is higher than boc illustrating the charge separation efficiency of na2so4 boc is higher in addition the mott schottky plots of samples have shown in fig 2d the positive slope of samples illustrates an n type semiconductor the cb potential φ cb is calculated by eq 9 9 e φ cb φ fb where φ fb is flat band potential for n type semiconductor e is 0 2 v 33 φ fb is calculated to be 0 86 v vs rhe for boc the cb potential of boc is 0 12 v vs rhe based on the band gap energy obtained by the uv vis drs results the vb potential φ vb is 3 36 v vs reverse hydrogen electrode rhe for boc these values of na2so4 boc keep same with boc the band structure has not changed because so4 2 ions are only absorbed on surface of boc however the carrier density of boc and na2so4 boc are 1 07 1020 cm 3 and 2 21 1020 cm 3 respectively the higher carrier density of na2so4 boc than boc would favor photocatalytic reaction 3 3 so4 improved photocatalytic degradation reaction fig 3 a b shows the ultraviolet light photoactivity and apparent reaction kinetic curves of the samples for the degradation rhb λ 400 nm both boc and na2so4 boc are porous microtube structure in photocatalytic degradation rhb molecules in bulk solution would diffuse to get into microtube interior and adsorb on the internal surface namely the mass transfer process needs a certain time the mass transfer process may affect and slow down the degradation reaction thus the rhb degradation curve has a platform at the beginning after 90 min irradiation 93 and 33 of rhb are photodegraded by na2so4 boc and boc respectively the apparent reaction kinetic rate constant k a for na2so4 boc 0 048 min 1 is 12 times as high as that of boc 0 004 min 1 it is distinct that na2so4 boc shows a notably higher photocatalytic activity than boc besides trapping experiments are performed to investigate the main active species in degradation reaction in which ammonium oxalate nh4 2c2o4 benzoquinone bq and isopropyl alcohol ipa are employed as hole h superoxide radical o2 and hydroxyl radical oh scavengers respectively when adding nh4 2c2o4 or bq the photoactivity of boc significantly decreased fig 3c while adding ipa the activity of boc almost unchanged the result illustrate hole and o2 radical are main active species for boc but oh is not the main active species for na2so4 boc fig 3d whether adding nh4 2c2o4 ipa or bq the photoactivity has decreased hence after pre absorption of na2so4 all holes o2 and oh radicals are main oxidative species to investigate the higher photoactivity of na2so4 boc bet surface area of boc and na2so4 boc have been measured table 1 which are 18 4 and 17 3 m2 g 1 respectively besides the average pore diameter of na2so4 boc 38 9 nm is smaller than boc 49 8 nm fig s4 a b seeing si although the nanotube structure of na2so4 boc has not been changed comparing with boc the decrease of pore diameter may lead to generation of more absorption sites meanwhile the absorption edges of na2so4 boc have not changed thus it is inferred the photocatalytic activity of na2so4 boc is mainly affected by pre absorption of na2so4 treatment to further investigate the formation of sulfate radical so4 electron spin resonance esr spin trap technique was conducted by using dmpo 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide as nitrone spin trapping reagent fig 4 presents the esr spectra of na2so4 and na2so4 boc boc with adding na2so4 under dark and illumination conditions under darkness no esr signals was detected in na2so4 and na2so4 boc system fig 4 a b while illumination for 5 min the characteristic signal of dmpo o2 was detected clearly in na2so4 boc system confirming the formation of superoxide radical o2 however no signal appeared in only na2so4 system without boc confirming active radicals cannot generate without boc moreover the characteristic esr signals of dmpo oh and dmpo so4 were clearly noticed under illumination fig 4 c d liu et al have investigated the main reactive radicals in nh2 mil 101 fe ps persulfate system by esr the strong dmpo so4 and dmpo oh signals indicated that significant so4 and oh generated during the degradation of bisphenol f bpf 24 the esr results above firmly confirmed the formation of both oh and so4 in boc na2so4 system this is the direct evidence the existence of so4 summarily so4 active oxidation species formed indeed it is important to investigate the influence of adding na2so4 in reaction system first the blank experiment has been performed fig 5a only 33 of rhb is self degraded after 150 min suggesting the dye self degradation is not the main factor which accelerates the photodegradation reaction keeping the same conditions and adding 80 mg l na2so4 to investigate the influence on photodegradation reaction the result illustrates photocatalytic activity of boc has remarkably enhanced after adding na2so4 so4 2 ions play a decisive role in enhancing photocatalytic activity of boc to investigate the influence of different anion sodium salts na2co3 and na3po4 are selected to compare with na2so4 fig 5a before photocatalytic reaction proper amount keeping the same molar of na na2co3 and na3po4 are added in rhb reaction system respectively it is obvious that addition of co3 2 ions accelerates photocatalytic activity while po4 3 ions restrain photodegradation performance of boc both two anions rapidly hydrolyze in solution which causes ph significantly increased it has been reported that ph is the vital factor on photodegradation process 34 in summary acid condition is beneficial for rhb degradation which has been reported in literatures according to above results it is inferred that so4 2 ions may form so4 radicals so the photodegradation activity has improved in fig 5b adding tert butanol as the so4 radical scavenger to explore the existence of sulfate radicals so4 in rhb reaction system the photocatalytic activity of na2so4 boc significantly decreased after adding tert butanol the result illustrates that so4 radical exist in degradation reaction so4 radical shows positive influence on the degradation performance moreover the photocatalytic activity of adding scavenger in rhb reaction system boc na2so4 also obviously decreased this result also illustrates the existence of so4 radical above results illustrates that so4 2 ions can form so4 in photocatalytic reaction combined with trapping experiments both so4 and oh occupy the main position in photodegrading rhb it also explains the main active species of na2so4 boc is oh and so4 3 4 generation of so4 and the synergistical role in photocatalytic reaction to further investigate the influence of so4 radical in photocatalytic reaction tio2 p25 was selected as contrast photocatalysts as shown in fig 6 a b only 55 of rhb is photodegraded by p25 20 mg within 20 min under ultraviolet light irradiation λ 400 nm whether adding 10 mg l 20 mg l or 40 mg l na2so4 designated as s1 s2 and s3 in reaction system the photocatalytic activity of p25 has obviously improved 93 75 and 65 of rhb are photodegraded by s1 s2 and s3 within 20 min respectively the k a for s1 0 159 min 1 s2 0 105 min 1 and s3 0 086 min 1 are 3 4 2 2 and 1 8 times as high as p25 0 047 min 1 respectively the enhanced photocatalytic activity illustrates the existence of so4 radical besides we also have explored the existence of so4 radicals in self degradation of rhb in fig 6 c d the self degradation performance of rhb is obviously enhanced after adding 10 mg l na2so4 named as 2 rhb the k a for 2 rhb 0 006 min 1 is 2 times higher than that of self degradation 0 002 min 1 under ultraviolet irradiation so4 2 anions are excited to generate so4 radicals the oxidation active species have increased so the self degradation activity has enhanced while adding 40 mg l and 80 mg l na2so4 into self degradation system without adding photocatalyst the photodegradation activity of rhb did not change the result indicates that excessive na2so4 may occupy the surface active sites thus decreasing the degradation efficiency therefore an appropriate amount of na2so4 is necessary to improve photocatalytic degradation reaction moreover it is necessary to explore the formation of so4 radicals in photocatalytic reaction under ultraviolet irradiation adding so4 radical scavenger to prove whether so4 radicals can be formed in reaction system na2so4 rhb the photocatalytic activity of rhb is significantly decreased so minor so4 2 ions can be directly excited to form so4 radicals these results illustrate that the formation of so4 radicals is relative to the amount of na2so4 the proper amount na2so4 is beneficial to the generation of so4 radicals the influence of adding na2so4 significantly accelerates rhb self degradation thereby confirming minor so4 2 can directly form so4 radicals under ultraviolet light radiation the self degradation percentage of rhb was enhanced by 2 times compared to that without adding na2so4 while in the presences of boc and p25 the degradation ratios of rhb have increased by 9 times and 3 4 times compared to that only with catalyst but without adding na2so4 respectively the formation mechanism of so4 radicals in photodegradation reaction has been provided as follow first the unstable n ions of rhb is attracted by so4 2 ions on surface of boc under ultraviolet light irradiation minor so4 2 ions can be excited to generate so4 meanwhile so4 2 ions can react with oh then formation of so4 radical furthermore boc is excited to generate photogenerated holes h partial h react with so4 2 ions to generate so4 radical the oxidation potential of so4 is 2 6 v which is smaller than oh 2 8 v 25 as strong oxidizers either so4 or oh can directly oxidate rhb and accelerate photocatalytic reaction according to previous research 27 29 35 36 the lifetime of so4 is longer than that of oh 29 furthermore ph value is vital for both so4 and oh when ph value is below 7 h ions are constantly consumed by so4 2 acid condition contributes to form so4 36 the higher degradation performance can be explained jose et al have evaluated so4 2 ions exhibited positive influence on degradation chlorobenzene 29 shan et al reported that addition of so4 2 ions is beneficial for photocatalytic oxalic acid 28 so4 radicals can accelerate the degradation of organic compounds 36 in a word under ultraviolet irradiation on one hand minor so4 2 ions can be directly excited to form so4 radicals on the other hand so4 2 absorbed on surface of boc reacts with oh generating so4 radical photogenerated h of boc react with so4 2 ions to generate so4 radical then so4 radical contributes to photodegrade organic pollution thus rhb is completely degraded by na2so4 boc notably the existence of so4 radicals in degradation reaction has confirmed by trapping and blank experiments based on above analysis both so4 and oh contribute to the degradation reaction thus pre absorption of na2so4 treatment can obviously enhance the photocatalytic activity the reaction mechanism as follows eqs 10 14 10 boc hv e h 11 hv h oh so 4 2 so 4 h oh 12 h h 2 o oh h 13 oh rhb co 2 h 2 o 14 so 4 rhb co 2 h 2 o 4 conclusions briefly the photodegradation ratio of rhb has been increased by 8 11 times in the presence of na2so4 the enhanced photocatalytic activity is mainly attributed to the in situ generated so4 radicals from so4 2 ions so4 2 ions can convert to so4 radicals by ultraviolet light irradiation oh and holes the newly generated so4 as new active oxidation species combining oh radicals and holes synergistically improve the photodegradation reaction both boc and tio2 p25 systems confirm the feasible

12951,in photocatalytic oxidation reaction sulfate radicals so4 as active oxidative species is investigated rarely and is not fully understanded in this work the generation process of so4 and its effect on photodegradation reaction are mainly investigated the pre adsorption of na2so4 on bi2o2co3 is performed named as na2so4 boc it is found that after irradiation for 70 min under ultraviolet light λ 400 nm 61 and 15 of rhb are degraded by na2so4 boc and pristine boc bi2o2co3 without pre adsorption of na2so4 respectively the apparent reaction kinetic rate constant k a for na2so4 boc 0 048 min 1 has increased by 11 times compared to that of boc 0 004 min 1 besides na2so4 is also directly added in photoreaction system to compare the results show that 87 of rhb is degraded at 70 min which is significantly higher than boc the k a 0 036 min 1 of the reaction with adding na2so4 has increased by 8 times compared to boc the greatly enhanced photocatalytic activity is mainly attributed to the so4 as proved by electron spin resonance esr spectrum it is found that so4 2 anions can be converted to so4 radicals by ultraviolet light irradiation directly oh radicals and holes the newly generated so4 redox potential 2 6 v combined with oh radicals and holes synergistically improves the photocatalytic reaction the results for tio2 p25 system also confirm the substantially updated degradation ability by so4 through directly exciting so4 2 this work provides a simple low cost method to improve conventional photoreaction keywords so4 radical active oxidation species photocatalytic reaction synergistic effect 1 introduction up to now energy shortage and serious environmental pollution as urgent problems have come into notice 1 2 photocatalytic technology efficiently degrades contaminants by utilizing solar energy it shows advantages of well catalytic activity low cost stability and no secondary pollution meanwhile the shortcomings are low solar utilization rate low quantum efficiency high carrier recombination efficiency and narrow light response range among various photocatalysts bi based catalysts have shown excellent photodegradation performance in decades 3 6 typically bi2o2co3 boc has drawn more researchers attention 7 9 because it has wide application in photocatalysts 8 9 sensors and supercapacitors 10 moreover different morphologies of boc have been fabricated 9 11 15 nevertheless the photocatalytic activity of as synthesized boc is unsatisfactory thus researchers have utilized doping 16 19 depositing 20 23 and constructing heterojunctions methods to improve the photocatalytic performance heterojunctions and ions doping are usually synthesized by hydrothermal or solvent thermal methods however the methods above require the harsh reaction conditions e g high temperature high pressure etc it is necessary to develop a simple method to improve the photocatalytic activity of a photocatalyst herein we developed a simple method to enhance the photocatalytic activity of boc furthermore in photocatalysis reaction hydroxyl radicals superoxide radicals and holes as common active species are studied extensively 16 23 besides the excitation of persulfate to form so4 was reported widely 24 26 nevertheless fewer studies reported the excitation of na2so4 to directly generate so4 for example zhang et al mentioned that so4 2 ions reacted with oh to generate so4 but they found the formed so4 nearly had no contribution on the degradation of humic acid 27 shan et al reported that so4 radicals favored the catalytic ozonation of oxalic acid 28 jose et al also reported the positive influence of so4 on the degradation of chlorobenzene 29 these results suggest that so4 can accelerate the photocatalytic degradation reaction but these are only established on base of hypothesis or conjecture fewer studies have extensively investigated and definitely confirmed the detailed generation process of so4 and the actual role in photocatalytic reduction in this work we mainly investigated the generation process of so4 radicals and its role in photodegradation reaction through two strategies one is directly adding na2so4 into photoreaction system and the other is the pre adsorption of na2so4 over boc the electron spin resonance esr spectrum conformed the formation of so4 from na2so4 in boc photocatalytic reaction system besides we also investigated the influence of na2so4 added on a tio2 p25 photocatalytic reaction system the results further illustrated the formation of so4 radicals furthermore blank experiment without adding photocatalyst namely only adding na2so4 in rhb solution was also performed to explore the formation of so4 radicals under ultraviolet radiation it was found that so4 2 anions can be converted to so4 radicals by ultraviolet light oh radicals and holes the newly generated so4 radicals 2 6 v oh radicals and holes contribute to the degradation reaction synergistically this finding indicates that so4 could be applied to the other photocatalyst system widely and all the degradation efficiencies of conventional photoreactions could be updated greatly 2 experimental 2 1 pre absorption treatment of bi2o2co3 boc the synthesis of bi2o2co3 boc was given in supporting information si typically 5 mmol na2so4 was dispersed into 30 ml of distilled water 0 5 mmol the as synthesized boc 0 2550 g was added into the above solution the suspension solution maintained stirring for 48 h the precipitate was centrifuged washed with distilled water for three times and dried at 60 c for 6 h the as obtained sample was designated as na2so4 boc besides na2so4 was directly added in reaction system as comparison the characterization and electrochemical measurements were also given in si 2 2 photoreaction comparison the details of photocatalytic reaction were given in si in order to make clear when using the na2so4 boc photocatalyst above the case was named as na2so4 boc while using boc photocatalyst but directly adding na2so4 in photocatalytic reaction the case was named as na2so4 boc moreover the photocatalytic reaction was also performed under the conditions as follows 1 uv irradiation but without adding both photocatalyst and na2so4 2 uv irradiation but without photocatalyst but adding na2so4 2 3 trapping experiments and electron spin resonance esr the trapping experiments of samples are performed under uv light λ 400 nm 0 1 g catalyst and 1 mmol ammonium oxalate nh4 2c2o4 0 02 mmol benzoquinone bq 131 mmol isopropyl alcohol ipa and 4 mmol tert butanol were added to 200 ml of 7 5 mg l rhb aqueous solution as the scavengers for hole superoxide radical o2 hydroxyl radical oh and sulfate radical so4 respectively the measurement procedures were similar to the test above the electron spin resonance esr spectra were collected at 90 k using a bruker esp 500 spectrometer at a microwave frequency of 9 85 ghz 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo was used to capture free radicals 3 results and discussion 3 1 structure analysis xrd patterns of na2so4 boc and pristine boc have shown in fig s1a seeing supporting information si the diffraction peaks of na2so4 boc can be well indexed with orthorhombic bi2o2co3 jcpds 841752 no other peaks can be detected which illustrates no bi based compounds formed the result indicates that pre absorption of na2so4 treatment has not changed the crystal phase of boc besides two samples show well crystallinity after pre absorption of na2so4 treatment the crystallization of na2so4 boc has slightly decreased comparing with boc compared with boc partial nanotubes are broken into smaller nanosheets or nanoparticles fig s2 seeing si resulting in the decreased crystallinity of na2so4 boc from ftir spectra of samples in fig s1b seeing si the peaks at 3433 and 1633 cm 1 are ascribed to the stretching and bending vibration of oh of surface absorbed water respectively the peaks at 1464 and 1391 cm 1 are assigned to the υ3 mode of co3 2 group while the sharp peak at 848 cm 1 is attributed to υ2 mode of co3 2 group 17 the peak at 546 cm 1 corresponds to bio bond however there is no peak appeared in range of 1210 1040 cm 1 which is assigned to so4 2 group no peak of os has appeared after pre absorption of na2so4 it could be inferred that the content of so4 2 ions is low meanwhile so4 2 ions has not entered into crystal lattice of boc fig s2 a b seeing si shows the morphology of na2so4 boc and boc the hierarchical nanotubes are composed of uniform nanoplates the length of hollow nanotube is 6 10 μm and the thickness of nanoplate is almost 200 nm compared with boc the morphology of na2so4 boc sample still maintains the tubular structure the result demonstrates that the arrangement of boc nanotubes has not been changed after pre absorption of na2so4 the formation of boc nanotubes can be described as following eqs 1 5 1 bi no 3 3 h 2 o biono 3 2h 2no 3 2 c 6 h 12 n 4 h 2 o h nh 4 hcho 3 2hcho o 2 2hcooh 4 hcooh h 2 o co 2 2h co 3 2 5 2biono 3 co 3 2 bi 2 o 2 co 3 2no 3 first biono3 is formed by hydrolysis of bi no3 3 later methenamine is hydrolyzed to form hcho under acidic condition hcho can be further oxidized to generate hcooh then co3 2 ions are decomposed from hcooh finally biono3 reacts with co3 2 to form bi2o2co3 moreover methenamine not only serves as carbon source but it also acts as surfactant meanwhile so4 2 ions have strong affinity to surfactant 30 it is necessary to investigate the chemical states of elements and surface composition of boc and na2so4 boc the surface atomic ratios have shown in table 1 xps survey spectra of boc and na2so4 boc are shown in fig 1a compared with boc the ratios of bi o and c decrease while the ratio of s increases in na2so4 boc the xps spectra of bi 4f are shown in fig 1b which can be fitted into two characteristic peaks bi 4f5 2 and bi 4f7 2 for both na2so4 boc and boc the binding energy located at 163 9 ev and 158 6 ev there is no shift to higher or lower binding energy so the valence state of bi has been not changed fig 1c shows the c 1s spectra of two samples the fitted peak at 284 8 ev is assigned to adventitious carbon for both boc and na2so4 boc while fitted peak at 288 3 ev or 288 4 ev is ascribed to carbonate 31 in boc and na2so4 boc the o 1s spectra can be fitted into three peaks surface hydroxyl groups carbonate ion and bio respectively the peak at 529 4 ev corresponds to bio the peak at 530 4 ev for o of carbonate and another peak for 530 8 ev belongs to surface oh fig 1d for boc the peak area ratio of bio co3 2 and oh is 28 61 32 49 and 38 9 respectively while for na2so4 boc the peak area ratio of bio co3 2 and oh is 24 19 39 38 and 36 43 man et al reported that the shift of o 1s to a lower binding energy was caused by the formed oxygen vacancy 7 herein no peak shift of o 1s confirmed that no oxygen vacancy formed for na2so4 boc however there is no peak appeared in na 1s spectra fig 1e the atomic concentration of na is only 0 6 the low content of na comes from na2so4 no peak can be ascribed to na 1s is reasonable while the atomic concentration of s is 1 37 in na2so4 boc in fig 1f the peak at binding energy of 168 8 ev can be fitted to s 2p3 2 it has been reported that the binding energy of s 2p3 2 s6 is 168 8 ev thus the valence state of s is 6 in na2so4 boc meanwhile no peaks appeared at binding energy of 225 ev and 161 162 ev which corresponds to s 2s and s 2p respectively 32 the results illustrate that the valence state of s has not changed so it can be concluded that s on na2so4 boc come from absorbed so4 2 on surface the result indicates that s has not substituted o in boc thus so4 2 ions have not substitute for co3 2 ions 3 2 optical property as shown in fig s3 a b seeing si the absorption edges and tauc plots of boc and na2so4 boc the absorption edge of na2so4 boc has no shift to visible or ultraviolet region comparing with boc 380 nm it can be concluded that the band gaps e g of boc and na2so4 boc have not changed the light absorption edge is still in uv region the band gap e g can be calculated according to the eq 6 as follows 6 αhv a hv e g n 2 α hv and a are absorption coefficient photonic energy and constant value respectively boc is indirect band gap thus n is 4 the band gap is determined to be 3 24 ev for boc

8 e cb e vb e g herein χ is geometric average of absolute electronegativity of constituent atoms and e c is energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale 4 5 ev χ value is calculated to be 6 54 ev for boc the e vb and e cb are 3 66 and 0 42 ev for boc respectively these values of na2so4 boc are consistent with boc so4 2 ions mainly absorbed on surface of boc which has not changed the band structure the photoluminescence pl spectra reflect the recombination efficiency of photogenerated carriers which is displayed in fig 2a according to the results the emission intensity at 470 nm of boc and na2so4 boc is similar the excitation wavelength is 260 nm herein the photocarriers separation efficiency of two samples is very close fig 2b shows the spv spectra for boc and na2so4 boc both two

ions play a decisive role in enhancing photocatalytic activity of boc to investigate the influence of different anion sodium salts na2co3 and na3po4 are selected to compare with na2so4 fig 5a before photocatalytic reaction proper amount keeping the same molar of na na2co3 and na3po4 are added in rhb reaction system respectively it is obvious that addition of co3 2 ions accelerates photocatalytic activity while po4 3 ions restrain photodegradation performance of boc both two anions rapidly hydrolyze in solution which causes ph significantly increased it has been reported that ph is the vital factor on photodegradation process 34 in summary acid condition is beneficial for rhb degradation which has been reported in literatures according to above results it is inferred that so4 2 ions may form so4 radicals so the photodegradation activity has improved in fig 5b adding tert butanol as the so4 radical scavenger to explore the existence of sulfate radicals so4 in rhb reaction system the photocatalytic activity of na2so4 boc significantly decreased after adding tert butanol the result illustrates that so4 radical exist in degradation reaction so4 radical shows positive influence on the degradation performance moreover the photocatalytic activity of adding scavenger in rhb reaction system boc na2so4 also obviously decreased this result also illustrates the existence of so4 radical above results illustrates that so4 2 ions can form so4 in photocatalytic reaction combined with trapping experiments both so4 and oh occupy the main position in photodegrading rhb it also explains the main active species of na2so4 boc is oh and so4 3 4 generation of so4 and the synergistical role in photocatalytic reaction to further investigate the influence of so4 radical in photocatalytic reaction tio2 p25 was selected as contrast photocatalysts as shown in fig 6 a b only 55 of rhb is photodegraded by p25 20 mg within 20 min under ultraviolet light irradiation λ 400 nm whether adding 10 mg l 20 mg l or 40 mg l na2so4 designated as s1 s2 and s3 in reaction system the photocatalytic activity of p25 has obviously improved 93 75 and 65 of rhb are photodegraded by s1 s2 and s3 within 20 min respectively the k a for s1 0 159 min 1 s2 0 105 min 1 and s3 0 086 min 1 are 3 4 2 2 and 1 8 times as high as p25 0 047 min 1 respectively the enhanced photocatalytic activity illustrates the existence of so4 radical besides we also have explored the existence of so4 radicals in self degradation of rhb in fig 6 c d the self degradation performance of rhb is obviously enhanced after adding 10 mg l na2so4 named as 2 rhb the k a for 2 rhb 0 006 min 1 is 2 times higher than that of self degradation 0 002 min 1 under ultraviolet irradiation so4 2 anions are excited to generate so4 radicals the oxidation active species have increased so the self degradation activity has enhanced while adding 40 mg l and 80 mg l na2so4 into self degradation system without adding photocatalyst the photodegradation activity of rhb did not change the result indicates that excessive na2so4 may occupy the surface active sites thus decreasing the degradation efficiency therefore an appropriate amount of na2so4 is necessary to improve photocatalytic degradation reaction moreover it is necessary to explore the formation of so4 radicals in photocatalytic reaction under ultraviolet irradiation adding so4 radical scavenger to prove whether so4 radicals can be formed in reaction system na2so4 rhb the photocatalytic activity of rhb is significantly decreased so minor so4 2 ions can be directly excited to form so4 radicals these results illustrate that the formation of so4 radicals is relative to the amount of na2so4 the proper amount na2so4 is beneficial to the generation of so4 radicals the influence of adding na2so4 significantly accelerates rhb self degradation thereby confirming minor so4 2 can directly form so4 radicals under ultraviolet light radiation the self degradation percentage of rhb was enhanced by 2 times compared to that without adding na2so4 while in the presences of boc and p25 the degradation ratios of rhb have increased by 9 times and 3 4 times compared to that only with catalyst but without adding na2so4 respectively the formation mechanism of so4 radicals in photodegradation reaction has been provided as follow first the unstable n ions of rhb is attracted by so4 2 ions on surface of boc under ultraviolet light irradiation minor so4 2 ions can be excited to generate so4 meanwhile so4 2 ions can react with oh then formation of so4 radical furthermore boc is excited to generate photogenerated holes h partial h react with so4 2 ions to generate so4 radical the oxidation potential of so4 is 2 6 v which is smaller than oh 2 8 v 25 as strong oxidizers either so4 or oh can directly oxidate rhb and accelerate photocatalytic reaction according to previous research 27 29 35 36 the lifetime of so4 is longer than that of oh 29 furthermore ph value is vital for both so4 and oh when ph value is below 7 h ions are constantly consumed by so4 2 acid condition contributes to form so4 36 the higher degradation performance can be explained jose et al have evaluated so4 2 ions exhibited positive influence on degradation chlorobenzene 29 shan et al reported that addition of so4 2 ions is beneficial for photocatalytic oxalic acid 28 so4 radicals can accelerate the degradation of organic compounds 36 in a word under ultraviolet irradiation on one hand minor so4 2 ions can be directly excited to form so4 radicals on the other hand so4 2 absorbed on surface of boc reacts with oh generating so4 radical photogenerated h of boc react with so4 2 ions to generate so4 radical then so4 radical contributes to photodegrade organic pollution thus rhb is completely degraded by na2so4 boc notably the existence of so4 radicals in degradation reaction has confirmed by trapping and blank experiments based on above analysis both so4 and oh contribute to the degradation reaction thus pre absorption of na2so4 treatment can obviously enhance the photocatalytic activity the reaction mechanism as follows eqs 10 14 10 boc hv e h 11 hv h oh so 4 2 so 4 h oh 12 h h 2 o oh h 13 oh rhb co 2 h 2 o 14 so 4 rhb co 2 h 2 o 4 conclusions briefly the photodegradation ratio of rhb has been increased by 8 11 times in the presence of na2so4 the enhanced photocatalytic activity is mainly attributed to the in situ generated so4 radicals from so4 2 ions so4 2 ions can convert to so4 radicals by ultraviolet light irradiation oh and holes the newly generated so4 as new active oxidation species combining oh radicals and holes synergistically improve the photodegradation reaction both boc and tio2 p25 systems confirm the feasible

12952,the ozone based advanced oxidation process in wastewater effluent degrades refractory organics efficiently and significantly nevertheless high energy consumption is a challenge that hinders its widespread application in this work the pre coagulation enhanced catalytic ozonation process for the treatment of biologically treated coking wastewater btcw was investigated the chemical oxygen demand cod removal results indicated that catalytic ozonation has an inadequate removal effect on the organic pollutants in btcw moreover the two stage degradation occurred in the cod ozonation process of which the slow reaction rate in the second stage was the main reason that limited its overall effect the pre coagulation overcame the obstacle of the limited effect of catalytic ozonation treatment of btcw because of its ability to remove hydrophobic organics the combination of pre coagulation with catalytic ozonation could increase the cod removal efficiency from 45 to 69 compared with catalytic ozonation alone there was a linear relationship between specific ozone consumption and ozone dosage regardless of whether btcw was subjected to pre coagulation the fact that the slope of this linear relationship with pre coagulation was much smaller than that without pre coagulation it indicates that pre coagulation could significantly reduce ozone consumption the primary role of pre coagulation was to reduce ozone consumption considerably in the second stage of the ozonation process the ozone consumption per unit mass of cod in the second stage reached 24 3 go3 gcod without pre coagulation while that was only 6 8 go3 gcod with pre coagulation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords coking wastewater catalytic ozonation pre coagulation kinetic model consumption analysis 1 introduction coking wastewater is complex industrial wastewater produced by coking plants it is generated by coke quenching and coking gas purification during the coking process 1 the components of coking wastewater are extraordinarily complex and are rich in refractory organic compounds including phenols polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and cyanides 2 the traditional treatment technology of coking wastewater mainly uses biological treatment because of its low cost and a high degree of pollutants mineralization anoxic aerobic a o or anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2 o processes are the main processes for coking wastewater treatment in china 3 5 however due to the presence of a large number of refractory and inhibitory pollutants the biologically treated coking wastewater btcw still contains a relatively high concentration of non biodegradable organic pollutants 6 8 as refractory pollutants in coking wastewater receive more attention china has strengthened the national discharge standards for coking wastewater 9 making btcw unable to satisfy the discharge standards as a result the advanced treatment technology of coking wastewater is becoming increasingly important currently various technologies have been proposed for the advanced treatment of btcw such as advanced oxidation processes aops adsorption technologies and membrane filtrations ozone is a strong oxidant with electrophilic properties and it reacts rapidly with electron rich groups 10 besides hydroxyl radicals oh which are secondary oxidants produced by ozone s self decomposition contribute significantly to removing organic compounds without electron rich groups 11 furthermore the catalytic ozonation process uses catalysts to promote the decomposition of ozone which increases the oh generation 12 thereby improving the efficiency of removing pollutants consequently as one of the aops the catalytic ozonation process has received growing attention in wastewater treatment due to its capacity for degradation and mineralization pollutants especially in removing refractory organic substances 13 the catalytic ozonation process can effectively eliminate micro pollutants e g pharmaceutical 14 18 and pesticides 19 22 in the secondary effluent of municipal sewage or drinking water sources and reduce the toxicity of these micro pollutants through degradation or mineralization catalytic ozonation also plays an essential role in the tertiary treatment of many types of industrial wastewater e g petrochemical wastewater 23 27 coal chemical wastewater 28 29 and dye wastewater 13 30 however even though many studies have confirmed that catalytic ozonation in wastewater effluent degrades refractory organics efficiently and significantly challenges need to be solved that hamper wide application one of the main limitations of catalytic ozonation treatment for industrial wastewater is that this process increases the treatment costs 31 additionally many different organic pollutants with various chemical structures are present in wastewater effluent 32 and their reaction rates with ozone and hydroxyl radicals vary considerably 33 on top of that the effluent matrix of different industries varies greatly the overall removal of organic pollutants varies depending on the pollutant composition and concentration in the wastewater matrix during the tertiary treatment process with catalytic ozonation ozone reactive pollutants oraps with electron rich moieties erms can be more efficiently eliminated than ozone resistant pollutants orsps without erms due to the combined reaction with ozone and oh 34 organic contaminants in the water matrix can be divided into oraps and orsps when the high content of orsps is present in the wastewater matrix the polluted water is difficult to purify by ozonation because of the low reactivity of orsps with ozone as such understanding the kinetic elimination characteristics of organic pollutants in the process of catalytic ozonation has become a crucial matter which contributes to the analysis of influencing factors during the advanced treatment of btcw by catalytic ozonation it also can promote the development of effective methods to eliminate pollutants furthermore as the catalytic ozonation process is an energy consuming method 13 it is necessary to consider the ozone demand and associated energy requirements when increasing the degradation rate of organic pollutants the coagulation process is a crucial treatment technology with a wide range of applications in advanced water and wastewater treatment facilities 35 36 pre coagulation provides a treatment alternative to removing pollutants before an ozonation process pre coagulation with different kinds of aluminum salts and iron salts has become a typical wastewater treatment process to remove particles nutrients and organic pollutants studies have shown that pre coagulation preferentially removes dissolved organic matter dom with higher molecular weight 37 39 the pre coagulation process has been widely used in the treatment of various types of industrial wastewater such as dye textile wastewater 40 food processing industry wastewater 41 43 pulp and paper wastewater 44 46 etc the coagulation mechanism includes neutralizing the charge of negatively charged organics by hydrated oxide metal cations and by adsorption and entrapment of dom onto the surface of the sediment of insoluble metal hydrated oxide 47 therefore pre coagulation may have effects on the rate of subsequent catalytic ozonation however to the best of our knowledge there are few reports on the effect of pre coagulation on the degradation kinetics of organic pollutants in btcw and the ozone consumption during catalytic ozonation in the present study the principal objectives are therefore i to understand the kinetics of organic pollutants degradation during btcw treatment by applying catalytic ozonation with aluminum based catalysts and analyze the factors affecting the degradation rate from the perspective of kinetics ii to investigate the abatement of organic pollutants during btcw treatment by applying catalytic ozonation combined with pre coagulation and iii to propose feasible methods to promote catalytic ozonation efficiency considering pollutants elimination rate and treatment cost 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater samples the actual btcw samples were obtained from the secondary sedimentation tank of a two stage a o process of a coal chemical factory in the inner mongolia of northwest china the basic quality of the biologically treated coking wastewater btcw is as follows chemical oxygen demand cod 280 320 mg l dissolved organic carbon doc 78 83 mg l

study fig 1 the ozonation reactor is a cylindrical glass reactor with a diameter of 6 cm and a height of 180 cm the reactor has four sampling ports numbered 1 4 from bottom to top sampling ports 1 and 4 are connected by a peristaltic pump bt100 2 j shenchen pump co ltd china to thoroughly mix the wastewater and ozone the reactor is filled with 25 35 volume of aluminum based commercial catalyst made of alumina pellets covered with cerium and manganese oxides shuimengyuan technology co china an oxygen source ozone generator tonglin technology co china 2 g h was used to supply the ozone for the experiments an ozone concentration analyzer was used to monitor the ozone concentration take a sample at a specific time from sampling port 3 and test its cod concentration 2 3 experimental procedure pre coagulation experiments were performed using a six paddle agitation device meiyu environmental equipment co china during the pre coagulation analytical grades of polyaluminum chloride pac and fe2 so4 3 were used as coagulants which were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd the coagulant stock solution was prepared to a concentration of 20 g l for subsequent experiments the coagulation experiments were conducted in 1 l beakers at room temperature the different concentrations of fe2 so4 3 or pac were added to the samples then the samples were rapidly mixed at 200 rpm for 5 min to promote coagulation and then mixed at 50 rpm for 20 min to promote flocculation the dosage of coagulants in the pre coagulation process was optimized through single factor experiments the detailed optimization process is presented in text sm 1 in the supplementary materials sm the pre coagulation supernatant was collected into the reservoir of the catalytic ozonation system for use in subsequent experiments ozonation experiments were carried out using a batch reactor 3 l water volume operated in a semi continuous mode with a constant flow 0 5 l min of an ozone oxygen gas mixture an ozone generator qingdao guolin environmental technology co ltd china was applied to produce o3 gas from pure o2 gas as described previously 48 an ozone concentration analyzer was used to measure the inlet gaseous o3 concentration 49 different ozone doses were obtained by adjusting the power of the ozone generator so that the mass ratio of ozone to cod during the 180 min experiment is 0 3 3 the ozone gas passes through the sand core aeration plate to enter the react column and the residual ozone exits from the top of the column to the ozone destruction device samples were taken every 30 min and na2so3 20 mm was injected to quench the residual ozone for later analysis similar operations are performed in the process of catalytic ozonation for the btcw with or without pre coagulation all experimental operations were carried out at room temperature 2 4 analytical and evaluation methods water quality was determined according to standard methods 50 chemical oxygen demand cod concentration of water samples was measured by hach cuvettes and a dr2800 spectrophotometer the toc concentration was measured with a toc analyzer toc l cph shimadzu japan and uv254 was measured using a uv vis detector uv 1700 shimadzu kyoto japan the gas phase o3 concentration at the gas inlet was monitored using an ozone analyzer uvoz 1200 200 mg l zhisong technology co china fluorescence analysis was carried out on btcw using a fluorescence spectroscope f 7000 hitachi japan organic matter fluorescence in btcw generated by scanning excitation wavelengths between 220 and 450 nm in 5 nm increments emitted fluorescence was detected at wavelengths between 280 and 600 nm at 1 nm intervals parallel factor analysis parafac was conducted in matlab 2018b following the instructions presented in the previous research 51 52 the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax was used to evaluate the relative content of the identified components for the consumption analysis of the treatment process the specific ozone consumption ds is calculated as a mass of ozone per mass of cod degraded ds can be expressed by the following eqs 1 and 2 1 d app 0 t q gas o 3 g dt v l 2 d s d app cod 0 cod t where dapp mg l and ds go3 gcod represent applied ozone dosage and specific ozone consumption respectively o3 g show the ozone concentration in the gas stream at the inlet as mg l qgas and vl represent gas flow rate l min and liquid volume l cod 0 and cod t are concentrations before oxidation and at any specific time respectively as mg l for the calculation of ds the ozone content at the outlet could be deducted 53 however since the exhaust gas is usually destroyed by the destruction device and is no longer reused for full scale application this study did not deduct the ozone concentration of the exhaust gas when calculating ds 3 results and discussion 3 1 cod removal by catalytic ozonation and degradation reaction kinetics the evolution of cod during the treatment of btcw shows that catalytic ozonation has a limited treatment effect on btcw fig 2 the cod removal is still less than 50 within the test time 180 min even if the ozone dosage reaches 2 7 go3 gcod and the effluent treated by catalytic ozonation does not meet the national discharge standards 80 mg l this phenomenon indicates that btcw contains substantial ozone resistant pollutants orsps besides fig 2b shows that the degradation of cod follows a pseudo first order kinetic model it is worth noting that with the increase of ozone concentration the degradation process of cod can be gradually divided into two reaction stages and the higher the ozone dosage the earlier the inflection point appears which is consistent with tay et al 54 indeed tay et al studied the degradation kinetics of parabens by ozone oxidation in an aqueous solution and found that the degradation process followed a pseudo first order kinetic model and two ozonation stages occurred the apparent reaction rate constant kapp of paraben during the first stage was smaller than that of the second stage as can be seen from fig 2b when the ozone dosage is 0 29 go3 gcod and 0 96 go3 gcod the kapp values are 1 6 10 3 min 1 and 2 5 10 3 min 1 respectively when the ozone dosage is 1 65 go3 gcod the kapp value is 4 5 10 3 min 1 at the first stage 0 90 min and 1 3 10 3 min 1 second stage 90 180 min correspondingly when the ozone dosage is 2 7 go3 gcod the kapp value is 8 10 3 min 1 at the first stage 0 60 min and 1 10 3 min 1 second stage 60 180 min obviously the kapp of cod in btcw during the first stage is much larger than that during the second stage when the ozone dosage is relatively high this phenomenon may be because the btcw contains many organic pollutants with different structures and their reaction rates with ozone and hydroxyl radicals vary greatly 32 33 when the concentration of ozone reactive pollutants oraps is high the degradation rate of cod could be maintained at a high level after most oraps are decomposed orsps will become the primary organic matter in the water matrix and their slow reaction rates with ozone lead to decreased cod degradation rate the degradation process of cod is not divided into two stages when the ozone dose is less than 0 96 go3 gcod fig 2b which may be due to the lower ozone dosage that cannot remove oraps sufficiently throughout the experiment hence there is no apparent downward trend in the rate of cod degradation at the second reaction stage in contrast when the ozone dosage reaches 1 65 go3 gcod the kapp value between the two stages is different the overall reaction rate of cod is significantly reduced during the second stage it can be inferred that the oraps in the water matrix is almost decomposed completely based on this inference it can be estimated that the minimum ozone demand for oraps in btcw is between 0 96 1 65 go3 gcod in comparison yang et al 55 found that the minimum ozone consumption of ozone reactive compounds in the leachate was 0 95 go3 gdoc during the process of ozonation furthermore it should be noted that as ozone dosage increases the kapp of cod rises continuously at the first reaction stage while declines at the second stage without considering the low ozone dosage which may be attributed to the changes in the composition of organic pollutants in btcw the more ozone is used the more complete oraps are oxidized resulting in fewer oraps that can react at the second stage meanwhile the increase of the ozone dosage can cause more ozone by products at the first reaction stage which are difficult to be further decomposed 56 the accumulation of ozone by products also results in the kapp of cod declining at the second stage generally catalytic ozone oxidation includes the direct reaction by molecular ozone with pollutants and the indirect reaction by hydroxyl radicals with contaminants meanwhile it is confirmed that the cod removal during the catalytic ozonation is attributed to the combined oxidation of ozone and hydroxyl radicals oh in our previous study 57 as well as the same results were reported in other paper 58 therefore the overall reaction rate of cod can be described by the second order kinetics in eq 3 3 ln cod 0 cod k o 3 o 3 dt k oh oh dt where ko3 and k oh are the overall reaction rate constants of pollutant reactions with molecular ozone and oh respectively cod o3 and oh are the concentrations of cod ozone and oh in the effluent respectively the ratio of oh to ozone during ozonation processes 59 is defined as rct and is expressed as the following 4 r ct oh dt o 3 dt substituting eq 4 into eq 3 results in 5 ln cod 0 cod k o 3 k oh r ct o 3 dt this study has confirmed that the degradation process of cod during catalytic ozonation follows the pseudo first order reaction kinetic model based on fig 2b therefore the kapp of cod can be expressed as the following 6 k app k o 3 r ct k oh o 3 eq 6 also theoretically explains that increasing the ozone dosage can enhance the kapp of cod because increasing the ozone dose in the gas phase will increase the difference in ozone concentration at the gas liquid interface which leads to an increase in the ozone concentration in the liquid phase 60 as a result more oraps are decomposed meanwhile the drastic kinetic limitation suffered at the second stage can also be explained by eq 6 it can be seen from fig 2b that when the applied ozone dosage is lower than the minimum ozone dose mod required by the water matrix 0 96 go3 gcod the depletion of ozone is mainly attributed to the degradation of oraps in contrast when the applied ozone dosage exceeds the mod i e the stage after 90 min at ozone dosage of 1 65 go3 gcod or the stage after 60 min at ozone dosage of 2 70 go3 gcod the degradation of oraps were almost completed with the degradation of oraps in the second reaction stage the reactivity of organic matter with ozone decreases the k oh value generally has little change due to the non selectivity of oh reacting with organic matter during the overall process 61 then the limitation of kapp could be caused by ko 3 decrease which means the orsps have become the primary pollutants at the second stage as such the ratio of oraps to orsps has a significant impact on the ozonation effect of coking wastewater in other words the ko3 may be affected by the change in this ratio 3 2 effect of pre coagulation on cod degradation reaction kinetics pre coagulation has been proven to positively affect the ozonation treatment of textile wastewater 62 63 however limited information is available for the influence of pre coagulation on the kinetics of ozonation of btcw this work studies the combination of pre coagulation and catalytic ozonation to treat btcw based on the results shown in fig 3a and fig 2a the degradation efficiency of cod is increased treated by pre coagulation combined catalytic ozonation at the equal ozone dosage the cod in btcw drops to 210 mg l after pre coagulation resulting in more than 34 removal efficiency moreover the cod removal for the coagulated btcw by catalytic ozonation reaches 69 while the removal without coagulation is only 45 at the equal o3 dosage meanwhile the effluent of coagulated btcw can meet the discharge standard after 180 min with o3 dose 1 65 go3 gcod of treatment with catalytic ozonation as shown in fig 3b the degradation performance of cod in btcw depended on the ozone dosage when the ozone dosage gradually increased from 1 65 to 3 00 go3 gcod the removal efficiency of cod at 180 min increases from 62 to 73 at higher ozone dosage the removal of cod is accomplished to a greater extent in terms of kinetics it is worth mentioning that the degradation of cod in coagulated btcw is no longer divided into two ozonation stages when the ozone dose is lower than 2 7 go3 gcod compared with btcw without pre coagulation this fact is because pre coagulation has effective removal performance for orsps 64 making the content of oraps account for a relatively high proportion throughout the catalytic ozonation these results also mentioned in the previous report that wastewater containing higher apparent molecular weight components exerted a greater ozone demand than other wastewaters containing a lower proportion of high apparent molecular weight components 65 however it should be emphasized that when the ozone dose reaches 3 00 go3 gcod the kinetic curve occurs at an inflection point after 120 min indicating that the pre coagulation process cannot wholly remove orsps it is also possible that a large amount of ozone resistant substances such as small molecular organic acids have accumulated after the decomposition of organic matter 3 3 effect of pre coagulation on ozone consumption the use of ozone will undoubtedly cause an increase in energy consumption in the process of wastewater treatment as such for full scale application the ozone dosage is an essential operating parameter that directly affects the cost of wastewater treatment 66 since the ozone dosage of less than 0 96 go3 gcod does not reach the minimum ozone demand only the case where the ozone dosage is more significant than 0 96 go3 gcod is considered when evaluating the specific ozone consumption fig 4a exhibits the changes of the ds value of the two ozone dosages with and without coagulation with the reaction time the ds value gradually increases with time indicating that the ozone consumption per unit mass of cod gradually increases as the reaction progresses which is closely related to the composition and reactivity of organic matters during the reaction the ds value is stable at about 2 0 go3 gcod for the first 30 min regardless of the coagulation pretreatment and ozone amount which means almost all the applied ozone participates in the decomposition reaction of organic matter as such the first 30 min can be regarded as the ozone sufficient utilization stage throughout the reaction period the ds values of btcw without coagulation are 4 3 go3 gcod with 1 65 go3 gcod ozone dose and 5 8 go3 gcod with 2 7 go3 gcod ozone dose correspondingly under a similar ozone dose the ds values of pre coagulated btcw are 2 6 go3 gcod and 4 2 go3 gcod respectively as a result pre coagulation coupled with the catalytic ozonation process can effectively reduce the ozone consumption per unit mass of cod when the ozone dosage is 1 65 go3 gcod and 2 7 go3 gcod the consumption of ozone by organic matter is reduced by 39 5 and 27 6 respectively to show the effect of pre coagulation on ozone consumption fig 4b depicts the plot that specific ozone consumption increases as ozone dose with or without pre coagulation all data with or without pre coagulation are each assembled into a single curve respectively indicating that ozone consumption increases linearly with ozone dosage regardless of pre coagulation interestingly the two curves intersect at the position where the ozone dose is 0 6 go3 gcod where the ozone consumption is 2 0 go3 gcod which happens to the ozone sufficient utilization stage described above after this stage the advantages of pre coagulation to reduce ozone consumption have gradually become prominent the fact that the slope of the samples with pre coagulation is much smaller than those without pre coagulation indicates that pre coagulation can significantly reduce ozone consumption considering the two stage phenomenon of cod degradation in the ozonation process table 1 lists the comparative data of ozone consumption with or without pre coagulation in the first stage of the reaction there is no significant difference in the ozone consumption per unit mass of cod regardless of whether there is coagulation pretreatment the benefits of pre coagulation are obvious in the second stage of catalytic ozonation compared with btcw without pre coagulation the ozone consumption of btcw with pre coagulation in the second stage of ozonation decreased by 78 2 ozone dosage 1 65 go3 gcod and 72 0 ozone dosage 2 7 go3 gcod respectively as such the impact of coagulation pretreatment on ozone consumption is mainly reflected in the second stage of the ozonation process additionally the high ozone consumption in the second stage has remarkably increased the cost of btcw treatment by the catalytic ozonation process it is recommended to couple with an appropriate coagulation treatment for pretreatment of btcw 3 4 changes of fluorescence components of coking wastewater the eem data set of the btcw sample is decomposed into five fluorescence components fig 5 and table s1 through the parafac model they are identified as tryptophan and protein like c1 humic or fulvic acid like compounds c2 aromatic protein c3 large molecular size hydrophobic humic like compounds c4 and soluble microbial by product like compounds c5 based on previous literature 67 68 these fluorescent substances with peaks at different excitation emission wavelengths exhibit different hydrophobicity 69 these characteristics provide a supplementary explanation for the effect of pre coagulation on the btcw treated by catalytic ozonation according to liu et al 70 the c1 and c2 components are mostly hydrophilic substances the aromatic proteins of the c3 component are mostly hydrophobic neutral substances while the c4 and c5 components contain both hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances fig 6 displays the changes of the fluorescent components during the coagulation and catalytic ozonation process it s observed that the fmax of c1 and c2 components hardly decreased after pre coagulation in sharp contrast the ozonation process caused 79 and 82 reductions in c1 and c2 respectively the contents of c4 and c5 subjected to pre coagulation are eliminated by 30 and 40 respectively subsequently ozonation made their removal effect reached more than 90 the most noteworthy thing is that the c3 component as a hydrophobic substance is almost entirely removed by the coagulation process these results indicate that coagulation could preferentially remove hydrophobic macromolecular substances which dramatically reduces ozone consumption similar research results have also been reported in the previous literature 71 that is coagulation does have a good elimination effect on hydrophobic substances especially in wastewater with a relatively high hydrophobic substance content 3 5 the performance of the pilot scale system the pilot scale test was carried out at the ozone dosage of 1 2 go3 gcod for 350 l wastewater and the coking wastewater with or without coagulation pretreatment was subjected to a catalytic ozonation process fig s3 shows a picture of the actual device and the treatment results are shown in fig s4 and the relevant ozone consumption information is summarized in table 2 the effluent from the catalytic ozonation system with coagulation pretreatment meets emission standards however it cannot reach the discharge standard even with longer processing if not pretreated by coagulation for the comparison of ds the ds values in the first stage were roughly equal regardless of pre coagulation or not in the second stage the ds value of the samples without pre coagulation was about two times higher than that with pre coagulation this indicates that coagulation pretreatment can significantly enhance the efficiency of ozone the reusability of catalysts is an important indicator to measure the performance of catalysts fig s5 depicts comparison images of sem for the fresh catalyst and used catalyst 7 days it can be seen that when the catalyst was immersed in coking wastewater without ozone a large number of nano sized particles accumulated on the surface of the catalyst due to adsorption and the micropores of the catalyst disappeared however after undergoing ozonation the morphology of the used catalyst was similar to that of the fresh catalyst the micropores of the catalyst still exist after being used for a while in addition our previous research 57 showed that this type of catalyst could be used for at least 1 year in a reactor equipped with a backflushing facility see from fig s6 in addition to the coking wastewater also petrochemical wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate and textile wastewater has been investigated to be treated by catalytic ozonation table sm 2 summarized the pollutant removal efficiency for the catalytic ozonation as reported in the literature from different wastewater during the catalytic ozonation treatment of wastewater the removal efficiency of cod ranged from 25 to 70 and the removal efficiency of toc was between 40 and 88 the difference in pollutant removal efficiency was mainly related to the contaminant content and composition of the wastewater matrix 4 conclusions catalytic ozonation has a limited effect on the removal of organic matter in btcw it can only eliminate 45 of cod in btcw which cannot meet corresponding national discharge standards moreover the degradation process of cod is divided into two stages during the catalytic ozonation the slow degradation rate of the second stage seriously affects the overall effect because the increasing proportion of orsps inhibits the ozonation reaction the combination of pre coagulation and catalytic ozonation is significantly beneficial for reducing the cod content in btcw because pre coagulation can remove most of orsps the combined process increases cod removal in btcw from 45 to 69 and the second stage slow reaction process no longer occurs the specific ozone consumption increases linearly with the ozone dosage regardless of whether btcw is subjected to pre coagulation the benefits of pre coagulation are mainly reflected in the second stage of ozonation the ozone consumption per unit mass of cod at the second stage reached 24 3 go3 gcod without pre coagulation while that is only 6 8 go3 gcod with pre coagulation this combination is a suitable method

12952,the ozone based advanced oxidation process in wastewater effluent degrades refractory organics efficiently and significantly nevertheless high energy consumption is a challenge that hinders its widespread application in this work the pre coagulation enhanced catalytic ozonation process for the treatment of biologically treated coking wastewater btcw was investigated the chemical oxygen demand cod removal results indicated that catalytic ozonation has an inadequate removal effect on the organic pollutants in btcw moreover the two stage degradation occurred in the cod ozonation process of which the slow reaction rate in the second stage was the main reason that limited its overall effect the pre coagulation overcame the obstacle of the limited effect of catalytic ozonation treatment of btcw because of its ability to remove hydrophobic organics the combination of pre coagulation with catalytic ozonation could increase the cod removal efficiency from 45 to 69 compared with catalytic ozonation alone there was a linear relationship between specific ozone consumption and ozone dosage regardless of whether btcw was subjected to pre coagulation the fact that the slope of this linear relationship with pre coagulation was much smaller than that without pre coagulation it indicates that pre coagulation could significantly reduce ozone consumption the primary role of pre coagulation was to reduce ozone consumption considerably in the second stage of the ozonation process the ozone consumption per unit mass of cod in the second stage reached 24 3 go3 gcod without pre coagulation while that was only 6 8 go3 gcod with pre coagulation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords coking wastewater catalytic ozonation pre coagulation kinetic model consumption analysis 1 introduction coking wastewater is complex industrial wastewater produced by coking plants it is generated by coke quenching and coking gas purification during the coking process 1 the components of coking wastewater are extraordinarily complex and are rich in refractory organic compounds including phenols polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and cyanides 2 the traditional treatment technology of coking wastewater mainly uses biological treatment because of its low cost and a high degree of pollutants mineralization anoxic aerobic a o or anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2 o processes are the main processes for coking wastewater treatment in china 3 5 however due to the presence of a large number of refractory and inhibitory pollutants the biologically treated coking wastewater btcw still contains a relatively high concentration of non biodegradable organic pollutants 6 8 as refractory pollutants in coking wastewater receive more attention china has strengthened the national discharge standards for coking wastewater 9 making btcw unable to satisfy the discharge standards as a result the advanced treatment technology of coking wastewater is becoming increasingly important currently various technologies have been proposed for the advanced treatment of btcw such as advanced oxidation processes aops adsorption technologies and membrane filtrations ozone is a strong oxidant with electrophilic properties and it reacts rapidly with electron rich groups 10 besides hydroxyl radicals oh which are secondary oxidants produced by ozone s self decomposition contribute significantly to removing organic compounds without electron rich groups 11 furthermore the catalytic ozonation process uses catalysts to promote the decomposition of ozone which increases the oh generation 12 thereby improving the efficiency of removing pollutants consequently as one of the aops the catalytic ozonation process has received growing attention in wastewater treatment due to its capacity for degradation and mineralization pollutants especially in removing refractory organic substances 13 the catalytic ozonation process can effectively eliminate micro pollutants e g pharmaceutical 14 18 and pesticides 19 22 in the secondary effluent of municipal sewage or drinking water sources and reduce the toxicity of these micro pollutants through degradation or mineralization catalytic ozonation also plays an essential role in the tertiary treatment of many types of industrial wastewater e g petrochemical wastewater 23 27 coal chemical wastewater 28 29 and dye wastewater 13 30 however even though many studies have confirmed that catalytic ozonation in wastewater effluent degrades refractory organics efficiently and significantly challenges need to be solved that hamper wide application one of the main limitations of catalytic ozonation treatment for industrial wastewater is that this process increases the treatment costs 31 additionally many different organic pollutants with various chemical structures are present in wastewater effluent 32 and their reaction rates with ozone and hydroxyl radicals vary considerably 33 on top of that the effluent matrix of different industries varies greatly the overall removal of organic pollutants varies depending on the pollutant composition and concentration in the wastewater matrix during the tertiary treatment process with catalytic ozonation ozone reactive pollutants oraps with electron rich moieties erms can be more efficiently eliminated than ozone resistant pollutants orsps without erms due to the combined reaction with ozone and oh 34 organic contaminants in the water matrix can be divided into oraps and orsps when the high content of orsps is present in the wastewater matrix the polluted water is difficult to purify by ozonation because of the low reactivity of orsps with ozone as such understanding the kinetic elimination characteristics of organic pollutants in the process of catalytic ozonation has become a crucial matter which contributes to the analysis of influencing factors during the advanced treatment of btcw by catalytic ozonation it also can promote the development of effective methods to eliminate pollutants furthermore as the catalytic ozonation process is an energy consuming method 13 it is necessary to consider the ozone demand and associated energy requirements when increasing the degradation rate of organic pollutants the coagulation process is a crucial treatment technology with a wide range of applications in advanced water and wastewater treatment facilities 35 36 pre coagulation provides a treatment alternative to removing pollutants before an ozonation process pre coagulation with different kinds of aluminum salts and iron salts has become a typical wastewater treatment process to remove particles nutrients and organic pollutants studies have shown that pre coagulation preferentially removes dissolved organic matter dom with higher molecular weight 37 39 the pre coagulation process has been widely used in the treatment of various types of industrial wastewater such as dye textile wastewater 40 food processing industry wastewater 41 43 pulp and paper wastewater 44 46 etc the coagulation mechanism includes neutralizing the charge of negatively charged organics by hydrated oxide metal cations and by adsorption and entrapment of dom onto the surface of the sediment of insoluble metal hydrated oxide 47 therefore pre coagulation may have effects on the rate of subsequent catalytic ozonation however to the best of our knowledge there are few reports on the effect of pre coagulation on the degradation kinetics of organic pollutants in btcw and the ozone consumption during catalytic ozonation in the present study the principal objectives are therefore i to understand the kinetics of organic pollutants degradation during btcw treatment by applying catalytic ozonation with aluminum based catalysts and analyze the factors affecting the degradation rate from the perspective of kinetics ii to investigate the abatement of organic pollutants during btcw treatment by applying catalytic ozonation combined with pre coagulation and iii to propose feasible methods to promote catalytic ozonation efficiency considering pollutants elimination rate and treatment cost 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater samples the actual btcw samples were obtained from the secondary sedimentation tank of a two stage a o process of a coal chemical factory in the inner mongolia of northwest china the basic quality of the biologically treated coking wastewater btcw is as follows chemical oxygen demand cod 280 320 mg l dissolved organic carbon doc 78 83 mg l

study fig 1 the ozonation reactor is a cylindrical glass reactor with a diameter of 6 cm and a height of 180 cm the reactor has four sampling ports numbered 1 4 from bottom to top sampling ports 1 and 4 are connected by a peristaltic pump bt100 2 j shenchen pump co ltd china to thoroughly mix the wastewater and ozone the reactor is filled with 25 35 volume of aluminum based commercial catalyst made of alumina pellets covered with cerium and manganese oxides shuimengyuan technology co china an oxygen source ozone generator tonglin technology co china 2 g h was used to supply the ozone for the experiments an ozone concentration analyzer was used to monitor the ozone concentration take a sample at a specific time from sampling port 3 and test its cod concentration 2 3 experimental procedure pre coagulation experiments were performed using a six paddle agitation device meiyu environmental equipment co china during the pre coagulation analytical grades of polyaluminum chloride pac and fe2 so4 3 were used as coagulants which were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd the coagulant stock solution was prepared to a concentration of 20 g l for subsequent experiments the coagulation experiments were conducted in 1 l beakers at room temperature the different concentrations of fe2 so4 3 or pac were added to the samples then the samples were rapidly mixed at 200 rpm for 5 min to promote coagulation and then mixed at 50 rpm for 20 min to promote flocculation the dosage of coagulants in the pre coagulation process was optimized through single factor experiments the detailed optimization process is presented in text sm 1 in the supplementary materials sm the pre coagulation supernatant was collected into the reservoir of the catalytic ozonation system for use in subsequent experiments ozonation experiments were carried out using a batch reactor 3 l water volume operated in a semi continuous mode with a constant flow 0 5 l min of an ozone oxygen gas mixture an ozone generator qingdao guolin environmental technology co ltd china was applied to produce o3 gas from pure o2 gas as described previously 48 an ozone concentration analyzer was used to measure the inlet gaseous o3 concentration 49 different ozone doses were obtained by adjusting the power of the ozone generator so that the mass ratio of ozone to cod during the 180 min experiment is 0 3 3 the ozone gas passes through the sand core aeration plate to enter the react column and the residual ozone exits from the top of the column to the ozone destruction device samples were taken every 30 min and na2so3 20 mm was injected to quench the residual ozone for later analysis similar operations are performed in the process of catalytic ozonation for the btcw with or without pre coagulation all experimental operations were carried out at room temperature 2 4 analytical and evaluation methods water quality was determined according to standard methods 50 chemical oxygen demand cod concentration of water samples was measured by hach cuvettes and a dr2800 spectrophotometer the toc concentration was measured with a toc analyzer toc l cph shimadzu japan and uv254 was measured using a uv vis detector uv 1700 shimadzu kyoto japan the gas phase o3 concentration at the gas inlet was monitored using an ozone analyzer uvoz 1200 200 mg l zhisong technology co china fluorescence analysis was carried out on btcw using a fluorescence spectroscope f 7000 hitachi japan organic matter fluorescence in btcw generated by scanning excitation wavelengths between 220 and 450 nm in 5 nm increments emitted fluorescence was detected at wavelengths between 280 and 600 nm at 1 nm intervals parallel factor analysis parafac was conducted in matlab 2018b following the instructions presented in the previous research 51 52 the maximum fluorescence intensity fmax was used to evaluate the relative content of the identified components for the consumption analysis of the treatment process the specific ozone consumption ds is calculated as a mass of ozone per mass of cod degraded ds can be expressed by the following eqs 1 and 2 1 d app 0 t q gas o 3 g dt v l 2 d s d app cod 0 cod t where dapp mg l and ds go3 gcod represent applied ozone dosage and specific ozone consumption respectively o3 g show the ozone concentration in the gas stream at the inlet as mg l qgas and vl represent gas flow rate l min and liquid volume l cod 0 and cod t are concentrations before oxidation and at any specific time respectively as mg l for the calculation of ds the ozone content at the outlet could be deducted 53 however since the exhaust gas is usually destroyed by the destruction device and is no longer reused for full scale application this study did not deduct the ozone concentration of the exhaust gas when calculating ds 3 results and discussion 3 1 cod removal by catalytic ozonation and degradation reaction kinetics the evolution of cod during the treatment of btcw shows that catalytic ozonation has a limited treatment effect on btcw fig 2 the cod removal is still less than 50 within the test time 180 min even if the ozone dosage reaches 2 7 go3 gcod and the effluent treated by catalytic ozonation does not meet the national discharge standards 80 mg l this phenomenon indicates that btcw contains substantial ozone resistant pollutants orsps besides fig 2b shows that the degradation of cod follows a pseudo first order kinetic model it is worth noting that with the increase of ozone concentration the degradation process of cod can be gradually divided into two reaction stages and the higher the ozone dosage the earlier the inflection point appears which is consistent with tay et al 54 indeed tay et al studied the degradation kinetics of parabens by ozone oxidation in an aqueous solution and found that the degradation process followed a pseudo first order kinetic model and two ozonation stages occurred the apparent reaction rate constant kapp of paraben during the first stage was smaller than that of the second stage as can be seen from fig 2b when the ozone dosage is 0 29 go3 gcod and 0 96 go3 gcod the kapp values are 1 6 10 3 min 1 and 2 5 10 3 min 1 respectively when the ozone dosage is 1 65 go3 gcod the kapp value is 4 5 10 3 min 1 at the first stage 0 90 min and 1 3 10 3 min 1 second stage 90 180 min correspondingly when the ozone dosage is 2 7 go3 gcod the kapp value is 8 10 3 min 1 at the first stage 0 60 min and 1 10 3 min 1 second stage 60 180 min obviously the kapp of cod in btcw during the first stage is much larger than that during the second stage when the ozone dosage is relatively high this phenomenon may be because the btcw contains many organic pollutants with different structures and their reaction rates with ozone and hydroxyl radicals vary greatly 32 33 when the concentration of ozone reactive pollutants oraps is high the degradation rate of cod could be maintained at a high level after most oraps are decomposed orsps will become the primary organic matter in the water matrix and their slow reaction rates with ozone lead to decreased cod degradation rate the degradation process of cod is not divided into two stages when the ozone dose is less than 0 96 go3 gcod fig 2b which may be due to the lower ozone dosage that cannot remove oraps sufficiently throughout the experiment hence there is no apparent downward trend in the rate of cod degradation at the second reaction stage in contrast when the ozone dosage reaches 1 65 go3 gcod the kapp value between the two stages is different the overall reaction rate of cod is significantly reduced during the second stage it can be inferred that the oraps in the water matrix is almost decomposed completely based on this inference it can be estimated that the minimum ozone demand for oraps in btcw is between 0 96 1 65 go3 gcod in comparison yang et al 55 found that the minimum ozone consumption of ozone reactive compounds in the leachate was 0 95 go3 gdoc during the process of ozonation furthermore it should be noted that as ozone dosage increases the kapp of cod rises continuously at the first reaction stage while declines at the second stage without considering the low ozone dosage which may be attributed to the changes in the composition of organic pollutants in btcw the more ozone is used the more complete oraps are oxidized resulting in fewer oraps that can react at the second stage meanwhile the increase of the ozone dosage can cause more ozone by products at the first reaction stage which are difficult to be further decomposed 56 the accumulation of ozone by products also results in the kapp of cod declining at the second stage generally catalytic ozone oxidation includes the direct reaction by molecular ozone with pollutants and the indirect reaction by hydroxyl radicals with contaminants meanwhile it is confirmed that the cod removal during the catalytic ozonation is attributed to the combined oxidation of ozone and hydroxyl radicals oh in our previous study 57 as well as the same results were reported in other paper 58 therefore the overall reaction rate of cod can be described by the second order kinetics in eq 3 3 ln cod 0 cod k o 3 o 3 dt k oh oh dt where ko3 and k oh are the overall reaction rate constants of pollutant reactions with molecular ozone and oh respectively cod o3 and oh are the concentrations of cod ozone and oh in the effluent respectively the ratio of oh to ozone during ozonation processes 59 is defined as rct and is expressed as the following 4 r ct oh dt o 3 dt substituting eq 4 into eq 3 results in 5 ln cod 0 cod k o 3 k oh r ct o 3 dt this study has confirmed that the degradation process of cod during catalytic ozonation follows the pseudo first order reaction kinetic model based on fig 2b therefore the kapp of cod can be expressed as the following 6 k app k o 3 r ct k oh o 3 eq 6 also theoretically explains that increasing the ozone dosage can enhance the kapp of cod because increasing the ozone dose in the gas phase will increase the difference in ozone concentration at the gas liquid interface which leads to an increase in the ozone concentration in the liquid phase 60 as a result more oraps are decomposed meanwhile the drastic kinetic limitation suffered at the second stage can also be explained by eq 6 it can be seen from fig 2b that when the applied ozone dosage is lower than the minimum ozone dose mod required by the water matrix 0 96 go3 gcod the depletion of ozone is mainly attributed to the degradation of oraps in contrast when the applied ozone dosage exceeds the mod i e the stage after 90 min at ozone dosage of 1 65 go3 gcod or the stage after 60 min at ozone dosage of 2 70 go3 gcod the degradation of oraps were almost completed with the degradation of oraps in the second reaction stage the reactivity of organic matter with ozone decreases the k oh value generally has little change due to the non selectivity of oh reacting with organic matter during the overall process 61 then the limitation of kapp could be caused by ko 3 decrease which means the orsps have become the primary pollutants at the second stage as such the ratio of oraps to orsps has a significant impact on the ozonation effect of coking wastewater in other words the ko3 may be affected by the change in this ratio 3 2 effect of pre coagulation on cod degradation reaction kinetics pre coagulation has been proven to positively affect the ozonation treatment of textile wastewater 62 63 however limited information is available for the influence of pre coagulation on the kinetics of ozonation of btcw this work studies the combination of pre coagulation and catalytic ozonation to treat btcw based on the results shown in fig 3a and fig 2a the degradation efficiency of cod is increased treated by pre coagulation combined catalytic ozonation at the equal ozone dosage the cod in btcw drops to 210 mg l after pre coagulation resulting in more than 34 removal efficiency moreover the cod removal for the coagulated btcw by catalytic ozonation reaches 69 while the removal without coagulation is only 45 at the equal o3 dosage meanwhile the effluent of coagulated btcw can meet the discharge standard after 180 min with o3 dose 1 65 go3 gcod of treatment with catalytic ozonation as shown in fig 3b the degradation performance of cod in btcw depended on the ozone dosage when the ozone dosage gradually increased from 1 65 to 3 00 go3 gcod the removal efficiency of cod at 180 min increases from 62 to 73 at higher ozone dosage the removal of cod is accomplished to a greater extent in terms of kinetics it is worth mentioning that the degradation of cod in coagulated btcw is no longer divided into two ozonation stages when the ozone dose is lower than 2 7 go3 gcod compared with btcw without pre coagulation this fact is because pre coagulation has effective removal performance for orsps 64 making the content of oraps account for a relatively high proportion throughout the catalytic ozonation these results also mentioned in the previous report that wastewater containing higher apparent molecular weight components exerted a greater ozone demand than other wastewaters containing a lower proportion of high apparent molecular weight components 65 however it should be emphasized that when the ozone dose reaches 3 00 go3 gcod the kinetic curve occurs at an inflection point after 120 min indicating that the pre coagulation process cannot wholly remove orsps it is also possible that a large amount of ozone resistant substances such as small molecular organic acids have accumulated after the decomposition of organic matter 3 3 effect of pre coagulation on ozone consumption the use of ozone will undoubtedly cause an increase in energy consumption in the process of wastewater treatment as such for full scale application the ozone dosage is an essential operating parameter that directly affects the cost of wastewater treatment 66 since the ozone dosage of less than 0 96 go3 gcod does not reach the minimum ozone demand only the case where the ozone dosage is more significant than 0 96 go3 gcod is considered when evaluating the specific ozone consumption fig 4a exhibits the changes of the ds value of the two ozone dosages with and without coagulation with the reaction time the ds value gradually increases with time indicating that the ozone consumption per unit mass of cod gradually increases as the reaction progresses which is closely related to the composition and reactivity of organic matters during the reaction the ds value is stable at about 2 0 go3 gcod for the first 30 min regardless of the coagulation pretreatment and ozone amount which means almost all the applied ozone participates in the decomposition reaction of organic matter as such the first 30 min can be regarded as the ozone sufficient utilization stage throughout the reaction period the ds values of btcw without coagulation are 4 3 go3 gcod with 1 65 go3 gcod ozone dose and 5 8 go3 gcod with 2 7 go3 gcod ozone dose correspondingly under a similar ozone dose the ds values of pre coagulated btcw are 2 6 go3 gcod and 4 2 go3 gcod respectively as a result pre coagulation coupled with the catalytic ozonation process can effectively reduce the ozone consumption per unit mass of cod when the ozone dosage is 1 65 go3 gcod and 2 7 go3 gcod the consumption of ozone by organic matter is reduced by 39 5 and 27 6 respectively to show the effect of pre coagulation on ozone consumption fig 4b depicts the plot that specific ozone consumption increases as ozone dose with or without pre coagulation all data with or without pre coagulation are each assembled into a single curve respectively indicating that ozone consumption increases linearly with ozone dosage regardless of pre coagulation interestingly the two curves intersect at the position where the ozone dose is 0 6 go3 gcod where the ozone consumption is 2 0 go3 gcod which happens to the ozone sufficient utilization stage described above after this stage the advantages of pre coagulation to reduce ozone consumption have gradually become prominent the fact that the slope of the samples with pre coagulation is much smaller than those without pre coagulation indicates that pre coagulation can significantly reduce ozone consumption considering the two stage phenomenon of cod degradation in the ozonation process table 1 lists the comparative data of ozone consumption with or without pre coagulation in the first stage of the reaction there is no significant difference in the ozone consumption per unit mass of cod regardless of whether there is coagulation pretreatment the benefits of pre coagulation are obvious in the second stage of catalytic ozonation compared with btcw without pre coagulation the ozone consumption of btcw with pre coagulation in the second stage of ozonation decreased by 78 2 ozone dosage 1 65 go3 gcod and 72 0 ozone dosage 2 7 go3 gcod respectively as such the impact of coagulation pretreatment on ozone consumption is mainly reflected in the second stage of the ozonation process additionally the high ozone consumption in the second stage has remarkably increased the cost of btcw treatment by the catalytic ozonation process it is recommended to couple with an appropriate coagulation treatment for pretreatment of btcw 3 4 changes of fluorescence components of coking wastewater the eem data set of the btcw sample is decomposed into five fluorescence components fig 5 and table s1 through the parafac model they are identified as tryptophan and protein like c1 humic or fulvic acid like compounds c2 aromatic protein c3 large molecular size hydrophobic humic like compounds c4 and soluble microbial by product like compounds c5 based on previous literature 67 68 these fluorescent substances with peaks at different excitation emission wavelengths exhibit different hydrophobicity 69 these characteristics provide a supplementary explanation for the effect of pre coagulation on the btcw treated by catalytic ozonation according to liu et al 70 the c1 and c2 components are mostly hydrophilic substances the aromatic proteins of the c3 component are mostly hydrophobic neutral substances while the c4 and c5 components contain both hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances fig 6 displays the changes of the fluorescent components during the coagulation and catalytic ozonation process it s observed that the fmax of c1 and c2 components hardly decreased after pre coagulation in sharp contrast the ozonation process caused 79 and 82 reductions in c1 and c2 respectively the contents of c4 and c5 subjected to pre coagulation are eliminated by 30 and 40 respectively subsequently ozonation made their removal effect reached more than 90 the most noteworthy thing is that the c3 component as a hydrophobic substance is almost entirely removed by the coagulation process these results indicate that coagulation could preferentially remove hydrophobic macromolecular substances which dramatically reduces ozone consumption similar research results have also been reported in the previous literature 71 that is coagulation does have a good elimination effect on hydrophobic substances especially in wastewater with a relatively high hydrophobic substance content 3 5 the performance of the pilot scale system the pilot scale test was carried out at the ozone dosage of 1 2 go3 gcod for 350 l wastewater and the coking wastewater with or without coagulation pretreatment was subjected to a catalytic ozonation process fig s3 shows a picture of the actual device and the treatment results are shown in fig s4 and the relevant ozone consumption information is summarized in table 2 the effluent from the catalytic ozonation system with coagulation pretreatment meets emission standards however it cannot reach the discharge standard even with longer processing if not pretreated by coagulation for the comparison of ds the ds values in the first stage were roughly equal regardless of pre coagulation or not in the second stage the ds value of the samples without pre coagulation was about two times higher than that with pre coagulation this indicates that coagulation pretreatment can significantly enhance the efficiency of ozone the reusability of catalysts is an important indicator to measure the performance of catalysts fig s5 depicts comparison images of sem for the fresh catalyst and used catalyst 7 days it can be seen that when the catalyst was immersed in coking wastewater without ozone a large number of nano sized particles accumulated on the surface of the catalyst due to adsorption and the micropores of the catalyst disappeared however after undergoing ozonation the morphology of the used catalyst was similar to that of the fresh catalyst the micropores of the catalyst still exist after being used for a while in addition our previous research 57 showed that this type of catalyst could be used for at least 1 year in a reactor equipped with a backflushing facility see from fig s6 in addition to the coking wastewater also petrochemical wastewater reverse osmosis concentrate and textile wastewater has been investigated to be treated by catalytic ozonation table sm 2 summarized the pollutant removal efficiency for the catalytic ozonation as reported in the literature from different wastewater during the catalytic ozonation treatment of wastewater the removal efficiency of cod ranged from 25 to 70 and the removal efficiency of toc was between 40 and 88 the difference in pollutant removal efficiency was mainly related to the contaminant content and composition of the wastewater matrix 4 conclusions catalytic ozonation has a limited effect on the removal of organic matter in btcw it can only eliminate 45 of cod in btcw which cannot meet corresponding national discharge standards moreover the degradation process of cod is divided into two stages during the catalytic ozonation the slow degradation rate of the second stage seriously affects the overall effect because the increasing proportion of orsps inhibits the ozonation reaction the combination of pre coagulation and catalytic ozonation is significantly beneficial for reducing the cod content in btcw because pre coagulation can remove most of orsps the combined process increases cod removal in btcw from 45 to 69 and the second stage slow reaction process no longer occurs the specific ozone consumption increases linearly with the ozone dosage regardless of whether btcw is subjected to pre coagulation the benefits of pre coagulation are mainly reflected in the second stage of ozonation the ozone consumption per unit mass of cod at the second stage reached 24 3 go3 gcod without pre coagulation while that is only 6 8 go3 gcod with pre coagulation this combination is a suitable method for the advanced treatment of btcw containing multiple pollutants with diverse structures and a wide range of ozone reactivity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

12953,in this study a functionalized cellulose based monolith was utilized as a highly efficient adsorbent to remove heavy metal ions firstly cellulose based monolith ce monolith was obtained via combination of thermally induced phase separation and post alkaline hydrolysis afterwards the functionalized monolith edta ce monolith was prepared through esterification with ethylenediaminetetraacetic dianhydride the fabricated edta ce monolith showed a hierarchically porous morphology containing macro and mesopores simultaneously with an excellent compressive strength which was extremely suitable for heavy metal removal the porous structure and chemical properties of ce monolith and edta ce monolith were characterized through sem n2 adsorption desorption isotherm ft ir elementary analysis eds and xps finally the batch and fixed bed column experiments were performed to evaluate the adsorption behaviors of edta ce monolith for cd2 the results revealed that edta ce monolith exhibited a relatively fast cd2 adsorption rate with a maximum adsorption capacity of 110 1 mg g and edta ce monolith could be regenerated easily and displayed excellent reusability without significant loss of absorption capacity the fixed bed column adsorption implied that edta ce monolith showed high efficiency for cd2 adsorption therefore the edta ce monolith fabricated in this work had large potential to be used as an efficient adsorbent for the removal of heavy metal ions in wastewater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords cellulose based monolith hierarchically porous structure efficient adsorbent cadmium ii ion wastewater treatment 1 introduction rapid expansion of global industry has led to a series of serious environmental pollutions particularly heavy metal ions in industrial wastewater pose a great threat to both ecosystem and human life due to their huge harmfulness most of the heavy metal ions could not be decomposed naturally and thus accumulate in the water circulation and soil resulting in an enrichment in agricultural products and then transfer to human bodies because heavy metal ions cannot be completely metabolized they could cause severe damage to human health 1 5 cadmium ii cd2 is one of the typical toxic heavy metal ions which could store easily in certain organs and therefore cause lung insufficiency chronic renal disease liver dysfunctions as well as skeleton damage in addition it has been categorized as a carcinogen to human being by international agency for research on cancer 6 9 so far there are various methods that have been developed to deal with the heavy metal removal including chemical precipitation 10 11 membrane filtration 12 14 ion exchange 15 16 and electrochemical treatment 17 18 among them adsorption is regarded as one of the most promising technologies because of the simple procedure high removal efficiency low cost and without any secondary pollution 19 21 for adsorption technology adsorbent is the crucial factor and the most commonly used adsorbents are zeolites 22 modified clays 23 24 metal oxides 25 27 carbon nanotubes 28 29 metal organic frameworks 30 31 and certain polymer based materials 32 33 whereas most of them always suffered from low adsorption efficiency capacity slow adsorption rate high cost poor stability and reusability as well as complicated fabrication process therefore an efficient eco friendly economic and facile fabricated adsorbent for the removal of heavy metal ions is urgently required for adsorption technology monolith is a newly emerging material possessing a three dimensional open cellular interconnected porous morphology which is constructed in one single piece 34 39 due to these unique structural features monolith is considered to be an ideal adsorbent for heavy metal removal from industrial wastewater to be specific the inner flow through porous structure is favorable for highly efficient adsorption the structural integrity offers monolith simple operation without any secondary pollution and the excellent dimensional stability and mechanical strength guarantee the reusability of the material cellulose is the most abundant existing organic compound in nature and has been widely applied in numerous fields owing to its low price it is a kind of naturally derived polymer composed of a linear chain of d glucose units linked by β 1 4 glycosidic bonds 40 42 the presence of a large number of hydroxyl groups located in the chemical structure of cellulose molecule afford it high hydrophilicity and the facility to be modified into a variety of functionalities combined with the low production cost and excellent biocompatibility as well as strong chemical and thermal stability cellulose was employed as the starting material to fabricate monolith to efficiently remove heavy metal ions in this study in our previous work cellulose based monolith ce monolith with a hierarchically porous morphology was successfully obtained through thermally induced phase separation tips of cellulose acetate monolith combined with subsequent alkaline hydrolysis 43 tips is a novel technology for the monolith fabrication that uses polymer itself as a precursor compared to conventional fabrication techniques such as polymerization process tips is a kind of simple rapid and energy saving approach which could modulate the inner porous morphology easily additionally the monolith shape can be tuned conveniently through altering the form of the container 44 50 here tips technology was particularly suitable for fabricating ce monolith because cellulose was a naturally derived polymer without any available monomer in this study we successfully constructed a highly efficient adsorbent for the removal of heavy metal ions i e a functionalized ce monolith edta ce monolith with a hierarchically porous structure in the production process ce monolith was firstly fabricated through tips and post

including preparation of cellulose acetate monolith ca monolith through tips method and subsequent alkaline hydrolysis 43 typically cellulose acetate was dissolved in dmf 200 mg ml at room temperature and then heated to 75 c after addition of ha 15 ml the mixture was stirred for an additional 12 h and placed at 20 c to induce phase separation after 24 h ca monolith was prepared through solvent replacement by etoh and drying in vacuo subsequently ca monolith was immersed in a naoh solution in meoh 0 15 m and stirred at 30 c for 3 h to complete the alkaline hydrolysis after neutralizing with hcl and washing by h2o and meoh ce monolith was obtained through drying under vacuum at 50 c 2 4 modification of ce monolith ce monolith was modified through esterification reaction of its hydroxyl groups with edtad fig 1 the specific process was described as follows 353 9 mg 1 38 mmol of edtad was dissolved completely in anhydrous dmf 8 5 ml at 85 c and then returned to 50 c after the addition of dmap 12 65 mg 103 6 μmol and a piece of ce monolith 56 mg the reaction mixture was stirred at 50 c under argon after 24 h the resultant functionalized ce monolith edtad ce monolith was washed consecutively with dmf distilled water saturated solution of nahco3 distilled water meoh and at last dried in vacuo 2 5 batch adsorption studies the adsorption performance of edta ce monolith for cd2 was investigated by batch adsorption experiments typically one piece of edta ce monolith 10 mg was put into 10 ml of cd2 solution ph 5 with initial concentrations of 100 mg l after shaking at 200 rpm for 3 h at room temperature the adsorbent edta ce monolith was directly taken out from the cd2 solution to finish the adsorption process all the adsorption experiments were repeated for three times after that the adsorption parameters including ph value adsorbent dosage contact time and initial concentration of cd2 were examined under other fixed conditions described above to evaluate the effect of ph value cd2 solutions with ph values ranged from 2 2 to 6 1 adjusted by 0 1 m of hcl and naoh were used for batch adsorption the effect of adsorbent dosage was investigated by performing the batch adsorption experiments using different amount of edta ce monolith immersed into cd2 solution the effect of contact time was examined from 0 to 180 min and the adsorption kinetics was analyzed accordingly then the influence of initial concentration of cd2 solution in the range of 3 5 to 157 8 mg l was studied and the adsorption isotherm were investigated afterwards the reusability of edta ce monolith was evaluated through repeating cd2 adsorption desorption experimental cycle for 6 times by batch experiments the desorption procedure was performed by washing the edta ce monolith with 0 1 m hcl and water thoroughly followed by repeating the adsorption procedure then the removal efficiency was calculated after each cycle to assess the reusability of edta ce monolith the cd2 concentrations in all the adsorption experiments were determined either by aas or icp ms the adsorption capacity of edta ce monolith and the removal efficiency were calculated using eq 1 and 2 respectively 51 1 q c 0 c t v m 2 r c 0 c t c 0 100 where q was adsorption capacity of edta ce monolith mg g c0 and ct were concentrations of cd2 before and after adsorption mg l r was the removal efficiency v represented the volume of cd2 solution ml and m was the dry weight of edta ce monolith mg 2 6 fixed bed column adsorption to carry out the fixed bed column adsorption one piece of the edtad ce monolith 30 mg 7 0 mm diameter 6 0 mm length was directly fixed into a heat shrink tube through heating at 90 c for 2 min and then connected to the syringe pump fig s1 after that the cd2 solution with concentrations of 100 6 mg l was flow through the fixed edtad ce monolith at room temperature using a syringe pump with a constant flow rate of 0 3 ml min and the effluent samples were collected at preset time intervals 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation of functionalized ce monolith edta ce monolith in order to achieve cd2 adsorption chelating functional groups were needed to be introduced into ce monoith which was fabricated through tips method and post alkaline hydrolysis however the hydroxyl groups located on the ce monolith exhibited relatively low reactivity because of the formation of intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds therefore edtad carrying anhydride groups showing high reactivity was employed to react with hydroxyl groups of ce monolith through esterification reaction during the reaction process it was worth mentioning that integrity of monolith material afforded great convenience for the purification procedures which required only several washing of the resultant edta ce monolith in order to characterize the inner structure of resultant edta ce monolith sem and n2 adsorption desorption isotherm were performed and the results were presented in fig 2 it was clearly observed from fig 2 a that edta ce monolith possessed a uniformly interconnected porous structure with average pore diameter of 4 2 0 8 μm illustrating the existence of macroporous structure fig 2 b was the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm of edta ce monolith it can be seen that edta ce monolith exhibited a type iv isotherm curve with a h1 hysteresis loop which was the typical characteristic of mesoporous materials and the pore size distribution plot inset of fig 2 b also revealed the extensive presence of uniform mesoporous structures of edta ce monolith the specific surface area of edta ce monolith was 20 m2 g calculated through the multi point bet equation based on above results it can be proved the prepared edta ce monolith has a unique hierarchically porous morphology including both macro and mesopores simultaneously the macropores inside the edta ce monolith could offer wide channels for fast mass transfer ability and the mesopores may provide large surface area resulting in strong adsorption capacity which was extremely favorable for the metal ions adsorption the ft ir spectra of ca ce and edta ce monolith were showed in fig 3 in the spectrum of ce monolith fig 3 b the characteristic peak located at 1746 cm 1 ascribed to stretching vibration of c o bond of the acetyl group of ca monolith disappeared and a new broad peak at 3350 cm 1 corresponding to the stretching vibration of oh group was clearly found illustrating the successful preparation of ce monolith in the spectrum of edta ce monolith fig 3 c a new peak located at 1732 cm 1 appeared assigned to the stretching vibration of c o derived from the newly formed ester bond additionally the characteristic peaks located at 1587 and 1404 cm 1 were symmetric and asymmetric vibrations of coo group confirming the successful fabrication of edta ce monolith which could be used as the adsorbent for heavy metal ions besides elemental analysis was performed to identify the quantity of introduced edta group onto ce monolith and the result was shown in table 1 it can be found that edta ce monolith exhibited higher nitrogen content than ce monolith and the edta moiety introduced into edta ce monolith was calculated as 0 964 mmol g mechanical property is extremely important for porous material to guarantee its suitability for practical application here the compressive property of edta ce monolith was measured by an electronic universal material testing machine at room temperature with a compressing rate of 2 mm min the compressive stress strain curve of edta ce monolith was showed in fig s2 it can be observed that edta ce monolith showed a typical compressive behavior of porous material the stress strain curve exhibited as a linear elastic deformation at low stains 0 10 strain and then a stress plateau region after that a rapid increase for both the stain and stress was observed in the final stage at densification region after the compressive process edta ce monolith showed as an extremely dense disc appearance with no failure detected even at high strain of 80 according to iso 844 2004 for determination of compressive properties of rigid cellular plastics the compressive strength of edta ce monolith was 0 182 mpa obtained with the compressive stress at 10 of strain and the compressive modulus was 1 82 mpa calculated through the linear portion of 0 10 strain in the compressive stress stain curve implying an excellent compressive property of edta ce monolith 3 2 batch adsorption studies 3 2 1 effect of ph value ph value plays a significant role on the adsorption performance of edta ce monolith for cd2 since it influences the surface charge states of adsorbent and the species of metal ions fig 4 a showed the influence of ph value on adsorption behavior of edta ce monolith at low ph value the adsorption capacity of edta ce monoith was relatively poor the adsorption capacity enhanced greatly when ph was elevated from 2 2 to 5 1 and then kept virtually constant with ph value was further raised to 6 1 here ph values higher than 6 1 were not explored because cd oh 2 precipitation would be produced and interfere with the adsorption results at lower ph values the chelating groups in edta ce monolith including carboxylate coo and tertiary amine n were more prone to protonation and therefore positively charged exhibiting repulsion for cd2 together with the strong competition between h ions and cd2 edta ce monolith showed a weak adsorption capacity for cd2 as the ph value increased carboxylate and tertiary amine groups located on edta ce monolith were gradually deprotonated and became negatively charged showing a strong attraction for cd2 together with the reduction of the amount of h the adsorption capacity of edta ce monolith was greatly boosted when ph value was further raised the adsorption capacity of edta ce monolith had no significant change because of saturated occupation of adsorption sites according to the above results ph value of 5 1 with an adsorption capacity of 72 3 mg g was selected for the following experiments 3 2 2 effect of adsorbent dosage fig 4 b showed the effect of adsorbent dosage on the adsorption behavior of edta ce monolith for cd2 the result indicated that the removal efficiency increased gradually in the first stage and then reached an almost steady value illustrating the achieving of adsorption equilibrium it was found the highest removal efficiency of edta ce monolith for cd2 was 91 9 with the adsorbent dosage of 3 0 mg ml at first the active adsorption sites increased along with the increase of adsorption dosage resulting in improved removal efficiency when the adsorbent dosage increases to a certain extent the increase of adsorbent had less effect on the removal efficiency moreover the utilization of higher adsorbent dosage in this stage led to a lower adsorption capacity of edta ce monolith due to the increase of adsorption sites that have not reached saturation i e the adsorption sites of adsorbent were occupied with a relatively lower efficiency considering the adsorption cost and removal efficiency adsorption dosage of 0 8 mg ml was determined for other experiments 3 2 3 effect of contact time and kinetics modelling the effect of contact time on the adsorption performance of edta ce monolith was displayed in fig 4 c at first the adsorption capacity of edta ce monolith raised quickly from beginning to ca 20 min because there were plenty of vacant adsorption sites on the exterior part of edta ce monolith available for cd2 adsorption also relatively large concentration difference of cd2 between aqueous solution and adsorbent would result in high driving force at the initial stage after 20 min the adsorption capacity increased slowly because most of the surface adsorption sites were occupied in this stage and cd2 ions needed to pass through the surface and entered into the inner structure of edta ce monolith to combine the adsorption sites in addition the driving force started declining as the cd2 concentration in the solution decreased which was another reason for the slow increase of adsorption capacity in the last stage from 90 to 180 min the adsorption capacity kept steady because all the adsorption sites of edta ce monolith basically reached adsorption saturation and the adsorption equilibrium has been achieved at 150 min to examine adsorption kinetics of edta ce monolith the pseudo first order model pfom and pseudo second order model psom were applied and the mathematical equations of the two kinetic models were shown as follows 52 3 q t q e 1 e k f t 4 q t k s q e 2 t 1 k s q e t where qt and qe were adsorption capacity of edta ce monolith for cd2 calculated at time t and equilibrium mg g kf and ks were adsorption rate constants of pfom min 1 and psom g mg 1 min 1 respectively t represented the contact time min fig 5 a showed the kinetics fitting curves of pfom and psom and the corresponding kinetics data were calculated and list in table 2 it can be seen that the correlation coefficient value r2 of psom was 0 993 which was slightly higher than that of pfom 0 968 due to the small difference of r2 value between the two models other frequently applied statistical parameters including chi square χ2 sum of square error sse and root mean square error rmse were also calculated to evaluate the performance of the kinetics models as showed in table 2 the values of χ2 sse and rmse were 1 79 54 25 and 1 90 from psom model which were much lower than those from pfom model 8 82 263 41 and 4 19 additionally the calculated value of qe qe cal of psom 77 0 mg g was much closer to the experimental value of qe qe exp 73 1 mg g compared to that of pfom 67 1 mg g these results demonstrated the cd2 adsorption onto edta ce monolith followed the psom very well implying that psom could be utilized to predict the adsorption behavior of edta ce monolith 3 2 4 effect of initial concentration and isotherm modelling the effect of cd2 initial concentration on the adsorption performance of edta ce monolith was depicted in fig 4 d it was discovered that the adsorption capacity of edta ce monolith enhanced dramatically at relatively low cd2 initial concentrations followed by becoming steady when the adsorption arrived equilibrium the reason was the increase of initial cd2 concentration could provide stronger driving force to overcome the resistance to the mass transfer of cd2 from the solution to edta ce monolith in addition for fixed adsorbent dosage a higher initial concentration could raise the opportunity of the contacts and interactions between cd2 and edta ce monolith to study the adsorption isotherms of cd2 onto edta ce monolith langmuir and freundlich isotherm models were applied and their model equations were shown as follows 53 5 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 6 q e k f c e 1 n where qm was the maximum monomolecular layer adsorption capacity of edta ce monolith mg g kl and kf were adsorption constants of langmuir and freundlich models l mg ce was the cd2 concentration at equilibrium mg l and n was exponent of freundlich model representing a favorable or unfavorable adsorption process fig 5 b presented the nonlinear fitting curves of langmuir and freundlich models of cd2 adsorption onto edta ce monolth and the associated isotherm data were calculated and listed in table 3 it was found that the nonlinear correlation coefficient r2 value calculated from langmuir model was 0 981 which was significantly larger than that of freundlich model 0 936 in addition other statistical parameters of χ2 sse and rmse were calculated to evaluate the fitting results of the isotherm models from table 3 it can be seen that the values of χ2 sse and rmse for langmuir model 7 35 133 26 and 3 65 were smaller than those for freundlich model 14 13 445 01 and 6 67 therefore the adsorption process was more consistent with langmuir model meaning that cd2 ions were adsorbed and formed a monomolecular layer on edta ce monolith with homogeneous binding sites according to langmuir model the qm of edta ce monolith was determined to be 110 1 mg g showing an extremely strong adsorption capacity for cd2 3 3 fixed bed column adsorption in order to simulate the practical cd2 adsorption the fixed bed column adsorption of edta ce monolith was carried out in this study the edta ce monolith used as the cd2 adsorbent possessed a great advantage compared to conventional powder beads fiber or membrane adsorbents which was it could be fabricated in a column shape and packed into column conveniently moreover the three dimensional interconnected inner porous structure in monolith material could reduce the void volume effectively and therefore it was extremely suitable to be employed in fixed bed column adsorption fig 6 was the breakthrough curve of the fixed bed column adsorption of edta ce monolith for cd2 which was plotted through the ratio of effluent to influent concentration of cd2 versus time the breakthrough point and exhaustion point of edta ce monolith set at 10 and 95 of the influent cd2 concentrations were 2 8 and 29 63 min respectively which were quite close to each other as a result the breakthrough curve exhibited a typical s shape with high steepness implying that the edta ce monolith showed high efficiency for cd2 adsorption and it was possible to utilize a large fraction of the theoretical capacity of the adsorbent detailed information and calculation results for the fixed bed column adsorption was supplied in the supplementary material it can be found that the total removal percentage reff of edta ce monolith was calculated as 11 14 and the equilibrium cd2 uptake qbed was 11 77 mg g indicating its large potential in practical wastewater treatment 3 4 reusability of edta ce monolith as an ideal adsorbent for cd2 removal an excellent reusability is also required apart from high adsorption capacity which is critical for reducing the water treatment costs presently the most commonly used adsorbents for metal removal were powders beads fiber and magnetic materials and their adsorption and reuse procedures always required filtration centrifugation or magnet separation which were extremely tedious and time consuming in this study the monolith material was particularly convenient for adsorption and reuse operations due to its one piece feature which allowed it to be directly taken out from the cd2 solution fig 7 showed the results of reusability of edta ce monolith for cd2 through batch experiments it was found that the removal efficiency of edta ce monolith remained virtually unchanged in the first 5 successive cycles and only slightly decreased to 87 3 after the 6th cycle probably because the adsorbed cd2 were not washed thoroughly based on the above results it was proved that edta ce monolith maintained an excellent cd2 removal efficiency implying its excellent stability and reusability and therefore was exceptionally suitable for practical waste water treatment 3 5 adsorption mechanism to reveal the cd2 adsorption mechanism of edta ce monolith eds analysis was carried out to determine the elemental composition of the cross section of edta ce monolith from fig 8 a it can be seen that the c 46 03 wt o 43 20 wt n 1 93 wt and na 8 80 wt elemental peaks were detected and almost no cd signal 0 04 wt was found for the edta ce monolith before adsorption whereas the cd energy peaks located at 3 13 3 33 and 3 55 kev were clearly observed and there was hardly any na elemental peak in the spectrum of edta ce monolith after adsorption in fig 8 b illustrating that cd2 ions were adsorbed successfully on edta ce monolith and the high elemental composition value of cd 47 02 wt demonstrated that edta ce monolith exhibited an extremely high cd2 absorption capacity fig 8 c and e were the eds mapping images of cd element of edta ce monolith before and after cd2 adsorption it can be observed the large amount of cd element were distributed uniformly onto the inner structure of edta ce monolith resulting from its three dimensional open cellular interconnected porous structure and the eds mapping of na element images in fig 8 d and f showed that the na content decreased largely after adsorption which was consistent with the results of eds spectra fig 4 b therefore absorption mechanism of edta ce monolith probably involved the ion exchange between na and cd2 in aqueous solution in addition xps measurement was also performed to analyze the cd2 adsorption mechanism onto edta ce monolith and the results were recorded in fig 9 the xps wide scans of edta ce monolith before and after cd2 adsorption were presented in fig 9 a it can be observed that the intensity of na signals including na1s and na auger peaks located at 1071 3 and 497 3 ev decreased largely in the spectrum of edta ce monolith after adsorption this phenomenon was probably due to the ion exchange of na with cd2 in the adsorption process which was in accordance with the eds measurements in addition new peaks in the range of 395 415 ev appeared after adsorption in fig 9 a which were very close to n1s signals and assigned to the cd3d binding energy for further demonstration the cd3d narrow scan fig 9 b was also performed and exhibited two clear peaks located at 405 7 and 412 4 ev ascribed to cd3d5 2 and cd3d3 2 respectively confirming that cd2 were adsorbed onto edta ce monolith additionally the binding energy of cd3d5 2 in cd no3 2 was 406 4 ev 54 which was much higher than that in edta ce monolith after cd2 adsorption implying the interaction of cd2 and functional groups located on edta ce monolith the cd2 adsorption mechanism was further explored through the n1s and o1s narrow scans as showed in fig 9 c edta ce monolith exhibited two n1s peaks with binding energy of 399 2 and 401 6 ev corresponding to cn from edta and the protonated n atom 55 56 after cd2 adsorption the cn peak moved to the direction of higher binding energy located at 400 2 ev which was caused by the share of electron pair of n atom with cd atom after the formation of coordinate bonds between n and cd2 fig 6 e and f were the o1s narrow scans of edta ce monolith before and after cd2 adsorption through peak analysis o1s peaks can be divided into c o oh c o c coo and o c o c with binding energy of 530 8 532 7 and 535 1 ev before adsorption after adsorption with cd2 the coo peak shifted to a higher binding energy of 534 3 ev and other o1s peaks were almost unchanged which was due to the reduction of electron cloud density around o atom along with the chelating interaction of coo with cd2 ions coo cd therefore it can be proved that the main groups of edta ce monolith related to the cd2 adsorption were the carboxyl and tertiary amino functional groups based on the results of above eds and xps analysis ion exchange and chemical coordination were the most possible binding mechanism of cd2 adsorbed onto edta ce monolith similar mechanism was also reported in other studies 57 60 4 conclusions in this study a functionalized cellulose based monolith edta ce monolith was obtained through esterification of ce monolith which was fabricated via tips and post alkaline hydrolysis the resultant edta ce monolith possessed a hierarchical structure with macro and mesopores simultaneously and an excellent compressive strength which was extremely suitable for removal of heavy metal ions according to the results of the batch and fixed bed column experiments it can be found that the adsorption of edta ce monolith for cd2 was relatively fast and followed the pseudo second order kinetics model besides the adsorption process was consistent with langmuir isotherm model and the calculated maximum adsorption capacity of edta ce monolith was up to 110 1 mg g the fixed bed column adsorption illustrated that the edta ce monolith showed high efficiency for cd2 adsorption furthermore edta ce monolith could be regenerated easily and exhibited excellent reusability without significant loss of absorption capacity importantly the unique integrity characteristic of edta ce monolith afforded it with great convenience during the modification adsorption and regeneration process combined with other advantages such as high hydrophilicity excellent biodegradability strong mechanical strength solvent resistance as well as low cost derived from cellulose staring material the fabricated edta ce

12953,in this study a functionalized cellulose based monolith was utilized as a highly efficient adsorbent to remove heavy metal ions firstly cellulose based monolith ce monolith was obtained via

without significant loss of absorption capacity the fixed bed column adsorption implied that edta ce monolith showed high efficiency for cd2 adsorption therefore the edta ce monolith fabricated in this work had large potential to be used as an efficient adsorbent for the removal of heavy metal ions in wastewater treatment graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords cellulose based monolith hierarchically porous structure efficient adsorbent cadmium ii ion wastewater treatment 1 introduction rapid expansion of global industry has led to a series of serious environmental pollutions particularly heavy metal ions in industrial wastewater pose a great threat to both ecosystem and human life due to their huge harmfulness most of the heavy metal ions could not be decomposed naturally and thus accumulate in the water circulation and soil resulting in an enrichment in agricultural products and then transfer to human bodies because heavy metal ions cannot be completely metabolized they could cause severe damage to human health 1 5 cadmium ii cd2 is one of the typical toxic heavy metal ions which could store easily in certain organs and therefore cause lung insufficiency chronic renal disease liver dysfunctions as well as skeleton damage in addition it has been categorized as a carcinogen to human being by international agency for research on cancer 6 9 so far there are various methods that have been developed to deal with the heavy metal removal including chemical precipitation 10 11 membrane filtration 12 14 ion exchange 15 16 and electrochemical treatment 17 18 among them adsorption is regarded as one of the most promising technologies because of the simple procedure high removal efficiency low cost and without any secondary pollution 19 21 for adsorption technology adsorbent is the crucial factor and the most commonly used adsorbents are zeolites 22 modified clays 23 24 metal oxides 25 27 carbon nanotubes 28 29 metal organic frameworks 30 31 and certain polymer based materials 32 33 whereas most of them always suffered from low adsorption efficiency capacity slow adsorption rate high cost poor stability and reusability as well as complicated fabrication process therefore an efficient eco friendly economic and facile fabricated adsorbent for the removal of heavy metal ions is urgently required for adsorption technology monolith is a newly emerging material possessing a three dimensional open cellular interconnected porous morphology which is constructed in one single piece 34 39 due to these unique structural features monolith is considered to be an ideal adsorbent for heavy metal removal from industrial wastewater to be specific the inner flow through porous structure is favorable for highly efficient adsorption the structural integrity offers monolith simple operation without any secondary pollution and the excellent dimensional stability and mechanical strength guarantee the reusability of the material cellulose is the most abundant existing organic compound in nature and has been widely applied in numerous fields owing to its low price it is a kind of naturally derived polymer composed of a linear chain of d glucose units linked by β 1 4 glycosidic bonds 40 42 the presence of a large number of hydroxyl groups located in the chemical structure of cellulose molecule afford it high hydrophilicity and the facility to be modified into a variety of functionalities combined with the low production cost and excellent biocompatibility as well as strong chemical and thermal stability cellulose was employed as the starting material to fabricate monolith to efficiently remove heavy metal ions in this study in our previous work cellulose based monolith ce monolith with a hierarchically porous morphology was successfully obtained through thermally induced phase separation tips of cellulose acetate monolith combined with subsequent alkaline hydrolysis 43 tips is a novel technology for the monolith fabrication that uses polymer itself as a precursor compared to conventional fabrication techniques such as polymerization process tips is a kind of simple rapid and energy saving approach which could modulate the inner porous morphology easily additionally the monolith shape can be tuned conveniently through altering the form of the container 44 50 here tips technology was particularly suitable for fabricating ce monolith because cellulose was a naturally derived polymer without any available monomer in this study we successfully constructed a highly efficient adsorbent for the removal of heavy metal ions i e a functionalized ce monolith edta ce monolith with a hierarchically porous structure in the production process ce monolith was firstly fabricated through tips and post

replacement by etoh and drying in vacuo subsequently ca monolith was immersed in a naoh solution in meoh 0 15 m and stirred at 30 c for 3 h to complete the alkaline hydrolysis after neutralizing with hcl and washing by h2o and meoh ce monolith was obtained through drying under vacuum at 50 c 2 4 modification of ce monolith ce monolith was modified through esterification reaction of its hydroxyl groups with edtad fig 1 the specific process was described as follows 353 9 mg 1 38 mmol of edtad was dissolved completely in anhydrous dmf 8 5 ml at 85 c and then returned to 50 c after the addition of dmap 12 65 mg 103 6 μmol and a piece of ce monolith 56 mg the reaction mixture was stirred at 50 c under argon after 24 h the resultant functionalized ce monolith edtad ce monolith was washed consecutively with dmf distilled water saturated solution of nahco3 distilled water meoh and at last dried in vacuo 2 5 batch adsorption studies the adsorption performance of edta ce monolith for cd2 was investigated by batch adsorption experiments typically one piece of edta ce monolith 10 mg was put into 10 ml of cd2 solution ph 5 with initial concentrations of 100 mg l after shaking at 200 rpm for 3 h at room temperature the adsorbent edta ce monolith was directly taken out from the cd2 solution to finish the adsorption process all the adsorption experiments were repeated for three times after that the adsorption parameters including ph value adsorbent dosage contact time and initial concentration of cd2 were examined under other fixed conditions described above to evaluate the effect of ph value cd2 solutions with ph values ranged from 2 2 to 6 1 adjusted by 0 1 m of hcl and naoh were used for batch adsorption the effect of adsorbent dosage was investigated by performing the batch adsorption experiments using different amount of edta ce monolith immersed into cd2 solution the effect of contact time was examined from 0 to 180 min and the adsorption kinetics was analyzed accordingly then the influence of initial concentration of cd2 solution in the range of 3 5 to 157 8 mg l was studied and the adsorption isotherm were investigated afterwards the reusability of edta ce monolith was evaluated through repeating cd2 adsorption desorption experimental cycle for 6 times by batch experiments the desorption procedure was performed by washing the edta ce monolith with 0 1 m hcl and water thoroughly followed by repeating the adsorption procedure then the removal efficiency was calculated after each cycle to assess the reusability of edta ce monolith the cd2 concentrations in all the adsorption experiments were determined either by aas or icp ms the adsorption capacity of edta ce monolith and the removal efficiency were calculated using eq 1 and 2 respectively 51 1 q c 0 c t v m 2 r c 0 c t c 0 100 where q was adsorption capacity of edta ce monolith mg g c0 and ct were concentrations of cd2 before and after adsorption mg l r was the removal efficiency v represented the volume of cd2 solution ml and m was the dry weight of edta ce monolith mg 2 6 fixed bed column adsorption to carry out the fixed bed column adsorption one piece of the edtad ce monolith 30 mg 7 0 mm diameter 6 0 mm length was directly fixed into a heat shrink tube through heating at 90 c for 2 min and then connected to the syringe pump fig s1 after that the cd2 solution with concentrations of 100 6 mg l was flow through the fixed edtad ce monolith at room temperature using a syringe pump with a constant flow rate of 0 3 ml min and the effluent samples were collected at preset time intervals 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation of functionalized ce monolith edta ce monolith in order to achieve cd2 adsorption chelating functional groups were needed to be introduced into ce monoith which was fabricated through tips method and post alkaline hydrolysis however the hydroxyl groups located on the ce monolith exhibited relatively low reactivity because of the formation of intramolecular and intermolecular hydrogen bonds therefore edtad carrying anhydride groups showing high reactivity was employed to react with hydroxyl groups of ce monolith through esterification reaction during the reaction process it was worth mentioning that integrity of monolith material afforded great convenience for the purification procedures which required only several washing of the resultant edta ce monolith in order to characterize the inner structure of resultant edta ce monolith sem and n2 adsorption desorption isotherm were performed and the results were presented in fig 2 it was clearly observed from fig 2 a that edta ce monolith possessed a uniformly interconnected porous structure with average pore diameter of 4 2 0 8 μm illustrating the existence of macroporous structure fig 2 b was the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm of edta ce monolith it can be seen that edta ce monolith exhibited a type iv isotherm curve with a h1 hysteresis loop which was the typical characteristic of mesoporous materials and the pore size distribution plot inset of fig 2 b also revealed the extensive presence of uniform mesoporous structures of edta ce monolith the specific surface area of edta ce monolith was 20 m2 g calculated through the multi point bet equation based on above results it can be proved the prepared edta ce monolith has a unique hierarchically porous morphology including both macro and mesopores simultaneously the macropores inside the edta ce monolith could offer wide channels for fast mass transfer ability and the mesopores may provide large surface area resulting in strong adsorption capacity which was extremely favorable for the metal ions adsorption the ft ir spectra of ca ce and edta ce monolith were showed in fig 3 in the spectrum of ce monolith fig 3 b the characteristic peak located at 1746 cm 1 ascribed to stretching vibration of c o bond of the acetyl group of ca monolith disappeared and a new broad peak at 3350 cm 1 corresponding to the stretching vibration of oh group was clearly found illustrating the successful preparation of ce monolith in the spectrum of edta ce monolith fig 3 c a new peak located at 1732 cm 1 appeared assigned to the stretching vibration of c o derived from the newly formed ester bond additionally the characteristic peaks located at 1587 and 1404 cm 1 were symmetric and asymmetric vibrations of coo group confirming the successful fabrication of edta ce monolith which could be used as the adsorbent for heavy metal ions besides elemental analysis was performed to identify the quantity of introduced edta group onto ce monolith and the result was shown in table 1 it can be found that edta ce monolith exhibited higher nitrogen content than ce monolith and the edta moiety introduced into edta ce monolith was calculated as 0 964 mmol g mechanical property is extremely important for porous material to guarantee its suitability for practical application here the compressive property of edta ce monolith was measured by an electronic universal material testing machine at room temperature with a compressing rate of 2 mm min the compressive stress strain curve of edta ce monolith was showed in fig s2 it can be observed that edta ce monolith showed a typical compressive behavior of porous material the stress strain curve exhibited as a linear elastic deformation at low stains 0 10 strain and then a stress plateau region after that a rapid increase for both the stain and stress was observed in the final stage at densification region after the compressive process edta ce monolith showed as an extremely dense disc appearance with no failure detected even at high strain of 80 according to iso 844 2004 for determination of compressive properties of rigid cellular plastics the compressive strength of edta ce monolith was 0 182 mpa obtained with the compressive stress at 10 of strain and the compressive modulus was 1 82 mpa calculated through the linear portion of 0 10 strain in the compressive stress stain curve implying an excellent compressive property of edta ce monolith 3 2 batch adsorption studies 3 2 1 effect of ph value ph value plays a significant role on the adsorption performance of edta ce monolith for cd2 since it influences the surface charge states of adsorbent and the species of metal ions fig 4 a showed the influence of ph value on adsorption behavior of edta ce monolith at low ph value the adsorption capacity of edta ce monoith was relatively poor the adsorption capacity enhanced greatly when ph was elevated from 2 2 to 5 1 and then kept virtually constant with ph value was further raised to 6 1 here ph values higher than 6 1 were not explored because cd oh 2 precipitation would be produced and interfere with the adsorption results at lower ph values the chelating groups in edta ce monolith including carboxylate coo and tertiary amine n were more prone to protonation and therefore positively charged exhibiting repulsion for cd2 together with the strong competition between h ions and cd2 edta ce monolith showed a weak adsorption capacity for cd2 as the ph value increased carboxylate and tertiary amine groups located on edta ce monolith were gradually deprotonated and became negatively charged showing a strong attraction for cd2 together with the reduction of the amount of h the adsorption capacity of edta ce monolith was greatly boosted when ph value was further raised the adsorption capacity of edta ce monolith had no significant change because of saturated occupation of adsorption sites according to the above results ph value of 5 1 with an adsorption capacity of 72 3 mg g was selected for the following experiments 3 2 2 effect of adsorbent dosage fig 4 b showed the effect of adsorbent dosage on the adsorption behavior of edta ce monolith for cd2 the result indicated that the removal efficiency increased gradually in the first stage and then reached an almost steady value illustrating the achieving of adsorption equilibrium it was found the highest removal efficiency of edta ce monolith for cd2 was 91 9 with the adsorbent dosage of 3 0 mg ml at first the active adsorption sites increased along with the increase of adsorption dosage resulting in improved removal efficiency when the adsorbent dosage increases to a certain extent the increase of adsorbent had less effect on the removal efficiency moreover the utilization of higher adsorbent dosage in this stage led to a lower adsorption capacity of edta ce monolith due to the increase of adsorption sites that have not reached saturation i e the adsorption sites of adsorbent were occupied with a relatively lower efficiency considering the adsorption cost and removal efficiency adsorption dosage of 0 8 mg ml was determined for other experiments 3 2 3 effect of contact time and kinetics modelling the effect of contact time on the adsorption performance of edta ce monolith was displayed in fig 4 c at first the adsorption capacity of edta ce monolith raised quickly from beginning to ca 20 min because there were plenty of vacant adsorption sites on the exterior part of edta ce monolith available for cd2 adsorption also relatively large concentration difference of cd2 between aqueous solution and adsorbent would result in high driving force at the initial stage after 20 min the adsorption capacity increased slowly because most of the surface adsorption sites were occupied in this stage and cd2 ions needed to pass through the surface and entered into the inner structure of edta ce monolith to combine the adsorption sites in addition the driving force started declining as the cd2 concentration in the solution decreased which was another reason for the slow increase of adsorption capacity in the last stage from 90 to 180 min the adsorption capacity kept steady because all the adsorption sites of edta ce monolith basically reached adsorption saturation and the adsorption equilibrium has been achieved at 150 min to examine adsorption kinetics of edta ce monolith the pseudo first order model pfom and pseudo second order model psom were applied and the mathematical equations of the two kinetic models were shown as follows 52 3 q t q e 1 e k f t 4 q t k s q e 2 t 1 k s q e t where qt and qe were adsorption capacity of edta ce monolith for cd2 calculated at time t and equilibrium mg g kf and ks were adsorption rate constants of pfom min 1 and psom g mg 1 min 1 respectively t represented the contact time min fig 5 a showed the kinetics fitting curves of pfom and psom and the corresponding kinetics data were calculated and list in table 2 it can be seen that the correlation coefficient value r2 of psom was 0 993 which was slightly higher than that of pfom 0 968 due to the small difference of r2 value between the two models other frequently applied statistical parameters including chi square χ2 sum of square error sse and root mean square error rmse were also calculated to evaluate the performance of the kinetics models as showed in table 2 the values of χ2 sse and rmse were 1 79 54 25 and 1 90 from psom model which were much lower than those from pfom model 8 82 263 41 and 4 19 additionally the calculated value of qe qe cal of psom 77 0 mg g was much closer to the experimental value of qe qe exp 73 1 mg g compared to that of pfom 67 1 mg g these results demonstrated the cd2 adsorption onto edta ce monolith followed the psom very well implying that psom could be utilized to predict the adsorption behavior of edta ce monolith 3 2 4 effect of initial concentration and isotherm modelling the effect of cd2 initial concentration on the adsorption performance of edta ce monolith was depicted in fig 4 d it was discovered that the adsorption capacity of edta ce monolith enhanced dramatically at relatively low cd2 initial concentrations followed by becoming steady when the adsorption arrived equilibrium the reason was the increase of initial cd2 concentration could provide stronger driving force to overcome the resistance to the mass transfer of cd2 from the solution to edta ce monolith in addition for fixed adsorbent dosage a higher initial concentration could raise the opportunity of the contacts and interactions between cd2 and edta ce monolith to study the adsorption isotherms of cd2 onto edta ce monolith langmuir and freundlich isotherm models were applied and their model equations were shown as follows 53 5 q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 6 q e k f c e 1 n where qm was the maximum monomolecular layer adsorption capacity of edta ce monolith mg g kl and kf were adsorption constants of langmuir and freundlich models l mg ce was the cd2 concentration at equilibrium mg l and n was exponent of freundlich model representing a favorable or unfavorable adsorption process fig 5 b presented the nonlinear fitting curves of langmuir and freundlich models of cd2 adsorption onto edta ce monolth and the associated isotherm data were calculated and listed in table 3 it was found that the nonlinear correlation coefficient r2 value calculated from langmuir model was 0 981 which was significantly larger than that of freundlich model 0 936 in addition other statistical parameters of χ2 sse and rmse were calculated to evaluate the fitting results of the isotherm models from table 3 it can be seen that the values of χ2 sse and rmse for langmuir model 7 35 133 26 and 3 65 were smaller than those for freundlich model 14 13 445 01 and 6 67 therefore the adsorption process was more consistent with langmuir model meaning that cd2 ions were adsorbed and formed a monomolecular layer on edta ce monolith with homogeneous binding sites according to langmuir model the qm of edta ce monolith was determined to be 110 1 mg g showing an extremely strong adsorption capacity for cd2 3 3 fixed bed column adsorption in order to simulate the practical cd2 adsorption the fixed bed column adsorption of edta ce monolith was carried out in this study the edta ce monolith used as the cd2 adsorbent possessed a great advantage compared to conventional powder beads fiber or membrane adsorbents which was it could be fabricated in a column shape and packed into column conveniently moreover the three dimensional interconnected inner porous structure in monolith material could reduce the void volume effectively and therefore it was extremely suitable to be employed in fixed bed column adsorption fig 6 was the breakthrough curve of the fixed bed column adsorption of edta ce monolith for cd2 which was plotted through the ratio of effluent to influent concentration of cd2 versus time the breakthrough point and exhaustion point of edta ce monolith set at 10 and 95 of the influent cd2 concentrations were 2 8 and 29 63 min respectively which were quite close to each other as a result the breakthrough curve exhibited a typical s shape with high steepness implying that the edta ce monolith showed high efficiency for cd2 adsorption and it was possible to utilize a large fraction of the theoretical capacity of the adsorbent detailed information and calculation results for the fixed bed column adsorption was supplied in the supplementary material it can be found that the total removal percentage reff of edta ce monolith was calculated as 11 14 and the equilibrium cd2 uptake qbed was 11 77 mg g indicating its large potential in practical wastewater treatment 3 4 reusability of edta ce monolith as an ideal adsorbent for cd2 removal an excellent reusability is also required apart from high adsorption capacity which is critical for reducing the water treatment costs presently the most commonly used adsorbents for metal removal were powders beads fiber and magnetic materials and their adsorption and reuse procedures always required filtration centrifugation or magnet separation which were extremely tedious and time consuming in this study the monolith material was particularly convenient for adsorption and reuse operations due to its one piece feature which allowed it to be directly taken out from the cd2 solution fig 7 showed the results of reusability of edta ce monolith for cd2 through batch experiments it was found that the removal efficiency of edta ce monolith remained virtually unchanged in the first 5 successive cycles and only slightly decreased to 87 3 after the 6th cycle probably because the adsorbed cd2 were not washed thoroughly based on the above results it was proved that edta ce monolith maintained an excellent cd2 removal efficiency implying its excellent stability and reusability and therefore was exceptionally suitable for practical waste water treatment 3 5 adsorption mechanism to reveal the cd2 adsorption mechanism of edta ce monolith eds analysis was carried out to determine the elemental composition of the cross section of edta ce monolith from fig 8 a it can be seen that the c 46 03 wt o 43 20 wt n 1 93 wt and na 8 80 wt elemental peaks were detected and almost no cd signal 0 04 wt was found for the edta ce monolith before adsorption whereas the cd energy peaks located at 3 13 3 33 and 3 55 kev were clearly observed and there was hardly any na elemental peak in the spectrum of edta ce monolith after adsorption in fig 8 b illustrating that cd2 ions were adsorbed successfully on edta ce monolith and the high elemental composition value of cd 47 02 wt demonstrated that edta ce monolith exhibited an extremely high cd2 absorption capacity fig 8 c and e were the eds mapping images of cd element of edta ce monolith before and after cd2 adsorption it can be observed the large amount of cd element were distributed uniformly onto the inner structure of edta ce monolith resulting from its three dimensional open cellular interconnected porous structure and the eds mapping of na element images in fig 8 d and f showed that the na content decreased largely after adsorption which was consistent with the results of eds spectra fig 4 b therefore absorption mechanism of edta ce monolith probably involved the ion exchange between na and cd2 in aqueous solution in addition xps measurement was also performed to analyze the cd2 adsorption mechanism onto edta ce monolith and the results were recorded in fig 9 the xps wide scans of edta ce monolith before and after cd2 adsorption were presented in fig 9 a it can be observed that the intensity of na signals including na1s and na auger peaks located at 1071 3 and 497 3 ev decreased largely in the spectrum of edta ce monolith after adsorption this phenomenon was probably due to the ion exchange of na with cd2 in the adsorption process which was in accordance with the eds measurements in addition new peaks in the range of 395 415 ev appeared after adsorption in fig 9 a which were very close to n1s signals and assigned to the cd3d binding energy for further demonstration the cd3d narrow scan fig 9 b was also performed and exhibited two clear peaks located at 405 7 and 412 4 ev ascribed to cd3d5 2 and cd3d3 2 respectively confirming that cd2 were adsorbed onto edta ce monolith additionally the binding energy of cd3d5 2 in cd no3 2 was 406 4 ev 54 which was much higher than that in edta ce monolith after cd2 adsorption implying the interaction of cd2 and functional groups located on edta ce monolith the cd2 adsorption mechanism was further explored through the n1s and o1s narrow scans as showed in fig 9 c edta ce monolith exhibited two n1s peaks with binding energy of 399 2 and 401 6 ev corresponding to cn from edta and the protonated n atom 55 56 after cd2 adsorption the cn peak moved to the direction of higher binding energy located at 400 2 ev which was caused by the share of electron pair of n atom with cd atom after the formation of coordinate bonds between n and cd2 fig 6 e and f were the o1s narrow scans of edta ce monolith before and after cd2 adsorption through peak analysis o1s peaks can be divided into c o oh c o c coo and o c o c with binding energy of 530 8 532 7 and 535 1 ev before adsorption after adsorption with cd2 the coo peak shifted to a higher binding energy of 534 3 ev and other o1s peaks were almost unchanged which was due to the reduction of electron cloud density around o atom along with the chelating interaction of coo with cd2 ions coo cd therefore it can be proved that the main groups of edta ce monolith related to the cd2 adsorption were the carboxyl and tertiary amino functional groups based on the results of above eds and xps analysis ion exchange and chemical coordination were the most possible binding mechanism of cd2 adsorbed onto edta ce monolith similar mechanism was also reported in other studies 57 60 4 conclusions in this study a functionalized cellulose based monolith edta ce monolith was obtained through esterification of ce monolith which was fabricated via tips and post alkaline hydrolysis the resultant edta ce monolith possessed a hierarchical structure with macro and mesopores simultaneously and an excellent compressive strength which was extremely suitable for removal of heavy metal ions according to the results of the batch and fixed bed column experiments it can be found that the adsorption of edta ce monolith for cd2 was relatively fast and followed the pseudo second order kinetics model besides the adsorption process was consistent with langmuir isotherm model and the calculated maximum adsorption capacity of edta ce monolith was up to 110 1 mg g the fixed bed column adsorption illustrated that the edta ce monolith showed high efficiency for cd2 adsorption furthermore edta ce monolith could be regenerated easily and exhibited excellent reusability without significant loss of absorption capacity importantly the unique integrity characteristic of edta ce monolith afforded it with great convenience during the modification adsorption and regeneration process combined with other advantages such as high hydrophilicity excellent biodegradability strong mechanical strength solvent resistance as well as low cost derived from cellulose staring material the fabricated edta ce monolith was an ideal candidate as an efficient adsorbent for the removal of heavy metal ions in wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare they have no known competing financial

keywords antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater treatment performance hydraulic retention time microbial community antibiotics resistance genes 1 introduction antibiotics have been widely used to save millions of human beings and animal lives through protection them from infectious diseases 1 the antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater has been identified as the major source of antibiotics in the surface water leading to the potential health threats to humans and environmental risks to the natural environment 2 chemical synthesis and fermentation are typical production processes of antibiotics which generate a large amount of wastewater containing high levels of solvents recalcitrant organics and residual antibiotics 3 many studies have been conducted to seek for the appropriate antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater treatment technology including physicochemical and biological approaches 2 5 among them the biological treatment stands out owing to its relatively high efficiency for antibiotics degradation and chemical oxygen demand cod removal 6 7 due to the drawbacks of the aerobic process for high strength wastewater treatment the anaerobic process has been proved to be promising to remove organic matters and decompose recalcitrant organics 2 8 9 numerous modern anaerobic processes have been implemented including upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb 10 expanded granular sludge blanket egsb 11 upflow anaerobic stage reactor uasr 12 and anaerobic baffled reactor abr 7 internal circulation ic reactor is the representative of the third generation of anaerobic reactor which has advantages over uasb reactor such as smaller footprint higher organic loading rate olr and more resilient to shock loading 13 however few studies have been conducted using the ic anaerobic reactor for high concentration refractory organic wastewater which may be owing to the poor biogas generation during the start up resulting in inadequate mixing of wastewater and biomass and hence low mass transfer efficiency 14 our previous study successfully modified the ic anaerobic reactor by adding an external hydraulic circulation system and applied it to dye wastewater treatment 14 it is therefore interesting to investigate whether the mic reactor can be successfully used for other refractory wastewater treatment such as real antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater it is widely acknowledged that the residual antibiotics released to the environment have the ability to exert selective pressure on environmental microorganisms 15 leading to the propagation of antibiotic resistance genes args 1 16 args are increasingly being recognized as a new contaminant 17 18 posing major threats to environmental security and public health 1 previous research has suggested that residue sludge may have the potential to release more args than the effluent 19 21 it is also suggested that remarkably higher abundance of args were found in the sludge from pharmaceutical than

removal by the mic anaerobic reactor treating demeclocycline antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater in the initial start up period the cod removal efficiency gradually climbed from 32 to 92 with the increase of influent cod from around 1213 to 15 328 mg l hrt 4 days during stage ii with olr of 4 3 4 6 kg cod m3 day hrt 4 days a relatively stable cod removal efficiency of 92 was obtained further reduction of the hrt to 3 days with olr of 5 5 6 3 kg cod m3 day slightly decreased cod removal efficiency to 82 chen et al 10 also demonstrated that uasb reactor can obtain 83 91 cod removal efficiency with olr increasing from 2 7 to 7 2 kg cod m3 day treating pharmaceutical wastewater the reduced cod removal efficiency can be explained by the insufficient contact between the inoculum sludge and the organic matters 25 interestingly transition periods with an obvious decrease followed by a gradual increase trend of cod removal efficiency were observed when higher olr was applied for example when hrt reduced from 4 days to 3 days with olr increase from 4 3 4 6 to 5 5 6 3 kg cod m3 day the cod removal was inhibited and the cod removal efficiency significantly reduced from 91 to 71 followed by a gradual increase trend to 82 ng et al 26 also observed this transition period when increased the olr of anaerobic membrane bioreactor for chemical synthesis based pharmaceutical wastewater treatment this was probably attributed to the microbiome s adaption to the new environment in the mic reactor due to the short shock loading 25 a similar trend can also be observed for antibiotic demeclocycline removal fig 2b indicating more than 80 84 removal efficiency during the stable operation with an hrt of 4 days and 3 days this suggested that demeclocycline 54 3 mg l as a typical class of tetracycline antibiotics could be effectively degraded in the mic anaerobic reactor previous studies also reported similar satisfied antibiotic removal for tetracycline antibiotics such as oxytetracycline and tetracycline 3 11 the nitrogen removal in the mic anaerobic reactor was also investigated fig 2c during the start up stage when total nitrogen increased from 70 to 540 mg l the tn removal rate gradually increased from 18 to over 52 tn removal efficiency can be maintained at approximately 52 with a hrt of 4 days and a further decrease of the hrt to 3 days can slightly reduce the tn removal efficiency to 47 however the mic anaerobic reactor did not remove the ammonia nh4 n indicating a 37 59 increase compared with influent and effluent fig s1 this might be explained by the influent total organic nitrogen decomposition under anaerobic environment 10 furthermore the effluent nh4 n concentration was maintained at 312 27 mg l during stage ii and stage iii occupying more than 90 of the total nitrogen vfa ph and biogas production can indicate the operation conditions of an anaerobic reactor especially for the methanogenic activity assessment fig 3a showed relatively low vfa concentration 240 mg l in the effluent during the whole experimental trial a stable effluent ph ranging from 7 1 to 8 1 was also observed this indicated a stable operation of mic anaerobic reactor for demeclocycline antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater treatment as vfa was not accumulated in the system and can be effectively used to convert to methane 14 it is also worth noting that significantly higher vfa of 190 mg l was observed in the effluent with hrt of 3 days during stage iii compared with that of 54 mg l with hrt of 4 days during stage ii this might be owing to the relatively short contact time between the substrate and biomass sludge resulting in the limited substrate conversion to methane and therefore substantial vfa washout 12 the methane production in mic anaerobic reactor during the start up period stage ii and stage iii were shown fig 3b during the start up period the ch4 production increased from 0 15 to 22 3 l day as the olr increased from 0 3 to 3 8 kg cod m3 day during stage ii and stage iii with olr of 4 3 4 6 and 5 5 6 3 kg cod m3 day relatively stable ch4 production of 25 0 30 l day was obtained equivalent to 0 30 l ch4 g cod removed this is comparable to the theoretical value 0 35 l ch4 g cod removed 27 and indicated that the biogas production is not inhibited by the antibiotic existence 3 2 evolution of microbial community the structure of microbial community at different stages of the experiment was analyzed to have an insight into the impact of the antibiotics demeclocycline on the mic anaerobic reactor treatment performance from the microbial diversity aspects bacteroidetes firmicutes proteobacteria and synergistetes were the top four bacterial phyla fig 4a this is also the predominant phylum in previous anaerobic wastewater treatment reactors 28 31 in the inoculum sludge bacteroidetes dominated the bacterium at the phylum level occupying 64 9 of the relative abundance however with the elevated olr and antibiotic concentrations the relative abundance of bacteroidetes remarkably reduced to 16 0 after the 115 day operation this indicated that bacteroidetes was inhibited by the increased olr and demeclocycline it is also noteworthy that firmicutes proteobacteria and synergistetes were gradually enriched during the experiment firmicutes became the most predominant phylum accounting for 38 4 of the relative abundance ohore et al 32 also reported the enrichment of firmicutes and proteobacteria under tetracycline pressure possibly due to the acquisition of antibiotic genes from other microbes horizontally and vertically genes mutation or elimination ensuring their survival and increasing their relative abundance 33 furthermore coban et al 34 also reported the dominance of firmicutes with 87 of total abundance at the phylum level of the bacterial community in an anaerobic digester with oxytetracycline fig 4b demonstrated major bacterial community at genus level in the sludge from mic anaerobic reactor bacteroides 28 1 and parabacteroides 22 1 were the top two genus bacteria these two genus bacteria were regarded as hydrolytic fermentative bacteria which related to the complex organic matters decomposition 35 36 with the step wise increase of organic loading rate and demeclocycline stress the relative abundance of both bacteroides and parabacteroides gradually decreased to only 8 6 and 1 5 however the relative abundance of enterococcus and cloacibacillus significantly increased occupying 17 4 and 9 3 of the total genus bacteria respectively previous studies also indicated that enterococcus was resistant to multiple antibiotics 37 cloacibacillus is responsible for carbohydrate metabolism to volatile fatty acids under anaerobic conditions 38 and the relatively stable organic removal in the mic reactor can be explained by the cloacibacillus accumulation previous studies also reported a relatively high abundance of cloacibacillus at genus level in an egsb reactor treating amoxicillin manufacture wastewater 11 39 as for the archaea methanobacterium methanobrevicacter methanosaeta and methanosphaera become the top four archaea at the genus level occupying more than 90 of the relative abundance in the inoculum sludge fig 4c with the introduction of demeclocycline the relative abundance of methanosphaera increased remarkably to over 87 of the total archaea at genus level after 115 day experimental trials the genus methanosphaera was hydrogenotrophic methanogens which has the ability to use h2 to reduce methanol to methane and gain energy for growth instead of using h2 co2 formic acid acetate and methylamines to produce methane 40 the relatively high abundance of methanosphaera indicated that it has good tolerance to stressful conditions and methanol might be very crucial to methane production under demeclocycline antibiotics stress on the contrary the abundance of methanosaeta gradually decreased from 31 3 to 4 7 methanosaeta is a typical aceticlastic methanogen and the significant decrease indicated that it is sensitive to inhibitors in antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater 41 li et al 42 also reported that the predominant methane production pathway changed from aceticlastic pathway to hydrogenotroph in an egsb reactor for cephalosporin antibiotic wastewater treatment 3 3 antibiotic resistance genes and inti 1 evolutions the evolutions of six tetracycline resistance genes teta tetc tecg tecm teco tecw and a mobile element inti1 were quantified in the sludge from mic anaerobic reactor during the whole experimental trials fig 5 the total args relative abundance increased from 0 03 to 0 90 by 1 48 orders of magnitude after stage i and stage ii operation fig 5a this might be explained by the adsorbed demeclocycline in the inoculum sludge in the mic anaerobic reactor leading to the args enrichment owing to the high antibiotic pressure 43 the significant increase of args was mainly due to the proliferation of tetc tetg and inti1 occupying more than 90 of the total targeted genes fig 5b when the hrt decreased from 4 days to 3 days and the olr increased from 4 3 4 6 to 5 5 6 0 kg cod m3 day the relative abundance of the targeted args in the mic reactor gradually decreased by 45 8 to 0 49 after stage iii operation which can be mainly ascribed to the decrease of tetc tetg and inti1 on the contrary the relative abundance of teca teco and tecw enriched becoming the prevalent args accounted for more than 90 of the total targeted genes under short hrt operation with higher olr fig 5b although greater stress from the demeclocycline antibiotic was incurred under shorter hrt the higher absolute abundance of the args at longer hrt might be due to the properties of tec genes and longer exposure time between biomass and antibiotics 44 similarly liao et al 44 also indicated that higher targeted genes abundances were observed at a longer hrt even though it is an aerobic granular sludge reactor therefore although longer hrt can be conducive for antibiotic removal it may increase the risk of args proliferation in the sludge the correlation analysis between arg subtypes and inti1 were further conducted fig 5c a significantly correlation was observed between teca tecm teco and tecw p 0 05 implying that these args might be cooccurring or co selected by mobile genetic elements 45 furthermore tecc and tecg displayed a strong positive correlation with inti1 p 0 05 which indicates that the horizontal transfer is important in their proliferation previous study also reported a strong correlation between tecc tecg and inti1 46 3 4 args and microbial community correlations the correlations between the microbial community both bacteria and archaea and target genes were undertaken to evaluate the possible args related hosts fig 6 a strong positive correlation was observed between teca tecm teco tecw and comamonas enterococcus cloacibacillus comamonas belongs to the family comamonadaceae class betaproteobacteria and phylum proteobacteria hu et al 47 also reported that the mobile args were predominantly found in the proteobacteria phyla shen et al 48 suggested that comamonas was the potential host of many args enterococcus belongs to the family enterococcaceae class bacilli and phylum firmicutes which was reported to harbour the args 49 additionally cloacibacillus as gram negative bacteria has multiple plasmids which can carry resistance genes 39 bacteria was known as hosts and played a vital role in args spreading 50 the pearson s correlation results also indicated that methanosphaera positively correlated args teca tecm teco tecw previous studies reported that some archaea have the potential to carry args and can exchange genetic information with bacteria 50 51 this finding highlighted that the role of archaea in the args proliferation should not be neglected 4 conclusions this study evaluated the viability to apply a modified ic anaerobic reactor for real antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater treatment and further to decipher the microbial diversity and args evolutions during the treatment the following conclusions can be drawn mic anaerobic reactor can be successfully applied to antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater treatment with over 82 92 of cod removal efficiency and 80 84 of demeclocycline removal efficiency at hrt of 4 days and 3 days bacteroidetes at phylum level was inhibited by the increased olr and demeclocycline while firmicutes became predominant bacteria methanosaeta as a typical aceticlastic methanogen was significantly restrained under demeclocycline antibiotic stress while methanosphaera as a hydrogenotrophic methanogen dominated indicating that the predominant methane production pathway changed from aceticlastic pathway to hydrogenotroph args evaluation results indicated that higher hrt may increase the risk of args proliferation even though better antibiotic removal efficiency can be achieved comamonas enterococcus cloacibacillus and methanosphaera become the potential hosts of args and played an important role in args spreading and dissemination declaration of

12954,antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater is a typical high concentration refractory organic wastewater which may hinder the biological treatment performance during the treatment the reactor has the potential to become the hotspot for the spread of antibiotic resistance genes args this study evaluated the viability to apply a modified internal circulation mic anaerobic reactor with external circulation to real antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater treatment and further to decipher the microbial diversity and args evolutions results indicated over 82 92 of cod removal efficiency and 80 84 of demeclocycline removal efficiency at hrt of 4 days and 3 days additionally the antibiotics wastewater substantially modified the structure of microbial community firmicutes replaced the bacteroidetes becoming the predominant bacteria at the phylum level methanosaeta was significantly restrained under antibiotic stress while methanosphaera dominated suggesting that the predominant methane production pathway changed from aceticlastic pathway to hydrogenotroph args evaluation results indicated that higher hrt may increase the risk of args proliferation the correlation between args and microbial community implied that comamonas enterococcus cloacibacillus and methanosphaera become the potential args hosts and played an important role in args dissemination importantly mic anaerobic reactor can be successfully applied to demeclocycline antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater but the risk of args in the sludge should be not neglected graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater treatment performance hydraulic retention time microbial community antibiotics resistance genes 1 introduction antibiotics have been widely used to save millions of human beings and animal lives through protection them from infectious diseases 1 the antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater has been identified as the major source of antibiotics in the surface water leading to the potential health threats to humans and environmental risks to the natural environment 2 chemical synthesis and fermentation are typical production processes of antibiotics which generate a large amount of wastewater containing high levels of solvents recalcitrant organics and residual antibiotics 3 many studies have been conducted to seek for the appropriate antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater treatment technology including physicochemical and biological approaches 2 5 among them the biological treatment stands out owing to its relatively high efficiency for antibiotics degradation and chemical oxygen demand cod removal 6 7 due to the drawbacks of the aerobic process for high strength wastewater treatment the anaerobic process has been proved to be promising to remove organic matters and decompose recalcitrant organics 2 8 9 numerous modern anaerobic processes have been implemented including upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb 10 expanded granular sludge blanket egsb 11 upflow anaerobic stage reactor uasr 12 and anaerobic baffled reactor abr 7 internal circulation ic reactor is the representative of the third generation of anaerobic reactor which has advantages over uasb reactor such as smaller footprint higher organic loading rate olr and more resilient to shock loading 13 however few studies have been conducted using the ic anaerobic reactor for high concentration refractory organic wastewater which may be owing to the poor biogas generation during the start up resulting in inadequate mixing of wastewater and biomass and hence low mass transfer efficiency 14 our previous study successfully modified the ic anaerobic reactor by adding an external hydraulic circulation system and applied it to dye wastewater treatment 14 it is therefore interesting to investigate whether the mic reactor can be successfully used for other refractory wastewater treatment such as real antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater it is widely acknowledged that the residual antibiotics released to the environment have the ability to exert selective pressure on environmental microorganisms 15 leading to the propagation of antibiotic resistance genes args 1 16 args are increasingly being recognized as a new contaminant 17 18 posing major threats to environmental security and public health 1 previous research has suggested that residue sludge may have the potential to release more args than the effluent 19 21 it is also suggested that remarkably higher abundance of args were found in the sludge from pharmaceutical than municipal wastewater treatment plant 22 however limited study focused on the args evolution during the anaerobic biological treatment especially for high strength antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater treatment the purpose of this research is therefore to evaluate the viability to apply a modified ic anaerobic reactor to real antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater treatment and further to decipher the microbial diversity and args evolutions during the treatment the specific objectives are to i evaluate the mic performance for demeclocycline dmc antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater treatment ii investigate the microbial diversity and args evaluations in the sludge phase of mic reactor for dmc antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater treatment and to iii identify the potential hosts of args through the correlation analyses between args bacterial archaea community 2 materials and methods 2 1 modified internal circulation reactor set up and operation the modified internal circulation mic

second anaerobic zone sedimentation zone and gas liquid separation zone 14 compared with the conventional ic reactor with internal circulation an external recirculation system was applied in order to generate fluidization of the first anaerobic zone and improve the mass transfer between wastewater and biomass 14 a recirculation pump was control to provide an external circulation flow rate of 27 2

consisted of glucose was first fed to the reactor to acclimate with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 4 days for over 30 days demeclocycline is a typical tetracycline antibiotic which has been used to treat many bacterial infections 23 demeclocycline antibiotic wastewater was acquired from a pharmaceutical plant shaoxing zhejiang province china table 1 listed the characteristics of demeclocycline antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater during the start up period stage i 1 54 days the mix of demeclocycline antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater and tap water was fed to the mic reactor at a hrt of 4

bivariate correlation analysis was used to evaluate the correlations between args and inti1 spearman correlation analysis was conducted to investigate the correlations between args inti1 and microbial community bacteria and archaea at the genus level 3 results and discussions 3 1 process performance of mic anaerobic reactor fig 2 showed the temporal changes of cod demeclocycline and total nitrogen removal by the mic anaerobic reactor treating demeclocycline antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater in the initial start up period the cod removal efficiency gradually climbed from 32 to 92 with the increase of influent cod from around 1213 to 15 328 mg l hrt 4 days during stage ii with olr of 4 3 4 6 kg cod m3 day hrt 4 days a relatively stable cod removal efficiency of 92 was obtained further reduction of the hrt to 3 days with olr of 5 5 6 3 kg cod m3 day slightly decreased cod removal efficiency to 82 chen et al 10 also demonstrated that uasb reactor can obtain 83 91 cod removal efficiency with olr increasing from 2 7 to 7 2 kg cod m3 day treating pharmaceutical wastewater the reduced cod removal efficiency can be explained by the insufficient contact between the inoculum sludge and the organic matters 25 interestingly transition periods with an obvious decrease followed by a gradual increase trend of cod removal efficiency were observed when higher olr was applied for example when hrt reduced from 4 days to 3 days with olr increase from 4 3 4 6 to 5 5 6 3 kg cod m3 day the cod removal was inhibited and the cod removal efficiency significantly reduced from 91 to 71 followed by a gradual increase trend to 82 ng et al 26 also observed this transition period when increased the olr of anaerobic membrane bioreactor for chemical synthesis based pharmaceutical wastewater treatment this was probably attributed to the microbiome s adaption to the new environment in the mic reactor due to the short shock loading 25 a similar trend can also be observed for antibiotic demeclocycline removal fig 2b indicating more than 80 84 removal efficiency during the stable operation with an hrt of 4 days and 3 days this suggested that demeclocycline 54 3 mg l as a typical class of tetracycline antibiotics could be effectively degraded in the mic anaerobic reactor previous studies also reported similar satisfied antibiotic removal for tetracycline antibiotics such as oxytetracycline and tetracycline 3 11 the nitrogen removal in the mic anaerobic reactor was also investigated fig 2c during the start up stage when total nitrogen increased from 70 to 540 mg l the tn removal rate gradually increased from 18 to over 52 tn removal efficiency can be maintained at approximately 52 with a hrt of 4 days and a further decrease of the hrt to 3 days can slightly reduce the tn removal efficiency to 47 however the mic anaerobic reactor did not remove the ammonia nh4 n indicating a 37 59 increase compared with influent and effluent fig s1 this might be explained by the influent total organic nitrogen decomposition under anaerobic environment 10 furthermore the effluent nh4 n concentration was maintained at 312 27 mg l during stage ii and stage iii occupying more than 90 of the total nitrogen vfa ph and biogas production can indicate the operation conditions of an anaerobic reactor especially for the methanogenic activity assessment fig 3a showed relatively low vfa concentration 240 mg l in the effluent during the whole experimental trial a stable effluent ph ranging from 7 1 to 8 1 was also observed this indicated a stable operation of mic anaerobic reactor for demeclocycline antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater treatment as vfa was not accumulated in the system and can be effectively used to convert to methane 14 it is also worth noting that significantly higher vfa of 190 mg l was observed in the effluent with hrt of 3 days during stage iii compared with that of 54 mg l with hrt of 4 days during stage ii this might be owing to the relatively short contact time between the substrate and biomass sludge resulting in the limited substrate conversion to methane and therefore substantial vfa washout 12 the methane production in mic anaerobic reactor during the start up period stage ii and stage iii were shown fig 3b during the start up period the ch4 production increased from 0 15 to 22 3 l day as the olr increased from 0 3 to 3 8 kg cod m3 day during stage ii and stage iii with olr of 4 3 4 6 and 5 5 6 3 kg cod m3 day relatively stable ch4 production of 25 0 30 l day was obtained equivalent to 0 30 l ch4 g cod removed this is comparable to the theoretical value 0 35 l ch4 g cod removed 27 and indicated that the biogas production is not inhibited by the antibiotic existence 3 2 evolution of microbial community the structure of microbial community at different stages of the experiment was analyzed to have an insight into the impact of the antibiotics demeclocycline on the mic anaerobic reactor treatment performance from the microbial diversity aspects bacteroidetes firmicutes proteobacteria and synergistetes were the top four bacterial phyla fig 4a this is also the predominant phylum in previous anaerobic wastewater treatment reactors 28 31 in the inoculum sludge bacteroidetes dominated the bacterium at the phylum level occupying 64 9 of the relative abundance however with the elevated olr and antibiotic concentrations the relative abundance of bacteroidetes remarkably reduced to 16 0 after the 115 day operation this indicated that bacteroidetes was inhibited by the increased olr and demeclocycline it is also noteworthy that firmicutes proteobacteria and synergistetes were gradually enriched during the experiment firmicutes became the most predominant phylum accounting for 38 4 of the relative abundance ohore et al 32 also reported the enrichment of firmicutes and proteobacteria under tetracycline pressure possibly due to the acquisition of antibiotic genes from other microbes horizontally and vertically genes mutation or elimination ensuring their survival and increasing their relative abundance 33 furthermore coban et al 34 also reported the dominance of firmicutes with 87 of total abundance at the phylum level of the bacterial community in an anaerobic digester with oxytetracycline fig 4b demonstrated major bacterial community at genus level in the sludge from mic anaerobic reactor bacteroides 28 1 and parabacteroides 22 1 were the top two genus bacteria these two genus bacteria were regarded as hydrolytic fermentative bacteria which related to the complex organic matters decomposition 35 36 with the step wise increase of organic loading rate and demeclocycline stress the relative abundance of both bacteroides and parabacteroides gradually decreased to only 8 6 and 1 5 however the relative abundance of enterococcus and cloacibacillus significantly increased occupying 17 4 and 9 3 of the total genus bacteria respectively previous studies also indicated that enterococcus was resistant to multiple antibiotics 37 cloacibacillus is responsible for carbohydrate metabolism to volatile fatty acids under anaerobic conditions 38 and the relatively stable organic removal in the mic reactor can be explained by the cloacibacillus accumulation previous studies also reported a relatively high abundance of cloacibacillus at genus level in an egsb reactor treating amoxicillin manufacture wastewater 11 39 as for the archaea methanobacterium methanobrevicacter methanosaeta and methanosphaera become the top four archaea at the genus level occupying more than 90 of the relative abundance in the inoculum sludge fig 4c with the introduction of demeclocycline the relative abundance of methanosphaera increased remarkably to over 87 of the total archaea at genus level after 115 day experimental trials the genus methanosphaera was hydrogenotrophic methanogens which has the ability to use h2 to reduce methanol to methane and gain energy for growth instead of using h2 co2 formic acid acetate and methylamines to produce methane 40 the relatively high abundance of methanosphaera indicated that it has good tolerance to stressful conditions and methanol might be very crucial to methane production under demeclocycline antibiotics stress on the contrary the abundance of methanosaeta gradually decreased from 31 3 to 4 7 methanosaeta is a typical aceticlastic methanogen and the significant decrease indicated that it is sensitive to inhibitors in antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater 41 li et al 42 also reported that the predominant methane production pathway changed from aceticlastic pathway to hydrogenotroph in an egsb reactor for cephalosporin antibiotic wastewater treatment 3 3 antibiotic resistance genes and inti 1 evolutions the evolutions of six tetracycline resistance genes teta tetc tecg tecm teco tecw and a mobile element inti1 were quantified in the sludge from mic anaerobic reactor during the whole experimental trials fig 5 the total args relative abundance increased from 0 03 to 0 90 by 1 48 orders of magnitude after stage i and stage ii operation fig 5a this might be explained by the adsorbed demeclocycline in the inoculum sludge in the mic anaerobic reactor leading to the args enrichment owing to the high antibiotic pressure 43 the significant increase of args was mainly due to the proliferation of tetc tetg and inti1 occupying more than 90 of the total targeted genes fig 5b when the hrt decreased from 4 days to 3 days and the olr increased from 4 3 4 6 to 5 5 6 0 kg cod m3 day the relative abundance of the targeted args in the mic reactor gradually decreased by 45 8 to 0 49 after stage iii operation which can be mainly ascribed to the decrease of tetc tetg and inti1 on the contrary the relative abundance of teca teco and tecw enriched becoming the prevalent args accounted for more than 90 of the total targeted genes under short hrt operation with higher olr fig 5b although greater stress from the demeclocycline antibiotic was incurred under shorter hrt the higher absolute abundance of the args at longer hrt might be due to the properties of tec genes and longer exposure time between biomass and antibiotics 44 similarly liao et al 44 also indicated that higher targeted genes abundances were observed at a longer hrt even though it is an aerobic granular sludge reactor therefore although longer hrt can be conducive for antibiotic removal it may increase the risk of args proliferation in the sludge the correlation analysis between arg subtypes and inti1 were further conducted fig 5c a significantly correlation was observed between teca tecm teco and tecw p 0 05 implying that these args might be cooccurring or co selected by mobile genetic elements 45 furthermore tecc and tecg displayed a strong positive correlation with inti1 p 0 05 which indicates that the horizontal transfer is important in their proliferation previous study also reported a strong correlation between tecc tecg and inti1 46 3 4 args and microbial community correlations the correlations between the microbial community both bacteria and archaea and target genes were undertaken to evaluate the possible args related hosts fig 6 a strong positive correlation was observed between teca tecm teco tecw and comamonas enterococcus cloacibacillus comamonas belongs to the family comamonadaceae class betaproteobacteria and phylum proteobacteria hu et al 47 also reported that the mobile args were predominantly found in the proteobacteria phyla shen et al 48 suggested that comamonas was the potential host of many args enterococcus belongs to the family enterococcaceae class bacilli and phylum firmicutes which was reported to harbour the args 49 additionally cloacibacillus as gram negative bacteria has multiple plasmids which can carry resistance genes 39 bacteria was known as hosts and played a vital role in args spreading 50 the pearson s correlation results also indicated that methanosphaera positively correlated args teca tecm teco tecw previous studies reported that some archaea have the potential to carry args and can exchange genetic information with bacteria 50 51 this finding highlighted that the role of archaea in the args proliferation should not be neglected 4 conclusions this study evaluated the viability to apply a modified ic anaerobic reactor for real antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater treatment and further to decipher the microbial diversity and args evolutions during the treatment the following conclusions can be drawn mic anaerobic reactor can be successfully applied to antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater treatment with over 82 92 of cod removal efficiency and 80 84 of demeclocycline removal efficiency at hrt of 4 days and 3 days bacteroidetes at phylum level was inhibited by the increased olr and demeclocycline while firmicutes became predominant bacteria methanosaeta as a typical aceticlastic methanogen was significantly restrained under demeclocycline antibiotic stress while methanosphaera as a hydrogenotrophic methanogen dominated indicating that the predominant methane production pathway changed from aceticlastic pathway to hydrogenotroph args evaluation results indicated that higher hrt may increase the risk of args proliferation even though better antibiotic removal efficiency can be achieved comamonas enterococcus cloacibacillus and methanosphaera become the potential hosts of args and played an important role in args spreading and dissemination declaration of
