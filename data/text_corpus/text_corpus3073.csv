15365,fractured rock aquifers are susceptible to contamination with metal loid s rapidly migrating from poorly developed overburden to the fractured rock vadose zone and thus into groundwater compared to typical porous aquifers retention effects within the rock matrix are small and rapid advection along fractures leads to a higher risk of groundwater contamination however the highly complex anisotropic pathways of natural fractures hinder research in this field to construct reproducible fractures this study used 3d printing following computed x ray microtomography μct scans of a fractured rock collected in a natural limestone aquifer stimulated metalloid release was observed in the fractured rock during column leaching and the leachate concentrations of arsenic as and antimony sb increased by up to 17 5 and 36 4 times respectively compared with the porous vadose zone fluctuations in fracture metalloid release patterns in dissolved and adsorbed phases were attributed to retention and filtration effects induced by soil particles within fractures geophysical properties of the porous overburden especially the aggregation characteristics greatly affected the non equilibrium leaching behavior of as but had a limited effect on the near equilibrium leaching of sb which was explored by modifying the surficial soil layer with either montmorillonite clay or charcoal the results of this study provide a novel method and useful information for modeling and risk assessment of fractured rock aquifers graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

earth providing drinking water to billions of people around the world de graaf et al 2019 famiglietti 2014 however 97 of this valuable resource is non renewable on centennial timescales and is highly susceptible and difficult to recover once polluted abbott et al 2019 porous aquifers have been a hotspot of groundwater research for decades the rest i e fractured fissured rock aquifers like carbonates tight sandstones and consolidated volcanic rocks are much less explored despite their ubiquitous in more than 120 countries such aquifers spread over one fifth of the country s total area e g 22 for china 25 for usa and 33 for germany igrac 2020 although less explored risks associated with contaminant transport are expected to increase in fractured rock aquifers in porous aquifers contaminants adsorb to fine soil particles such as silt and clay in the unsaturated zone i e the vadose zone limiting their vertical penetration into the saturated zone radcliffe and simunek 2018 this is why in most cases heavy metals with high partition coefficients in the overburden do not cause groundwater pollution in porous aquifers dong et al 2009 uddh söderberg et al 2019 however a few evidences have shown that in regions where fractured rock aquifer are developed contaminants may migrate vertically from source zones to groundwater with subsequent horizontal movement and contamination of large areas compared with small contaminated zones in the surficial soil hartmann et al 2021 kalhor et al 2019 low contaminant retention in the rock matrix and rapid groundwater flow along fissures that favor advection are potential causes jarvie et al 2014 schiperski et al 2016 note that rapid flow can also occur in porous media known as the preferential flow where water and solute pass through certain pathways while bypassing a fraction of porous soil matrix the preferential flow phenomenon can originate from the soil surface following incipient ponding during rainfall events clothier et al 2007 orozco lópez et al 2018 bulk density and macroporosity of the soil particles are main influencing factors clothier et al 2007 in this manuscript however rapid flow within rock fissures instead of soil particles is investigated a main challenge in the experimental study of contaminant transport in fractured rock is the desktop model design unlike porous media where highly reproducible experiments can be made by adding quartz sand or soil particles of known texture to the column fracture formation is highly case specific several studies have used field collected fractured rocks to study contaminant transport characteristics but an inherent obstacle to this approach is the use of different unreproducible fractured rock cores in each treatment group arnon et al 2005 chen et al 2010 the unreproducible nature of fractured rock aquifer studies greatly hinders experimental and modeling explorations in this field additionally most existing studies have only investigated transport processes of artificially spiked contaminants in saturated fractured rocks ignoring the crucial role of the historically contaminated overburden itself as a source of contaminants take metal loid s as an example historical mining and other industrial activities have led to their accumulation in thin surficial soil layer in karst regions gao et al 2022 hou et al 2020a wang et al 2022a during rainfall events metal loid s will be leached into the shallow porous vadose zone below the contaminated soil and eventually into the fractured rock aquifer qin et al 2021 different leaching characteristics from the porous overburden will result in different migration patterns across fractures in this context this study explores the leaching patterns of metalloids i e as and sb in a historically contaminated soil across the fractured rock vadose zone computed x ray microtomography μct scanning and 3d printing were used to obtain reproducible fractures above which a clean soil layer and a contaminated source zone were placed as the porous overburden in this novel column leaching study design migration mechanisms of metalloids in fractures was further explored finally the contaminated surficial soil was enriched with charcoal or montmorillonite to investigate whether the geophysical properties of the overburden affected metalloid leaching through the underlying fractures 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental design four polymethyl methacrylate leaching columns were set up of which three experimental groups were 3d printed fractured rock vadose zones and one control group contained only porous vadose zones fig 1 3d printed fractured rock vadose zone a cylindrical fractured rock core 9 cm in diameter 50 cm in length was collected in a fractured limestone aquifer with a rock auger at a sampling depth of 32 7 m after that the rock sample was selected and scanned using a μct nanovoxel 5000 sanying precision instruments co ltd china a cylindrical part of the scanned model 3 cm in diameter 5 cm in length containing fracture was further used to obtain the reconstructed 3d model scanning was conducted at 300 kv with a square pixel density of 3072 3072 the resolution of μct scanning was 0 0035 cm the porosity of the rock n f r a c t u r e was determined to be 5 46 the aperture of the fracture within the rock ranged from 0 016 to 0 239 cm with an average aperture of 0 063 cm this value was comparable to previously reported values for fractured rock aquifers cohen et al 2019 kaufmann et al 2019 valsala and govindarajan 2018 the model was then 3d printed isla1900d zrapid tech china using transparent resin see table s1 for detailed properties the resolution of the 3d printer was 0 01 cm which was lower than the narrowest aperture allowing precise printing of fractured rock clean porous vadose zone uncontaminated soil was collected in a park ground and sieved 2 mm iso 2006 soil properties are provided in table 1 the sieved soil was packed above the printed fracture after pre roughening the sidewall of the column to avoid preferential pathway nylon mesh 75 μm was used to separate this layer from the fractured zone the dry packing method was used with an increment of 0 2 cm to assure homogeneity lewis and sjöstrom 2010 the bulk density of the porous vadose zone was set to 1 10 g cm 3 soil porosity was calculated to be 0 585 contaminated overburden historically contaminated soils were collected in southwest china historical mining activities since the 1950s have resulted in as and sb contamination of large areas of shallow poorly developed surficial soil layer he et al 2012 zhan et al 2021 worse still both elements are negatively charged oxyanions in natural soil also negatively charged rendering higher mobility compared to metal cations such as cd and pb alloway 2012 the contaminated soil was also sieved below 2 mm after that either montmorillonite a 2 1 clay mineral obtained from macklin co ltd 95 purity or charcoal biochar produced from rice husk following pyrolysis at 450 c under n2 flow with residence time 2 h were mixed with the soil at the same application rate 5 wt which is a typical value for soil amendment chen et al 2018 yang et al 2017 the porous morphology and the carbon rich nature of charcoal were observed fig s1 along with a thermal conversion induced formation of crystalline sio2 cristobalite fig s2 which is a distinct feature of rice husk derived charcoal li and delvaux 2019 shen et al 2014 the x ray diffraction xrd and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir absorption peaks of montmorillonite also confirmed the high purity of this clay mineral fig s2 fig s3 after 21 days of short term incubation at water content 30 wt historically contaminated soil ct montmorillonite enriched historically contaminated soil mont and charcoal enriched historically contaminated soil char were packed onto the clean porous vadose zone following the same packing method and bulk density nylon mesh 75 μm was used to separate this layer from the clean soil vadose zone deionized water was injected continuously into each column at 0 236 ml min 1 this value was identical to a typical soil infiltration rate during rainfall events i e 20 mm h 1 fao 1985 a thin quartz sand layer 1 cm was placed above the contaminated soil to assure uniform infiltration two sampling ports located at the bottom port a and within the middle of the fracture port b were set up leachate was collected every 4 h at two different sampling ports in the fracture columns and one sampling port at the bottom of the column where the 3d printed fractured rock vadose zone was replaced by clean soil as the porous medium the leaching experiment was conducted continuously for 120 h leachates were passed through 0 22 μm pes filter and analyzed further for as and sb concentrations an additional leaching test was also conducted for the fracture alone to explore the migration mechanism of metalloids the fracture volume fv was calculated as follows eq 1 1 f v n f r a c t u r e v f r a c t u r e 1 93 m l where v f r a c t u r e is the total volume of the 3d printed fracture the historically contaminated soil was further sieved to below 75 μm which was the size of the nylon mesh used for layer separation in simulated rainfall leaching test the sieved soil was immersed in ultrapure water resistivity 18 2 mω cm at a solid to liquid ratio of 1 20 and subjected to sonication for 2 5 h theoretically the time required to simulate rainwater passing through the contaminated layer the suspension was then added directly to the 3d printed fracture 5 fvs each time i e 9 65 ml a total of 50 fvs crossed the fracture in 10 cycles after each cycle metalloid concentrations in the dissolved phase after passing through 0 22 μm pes filter and the total metalloid concentration in the leachate after adding hno3 and hcl with volume ratio 2 1 to dissolve solids were detected the turbidity of the leachate suspension was measured and reported after a 100 fold dilution the desorption kinetics of as and sb in historically contaminated soil were also investigated at a solid to liquid ratio of 1 1 4 calculated from the soil porosity ultrapure water was used as the extractant samples were taken and centrifuged at 10 min 30 min 1 h 2 h 4 h 8 h 20 h 32 h and 44 h the liquid phase was filtered 0 22 μm prior to as and sb concentration measurements a first order desorption model was used to describe this process eq 2 3 azizian and bashiri 2008 li 1999 2 d c d t k c e c t 3

desorption rate constant a sequential extraction procedure originally established by wenzel et al 2001 was applied to investigate the geochemical fractions of as and sb in historically contaminated soil montmorillonite enriched soil and charcoal enriched soil before and after leaching this method has been widely used by previous works to investigate the fractions of these two elements garau et

with comparison of mean values of three replicates conducted using fisher lsd test at a significance level of 0 05 plotting was conducted with originpro 2018 with standard error values presented as error bars 3 results and discussion 3 1 accelerated migration in fractured rock vadose zone a sharp increase in leachate as and sb concentrations was observed for column 2 with a fractured rock vadose zone fig 2 a b as the concentrations in columns 1 and 2 were not significantly different p 0 05 at the initial 1 8 pvs this suggests that the thin porous overburden in the upper 5 cm successfully retained this metalloid for both columns after that however the as concentration increased sharply by a factor of 17 5 at 16 4 pvs suggesting that the fractured rock vadose zone failed to trap as compared to the lower 5 cm thin porous vadose zone in column 1 fig 2a antimony concentration increased more rapidly in the initial stage up to 36 4 times at 1 8 pvs and then decreased steadily fig 2b as was successfully retained in porous column 1 throughout the leaching experiment of 27 pore volumes in contrast sb was leached in the porous column after the initial 5 pore volumes fig 2b although in a much milder manner with a lower maximum leachate sb concentration i e 1118 μg l 1 compared to the fractured column i e 1705 μg l 1 different leaching patterns for as and sb may lie in the different desorption kinetics in soil fig 2d sb desorbed rapidly k 15 55 h 1 while as desorbed slowly k 7 39 h 1 it took 20 h for as to reach 80 of the total released mass in the final stage i e 44 h while it only took 10 min for sb to achieve this hence a near equilibrium transport of sb was expected 2 5 h through each porous soil layer during which sb in the surficial soil was rapidly leached into the pore water in contrast as underwent non equilibrium transport and could not be completely desorbed from the soil solid matrix into the porous medium resulting in a concentration in pore water that was much lower than the ideal equilibrium transport process two unique phenomena were observed during leaching with simulated rainfall 1 soil particles were trapped within the fracture fig 3 a b 2 a fluctuation in leachate turbidity was found fig s9 considering that the fracture matrix itself exhibited little retention of both metalloids fig 2c it was proposed that particles trapped in the fracture may have contributed to a different transport mechanism as compared with diffusion and convection processes in porous media previous works also suggested that colloid facilitated transport contributed substantially to the transport of strongly retained contaminants löv et al 2018 šimůnek et al 2006 therefore an additional transport study simulating the worst case scenario of metalloid transport due to overburden soil loss was conducted to investigate the trapping phenomenon of the fracture itself and its effects on metalloid migration fig 4 fine soil particles 75 μm were sonicated for 2 5 h then a suspension of 5 fvs was added to the fracture containing 0 48 g soil particle it was found that a small mass proportion of overburden soil entering the fracture caused the entrapment of soil particles fig 4a d where four different stages were found firstly in the initial 5 fvs soil particles blocked the fracture exit in clusters at the bottom while the clean zone still existed fig 4a note that the dissolved as and sb concentrations were the lowest fig 4e secondly at 10 fvs film like trapping was observed within the crack fig 4b leading to much lower leachate turbidity and higher dissolved and total metalloid concentrations in the leachate fig 4ef an elevated leachate metalloid concentration suggested that the shift from cluster like trapping stage 1 to film like trapping stage 2 tended to diminish the retardation effect of soil particles within the fracture thirdly at 35 fvs cluster like trapping reappeared with a more potent retardation effect compared to stage 1 fig 4c an elevated metalloid concentration in the dissolved phase was accompanied by a sharp decrease in total metal concentrations fig 4ef suggesting that soil particles trapped in this stage acted in a manner similar to that of a porous medium in which the inflowing water must be filtered by this contaminated layer of fine particles during this filtration process both turbidity and total metalloid concentration in the leachate sharply decreased due to particle retention while as and sb were desorbed from the trapped fine particles into the liquid phase resulting in an increase in the metalloid concentration in the dissolved phase finally at 50 fvs the maximum soil holding capacity was reached as evidenced by the release of weakly retained soil particles fig 4d with elevated turbidity decreased metalloid concentrations in the dissolved phase and increased total metalloid concentration observed fig 4ef an important finding is that colloid facilitated transport instead of direct transport of truly dissolved phase dominated metalloid leaching in this case as evidenced by the fact that the leachate concentration of dissolved phase only accounted for 0 5 1 5 and 1 0 3 3 of the total leached concentration of as and sb respectively fig 4ef the findings align well with previous findings that colloid facilitated transport contributed a major role for strongly retained contaminants in the vadose zone bin et al 2011 šimůnek et al 2006 some evidence has shown that the fast flow of contaminants in the saturated zone occurs in regions where fractured rock aquifers develop for instance schiperski et al 2016 found that uranine and polystyrene colloids transported rapidly at a velocity of 36 9 m h 1 in a karst aquifer with little retention another study by hartmann et al 2021 found that up to 50 of infiltrated glyphosate can reach groundwater table in carbonate rock aquifers while this value decreased sharply below 1 in porous aquifers colloid facilitated transport of herbicides i e atrazine and bromacil were observed by james et al 2022 during which contaminant sorption onto soil organic matter is the dominant process determining its mobility in terms of heavy metals and metalloids evidence from a superfund site suggested that the fractured bedrock aquifer served as preferential horizontal transport pathways of cd cu and zn from groundwater to a creek caruso and dawson 2009 colloid facilitated transport were also reported where the adsorption behavior of metalloids is a key factor affecting this process on the one hand the high adsorption capacity of soil matrix to retain metalloids highlights the primary role of colloid facilitated transport in such aquifers because the solution concentration of metalloids in pore water would be very small flury and qiu 2008 grolimund and borkovec 2005 on the other hand strong adsorption capacity of the colloid itself account for stimulated metalloid leaching for instance ferrihydrite colloids can facilitate as leaching substantially due to the strong adsorption of as to fe bearing minerals gomez gonzalez et al 2018 ma et al 2018 organic colloids were reported to stimulate both as and sb leaching because of the high affinity for the sorption of both elements macgregor et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 in this study it is found that rapid leaching also occurs in the vadose zone during simulated rainfall events two reasons account for this phenomenon first almost no adsorption was found in fractured rocks compared to porous media with high specific surface areas hendrickx and flury 2001 sahimi 2011 second soil formation is much slower in fractured rock aquifers e g karst coxon 2011 yan et al 2019 often leading to thin porous overburden that cannot effectively retain contaminants leached from the topsoil this is because karst aquifers lack the primary source of soil formation i e the insoluble residual material derived from bedrock weathering which typically constitutes less than 10 of parent limestone rock boyer 2003 a typical value of 10 cm hu et al 2020 li et al 2014 was selected for the surficial thin soil layer in this study which failed to retain metal loid indicating an elevated risk of metal loid migration to groundwater 3 2 effects of overburden characteristics on metalloid leaching throughout the leaching experiment the clay rich overburden decreased as leaching across the fractured rock vadose zone up to 96 5 at 4 5 pore volumes while the charcoal rich one dramatically stimulated as leaching by up to 32 5 times at 2 7 pore volumes fig 5 a in terms of sb leaching the overburden type had limited effect fig 5b geochemical fractions of as and sb for different treatment groups were shown in fig s5 charcoal enrichment significantly increased the proportion of the most labile form of as namely the non specifically bound form as compared with the unamended soil p 0 001 suggesting that a mobilization effect should theoretically occur montmorillonite clay amendment also increased the proportion of non specifically bound as although not statistically significant p 0 131 for both elements the geochemical fraction bound with al and fe hydrous oxides account for a large pool which is due to the fact that as and sb have high affinity towards metal oxides to form co precipitates or inner sphere complexes alloway 2012 komárek et al 2013 vithanage et al 2013 it is notable that in this historically contaminated soil the residual fraction of as and sb account for the largest pool despite the amendment type this is due to the natural long term aging process of metalloids in the soil environment which have gradually altered the labile forms into non labile ones han et al 2021 quazi et al 2010 the mobility of as and sb are also highly dependent on their valence state the mobility of as iii is higher than as v pigna et al 2015 in contrast sb iii are more strongly sorbed to soil matrix therefore less labile as compared with sb v due to its neutral characteristic over a wide ph range okkenhaug et al 2016 the chemical speciation of soil as and sb across all treatment groups and the unamended soil were exclusively as v and sb v suggesting a highly oxidized nature of the soil it is primary because the historically contaminated soils either amended or unamended possess a near neutral ph along with a high eh value table 1 in such conditions the speciation of these metalloids in the environment should theoretically be as v and sb v which aligns well with the experimental findings krupka and serne 2002 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 previous studies also found that as v and sb v could be the major or even exclusive valence state in such soils debiec andrzejewska et al 2020 mitsunobu et al 2006 zhao et al 2022 considering that no redox transformation occurred the reason for the mobilization of as by charcoal enrichment can be further explained by the well established theory of metalloid im mobilization competition between inorganic ash components for soil binding sites electrostatic repulsion and dissolved organic carbon release are all potential causes ahmad et al 2017 bandara et al 2020 wang et al 2022b 2021 batch extraction tests also yielded consistent conclusions fig s6 however conventional mechanisms cannot explain why clay enriched overburden released less as although direct adsorption does occur between as and montmorillonite in aqueous media manning and goldberg 1996 ren et al 2014 few studies have successfully used this amendment for as immobilization in the soil environment previous summarizing reviews suggested that direct adsorption of metal loid s onto soil amendments may have only played a second role as compared with indirect immobilization processes as induced by an altered soil physicochemical environment following amendment such as ph change surface potential change etc bolan et al 2014 palansooriya et al 2020 xu et al 2017 therefore we ve further explored the immobilization performances via well established batch leaching tests suited for soil firstly ζ potential of clay enriched soil was not significantly different from that of the original soil p 0 05 suggesting that electrostatic repulsion did not affect leaching patterns fig 5c secondly batch leaching with water i e chinese hj557 method and acetic acid i e tclp method suggested that montmorillonite clay should theoretically stimulate rather than inhibit as leaching fig s6 the tclp leaching method is the most popular approach for assessing metal loid immobilization performances worldwide and its leachate concentration is often regarded as an indicator of rainfall induced metal loid release from a contaminated site hou et al 2021 tsang et al 2013 yang et al 2022 similarly the hj557 leaching method uses water to simulate natural rainwater which is widely adopted by remediation practitioners to assess whether contaminated surficial soils pose a risk to groundwater when metal loid s are leached during rainfall events gu et al 2017 pan et al 2019 yang et al 2020 however results from this study suggested that both methods may not be suitable for simulating natural leaching processes in the vadose zone it was observed that aggregation characteristics instead of other physicochemical properties of the clay enriched overburden accounted for the inhibition of as release during this non equilibrium leaching process unlike soil texture that reveals the size distribution of all single particles fig s7 soil aggregation describes the natural phenomenon of sand silt and clay particles forming stable clusters in soil brady and weil 2017 soil aggregates are classified as macroaggregates 0 25 mm and microaggregates 0 25 mm brady and weil 2017 in batch extraction experiments such as tclp and hj557 water leaching soil aggregates were broken down during vigorous shaking with the extractant in contrast water passed soil pores gently during a column leaching test thus preserving the natural structure of soil aggregates therefore different soil aggregation behaviors result in different as release patterns from column leaching the present study found that clay enriched soils contained more microaggregates p 0 05 than pristine soils resulting in lower mean weight diameter mwd value p 0 05 fig s8 particularly microaggregates with diameters ranging from 0 053 0 075 mm increased p 0 05 while those with diameter below 0 053 mm slightly decreased fig 5d some scholars believed that soil clusters with diameters less than 0 053 mm should no longer be regarded as aggregates since single particles of clay and silt dominate and the ecological function of aggregates would cease to exist gentry et al 2021 yılmaz et al 2019 our results suggested that although the enrichment of montmorillonite clay increased the proportion of microaggregates a healthy soil structure remained in contrast charcoal enrichment significantly increased the proportion of macroaggregates resulting in a higher mwd value p 0 05 fig s8 the formation of more microaggregates directly contributed to the reduction of as leaching as fine aggregates with high specific surface areas possessed higher adsorption capacity for soil contaminants han et al 2018 however this protection was diminished for sb which can be more rapidly detached from the contaminated overburden fig 5b although the sb leachate concentration peaked later than the original soil and charcoal enriched soil clay enriched soil sequentially increased sb mobility after 20 pore volumes of leaching fig 5b previous works often neglected the crucial role of soil geophysical properties particularly aggregation on metalloid leaching limited literature data reporting aggregation plus soil metalloid leaching were collected and analyzed fig 5ef evidently a decrease in mwd was accompanied by a decrease in the proportion of macroaggregates p 0 001 r2 0 477 during which the labile fraction of metal loid s also tended to decrease fig 5e organic matter enriched soils tended to have increased mwd while mineral enrichment in soil often led to decreased mwd fig 5f this was probably because external organic matter input favored the agglomeration of fine soil particles annabi et al 2007 hou et al 2022 2020b however conflicting results were observed from some studies that the formation of larger aggregates favored metal loid immobilization and decreased plant bioaccumulation in agricultural soils ma et al 2022 tang et al 2022 other mechanisms including increased soil ph increased plant biomass and increased cation exchange capacity may be responsible for this phenomenon direct evidence for different soil aggregation patterns in particles trapped within the fracture was also investigated via fesem eds fig 3c f different aggregation characteristics were found in trapped soil particles clay enriched soil possessed fine aggregates with ordered spherical structures fig 3c while charcoal enriched soil showed a more irregular morphology fig 3e both montmorillonite clay with high na content and charcoal with high c content mixed well with soil particles with high si content fig 3df likewise the former revealed a much smoother spherical morphology which was possibly due to the swelling nature of clay minerals fernández ugalde et al 2013 tambach et al 2004 while the latter exhibited a flaked morphology 3 3 environmental implications results from this study show that rapid migration of contaminants along fractured rock vadose zones does occur posing a threat to drinking water safety although it is usually found that groundwater contamination by as and sb usually originate from the dissolution of metalloid bearing aquifer sediments as the geogenic origin in porous aquifers bolan et al 2022 podgorski and berg 2020 it should be noted that vertical migration of contaminated overburden originated as and sb to groundwater may also be a key process in fractured rock aquifers such as karst region in southwest china fang et al 2021 fu et al 2016 fractured rock aquifers are well known to be contaminated across different environmental media including soil groundwater and surface water which adds much difficulty to pollution mapping and remediation kalhor et al 2019 worse still unregulated discharge of heavy metal loid contaminated industrial wastewater in fractured rock aquifers frequently causes ecological disasters in such region e g the shocking pollution accident of longjiang river in china zhang et al 2017 once contaminated it is very hard to remediate a fractured aquifer using existing strategies compared with the as and sb contaminated soil overburden that can be easily remediated via chemical stabilization komárek et al 2013 okkenhaug et al 2016 conventional groundwater remediation strategies such as pump treat may not perform well in fractured rock because the presence of highly heterogeneous and anisotropic pathways leading to low connectivity epa 1997 other remediation methods proven to be effective for voc removal in fractured aquifers including enhanced in situ bioremediation pérez de mora et al 2014 and in situ chemical oxidation tunnicliffe and thomson 2004 are not suitable for metalloid remediation considering the high vulnerability of contamination and high difficulty of remediation future works should further develop effective in situ remediation strategies towards metalloids in fractured rock aquifers previous research interest in solute transport has focused on porous aquifers conventional convection dispersion equations have been applied in a number of studies to assess the risks of contaminant migration in porous vadose and saturated zones brusseau and rao 1990 frippiat and holeyman 2008 padilla et al 1999 in contrast only limited attempts have focused on contaminant migration in fractured rock aquifers modeling solute transport within fractured rocks is much more complex than in homogeneous porous media where fracture shapes renu and suresh kumar 2017 solute rock interactions hu et al 2022 and film flow zhou et al 2021 need to be properly described results from this study suggested that trapping of soil particles released from the overburden is an important process that affects metalloid leaching patterns future modeling and risk assessment of contaminant transport in fractured rock aquifers should take this trapping phenomenon into account however one should note that the effect of fracture filling material are not investigated via this method because the resin column obtained by 3d printing does not contain any fracture filling materials which are normally found in fractures of natural rocks to overcome this a substantial advancement of 3d printing technique is necessary so that natural rock powders instead of resin polymer can be used for 3d printing in future the thin porous overburden in karst regions also shortens the infiltration time of the water flow shifting contaminant leaching patterns from equilibrium to non equilibrium due to the slow desorption of certain elements such as as in this case previous studies have found non equilibrium transport of organic contaminants in the vadose zone where fluctuations in groundwater table and atmospheric pressure are both potential causes qi et al 2021 when it comes to heavy metals and metalloids that only involves solid liquid partition within the soil porous media the inherently slow desorption kinetics of elements from the solid phase to pore water led to this non equilibrium nature which should be further explored results from this study suggested that aggregation characteristics of the overburden affect the risks associated with metalloid leaching enrichment of the original soil with only 5 montmorillonite clay greatly inhibited as leaching suggesting that aquifers where clay rich soils acted as the porous overburden may be less risky than those with a coarse textured overburden in comparison an aquifer with overburden rich in organic matter may increase the risk of as and sb leaching particularly in remote karst forests with organic soils as the naturally formed overburden chang et al 2018 risks associated with metalloid leaching must not be overlooked 4 conclusion in this study 3d printing was successfully used in combination with ct scanning to obtain a set of reproducible fractures to investigate contaminant transport in fractured rock aquifers column leaching studies were used to simulate the natural process of as and sb leaching from surficial soil along the fractured rock vadose zone during rainfall events the thin porous overburden led to non equilibrium transport of metalloids although the fracture itself exhibited little sorption effect towards metal loid s it still greatly affected the leaching patterns of metalloids because fine soil particles trapped within the crack can serve as filters of the coming flow leading to fluctuation of leachate metalloid concentrations aggregation characteristics of the overburden greatly affects as but had limited impact on sb leaching with charcoal enriched

15365,fractured rock aquifers are susceptible to contamination with metal loid s rapidly migrating from poorly developed overburden to the fractured rock vadose zone and thus into groundwater compared to typical porous aquifers retention effects within the rock matrix are small and rapid advection along fractures leads to a higher risk of groundwater contamination however the highly complex anisotropic pathways of natural fractures hinder research in this field to construct reproducible fractures this study used 3d printing following computed x ray microtomography μct scans of a fractured rock collected in a natural limestone aquifer stimulated metalloid release was observed in the fractured rock during column leaching and the leachate concentrations of arsenic as and antimony sb increased by up to 17 5 and 36 4 times respectively compared with the porous vadose zone fluctuations in fracture metalloid release patterns in dissolved and adsorbed phases were attributed to retention and filtration effects induced by soil particles within fractures geophysical properties of the porous overburden especially the aggregation characteristics greatly affected the non equilibrium leaching behavior of as but had a limited effect on the near equilibrium leaching of sb which was explored by modifying the surficial soil layer with either montmorillonite clay or charcoal the results of this study provide a novel method and useful information for modeling and risk assessment of fractured rock aquifers graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

earth providing drinking water to billions of people around the world de graaf et al 2019 famiglietti 2014 however 97 of this valuable resource is non renewable on centennial timescales and is highly susceptible and difficult to recover once polluted abbott et al 2019 porous aquifers have been a hotspot of groundwater research for decades the rest i e fractured fissured rock aquifers like carbonates tight sandstones and consolidated volcanic rocks are much less explored despite their ubiquitous in more than 120 countries such aquifers spread over one fifth of the country s total area e g 22 for china 25 for usa and 33 for germany igrac 2020 although less explored risks associated with contaminant transport are expected to increase in fractured rock aquifers in porous aquifers contaminants adsorb to fine soil particles such as silt and clay in the unsaturated zone i e the vadose zone limiting their vertical penetration into the saturated zone radcliffe and simunek 2018 this is why in most cases heavy metals with high partition coefficients in the overburden do not cause groundwater pollution in porous aquifers dong et al 2009 uddh söderberg et al 2019 however a few evidences have shown that in regions where fractured rock aquifer are developed contaminants may migrate vertically from source zones to groundwater with subsequent horizontal movement and contamination of large areas compared with small contaminated zones in the surficial soil hartmann et al 2021 kalhor et al 2019 low contaminant retention in the rock matrix and rapid groundwater flow along fissures that favor advection are potential causes jarvie et al 2014 schiperski et al 2016 note that rapid flow can also occur in porous media known as the preferential flow where water and solute pass through certain pathways while bypassing a fraction of porous soil matrix the preferential flow phenomenon can originate from the soil surface following incipient ponding during rainfall events clothier et al 2007 orozco lópez et al 2018 bulk density and macroporosity of the soil particles are main influencing factors clothier et al 2007 in this manuscript however rapid flow within rock fissures instead of soil particles is investigated a main challenge in the experimental study of contaminant transport in fractured rock is the desktop model design unlike porous media where highly reproducible experiments can be made by adding quartz sand or soil particles of known texture to the column fracture formation is highly case specific several studies have used field collected fractured rocks to study contaminant transport characteristics but an inherent obstacle to this approach is the use of different unreproducible fractured rock cores in each treatment group arnon et al 2005 chen et al 2010 the unreproducible nature of fractured rock aquifer studies greatly hinders experimental and modeling explorations in this field additionally most existing studies have only investigated transport processes of artificially spiked contaminants in saturated fractured rocks ignoring the crucial role of the historically contaminated overburden itself as a source of contaminants take metal loid s as an example historical mining and other industrial activities have led to their accumulation in thin surficial soil layer in karst regions gao et al 2022 hou et al 2020a wang et al 2022a during rainfall events metal loid s will be leached into the shallow porous vadose zone below the contaminated soil and eventually into the fractured rock aquifer qin et al 2021 different leaching characteristics from the porous overburden will result in different migration patterns across fractures in this context this study explores the leaching patterns of metalloids i e as and sb in a historically contaminated soil across the fractured rock vadose zone computed x ray microtomography μct scanning and 3d printing were used to obtain reproducible fractures above which a clean soil layer and a contaminated source zone were placed as the porous overburden in this novel column leaching study design migration mechanisms of metalloids in fractures was further explored finally the contaminated surficial soil was enriched with charcoal or montmorillonite to investigate whether the geophysical properties of the overburden affected metalloid leaching through the underlying fractures 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental design four polymethyl methacrylate leaching columns were set up of which three experimental groups were 3d printed fractured rock vadose zones and one control group contained only porous vadose zones fig 1 3d printed fractured rock vadose zone a cylindrical fractured rock core 9 cm in diameter 50 cm in length was collected in a fractured limestone aquifer with a rock auger at a sampling depth of 32 7 m after that the rock sample was selected and scanned using a μct nanovoxel 5000 sanying precision instruments co ltd china a cylindrical part of the scanned model 3 cm in diameter 5 cm in length containing fracture was further used to obtain the reconstructed 3d model scanning was conducted at 300 kv with a square pixel density of 3072 3072 the resolution of μct scanning was 0 0035 cm the porosity of the rock n f r a c t u r e was determined to be 5 46 the aperture of the fracture within the rock ranged from 0 016 to 0 239 cm with an average aperture of 0 063 cm this value was comparable to previously reported values for fractured rock aquifers cohen et al 2019 kaufmann et al 2019 valsala and govindarajan 2018 the model was then 3d printed isla1900d zrapid tech china using transparent resin see table s1 for detailed properties the resolution of the 3d printer was 0 01 cm which was lower than the narrowest aperture allowing precise printing of fractured rock clean porous vadose zone uncontaminated soil was collected in a park ground and sieved 2 mm iso 2006 soil properties are provided in table 1 the sieved soil was packed above the printed fracture after pre roughening the sidewall of the column to avoid preferential pathway nylon mesh 75 μm was used to separate this layer from the fractured zone the dry packing method was used with an increment of 0 2 cm to assure homogeneity lewis and sjöstrom 2010 the bulk density of the porous vadose zone was set to 1 10 g cm 3 soil porosity was calculated to be 0 585 contaminated overburden historically contaminated soils were collected in southwest china historical mining activities since the 1950s have resulted in as and sb contamination of large areas of shallow poorly developed surficial soil layer he et al 2012 zhan et al 2021 worse still both elements are negatively charged oxyanions in natural soil also negatively charged rendering higher mobility compared to metal cations such as cd and pb alloway 2012 the contaminated soil was also sieved below 2 mm after that either montmorillonite a 2 1 clay mineral obtained from macklin co ltd 95

value for soil amendment chen et al 2018 yang et al 2017 the porous morphology and the carbon rich nature of charcoal were observed fig s1 along with a thermal conversion induced formation of crystalline sio2 cristobalite fig s2 which is a distinct feature of rice husk derived charcoal li and delvaux 2019 shen et al 2014 the x ray diffraction xrd and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir absorption peaks of montmorillonite also confirmed the high purity of this clay mineral fig s2 fig s3 after 21 days of short term incubation at water content 30 wt historically contaminated soil ct montmorillonite enriched historically contaminated soil mont and charcoal enriched historically contaminated soil char were packed onto the clean porous vadose zone following the same packing method and bulk density nylon mesh 75 μm was used to separate this layer from the clean soil vadose zone deionized water was injected continuously into each column at 0 236 ml min 1 this value was identical to a typical soil infiltration rate during rainfall events i e 20 mm h 1 fao 1985 a thin quartz sand layer 1 cm was placed above the contaminated soil to assure uniform infiltration two sampling ports located at the bottom port a and within the middle of the fracture port b were set up leachate was collected every 4 h at two different sampling ports in the fracture columns and one sampling port at the bottom of the column where the 3d printed fractured rock vadose zone was replaced by clean soil as the porous medium the leaching experiment was conducted continuously for 120 h leachates were passed through 0 22 μm pes filter and analyzed further for as and sb concentrations an additional leaching test was also conducted for the fracture alone to explore the migration mechanism of metalloids the fracture volume fv was calculated as follows eq 1 1 f v n f r a c t u r e v f r a c t u r e 1 93 m l where v f r a c t u r e is the total volume of the 3d printed fracture the historically contaminated soil was further sieved to below 75 μm which was the size of the nylon mesh used for layer separation in simulated rainfall leaching test the sieved soil was immersed in ultrapure water resistivity 18 2 mω cm at a solid to liquid ratio of 1 20 and subjected to sonication for 2 5 h theoretically the time required to simulate rainwater passing through the contaminated layer the suspension was then added directly to the 3d printed fracture 5 fvs each time i e 9 65 ml a total of 50 fvs crossed the fracture in 10 cycles after each cycle metalloid concentrations in the dissolved phase after passing through 0 22 μm pes filter and the total metalloid concentration in the leachate after adding hno3 and hcl with volume ratio 2 1 to dissolve solids were detected the turbidity of the leachate suspension was measured and reported after a 100 fold dilution the desorption kinetics of as and sb in historically contaminated soil were also investigated at a solid to liquid ratio of 1 1 4 calculated from the soil porosity ultrapure water was used as the extractant samples were taken and centrifuged at 10 min 30 min 1 h 2 h 4 h 8 h 20 h 32 h and 44 h the liquid phase was filtered 0 22 μm prior to as and sb concentration measurements a first order desorption model was used to describe this process eq 2 3 azizian and bashiri 2008 li 1999 2 d c d t k c e c t 3

soil montmorillonite enriched soil and charcoal enriched soil before and after leaching this method has been widely used by previous works to investigate the fractions of these two elements garau et

error bars 3 results and discussion 3 1 accelerated migration in fractured rock vadose zone a sharp increase in leachate as and sb concentrations was observed for column 2 with a fractured rock vadose zone fig 2 a b as the concentrations in columns 1 and 2 were not significantly different p 0 05 at the initial 1 8 pvs this suggests that the thin porous overburden in the upper 5 cm successfully retained this metalloid for both columns after that however the as concentration increased sharply by a factor of 17 5 at 16 4 pvs suggesting that the fractured rock vadose zone failed to trap as compared to the lower 5 cm thin porous vadose zone in column 1 fig 2a antimony concentration increased more rapidly in the initial stage up to 36 4 times at 1 8 pvs and then decreased steadily fig 2b as was successfully retained in porous column 1 throughout the leaching experiment of 27 pore volumes in contrast sb was leached in the porous column after the initial 5 pore volumes fig 2b although in a much milder manner with a lower maximum leachate sb concentration i e 1118 μg l 1 compared to the fractured column i e 1705 μg l 1 different leaching patterns for as and sb may lie in the different desorption kinetics in soil fig 2d sb desorbed rapidly k 15 55 h 1 while as desorbed slowly k 7 39 h 1 it took 20 h for as to reach 80 of the total released mass in the final stage i e 44 h while it only took 10 min for sb to achieve this hence a near equilibrium transport of sb was expected 2 5 h through each porous soil layer during which sb in the surficial soil was rapidly leached into the pore water in contrast as underwent non equilibrium transport and could not be completely desorbed from the soil solid matrix into the porous medium resulting in a concentration in pore water that was much lower than the ideal equilibrium transport process two unique phenomena were observed during leaching with simulated rainfall 1 soil particles were trapped within the fracture fig 3 a b 2 a fluctuation in leachate turbidity was found fig s9 considering that the fracture matrix itself exhibited little retention of both metalloids fig 2c it was proposed that particles trapped in the fracture may have contributed to a different transport mechanism as compared with diffusion and convection processes in porous media previous works also suggested that colloid facilitated transport contributed substantially to the transport of strongly retained contaminants löv et al 2018 šimůnek et al 2006 therefore an additional transport study simulating the worst case scenario of metalloid transport due to overburden soil loss was conducted to investigate the trapping phenomenon of the fracture itself and its effects on metalloid migration fig 4 fine soil particles 75 μm were sonicated for 2 5 h then a suspension of 5 fvs was added to the fracture containing 0 48 g soil particle it was found that a small mass proportion of overburden soil entering the fracture caused the entrapment of soil particles fig 4a d where four different stages were found firstly in the initial 5 fvs soil particles blocked the fracture exit in clusters at the bottom while the clean zone still existed fig 4a note that the dissolved as and sb concentrations were the lowest fig 4e secondly at 10 fvs film like trapping was observed within the crack fig 4b leading to much lower leachate turbidity and higher dissolved and total metalloid concentrations in the leachate fig 4ef an elevated leachate metalloid concentration suggested that the shift from cluster like trapping stage 1 to film like trapping stage 2 tended to diminish the retardation effect of soil particles within the fracture thirdly at 35 fvs cluster like trapping reappeared with a more potent retardation effect compared to stage 1 fig 4c an elevated metalloid concentration in the dissolved phase was accompanied by a sharp decrease in total metal concentrations fig 4ef suggesting that soil particles trapped in this stage acted in a manner similar to that of a porous medium in which the inflowing water must be filtered by this contaminated layer of fine particles during this filtration process both turbidity and total metalloid concentration in the leachate sharply decreased due to particle retention while as and sb were desorbed from the trapped fine particles into the liquid phase resulting in an increase in the metalloid concentration in the dissolved phase finally at 50 fvs the maximum soil holding capacity was reached as evidenced by the release of weakly retained soil particles fig 4d with elevated turbidity decreased metalloid concentrations in the dissolved phase and increased total metalloid concentration observed fig 4ef an important finding is that colloid facilitated transport instead of direct transport of truly dissolved phase dominated metalloid leaching in this case as evidenced by the fact that the leachate concentration of dissolved phase only accounted for 0 5 1 5 and 1 0 3 3 of the total leached concentration of as and sb respectively fig 4ef the findings align well with previous findings that colloid facilitated transport contributed a major role for strongly retained contaminants in the vadose zone bin et al 2011 šimůnek et al 2006 some evidence has shown that the fast flow of contaminants in the saturated zone occurs in regions where fractured rock aquifers develop for instance schiperski et al 2016 found that uranine and polystyrene colloids transported rapidly at a velocity of 36 9 m h 1 in a karst aquifer with little retention another study by hartmann et al 2021 found that up to 50 of infiltrated glyphosate can reach groundwater table in carbonate rock aquifers while this value decreased sharply below 1 in porous aquifers colloid facilitated transport of herbicides i e atrazine and bromacil were observed by james et al 2022 during which contaminant sorption onto soil organic matter is the dominant process determining its mobility in terms of heavy metals and metalloids evidence from a superfund site suggested that the fractured bedrock aquifer served as preferential horizontal transport pathways of cd cu and zn from groundwater to a creek caruso and dawson 2009 colloid facilitated transport were also reported where the adsorption behavior of metalloids is a key factor affecting this process on the one hand the high adsorption capacity of soil matrix to retain metalloids highlights the primary role of colloid facilitated transport in such aquifers because the solution concentration of metalloids in pore water would be very small flury and qiu 2008 grolimund and borkovec 2005 on the other hand strong adsorption capacity of the colloid itself account for stimulated metalloid leaching for instance ferrihydrite colloids can facilitate as leaching substantially due to the strong adsorption of as to fe bearing minerals gomez gonzalez et al 2018 ma et al 2018 organic colloids were reported to stimulate both as and sb leaching because of the high affinity for the sorption of both elements macgregor et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 in this study it is found that rapid leaching also occurs in the vadose zone during simulated rainfall events two reasons account for this phenomenon first almost no adsorption was found in fractured rocks compared to porous media with high specific surface areas hendrickx and flury 2001 sahimi 2011 second soil formation is much slower in fractured rock aquifers e g karst coxon 2011 yan et al 2019 often leading to thin porous overburden that cannot effectively retain contaminants leached from the topsoil this is because karst aquifers lack the primary source of soil formation i e the insoluble residual material derived from bedrock weathering which typically constitutes less than 10 of parent limestone rock boyer 2003 a typical value of 10 cm hu et al 2020 li et al 2014 was selected for the surficial thin soil layer in this study which failed to retain metal loid indicating an elevated risk of metal loid migration to groundwater 3 2 effects of overburden characteristics on metalloid leaching throughout the leaching experiment the clay rich overburden decreased as leaching across the fractured rock vadose zone up to 96 5 at 4 5 pore volumes while the charcoal rich one dramatically stimulated as leaching by up to 32 5 times at 2 7 pore volumes fig 5 a in terms of sb leaching the overburden type had limited effect fig 5b geochemical fractions of as and sb for different treatment groups were shown in fig s5 charcoal enrichment significantly increased the proportion of the most labile form of as namely the non specifically bound form as compared with the unamended soil p 0 001 suggesting that a mobilization effect should theoretically occur montmorillonite clay amendment also increased the proportion of non specifically bound as although not statistically significant p 0 131 for both elements the geochemical fraction bound with al and fe hydrous oxides account for a large pool which is due to the fact that as and sb have high affinity towards metal oxides to form co precipitates or inner sphere complexes alloway 2012 komárek et al 2013 vithanage et al 2013 it is notable that in this historically contaminated soil the residual fraction of as and sb account for the largest pool despite the amendment type this is due to the natural long term aging process of metalloids in the soil environment which have gradually altered the labile forms into non labile ones han et al 2021 quazi et al 2010 the mobility of as and sb are also highly dependent on their valence state the mobility of as iii is higher than as v pigna et al 2015 in contrast sb iii are more strongly sorbed to soil matrix therefore less labile as compared with sb v due to its neutral characteristic over a wide ph range okkenhaug et al 2016 the chemical speciation of soil as and sb across all treatment groups and the unamended soil were exclusively as v and sb v suggesting a highly oxidized nature of the soil it is primary because the historically contaminated soils either amended or unamended possess a near neutral ph along with a high eh value table 1 in such conditions the speciation of these metalloids in the environment should theoretically be as v and sb v which aligns well with the experimental findings krupka and serne 2002 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 previous studies also found that as v and sb v could be the major or even exclusive valence state in such soils debiec andrzejewska et al 2020 mitsunobu et al 2006 zhao et al 2022 considering that no redox transformation occurred the reason for the mobilization of as by charcoal enrichment can be further explained by the well established theory of metalloid im mobilization competition between inorganic ash components for soil binding sites electrostatic repulsion and dissolved organic carbon release are all potential causes ahmad et al 2017 bandara et al 2020 wang et al 2022b 2021 batch extraction tests also yielded consistent conclusions fig s6 however conventional mechanisms cannot explain why clay enriched overburden released less as although direct adsorption does occur between as and montmorillonite in aqueous media manning and goldberg 1996 ren et al 2014 few studies have successfully used this amendment for as immobilization in the soil environment previous summarizing reviews suggested that direct adsorption of metal loid s onto soil amendments may have only played a second role as compared with indirect immobilization processes as induced by an altered soil physicochemical environment following amendment such as ph change surface potential change etc bolan et al 2014 palansooriya et al 2020 xu et al 2017 therefore we ve further explored the immobilization performances via well established batch leaching tests suited for soil firstly ζ potential of clay enriched soil was not significantly different from that of the original soil p 0 05 suggesting that electrostatic repulsion did not affect leaching patterns fig 5c secondly batch leaching with water i e chinese hj557 method and acetic acid i e tclp method suggested that montmorillonite clay should theoretically stimulate rather than inhibit as leaching fig s6 the tclp leaching method is the most popular approach for assessing metal loid immobilization performances worldwide and its leachate concentration is often regarded as an indicator of rainfall induced metal loid release from a contaminated site hou et al 2021 tsang et al 2013 yang et al 2022 similarly the hj557 leaching method uses water to simulate natural rainwater which is widely adopted by remediation practitioners to assess whether contaminated surficial soils pose a risk to groundwater when metal loid s are leached during rainfall events gu et al 2017 pan et al 2019 yang et al 2020 however results from this study suggested that both methods may not be suitable for simulating natural leaching processes in the vadose zone it was observed that aggregation characteristics instead of other physicochemical properties of the clay enriched overburden accounted for the inhibition of as release during this non equilibrium leaching process unlike soil texture that reveals the size distribution of all single particles fig s7 soil aggregation describes the natural phenomenon of sand silt and clay particles forming stable clusters in soil brady and weil 2017 soil aggregates are classified as macroaggregates 0 25 mm and microaggregates 0 25 mm brady and weil 2017 in batch extraction experiments such as tclp and hj557 water leaching soil aggregates were broken down during vigorous shaking with the extractant in contrast water passed soil pores gently during a column leaching test thus preserving the natural structure of soil aggregates therefore different soil aggregation behaviors result in different as release patterns from column leaching the present study found that clay enriched soils contained more microaggregates p 0 05 than pristine soils resulting in lower mean weight diameter mwd value p 0 05 fig s8 particularly microaggregates with diameters ranging from 0 053 0 075 mm increased p 0 05 while those with diameter below 0 053 mm slightly decreased fig 5d some scholars believed that soil clusters with diameters less than 0 053 mm should no longer be regarded as aggregates since single particles of clay and silt dominate and the ecological function of aggregates would cease to exist gentry et al 2021 yılmaz et al 2019 our results suggested that although the enrichment of montmorillonite clay increased the proportion of microaggregates a healthy soil structure remained in contrast charcoal enrichment significantly increased the proportion of macroaggregates resulting in a higher mwd value p 0 05 fig s8 the formation of more microaggregates directly contributed to the reduction of as leaching as fine aggregates with high specific surface areas possessed higher adsorption capacity for soil contaminants han et al 2018 however this protection was diminished for sb which can be more rapidly detached from the contaminated overburden fig 5b although the sb leachate concentration peaked later than the original soil and charcoal enriched soil clay enriched soil sequentially increased sb mobility after 20 pore volumes of leaching fig 5b previous works often neglected the crucial role of soil geophysical properties particularly aggregation on metalloid leaching limited literature data reporting aggregation plus soil metalloid leaching were collected and analyzed fig 5ef evidently a decrease in mwd was accompanied by a decrease in the proportion of macroaggregates p 0 001 r2 0 477 during which the labile fraction of metal loid s also tended to decrease fig 5e organic matter enriched soils tended to have increased mwd while mineral enrichment in soil often led to decreased mwd fig 5f this was probably because external organic matter input favored the agglomeration of fine soil particles annabi et al 2007 hou et al 2022 2020b however conflicting results were observed from some studies that the formation of larger aggregates favored metal loid immobilization and decreased plant bioaccumulation in agricultural soils ma et al 2022 tang et al 2022 other mechanisms including increased soil ph increased plant biomass and increased cation exchange capacity may be responsible for this phenomenon direct evidence for different soil aggregation patterns in particles trapped within the fracture was also investigated via fesem eds fig 3c f different aggregation characteristics were found in trapped soil particles clay enriched soil possessed fine aggregates with ordered spherical structures fig 3c while charcoal enriched soil showed a more irregular morphology fig 3e both montmorillonite clay with high na content and charcoal with high c content mixed well with soil particles with high si content fig 3df likewise the former revealed a much smoother spherical morphology which was possibly due to the swelling nature of clay minerals fernández ugalde et al 2013 tambach et al 2004 while the latter exhibited a flaked morphology 3 3 environmental implications results from this study show that rapid migration of contaminants along fractured rock vadose zones does occur posing a threat to drinking water safety although it is usually found that groundwater contamination by as and sb usually originate from the dissolution of metalloid bearing aquifer sediments as the geogenic origin in porous aquifers bolan et al 2022 podgorski and berg 2020 it should be noted that vertical migration of contaminated overburden originated as and sb to groundwater may also be a key process in fractured rock aquifers such as karst region in southwest china fang et al 2021 fu et al 2016 fractured rock aquifers are well known to be contaminated across different environmental media including soil groundwater and surface water which adds much difficulty to pollution mapping and remediation kalhor et al 2019 worse still unregulated discharge of heavy metal loid contaminated industrial wastewater in fractured rock aquifers frequently causes ecological disasters in such region e g the shocking pollution accident of longjiang river in china zhang et al 2017 once contaminated it is very hard to remediate a fractured aquifer using existing strategies compared with the as and sb contaminated soil overburden that can be easily remediated via chemical stabilization komárek et al 2013 okkenhaug et al 2016 conventional groundwater remediation strategies such as pump treat may not perform well in fractured rock because the presence of highly heterogeneous and anisotropic pathways leading to low connectivity epa 1997 other remediation methods proven to be effective for voc removal in fractured aquifers including enhanced in situ bioremediation pérez de mora et al 2014 and in situ chemical oxidation tunnicliffe and thomson 2004 are not suitable for metalloid remediation considering the high vulnerability of contamination and high difficulty of remediation future works should further develop effective in situ remediation strategies towards metalloids in fractured rock aquifers previous research interest in solute transport has focused on porous aquifers conventional convection dispersion equations have been applied in a number of studies to assess the risks of contaminant migration in porous vadose and saturated zones brusseau and rao 1990 frippiat and holeyman 2008 padilla et al 1999 in contrast only limited attempts have focused on contaminant migration in fractured rock aquifers modeling solute transport within fractured rocks is much more complex than in homogeneous porous media where fracture shapes renu and suresh kumar 2017 solute rock interactions hu et al 2022 and film flow zhou et al 2021 need to be properly described results from this study suggested that trapping of soil particles released from the overburden is an important process that affects metalloid leaching patterns future modeling and risk assessment of contaminant transport in fractured rock aquifers should take this trapping phenomenon into account however one should note that the effect of fracture filling material are not investigated via this method because the resin column obtained by 3d printing does not contain any fracture filling materials which are normally found in fractures of natural rocks to overcome this a substantial advancement of 3d printing technique is necessary so that natural rock powders instead of resin polymer can be used for 3d printing in future the thin porous overburden in karst regions also shortens the infiltration time of the water flow shifting contaminant leaching patterns from equilibrium to non equilibrium due to the slow desorption of certain elements such as as in this case previous studies have found non equilibrium transport of organic contaminants in the vadose zone where fluctuations in groundwater table and atmospheric pressure are both potential causes qi et al 2021 when it comes to heavy metals and metalloids that only involves solid liquid partition within the soil porous media the inherently slow desorption kinetics of elements from the solid phase to pore water led to this non equilibrium nature which should be further explored results from this study suggested that aggregation characteristics of the overburden affect the risks associated with metalloid leaching enrichment of the original soil with only 5 montmorillonite clay greatly inhibited as leaching suggesting that aquifers where clay rich soils acted as the porous overburden may be less risky than those with a coarse textured overburden in comparison an aquifer with overburden rich in organic matter may increase the risk of as and sb leaching particularly in remote karst forests with organic soils as the naturally formed overburden chang et al 2018 risks associated with metalloid leaching must not be overlooked 4 conclusion in this study 3d printing was successfully used in combination with ct scanning to obtain a set of reproducible fractures to investigate contaminant transport in fractured rock aquifers column leaching studies were used to simulate the natural process of as and sb leaching from surficial soil along the fractured rock vadose zone during rainfall events the thin porous overburden led to non equilibrium transport of metalloids although the fracture itself exhibited little sorption effect towards metal loid s it still greatly affected the leaching patterns of metalloids because fine soil particles trapped within the crack can serve as filters of the coming flow leading to fluctuation of leachate metalloid concentrations aggregation characteristics of the overburden greatly affects as but had limited impact on sb leaching with charcoal enriched overburdens posing an elevated risk of as migration declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

process the adsorption capacity of pac should be assessed which requires highly sophisticated instruments such as tandem mass spectrometry with high performance liquid chromatographical separation hplc ms ms to analyze the trace concentrations of omps bunting et al 2021 however the instrument is costly and needs professional operation and long measurement time a cost effective and convenient method should be developed to estimate the adsorption capacity of pac within a very short time the uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 is often used as a sum parameter to indicate the total content of aromatic substances in water a linear correlation between the abatement of uv254 and omps has been reported altmann et al 2014 anumol et al 2015 korshin et al 2018 li et al 2020 müller et al 2019 streicher et al 2016 therefore the adsorption of omps could be estimated by measuring the abatement of uv254 usually a batch adsorption test is conducted which typically requires 25 60 min contact time altmann et al 2014 kårelid et al 2017 mailler et al 2015 in this work a quick test method has been developed with a strongly reduced adsorption time of 45 s that is much short than conventional batch tests the shorter contact times was compensated by higher pac dosages the adsorption behavior of 14 frequently detected omps were compared in 4 water samples from a wwtp effluent and concentrations of individual omps uv254 and dissolved organic fractions were analyzed this study provides a very convenient and quick method to predict the adsorption capacity of pacs for removing omps 2 material and methods 2 1 materials and wastewater samples the pac pulsorb wp 235 was provided by chemviron ltd germany its bet specific surface area was 1075 m2 g including 724 m2 g surface area of micropores with a pore volume of 0 49 cm³ g and average pore diameter of 1 8 nm aschermann et al 2019 the syringe filter made from regenerated cellulose was provided by macherey nagel gmbh co kg germany and it had a pore size of 0 45 μm and a filter diameter of 25 mm the wastewater samples were collected from wwtp ruhleben in berlin between mid april and the beginning of june the samples were filtrated with membrane cellulose nitrate pore size of 0 45 µm and kept at 4 c before adsorption tests a set of 14 frequently detected omps was selected including some of the european voluntary

samples b c and d were applied for quick tests since the samples were not taken at the same time their characteristics and omp concentrations slightly varied 2 3 batch adsorption test the batch tests were conducted in 100 ml bottles containing 50 ml wastewater the pac dosages and contact times were set as 5 35 mg l and 5 90 min respectively a concentrated pac suspension 2 g l was used to dose specific amounts of pac into the batches during the adsorption tests the bottles were covered and shaken at a rotating speed of 100 rpm under ambient temperature the samples were filtrated after the defined contact time by membrane filters cellulose nitrate pore size of 0 45 µm which had been pre washed with 50 ml ultra pure water after filtration the omp concentrations and uv254 were subsequently analyzed to estimate the adsorption equilibrium state batch tests with contact times of 24 h and 48 h were conducted 2 4 quick adsorption test the quick test was conducted in two steps as shown in fig 1 in the preparation step the syringe filter was loaded with pac by filtering different volumes 10 ml of the pac suspension 2 g l the pac loaded syringe filter was subsequently dried overnight at 105 c by the defined loading different pac dosages 85 885 mg l were achieved for 20 ml of water samples in the operation step 20 ml wastewater sample was quickly loaded 15 s through the prepared syringe filter into the syringe and all pac also moved with the wastewater into the syringe where the sufficient contact of omps with pac took place after 30 s the sample was filtrated back in 15 s across the same syringe filter the adsorption time was defined as 45 s excluding the loading time the filtrate was collected for further analyses three series of quick adsorption tests were conducted for wastewater samples b c and d 2 5 analyses the concentrations of omps were quantifed by hplc ms ms with a 2 5 µm xselect hss t3 column 50 2 1 mm water usa and a tsq vantage electrospray ionization thermo fisher scientific usa the analysis and quantification methods were described in more detail previously dittmar et al 2018 uv254 was determined with a uv vis spectrophotometer lambda 12 perkin elmer germany dom was characterized through lcocd doc labor huber germany using a hw50s column toyopearl japan and the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc in samples have been detected by the lcocd huber et al 2011 ruhl et al 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of omps and uv254 in batch adsorption tests increasing the pac dosage from 5 to 35 mg l or the adsorption time from 5 to 90 min can clearly enhance the abatement of uv254 and total omps σomps with conventional batch tests as shown in fig 2 these investigated pac dosages and contact time conform to the conditions of real treatment condition by which the pac adsorption is mostly between 25 and 60 min with the dosage of pac in the range of 2 5 to 50 mg l altmann et al 2016a p 254 kårelid et al 2017 mailler et al 2015 uv254 was removed to a lower extent than σomp at same conditions since the humic acids building blocks and low molecular weight neutrals which also contribute to uv254 were not well adsorbed onto pac guillossou et al 2020a individual omps showed different adsorption behaviors as indicated in fig 3 the adsorption time and the dosage of pac also significantly influenced the adsorption of all omps except gab whose removal was limited and varied in a narrow range 3 20 some omps were quickly adsorbed while others not their adsorbability can be classified according to their removals with 30 mg l pac in 45 min into 3 groups good 80 medium 50 80 and poor 50 as presented in table 2 similar results were also obtained in the study of schwaller et al 2021 the adsorption of omps was connected with their partition coefficients log kow corresponding to hydrophobicity dominated charge molecular weight and minimal projection area the mtp cbz bta and vlx showed good adsorbability in this work since they are characterized with comparably higher partition coefficient 1 44 it was in accordance with the finding of altmann et al 2016b that the omps with aromatic structure and higher hydrophobicity were preferentially adsorbed by pac in this work the pac had a point of zero charge phpzc at 9 4 and was slightly positive charged on its surface at neutral ph aschermann et al 2019 the wwtp effluents contain dom parts of which are negatively charged at neutral ph according to alves et al 2018 the surface of pac might be negatively charged by adsorbed dom inducing a strong electrostatic attraction of positive charged omps thus dcf val and vsa although having log kow values of 1 83 4 02 might be influenced from their negative charges and finally was less adsorbed onto pac in addition the pac had many tiny pores mean size 18 å and then the omp with lower projection area was more favorite to be adsorbed into micropores guillossou et al 2020b thus atn with a lower projection area 41 53 å² than vlx 55 8 å² was adsorbed more on pac guillossou et al 2020b lazar et al 2015 the molecular weight might also influence the adsorption of omps onto pac a slightly higher adsorption has been found for the omps with a low molecular weight alves et al 2018 in this work bta is among the omps with the lowest molecular weight 119 13 g mol although it has middle log kow 1 44 a high removal of 91 at the given condition was observed in addition the adsorption efficiency was influenced by the initial concentrations of omps the atn and bzf were classified as medium adsorbable omp in previous study schwaller et al 2021 however possibly owing to low initial concentrations 0 60 and 0 21 μg l in the feed sample they were highly removed by pac in this work previous studies have found a strong relation between the abatement of uv254 and the removal of omps up to 80 omps removals zietzschmann et al 2014a thus uv254 seems to be a useful indicator to predict the adsorption of omps onto pac in this study we tested the influence of potentially different adsorption kinetics of omps and uv254 absorbing constituents by comparing the abatements of uv254 with removals of the total and individual omps with different adsorption times 30 45 and 60 min and pac dosages 5 35 mg l in steps of 5 mg l as shown in fig 4 a good linearity r2 0 98 occurred between the removal of uv254 and that of σomp some individual omps also obtained a good linearity with uv254 including cbz dcf vlx and faa r2 0 95 but atn val and gab showed weak correlation coefficients r2 0 90 mtp was quickly adsorbed on pac as shown in fig 3 and removals by most pac dosages were higher than 90 it can also be found that the slope of most regressed lines in fig 4 were larger than one except that of gab 0 62 a slope greater than 1 means that the removals of total or single omps were higher than the corresponding abatement of uv254 due to the lower adsorption of humic acids building blocks and low molecular weight neutrals as mentioned above the low slope value of gab in fig 4 might mainly come from its extremely weak adsorbability 3 2 removal of omps and uv254 in quick adsorption tests the removals of uv254 and σomp for the different pac dosages are shown in fig 5 three series of quick tests were conducted with wastewater samples b c and d several pac dosages 85 175 255 355 435 510 595 690 and 885 mg l were prepared while the adsorption time was fixed at 45 s in accordance with the batch tests the abatements of uv254 were lower than the removals of σomps it indicates that the quick adsorption with much higher pac dosage 85 885 mg l might prefer the removals of omps over dom which is usually the main component of uv254 the relation between the abatements of uv254 and the removal of omps are given in fig 6 a good linearity r2 0 98 occurred between the abatement of uv254 and that of σomp some individual omps also obtained a good linearity with uv254 including faa vsa bta cbz vlx and gab r2 0 95 but bzf iop and val showed weak correlation coefficients r2 0 90 it might be related to low initial concentrations the concentrations of bzf ranged from 0 03 to 0 06 μg l in wastewater effluents and the removals strongly variated in the quick tests even at identical pac dosages it can be found that the slopes of most regressed lines in fig 6 were lower than their corresponding values obtained in conventional batch tests fig 4 it indicates that compared with batch test method lower removals of omps were achieved with the quick test method at same uv254 abatement owing to the large pac dosages compensating short adsorption times the adsorption selectivity of omps was decreased consequently promoting the removal of less adsorbable omps such as vsa and gab 3 3 the removal of dom fractions with both methods depending on the elution time on lcocd fig 7 c dom could be divided into and classified as biopolymers humics building blocks acids and neutrals haberkamp et al 2007 huber et al 2011 zietzschmann et al 2014b these doms were composited by various hydrophobic and hydrophilic compounds with wide molecular sizes compared with omps ng l to μg l the concentration of dom in effluent is much higher initial doc at 9 06 12 00 mg l dom contributes to adsorption competition for omps onto activated carbon to clarify the changes of dom fractions in wastewater during both adsorption methods the water samples were analyzed with lcocd as shown in fig 7 the lcocd chromatogram almost kept stable during 90 min of the batch adsorption with 20 mg l pac and the portions of acids and biopolymers were slightly dropped down by contrast the quick adsorption clearly decreased the chromatogram especially with high pac dosages 355 and 690 mg l but the biopolymer section did not change based on the area ratios of each dom fraction under the chromatographic curve fig 7c and the measured doc of the water sample doc of each dom fraction was calculated in order to clarify their adsorption shanmuganathan et al 2015 the adsorption capacities of dom fractions in batch tests were higher than quick tests table 3 possibly due to the low dosage of pac as shown in fig 8 the whole dom of wastewater was gradually dropped down along the adsorption in the batch test with 20 mg l pac dosage after 48 h 15 6 of dom was removed among the dom fractions neutrals and acids were preferably removed with removals of 23 0 and 19 5 respectively while only 9 2 of humics was removed the removals of the organic fractions followed the order 1 neutrals 2 acids 3 building blocks 4 humics and 5 biopolymers for the quick adsorption test the pac dosages varied from 85 mg l to 885 mg l with a fixed adsorption time 45 s as illustrated in fig 9 when more pac was dosed the removal of dom was significantly enhanced 16 9 for 85 mg l pac vs 45 6 for 885 mg l pac neutrals and acids were also preferably removed which was similar with the batch tests since both methods used the same adsorbent while the removal of building blocks was promoted with the quick test the low molecular organic fractions of acids and neutrals could be adsorbed onto internal sites of pac while dom constituents with higher molecular weight might be adsorbed on the external surface shutova et al 2020 since the contact time was only 45 s the neutrals and acids could not be rapidly transferred into the internal surface of pac meanwhile the negatively charged building blocks interacted with the positive charged pac cai et al 2020 thus the removal of building block was higher than that of acids at most pac dosages the adsorbed dom fractions per gram of pac defined as loading on pac was also calculated with a lower dosage of pac and a longer adsorption time it is expected that the batch adsorption reaches higher loadings of dom fractions than the quick adsorption table 3 in the quick adsorption where more pac was applied at the same adsorption time 45 s the loading of each dom fractions decreased accordingly owing to different initial concentrations of organic fractions in the feed the order of loading capacities was differently followed 1 neutrals 2 humics 3 building blocks 4 acids and 5 biopolymer with both adsorption methods table 3 which conforms to the order of their partition coefficients from the amount adsorbed per solution concentration in previous study jamil et al 2019 3 4 correlation between quick tests and batch tests 3 4 1 uv254 and omps as illustrated above both batch and quick tests resulted in a comparable pattern of uv254 abatements and omp removals the abatements of uv254 for different pac dosages in both methods is shown in fig 10 a in the batch tests a linear relation existed between the uv254 abatement and the applied pac dosages 5 35 mg l for all studied adsorption times 30 45 60 min the correlation between uv254 and pac dosage showed linear in the quick tests with pac dosage from 85 mg l to 510 mg l by collating the uv254 abatements of both methods in fig 10b a strong linear correlation can be found r2 0 99 demonstrating the feasibility of transferring the results between each other the removal of the sum of omps and individual omps in both adsorption tests is compared in fig 11 the removal of σomp showed a good linearity while the correlation of the removals of individual omps varied atn and val were correlated with the lowest linearity their correlation coefficients were in the range of 0 650 0 805 and 0 840 0 908 for different adsorption times respectively while cbz vlx and iom showed the best linearity r2 0 950 for all tests when comparing the correlations of omps between different adsorption times 30 45 60 min one can find that most omps had a better linearity for 60 min except mtp dcf and iop 3 4 2 predicting the removal of omps in batch tests from the quick tests as shown in fig 10b the abatement of uv254 in batch tests can be accurately predicted from the data obtained in quick tests especially for a given adsorption time in batch tests e g 60 min the removals of the sum and individual omps in batch tests could be predicted from the calculated uv254 data with the models in fig 4 similarly when the removals of omps are obtained in the quick test the removal of total and individual omps in batch tests can also be predicted according to the models in fig 11 fig 12 compares the measured removals of omps in batch tests with the calculated data from the abatement of uv254 data fig 12a or the removal of omps fig 12b the removal of σomps was predicted with the highest accuracy as expected from fig 4 and 6 most of the data of individual omps are located in the zone of 95 confidence along the diagonal line except val and bzf half data points of val and atn were outside the 95 confidence zone compared with uv254 the omps data showed a slightly better accuracy for predicting the removal of omps in batch tests fig s1 presents the removal of individual and total omps in the conventional batch tests from the real measurement or from the prediction based on the uv254 or omps data in quick tests it was found that the removals of σomp bta dcf faa iop gab and vsa in batch tests can be predicted with a high accuracy from both their uv254 data and omps data in quick tests while cbz vlx bzf pri and iom were predicted with a better accuracy from the their omps data than their uv254 data however the model from uv254 removal is more practical for most wwtps since the hplc ms ms is not required 4 conclusion in this work a quick method was developed to assess the adsorption of omps onto pac and its performance was compared with conventional batch tests regarding the adsorption of 14 frequently detected omps uv254 and dom fractions from the effluents of a local wwtp with varying dosages of pac and adsorption times conventional batch tests revealed that the adsorptive removal of omps were significantly dependent on their hydrophobicity molecular size ionic status minimal projection area and initial concentrations the correlation between the removal of omps and that of uv254 followed the same pattern in both quick and conventional methods strongly correlated for total omps r2 0 95 but weakly for several individual omps possibly due to the interference with dom both methods also resulted in the same preference on the removal of dom fractions 1 neutrals 2 humics 3 building blocks 4 acids and 5 biopolymer from the removal data of uv254 and omps obtained with the quick method the corresponding removals can be estimated for the conventional batch test with a high accuracy for most omps except those whose adsorption was extremely slow e g gab or extremely fast val in general the quick test can replace conventional batch test to save much

omps e g kow molecular weight polarity functional group dittmann et al 2022 streicher et al 2016 omps with aromatic structures and higher hydrophobicity have been reported to be preferentially adsorbed by pac altmann et al 2016b it was estimated that a dosage of 1 5 3 g pac per gram of dom can sufficiently remove most omps in wwtp effluents rout et al 2021 to design and operate a pac process the adsorption capacity of pac should be assessed which requires highly sophisticated instruments such as tandem mass spectrometry with high performance liquid chromatographical separation hplc ms ms to analyze the trace concentrations of omps bunting et al 2021 however the instrument is costly and needs professional operation and long measurement time a cost effective and convenient method should be developed to estimate the adsorption capacity of pac within a very short time the uv absorbance at 254 nm uv254 is often used as a sum parameter to indicate the total content of aromatic substances in water a linear correlation between the abatement of uv254 and omps has been reported altmann et al 2014 anumol et al 2015 korshin et al 2018 li et al 2020 müller et al 2019 streicher et al 2016 therefore the adsorption of omps could be estimated by measuring the abatement of uv254 usually a batch adsorption test is conducted which typically requires 25 60 min contact time altmann et al 2014 kårelid et al 2017 mailler et al 2015 in this work a quick test method has been developed with a strongly reduced adsorption time of 45 s that is much short than conventional batch tests the shorter contact times was compensated by higher pac dosages the adsorption behavior of 14 frequently detected omps were compared in 4 water samples from a wwtp effluent and concentrations of individual omps uv254 and dissolved organic fractions were analyzed this study provides a very convenient and quick method to predict the adsorption capacity of pacs for removing omps 2 material and methods 2 1 materials and wastewater samples the pac pulsorb wp 235 was provided by chemviron ltd germany its bet specific surface area was 1075 m2 g including 724 m2 g surface area of micropores with a pore volume of 0 49 cm³ g and average pore diameter of 1 8 nm aschermann et al 2019 the syringe filter made from regenerated cellulose was provided by macherey nagel gmbh co kg germany and it had a pore size of 0 45 μm and a filter diameter of 25 mm the wastewater samples were collected from wwtp ruhleben in berlin between mid april and the beginning of june the samples were filtrated with membrane cellulose nitrate pore size of 0 45 µm and kept at 4 c before adsorption tests a set of 14 frequently detected omps was selected including some of the european voluntary groundwater watch list v 3 1 diclofenac dcf 4 formylaminoantipyrin faa valsartan val carbamazepine cbz gabapentin gab primidone pri atenolol atn metoprolol mtp iomeprol iom bezafibrate bzf benzotriazole bta and valsartan acid vsa plus venlafaxine vlx and iopromide iop concentrations in the wastewater samples a b c d are shown in table 1 the sample a has been utilized in batch tests the samples b c and d were applied for quick tests since the samples were not taken at the same time their characteristics and omp concentrations slightly varied 2 3 batch adsorption test the batch tests were conducted in 100 ml bottles containing 50 ml wastewater the pac dosages and contact times were set as 5 35 mg l and 5 90 min respectively a concentrated pac suspension 2 g l was used to dose specific amounts of pac into the batches during the adsorption tests the bottles were covered and shaken at a rotating speed of 100 rpm under ambient temperature the samples were filtrated after the defined contact time by membrane filters cellulose nitrate pore size of 0 45 µm which had been pre washed with 50 ml ultra pure water after filtration the omp concentrations and uv254 were subsequently analyzed to estimate the adsorption equilibrium state batch tests with contact times of 24 h and 48 h were conducted 2 4 quick adsorption test the quick test was conducted in two steps as shown in fig 1 in the preparation step the syringe filter was loaded with pac by filtering different volumes 10 ml of the pac suspension 2 g l the pac loaded syringe filter was subsequently dried overnight at 105 c by the defined loading different pac dosages 85 885 mg l were achieved for 20 ml of water samples in the operation step 20 ml wastewater sample was quickly loaded 15 s through the prepared syringe filter into the syringe and all pac also moved with the wastewater into the syringe where the sufficient contact of omps with pac took place after 30 s the sample was filtrated back in 15 s across the same syringe filter the adsorption time was defined as 45 s excluding the loading time the filtrate was collected for further analyses three series of quick adsorption tests were conducted for wastewater samples b c and d 2 5 analyses the concentrations of omps were quantifed by hplc ms ms with a 2 5 µm xselect hss t3 column 50 2 1 mm water usa and a tsq vantage electrospray ionization thermo fisher scientific usa the analysis and quantification methods were described in more detail previously dittmar et al 2018 uv254 was determined with a uv vis spectrophotometer lambda 12 perkin elmer germany dom was characterized through lcocd doc labor huber germany using a hw50s column toyopearl japan and the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc in samples have been detected by the lcocd huber et al 2011 ruhl et al 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of omps and uv254 in batch adsorption tests increasing the pac dosage from 5 to 35 mg l or the adsorption time from 5 to 90 min can clearly enhance the abatement of uv254 and total omps σomps with conventional batch tests as shown in fig 2 these investigated pac dosages and contact time conform to the conditions of real treatment condition by which the pac adsorption is mostly between 25 and 60 min with the dosage of pac in the range of 2 5 to 50 mg l altmann et al 2016a p 254 kårelid et al 2017 mailler et al 2015 uv254 was removed to a lower extent than σomp at same conditions since the humic acids building blocks and low molecular weight neutrals which also contribute to uv254 were not well adsorbed onto pac guillossou et al 2020a individual omps showed different adsorption behaviors as indicated in fig 3 the adsorption time and the dosage of pac also significantly influenced the adsorption of all omps except gab whose removal was limited and varied in a narrow range 3 20 some omps were quickly adsorbed while others not their adsorbability can be classified according to their removals with 30 mg l pac in 45 min into 3 groups good 80 medium 50 80 and poor 50 as presented in table 2 similar results were also obtained in the study of schwaller et al 2021 the adsorption of omps was connected with their partition coefficients log kow corresponding to hydrophobicity dominated charge molecular weight and minimal projection area the mtp cbz bta and vlx showed good adsorbability in this work since they are characterized with comparably higher partition coefficient 1 44 it was in accordance with the finding of altmann et al 2016b that the omps with aromatic structure and higher hydrophobicity were preferentially adsorbed by pac in this work the pac had a point of zero charge phpzc at 9 4 and was slightly positive charged on its surface at neutral ph aschermann et al 2019 the wwtp effluents contain dom parts of which are negatively charged at neutral ph according to alves et al 2018 the surface of pac might be negatively charged by adsorbed dom inducing a strong electrostatic attraction of positive charged omps thus dcf val and vsa although having log kow values of 1 83 4 02 might be influenced from their negative charges and finally was less adsorbed onto pac in addition the pac had many tiny pores mean size 18 å and then the omp with lower projection area was more favorite to be adsorbed into micropores guillossou et al 2020b thus atn with a lower projection area 41 53 å² than vlx 55 8 å² was adsorbed more on pac guillossou et al 2020b lazar et al 2015 the molecular weight might also influence the adsorption of omps onto pac a slightly higher adsorption has been found for the omps with a low molecular weight alves et al 2018 in this work bta is among the omps with the lowest molecular weight 119 13 g mol although it has middle log kow 1 44 a high removal of 91 at the given condition was observed in addition the adsorption efficiency was influenced by the initial concentrations of omps the atn and bzf were classified as medium adsorbable omp in previous study schwaller et al 2021 however possibly owing to low initial concentrations 0 60 and 0 21 μg l in the feed sample they were highly removed by pac in this work previous studies have found a strong relation between the abatement of uv254 and the removal of omps up to 80 omps removals zietzschmann et al 2014a thus uv254 seems to be a useful indicator to predict the adsorption of omps onto pac in this study we tested the influence of potentially different adsorption kinetics of omps and uv254 absorbing constituents by comparing the abatements of uv254 with removals of the total and individual omps with different adsorption times 30 45 and 60 min and pac dosages 5 35 mg l in steps of 5 mg l as shown in fig 4 a good linearity r2 0 98 occurred between the removal of uv254 and that of σomp some individual omps also obtained a good linearity with uv254 including cbz dcf vlx and faa r2 0 95 but atn val and gab showed weak correlation coefficients r2 0 90 mtp was quickly adsorbed on pac as shown in fig 3 and removals by most pac dosages were higher than 90 it can also be found that the slope of most regressed lines in fig 4 were larger than one except that of gab 0 62 a slope greater than 1 means that the removals of total or single omps were higher than the corresponding abatement of uv254 due to the lower adsorption of humic acids building blocks and low molecular weight neutrals as mentioned above the low slope value of gab in fig 4 might mainly come from its extremely weak adsorbability 3 2 removal of omps and uv254 in quick adsorption tests the removals of uv254 and σomp for the different pac dosages are shown in fig 5 three series of quick tests were conducted with wastewater samples b c and d several pac dosages 85 175 255 355 435 510 595 690 and 885 mg l were prepared while the adsorption time was fixed at 45 s in accordance with the batch tests the abatements of uv254 were lower than the removals of σomps it indicates that the quick adsorption with much higher pac dosage 85 885 mg l might prefer the removals of omps over dom which is usually the main component of uv254 the relation between the abatements of uv254 and the removal of omps are given in fig 6 a good linearity r2 0 98 occurred between the abatement of uv254 and that of σomp some individual omps also obtained a good linearity with uv254 including faa vsa bta cbz vlx and gab r2 0 95 but bzf iop and val showed weak correlation coefficients r2 0 90 it might be related to low initial concentrations the concentrations of bzf ranged from 0 03 to 0 06 μg l in wastewater effluents and the removals strongly variated in the quick tests even at identical pac dosages it can be found that the slopes of most regressed lines in fig 6 were lower than their corresponding values obtained in conventional batch tests fig 4 it indicates that compared with batch test method lower removals of omps were achieved with the quick test method at same uv254 abatement owing to the large pac dosages compensating short adsorption times the adsorption selectivity of omps was decreased consequently promoting the removal of less adsorbable omps such as vsa and gab 3 3 the removal of dom fractions with both methods depending on the elution time on lcocd fig 7 c dom could be divided into and classified as biopolymers humics building blocks acids and neutrals haberkamp et al 2007 huber et al 2011 zietzschmann et al 2014b these doms were composited by various hydrophobic and hydrophilic compounds with wide molecular sizes compared with omps ng l to μg l the concentration of dom in effluent is much higher initial doc at 9 06 12 00 mg l dom contributes to adsorption competition for omps onto activated carbon to clarify the changes of dom fractions in wastewater during both adsorption methods the water samples were analyzed with lcocd as shown in fig 7 the lcocd chromatogram almost kept stable during 90 min of the batch adsorption with 20 mg l pac and the portions of acids and biopolymers were slightly dropped down by contrast the quick adsorption clearly decreased the chromatogram especially with high pac dosages 355 and 690 mg l but the biopolymer section did not change based on the area ratios of each dom fraction under the chromatographic curve fig 7c and the measured doc of the water sample doc of each dom fraction was calculated in order to clarify their adsorption shanmuganathan et al 2015 the adsorption capacities of dom fractions in batch tests were higher than quick tests table 3 possibly due to the low dosage of pac as shown in fig 8 the whole dom of wastewater was gradually dropped down along the adsorption in the batch test with 20 mg l pac dosage after 48 h 15 6 of dom was removed among the dom fractions neutrals and acids were preferably removed with removals of 23 0 and 19 5 respectively while only 9 2 of humics was removed the removals of the organic fractions followed the order 1 neutrals 2 acids 3 building blocks 4 humics and 5 biopolymers for the quick adsorption test the pac dosages varied from 85 mg l to 885 mg l with a fixed adsorption time 45 s as illustrated in fig 9 when more pac was dosed the removal of dom was significantly enhanced 16 9 for 85 mg l pac vs 45 6 for 885 mg l pac neutrals and acids were also preferably removed which was similar with the batch tests since both methods used the same adsorbent while the removal of building blocks was promoted with the quick test the low molecular organic fractions of acids and neutrals could be adsorbed onto internal sites of pac while dom constituents with higher molecular weight might be adsorbed on the external surface shutova et al 2020 since the contact time was only 45 s the neutrals and acids could not be rapidly transferred into the internal surface of pac meanwhile the negatively charged building blocks interacted with the positive charged pac cai et al 2020 thus the removal of building block was higher than that of acids at most pac dosages the adsorbed dom fractions per gram of pac defined as loading on pac was also calculated with a lower dosage of pac and a longer adsorption time it is expected that the batch adsorption reaches higher loadings of dom fractions than the quick adsorption table 3 in the quick adsorption where more pac was applied at the same adsorption time 45 s the loading of each dom fractions decreased accordingly owing to different initial concentrations of organic fractions in the feed the order of loading capacities was differently followed 1 neutrals 2 humics 3 building blocks 4 acids and 5 biopolymer with both adsorption methods table 3 which conforms to the order of their partition coefficients from the amount adsorbed per solution concentration in previous study jamil et al 2019 3 4 correlation between quick tests and batch tests 3 4 1 uv254 and omps as illustrated above both batch and quick tests resulted in a comparable pattern of uv254 abatements and omp removals the abatements of uv254 for different pac dosages in both methods is shown in fig 10 a in the batch tests a linear relation existed between the uv254 abatement and the applied pac dosages 5 35 mg l for all studied adsorption times 30 45 60 min the correlation between uv254 and pac dosage showed linear in the quick tests with pac dosage from 85 mg l to 510 mg l by collating the uv254 abatements of both methods in fig 10b a strong linear correlation can be found r2 0 99 demonstrating the feasibility of transferring the results between each other the removal of the sum of omps and individual omps in both adsorption tests is compared in fig 11 the removal of σomp showed a good linearity while the correlation of the removals of individual omps varied atn and val were correlated with the lowest linearity their correlation coefficients were in the range of 0 650 0 805 and 0 840 0 908 for different adsorption times respectively while cbz vlx and iom showed the best linearity r2 0 950 for all tests when comparing the correlations of omps between different adsorption times 30 45 60 min one can find that most omps had a better linearity for 60 min except mtp dcf and iop 3 4 2 predicting the removal of omps in batch tests from the quick tests as shown in fig 10b the abatement of uv254 in batch tests can be accurately predicted from the data obtained in quick tests especially for a given adsorption time in batch tests e g 60 min the removals of the sum and individual omps in batch tests could be predicted from the calculated uv254 data with the models in fig 4 similarly when the removals of omps are obtained in the quick test the removal of total and individual omps in batch tests can also be predicted according to the models in fig 11 fig 12 compares the measured removals of omps in batch tests with the calculated data from the abatement of uv254 data fig 12a or the removal of omps fig 12b the removal of σomps was predicted with the highest accuracy as expected from fig 4 and 6 most of the data of individual omps are located in the zone of 95 confidence along the diagonal line except val and bzf half data points of val and atn were outside the 95 confidence zone compared with uv254 the omps data showed a slightly better accuracy for predicting the removal of omps in batch tests fig s1 presents the removal of individual and total omps in the conventional batch tests from the real measurement or from the prediction based on the uv254 or omps data in quick tests it was found that the removals of σomp bta dcf faa iop gab and vsa in batch tests can be predicted with a high accuracy from both their uv254 data and omps data in quick tests while cbz vlx bzf pri and iom were predicted with a better accuracy from the their omps data than their uv254 data however the model from uv254 removal is more practical for most wwtps since the hplc ms ms is not required 4 conclusion in this work a quick method was developed to assess the adsorption of omps onto pac and its performance was compared with conventional batch tests regarding the adsorption of 14 frequently detected omps uv254 and dom fractions from the effluents of a local wwtp with varying dosages of pac and adsorption times conventional batch tests revealed that the adsorptive removal of omps were significantly dependent on their hydrophobicity molecular size ionic status minimal projection area and initial concentrations the correlation between the removal of omps and that of uv254 followed the same pattern in both quick and conventional methods strongly correlated for total omps r2 0 95 but weakly for several individual omps possibly due to the interference with dom both methods also resulted in the same preference on the removal of dom fractions 1 neutrals 2 humics 3 building blocks 4 acids and 5 biopolymer from the removal data of uv254 and omps obtained with the quick method the corresponding removals can be estimated for the conventional batch test with a high accuracy for most omps except those whose adsorption was extremely slow e g gab or extremely fast val in general the quick test can replace conventional batch test to save much time e g at the delivery of a new pac batch this study provides an efficient and simple method for the operators and researchers to monitor the adsorption quality of pac products declaration of

15367,constructed wetlands cws integrated with sulfur autotrophic denitrification to stimulate high rate nitrogen removal from carbon limited wastewater holds particular application prospect due to no excessive carbon source addition high efficiency and good stability in this study we conducted elemental sulfur based constructed wetland scw and traditional constructed wetland cw under different c n 2 1 and 0 5 to explore the feasibility and mechanisms for nitrogen removal from low c n wastewater compared with cw scw was demonstrated more robust in nitrogen removal in the case of low c n influent when the influent c n control was at 0 5 scw observed total nitrogen tn and nitrate removal efficiency of 69 36 3 96 and 81 71 3 96 with the corresponding removal rate of 1 18 0 66 and 1 70 0 92 g n m 2 d 1 which were 2 11 and 10 03 times of cw respectively the nitrate removal rate constant k in the scw was 1 05 3 83 and 10 33 times higher than the cw with c n of 2 1 and 0 5 furthermore 14 40 54 51 and 79 82 of nitrogen were removed by the sulfur autotrophic denitrification sad in scw which also contributed 43 89 73 68 and 71 70 of sulfate production moreover the combined system of cw scw is proved be an efficient operation mode for simultaneously removing total ammonia nitrogen tan and nitrate in the scw the richness of the microbial community was improved and sulfur oxidizing genera e g thiobacillus sulfurimonas was selectively enriched which affect the performance the elemental sulfur based denitrification process the nitrate reduction pathway was overwhelmed by denitrification and the dissimilatory nitrate reduction process these findings offer elemental sulfur based autotrophic denitrification constructed wetland has excellent potential to enhance nitrogen removal from carbon limited wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sulfur autotrophic denitrification constructed wetlands nitrogen removal low c n nitrogen and sulfur cycle data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrogen discharge without deep treatment from carbon limited wastewater such as agriculture drainage slightly polluted river water aquaculture wastewaters and secondary effluents from the wastewater treatment plant is the primary cause of water ecosystem security li et al 2021 wu et al 2013 many freshwater lakes in china such as taihu lake chaohu lake and poyang lake are facing severe problems such as eutrophication and the decline in surface water quality guo et al 2019 generally nitrate removal is the main stumble block for these carbon limited wastewaters purification advanced technologies such as electrodialysis ion exchange catalytic oxidation reverse osmosis etc for nitrate advanced polishing from the carbon limited wastewaters quite efficiently however they are often cost prohibitive liu et al 2020b moreover traditional biological nitrification denitrification always inefficient when treated wastewater lacking electron donors bezbaruah and zhang 2003 therefore it is necessary to develop optimal technologies to realize high nitrogen removal performance from carbon limited wastewaters constructed wetlands cws is a promising eco technology due to its low construction cost simple maintenance and environmentally friendliness which has been widely used for nitrogen removal from various wastewaters flores et al 2019 wu et al 2015 in general heterotrophic denitrification is the primary removal pathway for nitrate in traditional cws and the availability of a carbon source for biological denitrification is the main limiting factor it was shown that the carbon source provided only from the root exudates was not enough for nitrogen removal gagnon et al 2007 heterotrophic denitrification requires sufficient carbon sources as electron donors however the accurate addition of the carbon source is difficult wang et al 2009 and excessive organic carbon addition such as methanol sodium acetate and glucose will lead to secondary pollution and high costs lu et al 2009 xu et al 2018 meanwhile the hydraulic conductivity will weaken the sludge produced by heterotrophic nitrification and denitrification furthermore the continuous accumulation of pollutants and secretion of extracellular polymers from microorganisms will also cause wetland clogging du et al 2016 zhang et al 2012 because of inefficient nitrogen removal in cws for the carbon limited wastewater disposal it is imperative to address the problems associated with nitrogen removal in cws under low carbon to nitrogen c n mass ratio influent conditions element sulfur s0 is readily available as a less toxic and low cost form of sulfur that is used as an electron donor acceptor in two main types of bioprocesses i e s0 autotrophic denitrification s0ad and s0 reducing organics removal s0or guo et al 2022 researchers also have found that sulfur autotrophic denitrification sad is an alternative technology to improve nitrogen removal efficiency wang et al 2021 it can avoid the increase of biological sludge production nitrous oxide n2o accumulation and emission owing to excessive carbon source addition and potential generation of toxic compounds due to the chlorination process yang et al 2016 zhou et al 2011 sad has been widely used in low c n wastewater treatment c n 3 such as groundwater drinking water urban sewage aquaculture effluent and industrial wastewater hu et al 2020 huang et al 2019 some studies had been reported that it could achieve high nitrate removal performance form the micro polluted wastewater such as agriculture drainage aquaculture wastewaters and secondary effluents as s0 was added into cws for example the average nitrate removal efficiency was 96 10 in a vertical flow constructed wetland using s0 limestone zeolite and volcanic rock with a volume ratio of 1 1 1 1 as substrates about 1 2 of c n wang et al 2020 however it was mainly concentrated on nitrogen enhancement performance sulfur source selection and operation parameter optimization in s0 based constructed wetland scw at present bezbaruah and zhang 2003 li et al 2021 wang et al 2020 the quantitative parameters for nitrogen transformation dynamics and mechanism and byproduct composition while s0 added are still limited it is unknown whether it will cause excessive sulfur source consumption and byproducts production in this study three parallel scw and traditionally cw were constructed and operated under three different c n 2 1 and 0 5 and hrts 1 d 2 d and 3 d the cw scw combined operation mode was conducted to simultaneous enhance the nitrate and total ammonia nitrogen tan removal the objectives of this study were 1 to evaluate the nitrogen removal performance of scw under low c n operation conditions 2 to investigate the nitrogen transformation dynamics mechanism and fate of nitrogen in scw 3 to quantify the contribution of nitrogen removal pathway and byproducts formation based on s0 4 to analyze microbial community and nitrogen metabolism mechanisms in scw in addition this study will provide technical support for cw using s0 as substrates for nitrogen removal from carbon limited wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 construction and operation of experimental cw microcosms the laboratory established three groups of identical cylindrical cw and scw

range test at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrogen removal performance fig 1 and fig s2 showed the performance of tn tan nitrate and nitrite removed in cw and scw during the four stages compared with cw superior tn and nitrate removal efficiencies were observed in scw during all the operation stages the effluent nitrogen concentration of scw was below 10 mg l 1 under all operating conditions however the scw appeared to have a lower tan removal efficiency during stage i to stage iii 3 1 1 tn removal for the tn removal performance fig 1a and fig 1d significant within group differences p 0 05 were all observed between scw and cw with the average removal rate of 1 53 g n m 2 d 1 and 1 02 g n m 2 d 1 with the corresponding removal efficiencies were 73 83 and 47 82 respectively however it was noticeable that there was no significant difference between scw 70 87 8 49 and cw 71 16 9 87 at stage i p 0 05 which might be attributed to stronger heterotrophic denitrification with sufficient carbon source c n 2 which consistent with the previous study fu et al 2022 moreover it was also shown that carbon sources will be preferentially used as the electron donor to perform heterotrophic denitrification while it can meet the electron donor requirement guerrero et al 2011 when the constructed wetlands switched to stage ii the influent c n was decreased from 2 to 1 and the average tn removal efficiency of scw was slightly reduced by 68 89 5 93 however the average removal efficiency of cw sharply decreased from 71 16 9 87 to 46 34 3 68 during stage ii due to obstruction of the heterotrophic denitrification process in the low c n conditions the stronger resistance to influent with lower c n 0 5 was found in scw as c n decreased the average removal efficiency of scw can still keep at 69 36 3 97 with a corresponding average tn removal rate of 1 698 g n m 2 d 1 at stage iii which might be due to effective autotrophic denitrification based on s0 where nitrate was be preferentially used as the reduced electron mediators park et al 2015 most noteworthy is that tn removal efficiencies in scw 85 26 3 07 demonstrated an upward trend in stage iv compared to stage iii as the cw scw combined system enhanced the removal performance of tan fig 1b 3 1 2 tan removal tan removal efficiencies of cw were 75 31 11 77 66 47 7 88 and 68 25 6 13 in stage i to stage iii fig 1b with corresponding removal rates fig 1e of 0 68 0 27 g n m 2 d 1 0 61 0 23 g n m 2 d 1 and 0 65 0 26 g n m 2 d 1 however tan accumulation was observed in all scw groups and the average tan removal efficiencies of scw in stage i to stage iii were observed at 18 23 16 21 and 14 51 lower than in the cw groups respectively the important reason was that s0 oxidation competed with nitrification for do li et al 2020a mccarty et al 1990 also found that reductive sulfur compound is a kind of nitrification inhibitor that can inhibit tan performance in cw mccarty et al 1990 notably the tan accumulation was dramatically alleviated when the two stage constructed wetland series operated during stage iv the average tan removal efficiency in cw scw increased from 53 73 6 13 to 80 83 5 87 with the corresponding tan removal rate of 0 49 0 19 g n m 2 d 1 the cw cw combined system also observed tan removal efficiency of 82 34 4 16 in this stage it is mainly attributed to the increased surface area of constructed wetland systems and an oxygen enriched environment created in the two stage constructed wetland series operation conditions 3 1 3 nitrate removal and nitrite accumulation for the nitrate removal there was no significant difference between scw and cw at stage i p 0 05 due to relatively abundant carbon sources in the influent while a significant difference was observed in terms of nitrate removal fig 1c p 0 05 in stage ii to stage iv scw presented much better nitrate removal efficiency 84 56 5 66 than that of cw 19 97 11 81 that was consistent with the results of other studies with sulfur based autotrophic denitrification technologies zheng et al 2021 during stage ii the average nitrate removal efficiency in scw was 83 04 6 37 with the corresponding nitrate removal rate of 1 24 0 57 g n m 2 d 1 in comparison the cw observed a removal efficiency of 35 08 6 37 and removal rate of 0 58 0 37 g n m 2 d 1 notably when controlling the influent c n at 0 5 the average removal efficiency of scw was maintained at 81 72 5 66 in stage iii and cw scw was observed at 88 59 3 22 in stage iv it was observed at 12 03 5 66 and 13 38 4 44 in the cw and cw cw system respectively these results indicated that at lower c n the majority of nitrogen in scw was removed by autotrophic denitrification fig s2 illustrated that nitrite accumulation was also found in this study even when nitrate concentration was low in scw and cw effluent had a lower nitrite accumulation during the study moreover in scw and cw the nitrite concentration increased as c n decreased the highest nitrite concentration in scw was observed at stage iii at 0 33 0 10 mg l 1 and cw effluent observed an average concentration of 0 23 0 10 mg l 1 during stage iv nitrite accumulation in the two stage constructed wetland s effluent was alleviated compared with day 160 day 180 fig s2d mainly due to more nitrate production conversed from nitrite under a higher do condition of the two stage series operation condition in summary scw can use s0 as an efficient electron donor to perform better n removal and should operate under relatively long hrt to avoid nitrite accumulation 3 2 cod and tp removal performance fig 2 and fig s3 showed cod and tp removal performance in cw and scw during the whole experiment the results demonstrated no significant difference between scw and cw during the four operation stages p 0 05 generally the effluent cod concentration of the scw and cw effluent cod concentration was kept lower than 10 mg l 1 and effluent tp concentration was detected to be lower than 0 30 mg l 1 for the cod scw and cw show gradually increased removal efficiencies from stage i to stage iv scw was observed at 61 90 6 02 67 10 10 21 89 74 9 43 and 88 24 6 68 and cw followed at 57 81 5 96 68 70 8 80 88 81 9 28 and 88 94 8 71 respectively fig 2a which may be due to the low influent cod in stage iii and stage iv fig 2b demonstrates that the cod degradation trend of the cw and scw under the different stages can well fit the first order kinetic model at the initial 36 h sequence batch experiment table s3 illustrated that there was no significant difference between scw and cw of the cod degradation constant p 0 05 due to the relatively small influent cod value in the influent under all operating conditions however the c n also can influence the cod degradation kinetics as the higher c n operation conditions observed a smaller degradation constant for example the scw had k values of 0 021 0 030 and 0 031 h 1 and the cw had k values of 0 028 0 021 and 0 034 h 1 when controlling the influent c n of 2 1 and 0 5 respectively the opposite result was found in the research of the previous study which can be attributed to higher do dang et al 2022 fig 2c illustrated that tp removal performance was kept at a stable level under the different operation conditions for example the scw removal efficiencies of the four different stages slightly fluctuated between 65 95 2 98 and 68 35 4 02 and the cw s removal efficiencies also ranged between 63 89 4 37 and 66 71 4 06 these results demonstrated that the tp removal in cws was dominant by the substrate adsorption and plant uptake coban et al 2015 and the introduction of s0 to the constructed wetland has less impact on the phosphorus removal furthermore the batch degradation experiments fig 2d illustrated that over 50 of phosphorus could be removed within 30 h and subsequent 42 h were kept at stable values which further explains the reason for the phosphorus removal efficiency of the scw and cw can remain a stable state under different c n and hrt operation conditions 3 3 effluent sulfates sulfides and toxicity fig 3 a and b shows the performance of sulfates and sulfides formation in the scw and cw during the whole experiment generally the influent sulfates ranged between 20 76 and 42 71 mg l 1 during the entire investigation the effluent sulfate in cw was kept at a stable level between 35 55 and 66 50 mg l 1 and the average effluent sulfate concentrations in cw showed an increasing trend with the increased hrt 16 19 2 87 16 93 2 67 and 19 09 4 74 mg l 1 with hrt of 1 2 and 3 days the increased sulfate in cw may derive from the leaching of the constructed wetlands substrate such as zeolite gravel etc the effluent sulfates concentration of scw at stage i to stage iv were 67 83 5 11 103 57 11 49 145 33 9 42 and 150 77 5 84 mg l 1 respectively compared with cw the effluent sulfate in scw was not significantly increased compared to cw during stage i as the sulfur autotrophic denitrification process involved in this stage was inhibited however this value increased significantly 55 97 9 21 88 61 3 55 and 100 38 1 62 mg l 1 from stage ii to stage iv as elemental sulfur based autotrophic denitrification dominated to remove of nitrogen in the scw even so the sulfate concentration of scw effluent meets the class v standard of surface water during the whole stage same as the sulfate s formation the sulfides effluent concentration in scw was observed at the lowest average value of 0 37 0 15 mg l 1 during stage i and 0 56 0 21 0 55 0 17 and 0 75 0 20 mg l 1 was detected during stage ii to stage iv these results indicated that the primary sulfide sources in cw are sulfate reduction reaction and sulfur disproportionation reaction wu et al 2011 moreover the effluent sulfide was relatively higher in the long hrt operation conditions as the easily anaerobic environment in the scw for sulfate reduction fig 3b demonstrated the kinetics of sulfate formation under different c n and the results showed that the sulfate leaching in cw completed a relative equilibrium value within 18 h however the relatively equilibrium value of sulfate formation in scw was observed after 36 h proving that the sad process occurred within 36 h the amount of sulfate formation in scw and cw were well fitted with the first order kinetics of products formation δ s u l f a t e c 1 e k t δ s u l f a t e c k and t represent the amount of sulfate formation equilibrium coefficient kinetic constant and reaction time respectively the equilibrium coefficients c of scw were 46 93 2 08 86 02 3 11 and 93 04 4 16 mg l 1 under c n of 2 1 and 0 5 with the corresponding r 2 of 0 962 0 973 and 0 930 respectively table s2 the equilibrium coefficients remained stable 16 34 0 87 17 97 0 67 and 16 54 1 00 under three different c n conditions in cw the above results also showed a significant correlation between sulfate formation and nitrate removal p 0 05 indicating that sad was the primary process for n removal under low c n in scw cecchetti et al 2022 in order to explore the changes of water toxicity in the scw and cw the toxicity test of luminescent bacteria was carried out it could be seen from fig 3c that the inhibition rates of the luminescence kept at a stable level which was slightly ranged from 19 6 2 6 to 21 5 3 9 during the four operation stages generally after the scw and cw treated almost all of the samples detected a downward trend on the inhibition rates of the luminescence which range from 10 8 4 4 to 19 9 1 8 indicating the excellent guarantee of water security there was no significant difference of the inhibition rates between the scw and cw groups as well as the different operation stages moreover a previous study also found that elemental sulfur has lower effect on plant leaves while the pyrite has larger impact on the plant and toxicity li et al 2020a these results can prove that the amount of sulfate or sulfide produced in the scw at this study concentration conditions has little effect on effluent toxicity 3 4 enhanced nitrogen removal in scw fig 4 showed the periodic nitrogen transformation in cw and scw under the different operation conditions the results showed that tn nitrate and tan removal tendencies of cw and scw were fitted to the first order kinetic equations fig 4 and table 1 in the cw tn removal performances were greatly influenced by the influent c n while this influence was weakened in the scw for instance the first order kinetics constants k of scw were 0 018 0 016 and 0 018 h 1 during stage i to stage iii respectively in contrast the k value of cw was significantly reduced from 0 017 to 0 005 as the c n decreased from 2 to 0 5 furthermore the k values of tn in scw were 1 05 2 28 and 3 60 times of cw when the c n were controlled at 2 1 and 0 5 respectively demonstrating the advantages and feasibility of elemental sulfur based constructed wetlands for low c n micro polluted wastewater remediation there was a significant difference between scw and cw on nitrate removal p 0 05 notably the nitrate showed an increasing trend during the first 18 h fig 4c in the cw may be due to the superior nitrification capacity lead the nitrate generation rate being significantly higher than its reduction rate resulting in the accumulation of nitrate the k values of nitrate removal in scw during stage i to stage iii were kept at a stable level 0 037 0 029 and 0 034 h 1 which were about 2 05 4 83 and 11 33 times the cw groups respectively moreover hrt prolonging is negative to nitrate removal under the condition of insufficient carbon sources this also shows that the root exudates alone were insufficient to maintain the heterotrophic nitrogen removal process in traditional cw gagnon et al 2007 these results further explained that s0 based autotrophic denitrification could be employed as an efficient technology for the extremely low c n water remediation as mentioned above for the tan removal fig 4b the primary tan removal process occurred during the first 30 h in both cw and scw however tan removal efficiencies and rates in the scw were lower than those in cw with the decrease of c n the tan removal rates decreased which was consistent with the results observed in the long term experiment moreover the oxygen consumption rates of scw groups were considerably faster than that of cw groups which demonstrated that the poor ammonia nitrogen removal of scw may be due to part of the dissolved oxygen being consumed by the s0 oxidation process li et al 2020a generally as for nitrite accumulation and removal performance there was no apparent correlation between its variation and influent c n the nitrite in scw after three days batch test was significantly higher than that in cw which was consistent with the long term experiment results as an intermediate product nitrite removal increased first and then decreased or maintained balance 0 2 mg l 1 3 5 effect of hrt and c n on nitrogen removal the effects of tn loading rate on nitrogen removal rate were investigated by varying the hrt between 1 day and 3 days fig 5 presented the relationship between nitrogen removal rate and tn loading rate under different c n conditions generally the nitrogen removal rate showed a significant positive correlation with the tn loading rate under almost all the c n operation conditions except tan in cw when the c n was controlled at 0 5 r 2 0 665 0 700 for the scw the slopes of linear equations between tn removal rate and loading rate were 0 531 0 564 and 0 639 when the influent c n were 2 1 and 0 5 respectively which were much higher than the cw 0 515 0 448 and 0 267 respectively the same trend was found in the relationship between nitrate removal rate and tn loading rate these results also demonstrated that scw exhibits a stronger resistance to the high tn loading rate however tan showed an opposite trend in nitrate removal the slopes of the equations between tan removal rate and tn loading rate of cw were more significant than those of scw which was also consistent with the results mentioned above correlation analysis and multiple linear regression were performed to illustrate the relationship between nitrogen tn nitrate and tan removal efficiencies and operating factors such as nitrogen loading rate influent cod and tn concentration and c n table s3 showed that the nitrogen tn nitrate and tan loading rates strongly correlate with the nitrogen removal efficiencies in scw however a significant correlation was observed for the cw between tan removal efficiency and nitrogen load rates it is worth noting that influent cod and c n were significantly correlated with tn and nitrate removal efficiency in cw and the nitrogen removal rate in scw is not affected by influent cod and c n the multi factor linear regression functions between nitrogen removal efficiencies and these significantly correlated operating factors such as nitrogen loading rate influent cod and tn concentration and c n were described in eqs 3 5 3 t n r e s c w 7 17 nitrat e l r 21 02 ta n l r 79 33 r 2 0 48 t n r e c w 0 092 t n i n 1 23 co d i n 23 67 r 2 0 83 4 nitrat e r e s c w 9 23

represent nitrate removal efficiency of scw and cw tanre scw and tanre cw represent tan removal efficiency of scw and cw nitratelr and tanlr represent the nitrate loading rate and tan loading rate g n m 2 d 1 tnin and codin represent the influent tn and cod concentration mg l 1 c n represent cod tn the results show that the models can well fit the nitrogen removal efficiencies in cw with r 2 of 0 83 tn 0 91 nitrate and 0 65 tan which can well guide cw operations these results also further illustrate that the influent cod and tn strongly affect the cw performance for the scw the removal efficiency of tn and nitrate are mainly affected by the loading rate however the fitting models of tn nitrate and tan did not show a significant fit effect which were observed with r 2 of 0 48 tn 0 62 nitrate and 0 34 tan respectively these results demonstrated that the denitrification efficiency of scw was less disturbed by operating factors and can maintain at a relatively stable level 3 6 balance analysis in different cws 3 6 1 nitrogen balance analysis nitrogen mass balance of scw and cw further revealed the benefits of sulfur on nitrogen removal which can provide theoretical guidance for constructed wetland process optimization fig 6 showed that the residue of tan nitrate and removed as nitrogen gas were the majority of the nitrogen mass distribution about 27 22 of nitrogen 15 33 of tan 10 92 of nitrate and 0 97 of nitrite was directly discharged to environmental during the whole experimental this was mainly due to its high nitrate removal efficiency because nitrate was the preferred electron acceptor over n2o for denitrification and more nitrate existed in the system which was often the inducement of high n2o release while about 52 38 of nitrogen 10 54 of tan 41 20 of nitrate and 0 64 of nitrite was discharged with effluent in the cw in addition there was no significant difference in nitrogen accumulation by plant assimilation between scw 3 43 and cw 3 86 suggesting that plant growth was not affected by sulfur this might be attributed to the top down water distribution resulting in no direct contact between sulfur and roots like the plant assimilation the n2o emissions also demonstrated no significant difference between cw 0 65 and scw 0 64 the total nitrogen of substrate adsorption in cw 4 28 was about 1 63 times in scw 2 63 during the experiment given all of that the contribution of substrate adsorption and plant uptake for n removal was less than 8 previous studies reported that n removal via plant assimilation and substrate adsorption in cw accounts for less than 25 of the total load zhuang et al 2019 the nitrogen removal by gas and other ways in scw 66 10 was significantly higher than in cw more gaseous forms of nitrogen due to sad 3 6 2 electron donor balance analysis in scw electron donor balance analysis was used to evaluate the sulfur and nitrogen transformation pathway in scw generally sulfur transformation pathways in the scw can be divided into three pathways autotrophic denitrification dissolved oxygen oxidation and sulfur disproportionation process driscoll and bisogni 1978 ju et al 2008 oh et al 2011 autotrophic denitrification with s0 as electron donor was considered as the main sulfate production pathway in sulfur based autotrophic constructed wetlands li et al 2020a to further clarify the role of sulfur in nitrogen removal in elemental sulfur based autotrophic constructed wetlands the transformation pathway of inorganic electrons in scw was quantitatively analyzed the contribution rates to so4 2 by autotrophic denitrification consumption dissolved oxygen oxidation consumption and sulfur disproportionation process are calculated based on the nitrate concentration and sulfate where they were presented in fig 7 at stage i heterotrophic denitrification was dominated in scw due to high c n of influent about 47 23 48 14 and 36 29 of sulfate production contributed to the autotrophic denitrification process and more than 50 of sulfate production was due to the disproportionation and oxidation process at stage ii and stage iii when the c n was reduced to 1 and 0 5 it was evident that sad was the main contributor to its electron donor output the sulfate production by autotrophic denitrification was increased gradually with the hrt increasing at stage ii where the contribution rates were 66 88 70 36 and 72 51 respectively in addition it was found that about 28 00 of sulfate with hrt of 1 d was generated due to the disproportionation process and the intensity of the sulfur disproportionation process decreased slightly with the increase of hrt the same tendency was observed when the scw operated under the lower c n of 0 5 at stage iii the proportion of sulfate produced by dissolved oxygen oxidation was 9 55 8 15 and 7 46 when hrt of 1d 2d and 3d with an average 2 41 lower than that at stage ii on the contrary the contribution rate by the sulfur disproportionation process accounted for 11 16 20 92 in theory sulfate increment is only related to the nitrate denitrification with the theory ratio of reduction to generation being 1 7 54 moreover the sulfur disproportionation process was not obvious when only nitrate occurred in the wastewater wan et al 2019 it is calculated that the ratio of nitrate removal to sulfate formation at stage ii and stage iii are 1 10 25 and 1 9 58 the average per mg l 1 nitrate removal to sulfate formation of 9 92 mg l 1 at stage ii and stage iii respectively which are all higher than the theoretical value sulfate production was higher than the theoretical value indicating that sulfur oxidation and disproportionation occurred in scw coupled with autotrophic denitrification and it is worth mentioning that denitrification contributes more than 75 of the sulfate production in the scw under carbon limited conditions 3 6 3 microbial community analysis the alpha diversity of the microbial community is shown in table 2 chao 1 index of scw was increased indicating that the richness of the microbial community was improved with sulfur addition there was no significant difference between shannon and simpson indexes showing the similar microbial diversity between scw and cw microbial community compositions of scw and cw are illustrated in fig 8 at the phylum level microbial communities of scw and cw were nearly similar fig 8a top four dominant phylum were all proteobacteria chloroflexi bacteroidetes and acidobacteria accounting for over 80 of the total microbial relative abundance in all samples these phyla of microbes have been reported as typical ones performing both heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrification processes li et al 2020b yang et al 2021 especially proteobacteria have been reported to be the most dominant phylum that participated in the nitrogen and phosphorus removal process hoefel et al 2005 the higher relative abundance of proteobacteria in scw 29 42 indicated that nitrogen removal was promoted by sad in addition some sulfur oxidizing bacteria such as chloroflexus aggregans and oscillochloris trichoides were attributed to chloroflexi which can promote sad process grouzdev et al 2019 kanno et al 2019 at the class level fig 8b there was a significant difference in gammaproteobacteria between scw 22 90 and cw 10 17 due to sad p 0 05 which might be the most important contributors to the denitrification process chen et al 2018 at the genus level fig 8c thiobacillus sulfuritalea and geobacter all belonged to proteobacteria phylum where they were played an important role in sulfur oxidation it was found that thiobacillus the typical sulfur oxidizing bacteria wang et al 2019 was more enriched in the scw 2 64 which was significantly higher than that in cw 0 04 moreover the relative abundance of sulfuritalea in scw was 1 24 0 08 of cw which can oxidize thiosulfate sulfur and hydrogen using nitrate as electron acceptor kojima and fukui 2011 this confirmed the higher sad process in scw geobacter was also considered as the typical denitrifying genera for s0 reduction in wastewater treatment processes liang et al 2019 which might cooperate with other bacteria to complete nitrogen removal contrarily in scw 0 01 higher pseudonocardia relative abundance of in cw 1 53 suggested that heterotrophic ammoxidation might be occurred liu et al 2005 this may also can explain the possibility of better nitrification in cw the co occurrence networks of microbial communities in cws were constructed to explore the co occurrence patterns of network complexity where they were presented in fig 8d it was shown that the complexity of microbial correlation was followed as scw cw where the number of edges in scw 1247 was higher than that of cw 1236 the links of positive correlation were more significant than that of negative correlation indicating that the cooperative relationship between microorganisms was more significant than the competition the interaction relationship among microorganisms was altered by sulfur addition where the positive correlation in cw 60 76 was higher than in scw 56 94 the average clustering coefficient of scw was higher than that of cw indicating that the connection between nodes was closer in scw a more stable network was formed due to microorganism aggregation liu et al 2022 and the modularity of scw was higher than that of cw suggesting that a higher community structure order was mediated due to sulfur substrate intervention more connections tended to be concentrated in a few modules in scw 3 6 4 potential nitrogen metabolism mechanisms the potential nitrogen cycle s functional metabolic pathway in different cws was presented in fig 9 it had significant differences between scw and cw in the enzyme activity of n transformation p 0 05 specifically the denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction process was improved with the addition of sulfur which confirmed that denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction were the main nitrate reduction pathways in scw the relative abundance of nitrate reductase ec 1 7 5 1 nitrite reductase ec 1 7 2 1 and nitric oxide reductase ec 1 7 2 5 involved in the denitrification process were increased with 0 0795 0 0149 and 0 0198 in scw respectively nitrate was converted to nitrite by nitrate reductase which was generally driven by nitrate reduction related functional genes e g narg narh nari etc it was shown that the relative abundances of these functional genes in scw were all significantly higher than that in cw p 0 05 fig 9b and then nitrite was converted to no and n2o by nitrite reductase where the relative abundance of nirk in scw was also higher than that in cw it can be observed that the relative abundance of hydroxylamine reductase ec 1 7 99 1 was increased with the addition of sulfur in scw which might be an important reason for the high nh4 n concentration of effluent in scw the genes involved in the dissimilatory nitrate reduction nird and nitrogen fixation nifdhk processes in scw were higher than that in cw 4 conclusion element sulfur based autotrophic denitrification constructed wetland were operated to investigate nitrogen removal performance balance and removal pathway in this study results show that scw performed superior tn and nitrate removal performance than cw which might be due to effective autotrophic denitrification based on s0 the stronger resistance to influent with low c n was found in scw as c n decreased tan removal performance was not ideal in the separate scw operation mode with the average tan removal efficiency lower than 20 while the cw scw combined system can significantly improve the tan removal perforamnce sad is the primary mechanism of nitrogen removal in scw thiobacillus and sulfuritalea were considered to be the responsible affect the performance the elemental sulfur based denitrification process 9 92 mg of so4 2 would be produced as nitrate per mg removed which of them were attributed to the synergistic effect of autotrophic denitrification oxidation and sulfur disproportionation process therefore sulfur autotrophic integrated constructed

15367,constructed wetlands cws integrated with sulfur autotrophic denitrification to stimulate high rate nitrogen removal from carbon limited wastewater holds particular application prospect due to no excessive carbon source addition high efficiency and good stability in this study we conducted elemental sulfur based constructed wetland scw and traditional constructed wetland cw under different c n 2 1 and 0 5 to explore the feasibility and mechanisms for nitrogen removal from low c n wastewater compared with cw scw was demonstrated more robust in nitrogen removal in the case of low c n influent when the influent c n control was at 0 5 scw observed total nitrogen tn and nitrate removal efficiency of 69 36 3 96 and 81 71 3 96 with the corresponding removal rate of 1 18 0 66 and 1 70 0 92 g n m 2 d 1 which were 2 11 and 10 03 times of cw respectively the nitrate removal rate constant k in the scw was 1 05 3 83 and 10 33 times higher than the cw with c n of 2 1 and 0 5 furthermore 14 40 54 51 and 79 82 of nitrogen were removed by the sulfur autotrophic denitrification sad in scw which also contributed 43 89 73 68 and 71 70 of sulfate production moreover the combined system of cw scw is proved be an efficient operation mode for simultaneously removing total ammonia nitrogen tan and nitrate in the scw the richness of the microbial community was improved and sulfur oxidizing genera e g thiobacillus sulfurimonas was selectively enriched which affect the performance the elemental sulfur based denitrification process the nitrate reduction pathway was overwhelmed by denitrification and the dissimilatory nitrate reduction process these findings offer elemental sulfur based autotrophic denitrification constructed wetland has excellent potential to enhance nitrogen removal from carbon limited wastewater graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sulfur autotrophic denitrification constructed wetlands nitrogen removal low c n nitrogen and sulfur cycle data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrogen discharge without deep treatment from carbon limited wastewater such as agriculture drainage slightly polluted river water aquaculture wastewaters and secondary effluents from the wastewater treatment plant is the primary cause of water ecosystem security li et al 2021 wu et al 2013 many freshwater lakes in china such as taihu lake chaohu lake and poyang lake are facing severe problems such as eutrophication and the decline in surface water quality guo et al 2019 generally nitrate removal is the main stumble block for these carbon limited wastewaters purification advanced technologies such as electrodialysis ion exchange catalytic oxidation reverse osmosis etc for nitrate advanced polishing from the carbon limited wastewaters quite efficiently however they are often cost prohibitive liu et al 2020b moreover traditional biological nitrification denitrification always inefficient when treated wastewater lacking electron donors bezbaruah and zhang 2003 therefore it is necessary to develop optimal technologies to realize high nitrogen removal performance from carbon limited wastewaters constructed wetlands cws is a promising eco technology due to its low construction cost simple maintenance and environmentally friendliness which has been widely used for nitrogen removal from various wastewaters flores et al 2019 wu et al 2015 in general heterotrophic denitrification is the primary removal pathway for nitrate in traditional cws and the availability of a carbon source for biological denitrification is the main limiting factor it was shown that the carbon source provided only from the root exudates was not enough for nitrogen removal gagnon et al 2007 heterotrophic denitrification requires sufficient carbon sources as electron donors however the accurate addition of the carbon source is difficult wang et al 2009 and excessive organic carbon addition such as methanol sodium acetate and glucose will lead to secondary pollution and high costs lu et al 2009 xu et al 2018 meanwhile the hydraulic conductivity will weaken the sludge produced by heterotrophic nitrification and denitrification furthermore the continuous accumulation of pollutants and secretion of extracellular polymers from microorganisms will also cause wetland clogging du et al 2016 zhang et al 2012 because of inefficient nitrogen removal in cws for the carbon limited wastewater disposal it is imperative to address the problems associated with nitrogen removal in cws under low carbon to nitrogen c n mass ratio influent conditions element sulfur s0 is readily available as a less toxic and low cost form of sulfur that is used as an electron donor acceptor in two main types of bioprocesses i e s0 autotrophic denitrification s0ad and s0 reducing organics removal s0or guo et al 2022 researchers also have found that sulfur autotrophic denitrification sad is an alternative technology to improve nitrogen removal efficiency wang et al 2021 it can avoid the increase of biological sludge production nitrous oxide n2o accumulation and emission owing to excessive carbon source addition and potential generation of toxic compounds due to the chlorination process yang et al 2016 zhou et al 2011 sad has been widely used in low c n wastewater treatment c n 3 such as groundwater drinking water urban sewage aquaculture effluent and industrial wastewater hu et al 2020 huang et al 2019 some studies had been reported that it could achieve high nitrate removal performance form the micro polluted wastewater such as agriculture drainage aquaculture wastewaters and secondary effluents as s0 was added into cws for example the average nitrate removal efficiency was 96 10 in a vertical flow constructed wetland using s0 limestone zeolite and volcanic rock with a volume ratio of 1 1 1 1 as substrates about 1 2 of c n wang et al 2020 however it was mainly concentrated on nitrogen enhancement performance sulfur source selection and operation parameter optimization in s0 based constructed wetland scw at present bezbaruah and zhang 2003 li et al 2021 wang et al 2020 the quantitative parameters for nitrogen transformation dynamics and mechanism and byproduct composition while s0 added are still limited it is unknown whether it will cause excessive sulfur source consumption and byproducts production in this study three parallel scw and traditionally cw were constructed and operated under three different c n 2 1 and 0 5 and hrts 1 d 2 d and 3 d the cw scw combined operation mode was conducted to simultaneous enhance the nitrate and total ammonia nitrogen tan removal the objectives of this study were 1 to evaluate the nitrogen removal performance of scw under low c n operation conditions 2 to investigate the nitrogen transformation dynamics mechanism and fate of nitrogen in scw 3 to quantify the contribution of nitrogen removal pathway and byproducts formation based on s0 4 to analyze microbial community and nitrogen metabolism mechanisms in scw in addition this study will provide technical support for cw using s0 as substrates for nitrogen removal from carbon limited wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 construction and operation of experimental cw microcosms the laboratory established three groups of identical cylindrical cw and scw reactors polyvinyl chloride inner diameter of 15 cm and height of 45 cm and operated at 22 33 c aluminum foil was used to cover the side surfaces of the reactors the main microcosm filter layer comprised three layers for scw and cw the bottom supporting layer of scw and cw was filled with 5 cm of zeolite size 2 3 cm the function layer for scw comprised 8 cm of element sulfur size 0 5 0 8 cm and 27 cm of zeolite size 0 5 0 8 cm as the layer while the function layer for cw was filled only with zeolite size 0 5 0 8 cm the upper layer of scw and cw was 5 cm of the sand 0 1 0 3 cm to support plant growth fig s1 a perforated pvc pipe height 66 cm diameter 3 2 cm was installed in the center of the systems for measuring dissolved oxygen do concentration and ph inside the wetland system the iris pseudoacorus was screened as model planted with a density of 2 plants per reactor as it strong vitality wide adaptability to the environment and cold tolerance all reactors were inoculated with activated sludge collected from the gaobeidian municipal wastewater treatment plant beijing china during the inoculation period and when these constructed wetlands start up successfully 20 d cw and scw groups were operated continuously with the hrt of 1 d all constructed wetland systems were operated in a sequencing batch mode as shown in table s1 the formal experiment of scw and cw was conducted for 180 days in three stages stage i stage iii to test the effect of c n i e 2 1 and 0 5 on nitrogen removal cw scw and cw cw were operated under c n of 0 5 and hrt of 3 d cw for 1 d and scw for 2 d from day 181 to day 220 namely stage iv during stage iv the operation systems were switched to the combined system to explore the feasibility of coupling scw as a module with the traditional cws to strengthen low c n wastewater treatment the control group was cw cw combined system which is in a series of a downstream cw and an upstream cw the cw scw combined system was conducted in series cw and scw where effluent of cw was influent by scw cod concentration was changed with the varies c n at different stages 2 2 wastewater sampling and analysis all samples were filtered through 0 45 μm filters cod tan nitrate nitrite total phosphorus tp and sulfide concentration were analyzed using a uv vis spectrophotometer dr 6000 hach usa tn was expressed by the sum of tan nitrate and nitrite an ion chromatograph basic ic plus 83 switzerland was used to determine the concentration of sulfate so4 2 the do and ph were measured in situ using a portable multi parameter analyzer wtw germany all water samples were measured in triplicate the comprehensive toxicity of the influent and effluent of scw and cw was measured under the four stages by vibrio qinghaiensis sp q67 beijing hammatsu photon techniques inc beijing china the standard methods for culture medium preparation and q67 incubation were followed as a previous article reported zhang et al 2015 luminescence inhibition assay was performed in test tubes using an rs9901 luminometer shanghai rong sheng biological electronics co ltd shanghai china water samples or control liquid 2 ml 0 5 dimethyl sulphoxide dmso solution were added into each tube and the bacterial suspension 50 μl was added at a 10 s interval after 15 min exposure of the bacteria to the sample at 22 1 c the relative light unit of the luminescent bacterium q67 was measured the potential luminescence inhibition i of the water samples is calculated as eq 1 1 i r 0 r r 0 100 where r is the relative light unit of q67 to the water samples r0 represents the relative light unit of q67 exposed to the blank control samples the removal loading n rl g n m 2 d 1 of nitrogen compounds is calculated as eq 2 2 n rl g n m 2 d 1 c v s t 1000 where v is the volume of influent l s is the surface area of each cw m2 t is the hrt d c is the concentration of n compounds mg l 1 2 3 plant sampling and analysis iris pseudoacorus in scw and cw were collected at the beginning and end of the experiment all plant samples were washed using mill q water and dried with qualitative filter paper the fresh weight fw was weighed and the length of roots stems and leaves were measured all samples were dried in the oven and balanced for the dry weight dw dried plant samples were ground into powders and passed through a 100 mesh sieve to determine n contents using thermo scientific flash smart elemental analyzer usa nitrogen uptake can be calculated by measuring its weight both fresh and dry weight and nitrogen content at the beginning and the end of the experiments 2 4 substrates sampling and microbiological analysis substrates per unit volume were put into the centrifuge tube 50 ml for ultrasonic vibration the biofilms were obtained by centrifugation freezing and drying biofilm samples were ground by agate mortar and then n content was measured using elemental analysis nitrogen adsorption by biofilms can be calculated by measuring its weight and nitrogen content at the experiment fang et al 2022 at the end of the experiments substrate samples were collected and then biofilms were detached via shaking and centrifugation the microbial samples were stored in a freezer compartment at 70 c before dna extraction the total dna of each microbial sample was extracted using the e z n a soil dna kit omega bio tek norcross ga u s the bacterial 16s rrna gene region v3 v4 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the primers 338f 806r liu et al 2020a high throughput sequencing analysis was conducted using illumina miseq from majorbio shanghai china 2 5 statistical analysis microbial and water quality data presented in the present study was the mean of three replicates spss 26 0 ibm usa was used to statistically analyze whether microbial community functional genes and nitrogen content in different cw were statistically significant using the one way analysis of variance anova followed by duncan s multiple range test at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrogen removal performance fig 1 and fig s2 showed the performance of tn tan nitrate and nitrite removed in cw and scw during the four stages compared with cw superior tn and nitrate removal efficiencies were observed in scw during all the operation stages the effluent nitrogen concentration of scw was below 10 mg l 1 under all operating conditions however the scw appeared to have a lower tan removal efficiency during stage i to stage iii 3 1 1 tn removal for the tn removal performance fig 1a and fig 1d significant within group differences p 0 05 were all observed between scw and cw with the average removal rate of 1 53 g n m 2 d 1 and 1 02 g n m 2 d 1 with the corresponding removal efficiencies were 73 83 and 47 82 respectively however it was noticeable that there was no significant difference between scw 70 87 8 49 and cw 71 16 9 87 at stage i p 0 05 which might be attributed to stronger heterotrophic denitrification with sufficient carbon source c n 2 which consistent with the previous study fu et al 2022 moreover it was also shown that carbon sources will be preferentially used as the electron donor to perform heterotrophic denitrification while it can meet the electron donor requirement guerrero et al 2011 when the constructed wetlands switched to stage ii the influent c n was decreased from 2 to 1 and the average tn removal efficiency of scw was slightly reduced by 68 89 5 93 however the average removal efficiency of cw sharply decreased from 71 16 9 87 to 46 34 3 68 during stage ii due to obstruction of the heterotrophic denitrification process in the low c n conditions the stronger resistance to influent with lower c n 0 5 was found in scw as c n decreased the average removal efficiency of scw can still keep at 69 36 3 97 with a corresponding average tn removal rate of 1 698 g n m 2 d 1 at stage iii which might be due to effective autotrophic denitrification based on s0 where nitrate was be preferentially used as the reduced electron mediators park et al 2015 most noteworthy is that tn removal efficiencies in scw 85 26 3 07 demonstrated an upward trend in stage iv compared to stage iii as the cw scw combined system enhanced the removal performance of tan fig 1b 3 1 2 tan removal tan removal efficiencies of cw were 75 31 11 77 66 47 7 88 and 68 25 6 13 in stage i to stage iii fig 1b with corresponding removal rates fig 1e of 0 68 0 27 g n m 2 d 1 0 61 0 23 g n m 2 d 1 and 0 65 0 26 g n m 2 d 1 however tan accumulation was observed in all scw groups and the average tan removal efficiencies of scw in stage i to stage iii were observed at 18 23 16 21 and 14 51 lower than in the cw groups respectively the important reason was that s0 oxidation competed with nitrification for do li et al 2020a mccarty et al 1990 also found that reductive sulfur compound is a kind of nitrification inhibitor that can inhibit tan performance in cw mccarty et al 1990 notably the tan accumulation was dramatically alleviated when the two stage constructed wetland series operated during stage iv the average tan removal efficiency in cw scw increased from 53 73 6 13 to 80 83 5 87 with the corresponding tan removal rate of 0 49 0 19 g n m 2 d 1 the cw cw combined system also observed tan removal efficiency of 82 34 4 16 in this stage it is mainly attributed to the increased surface area of constructed wetland systems and an oxygen enriched environment created in the two stage constructed wetland series operation conditions 3 1 3 nitrate removal and nitrite accumulation for the nitrate removal there was no significant difference between scw and cw at stage i p 0 05 due to relatively abundant carbon sources in the influent while a significant difference was observed in terms of nitrate removal fig 1c p 0 05 in stage ii to stage iv scw presented much better nitrate removal efficiency 84 56 5 66 than that of cw 19 97 11 81 that was consistent with the results of other studies with sulfur based autotrophic denitrification technologies zheng et al 2021 during stage ii the average nitrate removal efficiency in scw was 83 04 6 37 with the corresponding nitrate removal rate of 1 24 0 57 g n m 2 d 1 in comparison the cw observed a removal efficiency of 35 08 6 37 and removal rate of 0 58 0 37 g n m 2 d 1 notably when controlling the influent c n at 0 5 the average removal efficiency of scw was maintained at 81 72 5 66 in stage iii and cw scw was observed at 88 59 3 22 in stage iv it was observed at 12 03 5 66 and 13 38 4 44 in the cw and cw cw system respectively these results indicated that at lower c n the majority of nitrogen in scw was removed by autotrophic denitrification fig s2 illustrated that nitrite accumulation was also found in this study even when nitrate concentration was low in scw and cw effluent had a lower nitrite accumulation during the study moreover in scw and cw the nitrite concentration increased as c n decreased the highest nitrite concentration in scw was observed at stage iii at 0 33 0 10 mg l 1 and cw effluent observed an average concentration of 0 23 0 10 mg l 1 during stage iv nitrite accumulation in the two stage constructed wetland s effluent was alleviated compared with day 160 day 180 fig s2d mainly due to more nitrate production conversed from nitrite under a higher do condition of the two stage series operation condition in summary scw can use s0 as an efficient electron donor to perform better n removal and should operate under relatively long hrt to avoid nitrite accumulation 3 2 cod and tp removal performance fig 2 and fig s3 showed cod and tp removal performance in cw and scw during the whole experiment the results demonstrated no significant difference between scw and cw during the four operation stages p 0 05 generally the effluent cod concentration of the scw and cw effluent cod concentration was kept lower than 10 mg l 1 and effluent tp concentration was detected to be lower than 0 30 mg l 1 for the cod scw and cw show gradually increased removal efficiencies from stage i to stage iv scw was observed at 61 90 6 02 67 10 10 21 89 74 9 43 and 88 24 6 68 and cw followed at 57 81 5 96 68 70 8 80 88 81 9 28 and 88 94 8 71 respectively fig 2a which may be due to the low influent cod in stage iii and stage iv fig 2b demonstrates that the cod degradation trend of the cw and scw under the different stages can well fit the first order kinetic model at the initial 36 h sequence batch experiment table s3 illustrated that there was no significant difference between scw and cw of the cod degradation constant p 0 05 due to the relatively small influent cod value in the influent under all operating conditions however the c n also can influence the cod degradation kinetics as the higher c n operation conditions observed a smaller degradation constant for example the scw had k values of 0 021 0 030 and 0 031 h 1 and the cw had k values of 0 028 0 021 and 0 034 h 1 when controlling the influent c n of 2 1 and 0 5 respectively the opposite result was found in the research of the previous study which can be attributed to higher do dang et al 2022 fig 2c illustrated that tp removal performance was kept at a stable level under the different operation conditions for example the scw removal efficiencies of the four different stages slightly fluctuated between 65 95 2 98 and 68 35 4 02 and the cw s removal efficiencies also ranged between 63 89 4 37 and 66 71 4 06 these results demonstrated that the tp removal in cws was dominant by the substrate adsorption and plant uptake coban et al 2015 and the introduction of s0 to the constructed wetland has less impact on the phosphorus removal furthermore the batch degradation experiments fig 2d illustrated that over 50 of phosphorus could be removed within 30 h and subsequent 42 h were kept at stable values which further explains the reason for the phosphorus removal efficiency of the scw and cw can remain a stable state under different c n and hrt operation conditions 3 3 effluent sulfates sulfides and toxicity fig 3 a and b shows the performance of sulfates and sulfides formation in the scw and cw during the whole experiment generally the influent sulfates ranged between 20 76 and 42 71 mg l 1 during the entire investigation the effluent sulfate in cw was kept at a stable level between 35 55 and 66 50 mg l 1 and the average effluent sulfate concentrations in cw showed an increasing trend with the increased hrt 16 19 2 87 16 93 2 67 and 19 09 4 74 mg l 1 with hrt of 1 2 and 3 days the increased sulfate in cw may derive from the leaching of the constructed wetlands substrate such as zeolite gravel etc the effluent sulfates concentration of scw at stage i to stage iv were 67 83 5 11 103 57 11 49 145 33 9 42 and 150 77 5 84 mg l 1 respectively compared with cw the effluent sulfate in scw was not significantly increased compared to cw during stage i as the sulfur autotrophic denitrification process involved in this stage was inhibited however this value increased significantly 55 97 9 21 88 61 3 55 and 100 38 1 62 mg l 1 from stage ii to stage iv as elemental sulfur based autotrophic denitrification dominated to remove of nitrogen in the scw even so the sulfate concentration of scw effluent meets the class v standard of surface water during the whole stage same as the sulfate s formation the sulfides effluent concentration in scw was observed at the lowest average value of 0 37 0 15 mg l 1 during stage i and 0 56 0 21 0 55 0 17 and 0 75 0 20 mg l 1 was detected during stage ii to stage iv these results indicated that the primary sulfide sources in cw are sulfate reduction reaction and sulfur disproportionation reaction wu et al 2011 moreover the effluent sulfide was relatively higher in the long hrt operation conditions as the easily anaerobic environment in the scw for sulfate reduction fig 3b demonstrated the kinetics of sulfate formation under different c n and the results showed that the sulfate leaching in cw completed a relative equilibrium value within 18 h however the relatively equilibrium value of sulfate formation in scw was observed after 36 h proving that the sad process occurred within 36 h the amount of sulfate formation in scw and cw were well fitted with the first order kinetics of products formation δ s u l f a t e c 1 e k t δ s u l f a t e c k and t represent the amount of sulfate formation equilibrium coefficient kinetic constant and reaction time respectively the equilibrium coefficients c of scw were 46 93 2 08 86 02 3 11 and 93 04 4 16 mg l 1 under c n of 2 1 and 0 5 with the corresponding r 2 of 0 962 0 973 and 0 930 respectively table s2 the equilibrium coefficients remained stable 16 34 0 87 17 97 0 67 and 16 54 1 00 under three different c n conditions in cw the above results also showed a significant correlation between sulfate formation and nitrate removal p 0 05 indicating that sad was the primary process for n removal under low c n in scw cecchetti et al 2022 in order to explore the changes of water toxicity in the scw and cw the toxicity test of luminescent bacteria was carried out it could be seen from fig 3c that the inhibition rates of the luminescence kept at a stable level which was slightly ranged from 19 6 2 6 to 21 5 3 9 during the four operation stages generally after the scw and cw treated almost all of the samples detected a downward trend on the inhibition rates of the luminescence which range from 10 8 4 4 to 19 9 1 8 indicating the excellent guarantee of water security there was no significant difference of the inhibition rates between the scw and cw groups as well as the different operation stages moreover a previous study also found that elemental sulfur has lower effect on plant leaves while the pyrite has larger impact on the plant and toxicity li et al 2020a these results can prove that the amount of sulfate or sulfide produced in the scw at this study concentration conditions has little effect on effluent toxicity 3 4 enhanced nitrogen removal in scw fig 4 showed the periodic nitrogen transformation in cw and scw under the different operation conditions the results showed that tn nitrate and tan removal tendencies of cw and scw were fitted to the first order kinetic equations fig 4 and table 1 in the cw tn removal performances were greatly influenced by the influent c n while this influence was weakened in the scw for instance the first order kinetics constants k of scw were 0 018 0 016 and 0 018 h 1 during stage i to stage iii respectively in contrast the k value of cw was significantly reduced from 0 017 to 0 005 as the c n decreased from 2 to 0 5 furthermore the k values of tn in scw were 1 05 2 28 and 3 60 times of cw when the c n were controlled at 2 1 and 0 5 respectively demonstrating the advantages and feasibility of elemental sulfur based constructed wetlands for low c n micro polluted wastewater remediation there was a significant difference between scw and cw on nitrate removal p 0 05 notably the nitrate showed an increasing trend during the first 18 h fig 4c in the cw may be due to the superior nitrification capacity lead the nitrate generation rate being significantly higher than its reduction rate resulting in the accumulation of nitrate the k values of nitrate removal in scw during stage i to stage iii were kept at a stable level 0 037 0 029 and 0 034 h 1 which were about 2 05 4 83 and 11 33 times the cw groups respectively moreover hrt prolonging is negative to nitrate removal under the condition of insufficient carbon sources this also shows that the root exudates alone were insufficient to maintain the heterotrophic nitrogen removal process in traditional cw gagnon et al 2007 these results further explained that s0 based autotrophic denitrification could be employed as an efficient technology for the extremely low c n water remediation as mentioned above for the tan removal fig 4b the primary tan removal process occurred during the first 30 h in both cw and scw however tan removal efficiencies and rates in the scw were lower than those in cw with the decrease of c n the tan removal rates decreased which was consistent with the results observed in the long term experiment moreover the oxygen consumption rates of scw groups were considerably faster than that of cw groups which demonstrated that the poor ammonia nitrogen removal of scw may be due to part of the dissolved oxygen being consumed by the s0 oxidation process li et al 2020a generally as for nitrite accumulation and removal performance there was no apparent correlation between its variation and influent c n the nitrite in scw after three days batch test was significantly higher than that in cw which was consistent with the long term experiment results as an intermediate product nitrite removal increased first and then decreased or maintained balance 0 2 mg l 1 3 5 effect of hrt and c n on nitrogen removal the effects of tn loading rate on nitrogen removal rate were investigated by varying the hrt between 1 day and 3 days fig 5 presented the relationship between nitrogen removal rate and tn loading rate under different c n conditions generally the nitrogen removal rate showed a significant positive correlation with the tn loading rate under almost all the c n operation conditions except tan in cw when the c n was controlled at 0 5 r 2 0 665 0 700 for the scw the slopes of linear equations between tn removal rate and loading rate were 0 531 0 564 and 0 639 when the influent c n were 2 1 and 0 5 respectively which were much higher than the cw 0 515 0 448 and 0 267 respectively the same trend was found in the relationship between nitrate removal rate and tn loading rate these results also demonstrated that scw exhibits a stronger resistance to the high tn loading rate however tan showed an opposite trend in nitrate removal the slopes of the equations between tan removal rate and tn loading rate of cw were more significant than those of scw which was also consistent with the results mentioned above correlation analysis and multiple linear regression were performed to illustrate the relationship between nitrogen tn nitrate and tan removal efficiencies and operating factors such as nitrogen loading rate influent cod and tn concentration and c n table s3 showed that the nitrogen tn nitrate and tan loading rates strongly correlate with the nitrogen removal efficiencies in scw however a significant correlation was observed for the cw between tan removal efficiency and nitrogen load rates it is worth noting that influent cod and c n were significantly correlated with tn and nitrate removal efficiency in cw and the nitrogen removal rate in scw is not affected by influent cod and c n the multi factor linear regression functions between nitrogen removal efficiencies and these significantly correlated operating factors such as nitrogen loading rate influent cod and tn concentration and c n were described in eqs 3 5 3 t n r e s c w 7 17 nitrat e l r 21 02 ta n l r 79 33 r 2 0 48 t n r e c w 0 092 t n i n 1 23 co d i n 23 67 r 2 0 83 4 nitrat e r e s c w 9 23

represent nitrate removal efficiency of scw and cw tanre scw and tanre cw represent tan removal efficiency of scw and cw nitratelr and tanlr represent the nitrate loading rate and tan loading rate g n m 2 d 1 tnin and codin represent the influent tn and cod concentration mg l 1 c n represent cod tn the results show that the models can well fit the nitrogen removal efficiencies in cw with r 2 of 0 83 tn 0 91 nitrate and 0 65 tan which can well guide cw operations these results also further illustrate that the influent cod and tn strongly affect the cw performance for the scw the removal efficiency of tn and nitrate are mainly affected by the loading rate however the fitting models of tn nitrate and tan did not show a significant fit effect which were observed with r 2 of 0 48 tn 0 62 nitrate and 0 34 tan respectively these results demonstrated that the denitrification efficiency of scw was less disturbed by operating factors and can maintain at a relatively stable level 3 6 balance analysis in different cws 3 6 1 nitrogen balance analysis nitrogen mass balance of scw and cw further revealed the benefits of sulfur on nitrogen removal which can provide theoretical guidance for constructed wetland process optimization fig 6 showed that the residue of tan nitrate and removed as nitrogen gas were the majority of the nitrogen mass distribution about 27 22 of nitrogen 15 33 of tan 10 92 of nitrate and 0 97 of nitrite was directly discharged to environmental during the whole experimental this was mainly due to its high nitrate removal efficiency because nitrate was the preferred electron acceptor over n2o for denitrification and more nitrate existed in the system which was often the inducement of high n2o release while about 52 38 of nitrogen 10 54 of tan 41 20 of nitrate and 0 64 of nitrite was discharged with effluent in the cw in addition there was no significant difference in nitrogen accumulation by plant assimilation between scw 3 43 and cw 3 86 suggesting that plant growth was not affected by sulfur this might be attributed to the top down water distribution resulting in no direct contact between sulfur and roots like the plant assimilation the n2o emissions also demonstrated no significant difference between cw 0 65 and scw 0 64 the total nitrogen of substrate adsorption in cw 4 28 was about 1 63 times in scw 2 63 during the experiment given all of that the contribution of substrate adsorption and plant uptake for n removal was less than 8 previous studies reported that n removal via plant assimilation and substrate adsorption in cw accounts for less than 25 of the total load zhuang et al 2019 the nitrogen removal by gas and other ways in scw 66 10 was significantly higher than in cw more gaseous forms of nitrogen due to sad 3 6 2 electron donor balance analysis in scw electron donor balance analysis was used to evaluate the sulfur and nitrogen transformation pathway in scw generally sulfur transformation pathways in the scw can be divided into three pathways autotrophic denitrification dissolved oxygen oxidation and sulfur disproportionation process driscoll and bisogni 1978 ju et al 2008 oh et al 2011 autotrophic denitrification with s0 as electron donor was considered as the main sulfate production pathway in sulfur based autotrophic constructed wetlands li et al 2020a to further clarify the role of sulfur in nitrogen removal in elemental sulfur based autotrophic constructed wetlands the transformation pathway of inorganic electrons in scw was quantitatively analyzed the contribution rates to so4 2 by autotrophic denitrification consumption dissolved oxygen oxidation consumption and sulfur disproportionation process are calculated based on the nitrate concentration and sulfate where they were presented in fig 7 at stage i heterotrophic denitrification was dominated in scw due to high c n of influent about 47 23 48 14 and 36 29 of sulfate production contributed to the autotrophic denitrification process and more than 50 of sulfate production was due to the disproportionation and oxidation process at stage ii and stage iii when the c n was reduced to 1 and 0 5 it was evident that sad was the main contributor to its electron donor output the sulfate production by autotrophic denitrification was increased gradually with the hrt increasing at stage ii where the contribution rates were 66 88 70 36 and 72 51 respectively in addition it was found that about 28 00 of sulfate with hrt of 1 d was generated due to the disproportionation process and the intensity of the sulfur disproportionation process decreased slightly with the increase of hrt the same tendency was observed when the scw operated under the lower c n of 0 5 at stage iii the proportion of sulfate produced by dissolved oxygen oxidation was 9 55 8 15 and 7 46 when hrt of 1d 2d and 3d with an average 2 41 lower than that at stage ii on the contrary the contribution rate by the sulfur disproportionation process accounted for 11 16 20 92 in theory sulfate increment is only related to the nitrate denitrification with the theory ratio of reduction to generation being 1 7 54 moreover the sulfur disproportionation process was not obvious when only nitrate occurred in the wastewater wan et al 2019 it is calculated that the ratio of nitrate removal to sulfate formation at stage ii and stage iii are 1 10 25 and 1 9 58 the average per mg l 1 nitrate removal to sulfate formation of 9 92 mg l 1 at stage ii and stage iii respectively which are all higher than the theoretical value sulfate production was higher than the theoretical value indicating that sulfur oxidation and disproportionation occurred in scw coupled with autotrophic denitrification and it is worth mentioning that denitrification contributes more than 75 of the sulfate production in the scw under carbon limited conditions 3 6 3 microbial community analysis the alpha diversity of the microbial community is shown in table 2 chao 1 index of scw was increased indicating that the richness of the microbial community was improved with sulfur addition there was no significant difference between shannon and simpson indexes showing the similar microbial diversity between scw and cw microbial community compositions of scw and cw are illustrated in fig 8 at the phylum level microbial communities of scw and cw were nearly similar fig 8a top four dominant phylum were all proteobacteria chloroflexi bacteroidetes and acidobacteria accounting for over 80 of the total microbial relative abundance in all samples these phyla of microbes have been reported as typical ones performing both heterotrophic and autotrophic denitrification processes li et al 2020b yang et al 2021 especially proteobacteria have been reported to be the most dominant phylum that participated in the nitrogen and phosphorus removal process hoefel et al 2005 the higher relative abundance of proteobacteria in scw 29 42 indicated that nitrogen removal was promoted by sad in addition some sulfur oxidizing bacteria such as chloroflexus aggregans and oscillochloris trichoides were attributed to chloroflexi which can promote sad process grouzdev et al 2019 kanno et al 2019 at the class level fig 8b there was a significant difference in gammaproteobacteria between scw 22 90 and cw 10 17 due to sad p 0 05 which might be the most important contributors to the denitrification process chen et al 2018 at the genus level fig 8c thiobacillus sulfuritalea and geobacter all belonged to proteobacteria phylum where they were played an important role in sulfur oxidation it was found that thiobacillus the typical sulfur oxidizing bacteria wang et al 2019 was more enriched in the scw 2 64 which was significantly higher than that in cw 0 04 moreover the relative abundance of sulfuritalea in scw was 1 24 0 08 of cw which can oxidize thiosulfate sulfur and hydrogen using nitrate as electron acceptor kojima and fukui 2011 this confirmed the higher sad process in scw geobacter was also considered as the typical denitrifying genera for s0 reduction in wastewater treatment processes liang et al 2019 which might cooperate with other bacteria to complete nitrogen removal contrarily in scw 0 01 higher pseudonocardia relative abundance of in cw 1 53 suggested that heterotrophic ammoxidation might be occurred liu et al 2005 this may also can explain the possibility of better nitrification in cw the co occurrence networks of microbial communities in cws were constructed to explore the co occurrence patterns of network complexity where they were presented in fig 8d it was shown that the complexity of microbial correlation was followed as scw cw where the number of edges in scw 1247 was higher than that of cw 1236 the links of positive correlation were more significant than that of negative correlation indicating that the cooperative relationship between microorganisms was more significant than the competition the interaction relationship among microorganisms was altered by sulfur addition where the positive correlation in cw 60 76 was higher than in scw 56 94 the average clustering coefficient of scw was higher than that of cw indicating that the connection between nodes was closer in scw a more stable network was formed due to microorganism aggregation liu et al 2022 and the modularity of scw was higher than that of cw suggesting that a higher community structure order was mediated due to sulfur substrate intervention more connections tended to be concentrated in a few modules in scw 3 6 4 potential nitrogen metabolism mechanisms the potential nitrogen cycle s functional metabolic pathway in different cws was presented in fig 9 it had significant differences between scw and cw in the enzyme activity of n transformation p 0 05 specifically the denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction process was improved with the addition of sulfur which confirmed that denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction were the main nitrate reduction pathways in scw the relative abundance of nitrate reductase ec 1 7 5 1 nitrite reductase ec 1 7 2 1 and nitric oxide reductase ec 1 7 2 5 involved in the denitrification process were increased with 0 0795 0 0149 and 0 0198 in scw respectively nitrate was converted to nitrite by nitrate reductase which was generally driven by nitrate reduction related functional genes e g narg narh nari etc it was shown that the relative abundances of these functional genes in scw were all significantly higher than that in cw p 0 05 fig 9b and then nitrite was converted to no and n2o by nitrite reductase where the relative abundance of nirk in scw was also higher than that in cw it can be observed that the relative abundance of hydroxylamine reductase ec 1 7 99 1 was increased with the addition of sulfur in scw which might be an important reason for the high nh4 n concentration of effluent in scw the genes involved in the dissimilatory nitrate reduction nird and nitrogen fixation nifdhk processes in scw were higher than that in cw 4 conclusion element sulfur based autotrophic denitrification constructed wetland were operated to investigate nitrogen removal performance balance and removal pathway in this study results show that scw performed superior tn and nitrate removal performance than cw which might be due to effective autotrophic denitrification based on s0 the stronger resistance to influent with low c n was found in scw as c n decreased tan removal performance was not ideal in the separate scw operation mode with the average tan removal efficiency lower than 20 while the cw scw combined system can significantly improve the tan removal perforamnce sad is the primary mechanism of nitrogen removal in scw thiobacillus and sulfuritalea were considered to be the responsible affect the performance the elemental sulfur based denitrification process 9 92 mg of so4 2 would be produced as nitrate per mg removed which of them were attributed to the synergistic effect of autotrophic denitrification oxidation and sulfur disproportionation process therefore sulfur autotrophic integrated constructed

15368,free living amoebae are ubiquitous in the environment and cause both opportunistic and non opportunistic infections in humans some genera of amoebae are natural reservoirs of opportunistic plumbing pathogens such as legionella pneumophila in this study the presence of free living amoebae and legionella was investigated in 140 water and biofilm samples collected from australian domestic n 68 and hospital water systems n 72 each sample was screened in parallel using molecular and culture based methods direct quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr assays showed that 41 samples

acanthamoeba allovahlkampfia stenamoeba or v vermiformis v vermiformis showed the highest overall frequency of occurrence acanthamoeba and v vermiformis isolates demonstrated high thermotolerance and osmotolerance and strong broad spectrum bacteriogenic activity against gram negative and gram positive bacteria importantly all legionella positive samples were also positive for amoeba and this co occurrence was statistically significant p 0 05 according to qpcr and fluorescence in situ hybridization v vermiformis and allovahlkampfia harboured intracellular l pneumophila to our knowledge this is the first time allovahlkampfia and stenamoeba have been demonstrated as hosts of l pneumophila in potable water these results demonstrate the importance of amoebae in engineered water systems both as a pathogen and as a reservoir of legionella the high frequency of gymnamoebae detected in this study from australian engineered water systems identifies an issue of significant public health concern future water management protocols should incorporate treatments strategies to control amoebae to reduce the risk to end users graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords naked amoebae amoeba bacterium interactions opportunistic premise plumbing pathogens public health water quality engineered water system data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction gymnamoebae or naked amoebae are a group of free living aerobic amoeboid microorganisms which develop broad and smooth cytoplasmic projections known as pseudopodia page 1988 they are abundantly distributed in all types of environments these free living amoebae exist in two different physio morphological forms a metabolically active vegetative state called a trophozoite and a dormant state known as a cyst double layered cysts tolerate and resist environmental stresses including chemical and physical disinfection treatments dupuy et al 2014 acanthamoeba balamuthia naegleria vahlkampfia and vermamoeba vermiformis are important free living amoebae in terms of their effect on human health visvesvara et al 2007 these amoebae are etiological agents of human diseases and act like carriers of various pathogenic bacteria acanthamoeba is widely dispersed in nature and associated with different opportunistic and non opportunistic infections marciano cabral and cabral 2003 for example it has been identified as a causative agent of amoebic keratitis granulomatous amoebic encephalitis cutaneous and nasopharyngeal acanthamoebiasis in immunocompromised persons khan 2006 balamuthia mandrillaris is associated with fatal granulomatous amoebic encephalitis cutaneous and pulmonary infection in immunocompetent individuals matin et al 2008 naegleria fowleri the only known pathogenic species of the genus naegleria is a free living ameoboflagellate responsible for primary amoebic meningoencephalitis in healthy individuals visvesvara et al 2007 v vermiformis formerly known as hartmannella vermiformis is widely distributed in fresh surface water and described as an etiological agent of amoebic keratitis and meningoencephalitis centeno et al 1996 siddiqui et al 2021 free living amoebae are reservoirs and transmission vehicles of opportunistic premise plumbing pathogens oppps such as pseudomonas mycobacterium and legionella thomas and ashbolt 2011 these amoebae hosts protect oppps from physical and chemical disinfection procedures enabling long term contamination of manufactured water systems legionella is a medically important oppp with widespread distribution in natural and artificial aquatic environments bartram et al 2007 humans are an accidental host of legionella while the protozoan predators are its natural host boamah et al 2017 l pneumophila is the primary causative agent of legionellosis legionnaires disease and pontiac fever to date 80 distinct serogroups sg of this bacterium have been identified miyashita et al 2020 in the usa and europe 70 to 92 of the identified cases of legionellosis are associated with l pneumophila sg1 mercante and winchell 2015 the european legionnaires disease surveillance network has classified legionnaires disease into community hospital and travel acquired infections according to data collected in 2020 5 1 cases were associated with healthcare settings 7 8 were acquired via travelling and 66 9 cases were community acquired the european centre for disease prevention and control cooling towers shower heads tap faucets spas and hot water systems are major sources of l pneumophila contamination bartram et al 2007 as it is transmitted via inhalation or aspiration of l pneumophila contaminated aerosols or water prussin et al 2017 in hospital and domestic water systems acanthamoeba and v vermiformis are major reservoirs and vehicles of l pneumophila nisar et al 2020a symbiotic eukaryotic microbes biofilms and intrinsic resistance to disinfection treatment are the main biological factors influencing its survival and persistence nisar et al 2020a other abiotic factors such as flow dynamics stagnation dead end dead legs and plumbing material also influence the growth of legionella in engineered water systems nisar et al 2020b to our knowledge there are limited studies investigating free living amoebae in australian potable water and these mainly deal with the clinically important species acanthamoeba höllhumer et al 2020 and n fowleri puzon et al 2020 more broadly there are limited studies that examine the relationship between amoeba and legionella using both molecular and culture based methods concurrently nisar et al 2020a in this present study water and biofilm samples collected from different engineered water systems were screened for the presence of legionella and free living amoebae the culturable amoebae were characterized based on their physio morphologic stress tolerance and bacteriogenic features the presence of intracellular legionella was examined using qpcr and florescence in situ hybridization fish with rrna based oligonucleotide probes this approach enabled potentially new legionella hosts to be identified this is the first comprehensive study which used culturing and molecular tools for the characterization of free living amoebae and their association with legionella in australian hospital and domestic water systems 2

determine the association between co occurrence of legionella and free living amoebae the results were interpreted at the level of significance p 0 05 3 results 3 1 prevalence of legionella l pneumophila acanthamoeba and vermamoeba vermiformis gene markers legionella was present in 41 n 58 of samples within the range of shower water 1 102 to 2 8 106 gu l basin water 1 2 103 to 1 2 106 gu l and biofilm 40 to 7 4 104 gu ml l pneumophila was identified in 33 n 46 samples within the range of shower water 40 to 1 5 105 gu l basin water 4 7 102 to 1 8 104 gu l and biofilm 1 24 102 to 3 2 103 gu ml acanthamoeba and v vermiformis gene markers were detected in 11 n 15 and 55 n 77 of 140 hospital and domestic water samples that were analysed for these free living amoebae respectively in 10 of domestic n 10 and hospital n 4 samples v vermiformis co occurred with acanthamoeba the total gene marker count of acanthamoeba and v vermiformis was found to be significantly different in the sample types numbers of acanthamoeba varied from 40 to 9 4 102 gu ml and 2 1 102 to 1 7 104 gu l in the biofilm and shower water samples respectively the gene copy numbers of v vermiformis were 50 to 2 6 105 gu ml and 2 7 102 to 3 8 107 gu l in biofilm and shower water samples respectively in the basin water samples v vermiformis was found to be more abundant ranging from 2 7 104 to 7 4 107 gu l whereas acanthamoeba varied from 1 1 103 to 2 8 103 gu l table 1 presents the proportion of legionella l pneumophila acanthamoeba and v vermiformis contamination from hospital and domestic water systems 3 2 identification of culturable legionella from 59 domestic shower water samples eight were positive for culturable legionella of which six were identified as l pneumophila sg1 and two were l pneumophila sg2 14 in serological identification assays the domestic shower water isolates were found to be negative for legionella sp however they reacted positively in a serogrouping assay as either l pneumophila sg1 or l pneumophila sg2 14 this implies that the commercially available legionella latex agglutination assay does not always identify environmental legionella isolates of 58 hospital basin and shower water samples only two were positive for culturable legionella which were identified as non pneumophila legionella no culturable legionella was detected in the domestic and hospital biofilm samples finally through the qpcr assay all domestic shower water isolates were confirmed as harbouring l pneumophila whereas the legionella from both hospital water isolates were confirmed as non pneumophila legionella 3 3 culturable free living amoebae and morphotypes of the 140 samples 58 41 were found to be positive for culturable amoebae table 1 due to fungal overgrowth 22 were unable to develop monoxenic cultures of these seven showed acrasid amoebae like morphology therefore 36 monoxenic isolates were selected and processed for further studies fig 1 light microscopy of trophozoites revealed four distinct morphotypes 1 acanthopodial morphotypes locomotive form showing an acanthopodial morphotype n 1 that harboured acanthopodia flexible furcate and slender projections emerging from hyaloplasm for movement trophozoites 20 to 40 μm contained a single vesicular nucleus single and central nucleolus containing nucleus and one or two prominent contractile vacuoles the cytoplasm consisted of two distinct regions a granuloplasm dense granular region and a hyaloplasm translucent peripheral region fig 2 a and b in aqueous solution growth medium some motile trophozoites developed membrane bleb like protrusions in cysts 10 to 20 μm the intine inner wall and exine outer wall were well separated the intine consisted of 6 to 10 rays joined to exine at the end of rays fig 2 c these morphological characteristics are compatible with members of acanthamoeba group i page 1988 2 monotactic morphotype locomotive forms exhibiting a monotactic morphotype n 30 were elongated cylindrical non vahlkampfiid and worm like limax amoebae amoebae were predominantly monopodial single prominent tick and blunt pseudopodia fig 2 d only when a cell started changing direction of movement it developed discrete protruding lateral branches and or two or more pseudopodia fig 2 e during continuous locomotion they had a stable anterior hyaline cap clear and semi fluid portion front of the cytoplasm and maintained a clear fountain like flow of granuloplasm hyaloplasm granuloplasm transformation some motile cells harboured a posterior bulbous villous bulbous or an adhesive uroid mass of cytoplasm at posterior end acting like point of adhesion in some actively moving amoebae the length of the uroidal filament extended up to the cell length all trophozoites 15 to 45 μm were uninucleate and possessed a contractile vacuole situated at the posterior end the cysts 7 to 15 μm were spherical and consisted of distinctly separated inner and outer walls fig 2 f 3 lingulate morphotype locomotive forms demonstrating a lingulate morphotype n 2 were linguiform or oblong shaped amoebae fig 3 b occasionally adopting a flattened shape during non directed movements amoebae developed variable and irregular shapes and produced dactylopodia like structures finger like hyaline sub pseudopodia fig 3 c these motile cells did not harbour any prominent uroidal filaments non adherent floating cells formed multiple uneven pseudopods radiating from a central cell mass fig 3 a this state was very brief and it immediately settled down and continued locomotion trophozoites 15 to 35 μm contained a single vesicular nucleus and a prominent contractile vacuole at the posterior end the anterior part was broad and round whereas the posterior part was more granular the cysts 9 to 13 μm were double walled and spherical in shape fig 3 d two types of cyst walls were observed the inner wall closely attached to the outer wall and the inner wall were well separated in cysts of same clonal culture unlike other morphotypes in agar cultures during cyst formation trophozoites started active movement and developed a highly organized aggregate of cysts figs 1 e to h 4 eruptive morphotype locomotive form depicting an eruptive morphotype n 3 harboured typical vahlkampfiid morphology with eruptive lobopodia during locomotion an eruptive limax shape was predominant fig 3 e although a flabellate shape fan shaped translucent lobes developed regularly fig 3 g posterior end of the locomotive form also developed bulbous or adhesive uroidal structures fig 3 f non directionally moving amoebae developed a more compact shape and formed multiple eruptive lobopodia in different directions in these stationary cells the hyaloplasm developed a uniform layer at the peripheral region whereas the dorsal surface of the granuloplasm formed ridges and folds fig 3 g trophozoites 20 to 35 μm were mononucleated with vesicular nucleus and harboured a contractile vacuole located at the posterior terminus none of the cells developed a flagellate stage the cysts 7 to 15 μm were circular in shape and the inner cyst wall was closely attached to the outer wall fig 3 h in agar cultures amoebae formed two different types of aggregates trophozoites actively migrated and arranged themselves into loose mounds or multilayered amoebae aggregates figs 1 i and j during depletion of nutrients within aggregates the amoebae started forming cysts these cyst aggregates were not entrapped in any fruiting structure or sorocarp figs 1 k and l comprehensive microscopic examination of amoebae demonstrated that monotactic morphotype n 30 was widely distributed in engineered water systems 3 4 molecular identification of amoebae of the 36 monoxenic cultures 33 isolates successfully had their 18s rdna region sequenced table 2 identifying 29 as v vermiformis two as stenamoeba formerly known as platyamoeba one allovahlkampfia and one as acanthamoeba all hospital water system isolates were characterized as v vermiformis the percentage identity between the amoebae sequences from the present study and those taken as reference sequences from genbank ranged from 96 to 100 based on sequence analysis all v vermiformis isolates n 29 were closely related to each other regardless of the sampling point 3 5 thermotolerance and osmotolerance of amoebae growth kinetics of the isolates were studied at temperatures ranging from 25 c to 45 c table 2 the results indicated that allovahlkampfia was able to grow at 25 c but at 30 c it encysted all the v vermiformis isolates were able to grow at 30 c but unexpectedly five domestic and two hospital water system isolates were also able to grow at 45 c which explains their ability to proliferate in hot water systems for all amoebae isolates 35 c temperature significantly increased the doubling time and promoted encystment the ability of amoebae to encyst had been associated with their survival capacity page 1988 according to osmotolerance assays all isolates were able to grow on eco nna agar supplemented with 250 mm d mannitol except for allovahlkampfia using 500 mm d mannitol growth of stenamoeba and v vermiformis was reduced significantly and a large quantity of cysts was produced within four days interestingly three v vermiformis isolates not only grew at 40 c but also in the presence of 750 mm d mannitol indicating the pathogenic potential of these amoebae isolates more importantly acanthamoeba displayed growth in presence of 1 m d mannitol microscopic examination demonstrated that trophozoites growing in presence of 500 mm d mannitol were unable to maintain their typical cell shape and developed numerous vacuoles that occupied the entire granuloplasm 3 6 amoebae predation on pathogenic bacteria in this study 33 amoebae belonging to four different genera vermamoeba vermiformis stenamoeba allovahlkampfia and acanthamoeba were tested for their ability to feed on six different pathogenic gram positive and gram negative bacteria table 2 acanthamoeba n 1 and most of the v vermiformis n 21 isolates showed strong bacteriogenic activity against all test bacteria importantly these amoebae isolates showed similar bacteriogenic activities against both gram negative and gram positive bacteria overall their bactericidal effects were visible after 36 h however it was found that patterns of predation of v vermiformis isolated from hospital and domestic water systems differed v vermiformis from the domestic water system had the highest predation speed and formed large sized clearance zones after 72 h as compared to hospital water system isolates this showed that these acanthamoeba and v vermiformis isolates had a broad spectrum bacteriogenic activity and could consume different pathogenic bacteria similarly one of the stenamoeba isolates ds1 was more effective and able to consume a baumannii and p aeruginosa steadily but after 96 h further predation was halted allovahlkampfia did not consume gram negative bacteria during first 36 h however it was able to consume them during next 60 h allovahlkampfia and one of the stenamoeba isolate ds2 did not consume p aeruginosa and persisted in a cyst state even after 14 days of incubation table 2 shows the bacteriogenic activity of all amoebae isolates 3 7 legionella amoebae interactions a strong positive correlation was identified between the presence of legionella and amoebae table 3 all water and biofilm samples classified as positive for the legionella l pneumophila gene markers or culturable legionella l pneumophila were also positive for acanthamoeba v vermiformis gene marker or culturable amoebae analysis of these data using a pearson s chi squared test showed a significant positive association between legionella and amoebae acanthamoeba qpcr positive and legionella culture or qpcr positive χ2 7 047 p 0 008 v vermiformis qpcr positive and legionella culture or qpcr positive χ2 9 849 p 0 002 and culturable amoebae and legionella culture or qpcr positive χ2 9 7639 p 0 002 3 8 detection of intracellular l pneumophila thirty three amoebae isolates were analysed for the presence of intracellular legionella and l pneumophila three v vermiformis and one allovahlkampfia from domestic water systems showed the presence of intracellular l pneumophila using qpcr table 2 l pneumophila specific pcr positive amoebae cultures were subjected to fish assays and confocal microscopy in fish micrographs legionella appeared as green or yellow coloured cells localized inside red coloured v vermiformis and allovahlkampfia fig 4 these micrographs clearly demonstrated that legionella cells were closely clustered at the periphery as well as situated inside the cytoplasmic regions of the amoebae cells 4 discussion free living amoebae have direct and indirect public health significance not only are they associated with various deadly human diseases centeno et al 1996 khan 2006 marciano cabral and cabral 2003 matin et al 2008 siddiqui et al 2021 visvesvara et al 2007 they can also play a role as reservoirs of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria thomas and ashbolt 2011 to our knowledge this is the first comprehensive study conducted in australia that investigates the presence of free living amoebae in domestic and hospital water systems this revealed that the culture based amoebae detection method showed lower sensitivity with only 7 and 38 of qpcr positive acanthamoeba and v vermiformis samples able to grow on agar respectively unfortunately due to persistent fungal contamination 22 culturable amoebae were lost regardless the major advantage of culturing is to find and detect viable culturable amoebae a second advantage is that these amoebae isolates can be further characterized at the molecular level and screened for the presence of endosymbiotic microbes despite the availability of molecular techniques microscopic analysis of trophozoites and cysts is an effective method to identify amoebae morphotypes however morphological examination of trophozoites and cysts depends upon culturing conditions and varies within the same species visvesvara et al 2007 from this study it can be seen that application of all three techniques classical culturing microscopy and molecular profiling in combination is the most appropriate way to study freshwater free living amoebae morphological characterization demonstrated the presence of four distinct morphotypes acanthopodial monotactic lingulate and eruptive shown by acanthamoeba vermamoeba vermiformis stenamoeba and allovahlkampfia respectively fig 2 and 3 microscopic analysis of stenamoeba cultures delineated that as have been seen with vannella pentlandii on an agar plate a trophozoite climbed on the top of a cyst encysted itself and finally developed a three dimensional structure maciver et al 2017 similarly allovahlkampfia trophozoites clumped into multilayered or lose aggregates fig 1 i and j in the literature only loose aggregates of allovahlkampfia are mentioned de obeso fernández del valle and maciver 2017 so far the purpose of these types of aggregations in both stenamoeba and allovahlkampfia is not known clustering of cysts was also observed in the acanthamoeba culture but it was associated with some passive mechanism after cyst formation fig 1 b this study found that the genus vermamoeba vermiformis was more prevalent in domestic and australian hospital water systems than acanthamoeba this could be attributed to continuous decay and lower levels of residual disinfectants present at the point of water delivery tap or shower heads generally v vermiformis is more sensitive to disinfection procedures compared with acanthamoeba nisar et al 2020a a high percentage of v vermiformis and acanthamoeba in engineered water systems presents a public health risk for immunosuppressed individuals and contact lens users khan 2006 it has previously been seen that v vermiformis is present in sources of potable water rivers and lakes at concentrations ranging from 5 to 75 cells l kuiper et al 2006 whereas acanthamoeba is more prevalent in water treatment plants 43 and recreational hot water springs 47 5 ji et al 2014 garcia et al 2013 demonstrated that acanthamoeba 31 9 is more prevalent in those water reservoirs that have high levels of organic matter a comprehensive study conducted in two counties in ohio detected high prevalence of hartmannella 53 acanthamoeba 51 vahlkampfia 32 and naegleria 3 from household water samples stockman et al 2011 however in a study in the canary islands 59 5 of tap water samples were found to be contaminated with acanthamoeba lorenzo morales et al 2005 in another study conducted in australia within the greater sydney region based on morphological characteristics 29 of bathroom taps were positive for acanthamoeba carnt et al 2020 in this present study only 11 engineered water system samples were positive for acanthamoeba whereas 55 were positive for v vermiformis initially morphological analysis and pcr based screening studies were specifically designed to detect naegleria n fowleri and acanthamoeba from engineered water systems which may explain this discrepancy recently metagenomic analysis of faucet biofilm samples demonstrated that the most abundant eukaryotic microorganism is v vermiformis followed by acanthamoeba and echinamoeba liu et al 2012 similarly microbiome analysis of drinking water also showed v vermiformis as the most prominent eukaryotic microbe delafont et al 2016 delafont et al 2013 in our study v vermiformis is identified as the most abundant free living amoebae of hospital and domestic water systems tables 1 and 2 amoebae can also serve as an indicator for microbial water quality with a previous study showing that the total number of amoebae in a sample is directly related to the total number of bacteria anderson et al 2001 in conclusion our study demonstrates that hospital and domestic water systems in australia are also colonized by other plumbing system bacteria thermotolerance and osmotolerance assays are often used as indicators of pathogenic potential of free living amoebae generally amoebae capable of tolerating and proliferating at high temperatures and in hyperosmolar media are considered highly pathogenic khan et al 2001 the thermotolerance assay demonstrated that all isolates except allovahlkampfia remained viable and could reproduce at a temperature near human body temperature despite the high level of 18s rdna sequence similarity difference in thermotolerance and osmotolerance of v vermiformis isolates provided evidence of intraspecies variations the relationship between amoebae and bacteria is very complex and consists of a range of interactions including predation mutualism and parasitism shi et al 2021 naturally amoebae are predators that regulate the population of environmental microbes rodriguez zaragoza et al 2005 in predation amoebae track bacteria through chemotaxis and consume them via phagocytosis the main purpose of the bacterial predation assay was to determine whether domestic and hospital water amoebae could phagocytose medically important pathogenic bacteria phagocytosis is a complex phenomenon affected by multiple factors related to amoebae and bacteria generally amoebae prefer and migrate towards gram negative bacteria and non capsular bacteria bornier et al 2021 rashidi and ostrowski 2019 differences in the predatory kinetics of all studied four genera were noticeable twenty one v vermiformis and one acanthamoeba displayed strong bacteriogenic activity and ability to consume all test bacteria while allovahlkampfia did not show such activity initially stenamoeba showed very strong bacteriogenic activity against a baumannii and p aeruginosa but after 96 h it declined suggesting that further predation was stopped due to establishing an equilibrium this can be explained through the ability of a baumannii and p aeruginosa to promote encystment and cell death in amoebae hosts matz et al 2008 tamang et al 2011 naturally a baumannii k pneumoniae and s aureus synthesize protective polysaccharide layers bornier et al 2021 however predation kinetics suggested that this polysaccharide layer did not impact the bacteriogenic activity this study demonstrated that amoebae from domestic and hospital water systems can predate bacteria pathogenic to humans however further studies are required to explore these interactions in the natural environment legionella is an important plumbing premise pathogen and considered as indicator of water quality in engineered water systems zhang and lu 2021 surveys of legionella colonization of engineered water systems have been conducted in different parts of the world hayes phillips et al 2019 sikora et al 2015 stout et al 2007 in spain 37 2 water samples from 20 hospitals were contaminated with legionella and serotyping suggested coexistence of l pneumophila sg1 and l pneumophila sg2 14 sabrià et al 2004 in america national surveillance studies conducted in 13 different states demonstrated that 70 of hospital water systems were colonized with l pneumophila and l anisa additionally 30 of the water outlets in hospitals documenting hospital acquired legionellosis were contaminated with l pneumophila sg1 stout et al 2007 in taiwan 63 of hospital water systems were contaminated with legionella and l pneumophila sg1 was the most frequently recovered serogroup yu et al 2008 a study conducted in poland examined water samples from hospitals hotels industrial plants military barracks shopping centres and single mother homes showed the presence of l pneumophila in 74 77 of hot water samples in all of these tested samples l pneumophila sg2 14 was the more frequently detected serogroup sikora et al 2015 in a study conducted in hungary 60 of water samples taken from residential sites healthcare facilities educational and industrial buildings were colonized with legionella and l pneumophila sg2 14 was most prevalent serogroup barna et al 2016 a study conducted in italy found that 36 8 of water samples from sites in retirement homes and 10 3 in group homes were contaminated with legionella and l pneumophila sg1 was the most abundant serogroup de filippis et al 2018 in a recent study conducted in usa pcr assay demonstrated that 93 8 samples collected from chloraminated municipal drinking water distribution system were positive for legionella zhang and lu 2021 a recent study conducted in south australia detected legionella and l pneumophila gene markers in 74 6 and 64 2 domestic shower water samples respectively hayes phillips et al 2019 in this study qpcr assays showed that 41 samples were positive for legionella and 33 for l pneumophila gene markers table 1 only 7 samples were positive for culturable legionella obtained data suggests that both standard qpcr and culturing methods portray an incomplete picture and ignore viable but non culturable vbnc legionella and l pneumophila in engineered water systems amoebae exist and proliferates in both trophozoite and cyst forms zhang and lu 2021 the latter state protects intracellular legionella from adverse environmental conditions and prolonged disinfection treatments boamah et al 2017 dobrowsky et al 2016 kilvington and price 1990 inside amoebae legionella survive and proliferate within cytoplasmic vesicles acanthamoeba balamuthia dictyostelium echinamoeba naegleria paramecium tetrahymena and v vermiformis support intracellular multiplication of l pneumophila berk et al 2008 berk et al 1998 boamah et al 2017 fields et al 1989 nahapetian et al 1991 shadrach et al 2005 solomon et al 2000 watanabe et al 2016 trophozoites facilitate intracytoplasmic replication and biogenesis of potentially infectious and stress tolerant vbnc l pneumophila bouyer et al 2007 koubar et al 2011 nisar et al 2020a more importantly under favourable conditions these trophozoites permit transformation of vbnc cells into culturable l pneumophila epalle et al 2015 garcia et al 2007 steinert et al 1997 in return intracellular legionella increases the tolerance of its amoebae host against chemical and physical disinfection procedures nisar et al 2020a in vitro studies demonstrated that acanthamoeba polyphaga harbouring intracellular l pneumophila are more resistant against sodium hypochlorite treatment compared to uninfected protozoans garcia et al 2007 according to available literature allovahlkampfia spelaea supports intracellular proliferation of aeromonas hydrophila methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa mohamed et al 2016 in this study we directly detected intracellular l pneumophila from allovahlkampfia and v vermiformis fig 4 to our knowledge this is the first study documenting allovahlkampfia as a host of l pneumophila future research is needed to explore the use of these hosts in amoeba co culture assays used to detect vbnc legionella conza et al 2013 dey et al 2019 the chi squared test results on legionella and amoebae clearly demonstrated that in hospital and domestic water system legionella or l pneumophila always co occur with acanthamoeba or v vermiformis or other free living amoebae table 3 it also demonstrated that in engineered water system v vermiformis is host and carrier of legionella or l pneumophila this study has shown that in engineered water systems legionella co occurs with free living amoebae suggesting that colonisation of systems by free living amoebae may be a prerequisite for legionella colonisation based on their opportunistic nature and role as reservoirs of infectious bacteria gymnamoebae could be used as a water quality parameter in domestic and hospital water system these findings advocate the need to investigate the prevalence of free living amoebae in engineered water system globally and to design guidelines to safeguard the public health moreover there is a necessity to develop effective disinfection procedures to manage the amoebae contamination in engineered

15368,free living amoebae are ubiquitous in the environment and cause both opportunistic and non opportunistic infections in humans some genera of amoebae are natural reservoirs of opportunistic plumbing pathogens such as legionella pneumophila in this study the presence of free living amoebae and legionella was investigated in 140 water and biofilm samples collected from australian domestic n 68 and hospital water systems n 72 each sample was screened in parallel using molecular and culture based methods direct quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr assays showed that 41 samples were positive for legionella 33 for l pneumophila 11 for acanthamoeba and 55 for vermamoeba vermiformis gene markers only 7 of samples contained culturable l pneumophila serogroup sg 1 l pneumophila sg2 14 and non pneumophila legionella in total 69 of samples were positive for free living amoebae using any method standard culturing found that 41 of the samples were positive for amoeba either acanthamoeba allovahlkampfia stenamoeba or v vermiformis v vermiformis showed the highest overall frequency of occurrence acanthamoeba and v vermiformis isolates demonstrated high thermotolerance and osmotolerance and strong broad spectrum bacteriogenic activity against gram negative and gram positive bacteria importantly all legionella positive samples were also positive for amoeba and this co occurrence was statistically significant p 0 05 according to qpcr and fluorescence in situ hybridization v vermiformis and allovahlkampfia harboured intracellular l pneumophila to our knowledge this is the first time allovahlkampfia and stenamoeba have been demonstrated as hosts of l pneumophila in potable water these results demonstrate the importance of amoebae in engineered water systems both as a pathogen and as a reservoir of legionella the high frequency of gymnamoebae detected in this study from australian engineered water systems identifies an issue of significant public health concern future water management protocols should incorporate treatments strategies to control amoebae to reduce the risk to end users graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords naked amoebae amoeba bacterium interactions opportunistic premise plumbing pathogens public health water quality engineered water system data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction gymnamoebae or naked amoebae are a group of free living aerobic amoeboid microorganisms which develop broad and smooth cytoplasmic projections known as pseudopodia page 1988 they are abundantly distributed in all types of environments these free living amoebae exist in two different physio morphological forms a metabolically active vegetative state called a trophozoite and a dormant state known as a cyst double layered cysts tolerate and resist environmental stresses including chemical and physical disinfection treatments dupuy et al 2014 acanthamoeba balamuthia naegleria vahlkampfia and vermamoeba vermiformis are important free living amoebae in terms of their effect on human health visvesvara et al 2007 these amoebae are etiological agents of human diseases and act like carriers of various pathogenic bacteria acanthamoeba is widely dispersed in nature and associated with different opportunistic and non opportunistic infections marciano cabral and cabral 2003 for example it has been identified as a causative agent of amoebic keratitis granulomatous amoebic encephalitis cutaneous and nasopharyngeal acanthamoebiasis in immunocompromised persons khan 2006 balamuthia mandrillaris is associated with fatal granulomatous amoebic encephalitis cutaneous and pulmonary infection in immunocompetent individuals matin et al 2008 naegleria fowleri the only known pathogenic species of the genus naegleria is a free living ameoboflagellate responsible for primary amoebic meningoencephalitis in healthy individuals visvesvara et al 2007 v vermiformis formerly known as hartmannella vermiformis is widely distributed in fresh surface water and described as an etiological agent of amoebic keratitis and meningoencephalitis centeno et al 1996 siddiqui et al 2021 free living amoebae are reservoirs and transmission vehicles of opportunistic premise plumbing pathogens oppps such as pseudomonas mycobacterium and legionella thomas and ashbolt 2011 these amoebae hosts protect oppps from physical and chemical disinfection procedures enabling long term contamination of manufactured water systems legionella is a medically important oppp with widespread distribution in natural and artificial aquatic environments bartram et al 2007 humans are an accidental host of legionella while the protozoan predators are its natural host boamah et al 2017 l pneumophila is the primary causative agent of legionellosis legionnaires disease and pontiac fever to date 80 distinct serogroups sg of this bacterium have been identified miyashita et al 2020 in the usa and europe 70 to 92 of the identified cases of legionellosis are associated with l pneumophila sg1 mercante and winchell 2015 the european legionnaires disease surveillance network has classified legionnaires disease into community hospital and travel acquired infections according to data collected in 2020 5 1 cases were associated with healthcare settings 7 8 were acquired via travelling and 66 9 cases were community acquired the european centre for disease prevention and control cooling towers shower heads tap faucets spas and hot water systems are major sources of l pneumophila contamination bartram et al 2007 as it is transmitted via inhalation or aspiration of l pneumophila contaminated aerosols or water prussin et al 2017 in hospital and domestic water systems acanthamoeba and v vermiformis are major reservoirs and vehicles of l pneumophila nisar et al 2020a symbiotic eukaryotic microbes biofilms and intrinsic resistance to disinfection treatment are the main biological factors influencing its survival and persistence nisar et al 2020a other abiotic factors such as flow dynamics stagnation dead end dead legs and plumbing material also influence the growth of legionella in engineered water systems nisar et al 2020b to our knowledge there are limited studies investigating free living amoebae in australian potable water and these mainly deal with the clinically important species acanthamoeba höllhumer et al 2020 and n fowleri puzon et al 2020 more broadly there are limited studies that examine the relationship between amoeba and legionella using both molecular and culture based methods concurrently nisar et al 2020a in this present study water and biofilm samples collected from different engineered water systems were screened for the presence of legionella and free living amoebae the culturable amoebae were characterized based on their physio morphologic stress tolerance and bacteriogenic features the presence of intracellular legionella was examined using qpcr and florescence in situ hybridization fish with rrna based oligonucleotide probes this approach enabled potentially new legionella hosts to be identified this is the first comprehensive study which used culturing and molecular tools for the characterization of free living amoebae and their association with legionella in australian hospital and domestic water systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and processing the study was approved by the flinders university social and behavioural research ethics committee sbrec project number 7291 as per the recommendations of the national statement on ethical conduct in human research australia from february 2019 to november 2021 140 water and biofilm samples were collected from showers taps and tap faucets of domestic and hospital water systems these samples were collected from 35 different hospital and domestic buildings located in different municipalities of new south wales and south australia due to strict ethical policies authors cannot disclose the geographic location of the buildings when possible physical and environmental parameters were recorded during sampling this data along with climatic data from the australian bureau of meteorology 2022 is presented in table s2 water and biofilm samples were collected and transported according to the guidelines of the centers for disease

labelled probes were detected with λ source detector 470 510 nm channel all assays were done in triplicate and mean ct cycle threshold values were used for estimation of the genomic unit per litre gu l and genomic unit per millilitre gu ml to determine the presence of any pcr inhibitors in the extracted dna qpcr was performed on neat and 10 times diluted extracted dna if the mean ct value for the diluted sample was less than 3 3 than the extracted dna it was considered that the sample contained reaction inhibitors and the diluted sample 1 10 was used to estimate gu ml for biofilm samples or gu l for water samples hayes phillips et al 2019 the qpcr assays for both legionella and selected amoebae yielded a linear relationship between the ct and log gblock dna concentration the standard curves of legionella and l pneumophila revealed an 89 and 99 efficiency of the qpcr assay respectively the limit of detection for both legionella and l pneumophila was 35 gu reaction the standard curves of acanthamoeba and v vermiformis revealed an 81 and 75 efficiency of the qpcr assay respectively the limit of detection was 40 gu reaction for acanthamoeba and 44 gu reaction for v vermiformis the quantity of the legionella l pneumophila acanthamoeba and v vermiformis gene markers was subsequently estimated from shower water n 90 basin water n 27 and biofilm n 23 samples 2 3 isolation and

pseudomonas aeruginosa environmental isolate e faecium s aureus e coli and k pneumoniae were cultured on tryptone soya agar cm0131b oxoid ltd at 37 c for 24 h a baumannii and p aeruginosa were cultured on macconkey cm0007 oxoid ltd and cetrimide agar cm059 oxoid ltd respectively and incubated at 37 c for 24 h prior to this assay it was confirmed that these bacteria could survive on nna plates for 10 days for the predation assay one or two crescentic streaks of freshly grown bacteria diameter 15 mm were made on nna plates an amoebae agar block 10 mm was placed on the bacterial streak and incubated under aerobic conditions at 25 1 c for 5 to 10 days page 1988 to monitor amoebic growth and migration each plate was examined daily under a microscope after 24 h of incubation the clearance zone was measured to estimate the speed of predations 2 9 screening for intracellular legionella amoebae isolates were screened for the presence of intracellular legionella and l pneumophila by using two methods genus and species specific qpcr and fish assays in the qpcr assay according to the recommendations of iso ts12869 2019 the 16s rdna and mip genes were amplified to detect intracellular legionella and l pneumophila respectively international organization for standardization 2019 in the fish assay alexa fluor 647 labelled universal eukaryotic euk1209 and alexa fluor 488 labelled legionella leg705 fluorogenic probes invitrogen table s1 were used to visualize intra amoebic legionella amann et al 1990 manz et al 1995 whiley et al 2011 briefly paraformaldehyde fixed cells were dehydrated in a 50 80 and 96 ethanol series to these cells 200 µl hybridization buffer 0 01 sds 900 mm nacl and 20 mm tris hcl ph 7 6 containing 100 ng of each fluorogenic probe was applied and incubated at 55 1 c for 100 min after washing and drying citifluor af1 17970 25 electron microscopy sciences was used for mounting and images were captured using confocal microscopy lsm 880 fast airyscan confocal zeiss 2 10 statistical analysis data analyses were performed using spss software and an online calculator https www socscistatistics com pearson s chi squared test was used to determine the association between co occurrence of legionella and free living amoebae the results were interpreted at the level of significance p 0 05 3 results 3 1 prevalence of legionella l pneumophila acanthamoeba and vermamoeba vermiformis gene markers legionella was present in 41 n 58 of samples within the range of shower water 1 102 to 2 8 106 gu l basin water 1 2 103 to 1 2 106 gu l and biofilm 40 to 7 4 104 gu ml l pneumophila was identified in 33 n 46 samples within the range of shower water 40 to 1 5 105 gu l basin water 4 7 102 to 1 8 104 gu l and biofilm 1 24 102 to 3 2 103 gu ml acanthamoeba and v vermiformis gene markers were detected in 11 n 15 and 55 n 77 of 140 hospital and domestic water samples that were analysed for these free living amoebae respectively in 10 of domestic n 10 and hospital n 4 samples v vermiformis co occurred with acanthamoeba the total gene marker count of acanthamoeba and v vermiformis was found to be significantly different in the sample types numbers of acanthamoeba varied from 40 to 9 4 102 gu ml and 2 1 102 to 1 7 104 gu l in the biofilm and shower water samples respectively the gene copy numbers of v vermiformis were 50 to 2 6 105 gu ml and 2 7 102 to 3 8 107 gu l in biofilm and shower water samples respectively in the basin water samples v vermiformis was found to be more abundant ranging from 2 7 104 to 7 4 107 gu l whereas acanthamoeba varied from 1 1 103 to 2 8 103 gu l table 1 presents the proportion of legionella l pneumophila acanthamoeba and v vermiformis contamination from hospital and domestic water systems 3 2 identification of culturable legionella from 59 domestic shower water samples eight were positive for culturable legionella of which six were identified as l pneumophila sg1 and two were l pneumophila sg2 14 in serological identification assays the domestic shower water isolates were found to be negative for legionella sp however they reacted positively in a serogrouping assay as either l pneumophila sg1 or l pneumophila sg2 14 this implies that the commercially available legionella latex agglutination assay does not always identify environmental legionella isolates of 58 hospital basin and shower water samples only two were positive for culturable legionella which were identified as non pneumophila legionella no culturable legionella was detected in the domestic and hospital biofilm samples finally through the qpcr assay all domestic shower water isolates were confirmed as harbouring l pneumophila whereas the legionella from both hospital water isolates were confirmed as non pneumophila legionella 3 3 culturable free living amoebae and morphotypes of the 140 samples 58 41 were found to be positive for culturable amoebae table 1 due to fungal overgrowth 22 were unable to develop monoxenic cultures of these seven showed acrasid amoebae like morphology therefore 36 monoxenic isolates were selected and processed for further studies fig 1 light microscopy of trophozoites revealed four distinct morphotypes 1 acanthopodial morphotypes locomotive form showing an acanthopodial morphotype n 1 that harboured acanthopodia flexible furcate and slender projections emerging from hyaloplasm for movement trophozoites 20 to 40 μm contained a single vesicular nucleus single and central nucleolus containing nucleus and one or two prominent contractile vacuoles the cytoplasm consisted of two distinct regions a granuloplasm dense granular region and a hyaloplasm translucent peripheral region fig 2 a and b in aqueous solution growth medium some motile trophozoites developed membrane bleb like protrusions in cysts 10 to 20 μm the intine inner wall and exine outer wall were well separated the intine consisted of 6 to 10 rays joined to exine at the end of rays fig 2 c these morphological characteristics are compatible with members of acanthamoeba group i page 1988 2 monotactic morphotype locomotive forms exhibiting a monotactic morphotype n 30 were elongated cylindrical non vahlkampfiid and worm like limax amoebae amoebae were predominantly monopodial single prominent tick and blunt pseudopodia fig 2 d only when a cell started changing direction of movement it developed discrete protruding lateral branches and or two or more pseudopodia fig 2 e during continuous locomotion they had a stable anterior hyaline cap clear and semi fluid portion front of the cytoplasm and maintained a clear fountain like flow of granuloplasm hyaloplasm granuloplasm transformation some motile cells harboured a posterior bulbous villous bulbous or an adhesive uroid mass of cytoplasm at posterior end acting like point of adhesion in some actively moving amoebae the length of the uroidal filament extended up to the cell length all trophozoites 15 to 45 μm were uninucleate and possessed a contractile vacuole situated at the posterior end the cysts 7 to 15 μm were spherical and consisted of distinctly separated inner and outer walls fig 2 f 3 lingulate morphotype locomotive forms demonstrating a lingulate morphotype n 2 were linguiform or oblong shaped amoebae fig 3 b occasionally adopting a flattened shape during non directed movements amoebae developed variable and irregular shapes and produced dactylopodia like structures finger like hyaline sub pseudopodia fig 3 c these motile cells did not harbour any prominent uroidal filaments non adherent floating cells formed multiple uneven pseudopods radiating from a central cell mass fig 3 a this state was very brief and it immediately settled down and continued locomotion trophozoites 15 to 35 μm contained a single vesicular nucleus and a prominent contractile vacuole at the posterior end the anterior part was broad and round whereas the posterior part was more granular the cysts 9 to 13 μm were double walled and spherical in shape fig 3 d two types of cyst walls were observed the inner wall closely attached to the outer wall and the inner wall were well separated in cysts of same clonal culture unlike other morphotypes in agar cultures during cyst formation trophozoites started active movement and developed a highly organized aggregate of cysts figs 1 e to h 4 eruptive morphotype locomotive form depicting an eruptive morphotype n 3 harboured typical vahlkampfiid morphology with eruptive lobopodia during locomotion an eruptive limax shape was predominant fig 3 e although a flabellate shape fan shaped translucent lobes developed regularly fig 3 g posterior end of the locomotive form also developed bulbous or adhesive uroidal structures fig 3 f non directionally moving amoebae developed a more compact shape and formed multiple eruptive lobopodia in different directions in these stationary cells the hyaloplasm developed a uniform layer at the peripheral region whereas the dorsal surface of the granuloplasm formed ridges and folds fig 3 g trophozoites 20 to 35 μm were mononucleated with vesicular nucleus and harboured a contractile vacuole located at the posterior terminus none of the cells developed a flagellate stage the cysts 7 to 15 μm were circular in shape and the inner cyst wall was closely attached to the outer wall fig 3 h in agar cultures amoebae formed two different types of aggregates trophozoites actively migrated and arranged themselves into loose mounds or multilayered amoebae aggregates figs 1 i and j during depletion of nutrients within aggregates the amoebae started forming cysts these cyst aggregates were not entrapped in any fruiting structure or sorocarp figs 1 k and l comprehensive microscopic examination of amoebae demonstrated that monotactic morphotype n 30 was widely distributed in engineered water systems 3 4 molecular identification of amoebae of the 36 monoxenic cultures 33 isolates successfully had their 18s rdna region sequenced table 2 identifying 29 as v vermiformis two as stenamoeba formerly known as platyamoeba one allovahlkampfia and one as acanthamoeba all hospital water system isolates were characterized as v vermiformis the percentage identity between the amoebae sequences from the present study and those taken as reference sequences from genbank ranged from 96 to 100 based on sequence analysis all v vermiformis isolates n 29 were closely related to each other regardless of the sampling point 3 5 thermotolerance and osmotolerance of amoebae growth kinetics of the isolates were studied at temperatures ranging from 25 c to 45 c table 2 the results indicated that allovahlkampfia was able to grow at 25 c but at 30 c it encysted all the v vermiformis isolates were able to grow at 30 c but unexpectedly five domestic and two hospital water system isolates were also able to grow at 45 c which explains their ability to proliferate in hot water systems for all amoebae isolates 35 c temperature significantly increased the doubling time and promoted encystment the ability of amoebae to encyst had been associated with their survival capacity page 1988 according to osmotolerance assays all isolates were able to grow on eco nna agar supplemented with 250 mm d mannitol except for allovahlkampfia using 500 mm d mannitol growth of stenamoeba and v vermiformis was reduced significantly and a large quantity of cysts was produced within four days interestingly three v vermiformis isolates not only grew at 40 c but also in the presence of 750 mm d mannitol indicating the pathogenic potential of these amoebae isolates more importantly acanthamoeba displayed growth in presence of 1 m d mannitol microscopic examination demonstrated that trophozoites growing in presence of 500 mm d mannitol were unable to maintain their typical cell shape and developed numerous vacuoles that occupied the entire granuloplasm 3 6 amoebae predation on pathogenic bacteria in this study 33 amoebae belonging to four different genera vermamoeba vermiformis stenamoeba allovahlkampfia and acanthamoeba were tested for their ability to feed on six different pathogenic gram positive and gram negative bacteria table 2 acanthamoeba n 1 and most of the v vermiformis n 21 isolates showed strong bacteriogenic activity against all test bacteria importantly these amoebae isolates showed similar bacteriogenic activities against both gram negative and gram positive bacteria overall their bactericidal effects were visible after 36 h however it was found that patterns of predation of v vermiformis isolated from hospital and domestic water systems differed v vermiformis from the domestic water system had the highest predation speed and formed large sized clearance zones after 72 h as compared to hospital water system isolates this showed that these acanthamoeba and v vermiformis isolates had a broad spectrum bacteriogenic activity and could consume different pathogenic bacteria similarly one of the stenamoeba isolates ds1 was more effective and able to consume a baumannii and p aeruginosa steadily but after 96 h further predation was halted allovahlkampfia did not consume gram negative bacteria during first 36 h however it was able to consume them during next 60 h allovahlkampfia and one of the stenamoeba isolate ds2 did not consume p aeruginosa and persisted in a cyst state even after 14 days of incubation table 2 shows the bacteriogenic activity of all amoebae isolates 3 7 legionella amoebae interactions a strong positive correlation was identified between the presence of legionella and amoebae table 3 all water and biofilm samples classified as positive for the legionella l pneumophila gene markers or culturable legionella l pneumophila were also positive for acanthamoeba v vermiformis gene marker or culturable amoebae analysis of these data using a pearson s chi squared test showed a significant positive association between legionella and amoebae acanthamoeba qpcr positive and legionella culture or qpcr positive χ2 7 047 p 0 008 v vermiformis qpcr positive and legionella culture or qpcr positive χ2 9 849 p 0 002 and culturable amoebae and legionella culture or qpcr positive χ2 9 7639 p 0 002 3 8 detection of intracellular l pneumophila thirty three amoebae isolates were analysed for the presence of intracellular legionella and l pneumophila three v vermiformis and one allovahlkampfia from domestic water systems showed the presence of intracellular l pneumophila using qpcr table 2 l pneumophila specific pcr positive amoebae cultures were subjected to fish assays and confocal microscopy in fish micrographs legionella appeared as green or yellow coloured cells localized inside red coloured v vermiformis and allovahlkampfia fig 4 these micrographs clearly demonstrated that legionella cells were closely clustered at the periphery as well as situated inside the cytoplasmic regions of the amoebae cells 4 discussion free living amoebae have direct and indirect public health significance not only are they associated with various deadly human diseases centeno et al 1996 khan 2006 marciano cabral and cabral 2003 matin et al 2008 siddiqui et al 2021 visvesvara et al 2007 they can also play a role as reservoirs of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria thomas and ashbolt 2011 to our knowledge this is the first comprehensive study conducted in australia that investigates the presence of free living amoebae in domestic and hospital water systems this revealed that the culture based amoebae detection method showed lower sensitivity with only 7 and 38 of qpcr positive acanthamoeba and v vermiformis samples able to grow on agar respectively unfortunately due to persistent fungal contamination 22 culturable amoebae were lost regardless the major advantage of culturing is to find and detect viable culturable amoebae a second advantage is that these amoebae isolates can be further characterized at the molecular level and screened for the presence of endosymbiotic microbes despite the availability of molecular techniques microscopic analysis of trophozoites and cysts is an effective method to identify amoebae morphotypes however morphological examination of trophozoites and cysts depends upon culturing conditions and varies within the same species visvesvara et al 2007 from this study it can be seen that application of all three techniques classical culturing microscopy and molecular profiling in combination is the most appropriate way to study freshwater free living amoebae morphological characterization demonstrated the presence of four distinct morphotypes acanthopodial monotactic lingulate and eruptive shown by acanthamoeba vermamoeba vermiformis stenamoeba and allovahlkampfia respectively fig 2 and 3 microscopic analysis of stenamoeba cultures delineated that as have been seen with vannella pentlandii on an agar plate a trophozoite climbed on the top of a cyst encysted itself and finally developed a three dimensional structure maciver et al 2017 similarly allovahlkampfia trophozoites clumped into multilayered or lose aggregates fig 1 i and j in the literature only loose aggregates of allovahlkampfia are mentioned de obeso fernández del valle and maciver 2017 so far the purpose of these types of aggregations in both stenamoeba and allovahlkampfia is not known clustering of cysts was also observed in the acanthamoeba culture but it was associated with some passive mechanism after cyst formation fig 1 b this study found that the genus vermamoeba vermiformis was more prevalent in domestic and australian hospital water systems than acanthamoeba this could be attributed to continuous decay and lower levels of residual disinfectants present at the point of water delivery tap or shower heads generally v vermiformis is more sensitive to disinfection procedures compared with acanthamoeba nisar et al 2020a a high percentage of v vermiformis and acanthamoeba in engineered water systems presents a public health risk for immunosuppressed individuals and contact lens users khan 2006 it has previously been seen that v vermiformis is present in sources of potable water rivers and lakes at concentrations ranging from 5 to 75 cells l kuiper et al 2006 whereas acanthamoeba is more prevalent in water treatment plants 43 and recreational hot water springs 47 5 ji et al 2014 garcia et al 2013 demonstrated that acanthamoeba 31 9 is more prevalent in those water reservoirs that have high levels of organic matter a comprehensive study conducted in two counties in ohio detected high prevalence of hartmannella 53 acanthamoeba 51 vahlkampfia 32 and naegleria 3 from household water samples stockman et al 2011 however in a study in the canary islands 59 5 of tap water samples were found to be contaminated with acanthamoeba lorenzo morales et al 2005 in another study conducted in australia within the greater sydney region based on morphological characteristics 29 of bathroom taps were positive for acanthamoeba carnt et al 2020 in this present study only 11 engineered water system samples were positive for acanthamoeba whereas 55 were positive for v vermiformis initially morphological analysis and pcr based screening studies were specifically designed to detect naegleria n fowleri and acanthamoeba from engineered water systems which may explain this discrepancy recently metagenomic analysis of faucet biofilm samples demonstrated that the most abundant eukaryotic microorganism is v vermiformis followed by acanthamoeba and echinamoeba liu et al 2012 similarly microbiome analysis of drinking water also showed v vermiformis as the most prominent eukaryotic microbe delafont et al 2016 delafont et al 2013 in our study v vermiformis is identified as the most abundant free living amoebae of hospital and domestic water systems tables 1 and 2 amoebae can also serve as an indicator for microbial water quality with a previous study showing that the total number of amoebae in a sample is directly related to the total number of bacteria anderson et al 2001 in conclusion our study demonstrates that hospital and domestic water systems in australia are also colonized by other plumbing system bacteria thermotolerance and osmotolerance assays are often used as indicators of pathogenic potential of free living amoebae generally amoebae capable of tolerating and proliferating at high temperatures and in hyperosmolar media are considered highly pathogenic khan et al 2001 the thermotolerance assay demonstrated that all isolates except allovahlkampfia remained viable and could reproduce at a temperature near human body temperature despite the high level of 18s rdna sequence similarity difference in thermotolerance and osmotolerance of v vermiformis isolates provided evidence of intraspecies variations the relationship between amoebae and bacteria is very complex and consists of a range of interactions including predation mutualism and parasitism shi et al 2021 naturally amoebae are predators that regulate the population of environmental microbes rodriguez zaragoza et al 2005 in predation amoebae track bacteria through chemotaxis and consume them via phagocytosis the main purpose of the bacterial predation assay was to determine whether domestic and hospital water amoebae could phagocytose medically important pathogenic bacteria phagocytosis is a complex phenomenon affected by multiple factors related to amoebae and bacteria generally amoebae prefer and migrate towards gram negative bacteria and non capsular bacteria bornier et al 2021 rashidi and ostrowski 2019 differences in the predatory kinetics of all studied four genera were noticeable twenty one v vermiformis and one acanthamoeba displayed strong bacteriogenic activity and ability to consume all test bacteria while allovahlkampfia did not show such activity initially stenamoeba showed very strong bacteriogenic activity against a baumannii and p aeruginosa but after 96 h it declined suggesting that further predation was stopped due to establishing an equilibrium this can be explained through the ability of a baumannii and p aeruginosa to promote encystment and cell death in amoebae hosts matz et al 2008 tamang et al 2011 naturally a baumannii k pneumoniae and s aureus synthesize protective polysaccharide layers bornier et al 2021 however predation kinetics suggested that this polysaccharide layer did not impact the bacteriogenic activity this study demonstrated that amoebae from domestic and hospital water systems can predate bacteria pathogenic to humans however further studies are required to explore these interactions in the natural environment legionella is an important plumbing premise pathogen and considered as indicator of water quality in engineered water systems zhang and lu 2021 surveys of legionella colonization of engineered water systems have been conducted in different parts of the world hayes phillips et al 2019 sikora et al 2015 stout et al 2007 in spain 37 2 water samples from 20 hospitals were contaminated with legionella and serotyping suggested coexistence of l pneumophila sg1 and l pneumophila sg2 14 sabrià et al 2004 in america national surveillance studies conducted in 13 different states demonstrated that 70 of hospital water systems were colonized with l pneumophila and l anisa additionally 30 of the water outlets in hospitals documenting hospital acquired legionellosis were contaminated with l pneumophila sg1 stout et al 2007 in taiwan 63 of hospital water systems were contaminated with legionella and l pneumophila sg1 was the most frequently recovered serogroup yu et al 2008 a study conducted in poland examined water samples from hospitals hotels industrial plants military barracks shopping centres and single mother homes showed the presence of l pneumophila in 74 77 of hot water samples in all of these tested samples l pneumophila sg2 14 was the more frequently detected serogroup sikora et al 2015 in a study conducted in hungary 60 of water samples taken from residential sites healthcare facilities educational and industrial buildings were colonized with legionella and l pneumophila sg2 14 was most prevalent serogroup barna et al 2016 a study conducted in italy found that 36 8 of water samples from sites in retirement homes and 10 3 in group homes were contaminated with legionella and l pneumophila sg1 was the most abundant serogroup de filippis et al 2018 in a recent study conducted in usa pcr assay demonstrated that 93 8 samples collected from chloraminated municipal drinking water distribution system were positive for legionella zhang and lu 2021 a recent study conducted in south australia detected legionella and l pneumophila gene markers in 74 6 and 64 2 domestic shower water samples respectively hayes phillips et al 2019 in this study qpcr assays showed that 41 samples were positive for legionella and 33 for l pneumophila gene markers table 1 only 7 samples were positive for culturable legionella obtained data suggests that both standard qpcr and culturing methods portray an incomplete picture and ignore viable but non culturable vbnc legionella and l pneumophila in engineered water systems amoebae exist and proliferates in both trophozoite and cyst forms zhang and lu 2021 the latter state protects intracellular legionella from adverse environmental conditions and prolonged disinfection treatments boamah et al 2017 dobrowsky et al 2016 kilvington and price 1990 inside amoebae legionella survive and proliferate within cytoplasmic vesicles acanthamoeba balamuthia dictyostelium echinamoeba naegleria paramecium tetrahymena and v vermiformis support intracellular multiplication of l pneumophila berk et al 2008 berk et al 1998 boamah et al 2017 fields et al 1989 nahapetian et al 1991 shadrach et al 2005 solomon et al 2000 watanabe et al 2016 trophozoites facilitate intracytoplasmic replication and biogenesis of potentially infectious and stress tolerant vbnc l pneumophila bouyer et al 2007 koubar et al 2011 nisar et al 2020a more importantly under favourable conditions these trophozoites permit transformation of vbnc cells into culturable l pneumophila epalle et al 2015 garcia et al 2007 steinert et al 1997 in return intracellular legionella increases the tolerance of its amoebae host against chemical and physical disinfection procedures nisar et al 2020a in vitro studies demonstrated that acanthamoeba polyphaga harbouring intracellular l pneumophila are more resistant against sodium hypochlorite treatment compared to uninfected protozoans garcia et al 2007 according to available literature allovahlkampfia spelaea supports intracellular proliferation of aeromonas hydrophila methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa mohamed et al 2016 in this study we directly detected intracellular l pneumophila from allovahlkampfia and v vermiformis fig 4 to our knowledge this is the first study documenting allovahlkampfia as a host of l pneumophila future research is needed to explore the use of these hosts in amoeba co culture assays used to detect vbnc legionella conza et al 2013 dey et al 2019 the chi squared test results on legionella and amoebae clearly demonstrated that in hospital and domestic water system legionella or l pneumophila always co occur with acanthamoeba or v vermiformis or other free living amoebae table 3 it also demonstrated that in engineered water system v vermiformis is host and carrier of legionella or l pneumophila this study has shown that in engineered water systems legionella co occurs with free living amoebae suggesting that colonisation of systems by free living amoebae may be a prerequisite for legionella colonisation based on their opportunistic nature and role as reservoirs of infectious bacteria gymnamoebae could be used as a water quality parameter in domestic and hospital water system these findings advocate the need to investigate the prevalence of free living amoebae in engineered water system globally and to design guidelines to safeguard the public health moreover there is a necessity to develop effective disinfection procedures to manage the amoebae contamination in engineered

15369,vanadium v is a transitional metal that poses health risks to exposed humans microorganisms play an important role in remediating v contamination by reducing more toxic and mobile vanadate v v to less toxic and mobile v iv in this study dna stable isotope probing sip coupled with metagenomic binning was used to identify microorganisms responsible for v v reduction and determine potential metabolic mechanisms in cultures inoculated with a v contaminated river sediment anaeromyxobacter and geobacter spp were identified as putative v v reducing bacteria while methanosarcina spp were identified as putative v v reducing archaea the bacteria may use the two nitrate reductases narg and napa for respiratory v v reduction as has been demonstrated previously for other species it is proposed that methanosarcina spp may reduce v v via anaerobic methane oxidation pathways aom v rather than via respiratory v v reduction performed by their bacterial counterparts as indicated by the presence of genes associated with anaerobic methane oxidation coupled with metal reduction in the metagenome assembled genome mag of methanosarcina briefly methane may be oxidized through the reverse methanogenesis pathway to produce electrons which may be further captured by v v to promote v v reduction more specially v v reduction by members of methanosarcina may be driven by electron transport coms scob heterodisulfide reductase hdrde f420h2 dehydrogenases fpo and multi heme c type cytochrome mhc the identification of putative v v reducing bacteria and archaea and the prediction of their different pathways for v v reduction expand current knowledge regarding the potential fate of v v in contaminated sites graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords vanadium contamination stable isotope probing metagenomic binning anaerobic methane oxidation data availability the sequencing data has been deposited in ncbi database and the accession number has been provided in the manucsript 1 introduction vanadium v is a transition metal with excellent catalytic ability and has been widely used in iron and steel industry pharmaceutical engineering ceramics aviation and nuclear technology zhang et al 2021a severe environmental contamination by v has been recorded with the increasing industrial applications for instance the concentration of v in soil around v smelting plants can reach over 5000 mg kg 65 times higher than the background level of v in chinese soils 82 mg kg wang et al 2020 vanadium concentrations as high as 0 77 mg l in groundwater were observed in rifle usa ortiz bernad et al 2004 vanadium naturally occurs in three oxidation states v v v vi and v iii huang et al 2015 v v is the most toxic and mobile form v iv by contrast is less toxic and usually exists as precipitates under neutral or alkaline conditions he et al 2021 yelton et al 2013 thus reduction of v v to v vi is a feasible way to alleviate v contamination compared to physical and chemical treatment v v reduction mediated by microorganisms is considered as a promising bioremediation strategy due to its potentially low cost and environment friendly nature zhang et al 2020a microorganisms play an important role in v v reduction in soils and water hao et al 2021 wang et al 2020 to date a limited number of v v reducing bacteria have been isolated including shewanella oneidensis carpentier et al 2003 shewanella loihica pv 4 wang et al 2017 geobacter metallireducens ortiz bernad et al 2004 and lactococcus raffinolactis zhang et al 2021a recently some v v reducing bacteria have been identified in complex microbial systems for example bacillus and thauera spp were suggested to reduce v v in v contaminated soil zhang et al 2019 methylomonas and denitratisoma were recognized as v v reducing bacteria in a membrane biofilm reactor using ch4 as the sole electron donor lai et al 2018a some studies have investigated the genes associated with v v reduction to clarify the mechanisms of v v reduction for instance sun et al reported that polaromonas spp encoded narg for v v reduction sun et al 2020 the nitrate reductase gene napa was reported as the key gene in autotrophic v v reduction he et al 2021 in addition to bacterial v v reducers archaea are also capable of v v reduction a mesophilic methanosarcina mazei and a thermophilic methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus were found to reduce v v to v iv using acetate and h2 as electron donors respectively zhang et al 2014 in another study methanosarcina were significantly enriched in a membrane biofilm batch reactor and was proposed to be responsible for v v reduction wang et al 2019b owing to the limitation of culture dependent techniques our understanding of v v reducing microorganisms especially for archaea which are more difficult to culture and isolate remains limited stable isotope probing sip can link members of microbial communities with their functions without isolation dumont and murrell 2005 the combination of sip and metagenomics can identify the key microorganisms responsible for a specific biogeochemical process and predict their potential metabolisms dna sip has been used to identify microorganisms responsible for metal oid transformations such as as and sb cycling and fe iii and mn iv reduction hori et al 2010 sun et al 2022 vandieken et al 2012 xu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b in addition the combination of dna sip and metagenomics has been used to uncover mechanisms for metal cycling sun et al 2022 for example the combination of dna sip metagenomic binning and pangenomics suggested that bacteria associated with geobacter and pseudomonas were active in sb v reduction and arra and anra were the key genes responsible for the process sun et al 2021 the combination of metagenomic binning may be able to reveal the microbial mechanisms for v v reduction therefore the present study aimed to identify v reducing microorganisms in a contaminated riverine ecosystem and predict their mechanisms of v reduction anaerobic cultures were established to estimate v v reduction using a long term v contaminated sediment as the inoculum dna sip was used to identify v reducing microorganisms in sediment cultures followed by metagenomic binning to evaluate their metabolic potential and predict the key genes and pathways for v v reduction 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and characterization a v contaminated sediment sample was collected at 0 10 cm depth from a river that passes through an active mine at lengshuijiang china 27 43 0 n 111 27 3 e the sample was immediately transported to the laboratory at 4 and stored at 20 until use to determine v concentrations the sample was digested with a microwave and measured by an icp oes vista mpx varian for the geochemical properties of sediment the measurements followed protocols as previously described xu et al 2020 li et al 2022b 2 2 anaerobic incubation two sets of incubations were established one to characterize the activity of v v reduction designed as v v reduction activity incubation hereafter and another to identify the populations involved in v reduction by dna sip analysis designed as sip incubation hereafter 2 2 1 v reduction activity incubation for each culture bottle approximately 2 g of sediment was inoculated in a 120 ml sterilized serum bottle with 100 ml of mineral salts medium msm zhang et al 2015 the medium was then purged with n2 for 30 min and sealed with stopper and aluminum caps the gas in the headspace of bottle was replaced by purging with n2 co2 80 20 v v for a further 10 min the sediment slurries were preincubated at room temperature for 10 to 14 days to deplete indigenous electron donors i e organic matters and electron acceptors i e o2 fe iii and nitrate after the preincubation the supernatant was replaced with fresh msm and the headspace gas was purged with n2 for further incubation three different sets of treatments were established in triplicate for each of the treatment with the following amendments 1 50 mg l v v and 5 mm acetic acid 2 50 mg l v v only 3 and 5 mm acetic acid only autoclaved killed controls were also established with 50 mg l v v and 5 mm acetic acid addition all cultures were incubated statically at 30 during the incubation the reduction of v v was monitored every four days and the cultures were amended with 50 mg l v v and 5 mm acetic acid again after the complete removal of v v aqueous samples were collected and filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane the concentration of v v was measured using a spectrophotometric method carpentier et al 2003 2 2 2 sip incubation dna sip was performed to target putative v reducing microorganisms using 13c labeled acetic acid as carbon source the sip incubation was prepared by inoculating 2 g sediment into 100 ml of msm the cultures were then purged and sealed as described above the treatments for sip experiments were established as follow the

duplicate cultures destructively sampled at days 4 8 and 16 2 3 dna extraction and dna sip gradient fractionation genomic dna was extracted from 0 25 g of sediment collected from the sip incubations at days 4 8 and 16 using the dneasy powersoil dna kit qiagen germany the 13c dna and 12c dna were separated into heavy and light fractions by cscl gradient ultracentrifugation following previous protocols sun and cupples 2012 zhang et al 2020b briefly approximately 2 μg of dna was provided into a cscl solution in a optiseal polyallomer tube beckman coulter palo alto usa the buoyant density bd of each tube was adjusted to 1 714 g ml the mixtures were centrifuged at 57 000 rpm for 48 h at 20 using an optima max tl ultracentrifuge beckman coulter palo alto usa after ultracentrifugation dnas were immediately fractionated into 24 gradient fractions approximately 200 μl per fraction the calculation of bd value and precipitation of cscl gradient fractions was described in previous study sun

controls in each run to detect possible dna contamination 2 5 illumina miseq sequencing of 16s rrna genes representative dna samples with a high abundance of 16s rrna genes in heavy and light fractions of each treatment were selected for 16s rrna amplicon sequencing a total of twenty representative dna fractions from treatments 12cv 13cv and 13control at days 8 and 16 were sequenced for the v4 hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene with the primer set 515f 806r klindworth et al 2013 the amplicon sequencing was performed on an illumina miseq platform personalbio shanghai china the average sequencing depth of each library was 137 551 reads paired end reads were analyzed with the qiime2 202 002 toolkit bolyen et al 2019 the filtered reads were then clustered into amplicon sequence variants asv with dada2 callahan et al 2016 which were further assigned against the silva 132 database quast et al 2012 2 6 shotgun metagenomic sequencing and analysis given that the amount of dna in the single heavy fraction of 13cv was insufficient for shotgun metagenomic sequencing representative heavy fractions i e fraction with high 16s rrna gene abundance from triplicate cultures of the day 16 13cv treatment were pooled into one composite dna sample shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed to this composite dna sample on an illumina hiseq 4000 platform personalbio shanghai china a total of 73 536 654 reads were obtained and were trimmed using trimmomatic 0 39 bolger et al 2014 with the following settings sliding window 4 15 leading 3 trailing 3 minilen 80 overlapping read pairs were identified and merged using flash magoc and salzberg 2011 with a minimum overlap of 15 bp and a maximum overlap of 100 bp the clean datasets were de novo assembled into contigs using megahit li et al 2015 k 21 141 step 10 metagenome assembled genomes mags were retrieved from assembled contigs via metagenome binning using a combination of maxbin2 wu et al 2016 metabat2 kang et al 2015 and concoct alneberg et al 2014 the mags were then refined and resembled to improve their quality by the das tool sieber et al 2018 subsequently checkm parks et al 2015 was used to assess the completeness and contamination of mags only mags with a completeness of 60 and contamination of 15 were selected for downstream analysis the taxonomy and functional genes of the mags were annotated using gtdb tk chaumeil et al 2019 and eggnog huerta cepas et al 2019 respectively phylogeny of mags and their reference genomes were further analyzed in mega tamura et al 2021 2 7 accession numbers the raw 16s rrna gene amplicon and metagenome sequences have been deposited in ncbi under project number prjna844891 3 results 3 1 v v reduction in cultures inoculated from v contaminated sediment geochemical parameters of the contaminated river sediment are listed in table s1 briefly the sediment had a v concentration of 430 mg kg which is about 5 times higher than the background v concentrations in soils of china v v reducing cultures were set up using the contaminated sediment as inoculum v v was supplemented as the sole electron acceptor with acetic acid as the sole carbon source a decrease in v v was observed in treatments amended with v v and acetate fig 1 approximately 40 mg l v v was depleted in 8 days in contrast no decrease of v v was observed in sterile controls or in control treatments without addition of acetic acid no acetic acid control based on the changes of v v concentration and geochemical properties of vanadium v v was reduced in treatments amended with v v and acetate in addition v v reduction was mediated by microorganisms with acetate as the likely electron donor concentrations of 13ch4 in 13cv and 13control treatments were measured fig s1 accordingly more 13ch4 was produced in 13cv than that in 13control in addition mcra which encodes a key enzyme in methane formation pereyra et al 2010 was quantified in this study as a biomarker to demonstrate the abundances of methanogens fig s2 more mcra was also observed in treatment amended by v v and acetate than that in control treatment 3 2 microorganisms responsible for v v reduction identified by dna sip dna sip was performed to identify the putative v v reducing microorganisms in the cultures the 16s rrna gene copy numbers were quantified in heavy and light fractions of genomic dna of the three treatments from three time points i e days 4 8 and 16 as shown in fig 2 the maximum relative abundance of 16s rrna gene copies was initially observed in the light fractions bd values of 1 71 g ml in all treatments at day 4 a small 16s rrna gene copy abundance peak gradually shifted to heavier dna fractions bd values of 1 73 g ml of day 8 and 1 74 g ml of day 16 only in the 13cv treatment in contrast no shift in the distribution of 16s rrna gene abundance across the cscl fractions was observed either in either 12cv or 13control notably no gene abundance shift over buoyant density was observed in the 13control suggested that only v v reducers were gradually labeled by 13c acetate fractions with the highest relative abundance of 16s rrna genes and the heavy fractions showing a small increase bd values range from 1 73 to 1 74 g ml in the 13cv treatment were sequenced to identify putative v v reducing microorganisms in addition fractions with the highest relative 16s rrna gene abundance from the 12cv and 13control treatments were also selected for amplicon sequencing details of fractions selected for amplicon sequencing are shown in fig 2 and table s2 the most abundant microbial taxa are summarized in fig 3 microorganisms showing enrichment in the heavy dna fractions of the 13cv treatment are assumed to have the ability to oxidize and assimilate acetate and thus incorporated 13c acetate into their dna however since acetate might be assimilated by a wide variety of anaerobic bacteria such as as v and fe iii reducing bacteria lear et al 2007 hori et al 2010 comparison of 13c acetate assimilating phylotypes in 13cv to the 13control is necessary to deduce the bacteria specifically active in v v reduction microorganisms affiliated with methanosarcina anaeromyxobacter and geobacter exhibited high abundances in heavy fractions of the 13cv treatment and significantly higher than their abundances in the 13control treatment suggesting that they may be responsible for v v reduction in addition the highest archaea to bacteria ratio was observed in heavy fraction of 13cv at two time points compared to their counterparts in other fractions including heavy fractions of treatment only amended 13c acetate but not v fig s3 this result suggested that a substantial fraction of active microbial populations that incorporated 13c in the presence of v v was archaea implying that archaea may play an important role in v v reduction 3 3 metagenomic analysis of 13c heavy fractions metagenomic sequencing was conducted on a composite sample of the heavy fractions of 13cv and metagenomic binning was performed to investigate the metabolic potentials of the microbial community involved in v v reduction six mags including one archaeal mag and five bacterial mags with 60 completeness and 15 contamination were obtained the mags were phylogenetically classified into four classes methanosarcina myxococcia desulfuromonadia and desulfarculia fig 4 notably mags associated with two putative v v reducing bacteria inferred based on the differences in their abundances in 13cv and 13control treatments fig 2 i e anaeromyxobacter sp bin 14 and geobacter sp bin 8 and bin 23 and one putative v v reducing archaeon i e methanosarcina sp bin 6 were selected for further analysis two nitrate reductase genes i e narg and napa implicated in v v reduction in previous studies he et al 2021 sun et al 2020 were detected in the anaeromyxobacter and geobacter mags but not in the methanosarcina mag fig 5 in addition the anaeromyxobacter mag contained genes involved in nitrate reduction nari nird and nrfa and dmso reductase families psra fdhn dmsa and phsa while the methanosarcina mag only contained two genes sat and cysh putative multi heme c type cytochrome mhc involved in electron shuttling and dissimilatory metal reduction were investigated mehta et al 2005 jing et al 2020 a total of six genes encoding mhc cyma mtra mtrc omca omce and omcs directly involved in the reduction of fe iii mn iv oxides were selected according to previous study shi et al 2007 among the three putative v v reducing microorganisms mag affiliated with anaeromyxobacter contained all genes including cyma mtra mtrc and omca for electron transfer pathways of shewanella oneidensis mr 1 while one mag associated with geobacter bin23 contained omce and omcs two essential genes for electron transfer pathways of geobacter sulfurreducens genes involved in methanogenesis mer fwdb hdrb mtra mtrb and mtba and reverse methanogenesis mcr mtr mer mtd mch ftr and fwd cai et al 2018 were detected in the methanosarcina mag genes involved in three putative pathways to reduce metals coupled with anaerobic oxidation of methane aom were also detected in the methanosarcina associated mag i the membrane bound heterodisulfide reductase hdrde that transfers electron to aqds 9 10 anthraquinone 2 6 disulfonate and could function as electron donor to reduce metals such as fe iii and mn iv ii f420h2 dehydrogenases fpo that transfers electrons to metals and iii multi heme c type cytochrome mhc that provide electrons to metals directly yan et al 2018 leu et al 2020 details of the detected genes are listed in table s3 4 discussion v contamination by mining activities has become a severe environmental problem posing health problems to exposed populations v v reduction mediated by microorganisms reduces the toxicity and mobility of v which therefore holds potentials for attenuating v contamination wang et al 2017 compared to our understanding of microbially mediated cycling of several other metals and metalloids such as fe and as biotic v cycling is less understood it has been reported that v v can be reduced by both bacteria and archaea and genetic mechanisms of v v reduction by bacteria have been implicated he et al 2021 shi et al 2020 however the genetic mechanisms for v reduction by archaea is still unknown in this study bacteria associated with geobacter and anaeromyxobacter and archaea associated with methanosarcina were identified as putative v v reducing microorganisms and their genomic potentials were predicted by metagenomic binning 4 1 potential v v reducing microorganisms in this study v v loss was only seen in the cultures amended with both v v and acetate while no v v loss was seen in the sterile controls with acetate suggesting that v v reduction was mediated by microorganisms utilizing acetate as a carbon source dna sip identified geobacter and anaeromyxobacter spp as putative v v reducing bacteria notably the archaeon methanosarcina is implicated as a putative v v reducing organism as well among these putative v v reducing microorganisms geobacter spp have been previously shown to reduce v v for example geobacter metallireducens reduces v v using acetate as an electron donor ortiz bernad et al 2004 while anaeromyxobacter has not been directly associated with v v reduction before members of anaeromyxobacter are known for their metabolic diversity to reduce various metal loid s such as fe iii wang et al 2019a u vi wu et al 2006 as v kudo et al 2013 and se vi he and yao 2010 their versatile metal reducing capabilities imply that anaeromyxobacter spp may also hold the capability to reduce v v methanosarcina was proposed as the putative v v reducing microorganisms because its relative abundances in heavy fractions of treatment amended by 13c acetate and v v were substantially higher than those in heavy fractions of control treatment amended by 13c acetate only suggesting that the amendment of v v facilitated the incorporation of 13c by methanosarcina fig 3b although v v reduction by methanogens is less documented methanosarcina spp have been reported to reduce v v to v iv for example methanosarcina mazei can reduce v v to v iv under mesophilic conditions zhang et al 2014 in another study methanosarcina was proposed to reduce v v using methane as electron donor wang et al 2019b in addition to v v methanosarcina spp are also capable of reducing other metal loid s for example methanosarcina could mediate u vi reduction during acetate promoted groundwater bioremediation holmes et al 2018 additionally members of methanosarcina were proposed to couple anaerobic methane oxidation with the reduction of cr vi and sb v in various membrane biofilm reactors lai et al 2018b lu et al 2016 4 2 metabolic potentials of putative v v reducing bacteria although a number of microorganisms could reduce v v the mechanisms for v v reduction have not been well documented yet especially for methanogens such as methanosarcina therefore metagenomic binning was performed to infer the putative genetic pathways of the putative v v reducing bacteria and archaea mags associated with the putative v v reducing microorganisms including methanosarcina geobacter and anaeromyxobacter were retrieved and offered an opportunity to investigate their metabolic potentials different gene families presumably linked with v v reduction were selected to examine whether mags associated with putative v v reducing microorganisms contained these genes two genes encoding nitrate reductases i e dissimilatory nitrate reductase narg and nitrate reductase napa have been reported as the key genes responsible for v v reduction in previous studies for example genes encoding molybdenum free dissimilatory nitrate reductase narg has been suggested to be responsible for v v reduction in v v reducing pseudomonas isachenkovii based on the result that the activity of purified nitrate reductase narg increased with v v reduction antipov et al 2000 further narg was detected in polaromonas spp mags a putative v v reducing bacterium providing additional line of evidence to support the role of narg in v v reduction sun et al 2020 in another study nitrate reductase gene napa was recognized as crucially functional gene in v v reduction he et al 2021 because the abundance of napa increased over the course of v v reduction in this study mags associated with two v v reducing bacteria i e geobacter and anaeromyxobacter contained both narg and napa genes suggesting that they may use either or both of these enzymes to reduce v v fig 6 a in addition to narg and napa mhc is reported to be responsible for v v reduction as reported previously he et al 2021 in this study different gene sets of mhc were detected in mags associated with geobacter and anaeromyxobacter indicating that they may use different pathways for mhc accordingly anaeromyxobacter may use electron transfer pathways of s oneidensis mr 1 in which cytochromes cyma and mtra can transfer electrons from the inner membrane through the periplasm to the outer membrane then the extracellular membrane proteins i e mtrc and omca receive electrons and directly reduce extracellular v v while geobacter may use electron transfer pathways of g sulfurreducens in which outer membrane proteins i e omce and omcs transfer electrons from intracellular to extracellular v v which serves as the electron acceptor fig 6a 4 3 metabolic potential for methanosarcina the putative v v reducing archaea in the current study a mag associated with methanosarcina was obtained offering an opportunity to explore the potential genetic pathway of methanosarcina for v v reduction unliked geobacter and anaeromyxobacter neither narg nor napa was detected in methanosarcina associated mag further the genes associated with dmso reductase family were selected to explore whether methanosarcina associated mag contained these genes consequently none of these dmso reductase genes was detected in methanosarcina associated mag given that neither napa narg nor dmso reductase genes were detected in methanosarcina associated mag it is suggested that methanosarcina may use different pathways to reduce v v than those utilized by their bacterial counterparts such as anaeromyxobacter and geobacter therefore it is hypothesized that members of methanosarcina are capable to reduce v v via anaerobic methane oxidation aom v because the similar pathways were employed to catalyze the reduction of several other metal loid s such as fe iii cr vi sb v and mn iv yan et al 2018 lai et al 2018b lu et al 2016 leu et al 2020 consistently significantly higher abundances of methanosarcina in heavy fractions of 13cv than those in 13control demonstrated that more methanosarcina incorporated 13c in addition significantly elevated methanogen abundances in treatment amended by acetate and v v compared to those in treatment amended by acetate only as indicated by mcra gene quantification fig s2 further suggested that the growth of methanosarcina might be favored in the presence of v v this may be caused by the elevated available energy production from aom v compared to that from methanogenesis indeed the gibbs free energy for methanosarcina to produce methane aceticlastically is 33 kj mol which is much less than those produced from aom v which is 641 66 kj mol please see supporting information for calculations therefore aom v is a more energy favorable process for methanosarcina which facilitated the growth and 13c incorporation by methanosarcina indeed higher concentrations of 13ch4 in 13cv than 13control indicated the addition of v v promote the methane production all these observations supported the aom v hypothesis that the amendment of v v induced aom v which promoted the growth of methanosarcina as well as facilitating the production of ch4 as discussed above archaea may reduce metal loid s via aom for example anaerobic methanotrophic archaea belonging to the family methanoperedenaceae formerly known as anme 2d were shown to be capable of aom coupled to fe iii and mn iv reduction via reverse methanogenesis cai et al 2018 leu et al 2020 in addition to methanotrophs methanogens can perform aom coupled with metal reduction dang et al 2021 through the reverse methanogenesis pathway as well enzmann et al 2018 timmers et al 2017 it is suggested that reverse methanogenesis may be a prerequisite for metal reduction dependent aom by methanogens dang et al 2021 indeed essentials genes associated with reverse methanogenesis were detected in methanosarcina associated mag table s3 such observation indicated that methanosarcina spp may have the genetic potentials to oxidize methane produced by aceticlastic methanogenesis in the acetate fed v reducing cultures fig s1 while the genetic pathway for aom v by methanosarcina has not been well characterized a similar process aom coupled with fe iii reduction has been proposed and may shed light upon the v reduction by methanosarcina accordingly a total of three possible pathways may be performed by methanosarcina acetivorans to drive fe iii dependent aom i the membrane bound heterodisulfide reductase hdrde oxidizes hscom and hscob with transfer of electrons to fe iii mediated by anthraquione 2 6 disulfonate aqds hdrde coupled to aqds pathway ii the oxidation of f420h2 by the f420h2 dehydrogenases fpo of m acetivorans may facilitate reduction of fe iii f420h2 fe iii orase activity fpo pathway iii multi heme c type cytochrome mhc may be the direct electron donor to fe iii reduction mhc pathway yan et al 2018 in addition it is reported that ca methanoperedens use similar pathways to reduce mn iv suggesting that these pathways may be widely utilized by archaea to perform metal dependent aom leu et al 2020 in this study the genes related to hdrde fpo and mhc were detected in the methanosarcina mag fig 6b suggesting that methanosarcina may use these pathways to reduce v v coupled with aom accordingly it is proposed that electrons generated from hdrde oxidation act as the electron donor for v v reduction fpo may facilitate the reduction of mp to mph2 which is then employed as electron donor to drive v v reduction finally electrons generated from methane oxidation are likely transferred into v v through mhc it is notable that all the predictions or even guess of the genetic mechanisms of methanosarcina spp are based on the presence of associated genes and previous literatures on similar processes wang et al 2019b further attempt to isolate methanosarcina or obtain a simplified v v reducing cultures containing methanosarcina is required to confirm the proposed v v reduction coupled with methane oxidation performed by methanosarcina 5 conclusion in this study biotic v v reduction in contaminated riverine ecosystems was explored with following major conclusions v v was reduced from 50 mg l to 0 mg l in cultures inoculated from v contaminated river sediments geobacter and anaeromyxobacter spp were identified as putative v v reducing bacteria by dna sip metagenomic binning indicated that they may use known functional genes for respiratory v v reduction i e narg and napa archaea associated with methanosarcina were identified as a potential v v reducing microorganism as well but using a different pathway to reduce v v methanosarcina spp may perform v v dependent aom via hdrde fpo and mhc pathways to reduce v v the potential of v v reduction by methanogens has important environmental implications methanogens can persist in organic rich environments without external inputs of electron acceptors because they can conserve energy either from acetate dismutation or from the reduction of co2 if methanogens were capable of v v reduction then this would make long term in situ bioremediation of v v a more attractive practice

15369,vanadium v is a transitional metal that poses health risks to exposed humans microorganisms play an important role in remediating v contamination by reducing more toxic and mobile vanadate v v to less toxic and mobile v iv in this study dna stable isotope probing sip coupled with metagenomic binning was used to identify microorganisms responsible for v v reduction and determine potential metabolic mechanisms in cultures inoculated with a v contaminated river sediment anaeromyxobacter and geobacter spp were identified as putative v v reducing bacteria while methanosarcina spp were identified as putative v v reducing archaea the bacteria may use the two nitrate reductases narg and napa for respiratory v v reduction as has been demonstrated previously for other species it is proposed that methanosarcina spp may reduce v v via anaerobic methane oxidation pathways aom v rather than via respiratory v v reduction performed by their bacterial counterparts as indicated by the presence of genes associated with anaerobic methane oxidation coupled with metal reduction in the metagenome assembled genome mag of methanosarcina briefly methane may be oxidized through the reverse methanogenesis pathway to produce electrons which may be further captured by v v to promote v v reduction more specially v v reduction by members of methanosarcina may be driven by electron transport coms scob heterodisulfide reductase hdrde f420h2 dehydrogenases fpo and multi heme c type cytochrome mhc the identification of putative v v reducing bacteria and archaea and the prediction of their

manucsript 1 introduction vanadium v is a transition metal with excellent catalytic ability and has been widely used in iron and steel industry pharmaceutical engineering ceramics aviation and nuclear technology zhang et al 2021a severe environmental contamination by v has been recorded with the increasing industrial applications for instance the concentration of v in soil around v smelting plants can reach over 5000 mg kg 65 times higher than the background level of v in chinese soils 82 mg kg wang et al 2020 vanadium concentrations as high as 0 77 mg l in groundwater were observed in rifle usa ortiz bernad et al 2004 vanadium naturally occurs in three oxidation states v v v vi and v iii huang et al 2015 v v is the most toxic and mobile form v iv by contrast is less toxic and usually exists as precipitates under neutral or alkaline conditions he et al 2021 yelton et al 2013 thus reduction of v v to v vi is a feasible way to alleviate v contamination compared to physical and chemical treatment v v reduction mediated by microorganisms is considered as a promising bioremediation strategy due to its potentially low cost and environment friendly nature zhang et al 2020a microorganisms play an important role in v v reduction in soils and water hao et al 2021 wang et al 2020 to date a limited number of v v reducing bacteria have been isolated including shewanella oneidensis carpentier et al 2003 shewanella loihica pv 4 wang et al 2017 geobacter metallireducens ortiz bernad et al 2004 and lactococcus raffinolactis zhang et al 2021a recently some v v reducing bacteria have been identified in complex microbial systems for example bacillus and thauera spp were suggested to reduce v v in v contaminated soil zhang et al 2019 methylomonas and denitratisoma were recognized as v v reducing bacteria in a membrane biofilm reactor using ch4 as the sole electron donor lai et al 2018a some studies have investigated the genes associated with v v reduction to clarify the mechanisms of v v reduction for instance sun et al reported that polaromonas spp encoded narg for v v reduction sun et al 2020 the nitrate reductase gene napa was reported as the key gene in autotrophic v v reduction he et al 2021 in addition to bacterial v v reducers archaea are also capable of v v reduction a mesophilic methanosarcina mazei and a thermophilic methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus were found to reduce v v to v iv using acetate and h2 as electron donors respectively zhang et al 2014 in another study methanosarcina were significantly enriched in a membrane biofilm batch reactor and was proposed to be responsible for v v reduction wang et al 2019b owing to the limitation of culture dependent techniques our understanding of v v reducing microorganisms especially for archaea which are more difficult to culture and isolate remains limited stable isotope probing sip can link members of microbial communities with their functions without isolation

has been used to identify microorganisms responsible for metal oid transformations such as as and sb cycling and fe iii and mn iv reduction hori et al 2010 sun et al 2022 vandieken et al 2012 xu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021b in addition the combination of dna sip and metagenomics has been used to uncover mechanisms for metal cycling sun et al 2022 for example the combination of dna sip metagenomic binning and pangenomics suggested that bacteria associated with geobacter and pseudomonas were active in sb v reduction and arra and anra were the key genes responsible for the process sun et al 2021 the combination of metagenomic binning may be able to reveal the microbial mechanisms for v v reduction therefore the present study aimed to identify v reducing microorganisms in a contaminated riverine ecosystem and predict their mechanisms of v reduction anaerobic cultures were established to estimate v v reduction using a long term v contaminated sediment as the inoculum dna sip was used to identify v reducing microorganisms in sediment cultures followed by metagenomic binning to evaluate their metabolic potential and predict the key genes and pathways for v v reduction 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and characterization a v contaminated sediment sample was collected at 0 10 cm depth from a river that passes through an active mine at lengshuijiang china 27 43 0 n

vista mpx varian for the geochemical properties of sediment the measurements followed protocols as previously described xu et al 2020 li et al 2022b 2 2 anaerobic incubation two sets of incubations were established one to characterize the activity of v v reduction designed as v v reduction activity incubation hereafter and another to identify the populations involved in v reduction by dna sip analysis designed as sip incubation hereafter 2 2 1 v reduction activity incubation for each culture bottle approximately 2 g of sediment was inoculated in a 120 ml sterilized serum bottle with 100 ml of mineral salts medium msm zhang et al 2015 the medium was then purged with n2 for 30 min and sealed with stopper and aluminum caps the gas in the headspace of bottle was replaced by purging with n2 co2 80 20 v v for a further 10 min the sediment slurries were preincubated at room temperature for 10 to 14 days to deplete indigenous electron donors i e organic matters and electron acceptors i e o2 fe iii and nitrate after the preincubation the supernatant was replaced with fresh msm and the headspace gas was purged with n2 for further incubation three different sets of treatments were established in triplicate for each of the treatment with the following amendments 1 50 mg l v v and 5 mm acetic acid 2 50 mg l v v only 3 and 5 mm acetic acid only autoclaved killed controls were also established with 50 mg l v v and 5 mm acetic acid addition all cultures were incubated statically at 30 during the incubation the reduction of v v was monitored every four days and the cultures were amended with 50 mg l v v and 5 mm acetic acid again after the complete removal of v v aqueous samples were collected and filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane the concentration of v v was measured using a spectrophotometric method carpentier et al 2003 2 2 2 sip incubation dna sip was performed to target putative v reducing microorganisms using 13c labeled acetic acid as carbon source the sip incubation was prepared by inoculating 2 g sediment into 100 ml of msm the cultures were then purged and sealed as described above the treatments for sip experiments were established as follow the

protocols sun and cupples 2012 zhang et al 2020b briefly approximately 2 μg of dna was provided into a cscl solution in a optiseal polyallomer tube beckman coulter palo alto usa the buoyant density bd of each tube was adjusted to 1 714 g ml the mixtures were centrifuged at 57 000 rpm for 48 h at 20 using an optima max tl ultracentrifuge beckman coulter palo alto usa after ultracentrifugation dnas were immediately fractionated into 24 gradient fractions approximately 200 μl per fraction the calculation of bd value and precipitation of cscl gradient fractions was described in previous study sun

controls in each run to detect possible dna contamination 2 5 illumina miseq sequencing of 16s rrna genes representative dna samples with a high abundance of 16s rrna genes in heavy and light fractions of each treatment were selected for 16s rrna amplicon sequencing a total of twenty representative dna fractions from treatments 12cv 13cv and 13control at days 8 and 16 were sequenced for the v4 hypervariable region of the 16s rrna gene with the primer set 515f 806r klindworth et al 2013 the amplicon sequencing was performed on an illumina miseq platform personalbio shanghai china the average sequencing depth of each library was 137 551 reads paired end reads were analyzed with the qiime2 202 002 toolkit bolyen et al 2019 the filtered reads were then clustered into amplicon sequence variants asv with dada2 callahan et al 2016 which were further assigned against the silva 132 database quast et al 2012 2 6 shotgun metagenomic sequencing and analysis given that the amount of dna in the single heavy fraction of 13cv was insufficient for shotgun metagenomic sequencing representative heavy fractions i e fraction with high 16s rrna gene abundance from triplicate cultures of the day 16 13cv treatment were pooled into one composite dna sample shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed to this composite dna sample on an illumina hiseq 4000 platform personalbio shanghai china a total of 73 536 654 reads were obtained and were trimmed using trimmomatic 0 39 bolger et al 2014 with the following settings sliding window 4 15 leading 3 trailing 3 minilen 80 overlapping read pairs were identified and merged using flash magoc and salzberg 2011 with a minimum overlap of 15 bp and a maximum overlap of 100 bp the clean datasets were de novo assembled into contigs using megahit li et al 2015 k 21 141 step 10 metagenome assembled genomes mags were retrieved from assembled contigs via metagenome binning using a combination of maxbin2 wu et al 2016 metabat2 kang et al 2015 and concoct alneberg et al 2014 the mags were then refined and resembled to improve their quality by the das tool sieber et al 2018 subsequently checkm parks et al 2015 was used to assess the completeness and contamination of mags only mags with a completeness of 60 and contamination of 15 were selected for downstream analysis the taxonomy and functional genes of the mags were annotated using gtdb tk chaumeil et al 2019 and eggnog huerta cepas et al 2019 respectively phylogeny of mags and their reference genomes were further analyzed in mega tamura et al 2021 2 7 accession numbers the raw 16s rrna gene amplicon and metagenome sequences have been deposited in ncbi under project number prjna844891 3 results 3 1 v v reduction in cultures inoculated from v contaminated sediment geochemical parameters of the contaminated river sediment are listed in table s1 briefly the sediment had a v concentration of 430 mg kg which is about 5 times higher than the background v concentrations in soils of china v v reducing cultures were set up using the contaminated sediment as inoculum v v was supplemented as the sole electron acceptor with acetic acid as the sole carbon source a decrease in v v was observed in treatments amended with v v and acetate fig 1 approximately 40 mg l v v was depleted in 8 days in contrast no decrease of v v was observed in sterile controls or in control treatments without addition of acetic acid no acetic acid control based on the changes of v v concentration and geochemical properties of vanadium v v was reduced in treatments amended with v v and acetate in addition v v reduction was mediated by microorganisms with acetate as the likely electron donor concentrations of 13ch4 in 13cv and 13control treatments were measured fig s1 accordingly more 13ch4 was produced in 13cv than that in 13control in addition mcra which encodes a key enzyme in methane formation pereyra et al 2010 was quantified in this study as a biomarker to demonstrate the abundances of methanogens fig s2 more mcra was also observed in treatment amended by v v and acetate than that in control treatment 3 2 microorganisms responsible for v v reduction identified by dna sip dna sip was performed to identify the putative v v reducing microorganisms in the cultures the 16s rrna gene copy numbers were quantified in heavy and light fractions of genomic dna of the three treatments from three time points i e days 4 8 and 16 as shown in fig 2 the maximum relative abundance of 16s rrna gene copies was initially observed in the light fractions bd values of 1 71 g ml in all treatments at day 4 a small 16s rrna gene copy abundance peak gradually shifted to heavier dna fractions bd values of 1 73 g ml of day 8 and 1 74 g ml of day 16 only in the 13cv treatment in contrast no shift in the distribution of 16s rrna gene abundance across the cscl fractions was observed either in either 12cv or 13control notably no gene abundance shift over buoyant density was observed in the 13control suggested that only v v reducers were gradually labeled by 13c acetate fractions with the highest relative abundance of 16s rrna genes and the heavy fractions showing a small increase bd values range from 1 73 to 1 74 g ml in the 13cv treatment were sequenced to identify putative v v reducing microorganisms in addition fractions with the highest relative 16s rrna gene abundance from the 12cv and 13control treatments were also selected for amplicon sequencing details of fractions selected for amplicon sequencing are shown in fig 2 and table s2 the most abundant microbial taxa are summarized in fig 3 microorganisms showing enrichment in the heavy dna fractions of the 13cv treatment are assumed to have the ability to oxidize and assimilate acetate and thus incorporated 13c acetate into their dna however since acetate might be assimilated by a wide variety of anaerobic bacteria such as as v and fe iii reducing bacteria lear et al 2007 hori et al 2010 comparison of 13c acetate assimilating phylotypes in 13cv to the 13control is necessary to deduce the bacteria specifically active in v v reduction microorganisms affiliated with methanosarcina anaeromyxobacter and geobacter exhibited high abundances in heavy fractions of the 13cv treatment and significantly higher than their abundances in the 13control treatment suggesting that they may be responsible for v v reduction in addition the highest archaea to bacteria ratio was observed in heavy fraction of 13cv at two time points compared to their counterparts in other fractions including heavy fractions of treatment only amended 13c acetate but not v fig s3 this result suggested that a substantial fraction of active microbial populations that incorporated 13c in the presence of v v was archaea implying that archaea may play an important role in v v reduction 3 3 metagenomic analysis of 13c heavy fractions metagenomic sequencing was conducted on a composite sample of the heavy fractions of 13cv and metagenomic binning was performed to investigate the metabolic potentials of the microbial community involved in v v reduction six mags including one archaeal mag and five bacterial mags with 60 completeness and 15 contamination were obtained the mags were phylogenetically classified into four classes methanosarcina myxococcia desulfuromonadia and desulfarculia fig 4 notably mags associated with two putative v v reducing bacteria inferred based on the differences in their abundances in 13cv and 13control treatments fig 2 i e anaeromyxobacter sp bin 14 and geobacter sp bin 8 and bin 23 and one putative v v reducing archaeon i e methanosarcina sp bin 6 were selected for further analysis two nitrate reductase genes i e narg and napa implicated in v v reduction in previous studies he et al 2021 sun et al 2020 were detected in the anaeromyxobacter and geobacter mags but not in the methanosarcina mag fig 5 in addition the anaeromyxobacter mag contained genes involved in nitrate reduction nari nird and nrfa and dmso reductase families psra fdhn dmsa and phsa while the methanosarcina mag only contained two genes sat and cysh putative multi heme c type cytochrome mhc involved in electron shuttling and dissimilatory metal reduction were investigated mehta et al 2005 jing et al 2020 a total of six genes encoding mhc cyma mtra mtrc omca omce and omcs directly involved in the reduction of fe iii mn iv oxides were selected according to previous study shi et al 2007 among the three putative v v reducing microorganisms mag affiliated with anaeromyxobacter contained all genes including cyma mtra mtrc and omca for electron transfer pathways of shewanella oneidensis mr 1 while one mag associated with geobacter bin23 contained omce and omcs two essential genes for electron transfer pathways of geobacter sulfurreducens genes involved in methanogenesis mer fwdb hdrb mtra mtrb and mtba and reverse methanogenesis mcr mtr mer mtd mch ftr and fwd cai et al 2018 were detected in the methanosarcina mag genes involved in three putative pathways to reduce metals coupled with anaerobic oxidation of methane aom were also detected in the methanosarcina associated mag i the membrane bound heterodisulfide reductase hdrde that transfers electron to aqds 9 10 anthraquinone 2 6 disulfonate and could function as electron donor to reduce metals such as fe iii and mn iv ii f420h2 dehydrogenases fpo that transfers electrons to metals and iii multi heme c type cytochrome mhc that provide electrons to metals directly yan et al 2018 leu et al 2020 details of the detected genes are listed in table s3 4 discussion v contamination by mining activities has become a severe environmental problem posing health problems to exposed populations v v reduction mediated by microorganisms reduces the toxicity and mobility of v which therefore holds potentials for attenuating v contamination wang et al 2017 compared to our understanding of microbially mediated cycling of several other metals and metalloids such as fe and as biotic v cycling is less understood it has been reported that v v can be reduced by both bacteria and archaea and genetic mechanisms of v v reduction by bacteria have been implicated he et al 2021 shi et al 2020 however the genetic mechanisms for v reduction by archaea is still unknown in this study bacteria associated with geobacter and anaeromyxobacter and archaea associated with methanosarcina were identified as putative v v reducing microorganisms and their genomic potentials were predicted by metagenomic binning 4 1 potential v v reducing microorganisms in this study v v loss was only seen in the cultures amended with both v v and acetate while no v v loss was seen in the sterile controls with acetate suggesting that v v reduction was mediated by microorganisms utilizing acetate as a carbon source dna sip identified geobacter and anaeromyxobacter spp as putative v v reducing bacteria notably the archaeon methanosarcina is implicated as a putative v v reducing organism as well among these putative v v reducing microorganisms geobacter spp have been previously shown to reduce v v for example geobacter metallireducens reduces v v using acetate as an electron donor ortiz bernad et al 2004 while anaeromyxobacter has not been directly associated with v v reduction before members of anaeromyxobacter are known for their metabolic diversity to reduce various metal loid s such as fe iii wang et al 2019a u vi wu et al 2006 as v kudo et al 2013 and se vi he and yao 2010 their versatile metal reducing capabilities imply that anaeromyxobacter spp may also hold the capability to reduce v v methanosarcina was proposed as the putative v v reducing microorganisms because its relative abundances in heavy fractions of treatment amended by 13c acetate and v v were substantially higher than those in heavy fractions of control treatment amended by 13c acetate only suggesting that the amendment of v v facilitated the incorporation of 13c by methanosarcina fig 3b although v v reduction by methanogens is less documented methanosarcina spp have been reported to reduce v v to v iv for example methanosarcina mazei can reduce v v to v iv under mesophilic conditions zhang et al 2014 in another study methanosarcina was proposed to reduce v v using methane as electron donor wang et al 2019b in addition to v v methanosarcina spp are also capable of reducing other metal loid s for example methanosarcina could mediate u vi reduction during acetate promoted groundwater bioremediation holmes et al 2018 additionally members of methanosarcina were proposed to couple anaerobic methane oxidation with the reduction of cr vi and sb v in various membrane biofilm reactors lai et al 2018b lu et al 2016 4 2 metabolic potentials of putative v v reducing bacteria although a number of microorganisms could reduce v v the mechanisms for v v reduction have not been well documented yet especially for methanogens such as methanosarcina therefore metagenomic binning was performed to infer the putative genetic pathways of the putative v v reducing bacteria and archaea mags associated with the putative v v reducing microorganisms including methanosarcina geobacter and anaeromyxobacter were retrieved and offered an opportunity to investigate their metabolic potentials different gene families presumably linked with v v reduction were selected to examine whether mags associated with putative v v reducing microorganisms contained these genes two genes encoding nitrate reductases i e dissimilatory nitrate reductase narg and nitrate reductase napa have been reported as the key genes responsible for v v reduction in previous studies for example genes encoding molybdenum free dissimilatory nitrate reductase narg has been suggested to be responsible for v v reduction in v v reducing pseudomonas isachenkovii based on the result that the activity of purified nitrate reductase narg increased with v v reduction antipov et al 2000 further narg was detected in polaromonas spp mags a putative v v reducing bacterium providing additional line of evidence to support the role of narg in v v reduction sun et al 2020 in another study nitrate reductase gene napa was recognized as crucially functional gene in v v reduction he et al 2021 because the abundance of napa increased over the course of v v reduction in this study mags associated with two v v reducing bacteria i e geobacter and anaeromyxobacter contained both narg and napa genes suggesting that they may use either or both of these enzymes to reduce v v fig 6 a in addition to narg and napa mhc is reported to be responsible for v v reduction as reported previously he et al 2021 in this study different gene sets of mhc were detected in mags associated with geobacter and anaeromyxobacter indicating that they may use different pathways for mhc accordingly anaeromyxobacter may use electron transfer pathways of s oneidensis mr 1 in which cytochromes cyma and mtra can transfer electrons from the inner membrane through the periplasm to the outer membrane then the extracellular membrane proteins i e mtrc and omca receive electrons and directly reduce extracellular v v while geobacter may use electron transfer pathways of g sulfurreducens in which outer membrane proteins i e omce and omcs transfer electrons from intracellular to extracellular v v which serves as the electron acceptor fig 6a 4 3 metabolic potential for methanosarcina the putative v v reducing archaea in the current study a mag associated with methanosarcina was obtained offering an opportunity to explore the potential genetic pathway of methanosarcina for v v reduction unliked geobacter and anaeromyxobacter neither narg nor napa was detected in methanosarcina associated mag further the genes associated with dmso reductase family were selected to explore whether methanosarcina associated mag contained these genes consequently none of these dmso reductase genes was detected in methanosarcina associated mag given that neither napa narg nor dmso reductase genes were detected in methanosarcina associated mag it is suggested that methanosarcina may use different pathways to reduce v v than those utilized by their bacterial counterparts such as anaeromyxobacter and geobacter therefore it is hypothesized that members of methanosarcina are capable to reduce v v via anaerobic methane oxidation aom v because the similar pathways were employed to catalyze the reduction of several other metal loid s such as fe iii cr vi sb v and mn iv yan et al 2018 lai et al 2018b lu et al 2016 leu et al 2020 consistently significantly higher abundances of methanosarcina in heavy fractions of 13cv than those in 13control demonstrated that more methanosarcina incorporated 13c in addition significantly elevated methanogen abundances in treatment amended by acetate and v v compared to those in treatment amended by acetate only as indicated by mcra gene quantification fig s2 further suggested that the growth of methanosarcina might be favored in the presence of v v this may be caused by the elevated available energy production from aom v compared to that from methanogenesis indeed the gibbs free energy for methanosarcina to produce methane aceticlastically is 33 kj mol which is much less than those produced from aom v which is 641 66 kj mol please see supporting information for calculations therefore aom v is a more energy favorable process for methanosarcina which facilitated the growth and 13c incorporation by methanosarcina indeed higher concentrations of 13ch4 in 13cv than 13control indicated the addition of v v promote the methane production all these observations supported the aom v hypothesis that the amendment of v v induced aom v which promoted the growth of methanosarcina as well as facilitating the production of ch4 as discussed above archaea may reduce metal loid s via aom for example anaerobic methanotrophic archaea belonging to the family methanoperedenaceae formerly known as anme 2d were shown to be capable of aom coupled to fe iii and mn iv reduction via reverse methanogenesis cai et al 2018 leu et al 2020 in addition to methanotrophs methanogens can perform aom coupled with metal reduction dang et al 2021 through the reverse methanogenesis pathway as well enzmann et al 2018 timmers et al 2017 it is suggested that reverse methanogenesis may be a prerequisite for metal reduction dependent aom by methanogens dang et al 2021 indeed essentials genes associated with reverse methanogenesis were detected in methanosarcina associated mag table s3 such observation indicated that methanosarcina spp may have the genetic potentials to oxidize methane produced by aceticlastic methanogenesis in the acetate fed v reducing cultures fig s1 while the genetic pathway for aom v by methanosarcina has not been well characterized a similar process aom coupled with fe iii reduction has been proposed and may shed light upon the v reduction by methanosarcina accordingly a total of three possible pathways may be performed by methanosarcina acetivorans to drive fe iii dependent aom i the membrane bound heterodisulfide reductase hdrde oxidizes hscom and hscob with transfer of electrons to fe iii mediated by anthraquione 2 6 disulfonate aqds hdrde coupled to aqds pathway ii the oxidation of f420h2 by the f420h2 dehydrogenases fpo of m acetivorans may facilitate reduction of fe iii f420h2 fe iii orase activity fpo pathway iii multi heme c type cytochrome mhc may be the direct electron donor to fe iii reduction mhc pathway yan et al 2018 in addition it is reported that ca methanoperedens use similar pathways to reduce mn iv suggesting that these pathways may be widely utilized by archaea to perform metal dependent aom leu et al 2020 in this study the genes related to hdrde fpo and mhc were detected in the methanosarcina mag fig 6b suggesting that methanosarcina may use these pathways to reduce v v coupled with aom accordingly it is proposed that electrons generated from hdrde oxidation act as the electron donor for v v reduction fpo may facilitate the reduction of mp to mph2 which is then employed as electron donor to drive v v reduction finally electrons generated from methane oxidation are likely transferred into v v through mhc it is notable that all the predictions or even guess of the genetic mechanisms of methanosarcina spp are based on the presence of associated genes and previous literatures on similar processes wang et al 2019b further attempt to isolate methanosarcina or obtain a simplified v v reducing cultures containing methanosarcina is required to confirm the proposed v v reduction coupled with methane oxidation performed by methanosarcina 5 conclusion in this study biotic v v reduction in contaminated riverine ecosystems was explored with following major conclusions v v was reduced from 50 mg l to 0 mg l in cultures inoculated from v contaminated river sediments geobacter and anaeromyxobacter spp were identified as putative v v reducing bacteria by dna sip metagenomic binning indicated that they may use known functional genes for respiratory v v reduction i e narg and napa archaea associated with methanosarcina were identified as a potential v v reducing microorganism as well but using a different pathway to reduce v v methanosarcina spp may perform v v dependent aom via hdrde fpo and mhc pathways to reduce v v the potential of v v reduction by methanogens has important environmental implications methanogens can persist in organic rich environments without external inputs of electron acceptors because they can conserve energy either from acetate dismutation or from the reduction of co2 if methanogens were capable of v v reduction then this would make long term in situ bioremediation of v v a more attractive practice
