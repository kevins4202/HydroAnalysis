effects at low concentrations 1 mg l fluoride is of health benefit in that it can significantly prevent dental caries however when consumed continuously in higher concentrations 1 5 mg l fluoride can cause adverse effects such as dental and skeletal fluorosis mottling of teeth cancer infertility in women and brain damage corral capulin et al 2019 dhanasekaran et al 2017 the world health organization has set a guidance level of 1 5 mg l for fluoride in drinking water who 2003 several countries which include china canada india middle east asian countries and some african countries such as tanzania kimambo et al 2019 have documented evidence of high fluoride levels in groundwater dhanasekaran et al 2017 george et al 2010 in zimbabwe urban communities mainly rely on purified municipal water while those in rural areas rely on groundwater accessed from boreholes springs and artesian wells togarepi et al 2012 high fluoride levels ranging between 5 and 10 mg l have been reported in zimbabwe s two districts tobaiwa et al 1991 due to the health hazards associated with high fluoride levels many workers have reported on methods and technologies for defluoridation these include

technique has attracted significant attention due to its universal applicability limited maintenance cost ability to remove fluoride even at low concentrations and simplicity dhanasekaran et al 2017 whilst fluoride adsorption has been investigated in both batch and continuous flow systems the latter has increasingly attracted attention due to the simplicity of the operation procedures low cost amenability to scaling up from laboratory to versatile systems and greater utility of sorbent capacity nouri and ouederni 2013 as well as possibility of adsorbent regeneration for several sorption desorption cycles charumathi and das 2012 furthermore fixed bed columns make use of a concentration gradient that propels the adsorption process even at low concentration levels of pollutant ions leading to maximum utilisation of sorbent and better quality of treated water in similar studies an aquatic macrophyte water hyacinth has been reported to show fluoride removal potential manna et al 2015 whilst the metal oxides have received considerable attention tofika et al 2016 the current study therefore sought to investigate the fluoride removal potential of a composite consisting of metal oxides and water hyacinth by doping the hyacinth with hydrous oxides of aluminium iron and their mixture the defluoridation studies were carried out in batch and column systems to establish the effect of ph effect of initial fluoride concentration effect of flow rate and effect of bed depth batch equilibrium sorption data was modelled using the freundlich and langmuir isotherms whilst the continuous flow data was analysed using break through curves the effect of column regeneration on fluoride adsorption and effectiveness of desorption agents was investigated through repeated sorption desorption cycles 2 materials and methods 2 1 adsorbent preparation 2 1 1 sampling and treatment of water hyacinth sampling and treatment of water hyacinth was carried out as reported in our previous

water and the water hyacinth replaced by daughter plants reproduced during the period five grams of nh4no3 fertiliser was added in the pond to promote shoot development plants were harvested after 4 weeks and roots were separated and washed three times with running tap water and twice with deionised water they were then sun dried for 2 days before being oven dried at 65 c for 12 h dried samples

attained the biomass was then oven dried at 65 c for 24 h and the dried powder was stored in polythene bags until used 2 1 2 synthesis of hydrous aluminium oxide particles the method was based on a modification of the procedure used by sujana et al 2009 for the synthesis of hydrous aluminium oxide a solution of 1 0 m naoh was added drop wise to a solution of 0 1 m alcl3 prepared in 0 01 m hcl until ph 8 was obtained the contents were stirred for 30 min and the white precipitate formed was allowed to remain in contact with the supernatant liquid for 24 h the white precipitate was filtered and washed with distilled water until the ph of the filtrate was neutral before drying at 80 c in an air oven a similar procedure was carried out for the synthesis of hydrous iron oxide 2 1 3 preparation and characterization of wh hao wh hao hfo and wh hfo beads for the synthesis of wh hfo beads sodium alginate biopolymer powder 2 g was dissolved in 100 ml of de ionised water and then agitated at 300 rpm and 60 c for 20 min to produce a translucent and viscous solution fine particles of hydrous iron oxide 1 0 g prepared as described in section 2 1 2 were then added and the resulting mixture stirred for 2 h water hyacinth root powder weighing 2 g was then added and the resulting mixture agitated at 100 rpm for 1 h to produce a homogeneous mixture drop wise extrusion of the viscous solution through a funnel into a 0 1 m cacl2 2h2o cross linker solution in a beaker produced the doped and entrapped water hyacinth spherical beads the temperature of the beaker was maintained at 4 7 c by placing it in an ice bath the resulting beads were then hardened by placing them in 2 w v cacl2 aq solution for 12 h the beads were then washed with de ionised water with agitation in a 250 ml conical flask for 30 min discarding the solution and repeating the procedure four times the beads were then dried with paper towels to remove residual water and eventually left to dry at room temperature samples of wh hao and wh hao hfo beads were produced using the same procedure for the wh hao hfo adsorbent 1 0 g comprising of equal quantities of the hydrous metal oxides was used characterization of surface morphologies was carried out using an fei nova nano scanning electron microscopy sem 230 instrument fei company oregon us and images were acquired at magnification of 500 2000 and 10000 at university of cape town sa 2 2 stock fluoride solution fluoride stock solution of concentration 100 mg l was prepared by dissolving 0 221 g of anhydrous sodium fluoride in 1000 ml of de ionised water at room temperature the stock solution was then diluted to get the desired concentration of the test solution for column adsorption studies fresh dilutions were used for each study plasticware was used for handling fluoride solutions the plasticware was first washed with dilute nitric acid and then rinsed thoroughly with de ionised water prior to use 2 3 effect of initial fluoride concentration 2 3 1 batch adsorption system batch sorption experiments were carried out by adding fluoride solution at different initial concentrations 5 50 mg l to 0 05 g of adsorbent beads and agitating the mixture at 200 rpm for 3 h at room temperature the sorbent was separated from the solution by vacuum filtration using whatman 42 filter paper the filtrate was analysed for residual fluoride ion concentration using a thermo scientific orion ion selective electrode for fluoride thermo fisher scientific 2 3 2 continuous flow system fixed bed column adsorption studies were conducted in a glass column of diameter 1 2 cm and height 65 cm a known quantity of the hydrous metal oxide doped water hyacinth beads was packed in the column to desired bed height a known concentration of the fluoride solution was continuously pumped into the column at a desired volumetric rate by means of a peristaltic pump a down mode was chosen to minimise accumulation of organic matter at the bottom of the column the effluent samples were collected at pre determined time intervals and analysed for the remaining fluoride concentration using a fluoride ion selective electrode the effect of initial fluoride concentration on adsorption efficiency was investigated for wh hao beads at initial fluoride concentrations of 5 mg l and 10 mg l fixing other parameters at ph 5 2 and flow rate of 3 ml min 2 4 effect of ph on fluoride concentration the effect of solution ph was studied for the ph range 3 12 for the batch system with adjustments made using solutions of 0 1 m na2co3 or 0 1 m hcl the adsorbent dose agitation speed and contact time were kept constant 2 5 the effect of flow rate on fluoride sorption the influence of flow rate on the adsorption of fluoride ions by metal doped water hyacinth beads was investigated using the continuous flow system at flow rates of 2 ml min and 3 ml min constant bed depth 3 8 cm ph 5 2 and initial concentration fluoride concentration of 5 mg l 2 6 effect of bed depth on fluoride sorption the effect of bed depth on fluoride adsorption using hydrous metal oxide doped water hyacinth beads was investigated at bed depth of 3 8 cm and 7 2 cm at a constant flow rate of 3 ml min and at ph 5 2 the bed depths of 3 8 cm and 7 2 cm were obtained by packing of 2 g and 4 g of the adsorbent in the glass column respectively the experiment was carried out at 22 c and concentration of fluoride in effluent was determined using a fluoride ion selective electrode at specified time interval 2 7 effect of competing ions the effect of anions such as po4 3 so4 2 and hco3 on the adsorption of fluoride was studied using a batch sorption system by adding appropriate amounts of 200 mg l of the sodium salt solutions of the anions to 50 ml of 10 mg l of the fluoride solution at ph 5 adsorbent dose of 0 06 g and agitated at 100 rpm for 2 h 2 8 the effect of adsorbent regeneration on fluoride ion adsorption the exhausted column was drained off the aqueous solution by pumping in air the fluoride ions were then stripped off from the exhausted adsorbent by pumping 0 1 m naoh aq at a flow rate of 3 ml min the effluent fluoride samples were collected at periodic time intervals of 30 min for fluoride ion analysis the column was then thoroughly washed with distilled water to remove the sodium hydroxide solution the fluoride solution was then pumped in at a flow rate of 3 ml min for adsorption desorption cycles 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the adsorbent sem images of wh hao beads are shown in fig 1 at magnifications of 500 2000 and 10000 times the images show that the morphology of the surface was porous rough and heterogeneous with folding characteristics similar findings were reported by sapna et al 2018 who found that a biopolymer based adsorbent synthesized by entrapping trimetallic oxide in alginate exhibited rough porous and bumps over the surface 3 2 batch adsorption isotherms a number of models have been used to test equilibrium data fitting in adsorption studies and these include langmuir freundlich temkin redlich peterson flory huggins etc mahamadi and nharingo 2010 in this study the freundlich model was selected based on the sem images which indicated that the adsorbent had a heterogeneous rough physical surface thus suggesting that fluoride adsorption would occur beyond monolayer coverage however the langmuir isotherm which assumes homogenous surface and monolayer adsorption was still tested to further validate the surface characterization results the freundlich and langmuir models are expressed as equations 1 and 2 respectively 1 ln q 1 n ln c e ln k f 2 c e q e 1 q max c e q max where q is the equilibrium adsorption capacity k f and n are the freundlich constants characteristic of the system indicating the adsorption capacity and adsorption intensity respectively q max mg g is the maximum amount of metal ion per unit weight of adsorbent required to form a complete monolayer on the surface and b is the langmuir equilibrium adsorption constant which is related to the affinity of the binding sites freundlich and langmuir isotherm plots obtained using experimental equilibrium data are illustrated in fig 2 for wh hao hfo beads and the freundlich constants for the three types of adsorbents are shown in table 1 the high correlation coefficients for freundlich isotherms r2 0 99 shows that the model adequately described the adsorption equilibrium process furthermore all values of 1 n were greater than 1 indicating that sorption was favoured under the conditions investigated however the lower r2 value for the langmuir isotherm 0 86 suggests that the model did not adequately describe the adsorption data it can therefore be concluded that the uptake of fluoride by the adsorbents was not restricted to monolayer adsorption which is in agreement with the observed sem images the surface of the adsorbents were heterogeneous with folding patterns hence likely to result in varying extent and intensity of adsorption it can therefore be suggested that the adsorption capacities reported in this study e g 4 43 mg g for wh hao most likely underrepresented the actual capacity since they were determined using the langmuir isotherm however table 2 shows that the adsorption capacity recorded for wh hao was still higher than those reported for other adsorbents such as modified immobilized activated alumina miaa 0 76 mg g rafique et al 2013 polyaniline alumina pani alo composite 2 64 mg g karthikeyan et al 2009 and comparable to nanomagnesia alumina adsorbent prepared by doping γ al2o3 with mgo nanoparticle 5 60 mg g nazari and halladj 2014 3 3 effect of ph on fluoride adsorption the effect of ph on the fluoride ion uptake was investigated at an initial concentration of 5 mg l adsorbent dose of 1 0 g l volume of fluoride solution 50 ml and agitation speed of 100 rpm from the results shown in fig 3 the percentage fluoride uptake decreased with increase in the ph of solution this can be explained in terms of the ph dependence of mechanistic interactions between fluoride and hydrous metal oxides as described previously sujana et al 2009 3 moh h moh2 moh2 f mf h2o which can be combined to give 4 moh h f mf h2o as the ph increases the predominant mechanism becomes 5 moh f mf oh where m represents the metal ion moh represents the surface hydroxyl group and mf a surface occupied by a fluoride ion sujana et al 2009 from eq 4 it is clear that lowering the ph will lead to a higher rate of fluoride removal while eq 5 suggests that increased ph will shift the equilibrium towards free fluoride ion thereby reducing its removal from solution 3 4 column sorption studies 3 4 1 effect of fluoride concentration on the breakthrough curve the break through curve in fig 4 a shows that an increase in the concentration of fluoride resulted in a corresponding increase in the gradient of the break through curve and a proportionate decrease in the break through time for wh hao beads the break through time decreased from 105 to 75 min as the concentration was increased from 5 mg l to 10 mg l the decrease in break through time is attributed to the early saturation of the binding sites of hydrous al2o3 doped water hyacinth beads at higher fluoride inlet concentration at higher concentration there is a higher rate of transfer of the fluoride ions to the adsorbent surface due to increased diffusion coefficient caused by a greater concentration gradient nouri and ouederni 2013 early saturation of binding sites implies that the volume of influent fluoride solution treated before saturation of the adsorbent decreases with an increase in the fluoride concentrations 3 4 2 effect of flow rate the influent flow rate has a significant effect on the break through time and exhaustion time of the wh hao beads as shown in fig 4 b increasing the flow rate from 2 to 3 ml min caused exhaustion time to increase from 105 min to 165 min and breakthrough time to increase from 300 to 420 min this was attributed to less time spent by fluoride ions in the adsorption column at higher flow rate consequently at higher flow rates less time is available for the fluoride ions to interact with the adsorbent for adsorption to take place when the time of contact between the adsorbent and the fluoride ions is limited intra particle diffusion of the fluoride ions may not be significant and hence adsorption equilibrium is not established malkoc and nuhoglu 2006 taty costodes et al 2005 under such conditions the fluoride ions may elute out of the column with limited time for diffusion into the adsorbent leading to higher volumes of effluent collected with minimum reduction in fluoride concentration 3 4 3 effect of adsorbent bed depth the effect of adsorbent bed depth on the break through curve is depicted in fig 4 c the beak through curve is shown to be strongly influenced by the adsorbent depth it is evident from the graph that the slope of the break through curve decreases with an increase in bed depth the fall in the slope of the break through time is attributed to the increase in the contact time of the influent fluoride solution with the aluminium oxide doped water hyacinth beads as the bed height is increased dutta et al 2012 the break through time increased from 105 to 165 min as bed depth was increased from 3 8 to 7 3 cm it has already been mentioned earlier that the better fitting of sorption data to the freundlich isotherm compared to the langmuir one supported the sem images which showed presence of a heterogeneous rough physical surface at lower bed depth axial flow of the influent fluoride solution in the heterogeneous adsorbent is encouraged and this has the effect of limiting the residence time of the adsorbate in the column and also the time of diffusion of the fluoride ions into the pores of the adsorbent resulting in a reduction in the break through time this implies that keeping all other parameters constant increasing bed depth results in increasing the adsorption capacity of the column 3 5 effect of competing ions it was shown that the presence of so4 2 ions caused an insignificant reduction in the uptake of fluoride ions compared to the effect of hco3 and po4 3 ions fig 5 the reduction in the uptake of fluoride ions in the presence of hco3 ions can be attributed to the increase in ph on addition of this ion and the competition of the generated hydroxide ion with the fluoride ion for the active sites on the aluminium oxide doped alginate water hyacinth beads 3 6 adsorption desorption studies practical use of adsorbent material is significantly dependent on its ability to be regenerated and the adsorption potential of the regenerated adsorbent to assess reusability of the synthesized adsorbents batch desorption experiments were conducted for 0 1 g of the fluoride loaded wh hao beads with 0 1 m naoh solution the exhausted adsorbent was dipped in 50 ml of 0 1 m naoh solution placed in 150 ml pvc bottles the mixture was then agitated with a horizontal shaker at 200 rpm agitation rate for 2 h the wh hao beads were then separated from the solution by filtration using whatman 42 filter paper followed by determination of the fluoride ion concentration the adsorbent was then activated by dipping it in 0 1 m h2so4 and then washing with distilled water until a neutral ph resulted cyclic sorption and desorption experiments were carried out for five more cycles the results shown in table 3 indicate that the desorption was greater than 80 for all 5 sorption desorption cycles this indicates that the adsorbent can be repeatedly used for at least 5 times through regeneration using desorption agencies of the tested desorption agencies aqueous naoh showed relatively higher desorption capacity compared to aqueous nacl and hno3 aq these results can be attributed to the ability of hydroxide ions to effectively compete with fluoride ions on the binding sites of the adsorbent 4 conclusion in this study fluoride was effectively removed from aqueous solution using hydrous aluminium oxide wh hao hydrous iron oxide wh hfo and hydrous aluminium oxide iron oxide mixture wh hao hfo at low ph 3 the ability of the adsorbents to remove fluoride followed the order of doping agents as wh hao wh hao hfo wh hfo with maximum fluoride adsorption capacities in the range 4 18 4 43 mg g better fitting of sorption data to freundlich compared to the langmuir adsorption isotherm supported sem characterization which indicated that the adsorbent surface was rough and heterogeneous continuous flow studies showed that increasing fluoride influent concentration and flow rate as well using lower bed depth improved the efficiency of the adsorption column it was also shown that the wh hao beads could be effectively regenerated in 3 sorption desorption cycles with regenerated columns achieving at least 80 adsorption efficiency the hydrous metal oxide doped water hyacinth showed great potential for development as an alternative adsorbent for the removal of fluoride from water acknowledgement this work was supported through a

samples were collected at periodic time intervals of 30 min for fluoride ion analysis the column was then thoroughly washed with distilled water to remove the sodium hydroxide solution the fluoride solution was then pumped in at a flow rate of 3 ml min for adsorption desorption cycles 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the adsorbent sem images of wh hao beads are shown in fig 1 at magnifications of 500 2000 and 10000 times the images show that the morphology of the surface was porous rough and heterogeneous with folding characteristics similar findings were reported by sapna et al 2018 who found that a biopolymer based adsorbent synthesized by entrapping trimetallic oxide in alginate exhibited rough porous and bumps over the surface 3 2 batch adsorption isotherms a number of models have been used to test equilibrium data fitting in adsorption studies and these include langmuir freundlich temkin redlich peterson flory huggins etc mahamadi and nharingo 2010 in this study the freundlich model was selected based on the sem images which indicated that the adsorbent had a heterogeneous rough physical surface thus suggesting that fluoride adsorption would occur beyond monolayer coverage however the langmuir isotherm which assumes homogenous surface and monolayer adsorption was still tested to further validate the surface characterization results the freundlich and langmuir models are expressed as equations 1 and 2 respectively 1 ln q 1 n ln c e ln k f 2 c e q e 1 q max c e q max where q is the equilibrium adsorption capacity k f and n are the freundlich constants characteristic of the system indicating the adsorption capacity and adsorption intensity respectively q max mg g is the maximum amount of metal ion per unit weight of adsorbent required to form a complete monolayer on the surface and b is the langmuir equilibrium adsorption constant which is related to the affinity of the binding sites freundlich and langmuir isotherm plots obtained using experimental equilibrium data are illustrated in fig 2 for wh hao hfo beads and the freundlich constants for the three types of adsorbents are shown in table 1 the high correlation coefficients for freundlich isotherms r2 0 99 shows that the model adequately described the adsorption equilibrium process furthermore all values of 1 n were greater than 1 indicating that sorption was favoured under the conditions investigated however the lower r2 value for the langmuir isotherm 0 86 suggests that the model did not adequately describe the adsorption data it can therefore be concluded that the uptake of fluoride by the adsorbents was not restricted to monolayer adsorption which is in agreement with the observed sem images the surface of the adsorbents were heterogeneous with folding patterns hence likely to result in varying extent and intensity of adsorption it can therefore be suggested that the adsorption capacities reported in this study e g 4 43 mg g for wh hao most likely underrepresented the actual capacity since they were determined using the langmuir isotherm however table 2 shows that the adsorption capacity recorded for wh hao was still higher than those reported for other adsorbents such as modified immobilized activated alumina miaa 0 76 mg g rafique et al 2013 polyaniline alumina pani alo composite 2 64 mg g karthikeyan et al 2009 and comparable to nanomagnesia alumina adsorbent prepared by doping γ al2o3 with mgo nanoparticle 5 60 mg g nazari and halladj 2014 3 3 effect of ph on fluoride adsorption the effect of ph on the fluoride ion uptake was investigated at an initial concentration of 5 mg l adsorbent dose of 1 0 g l volume of fluoride solution 50 ml and agitation speed of 100 rpm from the results shown in fig 3 the percentage fluoride uptake decreased with increase in the ph of solution this can be explained in terms of the ph dependence of mechanistic interactions between fluoride and hydrous metal oxides as described previously sujana et al 2009 3 moh h moh2 moh2 f mf h2o which can be combined to give 4 moh h f mf h2o as the ph increases the predominant mechanism becomes 5 moh f mf oh where m represents the metal ion moh represents the surface hydroxyl group and mf a surface occupied by a fluoride ion sujana et al 2009 from eq 4 it is clear that lowering the ph will lead to a higher rate of fluoride removal while eq 5 suggests that increased ph will shift the equilibrium towards free fluoride ion thereby reducing its removal from solution 3 4 column sorption studies 3 4 1 effect of fluoride concentration on the breakthrough curve the break through curve in fig 4 a shows that an increase in the concentration of fluoride resulted in a corresponding increase in the gradient of the break through curve and a proportionate decrease in the break through time for wh hao beads the break through time decreased from 105 to 75 min as the concentration was increased from 5 mg l to 10 mg l the decrease in break through time is attributed to the early saturation of the binding sites of hydrous al2o3 doped water hyacinth beads at higher fluoride inlet concentration at higher concentration there is a higher rate of transfer of the fluoride ions to the adsorbent surface due to increased diffusion coefficient caused by a greater concentration gradient nouri and ouederni 2013 early saturation of binding sites implies that the volume of influent fluoride solution treated before saturation of the adsorbent decreases with an increase in the fluoride concentrations 3 4 2 effect of flow rate the influent flow rate has a significant effect on the break through time and exhaustion time of the wh hao beads as shown in fig 4 b increasing the flow rate from 2 to 3 ml min caused exhaustion time to increase from 105 min to 165 min and breakthrough time to increase from 300 to 420 min this was attributed to less time spent by fluoride ions in the adsorption column at higher flow rate consequently at higher flow rates less time is available for the fluoride ions to interact with the adsorbent for adsorption to take place when the time of contact between the adsorbent and the fluoride ions is limited intra particle diffusion of the fluoride ions may not be significant and hence adsorption equilibrium is not established malkoc and nuhoglu 2006 taty costodes et al 2005 under such conditions the fluoride ions may elute out of the column with limited time for diffusion into the adsorbent leading to higher volumes of effluent collected with minimum reduction in fluoride concentration 3 4 3 effect of adsorbent bed depth the effect of adsorbent bed depth on the break through curve is depicted in fig 4 c the beak through curve is shown to be strongly influenced by the adsorbent depth it is evident from the graph that the slope of the break through curve decreases with an increase in bed depth the fall in the slope of the break through time is attributed to the increase in the contact time of the influent fluoride solution with the aluminium oxide doped water hyacinth beads as the bed height is increased dutta et al 2012 the break through time increased from 105 to 165 min as bed depth was increased from 3 8 to 7 3 cm it has already been mentioned earlier that the better fitting of sorption data to the freundlich isotherm compared to the langmuir one supported the sem images which showed presence of a heterogeneous rough physical surface at lower bed depth axial flow of the influent fluoride solution in the heterogeneous adsorbent is encouraged and this has the effect of limiting the residence time of the adsorbate in the column and also the time of diffusion of the fluoride ions into the pores of the adsorbent resulting in a reduction in the break through time this implies that keeping all other parameters constant increasing bed depth results in increasing the adsorption capacity of the column 3 5 effect of competing ions it was shown that the presence of so4 2 ions caused an insignificant reduction in the uptake of fluoride ions compared to the effect of hco3 and po4 3 ions fig 5 the reduction in the uptake of fluoride ions in the presence of hco3 ions can be attributed to the increase in ph on addition of this ion and the competition of the generated hydroxide ion with the fluoride ion for the active sites on the aluminium oxide doped alginate water hyacinth beads 3 6 adsorption desorption studies practical use of adsorbent material is significantly dependent on its ability to be regenerated and the adsorption potential of the regenerated adsorbent to assess reusability of the synthesized adsorbents batch desorption experiments were conducted for 0 1 g of the fluoride loaded wh hao beads with 0 1 m naoh solution the exhausted adsorbent was dipped in 50 ml of 0 1 m naoh solution placed in 150 ml pvc bottles the mixture was then agitated with a horizontal shaker at 200 rpm agitation rate for 2 h the wh hao beads were then separated from the solution by filtration using whatman 42 filter paper followed by determination of the fluoride ion concentration the adsorbent was then activated by dipping it in 0 1 m h2so4 and then washing with distilled water until a neutral ph resulted cyclic sorption and desorption experiments were carried out for five more cycles the results shown in table 3 indicate that the desorption was greater than 80 for all 5 sorption desorption cycles this indicates that the adsorbent can be repeatedly used for at least 5 times through regeneration using desorption agencies of the tested desorption agencies aqueous naoh showed relatively higher desorption capacity compared to aqueous nacl and hno3 aq these results can be attributed to the ability of hydroxide ions to effectively compete with fluoride ions on the binding sites of the adsorbent 4 conclusion in this study fluoride was effectively removed from aqueous solution using hydrous aluminium oxide wh hao hydrous iron oxide wh hfo and hydrous aluminium oxide iron oxide mixture wh hao hfo at low ph 3 the ability of the adsorbents to remove fluoride followed the order of doping agents as wh hao wh hao hfo wh hfo with maximum fluoride adsorption capacities in the range 4 18 4 43 mg g better fitting of sorption data to freundlich compared to the langmuir adsorption isotherm supported sem characterization which indicated that the adsorbent surface was rough and heterogeneous continuous flow studies showed that increasing fluoride influent concentration and flow rate as well using lower bed depth improved the efficiency of the adsorption column it was also shown that the wh hao beads could be effectively regenerated in 3 sorption desorption cycles with regenerated columns achieving at least 80 adsorption efficiency the hydrous metal oxide doped water hyacinth showed great potential for development as an alternative adsorbent for the removal of fluoride from water acknowledgement this work was supported through a

12186,the main objectives of the study are i to assess the possibility of synthesizing ferrous sulfide fes in situ within the natural sand packed porous media ii to evaluate the extent of arsenite as iii immobilization in the fes containing natural porous media and iii to evaluate the fate of iron fe during immobilization of as iii and its implication on the porosity several column experiments are performed where ferrous sulfate feso4 and sodium sulfide na2s solution are injected alternatively in the porous media for synthesis of fes with without porous media being pre saturated with as iii then as iii solution is injected from one end the results indicate that fes can be effectively synthesized throughout the column the immobilization of as iii is also very high 80 up to 17 pvs in those cases with as iii pre saturated condition the injection of 20 mm reagents for 1 5 pvs shows the optimal result for immobilization of as iii 72 retained up to 35 pvs in this case though the relatively high amount of fe has mobilized along with as iii at the initial stage however towards the later stage no fe is detected at the outlet and almost 60 of injected fe is retained within the porous media graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic ferrous sulfide fate and transport in situ remediation natural sediment 1 introduction arsenic as contamination in groundwater has become a major problem in many parts of the world the occurrences of as in the alluvial aquifers in the eastern part of india and several districts of bangladesh are reported extensively in the literature bhattacharya et al 1997 2004 ahmed et al 2004 vega et al 2017 groundwater contamination by as in bangladesh is recognized as the largest poisoning of the population in human history smith et al 2000 the population at several locations in the different provinces of china and latin america are also exposed to as contamination natural occurrences of as in the groundwater are identified at few locations in the united states and canada smedley and kinniburgh 2002 bundschuh et al 2012 maity et al 2017 litter et al 2019 several recent studies have explored the potential of different metal oxide based nanoparticles such as iron oxides nfexoy zero valent iron nzvi alumina nal2o3 titanium dioxide ntio2 zirconium dioxide nzro2 nickel oxide nnio magnesium oxide nmgo etc for removal of as from water jadhav et al 2015 lata and samadder 2016 adlnasab et al 2019 deng et al 2019 hosseini et al 2018 de et al 2019 arabnezhad et al 2017 raychoudhury et al 2015 yang et al 2018 arsenic removal by the iron based adsorbent is the most widely used technology bare and polymer supported iron oxide based nanoparticles are reported to have high as removal efficiency in different studies zhang et al 2007 jadhav et al 2015 lata and samadder 2016 kwok et al 2018 adlnasab et al 2019 deng et al 2019 those studies suggest that as adsorption capacity is reasonably high 3 0 95 0 mg g fe by different fexoy nano particles inorganic arsenite as iii h3aso3 h2aso3 haso3 2 and arsenate as v h3aso4 h2aso4 haso4 2 are the most abundant species of as dixit and hering 2003 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 sracek et al 2004 bhattacharya et al 2007 in an oxidizing environment as iii can be oxidized to as v which get adsorbed more efficiently by iron based adsorbent bai et al 2016 guo et al 2016 ahmad et al 2018 2019 however most of those materials are suitable for ex situ treatment of as in batch or packed bed reactor system in very few recent studies possibility of in situ remediation of as by injecting zvi kanel et al 2007 2008 liu et al 2016 or iron sulfide fes han et al 2011 xie et al 2016 in the reducing environment is explored abass et al 2016 demonstrated that as iii could be converted into as 0 in the presence of nzvi which subsequently get adsorbed on the surface of nzvi furthermore sorption of as is reported to be extensively high on the surface of the iron oxide shell of zvi guo et al 2016 and on the surface of fes coated sand han et al 2011 xie et al 2016 in a very recent study modification of the nzvi surface by sulfidation s nzvi has been explored which can remove as significantly wu et al 2018 the study suggests that the synergistic effect of iron fe and sulfur resulted in better removal of as iii by s nzvi than that of nzvi the main concern of injecting colloidal adsorbent within the porous media for in situ remediation is their tendency to aggregate and inefficient transport behavior phenrat et al 2007 several studies have focused on the surface modification of nanoparticles to enhance their colloidal stability and transport efficiency phenrat et al 2007 kanel et al 2007 2008 cirtiu et al 2011 raychoudhury et al 2010 raychoudhury et al 2012 zhang et al 2007 several studies have suggested that even with surface modification of nzvi with different polymers such as carboxymethyl cellulose cmc polyacrylic acid paa etc those particles do aggregate and show extensive particle retention in the porous media due to deposition and straining phenrat et al 2007 raychoudhury et al 2010 2014 tosco and sethi 2010 hosseini and tosco 2013 possibility of alteration of the porous media properties such as porosity and hydraulic conductivity due to extensive particle retention is also suggested in the literature raychoudhury et al 2012 tosco and sethi 2010 hosseini and tosco 2013 raychoudhury and surasani 2017 furthermore in one of the field studies zhang 2003 have suggested that polymer stabilized nzvi can promote anaerobic microbial growth in the subsurface and alter geochemical parameters of the surrounding environment in addition to that the toxicity of nanoparticles is a matter of serious concern nanoparticles are even capable of entering into the bloodstream through the skin a recent study sukhanova et al 2018 has suggested the adverse effects of nanoparticles in terms of eco toxicity and also indicated the possible health hazards including respiratory tract inflammation and dna mutations overall the review of the literature suggests fe based materials such as fes or zvi have the extensive potential for treating as iii especially under the anoxic condition that is relevant for in situ remediation however the main challenge lies with injecting the colloidal fe based suspension into the porous media for targeting as only a few studies have reported on the possibility of co precipitation of fe and sulfide under in situ condition by chemical or biological method xie et al 2016 pi et al 2017 fan et al 2018 however the dose of reagents to be injected and the injection schedule are the important parameters that need to be optimized for synthesizing fes in this way the amount of reagents to be injected and the energy for pumping can be minimized that can make the technology more economical furthermore it is also essential to assess the fate of fe which might leach out along with the flow of water the possibility of alteration of porous media properties due to in situ synthesis and retention of fes is also an important aspect that needs attention moreover natural sediment contains several minerals and organic matter that may affect the performance of any proposed technology and thus is an important parameter to be considered based on the author s knowledge the reported studies have not systematically investigated the above aspects which are important and challenging for in situ remediation of as iii by fe based sorbent given the background it could be said that there is a scope to study the possibility of synthesizing fes within the porous media for in situ immobilization of as iii under different injection scheme furthermore it is also important to assess the fate of fe during as iii immobilization to assess the technology as a whole the main objectives of the study are therefore i to assess the possibility of synthesizing fes in situ within the natural sand packed porous media under varying injection scheme ii to evaluate the extent of arsenite as iii immobilization in the fes containing natural porous media and iii to evaluate the fate of fe during immobilization of as iii and its implication on porosity to achieve the objectives several column experiments are performed where ferrous sulfate feso4 and sodium sulfide na2s solution are injected alternatively in the porous media for in situ synthesis of fes with without porous media being pre saturated with as iii then as iii solution is injected and the samples are collected at the outlet for measuring the concentrations of total as and fe after the column experiments the column is sectioned and the porosity along the length of the column is measured 2 material and methods 2 1 reagents all the reagents used in this study are of analytical grade ferrous sulfate feso4 7h2o sodium sulfide na2s 9h2o were obtained from nice chemicals p ltd and rfcl limited respectively sodium arsenite naaso2 was obtained from sigma aldrich reagent grade potassium nitrate kno3 was used for the tracer test central drug house new delhi analytical grade hydrochloric acid hcl or sodium hydroxide naoh solution was used for ph adjustment de ionized di water was used for all purpose a stock solution of 33 3 mg l concentration of as iii was prepared by dissolving naaso2 in di water which is used for further study the stock solution was prepared fresh prior to each experiment in this study all the solutions i e as na2s or feso4 were prepared in deoxygenated di water where the 2000 ml di water was purged with n2 for 1 h prior to preparation of the solution 2 2 natural sediment natural sediment was collected from the shon river bed which is used as the porous media for the column experiment the sediment was sieved using the sieve size of 600 μm 425 μm 300 μm and 150 μm the sand grain within the size range of 150 μm 600 μm was taken as the model porous media the sheaved sand was then washed several times with tap water and then with di water to remove impurities the sand granule was oven dried at 101ᵒc for 24 h the porosity ε of the media was evaluated by weighing the dry and bulk weight of the sediment which was extracted from the packed column 2 3 column experiment in this study a 1 d glass column kontes chromeflex of 1 cm inner diameter id and 15 cm length l was used the washed and dried natural sediment was saturated for 24 h and then are packed within the column during packing the sand was poured at a regular interval and then vibrated for uniform packing the tracer test was performed through the sand packed column where kno3solution was injected from the one end of the column for 2 pore volumes pvs and then di water was flushed for another 2 pvs the no3 concentration was measured at the outlet using uv visible spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 220 nm 2 4 in situ synthesis of fes once the column is packed uniformly and saturated completely several pvs of n2 purged di water was flushed then the feso4 and na2s solution was injected alternately following the different schedules as specified in table 1 and discussed below in this study the feso4 and na2s solution 10 mm or 20 mm was prepared prior to injection by dissolving appropriate moles of feso4 na2s salts in 10 ml of n2 purged di water the reagents feso4 na2s were injected under varying conditions at the column inlet with the help of a peristaltic pump 77120 42 masterflex at a flow rate of 0 043 ml s the column was placed horizontally during the injection of the reagent the effluent was collected at regular intervals for analysis the schematic of the column experiment is presented in fig 1 and the photograph of the experimental set up is also presented in fig s1 different injection schedules were adopted as specified in case 1 case 2 case 3 case 4 case 5 and case 6 fig s2 table 1 in cases 1 to 3 the reagent is applied in di water saturated natural sediment packed column whereas in cases 4 to 6 the reagent was injected in as iii pre saturated sediment packed porous media to represent a realistic groundwater scenario in case 1 fig s2 a table 1 n2 purged di water was injected for 0 2 pvs equivalent to dead volume at the intermediate stage between alternative injection of feso4 10 mm and na2s 10 mm solution here 0 5 pvs of each reagent feso4 na2s was injected for three cycles total 1 pv of feso4 and na2s in each cycle with a total injection period of 3 pvs of reagents the injection schedule adopted in case 2 was similar to that of case 1 however in case 2 fig s2 b injection of intermediate di water was excluded in the case of 3 fig s2 c the alternate injection of reagents was carried out for 1 5 pvs a full cycle with 0 5 pvs injection of each reagent followed 0 25 pvs injection of each reagent injection schedule alternate injection and injection frequency for case 4 were kept the same as of case 3 however in the case of 4 fig s2 d the concentration of each reagent feso4 na2s was increased to 20 mm and the reagents were injected in the as iii containing sand packed column in the case of 5 fig s2 e feso4 20 mm and na2s 20 mm solution were injected for a total period of 1 pv where 0 25 pvs of each of the reagent was injected alternately for two cycles for case 6 fig s2 f the injection schedule and frequency were kept the same as case 2 total 3 pvs of 10 mm reagents are injected but the reagents are injected in as iii containing sand packed column the detailed injection schedules used in different cases are presented in fig s2 and summurized in table 1 2 5 injection of arsenic after the in situ synthesis of fes the as iii solution was passed through the column under constant flow case 2 and 3 or constant head case 4 to 6 condition the solution was purged with n2 during the injection in the case of 2 and 3 the as iii solution of 450 25 μg l was injected after synthesis of fes using a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 0 00132 ml s where in case of 4 to 6 as iii solution of 330 15 μg l was injected in the packed column until as concentration reaches a steady state few studies ahmed et al 2004 ghosh et al 2007 rahman et al 2015 have reported that the as concentration in several groundwater samples collected from different contaminated regions of bangladesh and india are frequently detected in the range of 100 μg l to 846 μg l moreover in a few locations the concentration of as has even reached above 1000 μg l given the reported value of as concentration in the natural groundwater of those regions where the problem is most severe a reasonably high value of as iii concentration in the range of 330 μg l 450 μg l is chosen in this study the in situ coating of fes was done as described above the flow of as iii solution through the column was continued where a constant head condition was maintained by storing as iii solution in an overhead tank fig 1 the flow rate of as iii through the porous media was maintained in the range of 0 0056 0 0005 ml s by placing the tank at a suitable height the ph values of the as iii solution in all the cases are maintained at 7 9 0 1 which is relevant for groundwater the n2 purging was done in the tank containing as iii solution to maintain the anoxic condition the flow rate was maintained such that the laminar flow condition is ensured and to represent the realistic groundwater flow rate the schematic of the experimental set up is presented in fig 1 the samples were collected at the outlet at an interval of 0 2 pvs during fes synthesis and 1 pv during as iii injection and the concentrations of total as and fe was measured the result is represented in the form of a breakthrough curve btc in which the y axis represents the normalized effluent concentration c c 0 of as and fe and the x axis represents pv vt εl a dimensionless parameter to represent time t 2 6 sectioning of column to estimate the change in porosity along the length of the column the column was sectioned after each experiment for extracting sand in an undisturbed way the column was placed vertically and di water was injected from the top end at a negligible rate so that the entire sand mass moves vertically once the sand started to exit from the bottom end of the column then the sample was collected section wise and the porosity of each section was evaluated by weighing the wet weight and dry weight of the sediment 2 7 sample analysis the effluent collected at the outlet after each column experiment was acid digested by adding concentrated hno3 with a sample to acid ratio of 9 1 following the method epa 3015a the digested samples were diluted and filtered through a 0 22 μm syringe filter before analysis the concentration of as was measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry 7800 icp ms agilent technologies whereas the concentration of fe was measured using atomic absorption spectrometer aasice 3000 series thermo scientific limit of detection for measurement of fe using the instrument aas is 0 01 mg l and for as iii using the icp ms is 1 μg l furthermore the protocol is tested for as recovery with different concentrations of as iii in the presence of fe and vice versa the analysis shows that based on weight percentage 109 7 of as from na2aso2 and 92 8 of fe from feso4 9h2o was recovered when measured using icp ms and aas respectively following the digestion protocol described above 3 results and discussion 3 1 in situ synthesis of fes within natural sand packed porous media sieve analysis of the natural sediment indicates that the average diameter of natural sediment used in this study is 0 36 mm for the in situ synthesis of fes in the porous media feso4 and na2s solution was injected alternatively fig 1 at a rate of 0 043 ml s following different schedules table 1 fig s1 as mentioned earlier in case 1 to case 3 the reagents are injected in the as iii free porous media and in the case of 4 to case 6 the reagents are injected in the as iii pre saturated porous media the appearance of black color in the column fig s1 after immediate alternate injection of reagents suggests the formation of fes in the porous media the effluent fe concentration at the outlet was measured and the normalized fe concentrations c c 0 for all the cases are presented in fig 2 in the case of 1 and case 2 the reagents 10 mm are injected for the three cycles 3 pvs with 4 33 mg of net injected fe in both cases an increase in the effluent fe concentration beyond 1 5 pvs is observed and thus in case 3 only 1 5 pvs of reagents are injected the retained percentage of fe during injection of reagents for case 1 10 mm reagent 3 pvs with di water at intermediate state case 2 10 mm 3 pvs and case 3 10 mm 1 5 pvs are 89 93 and 99 9 respectively case 1 is not considered for as iii immobilization given that the retained percentage of fe is minimum with higher duration of injection in case 2 the maximum mass of fe 3 9 mg is retained with 93 of the injected mass of fe whereas in case 3 the maximum percentage 99 9 of fe is retained in case 2 maximum mass is retained as the injected mass of fe was higher considering this in the case of 4 a combined strategy was adopted where the concentration of fe was increased to double 20 mm and the duration of injection was kept the same as of case 3 1 5 pvs this is done to maintain the same amount of injected mass of fe as that of case 2 but to reduce the duration of injection mass of fe retained in the column to coat the porous media was considered a critical factor as as iii is expected to associate with fe retained in the porous media from case 4 to case 6 the fes was synthesized in the as iii pre saturated porous media during the injection of reagents it is observed fig 2 that the fe has started to rise at the outlet after 1 pv and the mass balance calculation suggests that almost 93 5 of injected fe has retained within the porous media in the case of 4 considering a sharp increase in fe at the outlet beyond 1 pv the duration of injection is reduced to 1 pv in the case of 5 maintaining the reagent concentration the same at 20 mm with this modification the retained mass of fe is achieved 100 for case 5 in case 6 10 mm reagents are injected for 3 pvs in as iii pre saturated media the injection schedule adopted in case 6 is such that the injected mass of fe for case 6 is same as of case 4 but with a different concentration and volume of injects the retained mass of fe in the porous media during the synthesis of fes for case 6 10 mm 3 pvs is 86 7 though the percentage of retained fe is the maximum in case 5 the net mass of fe retained is more in the case of 4 and 6 thus for immobilization of as iii all the three cases case 4 to case 6 are selected for further study 3 2 immobilization of as iii and the fate of fe in fes containing natural porous media pre saturated with di water case 2 and case 3 the btc for tracer test and the normalized as iii concentration at the outlet of sediment packed column is presented in fig 3 a the tracer test result shows that the tracer no3 concentration is reaching almost complete breakthrough c c 0 0 98 at 1 6 pvs the btc of tracer suggests homogenous and uniform packing of porous media a steep increase in as iii concentration is observed beyond 5 pvs and it reaches a steady state c c 0 0 63 at approximately 12 pvs when injected in di water saturated sediment packed column this result indicates some amount of retardation of as iii in the blank sediment packed column for immobilization of as iii 450 25 μg l of as iii solution was injected through fes synthesized porous media at a flow rate of 0 00132 ml s using a peristaltic pump the ph values of all the as iii solutions are maintained at 7 9 0 1 the fes synthesis was done following the schedule of case 2 and case 3 as mentioned earlier the result fig 3b suggests that at the initial stage up to 5 pvs the effluent concentration of as iii c c 0 0 38 is slightly high compared to fig 3a whereas beyond 5 pvs and up to 17 pvs the c c 0 is varying within a range of 0 2 0 1 comparing the btc of as iii in the unmodified porous media fig 3a c c 0 0 63 at 12 pvs and fes containing porous media fig 3b c c 0 0 2 0 09 at 12 pvs it could be observed that a significant amount of as iii get immobilized in fes containing porous media the mass balance calculation suggests table 1 that up to 17 pvs almost 88 5 and 83 9 of the injected mass of as iii is retained in the case of 2 and 3 respectively the retention of as iii in the fes containing porous media is likely to be attributed by the combined effect of chemical reaction and co precipitation bostick and fendorf 2003 blanchard et al 2007 gallegos et al 2007 xie et al 2016 bhattacharya et al 2007 jeong et al 2009 the as iii is expected to react with fes following the reaction r1 especially at low ph han et al 2011 then the product ass is likely to get precipitate on the fes and newly formed ferric hydroxide surface bostick and fendorf 2003 gallegos et al 2007 however at high ph around ph 9 sorption is expected to be the dominant mechanism for as iii removal r1 2fes h2aso3 2h2o ass fe2 oh 5 hs the possibility of release of fe from the fes containing porous media along with the flow of as iii is assessed by monitoring the fe concentration at the outlet fig 3c the result suggests the elution of fe at the outlet is not very significant at the initial stage up to 5 pvs a slight high c c 0 0 01 around 5 mg l effluent concentration is observed however beyond 5 pvs a negligible amount of fe is eluted the mass balance table 1 calculation shows that up to 17 pvs almost 90 1 and 94 9 of injected fe is retained within the porous media overall it could be said that the retention of fe is comparatively high in case 3 94 9 compared to that of case 2 90 1 however the immobilized mass of as iii is high in the case of 2 88 5 compared to that of case 3 83 9 thus case 2 is considered the better scenario and in the next step case 6 is adopted keeping similar injection schedule for reagents as of case 2 furthermore another injection schedule case 4 is adopted to improve the fe retention where the duration of reagent injection is reduced to 1 5 pvs and the concentration of fe has increased to 20 mm as mentioned earlier 3 3 immobilization of as iii and the fate of fe in fes containing natural porous media pre saturated with as iii solution case 4 to case 6 in this series of column experiments the natural sediment packed column is pre saturated with 330 15 μg l of as iii this is done to represent the more realistic groundwater condition where the porous media is expected to contain as contamination prior to injection of reagent for the in situ synthesis of fes then the fes in synthesized following the injection schedule of cases 4 5 and 6 as discussed earlier table 1 the as iii solution is passed through the porous media at a rate of 0 0056 0 0005 ml s under constant head condition the ph of the as iii solution is maintained at 7 9 0 1 the result fig 4 a suggests that the effluent concentration of as iii decreases significantly with respect to influent concentration for all the cases for example c c 0 is in the range of 0 21 0 42 0 21 to 0 53 and 0 24 to 0 41 within the pvs of 5 35 for case 4 case 5 and case 6 respectively where the c c 0 reaches a steady state plateau at c c 0 0 63 beyond 12 pvs for as iii when transported through unmodified porous media mass balance calculation indicates that up to 17 pvs 74 25 59 8 and 65 4 of injected as iii and at the end of 35 pvs 72 8 65 1 and 67 1 of injected as iii are immobilized in the fes containing porous media for the case 4 case 5 and case 6 respectively with respect to as iii retention case 4 shows the best performance in immobilizing as iii compared to that of case 5 and case 6 the mass balance calculation indicates that the as iii immobilization for most optimized case 72 9 removal has resulted in removal of 9 80 mg as g of fe for a duration of 35 pvs it is important to note that during the duration of 35 pvs not even 50 of injected as iii was eluted c c0 0 2 suggesting that the actual as removal capacity by the fes sand is much higher some of the studies have used different adsorbent in the column system shows as iii removal in a similar range as observed in this study for example doped activated carbon can adsorb 2 60 mg as g 3 30 mg as g of adsorbent sharma et al 2010 fe nanoparticle embedded polymer composites can remove 3 mg as g of adsorbent savina et al 2011 fe hydrotalcite supported magnetite nanoparticles can adsorb 0 121 mg as g adsorbent türk and alp 2014 feoh coated alumina can remove 7 65 mg as g of adsorbent hlavay and polyák 2005 in the packed column system han et al 2011 have reported that 45 mg as iii is removed per g of fes coated sand in the batch system at ph 5 however at ph 7 the as iii removal capacity is reduced to 11 mg as g of adsorbent they have also suggested that in the batch system the as iii removal capacity is always higher than that of the column system under constant flow condition overall the as iii removal capacity by in situ synthesized fes in the porous media used in this study is reasonably good and within the higher range of other reported studies immobilization of as iii in the porous media containing fe and s is likely to be attributed by the combined effect of chemical reaction co precipitation and sorption bhattacharya et al 2007 when the reagents such as feso4 and na2s are injected in the as iii pre saturated porous media the following additional reaction r2 and r3 might have taken place along with the reaction r1 as suggested by xie et al 2016 the formation of as2s3 and feass is expected which is likely to precipitate and sorbed on the retained fe surface in one of the studies gallegos et al 2008 have suggested that as iii fes interaction is controlled by the formation of realgar and some secondary products whereas han et al 2011 have suggested the removal of as iii by fes coated sand is dominated by the formation of orpiment at ph 5 and by adsorption at ph 9 r2 3s 2 3fe 2 2h3aso3 as2s3 3fe oh 2 r3 3s 2 3fe 2 h3aso3 fes2 feass 3fe oh 3 the fate of fe is also evaluated where the effluent concentration of fe is measured throughout the flow of as iii the result fig 4b suggests that at the initial stage immediately after injection of reagent a relatively high amount of fe has eluded the normalized effluent concentration c c 0 at the initial time around 3 pvs is 0 06 0 03 and 0 05 for case 4 case 5 and case 6 respectively however the effluent concentration reduces extensively towards the later stage and almost no fe is eluted beyond 15 pvs for case 4 and case 5 the mass balance calculation indicates that though during injection of reagents 93 5 case 4 100 case 5 and 86 6 case 6 of fe has retained in the porous media however along with as iii some amount of fe has eluded the result suggests in the case of 4 up to 58 9 up to 35 pvs of fe has retained which resulted in immobilization of 72 9 of as iii whereas in cases 5 and 6 retention of 58 3 and 58 9 of fe resulted in immobilization of 65 1 and 67 2 of as iii respectively the negligible amount of fe is observed at the outlet in the later stages suggesting that in the longer run fe concentration in water might not be a problem furthermore fe is ubiquitous in nature and a small amount of release of fe in dissolved form might not be a great concern from a toxicity point of view the results suggest that though the retained mass of fe within the porous media as fes is similar around 58 5 0 4 for all the three cases with different injection schedule however the as iii immobilization efficiency 72 9 is slightly high in the case of 4 compared to that of others case 5 and 6 case 6 shows the second best performance 67 2 with the injection of the same amount of fe 4 3 mg the duration of injection for case 4 1 5 pvs is half of that for case 6 3 pvs that suggests that the energy consumption related to injection would be less for case 4 compared to that of case 6 considering as iii immobilization efficiency and the injection duration case 4 is found to be the most optimal injection schedule that can immobilize a significant amount of as iii in the porous media by the in situ synthesis of fes 3 4 impact on porous media properties due to fes synthesis and arsenic immobilization in addition to the in situ synthesis of fes in the porous media and as iii immobilization the possible impact of the formation of fes and retention of as iii on the porous media property such as on porosity is also assessed the porosity of the natural sediment along the length of the packed column is measured at different stages following the protocol as mentioned earlier the result suggests that the porosity of the packed porous media along the length of the column is uniform 0 4 0 02 even after injection of reagents and formation of fes injected fe 4 33 mg no further change in porosity 0 4 0 02 is observed fig 5 the association and retention of as iii in the fes containing packed column does not influence the porosity 0 4 0 02 of the porous media throughout the column fig 5 furthermore the flow rate under the constant head condition has not changed after the injection of reagents and due to immobilization of as iii overall it could be said that the in situ formation of fes in the porous media and retention of as iii on the fes coating does not have any impact on the porous media properties such as porosity hydraulic conductivity and on the flow rate through the porous media overall the as iii removal by in situ synthesized fes is found to be significantly high under the controlled laboratory condition and the in situ as iii immobilization by fes does not have much implication on the porous media properties however it is important to note that the complex geochemistry in the natural groundwater system are likely to affect the as iii removal efficiency differently bhattacharya et al 2004 2007 sracek et al 2004 vega et al 2017 ahmad and bhattacharya 2019 which can be explored in the future study 4 conclusion in this study the optimal schedule for in situ synthesis of fes within the natural sand packed porous media and its performance in immobilizing as iii is assessed overall the results indicate that fes can be effectively synthesized in situ in the porous media and a very high percentage of fe 90 can be retained in the long term when the porous media is not pre saturated with as iii the immobilization of as iii is also very high 80 up to 17 pvs in those cases in a more realistic condition where the porous media is pre saturated with as iii the optimal fes synthesis scheme is identified case 4 amongst the tried scenarios injection of highly concentrated 20 mm reagents i e feso4 and na2s for 1 5 pvs shows the optimal result for immobilization of as iii 72 retained up to 35 pvs in this case though a relatively high amount of fe has mobilized along with as iii at the initial stage but at the later stage no fe is detected at the outlet and almost 60 of fe is retained within the porous media overall it could be concluded that fes is synthesized efficiently within the porous media which can immobilize as iii significantly in the anoxic condition furthermore the formation of fes and immobilization of as iii does not alter the porous media properties or the flow condition thus it could be stated that the technique has the potential to apply in the real field condition for mitigating arsenic contamination in situ however it can also be noted that the presence of co ions and different flow conditions might affect the as iii uptake efficiency by synthesized fes under natural groundwater condition for example the presence of silicate sulfate etc may reduce the performance of as iii removal depending on ph furthermore ferrous ion might present in the natural groundwater which may involve in reaction with injected na2s and can form fes that might reduce the required amount of feso4 inject in this study a moderate groundwater flow rate is adopted a lower groundwater flow rate than that adopted in the experiment can result in higher contact time between the deposited fes and the flowing as iii which can enhance as iii removal efficiency in the natural system under groundwater condition the as iii uptake mechanism would be very complex in nature and will be studied in the real field scenario as a future scope

12186,the main objectives of the study are i to assess the possibility of synthesizing ferrous sulfide fes in situ within the natural sand packed porous media ii to evaluate the extent of arsenite as iii immobilization in the fes containing natural porous media and iii to evaluate the fate of iron fe during immobilization of as iii and its implication on the porosity several column experiments are performed where ferrous sulfate feso4 and sodium sulfide na2s solution are injected alternatively in the porous media for synthesis of fes with without porous media being pre saturated with as iii then as iii solution is injected from one end the results indicate that fes can be effectively synthesized throughout the column the immobilization of as iii is also very high 80 up to 17 pvs in those cases with as iii pre saturated condition the injection of 20 mm reagents for 1 5 pvs shows the optimal result for immobilization of as iii 72 retained up to 35 pvs in this case though the relatively high amount of fe has mobilized along with as iii at the initial stage however towards the later stage no fe is detected at the outlet and almost 60 of injected fe is retained within the porous media graphical abstract image 1 keywords arsenic ferrous sulfide fate and transport in situ remediation natural sediment 1 introduction arsenic as contamination in groundwater has become a major problem in many parts of the world the occurrences of as in the alluvial aquifers in the eastern part of india and several districts of bangladesh are reported extensively in the literature bhattacharya et al 1997 2004 ahmed et al 2004 vega et al 2017 groundwater contamination by as in bangladesh is recognized as the largest poisoning of the population in human history smith et al 2000 the population at several locations in the different provinces of china and latin america are also exposed to as contamination natural occurrences of as in the groundwater are identified at few locations in the united states and canada smedley and kinniburgh 2002 bundschuh et al 2012 maity et al 2017 litter et al 2019 several recent studies have explored the potential of different metal oxide based nanoparticles such as iron oxides nfexoy zero valent iron nzvi alumina nal2o3 titanium dioxide ntio2 zirconium dioxide nzro2 nickel oxide nnio magnesium oxide nmgo etc for removal of as from water jadhav et al 2015 lata and samadder 2016 adlnasab et al 2019 deng et al 2019 hosseini et al 2018 de et al 2019 arabnezhad et al 2017 raychoudhury et al 2015 yang et al 2018 arsenic removal by the iron based adsorbent is the most widely used technology bare and polymer supported iron oxide based nanoparticles are reported to have high as removal efficiency in different studies zhang et al 2007 jadhav et al 2015 lata and samadder 2016 kwok et al 2018 adlnasab et al 2019 deng et al 2019 those studies suggest that as adsorption capacity is reasonably high 3 0 95 0 mg g fe by different fexoy nano particles inorganic arsenite as iii h3aso3 h2aso3 haso3 2 and arsenate as v h3aso4 h2aso4 haso4 2 are the most abundant species of as dixit and hering 2003 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 sracek et al 2004 bhattacharya et al 2007 in an oxidizing environment as iii can be oxidized to as v which get adsorbed more efficiently by iron based adsorbent bai et al 2016 guo et al 2016 ahmad et al 2018 2019 however most of those materials are suitable for ex situ treatment of as in batch or packed bed reactor system in very few recent studies possibility of in situ remediation of as by injecting zvi kanel et al 2007 2008 liu et al 2016 or iron sulfide fes han et al 2011 xie et al 2016 in the reducing environment is explored abass et al 2016 demonstrated that as iii could be converted into as 0 in the presence of nzvi which subsequently get adsorbed on the surface of nzvi furthermore sorption of as is reported to be extensively high on the surface of the iron oxide shell of zvi guo et al 2016 and on the surface of fes coated sand han et al 2011 xie et al 2016 in a very recent study modification of the nzvi surface by sulfidation s nzvi has been explored which can remove as significantly wu et al 2018 the study suggests that the synergistic effect of iron fe and sulfur resulted in better removal of as iii by s nzvi than that of nzvi the main concern of injecting colloidal adsorbent within the porous media for in situ remediation is their tendency to aggregate and inefficient transport behavior phenrat et al 2007 several studies have focused on the surface modification of nanoparticles to enhance their colloidal stability and transport efficiency phenrat et al 2007 kanel et al 2007 2008 cirtiu et al 2011 raychoudhury et al 2010 raychoudhury et al 2012 zhang et al 2007 several studies have suggested that even with surface modification of nzvi with different polymers such as carboxymethyl cellulose cmc polyacrylic acid paa etc those particles do aggregate and show extensive particle retention in the porous media due to deposition and straining phenrat et al 2007 raychoudhury et al 2010 2014 tosco and sethi 2010 hosseini and tosco 2013 possibility of alteration of the porous media properties such as porosity and hydraulic conductivity due to extensive particle retention is also suggested in the literature raychoudhury et al 2012 tosco and sethi 2010 hosseini and tosco 2013 raychoudhury and surasani 2017 furthermore in one of the field studies zhang 2003 have suggested that polymer stabilized nzvi can promote anaerobic microbial growth in the subsurface and alter geochemical parameters of the surrounding environment in addition to that the toxicity of nanoparticles is a matter of serious concern nanoparticles are even capable of entering into the bloodstream through the skin a recent study sukhanova et al 2018 has suggested the adverse effects of nanoparticles in terms of eco toxicity and also indicated the possible health hazards including respiratory tract inflammation and dna mutations overall the review of the literature suggests fe based materials such as fes or zvi have the extensive potential for treating as iii especially under the anoxic condition that is relevant for in situ remediation however the main challenge lies with injecting the colloidal fe based suspension into the porous media for targeting as only a few studies have reported on the possibility of co precipitation of fe and sulfide under in situ condition by chemical or biological method xie et al 2016 pi et al 2017 fan et al 2018 however the dose of reagents to be injected and the injection schedule are the important parameters that need to be optimized for synthesizing fes in this way the amount of reagents to be injected and the energy for pumping can be minimized that can make the technology more economical furthermore it is also essential to assess the fate of fe which might leach out along with the flow of water the possibility of alteration of porous media properties due to in situ synthesis and retention of fes is also an important aspect that needs attention moreover natural sediment contains several minerals and organic matter that may affect the performance of any proposed technology and thus is an important parameter to be considered based on the author s knowledge the reported studies have not systematically investigated the above aspects which are important and challenging for in situ remediation of as iii by fe based sorbent given the background it could be said that there is a scope to study the possibility of synthesizing fes within the porous media for in situ immobilization of as iii under different injection scheme furthermore it is also important to assess the fate of fe during as iii immobilization to assess the technology as a whole the main objectives of the study are therefore i to assess the possibility of synthesizing fes in situ within the natural sand packed porous media under varying injection scheme ii to evaluate the extent of arsenite as iii immobilization in the fes containing natural porous media and iii to evaluate the fate of fe during immobilization of as iii and its implication on porosity to achieve the objectives several column experiments are performed where ferrous sulfate feso4 and sodium sulfide na2s solution are injected alternatively in the porous media for in situ synthesis of fes with without porous media being pre saturated with as iii then as iii solution is injected and the samples are collected at the outlet for measuring the concentrations of total as and fe after the column experiments the column is sectioned and the porosity along the length of the column is measured 2 material and methods 2 1 reagents all the reagents used in this study are of analytical grade ferrous sulfate feso4 7h2o sodium sulfide na2s 9h2o were obtained from nice chemicals p ltd and rfcl limited respectively sodium arsenite naaso2 was obtained from sigma aldrich reagent grade potassium nitrate kno3 was used for the tracer test central drug house new delhi analytical grade hydrochloric acid hcl or sodium hydroxide naoh solution was used for ph adjustment de ionized di water was used for all purpose a stock solution of 33 3 mg l concentration of as iii was prepared by dissolving naaso2 in di water which is used for further study the stock solution was prepared fresh prior to each experiment in this study all the solutions i e as na2s or feso4 were prepared in deoxygenated di water where the 2000 ml di water was purged with n2 for 1 h prior to preparation of the solution 2 2 natural sediment natural sediment was collected from the shon river bed which is used as the porous media for the column experiment the sediment was sieved using the sieve size of 600 μm 425 μm 300 μm and 150 μm the sand grain within the size range of 150 μm 600 μm was taken as the model porous media the sheaved sand was then washed several times with tap water and then with di water to remove impurities the sand granule was oven dried at 101ᵒc for 24 h the porosity ε of the media was evaluated by weighing the dry and bulk weight of the sediment which was extracted from the packed column 2 3 column experiment in this study a 1 d glass column kontes chromeflex of 1 cm inner diameter id and 15 cm length l was used the washed and dried natural sediment was saturated for 24 h and then are packed within the column during packing the sand was poured at a regular interval and then vibrated for uniform packing the tracer test was performed through the sand packed column where kno3solution was injected from the one end of the column for 2 pore volumes pvs and then di water was flushed for another 2 pvs the no3 concentration was measured at the outlet using uv visible spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 220 nm 2 4 in situ synthesis of fes once the column is packed uniformly and saturated completely several pvs of n2 purged di water was flushed then the feso4 and na2s solution was injected alternately following the different schedules as specified in table 1 and discussed below in this study the feso4 and na2s solution 10 mm or 20 mm was prepared prior to injection by dissolving appropriate moles of feso4 na2s salts in 10 ml of n2 purged di water the reagents feso4 na2s were injected under varying conditions at the column inlet with the help of a peristaltic pump 77120 42 masterflex at a flow rate of 0 043 ml s the column was placed horizontally during the injection of the reagent the effluent was collected at regular intervals for analysis the schematic of the column experiment is presented in fig 1 and the photograph of the experimental set up is also presented in fig s1 different injection schedules were adopted as specified in case 1 case 2 case 3 case 4 case 5 and case 6 fig s2 table 1 in cases 1 to 3 the reagent is applied in di water saturated natural sediment packed column whereas in cases 4 to 6 the reagent was injected in as iii pre saturated sediment packed porous media to represent a realistic groundwater scenario in case 1 fig s2 a table 1 n2 purged di water was injected for 0 2 pvs equivalent to dead volume at the intermediate stage between alternative injection of feso4 10 mm and na2s 10 mm solution here 0 5 pvs of each reagent feso4 na2s was injected for three cycles total 1 pv of feso4 and na2s in each cycle with a total injection period of 3 pvs of reagents the injection schedule adopted in case 2 was similar to that of case 1 however in case 2 fig s2 b injection of intermediate di water was excluded in the case of 3 fig s2 c the alternate injection of reagents was carried out for 1 5 pvs a full cycle with 0 5 pvs injection of each reagent followed 0 25 pvs injection of each reagent injection schedule alternate injection and injection frequency for case 4 were kept the same as of case 3 however in the case of 4 fig s2 d the concentration of each reagent feso4 na2s was increased to 20 mm and the reagents were injected in the as iii containing sand packed column in the case of 5 fig s2 e feso4 20 mm and na2s 20 mm solution were injected for a total period of 1 pv where 0 25 pvs of each of the reagent was injected alternately for two cycles for case 6 fig s2 f the injection schedule and frequency were kept the same as case 2 total 3 pvs of 10 mm reagents are injected but the reagents are injected in as iii containing sand packed column the detailed injection schedules used in different cases are presented in fig s2 and summurized in table 1 2 5 injection of arsenic after the in situ synthesis of fes the as iii solution was passed through the column under constant flow case 2 and 3 or constant head case 4 to 6 condition the solution was purged with n2 during the injection in the case of 2 and 3 the as iii solution of 450 25 μg l was injected after synthesis of fes using a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 0 00132 ml s where in case of 4 to 6 as iii solution of 330 15 μg l was injected in the packed column until as concentration reaches a steady state few studies ahmed et al 2004 ghosh et al 2007 rahman et al 2015 have reported that the as concentration in several groundwater samples collected from different contaminated regions of bangladesh and india are frequently detected in the range of 100 μg l to 846 μg l moreover in a few locations the concentration of as has even reached above 1000 μg l given the reported value of as concentration in the natural groundwater of those regions where the problem is most severe a reasonably high value of as iii concentration in the range of 330 μg l 450 μg l is chosen in this study the in situ coating of fes was done as described above the flow of as iii solution through the column was continued where a constant head condition was maintained by storing as iii solution in an overhead tank fig 1 the flow rate of as iii through the porous media was maintained in the range of 0 0056 0 0005 ml s by placing the tank at a suitable height the ph values of the as iii solution in all the cases are maintained at 7 9 0 1 which is relevant for groundwater the n2 purging was done in the tank containing as iii solution to maintain the anoxic condition the flow rate was maintained such that the laminar flow condition is ensured and to represent the realistic groundwater flow rate the schematic of the experimental set up is presented in fig 1 the samples were collected at the outlet at an interval of 0 2 pvs during fes synthesis and 1 pv during as iii injection and the concentrations of total as and fe was measured the result is represented in the form of a breakthrough curve btc in which the y axis represents the normalized effluent concentration c c 0 of as and fe and the x axis represents pv vt εl a dimensionless parameter to represent time t 2 6 sectioning of column to estimate the change in porosity along the length of the column the column was sectioned after each experiment for extracting sand in an undisturbed way the column was placed vertically and di water was injected from the top end at a negligible rate so that the entire sand mass moves vertically once the sand started to exit from the bottom end of the column then the sample was collected section wise and the porosity of each section was evaluated by weighing the wet weight and dry weight of the sediment 2 7 sample analysis the effluent collected at the outlet after each column experiment was acid digested by adding concentrated hno3 with a sample to acid ratio of 9 1 following the method epa 3015a the digested samples were diluted and filtered through a 0 22 μm syringe filter before analysis the concentration of as was measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry 7800 icp ms agilent technologies whereas the concentration of fe was measured using atomic absorption spectrometer aasice 3000 series thermo scientific limit of detection for measurement of fe using the instrument aas is 0 01 mg l and for as iii using the icp ms is 1 μg l furthermore the protocol is tested for as recovery with different concentrations of as iii in the presence of fe and vice versa the analysis shows that based on weight percentage 109 7 of as from na2aso2 and 92 8 of fe from feso4 9h2o was recovered when measured using icp ms and aas respectively following the digestion protocol described above 3 results and discussion 3 1 in situ synthesis of fes within natural sand packed porous media sieve analysis of the natural sediment indicates that the average diameter of natural sediment used in this study is 0 36 mm for the in situ synthesis of fes in the porous media feso4 and na2s solution was injected alternatively fig 1 at a rate of 0 043 ml s following different schedules table 1 fig s1 as mentioned earlier in case 1 to case 3 the reagents are injected in the as iii free porous media and in the case of 4 to case 6 the reagents are injected in the as iii pre saturated porous media the appearance of black color in the column fig s1 after immediate alternate injection of reagents suggests the formation of fes in the porous media the effluent fe concentration at the outlet was measured and the normalized fe concentrations c c 0 for all the cases are presented in fig 2 in the case of 1 and case 2 the reagents 10 mm are injected for the three cycles 3 pvs with 4 33 mg of net injected fe in both cases an increase in the effluent fe concentration beyond 1 5 pvs is observed and thus in case 3 only 1 5 pvs of reagents are injected the retained percentage of fe during injection of reagents for case 1 10 mm reagent 3 pvs with di water at intermediate state case 2 10 mm 3 pvs and case 3 10 mm 1 5 pvs are 89 93 and 99 9 respectively case 1 is not considered for as iii immobilization given that the retained percentage of fe is minimum with higher duration of injection in case 2 the maximum mass of fe 3 9 mg is retained with 93 of the injected mass of fe whereas in case 3 the maximum percentage 99 9 of fe is retained in case 2 maximum mass is retained as the injected mass of fe was higher considering this in the case of 4 a combined strategy was adopted where the concentration of fe was increased to double 20 mm and the duration of injection was kept the same as of case 3 1 5 pvs this is done to maintain the same amount of injected mass of fe as that of case 2 but to reduce the duration of injection mass of fe retained in the column to coat the porous media was considered a critical factor as as iii is expected to associate with fe retained in the porous media from case 4 to case 6 the fes was synthesized in the as iii pre saturated porous media during the injection of reagents it is observed fig 2 that the fe has started to rise at the outlet after 1 pv and the mass balance calculation suggests that almost 93 5 of injected fe has retained within the porous media in the case of 4 considering a sharp increase in fe at the outlet beyond 1 pv the duration of injection is reduced to 1 pv in the case of 5 maintaining the reagent concentration the same at 20 mm with this modification the retained mass of fe is achieved 100 for case 5 in case 6 10 mm reagents are injected for 3 pvs in as iii pre saturated media the injection schedule adopted in case 6 is such that the injected mass of fe for case 6 is same as of case 4 but with a different concentration and volume of injects the retained mass of fe in the porous media during the synthesis of fes for case 6 10 mm 3 pvs is 86 7 though the percentage of retained fe is the maximum in case 5 the net mass of fe retained is more in the case of 4 and 6 thus for immobilization of as iii all the three cases case 4 to case 6 are selected for further study 3 2 immobilization of as iii and the fate of fe in fes containing natural porous media pre saturated with di water case 2 and case 3 the btc for tracer test and the normalized as iii concentration at the outlet of sediment packed column is presented in fig 3 a the tracer test result shows that the tracer no3 concentration is reaching almost complete breakthrough c c 0 0 98 at 1 6 pvs the btc of tracer suggests homogenous and uniform packing of porous media a steep increase in as iii concentration is observed beyond 5 pvs and it reaches a steady state c c 0 0 63 at approximately 12 pvs when injected in di water saturated sediment packed column this result indicates some amount of retardation of as iii in the blank sediment packed column for immobilization of as iii 450 25 μg l of as iii solution was injected through fes synthesized porous media at a flow rate of 0 00132 ml s using a peristaltic pump the ph values of all the as iii solutions are maintained at 7 9 0 1 the fes synthesis was done following the schedule of case 2 and case 3 as mentioned earlier the result fig 3b suggests that at the initial stage up to 5 pvs the effluent concentration of as iii c c 0 0 38 is slightly high compared to fig 3a whereas beyond 5 pvs and up to 17 pvs the c c 0 is varying within a range of 0 2 0 1 comparing the btc of as iii in the unmodified porous media fig 3a c c 0 0 63 at 12 pvs and fes containing porous media fig 3b c c 0 0 2 0 09 at 12 pvs it could be observed that a significant amount of as iii get immobilized in fes containing porous media the mass balance calculation suggests table 1 that up to 17 pvs almost 88 5 and 83 9 of the injected mass of as iii is retained in the case of 2 and 3 respectively the retention of as iii in the fes containing porous media is likely to be attributed by the combined effect of chemical reaction and co precipitation bostick and fendorf 2003 blanchard et al 2007 gallegos et al 2007 xie et al 2016 bhattacharya et al 2007 jeong et al 2009 the as iii is expected to react with fes following the reaction r1 especially at low ph han et al 2011 then the product ass is likely to get precipitate on the fes and newly formed ferric hydroxide surface bostick and fendorf 2003 gallegos et al 2007 however at high ph around ph 9 sorption is expected to be the dominant mechanism for as iii removal r1 2fes h2aso3 2h2o ass fe2 oh 5 hs the possibility of release of fe from the fes containing porous media along with the flow of as iii is assessed by monitoring the fe concentration at the outlet fig 3c the result suggests the elution of fe at the outlet is not very significant at the initial stage up to 5 pvs a slight high c c 0 0 01 around 5 mg l effluent concentration is observed however beyond 5 pvs a negligible amount of fe is eluted the mass balance table 1 calculation shows that up to 17 pvs almost 90 1 and 94 9 of injected fe is retained within the porous media overall it could be said that the retention of fe is comparatively high in case 3 94 9 compared to that of case 2 90 1 however the immobilized mass of as iii is high in the case of 2 88 5 compared to that of case 3 83 9 thus case 2 is considered the better scenario and in the next step case 6 is adopted keeping similar injection schedule for reagents as of case 2 furthermore another injection schedule case 4 is adopted to improve the fe retention where the duration of reagent injection is reduced to 1 5 pvs and the concentration of fe has increased to 20 mm as mentioned earlier 3 3 immobilization of as iii and the fate of fe in fes containing natural porous media pre saturated with as iii solution case 4 to case 6 in this series of column experiments the natural sediment packed column is pre saturated with 330 15 μg l of as iii this is done to represent the more realistic groundwater condition where the porous media is expected to contain as contamination prior to injection of reagent for the in situ synthesis of fes then the fes in synthesized following the injection schedule of cases 4 5 and 6 as discussed earlier table 1 the as iii solution is passed through the porous media at a rate of 0 0056 0 0005 ml s under constant head condition the ph of the as iii solution is maintained at 7 9 0 1 the result fig 4 a suggests that the effluent concentration of as iii decreases significantly with respect to influent concentration for all the cases for example c c 0 is in the range of 0 21 0 42 0 21 to 0 53 and 0 24 to 0 41 within the pvs of 5 35 for case 4 case 5 and case 6 respectively where the c c 0 reaches a steady state plateau at c c 0 0 63 beyond 12 pvs for as iii when transported through unmodified porous media mass balance calculation indicates that up to 17 pvs 74 25 59 8 and 65 4 of injected as iii and at the end of 35 pvs 72 8 65 1 and 67 1 of injected as iii are immobilized in the fes containing porous media for the case 4 case 5 and case 6 respectively with respect to as iii retention case 4 shows the best performance in immobilizing as iii compared to that of case 5 and case 6 the mass balance calculation indicates that the as iii immobilization for most optimized case 72 9 removal has resulted in removal of 9 80 mg as g of fe for a duration of 35 pvs it is important to note that during the duration of 35 pvs not even 50 of injected as iii was eluted c c0 0 2 suggesting that the actual as removal capacity by the fes sand is much higher some of the studies have used different adsorbent in the column system shows as iii removal in a similar range as observed in this study for example doped activated carbon can adsorb 2 60 mg as g 3 30 mg as g of adsorbent sharma et al 2010 fe nanoparticle embedded polymer composites can remove 3 mg as g of adsorbent savina et al 2011 fe hydrotalcite supported magnetite nanoparticles can adsorb 0 121 mg as g adsorbent türk and alp 2014 feoh coated alumina can remove 7 65 mg as g of adsorbent hlavay and polyák 2005 in the packed column system han et al 2011 have reported that 45 mg as iii is removed per g of fes coated sand in the batch system at ph 5 however at ph 7 the as iii removal capacity is reduced to 11 mg as g of adsorbent they have also suggested that in the batch system the as iii removal capacity is always higher than that of the column system under constant flow condition overall the as iii removal capacity by in situ synthesized fes in the porous media used in this study is reasonably good and within the higher range of other reported studies immobilization of as iii in the porous media containing fe and s is likely to be attributed by the combined effect of chemical reaction co precipitation and sorption bhattacharya et al 2007 when the reagents such as feso4 and na2s are injected in the as iii pre saturated porous media the following additional reaction r2 and r3 might have taken place along with the reaction r1 as suggested by xie et al 2016 the formation of as2s3 and feass is expected which is likely to precipitate and sorbed on the retained fe surface in one of the studies gallegos et al 2008 have suggested that as iii fes interaction is controlled by the formation of realgar and some secondary products whereas han et al 2011 have suggested the removal of as iii by fes coated sand is dominated by the formation of orpiment at ph 5 and by adsorption at ph 9 r2 3s 2 3fe 2 2h3aso3 as2s3 3fe oh 2 r3 3s 2 3fe 2 h3aso3 fes2 feass 3fe oh 3 the fate of fe is also evaluated where the effluent concentration of fe is measured throughout the flow of as iii the result fig 4b suggests that at the initial stage immediately after injection of reagent a relatively high amount of fe has eluded the normalized effluent concentration c c 0 at the initial time around 3 pvs is 0 06 0 03 and 0 05 for case 4 case 5 and case 6 respectively however the effluent concentration reduces extensively towards the later stage and almost no fe is eluted beyond 15 pvs for case 4 and case 5 the mass balance calculation indicates that though during injection of reagents 93 5 case 4 100 case 5 and 86 6 case 6 of fe has retained in the porous media however along with as iii some amount of fe has eluded the result suggests in the case of 4 up to 58 9 up to 35 pvs of fe has retained which resulted in immobilization of 72 9 of as iii whereas in cases 5 and 6 retention of 58 3 and 58 9 of fe resulted in immobilization of 65 1 and 67 2 of as iii respectively the negligible amount of fe is observed at the outlet in the later stages suggesting that in the longer run fe concentration in water might not be a problem furthermore fe is ubiquitous in nature and a small amount of release of fe in dissolved form might not be a great concern from a toxicity point of view the results suggest that though the retained mass of fe within the porous media as fes is similar around 58 5 0 4 for all the three cases with different injection schedule however the as iii immobilization efficiency 72 9 is slightly high in the case of 4 compared to that of others case 5 and 6 case 6 shows the second best performance 67 2 with the injection of the same amount of fe 4 3 mg the duration of injection for case 4 1 5 pvs is half of that for case 6 3 pvs that suggests that the energy consumption related to injection would be less for case 4 compared to that of case 6 considering as iii immobilization efficiency and the injection duration case 4 is found to be the most optimal injection schedule that can immobilize a significant amount of as iii in the porous media by the in situ synthesis of fes 3 4 impact on porous media properties due to fes synthesis and arsenic immobilization in addition to the in situ synthesis of fes in the porous media and as iii immobilization the possible impact of the formation of fes and retention of as iii on the porous media property such as on porosity is also assessed the porosity of the natural sediment along the length of the packed column is measured at different stages following the protocol as mentioned earlier the result suggests that the porosity of the packed porous media along the length of the column is uniform 0 4 0 02 even after injection of reagents and formation of fes injected fe 4 33 mg no further change in porosity 0 4 0 02 is observed fig 5 the association and retention of as iii in the fes containing packed column does not influence the porosity 0 4 0 02 of the porous media throughout the column fig 5 furthermore the flow rate under the constant head condition has not changed after the injection of reagents and due to immobilization of as iii overall it could be said that the in situ formation of fes in the porous media and retention of as iii on the fes coating does not have any impact on the porous media properties such as porosity hydraulic conductivity and on the flow rate through the porous media overall the as iii removal by in situ synthesized fes is found to be significantly high under the controlled laboratory condition and the in situ as iii immobilization by fes does not have much implication on the porous media properties however it is important to note that the complex geochemistry in the natural groundwater system are likely to affect the as iii removal efficiency differently bhattacharya et al 2004 2007 sracek et al 2004 vega et al 2017 ahmad and bhattacharya 2019 which can be explored in the future study 4 conclusion in this study the optimal schedule for in situ synthesis of fes within the natural sand packed porous media and its performance in immobilizing as iii is assessed overall the results indicate that fes can be effectively synthesized in situ in the porous media and a very high percentage of fe 90 can be retained in the long term when the porous media is not pre saturated with as iii the immobilization of as iii is also very high 80 up to 17 pvs in those cases in a more realistic condition where the porous media is pre saturated with as iii the optimal fes synthesis scheme is identified case 4 amongst the tried scenarios injection of highly concentrated 20 mm reagents i e feso4 and na2s for 1 5 pvs shows the optimal result for immobilization of as iii 72 retained up to 35 pvs in this case though a relatively high amount of fe has mobilized along with as iii at the initial stage but at the later stage no fe is detected at the outlet and almost 60 of fe is retained within the porous media overall it could be concluded that fes is synthesized efficiently within the porous media which can immobilize as iii significantly in the anoxic condition furthermore the formation of fes and immobilization of as iii does not alter the porous media properties or the flow condition thus it could be stated that the technique has the potential to apply in the real field condition for mitigating arsenic contamination in situ however it can also be noted that the presence of co ions and different flow conditions might affect the as iii uptake efficiency by synthesized fes under natural groundwater condition for example the presence of silicate sulfate etc may reduce the performance of as iii removal depending on ph furthermore ferrous ion might present in the natural groundwater which may involve in reaction with injected na2s and can form fes that might reduce the required amount of feso4 inject in this study a moderate groundwater flow rate is adopted a lower groundwater flow rate than that adopted in the experiment can result in higher contact time between the deposited fes and the flowing as iii which can enhance as iii removal efficiency in the natural system under groundwater condition the as iii uptake mechanism would be very complex in nature and will be studied in the real field scenario as a future scope

12187,the study examines households willingness to pay for fluoride safe water service connection in the rift valley region of ethiopia the open ended contingent valuation elicitation survey was used to estimate the values of fluoride safe water service connection fswsc at home and at the nearest public tap using an ordinary least square method the estimated willingness to pay wtp for 2 m3 of fluoride safe water consumption connected at home is valued at usd 13 70 and that at the nearest public tap is valued at usd 6 84 per month considering the censored tobit model the estimated wtp for 2 m3 of fswsc at home is valued at usd 13 45 and that at the nearest public tap at usd 6 54 per month the income share of households wtp for fluoride safe water service consumption per month ranges from 8 percent to 16 percent in addition the benefit cost ratio analysis for the fswsc to a nearest public tap and at home is 5 31 and 10 93 respectively showing that fluoride safe water supply is economically feasible factors such as perceptions about the quality of water degree of dissatisfaction with available water service education level of households ownership of the house and the number of children less than 5 years of age are found to have positive significant influence on households wtp on the contrary age of the respondents water bill gender being male and location of the participant those in adama and lume reveals negative significant influences on households wtp the overall policy implications are that government needs to mobilize fund from the residents invite the private sector or operate with public private partnership mode and install community based fluoride safe public taps at large to bridge the unmet fluoride safe water demand gap keywords safe drinking water ordinary least square tobit model rift valley region 1 introduction although the provision of tap water may be increasing worldwide access to safe water connection is still challenging in developing countries worldwide hundreds of millions of people depend on polluted drinking water by geo genic contaminants such as fluoride arsenic and other minerals huber a c et al 2013 in the rift valley region of ethiopia about 14 million people are vulnerable to widespread fluorosis that is resulting from an excessive fluoride uptake through drinking water tekle haimanot et al 2006 according to neha et al 2016 fluoride first spread from iran and iraq via syria and turkey to the mediterranean region it then spread from algeria to morocco and later through the east african rift valley to countries like ethiopia kenya uganda and tanzania because of volcanic activity however the intensity and prevalence of the fluoride problem is severe in ethiopia rango et al 2012 for instance the fluoride concentration level in some of the rift valley lakes which people directly rely on for domestic purposes is summarized in table 1 below although the world health organization who has restricted the maximum fluoride concentration suitable for safe drinking water to be 1 5mgl neha et al 2016 in reality people are exposed to an excess fluoride contaminated water for domestic purposes in developing countries particularly in the rift valley region of ethiopia because of this the residents are vulnerable to dental and skeletal fluorosis such as decay of teeth joint pain and crippling of bones and to social and psychological problems such as exclusion and rejection world health organization 2015 tekle haimanot et al 2006 unluckily it has been found that the medical treatment of dental and skeletal fluorosis is mostly ineffective and difficult especially when the condition has reached a critical stage tekle haimanot et al 2006 for this reason it is crucial to prevent high fluoride consumption by looking for alternative sources of safe water services however collecting water from alternative sources is more costly and less efficient than collectively provided tap water system whittington et al 1990 for instance water treatment at home that is fluoride removal is not cost effective at household level as compared to collectively provided tap water whittington et al 1990 furthermore poor households are less able to afford and undertake adequate private investment in water infrastructure fluoride removal technologies and storage facilities lack of information on household s willingness to pay to secure fluoride safe water service connection is an important obstacle to the implementation of public provision of fluoride safe drinking water this is because of the fact that there are no studies that have exclusively investigated households willingness to pay for fluoride safe water service connection in the rift valley region of ethiopia this may not be surprising as there are very few studies that have been conducted in the fluoride distribution belt countries across the world a study by gonzalez davila 2013 deals with the willingness to pay for arsenic safe and fluoride safe water service connection in mexico city according to the result of the study households were willing to pay usd 2 7 for fluoride removal and usd 3 2 for arsenic removal per month jonson et al 2003 did a study in sri lanka focusing on un packaging demand for water service quality using stated preference data along with a survey of 1800 respondents in three towns negombo kalutara and galle an insightful finding of the study is that economically poor households do not necessarily prefer home taps to public taps or mini grids because of high connection costs there are also studies on wtp for quality of water service improvement using contingent valuation methods across the globe and a few of them are summarized in table 2 below in addition to the above studies there are also studies conducted in ethiopia with regard to estimating wtp for quality of water services in general context some of the studies and the estimated mean wtp are summarized in table 3 according to table 3 the willingness to pay for quality of water service in general varies from place to places however there is no even a single study that has been investigated households willingness to pay for fluoride safe water service connection in the rift valley region of ethiopia therefore the objective of this study is to investigate the value that the households in the region place on fluoride safe water service connection using contingent valuation methods accordingly the study aims to 1 estimate households wtp for fluoride safe water connected at home and at the nearest public tap 2 conduct a cost benefit analysis of fluoride safe water supply in the study area and 3 compare estimated wtp measures using different estimation techniques after this introductory section the rest of the study is organized as follows section two is a methodological part that includes theoretical foundation of the model survey design and elicitation methods sampling and sample size and model estimation methods section three of the study will present results and discussions the last section section four encompasses conclusions implications suggestions for future study 2 methodological approach 2 1 theoretical methods the expenditure or indirect utility function provides the theoretical structure for welfare estimation welfare measures such as ideas of compensating and equivalent variation and the willingness to pay and willingness to accept are directly derived from the area under the demand curve the marshallian and hicksian demand curve according to the water resource management policy 1 1 https www slb com services additional water resources policy aspx water is both a social and an economic good on the one hand everybody has the right to get clean water at affordable prices and on the other hand water supply and sewerage services should generate enough funds to cover their costs for sustainability and for further expansion into new areas therefore considering clean water supply as a quasi public good in the sense that everybody has the right to access clean water but may not necessarily have a connection at home the value of a quasi public good can be measured by the total benefit derived by every individual to whom the good service is provided the benefit is estimated using the net change in households income that is equivalent to the change in quality of water services this study deals with the valuation of fluoride safe water service provision to the rift valley residents in ethiopia and hence the study considered a change in the quality of water to calculate the benefit derived from this quality improvement accordingly suppose an individual chooses w i volume of water to fetch from a tap and then the public determines the quality level of the water q j w is supposed to be available at prices p 1 p 2 p n p which may or may not be determined by the market a household maximizes its utility subject to income y the indirect utility function is given as 1 1 v p q y max w u w q p w y haab mcconnell 2003 using the dual of indirect utility function which is expenditure minimization function m p q u 1 2 m p q u min p w u w q u suppose the quality of water supply has increased from its current status to a fluoride safe level of water services q to measure how much the households value fluoride safe water in the rift valley region we have used consumer wtp based welfare measures using an open ended contingent valuation based hypothetical scenario elicitation method for a household willingness to pay is the amount of income that compensates for or equivalent to an increase in the quality of water supply 1 3 v p q y w t p v p q y when q q and an increase in q is desirable v q i 0 by the same fashion we can define wtp with the expenditure function haab and mcconnell 2003 1 4 w t p m p q u m p q u w h e n u v p q y willingness to pay for improved water quality is simply the difference between two expenditure functions with q q from the hiksian demand function w i u p q u m p p q u we estimate the willingness to pay for access to w i changes when the water qualities change if the water quality improves from q to q individual willingness to pay for access to fluoride safe water is 1 5 w t p f l u o r i d e s a f e p p w 1 u p q u d p p p w 1 u p q u d p equation 1 6 shows the change in the area under the hiksian demand curve for quality changes from q to q and price changes from current p to choke price p 2 2 choke price is the minimum price at which the quantity demanded of a good is equal to zero at any price below the choke price consumers will demand some quantity of the good since such demand functions are derivatives of the expenditure function with respect to price putting into integral we can express the changes as 1 6 w t p f l u o r i d e s a f e m p q u m p q u m p q u m p q u weak complementarity implies that at choke price p or higher an increase in quality does not shift the expenditure function and hence m p q u m p q u rearranging equation 1 6 the wtp for access to fluoride safe water service is 1 7 w t p f l u o r i d e s a f e p p w 1 u p q u d p p p w 1 u p q u d p m p q u m p q u this estimates the compensating surplus measure for water quality connection at home and at the nearest public tap in other words it is the additional charges that each consumer is wtp and remains at the utility level before the change using whittington et al 1990 and whittington 2002 specification we estimate wtp using a multivariate regression analysis because willingness to pay varies across households based on demographic characteristics economic characteristics and the perceived attitudes towards quality of water services that can be denoted by x i in the expenditure function hence in general the wtp for an improved fluoride safe water connection is 1 8 w t p q m p q u 0 x i m p q u 0 x i in general income compensating functions willig 1976 could serve as a theoretical model for explaining households willingness to pay model considering willingness to pay as a welfare measure the income compensating function which includes arguments about the vector of respondents characteristics can be referred to as the willingness to pay function kwak and russell 1994 2 2 survey design and elicitation form the study used contingent valuation based survey questionnaire for investigating fluoride safe water service connection at home and at the nearest public tap the elicitation format was an open ended question format framed as follows q1 suppose the local government wants to invest in water quality fluoride level and water supply infrastructure to be able to provide quality drinkable water from the tap to your home for 24 h a day however without collecting sufficient water fees from households like yours it is difficult to maintain the sustainability of water supply hence what is the maximum amount of usd that you will pay per jerican 20 l water container for such a fluoride safe water supply connection in addition to your current bill q2 suppose the local government wants to invest in water quality fluoride level and water supply infrastructure at the community public tap that will be installed in your village close to your home 5 min walk for a two way trip to ensure everybody has access to fluoride safe drinking water that is available for 24 h however without collecting sufficient water fees from households like yours it is difficult to maintain the sustainability of the water supply hence what is the maximum amount of usd you will pay per jerican 20 l water container for such community fluoride safe water supply in addition to your current bill the open ended contingent valuation survey is more efficient than a single dichotomous yes no choice survey as a closed ended question would be would you be willing to pay usd m and this holds very less relevant information than a response to an open ended question like how much are you willing to pay haab and mcconnell 2003 however an open ended contingent valuation method cvm question format may also lead to overestimation or underestimation of wtp for the goods being valued unless given more attention to reduce the bias armbrecht 2014 nunes and nijkamp 2011 to reduce this bias the study used the contingent valuation questions at the last part of the survey section after respondents are aware of the topic and content of the questionnaire 2 3 sampling and sample size the study conducted multi stage sampling in such a way that the study area was first identified as the rift valley region where there are problems of excess fluoride with low water service supply in the second stage the zone and woredas were purposively selected guided by the regional water supply office s expert in identifying areas with excess fluoride then five woredas were selected and in each woreda the water supply office assisted the researcher in identifying specific kebeles with excess fluoride and water supply problems finally a list of households was obtained from each selected kebele and respondents were identified using systematic random sampling the sampling design is summarized below table 4 for the sake of reliability of the data the survey was conducted through personal interview 2 4 estimation method the economic valuation method applied is contingent valuation cv a social survey method where individuals are presented with information about a specific environmental change water quality improvement in this context the values of which are not accounted for in economic markets or captured through market based instruments the dependent variable for the model is wtp which is continuous data but censored at zero values less than zero or equal to zero are transformed to single value zero for people who have zero wtp or are not wtp for improvements in water services in the statistical context censoring means that the distribution of the underlined variable wtp may not be observed entirely and the unobservable portion of the distribution will be massed to a single value zero in this case the ols coefficient s estimates will not be consistent and the wtp will be overestimated kwak and russell 1994 to overcome this inconsistency the tobit model proposed by james tobin 1958 and amemiya 1984 is the best method which estimates parameter values using the maximum likelihood method mle therefore we applied tobit censored econometrics that is fitting in cases where the wtp dependent variable has continuous positive and non zero values rodríguez tapia et al 2017 wooldridge 2015 suppose the wtp for improved quality of water services for household i in the population is given by 1 9 wtp f z i q i ε i where z i a vector of household covariates qi is water quality characteristics and ε i is an error term that captures specification or measurement errors since there are people who have no wtp for improved water services in the survey sample to consider this reality the dependent variable is censored at zero and modelled as 1 10 wtp f z i q i ε i f o r w t p 0 w t p 0 f o r w t p 0 based on this behavioral model for a unit of the population the parameter for the function of f z i q i and the distribution of ε i is modelled as suppose h ε i is the likelihood density function for ε i and the density for wtp for household with positive wtp for water service improvements which is denoted by h wtp i wtp i 0 is stated as a conditional probability of observing wtpi provided wtp is greater than zero 1 11 h wtp i wtp i 0 h w t p i f z i q i p r f z i q i ε i 0 the denominator controls the density function for positive wtp to consider truncation by not observing zero wtp the possibility of observing a household with zero wtp is p r f z i q i ε i 0 accordingly the study constructed the ith contribution to the probability function as the multiplication of the probability that wtp is equal to zero and the probability that wtp is positive times the density of the positive wtp haab and mcconnell 2003 1 12 p r f z i q i ε i 0 1 i i p r f z i q i ε i 0 h w t p i f z i q i p r f z i q i ε i 0 where i i 1 when wtp is positive and 0 when wtp is zero to make the estimation using the tobit model we need to make assumptions about functional form f z i q i and the distribution of ε i h ε i let f z i q i z i β and ε i n 0 δ 2 the tobit likelihood function is 1 13 l β δ wtp z i 1 t 1 φ z i β δ 1 i i 1 δ φ w t p i z i β δ i i where after rearrangement p r f z i q i ε i 0 1 φ z i β δ the log likelihood function for the tobit model is 1 14 ln l β δ wtp z i 1 t 1 i i ln 1 φ z i β δ i i ln φ w t p i z i β δ ln δ the difference between the tobit model and ordinary least square ols model is shown by noting that the tobit model has an extra term i 1 t 1 i i ln 1 φ z i β δ from equation 1 14 accordingly using the individual covariates the tobit model for wtp for improved quality of water services at home and at nearest public tap is modelled as 1 15 w t p α 0 α 1 q u a t t α 2 i n f a t t α 3 d i s s a t t α 4 s r c e w α 5 b o t l α 6 o w n h o u s e α 7 n c h l 5 y r α 8 a g e α 9 i n c o m

results and discussions 3 1 descriptive results the households average income per month is estimated to be 2260 etb ethiopian birr 83 usd the livelihood of rural households in ethiopia depends on the assets they have such as livestock size and farming income rather than a monthly income the average family size was six persons per household regarding their occupation the majority of the respondents are farmers followed by those who run their own business the source of water supply for most of the respondents is a public tap 32 4 percent followed by open sources including lakes rivers springs and public bore holes 21 2 percent for those who get water from the pipeline the frequency of water service disconnections is three times per month on average 60 8 percent although this varies from woreda to woreda once the service is disconnected the outages last for more than 24 h according to most of the respondents 43 5 percent there is no official time schedule when the service is disconnected neither there is prior notification about service interruption table 5 regarding the alternative water consumption the average money expenditure on drinking bottled and other clean water source was about 99 40 etb usd 3 62 per month per household compared to their total water bills per month and their total income per month the amount of money spent on getting safe water services was 87 percent and 4 percent for bottled and other clean water respectively this is a significant expenditure compared to their monthly earnings and it implies the existence of a serious water supply problem in the area under investigation in addition households are willing to travel for about a quarter of an hour on average to get better quality water by trading off an opportunity cost of their time the current water expenditure accounts for nearly 5 percent of the monthly income of the respondents as estimated using the kernel density estimates as shown in fig 1 the willingness to pay for fswsc varies across gender fig 2 assuming other things are constant the result shows that females have more willingness to pay than their male counterparts do furthermore the impact of gender age and other socioeconomic and demographic variables are included in the next econometrics section 3 2 estimation results the ordinary least square ols and the tobit model are estimated and the results are summarized below table 6 it is estimated that the wtp for a fluoride safe drinking water connection is etb 3 69 usd 0 13 cents per jerican at home with 24 h availability accordingly a household that consumes 2 m3 of fluoride safe water per month will pay usd 13 45 etb 370 to compare this result with some previous studies rodríguez tapia et al 2017 estimated a total wtp for quality of water supply in mexico city to be usd 3 10 per home bi monthly while gonzález davila o 2013 estimated a households wtp for fluoride safe and arsenic safe water in mexico to be usd 2 7 and 3 2 per month respectively the results of the estimated model show that perceptions about fluoride levels prior information notification services and overall dissatisfaction rate positively influenced households wtp for fluoride safe drinking water connections all of the perception variables are statistically significant in influencing households decision to pay in addition to the factors of perception the source of water supply has a strong influence on the respondents wtp for instance households whose water source is through pipelines are less willing to pay for the improved quality of water services perhaps perceiving that there is no significant difference in the quality of the water as compared to those who depend on open sources of water since the majority of the people in the study area are not connected to pipelines at home and mainly obtain water from open source like lakes rivers and bore holes private and common and rarely from public taps they have more willingness to pay compared to those who already have a connection at home purchasing bottled water increases wtp by etb 0 001 usd 0 00004 and an increase in income increases wtp by etb 0 158 usd 0 006 another high impact social variable is the number of children less than 5 years in the family and whether the households have own house or not as a household has usually more than one child in the family its additional wtp for fluoride safe drinking water per jerican is 0 058 etb usd 0 002 likewise as a household owns a house wtp for fluoride safe water service connection increases by 0 287 etb usd 0 01 among the demographic variables age of the respondents male dominated family headship and family size have a negative impact on households willingness to pay for fluoride safe drinking water at home the implications of these are that older people are less educated in the ethiopian context and more resistance for changes and less value for fluoride safe water as a matter of culture females are responsible for fetching water and taking care of household activities so they value quality of water more than males do the impact of family size on households willingness to pay for fluoride safe water is insignificant in both models another important variable is education of household head which has a positive influence on households wtp for fluoride safe water service by considering the education variable as a dummy those who have attended formal schooling are more willing to pay for fluoride safe water than those who do not have any formal schooling assuming other things are constant this implies that educated households have more awareness about the impact of fluoride on health and hence value their own and their families health more than the illiterate households concerning with the present water related variables the monthly water bill had a negative impact on wtp for quality of water while the volume of water consumption had a positive impact on households wtp for quality water because households income is limited a higher current bill will lead to less wtp for fluoride safe water supply whereas the more the volume of water consumed by households the more wtp for fluoride safe water these results are consistent with findings of rodríguez tapia et al 2017 in mexico location which was categorized based on fluoride concentration level shows that the respondents from adama and lume had negative wtp for fluoride safe water as compared to those from bora and zuway dugda woredas these results make sense as far as the location is concerned since bora and zuway dugda have higher fluoride concentration level and more severely affected victims of fluoride consumption hence the residents in these woredas are more wtp for safe water than their counterparts in the other woredas considered in this study the second model is the willingness to pay for fluoride safe water service connection to the nearest public taps accordingly the ols and censored tobit estimated results are summarized in table 7 the estimated wtp for fluoride safe water per jerican from the nearest public tap is etb 1 80 usd 0 065 cents for households who consume 6 jericans per week or 24 jericans per month for drinking and cooking from the nearest public tab the estimated wtp is etb 43 20 usd 1 6 and the households who consume 2m3 per month have a wtp of etb 180 usd 6 55 this estimated figure is quite reasonable and affordable compared to the current private vendor water bills and other opportunity costs many socioeconomic and demographic variables included in this model have almost a similar effect with the first model about connection to fluoride safe water service at home except the magnitudes and signs of few variables for instance perceptions of prior notification about the water service are insignificant in influencing a households wtp for fluoride safe water and variables such as own house income family size and volume of water consumption are insignificant in influencing households wtp for fluoride safe water connected to the nearest public tap per jerican with regard to income effect the results show that people with higher incomes do not necessarily have more wtp for public tap connections instead it is the poor households who prefer this source of water this result is similar to jonson et al 2003 study in sri lanka where the poor households did not necessarily prefer private taps to public and mini grid lines for water this study shows that households who get water from sources other than a pipeline have more wtp for improved water as compared to families whose source is pipelines see fig 2 3 3 comparison of wtp results by distance to sources assuming a given household consumes 2m3 of fluoride safe water per month for drinking cooking and washing that it gets either at home or from nearest public tap the estimated mean wtp using the open ended cvm methods is quite comparable consumers who willing to have pipeline connection at home have slightly higher wtp for quality water than those who willing to rely on the nearest public tap connection the mean willingness to pay for fluoride safe water connected at home is etb 370 usd 13 45 per month and that of wtp for the nearest public tap safe water is etb 180 usd 6 55 per month comparisons of the mean willingness to pay is presented in fig 3 3 4 cost benefit analysis from 2002 to 2010 the government of ethiopia invested etb 276 3 million usd 2 1 million for water supply projects in five woredas in the rift valley region which is adjacent to this study area datturi et al 2015 it was aimed that the water supply would cover about 827 000 residents in the area which is almost the same as the population in the woredas targeted by this study 831 000 population csa 2013 in addition to the usd 2 1 million initial investment which includes cost of developing water sources bone char and all costs incurred in the setting up of the entire scheme such as water tanks pipe lines kiosks and water storage the estimated operational cost for a 20 year life span of the water supply scheme is calculated to be etb 25 3 million usd 1 95 million datturi et al 2015 the estimated yearly operational costs include maintenance electricity chemicals water caretakers salary and other miscellaneous expenses water was provided to the community after treatment of fluorides in community based water taps considering the total investment and operational costs per m3 of that project as a proxy cost for our study and adding the current inflation rate for calculating the total cost we can calculate the cost benefit analysis therefore if we calculate the total mean willingness to pay for the all households in the five woredas using the estimated monthly wtp of each household fig 3 and by comparing it with the initial investment and operation costs we can verify the potential cost benefit analysis and estimate its potential for consumers in getting fluoride safe water hence we considered the aggregate mean wtp of all households living in the sampled woredas for this fluoride safe water supply project for a period of 20 years as the benefit of such a service in the benefit cost analysis estimation the total mean willingness to pay for fswsc by considering a yearly present value of mean wtp for up to 20 years using a seven percent annual discount rate 3 3 the national bank of ethiopia base money rate in april 2018 was used as an annual discount rate is given as woo et al 2017 1 16 t o t a l mwtp a l l h h t 1 20 a n u a l m w t p a l l h h y e a r 1 0 07 t 1 where the annual average wtp of all households is the product of individual average wtp estimated by each model results times the number of households in the five woredas csa 2013 times 12 months the estimated results are given in table 8 it is estimated that the total investments and operational costs for the fluoride safe water supply project scheme was etb 301 5 million usd 23 2 million datturi et al 2015 as we have calculated the total lifetime average wtp for fluoride safe water by cvm methods table 8 this is larger than the total cost of the project therefore compared to the investments and operational costs the supply of fluoride safe drinking water in the rift valley region is economically feasible since the residents willingness to pay is sufficient to recover the investment and operational costs given other things are constant the estimated aggregate present value of mean wtp for a fluoride safe water connection at home is about usd 253 5 million and for connection at the nearest public tap is about usd 123 3 million all these values are greater than the total cost of the clean water supply project assumed usd 23 2 million the estimated value of wtp may be overestimated since consumers are valuing the quality of water services hypothetically for instance according to datturi et al 2015 the treated water tariff per meter cube in the adjacent woreda was etb 22 usd 0 8 cents whereas the stated willingness to pay for 1 m cube of fluoride safe water is about etb 90 usd 3 3 this huge difference can be attributed to different factors including strategic or response bias therefore the results imply that there is huge potential willingness to pay if people are provided fluoride safe water services in the study area fig 4 below shows the benefit cost ratio of fluoride safe water service connection in million usd to sum up it is possible to provide fluoride safe drinking water to rift valley s residents who are suffering from skeletal and dental fluorosis provided that there is commitment from the woreda regional water supply office as explained in the cost benefit analysis there is huge potential wtp for safe water if the providers strategically design the payment mechanism and scheme through installments instead of one time payment to overcome the financial constraints the income share of households wtp for fluoride safe water per month ranges from 8 percent to 16 percent in addition this result is comparable to the findings of other studies such as vásquez et al 2009 in mexico which shows that households median wtp for safe and drinkable water was greater than their current water bill at least by 45 6 percent and greater than 5 7 percent of the customers median income gunatilake 2012 shows that households are willing to pay 3 6 percent of their incomes for water service improvement and rodríguez tapia et al 2017 shows that consumers were willing to pay 0 22 percent of their income for quality of water services in mexico city hensher et al 2005 shows that households are willing to pay 19 percent of their annual bills to receive prior notifications about water service interruptions and lee 2014 estimated that households wtp at about 18 2 percent of the current bill rate per cubic water consumption in ulsan city in south korea gonzález davila 2013 shows that households wtp for fluoride and arsenic removal was usd 2 7 and 3 22 per month respectively in mexico 4 conclusion and policy implications clean water supply is still a luxury item in the rural areas of developing country in our study area rural households are suffering from a problem of excess fluoride concentration in the drinking water considering this problem the study has conducted households willingness to pay for fluoride safe water service connections at two different sources using an ordinary least square mothed this study reveals that the estimated wtp for 2m3 of fluoride safe water consumption connected at home and at the nearest public tap are usd 13 70 and usd 6 84 per month respectively in addition using the censored tobit model the estimated wtp for 2m3 of fswsc at home and at the nearest public tap are usd 13 45 and usd 6 54 per month respectively considering households only as a source of funds it is possible to provide fluoride safe water services from the financial perspective to the rift valley residents since the aggregated present value of total wtp is greater than the total cost of fluoride safe water supply project over the life span of 20 years that means the provision of fluoride safe water supply is financially feasible in the study area given other things are constant furthermore in addition to estimating mean wtp other factors which influence households wtp such as perceptions about the quality of water degree of dissatisfaction education own house and number of children less than 5 years were also explored all of which having a positive influence on households wtp age of respondents water bill the male gender and location of the respondents those in adama and lume had a negative influence on households willingness to pay for fluoride safe drinking water bottled water is 1150 times more expensive than the current woreda water tariffs and 200 times more expensive than the current stated household willingness to pay for 2m3 of fluoride safe water 4 4 2 l of bottled water cost etb 15 usd 0 55 and 2000 l cost etb 15 000 usd 545 in january 2018 this shows that households will be glad to be connected to an improved public pipeline water service since it is less costly than adopting alternative forms of water purification methods some of the policy implications are that the government water provider needs to mobilize funds from households and from other donor agents including the world bank in addition to other stakeholders households are willing to pay a significant amount of money if they are provided with fluoride safe water services the government needs to invite private providers in the water supply sector the private sector can easily be attracted because fluoride safe water supply is economically feasible according to the cost benefit analysis result for instance countries like england and chile have fully privatized the water sector and france usa cote d ivore south africa malaysia colombia poland and mexico have partially privatized the sector with mixed ownership marin 2009 by establishing strict regulations inviting private water providers could be an alternative to enhance fluoride safe water supply coverage creating public private partnerships for service delivery is another viable option for the government the government can still have the ownership and can outsource some service delivery for some duration of time public private partnerships are common forms in which the private sector can participate in the water supply sector marin 2009 for instance in kenya the local water utility created a public private partnership with those who have private bore holes in the community by transferring them to networks of water kiosks in the community njeru and alukwe 2014 the local public water supply company invested in rehabilitating and equipping the fragmented private bore holes constructing storage pipeline distribution and a network of water kiosks this can be a good lesson for ethiopia since both countries share similar situations with regard to the fluoride problem in this way the local government in the rift valley region at kebele level can also intervene and supply reliable and affordable water services through a network of water kiosks and community taps besides creating employment for kiosk operators and reducing school dropout rates because of inadequate water vending or time spent in water collecting or water borne diseases thereby increasing the overall social welfare creating public private partnerships is a typical solution which is mostly overlooked by local governments the government needs to install community based fluoride safe public taps according to the wtp analysis for the nearest public tap fluoride safe water service connection households particularly the relatively poorer ones have wtp for it since they believe that they cannot afford to pay for the connection fee at home and instead would like to pay more for safe water services from the nearest public tap hence the government should provide community based fluoride safe water public taps as a good intervention that can be used for tackling the problem of lack of clean water supply at least in the short run although the study has insightful policy implications in the fluoride victim region it has its own limitations from methodological point of view the open ended contingent valuation survey may have its own drawbacks although it provides a simple direct valuation of fluoride safe water services the respondents may not have a frame of reference to respond accurately because consumers value attributes of the goods more than the goods per se as a result the wtp data may be subject to overestimation or underestimation compared to other double bounded dichotomous choice formats bennett and blamey 2001 hence the study suggests future researchers to consider better elicitation formats declaration of competing interest the authors would like to disclose that there is no conflict of interest acknowledgements the authors would like to thank international it policy program itpp at seoul national university and adama science and technology university for the financial support provided to this research work 
12187,the study examines households willingness to pay for fluoride safe water service connection in the rift valley region of ethiopia the open ended contingent valuation elicitation survey was used to estimate the values of fluoride safe water service connection fswsc at home and at the nearest public tap using an ordinary least square method the estimated willingness to pay wtp for 2 m3 of fluoride safe water consumption connected at home is valued at usd 13 70 and that at the nearest public tap is valued at usd 6 84 per month considering the censored tobit model the estimated wtp for 2 m3 of fswsc at home is valued at usd 13 45 and that at the nearest public tap at usd 6 54 per month the income share of households wtp for fluoride safe water service consumption per month ranges from 8 percent to 16 percent in addition the benefit cost ratio analysis for the fswsc to a nearest public tap and at home is 5 31 and 10 93 respectively showing that fluoride safe water supply is economically feasible factors such as perceptions about the quality of water degree of dissatisfaction with available water service education level of households ownership of the house and the number of children less than 5 years of age are found to have positive significant influence on households wtp on the contrary age of the respondents water bill gender being male and location of the participant those in adama and lume reveals negative significant influences on households wtp the overall policy implications are that government needs to mobilize fund from the residents invite the private sector or operate with public private partnership mode and install community based fluoride safe public taps at large to bridge the unmet fluoride safe water demand gap keywords safe drinking water ordinary least square tobit model rift valley region 1 introduction although the provision of tap water may be increasing worldwide access to safe water connection is still challenging in developing countries worldwide hundreds of millions of people depend on polluted drinking water by geo genic contaminants such as fluoride arsenic and other minerals huber a c et al 2013 in the rift valley region of ethiopia about 14 million people are vulnerable to widespread fluorosis that is resulting from an excessive fluoride uptake through drinking water tekle haimanot et al 2006 according to neha et al 2016 fluoride first spread from iran and iraq via syria and turkey to the mediterranean region it then spread from algeria to morocco and later through the east african rift valley to countries like ethiopia kenya uganda and tanzania because of volcanic activity however the intensity and prevalence of the fluoride problem is severe in ethiopia rango et al 2012 for instance the fluoride concentration level in some of the rift valley lakes which people directly rely on for domestic purposes is summarized in table 1 below although the world health organization who has restricted the maximum fluoride concentration suitable for safe drinking water to be 1 5mgl neha et al 2016 in reality people are exposed to an excess fluoride contaminated water for domestic purposes in developing countries particularly in the rift valley region of ethiopia because of this the residents are vulnerable to dental and skeletal fluorosis such as decay of teeth joint pain and crippling of bones and to social and psychological problems such as exclusion and rejection world health organization 2015 tekle haimanot et al 2006 unluckily it has been found that the medical treatment of dental and skeletal fluorosis is mostly ineffective and difficult especially when the condition has reached a critical stage tekle haimanot et al 2006 for this reason it is crucial to prevent high fluoride consumption by looking for alternative sources of safe water services however collecting water from alternative sources is more costly and less efficient than collectively provided tap water system whittington et al 1990 for instance water treatment at home that is fluoride removal is not cost effective at household level as compared to collectively provided tap water whittington et al 1990 furthermore poor households are less able to afford and undertake adequate private investment in water infrastructure fluoride removal technologies and storage facilities lack of information on household s willingness to pay to secure fluoride safe water service connection is an important obstacle to the implementation of public provision of fluoride safe drinking water this is because of the fact that there are no studies that have exclusively investigated households willingness to pay for fluoride safe water service connection in the rift valley region of ethiopia this may not be surprising as there are very few studies that have been conducted in the fluoride distribution belt countries across the world a study by gonzalez davila 2013 deals with the willingness to pay for arsenic safe and fluoride safe water service connection in mexico city according to the result of the study households were willing to pay usd 2 7 for fluoride removal and usd 3 2 for arsenic removal per month jonson et al 2003 did a study in sri lanka focusing on un packaging demand for water service quality using stated preference data along with a survey of 1800 respondents in three towns negombo kalutara and galle an insightful finding of the study is that economically poor households do not necessarily prefer home taps to public taps or mini grids because of high connection costs there are also studies on wtp for quality of water service improvement using contingent valuation methods across the globe and a few of them are summarized in table 2 below in addition to the above studies there are also studies conducted in ethiopia with regard to estimating wtp for quality of water services in general context some of the studies and the estimated mean wtp are summarized in table 3 according to table 3 the willingness to pay for quality of water service in general varies from place to places however there is no even a single study that has been investigated households willingness to pay for fluoride safe water service connection in the rift valley region of ethiopia therefore the objective of this study is to investigate the value that the households in the region place on fluoride safe water service connection using contingent valuation methods accordingly the study aims to 1 estimate households wtp for fluoride safe water connected at home and at the nearest public tap 2 conduct a cost benefit analysis of fluoride safe water supply in the study area and 3 compare estimated wtp measures using different estimation techniques after this introductory section the rest of the study is organized as follows section two is a methodological part that includes theoretical foundation of the model survey design and elicitation methods sampling and sample size and model estimation methods section three of the study will present results and discussions the last section section four encompasses conclusions implications suggestions for future study 2 methodological approach 2 1 theoretical methods the expenditure or indirect utility function provides the theoretical structure for welfare estimation welfare measures such as ideas of compensating and equivalent variation and the willingness to pay and willingness to accept are directly derived from the area under the demand curve the marshallian and hicksian demand curve according to the water resource management policy 1 1 https www slb com services additional water resources policy aspx water is both a social and an economic good on the one hand everybody has the right to get clean water at affordable prices and on the other hand water supply and sewerage services should generate enough funds to cover their costs for sustainability and for further expansion into new areas therefore considering clean water supply as a quasi public good in the sense that everybody has the right to access clean water but may not necessarily have a connection at home the value of a quasi public good can be measured by the total benefit derived by every individual to whom the good service is provided the benefit is estimated using the net change in households income that is equivalent to the change in quality of water services this study deals with the valuation of fluoride safe water service provision to the rift valley residents in ethiopia and hence the study considered a change in the quality of water to calculate the benefit derived from this quality improvement accordingly suppose an individual chooses w i volume of water to fetch from a tap and then the public determines the quality level of the water q j w is supposed to be available at prices p 1 p 2 p n p which may or may not be determined by the market a household maximizes its utility subject to income y the indirect utility function is given as 1 1 v p q y max w u w q p w y haab mcconnell 2003 using the dual of indirect utility function which is expenditure minimization function m p q u 1 2 m p q u min p w u w q u suppose the quality of water supply has increased from its current status to a fluoride safe level of water services q to measure how much the households value fluoride safe water in the rift valley region we have used consumer wtp based welfare measures using an open ended contingent valuation based hypothetical scenario elicitation method for a household willingness to pay is the amount of income that compensates for or equivalent to an increase in the quality of water supply 1 3 v p q y w t p v p q y when q q and an increase in q is desirable v q i 0 by the same fashion we can define wtp with the expenditure function haab and mcconnell 2003 1 4 w t p m p q u m p q u w h e n u v p q y willingness to pay for improved water quality is simply the difference between two expenditure functions with q q from the hiksian demand function w i u p q u m p p q u we estimate the willingness to pay for access to w i changes when the water qualities change if the water quality improves from q to q individual willingness to pay for access to fluoride safe water is 1 5 w t p f l u o r i d e s a f e p p w 1 u p q u d p p p w 1 u p q u d p equation 1 6 shows the change in the area under the hiksian demand curve for quality changes from q to q and price changes from current p to choke price p 2 2 choke price is the minimum price at which the quantity demanded of a good is equal to zero at any price below the choke price consumers will demand some quantity of the good since such demand functions are derivatives of the expenditure function with respect to price putting into integral we can express the changes as 1 6 w t p f l u o r i d e s a f e m p q u m p q u m p q u m p q u weak complementarity implies that at choke price p or higher an increase in quality does not shift the expenditure function and hence m p q u m p q u rearranging equation 1 6 the wtp for access to fluoride safe water service is 1 7 w t p f l u o r i d e s a f e p p w 1 u p q u d p p p w 1 u p q u d p m p q u m p q u this estimates the compensating surplus measure for water quality connection at home and at the nearest public tap in other words it is the additional charges that each consumer is wtp and remains at the utility level before the change using whittington et al 1990 and whittington 2002 specification we estimate wtp using a multivariate regression analysis because willingness to pay varies across households based on demographic characteristics economic characteristics and the perceived attitudes towards quality of water services that can be denoted by x i in the expenditure function hence in general the wtp for an improved fluoride safe water connection is 1 8 w t p q m p q u 0 x i m p q u 0 x i in general income compensating functions willig 1976 could serve as a theoretical model for explaining households willingness to pay model considering willingness to pay as a welfare measure the income compensating function which includes arguments about the vector of respondents characteristics can be referred to as the willingness to pay function kwak and russell 1994 2 2 survey design and elicitation form the study used contingent valuation based survey questionnaire for investigating fluoride safe water service connection at home and at the nearest public tap the elicitation format was an open ended question format framed as follows q1 suppose the local government wants to invest in water quality fluoride level and water supply infrastructure to be able to provide quality drinkable water from the tap to your home for 24 h a day however without collecting sufficient water fees from households like yours it is difficult to maintain the sustainability of water supply hence what is the maximum amount of usd that you will pay per jerican 20 l water container for such a fluoride safe water supply connection in addition to your current bill q2 suppose the local government wants to invest in water quality fluoride level and water supply infrastructure at the community public tap that will be installed in your village close to your home 5 min walk for a two way trip to ensure everybody has access to fluoride safe drinking water that is available for 24 h however without collecting sufficient water fees from households like yours it is difficult to maintain the sustainability of the water supply hence what is the maximum amount of usd you will pay per jerican 20 l water container for such community fluoride safe water supply in addition to your current bill the open ended contingent valuation survey is more efficient than a single dichotomous yes no choice survey as a closed ended question would be would you be willing to pay usd m and this holds very less relevant information than a response to an open ended question like how much are you willing to pay haab and mcconnell 2003 however an open ended contingent valuation method cvm question format may also lead to overestimation or underestimation of wtp for the goods being valued unless given more attention to reduce the bias armbrecht 2014 nunes and nijkamp 2011 to reduce this bias the study used the contingent valuation questions at the last part of the survey section after respondents are aware of the topic and content of the questionnaire 2 3 sampling and sample size the study conducted multi stage sampling in such a way that the study area was first identified as the rift valley region where there are problems of excess fluoride with low water service supply in the second stage the zone and woredas were purposively selected guided by the regional water supply office s expert in identifying areas with excess fluoride then five woredas were selected and in each woreda the water supply office assisted the researcher in identifying specific kebeles with excess fluoride and water supply problems finally a list of households was obtained from each selected kebele and respondents were identified using systematic random sampling the sampling design is summarized below table 4 for the sake of reliability of the data the survey was conducted through personal interview 2 4 estimation method the economic valuation method applied is contingent valuation cv a social survey method where individuals are presented with information about a specific environmental change water quality improvement in this context the values of which are not accounted for in economic markets or captured through market based instruments the dependent variable for the model is wtp which is continuous data but censored at zero values less than zero or equal to zero are transformed to single value zero for people who have zero wtp or are not wtp for improvements in water services in the statistical context censoring means that the distribution of the underlined variable wtp may not be observed entirely and the unobservable portion of the distribution will be massed to a single value zero in this case the ols coefficient s estimates will not be consistent and the wtp will be overestimated kwak and russell 1994 to overcome this inconsistency the tobit model proposed by james tobin 1958 and amemiya 1984 is the best method which estimates parameter values using the maximum likelihood method mle therefore we applied tobit censored econometrics that is fitting in cases where the wtp dependent variable has continuous positive and non zero values rodríguez tapia et al 2017 wooldridge 2015 suppose the wtp for improved quality of water services for household i in the population is given by 1 9 wtp f z i q i ε i where z i a vector of household covariates qi is water quality characteristics and ε i is an error term that captures specification or measurement errors since there are people who have no wtp for improved water services in the survey sample to consider this reality the dependent variable is censored at zero and modelled as 1 10 wtp f z i q i ε i f o r w t p 0 w t p 0 f o r w t p 0 based on this behavioral model for a unit of the population the parameter for the function of f z i q i and the distribution of ε i is modelled as suppose h ε i is the likelihood density function for ε i and the density for wtp for household with positive wtp for water service improvements which is denoted by h wtp i wtp i 0 is stated as a conditional probability of observing wtpi provided wtp is greater than zero 1 11 h wtp i wtp i 0 h w t p i f z i q i p r f z i q i ε i 0 the denominator controls the density function for positive wtp to consider truncation by not observing zero wtp the possibility of observing a household with zero wtp is p r f z i q i ε i 0 accordingly the study constructed the ith contribution to the probability function as the multiplication of the probability that wtp is equal to zero and the probability that wtp is positive times the density of the positive wtp haab and mcconnell 2003 1 12 p r f z i q i ε i 0 1 i i p r f z i q i ε i 0 h w t p i f z i q i p r f z i q i ε i 0 where i i 1

wtp equals wtp when wtp 0 but wtp becomes zero when wtp 0 in the tobit model we have to estimate the marginal effects of xi explanatory variables from the change in wtp rodríguez tapia et al 2017 3 results and discussions 3 1 descriptive results the households average income per month is estimated to be 2260 etb ethiopian birr 83 usd the livelihood of rural households in ethiopia depends on the assets they have such as livestock size and farming income rather than a monthly income the average family size was six persons per household regarding their occupation the majority of the respondents are farmers followed by those who run their own business the source of water supply for most of the respondents is a public tap 32 4 percent followed by open sources including lakes rivers springs and public bore holes 21 2 percent for those who get water from the pipeline the frequency of water service disconnections is three times per month on average 60 8 percent although this varies from woreda to woreda once the service is disconnected the outages last for more than 24 h according to most of the respondents 43 5 percent there is no official time schedule when the service is disconnected neither there is prior notification about service interruption table 5 regarding the alternative water consumption the average money expenditure on drinking bottled and other clean water source was about 99 40 etb usd 3 62 per month per household compared to their total water bills per month and their total income per month the amount of money spent on getting safe water services was 87 percent and 4 percent for bottled and other clean water respectively this is a significant expenditure compared to their monthly earnings and it implies the existence of a serious water supply problem in the area under investigation in addition households are willing to travel for about a quarter of an hour on average to get better quality water by trading off an opportunity cost of their time the current water expenditure accounts for nearly 5 percent of the monthly income of the respondents as estimated using the kernel density estimates as shown in fig 1 the willingness to pay for fswsc varies across gender fig 2 assuming other things are constant the result shows that females have more willingness to pay than their male counterparts do furthermore the impact of gender age and other socioeconomic and demographic variables are included in the next econometrics section 3 2 estimation results the ordinary least square ols and the tobit model are estimated and the results are summarized below table 6 it is estimated that the wtp for a fluoride safe drinking water connection is etb 3 69 usd 0 13 cents per jerican at home with 24 h availability accordingly a household that consumes 2 m3 of fluoride safe water per month will pay usd 13 45 etb 370 to compare this result with some previous studies rodríguez tapia et al 2017 estimated a total wtp for quality of water supply in mexico city to be usd 3 10 per home bi monthly while gonzález davila o 2013 estimated a households wtp for fluoride safe and arsenic safe water in mexico to be usd 2 7 and 3 2 per month respectively the results of the estimated model show that perceptions about fluoride levels prior information notification services and overall dissatisfaction rate positively influenced households wtp for fluoride safe drinking water connections all of the perception variables are statistically significant in influencing households decision to pay in addition to the factors of perception the source of water supply has a strong influence on the respondents wtp for instance households whose water source is through pipelines are less willing to pay for the improved quality of water services perhaps perceiving that there is no significant difference in the quality of the water as compared to those who depend on open sources of water since the majority of the people in the study area are not connected to pipelines at home and mainly obtain water from open source like lakes rivers and bore holes private and common and rarely from public taps they have more willingness to pay compared to those who already have a connection at home purchasing bottled water increases wtp by etb 0 001 usd 0 00004 and an increase in income increases wtp by etb 0 158 usd 0 006 another high impact social variable is the number of children less than 5 years in the family and whether the households have own house or not as a household has usually more than one child in the family its additional wtp for fluoride safe drinking water per jerican is 0 058 etb usd 0 002 likewise as a household owns a house wtp for fluoride safe water service connection increases by 0 287 etb usd 0 01 among the demographic variables age of the respondents male dominated family headship and family size have a negative impact on households willingness to pay for fluoride safe drinking water at home the implications of these are that older people are less educated in the ethiopian context and more resistance for changes and less value for fluoride safe water as a matter of culture females are responsible for fetching water and taking care of household activities so they value quality of water more than males do the impact of family size on households willingness to pay for fluoride safe water is insignificant in both models another important variable is education of household head which has a positive influence on households wtp for fluoride safe water service by considering the education variable as a dummy those who have attended formal schooling are more willing to pay for fluoride safe water than those who do not have any formal schooling assuming other things are constant this implies that educated households have more awareness about the impact of fluoride on health and hence value their own and their families health more than the illiterate households concerning with the present water related variables the monthly water bill had a negative impact on wtp for quality of water while the volume of water consumption had a positive impact on households wtp for quality water because households income is limited a higher current bill will lead to less wtp for fluoride safe water supply whereas the more the volume of water consumed by households the more wtp for fluoride safe water these results are consistent with findings of rodríguez tapia et al 2017 in mexico location which was categorized based on fluoride concentration level shows that the respondents from adama and lume had negative wtp for fluoride safe water as compared to those from bora and zuway dugda woredas these results make sense as far as the location is concerned since bora and zuway dugda have higher fluoride concentration level and more severely affected victims of fluoride consumption hence the residents in these woredas are more wtp for safe water than their counterparts in the other woredas considered in this study the second model is the willingness to pay for fluoride safe water service connection to the nearest public taps accordingly the ols and censored tobit estimated results are summarized in table 7 the estimated wtp for fluoride safe water per jerican from the nearest public tap is etb 1 80 usd 0 065 cents for households who consume 6 jericans per week or 24 jericans per month for drinking and cooking from the nearest public tab the estimated wtp is etb 43 20 usd 1 6 and the households who consume 2m3 per month have a wtp of etb 180 usd 6 55 this estimated figure is quite reasonable and affordable compared to the current private vendor water bills and other opportunity costs many socioeconomic and demographic variables included in this model have almost a similar effect with the first model about connection to fluoride safe water service at home except the magnitudes and signs of few variables for instance perceptions of prior notification about the water service are insignificant in influencing a households wtp for fluoride safe water and variables such as own house income family size and volume of water consumption are insignificant in influencing households wtp for fluoride safe water connected to the nearest public tap per jerican with regard to income effect the results show that people with higher incomes do not necessarily have more wtp for public tap connections instead it is the poor households who prefer this source of water this result is similar to jonson et al 2003 study in sri lanka where the poor households did not necessarily prefer private taps to public and mini grid lines for water this study shows that households who get water from sources other than a pipeline have more wtp for improved water as compared to families whose source is pipelines see fig 2 3 3 comparison of wtp results by distance to sources assuming a given household consumes 2m3 of fluoride safe water per month for drinking cooking and washing that it gets either at home or from nearest public tap the estimated mean wtp using the open ended cvm methods is quite comparable consumers who willing to have pipeline connection at home have slightly higher wtp for quality water than those who willing to rely on the nearest public tap connection the mean willingness to pay for fluoride safe water connected at home is etb 370 usd 13 45 per month and that of wtp for the nearest public tap safe water is etb 180 usd 6 55 per month comparisons of the mean willingness to pay is presented in fig 3 3 4 cost benefit analysis from 2002 to 2010 the government of ethiopia invested etb 276 3 million usd 2 1 million for water supply projects in five woredas in the rift valley region which is adjacent to this study area datturi et al 2015 it was aimed that the water supply would cover about 827 000 residents in the area which is almost the same as the population in the woredas targeted by this study 831 000 population csa 2013 in addition to the usd 2 1 million initial investment which includes cost of developing water sources bone char and all costs incurred in the setting up of the entire scheme such as water tanks pipe lines kiosks and water storage the estimated operational cost for a 20 year life span of the water supply scheme is calculated to be etb 25 3 million usd 1 95 million datturi et al 2015 the estimated yearly operational costs include maintenance electricity chemicals water caretakers salary and other miscellaneous expenses water was provided to the community after treatment of fluorides in community based water taps considering the total investment and operational costs per m3 of that project as a proxy cost for our study and adding the current inflation rate for calculating the total cost we can calculate the cost benefit analysis therefore if we calculate the total mean willingness to pay for the all households in the five woredas using the estimated monthly wtp of each household fig 3 and by comparing it with the initial investment and operation costs we can verify the potential cost benefit analysis and estimate its potential for consumers in getting fluoride safe water hence we considered the aggregate mean wtp of all households living in the sampled woredas for this fluoride safe water supply project for a period of 20 years as the benefit of such a service in the benefit cost analysis estimation the total mean willingness to pay for fswsc by considering a yearly present value of mean wtp for up to 20 years using a seven percent annual discount rate 3 3 the national bank of ethiopia base money rate in april 2018 was used as an annual discount rate is given as woo et al 2017 1 16 t o t a l mwtp a l l h h t 1 20 a n u a l m w t p a l l h h y e a r 1 0 07 t 1 where the annual average wtp of all households is the product of individual average wtp estimated by each model results times the number of households in the five woredas csa 2013 times 12 months the estimated results are given in table 8 it is estimated that the total investments and operational costs for the fluoride safe water supply project scheme was etb 301 5 million usd 23 2 million datturi et al 2015 as we have calculated the total lifetime average wtp for fluoride safe water by cvm methods table 8 this is larger than the total cost of the project therefore compared to the investments and operational costs the supply of fluoride safe drinking water in the rift valley region is economically feasible since the residents willingness to pay is sufficient to recover the investment and operational costs given other things are constant the estimated aggregate present value of mean wtp for a fluoride safe water connection at home is about usd 253 5 million and for connection at the nearest public tap is about usd 123 3 million all these values are greater than the total cost of the clean water supply project assumed usd 23 2 million the estimated value of wtp may be overestimated since consumers are valuing the quality of water services hypothetically for instance according to datturi et al 2015 the treated water tariff per meter cube in the adjacent woreda was etb 22 usd 0 8 cents whereas the stated willingness to pay for 1 m cube of fluoride safe water is about etb 90 usd 3 3 this huge difference can be attributed to different factors including strategic or response bias therefore the results imply that there is huge potential willingness to pay if people are provided fluoride safe water services in the study area fig 4 below shows the benefit cost ratio of fluoride safe water service connection in million usd to sum up it is possible to provide fluoride safe drinking water to rift valley s residents who are suffering from skeletal and dental fluorosis provided that there is commitment from the woreda regional water supply office as explained in the cost benefit analysis there is huge potential wtp for safe water if the providers strategically design the payment mechanism and scheme through installments instead of one time payment to overcome the financial constraints the income share of households wtp for fluoride safe water per month ranges from 8 percent to 16 percent in addition this result is comparable to the findings of other studies such as vásquez et al 2009 in mexico which shows that households median wtp for safe and drinkable water was greater than their current water bill at least by 45 6 percent and greater than 5 7 percent of the customers median income gunatilake 2012 shows that households are willing to pay 3 6 percent of their incomes for water service improvement and rodríguez tapia et al 2017 shows that consumers were willing to pay 0 22 percent of their income for quality of water services in mexico city hensher et al 2005 shows that households are willing to pay 19 percent of their annual bills to receive prior notifications about water service interruptions and lee 2014 estimated that households wtp at about 18 2 percent of the current bill rate per cubic water consumption in ulsan city in south korea gonzález davila 2013 shows that households wtp for fluoride and arsenic removal was usd 2 7 and 3 22 per month respectively in mexico 4 conclusion and policy implications clean water supply is still a luxury item in the rural areas of developing country in our study area rural households are suffering from a problem of excess fluoride concentration in the drinking water considering this problem the study has conducted households willingness to pay for fluoride safe water service connections at two different sources using an ordinary least square mothed this study reveals that the estimated wtp for 2m3 of fluoride safe water consumption connected at home and at the nearest public tap are usd 13 70 and usd 6 84 per month respectively in addition using the censored tobit model the estimated wtp for 2m3 of fswsc at home and at the nearest public tap are usd 13 45 and usd 6 54 per month respectively considering households only as a source of funds it is possible to provide fluoride safe water services from the financial perspective to the rift valley residents since the aggregated present value of total wtp is greater than the total cost of fluoride safe water supply project over the life span of 20 years that means the provision of fluoride safe water supply is financially feasible in the study area given other things are constant furthermore in addition to estimating mean wtp other factors which influence households wtp such as perceptions about the quality of water degree of dissatisfaction education own house and number of children less than 5 years were also explored all of which having a positive influence on households wtp age of respondents water bill the male gender and location of the respondents those in adama and lume had a negative influence on households willingness to pay for fluoride safe drinking water bottled water is 1150 times more expensive than the current woreda water tariffs and 200 times more expensive than the current stated household willingness to pay for 2m3 of fluoride safe water 4 4 2 l of bottled water cost etb 15 usd 0 55 and 2000 l cost etb 15 000 usd 545 in january 2018 this shows that households will be glad to be connected to an improved public pipeline water service since it is less costly than adopting alternative forms of water purification methods some of the policy implications are that the government water provider needs to mobilize funds from households and from other donor agents including the world bank in addition to other stakeholders households are willing to pay a significant amount of money if they are provided with fluoride safe water services the government needs to invite private providers in the water supply sector the private sector can easily be attracted because fluoride safe water supply is economically feasible according to the cost benefit analysis result for instance countries like england and chile have fully privatized the water sector and france usa cote d ivore south africa malaysia colombia poland and mexico have partially privatized the sector with mixed ownership marin 2009 by establishing strict regulations inviting private water providers could be an alternative to enhance fluoride safe water supply coverage creating public private partnerships for service delivery is another viable option for the government the government can still have the ownership and can outsource some service delivery for some duration of time public private partnerships are common forms in which the private sector can participate in the water supply sector marin 2009 for instance in kenya the local water utility created a public private partnership with those who have private bore holes in the community by transferring them to networks of water kiosks in the community njeru and alukwe 2014 the local public water supply company invested in rehabilitating and equipping the fragmented private bore holes constructing storage pipeline distribution and a network of water kiosks this can be a good lesson for ethiopia since both countries share similar situations with regard to the fluoride problem in this way the local government in the rift valley region at kebele level can also intervene and supply reliable and affordable water services through a network of water kiosks and community taps besides creating employment for kiosk operators and reducing school dropout rates because of inadequate water vending or time spent in water collecting or water borne diseases thereby increasing the overall social welfare creating public private partnerships is a typical solution which is mostly overlooked by local governments the government needs to install community based fluoride safe public taps according to the wtp analysis for the nearest public tap fluoride safe water service connection households particularly the relatively poorer ones have wtp for it since they believe that they cannot afford to pay for the connection fee at home and instead would like to pay more for safe water services from the nearest public tap hence the government should provide community based fluoride safe water public taps as a good intervention that can be used for tackling the problem of lack of clean water supply at least in the short run although the study has insightful policy implications in the fluoride victim region it has its own limitations from methodological point of view the open ended contingent valuation survey may have its own drawbacks although it provides a simple direct valuation of fluoride safe water services the respondents may not have a frame of reference to respond accurately because consumers value attributes of the goods more than the goods per se as a result the wtp data may be subject to overestimation or underestimation compared to other double bounded dichotomous choice formats bennett and blamey 2001 hence the study suggests future researchers to consider better elicitation formats declaration of competing interest the authors would like to disclose that there is no conflict of interest acknowledgements the authors would like to thank international it policy program itpp at seoul national university and adama science and technology university for the financial support provided to this research work 
12188,in this study the iron impregnated activated carbons derived from waste citrus limetta peels ac clps has been employed for the first time to remove the fluoride ions from water the adsorbents were prepared by activating the selected biomass with fecl3 and subsequent carbonization at two different temperatures 250 c and 500 c and the synthesized carbon materials were designated as ac clp250 and ac clp500 respectively the synthesized activated carbons were characterized by particle size distribution point of zero charge phzpc scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray edx fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and x ray diffraction xrd analyses the influence of different operating parameters including adsorbent dose initial concentration of fluoride contact time solution ph and temperature on the sequestration of the fluoride ions were studied for both carbon materials the optimal conditions were observed as ph of 6 6 adsorbent dosage of 1 0 g l 1 and contact time of 240 min the langmuir and freundlich isotherms were analyzed to understand the adsorption process on the surface of the adsorbents langmuir isotherm model agreed with the equilibrium data to a greater extent indicating monolayer adsorption of fluoride ions onto ac clps the fluoride uptake capacities were found to be 4 926 and 9 709 mg g 1 by the langmuir isotherm for ac clp250 and ac clp500 respectively it was found that the adsorption process follows the pseudo second order kinetics suggesting that the defluoridation process is chemisorption also the boundary layer effect and intra particle diffusion models were employed to scrutinize the rate limiting step thermodynamic analysis revealed that the adsorption process was feasible spontaneous and endothermic in nature the removal efficacy of defluoridation process was increased with increase in temperature from 25 to 45 c these findings provide insights to explore further the adsorption process for removal of fluoride ions using fecl3 activated carbons derived from other agricultural wastes graphical abstract image 1 keywords citrus limetta peels defluoridation fecl3 activation activated carbon adsorption kinetics and isotherms 1 introduction fluoride is a very well known toxic contaminate existing in surface water and groundwater it is naturally found in groundwater and is also released into the groundwater from mineral resources such as fluorite and weathering of rocks e g shale basalt granite leaching of fluoride in groundwater may be possible if groundwater makes contact regularly with ores minerals and rocks consequently high fluoride concentration may yield in groundwater jacks et al 2005 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015a kumar et al 2016 raghav and kumar 2018 ali et al 2019 kimambo et al 2019 various industries are also involved in discharging of fluoride in surface water and groundwater these industries are semiconductor manufacturing factories pharmaceutical companies beryllium extraction plants aluminum smelters fertilizer manufacturing and mining industries paudyal et al 2011 the contamination of fluoride and its related diseases has been reported in many countries including algeria benin cameroon egypt ethiopia ghana ivory cost kenya libya malawi morocco nigeria rwanda sierra leone south africa sudan tanzania togo tunisia uganda zimbabwe china india indonesia iran pakistan saudi arabia south korea turkey yemen canada mexico usa argentina brazil estonia sweden uk england and wales and norway yadav et al 2013 kimambo et al 2019 the problems related to fluoride contamination are more severe in various states of india like andhra pradesh punjab haryana rajasthan gujarat uttar pradesh tamil nadu karnataka and maharashtra meenakshi et al 2008 arlappa et al 2013 ali et al 2018 2019 the concentration of fluoride in groundwater in a few parts of india is reported to be more than 30 mg l 1 sharma et al 2011 if the amount of fluoride in drinking water is more than 1 5 mg l 1 then it causes endemic dental and skeletal fluorosis and crippling vithanage and bhattacharya 2015b this was attributed to the fact that fluoride has a strong attraction with calcium ions occurring in the internal part of teeth and bones getachew et al 2015 due to the rapid growth and industrial demand in the global population has increased the use of groundwater resulting in the availability of poor water quality and reduction in the groundwater level inorganic pollutants such as fluoride heavy metals etc have a significant role in the contamination of groundwater fluoride is such a contaminant which holds an extreme threat to human beings it has been assessed that approximately 100 million people suffer from a high concentration of fluoride worldwide essadki et al 2009 the ingestion of high fluoride contaminated drinking water results in numerous types of diseases such as bone and skeletal fluorosis jagtap et al 2012 since the primary source of fluoride consumption is drinking water hence indian standard is 10500 has imposed the permissible value of 1 mg l 1 of fluoride in drinking water bureau of indian standards bis 2012 which is lower than 1 5 mg l 1 as suggested by who world health organization who 2006 therefore fluorosis mitigation has become an essential area of research and continues to attract more attention different techniques have been applied to remove the excess fluoride from polluted water before discharge to the environment these techniques include coagulation precipitation adsorption ion exchange reverse osmosis nano filtration electro dialysis and electro coagulation choong et al 2007 jagtap et al 2012 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015a thakur and mondal 2017 maity et al 2018 kimambo et al 2019 among all these techniques the adsorption process is a highly encouraging method which typically uses natural or synthetic solid adsorbents due to its favorable economics high energy efficiency ease of operation and reuse of the adsorbent used after its regeneration this technique is highly acceptable several adsorptive media non biomass have also been used to remove fluoride from drinking water these includes activated alumina ghorai and pant 2005 kaolinite and bentonite srimurali et al 1998 meenakshi et al 2008 hydrated ferric oxide dey et al 2004 activated bauxite das et al 2005 light weight concrete materials oguz 2007 and many natural as well as synthetic media fan et al 2003 mohapatra et al 2009 activated carbon ac is reflected to be a flexible adsorbing material due to its highly microporous structure large surface area and excellent surface reactivity and ample availability of functional groups acs have been applied widely for fluoride removal from waters by many researchers abe et al 2004 daifullah et al 2007 tomar et al 2014 mariappan et al 2015 apart from this the interest is growing to employ the inexpensive and eco friendly materials such as agricultural food waste and their by products for the adsorptive removal of fluoride ions from aqueous effluents due to its ubiquitousness cost effective and readily accessible features sarkar et al 2006 meenakshi et al 2008 conversely the utilization of waste bio materials has the benefit of not entailing extreme care and maintenance as well as solving their disposal issues however this biomass is deliberated as waste and waste minimization by bio waste is a sustainable decision for inventing the efficient fluoride removal technology citrus limetta peels are naturally abundant pectinaceous waste bio materials which are generated in large quantities from the fruit juice shops however these waste peels have no economic value and are considered as food agricultural waste thus in this research work the emphasis is on the production of adsorbent materials by using this food waste this alteration of unwanted waste peels to valuable commodity and value added sorbents will contribute to the remediation of fluoride laden wastewater the peels of c limetta have high pectin content with the abundant presence of carboxyl groups which is an excellent antidote for controlling cholesterol and blood sugar baker 1994 also c limetta peels have been found to be excellent adsorbent for heavy metals removal schiewer and balaria 2009 suryavanshi and shukla 2010 njikam and schiewer 2012 however segregation of spent sorbing materials from liquid solution is a nontrivial task due to their low specific gravity and tendency to agglomerate these issues have widely restricted its application in batch and column mode in this regard magnetic separation is a convenient technique in which adsorbent particles can be separated from a suspension by using an external magnetic field zhao et al 2010 this separation technique has recently gained prominence in water treatment processes and is now recognized as a potential technique to address the above issues in this work a locally sourced waste biomass i e c limetta peels were processed into fine particles and then treated with fecl3 6h2o followed by carbonization at two different temperatures 250 c and 500 c intending to develop novel magnetic bio waste activated carbons i e ac clps however to the best of our knowledge this kind of treatment practice has not been invented yet to adsorb fluoride ions from aqueous media our preliminary investigation indicated that there is a strong affinity between fluoride and activated carbons derived from c limetta peels thus this work is devoted to studying in depth the potentiality of the studied ac clps towards the defluoridation process with respect to different physico chemical parameters such as adsorbent dose initial fluoride concentration ph contact time and temperature different models of adsorption kinetic such as pseudo first order pseudo second order intra particle diffusion and boyd models were employed to reveal the mechanism of fluoride removal by the adsorbents as mentioned earlier isotherm models and thermodynamic parameters were also analyzed by fitting the experimental data 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all the chemicals used during the research work were of analytical grade and used without further purification this includes anhydrous sodium chloride naf ferric chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o sodium hydroxide naoh and hydrochloric acid hcl ionic strength

limetta sweet lime peels were procured from a local juice vendor located nearby areas of bbau campus lucknow uttar pradesh india it was washed several times with distilled water to remove the impurities and dust particles and subsequently dried in an air oven at 105 c until a constant weight was achieved the dried bio materials were then grounded using a domestic mixer grinder and screened out to obtain the size fraction of 10 μm the resulting product was then mixed with 150 ml distilled water and fecl3 6h2o to achieve fecl3 6h2o c limetta peel powder in the ratio of 1 3 i e 10 g 30 g the mixture was mechanically stirred at room temperature and 120 rpm for 4 h then it was kept overnight the mixture was separated by peristaltic pump filtration and dehydrated at 105 c in a hot air oven for 12 h the completely dehydrated material was then subjected to thermal treatment in a muffle furnace icon instruments company india at two different temperature i e 250 c and 500 c with a retention time of 2 h after carbonization the produced adsorbents were washed with double distilled water to remove residual chemical until a neutral ph 6 0 7 0 was achieved finally the samples were dried at 105 c for 12 h and stored in an air tight container for further defluoridation experiments the activated carbon materials obtained from two different calcination temperatures 250 c and 500 c were labeled as ac clp250 and ac clp500 respectively the steps of adsorbent preparation are discussed in fig 1 2 3 determination of fluoride concentration in solution fluoride solution was prepared by dissolving 224 0 mg of naf in 1000 ml of distilled water and a series of diluted samples were then prepared such that they have working concentrations of 5 10 15 20 and 30 mg l 1 the residual fluoride concentration and ph of the aqueous solution were determined using ion selective electrode method according to the standard methods apha 4500 f c 97 by employing a digital ion meter eutech ion 6 thermo scientific 2 4 characterization of magnetic ac clps zeta nanosizer nano zs90 was used to analyze the particle size distribution of ac clps after dissolving particles in ethanol the particle size of the adsorbent was determined by particle size analyzer to determine the point of zero charge phzpc of the adsorbent the solution ph was adjusted in a range of 2 0 10 0 with intervals of 2 with

to 4000 cm 1 x ray diffraction patterns of ac cps were obtained on a powder x ray diffractometer pw 3040 60 panalytical netherlands and the samples were scanned from 10 to 80 at the rate of 2 per min 2 5 adsorption experiments for removal of fluoride by ac clps all the adsorption studies were performed in batch mode at 25 c by varying the initial fluoride concentration from 5 to 30 mg l 1 in each experiment an accurately weighed amount of ac clps was mixed to 25 ml of fluoride solution with a known initial concentration taken in 150 ml capacity of volumetric flask and stirred in a water bath shaker li wbis 20 labard instruchem pvt ltd india at a speed of 120 rpm allowing equilibrium to be achieved at the end of the desired contact time the volumetric flasks were removed from the shaker and filtered through whatman 42 filter paper in order to segregate the solid adsorbent particles the filtrate was then measured by using ion selective electrode method to determine the residual fluoride concentrations adsorption study was conducted to define the basic parameters contact time 30 300 min solution ph 4 10 adsorbent dose 0 5 3 0 g l 1 temperature 25 45 c and initial fluoride concentration 5 30 mg l 1 the experiments were carried out at optimum ph ph 6 6 of the fluoride solution except for the effect of ph variation study data obtained from the tests as mentioned earlier also assisted in investigating the adsorption isotherm i e langmuir and freundlich models as well as its kinetics mechanism through pseudo first order pseudo second order intra particle diffusion and boyd models each test was performed in duplicates in order to diminish the error and the average values were reported here the defluoridation efficacy and equilibrium adsorption capacity were calculated using the following equations 1 removal c 0 c e c 0 100 2 q e mg g 1 c 0 c e v m where c 0 and c e are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of fluoride ions respectively mg l 1 v is the volume of the solution l and m is the adsorbent mass g 3 result and discussion 3 1 characterization of the adsorbents ac clps 3 1 1 particle size analysis and point of zero charge phzpc the particle size of ac clps was determined by homogenizing with ethanol and subsequently analyzed through zeta nanosizer at room temperature particle size data is plotted as shown in fig 2 a ac clp250 peak depicts a higher intensity than ac clp500 as represented in the particle size scattering curve the peak showing the size of particles in the solution was observed in the range of 325 1118 nm for ac clp250 and 249 1278 nm for ac clp500 more extensive range of particles were found in ac clp500 it may be explained that at high temperature biomass was first thermally decomposed into smaller particles and then some particles were clumped into bigger particles after cooling the point of zero charge phzpc of an adsorbent is an important representative that determines the electrical charge behavior of ac clps surfaces fig 2 b reveals that the interpretation between phinitial and δph i e phfinal phinitial are interconnected at ph 2 17 and 4 61 which are represented as phzpc values of the activated carbons ac clp250 and ac clp500 respectively in case of ph phzpc the adsorbent surface charge is positive whereas when ph phzpc the surface charge is negative from the results observed in fig 2 b both the activated carbons seem to have more acid active groups than basic components on their surfaces this might have occurred due to the minimization of acidic groups with the increase in carbonization temperature and accordingly the loss of significant acidic groups such as phenolic carboxylic or lactonic groups are also enhanced moreover the thermal activation contributes to the liberation of acidic metal oxides on the material surfaces tchomgui kamga et al 2010 in contrast the number of basic groups increases with increase in the carbonization temperature for most of the parts the synthesized ac clps are characterized as acidic fig 2 b the phzpc study also signifies that a positive charge behavior in ac clps surface will be favorable for the adsorptive removal of anionic pollutants when the ph values are lower than the phzpc from the results of fig 7 we found that the phzpc increases with increasing carbonization temperature 3 1 2 sem and edx analyses morphological analysis of ac clps was carried out by sem fig 3 the sem images were aimed to distinguish the micrographs obtained from the activation process with two different temperatures 250 c i e ac clp250 and 500 c i e ac clp500 in fig 3 a and c the sem images showed an external surface which is quite uneven and formed by irregular shapes which could not be considered as pores but provide channels to the interior of the material consequently it is assumed to be saturated by the availability of pores of different sizes during the activation process the chemical activator from the synthesized activated carbon experiences the evaporation which further creates the framework of pores uçar et al 2009 the formation of cavities also offered the pathway to the fluoride ions for accessing the pores of the carbon surface moreover the sem images of ac clps explore the cuboidal pyramidal shaped crystal structures due to the cluster formation of fe3o4 particles fig 3 b and d the elemental compositions of prepared ac clps at two different temperatures were examined by edx analysis the quantitative measurements of all the elements present in the sorbent materials are compiled in table 1 after the thermal activation process it is understandable that the residual chlorine contents in both the adsorbents ac clps stimulated from the initial chloride salt i e fecl3 furthermore it can be inferred that the weight percentage of chloride decreases from 21 74 to 13 97 with increase in the carbonization temperature from 250 c to 500 c this chloride loss might be corroborated due to the involvement of drying and carbonization steps most likely as hcl in reality we are unconvinced about the significance of residual chloride for the removal of fluoride ions however more detailed studies are to be carried out to reveal clearer insight 3 1 3 ftir analysis the functional groups on the surface of ac clp250 and ac clp500 were examined by ftir spectra fig 4 a the ftir spectrum of ac clp250 reveals the presence of characteristic peaks at 3383 2902 1619 1442 1249 and 582 cm 1 whereas in case of ac clp500 the predominant peaks at 3422 3032 2876 1618 1441 1217 552 and 468 cm 1 were observed the broad absorption peaks at 3383 cm 1 in case of ac clp250 and 3422 cm 1 in case of ac clp500 were attributed to the availability of surface groups such as phenol carboxylic acids and its derivatives as well as the presence of physically adsorbed water on the material singh et al 2011 in fig 4 a the peaks at 3011 2902 and 2876 cm 1 were attributed to the c h stretching vibrations which further implies that minute quantity of some residual carbon of c limetta exists in ac clps schiewer and balaria 2009 the peaks at 1618 and 1619 cm 1 were assigned to the c o stretching vibration of quinonic and carboxylate groups mondal et al 2019 and the peaks at 1000 1300 cm 1 corresponding to c o stretching vibration of lactonic and phenolic groups present in the ac clp surfaces singh and majumder 2016 next saha et al 2013 reported that the peak at 1440 cm 1 could be attributed to symmetric bending of ch3 groups the peaks in the 400 600 cm 1 range could be attributed to fe o bond vibration of fe3o4 particles sun et al 2006 and conversely the characteristic absorption peak around 630 cm 1 was not observed in the ftir spectra of the ac clp materials which again confirmed the non availability of γ fe2o3 particles fu et al 2008 namduri and nasrazadani 2008 finally it was perceived that the minor shift in the positions of the characteristics peaks after the fluoride adsorption indicate the plausible interaction between the studied active carbons and fluoride ions through oh co c o and fe o functional groups 3 1 4 xrd analysis fig 4 b reveals the xrd patterns for the ac clp250 and ac clp500 carbons in both the cases for the adsorbent the occurrence of board peaks at about 24 was the confirmation of active carbons which have amorphous structure consequently it does not provide quantitative peaks to evaluate the crystallization mode of the ac clps the formation of the cubic spinels was corroborated from the xrd patterns for magnetite by comparing with jcpds file 89 43191 the diffraction peaks located at 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 are recognized the fe3o4 magnetite shen et al 2013 furthermore it can be observed that iron oxide peaks became better delineated and possessed higher intensities when the carbonization temperature is enhanced 3 2 preliminary batch adsorption study to investigate the adsorption potentiality of ac clp250 and ac clp500 for fluoride removal several factors were analyzed the factors include adsorbent dose initial fluoride concentration contact time solution ph and temperature all adsorption experiments were performed at ph 6 6 excluding the effect of ph study simultaneously the best value of the process parameter described above can be considered as the optimized condition the adsorption profile of fluoride removal on the synthesized ac clps is shown in fig 5 the experiment was carried out at 25 c for 240 min by adding 1 0 g l 1 of adsorbent dosage to 25 ml aqueous solution of fluoride ion having an initial concentration of 10 mg l 1 the adsorption of fluoride ions increased with the increase of contact time for both the adsorbents however a saturation of adsorption rate for fluoride removal takes place when the contact time is 240 min the equilibrium percentage removal in ac clp250 for fluoride ions is nearly 61 0 while in case of ac clp500 it is equal to 73 2 consequently ac clp500 exhibited higher fluoride removal percentage than ac clp250 for identical optimized conditions this is because of the greater availability of internal pores in case of active carbon synthesized at 500 c the as prepared activated carbon was expected to be efficient adsorbent for fluoride removal 3 2 1 effect of adsorbent dose on fluoride removal efficacy fig 6 a and b illustrate the influence of adsorbent dose on the percentage removal of fluoride ions by the activated carbons ac clp250 and ac clp500 respectively the effect of adsorbent loading on the removal of fluoride ions by ac clps were carried out at four different adsorbent dosages of 0 5 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 g l 1 while the experimental conditions such as ph 6 6 temperature 25 c initial fluoride concentration 10 mg l 1 remain constant at varying time intervals of 30 60 120 180 240 and 300 min the removal percentage of fluoride by ac clp250 increases from 20 4 to a maximum sorption rate of 65 0 with increasing the adsorbent dose from 0 5 to 1 0 g l 1 while in case of ac clp500 the removal efficacy is increased from 42 1 to 72 9 with increasing the adsorbent dose from 0 5 to 1 0 g l 1 the increase in the removal efficacy with an increase in adsorbent dose is due to the increase in adsorbent mass therefore more number of active sites were available for the defluoridation process next the substantial decrease in removal efficiency after the adsorbent dosage of 1 0 g l 1 might occur due to an increase in particle aggregation experiencing from the excessive sorbent mass consequently it reduces the total availability of sorption sites and also enhances the diffusional path length shukla et al 2002 similarly defluoridation rate also increased with increase in contact time up to 240 min thereafter no significant removal was observed by escalating the contact time fig 6 a and b it is because initially a large number of vacant sorption sites were accessible and after optimum contact period sorption rate slowed down due to plausible monolayer formation on the external surface pores of the sorbent materials and pore diffusion onto the interior surface of the adsorbent the aforesaid observation attained through the adsorbate film layer due to continuous shaking during the present sorption study yadav et al 2013 therefore the adsorbent dosage of 1 0 g l 1 in 240 min was selected as optimum for further fluoride removal studies 3 2 2 effect of initial fluoride ion concentration and contact time the combined influence of initial fluoride ion concentration and contact time for the maximum removal efficacy of fluoride was studied the adsorbent dosage solution ph temperature and shaking speed were fixed at 1 0 g l 1 6 6 25 c and 120 rpm respectively the percentage removal of fluoride was quantified by choosing an initial fluoride ion concentration from 5 mg l 1 to 30 mg l 1 with varying the contact time from 30 min to 300 min the percentage of defluoridation rate decreased with an increase in initial fluoride ion concentration fig 6 c and d this is due to the fact that the number of active sites on the adsorbent surface is not adequate to accommodate the fluoride ions under higher concentration of fluoride in contrast at lower concentration of fluoride the relative proportion of surface active sites to total fluoride is much higher and consequently fluoride ions can interact with the active sites present on the adsorbent surface the maximum removal efficacy of fluoride is found to be 94 7 and 94 8 by employing the adsorbents ac clp250 and ac clp500 respectively with an initial concentration of 5 mg l 1 whereas the percentage removal diminished up to 5 0 and 33 3 in case of 30 mg l 1 of initial fluoride concentration respectively similar observation has been reported for fluoride removal using neem charcoal adsorbent chakrabarty and sarma 2012 therefore ac clp250 and ac clp500 are recognized to be effective adsorbents for fluoride removal under aqueous environment simultaneously fig 6 c and d depict the effect of contact time on fluoride removal efficacy of ac clps it was observed that fluoride removal gradually enhances with an increase in contact time and finally reaches the equilibrium at 240 min i e 4 h after that no significant change in fluoride removal was observed the overall defluoridation process was carried out in three different stages as explored in the aforesaid figures the initial stage revealed the high sorption uptake of fluoride ions onto the ac clps the second stage referred the gradual uptake of fluoride ions illustrating the utilization of all active sites over the surface of prepared adsorbents the third stage signified the saturation stage in which the adsorption uptake was relatively constant similar results were reported earlier by thakre et al 2015 for fluoride removal on chitin based adsorbent hence the optimum equilibrium contact time for subsequent adsorption studies was considered to be 240 min 3 2 3 effect of ph on fluoride removal efficacy the influence of the solution ph on the defluoridation process is one of the important parameter which relates with the active surface sites protonated or deprotonated of the adsorbent material as well as the degree of ionization of the adsorbate in the solution iriel et al 2018 fig 7 shows the effect of ph on the removal percentage of fluoride by ac clps the fluoride adsorption was studied in the ph range of 4 0 10 0 by keeping all the optimized parameters i e fluoride ion concentration 10 mg l 1 contact times of 240 min ac clps dose 1 0 g l 1 and temperature 25 c constant as seen in fig 7 the fluoride removal efficiency of ac clps increased significantly by increasing the ph from 4 0 to 6 6 and then decreased when the ph was further increased up to 10 0 the maximum fluoride removal efficacy was found to be 64 5 and 73 2 at natural ph 6 6 for ac clp250 and ac clp500 respectively moreover the decrease in fluoride removal was observed at highly alkaline ph 10 0 and acidic ph 4 0 conditions which are of no practical significance in real field engineering applications from the experimental data the phzpc values for ac clp250 and ac clp500 are 2 17 and 4 61 respectively fig 2 b the behavior of fluoride adsorption onto ac clps can be described by considering the point of zero charge phzpc of the adsorbent when the ph is lower than phzpc the adsorbent surface was positively charged and when it is higher than phzpc the adsorbent surface is negatively charged thus the defluoridation efficiency reduced for both the activated carbons when ph phzpc this is due to electrostatic repulsion between fluoride ions and negatively charged adsorbent surface and competition between fluoride ions and excess of hydroxyl anions but high removal efficiency of fluoride at ph phzpc is due to electrostatic attraction chen et al 2011 the reduction in fluoride removal under acidic conditions 4 0 6 0 was not only due to the formation of weak hydrofluoric acid but also for the loss of iron oxide from ac clps asgari et al 2012 hence the optimum ph value has been found to be 6 6 and this ph value was used for the following research similar ph profiles have been reported in the adsorption of fluoride onto tea waste supported by hydrous aluminium oxide nanoparticles cai et al 2015 3 2 4 effect of temperature on fluoride removal efficacy the effect of temperature on the adsorption of fluoride ions by the synthesized adsorbents ac clps were explored at three different temperatures 25 35 and 45 c whereas other equilibrium conditions like initial fluoride concentration 10 mg l 1 contact time 240 min ph 6 6 and adsorbent dose 1 0 g l 1 were kept constant hence the defluoridation efficiency is revealed in fig 8 a and b for the activated carbons derived at 250 and 500 c the observation shows that the percentage removal of fluoride increases with increase in temperature the maximum fluoride adsorption of 61 4 and 73 1 were observed at 25 c for the activated carbons ac clp250 and ac clp500 respectively which further enhanced up to 90 7 and 91 3 at 45 c the increasing adsorption trend at high temperature indicates that the defluoridation method is an endothermic process which may be due to the improving binding forces on the adsorbent surface at higher temperature ma et al 2011 according to elhalil et al 2016 it can cause a swelling effect within the internal structure of ac clps as well as increase the mobility of fluoride ions in order to penetrate the fluoride ions further 3 3 modeling of adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherm models were accompanied in order to achieve the adsorption behavior and adsorption capacity for removing a unit mass of fluoride by different ac clps although a variety of isotherm models are available in order to explore the mechanism of the adsorption process nevertheless the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models are the most commonly employed for surface sorption studies hameed and ahmad 2009 in the present work langmuir and freundlich isotherm models were used to elucidate the relationship between the solid phase concentration i e q e mg g 1 and the liquid phase concentration i e c e mg l 1 in this regard ac clps were contacted by increasing the fluoride concentrations from 5 mg l 1 to 30 mg l 1 at optimized conditions of the adsorbent dose of 1 0 g l 1 ph of 6 6 and temperature of 25 c 3 3 1 langmuir isotherm the adsorption capacities of the ac clp250 and ac clp500 corresponding to monolayer adsorption have been estimated by the langmuir model this model is indicative of saturation of binding sites of the adsorbent with negligible interaction among the adsorbed species saturated monolayer isotherm can be represented in eq 3 langmuir 1918 3 c e q e c e q max 1 k l q max where q e is the amount of fluoride ions adsorbed per mass of adsorbent mg g 1 c e is the equilibrium concentration of fluoride ions mg l 1 q max and k l are the langmuir constants related to the adsorption capacity mg g 1 and energy of adsorption l g 1 respectively the value of q max and k l can be obtained using a linear plot in between c e q e versus c e to corroborate whether the defluoridation process was favorable or not a dimensionless constant namely separation factor was employed separation factor r l according to the literature of hameed and ahmad 2009 is expressed in eq 4 4 r l 1 1 k l c 0 where c 0 is the initial fluoride concentration mg l 1 in eq 4 the values of r l can be employed to interpret the adsorption type specified as favorable 0 r l 1 unfavorable r l 1 linear r l 1 and irreversible r l 0 nayak and pal 2017 3 3 2 freundlich isotherm in the stated equation the freundlich isotherm model described the multilayer adsorption behavior of adsorbate molecules on the surface of the adsorbent freundlich 1906 this model assumes that the surface of the adsorbent has a different binding energy spectrum the linear form of the freundlich isotherm equation can be expressed by eq 5 5 log q e log k f 1 n log c e where k f mg g 1 l mg 1 1 n and n are the freundlich isotherm constants and k f is representing the adsorption capacity per unit mass of adsorbent the 1 n value reveals the heterogeneity factor when the value is greater than 1 it signifies the favorable adsorption of adsorbate onto the adsorbent surface the langmuir and freundlich constants with correlation coefficient r 2 values are highlighted in table 2 for both the adsorbents and the linear plots are observed in fig 9 a and b respectively the q e exp was compared with the q e cal obtained from the two isotherm models at 30 mg l 1 of fluoride concentration it is noticed that the values obtained from langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherms have a lower percentage of deviations most importantly in the case of langmuir isotherm the r 2 values are close to unity as compared to the freundlich isotherm hence this describes that the adsorptive behavior of fluoride onto ac clps obeyed the langmuir isotherm it signifies the monolayer coverage of adsorbate over a homogeneous adsorbent surface furthermore the values of n are much higher than unity which also corroborate the favorable adsorption process similarly to present the observation of the adsorption of fluoride onto chemically modified palm kernel shell was better explained by the langmuir model against freundlich isotherm bashir et al 2015 fig 10 reveals the r l values are between 0 and 1 for both the synthesized adsorbents suggesting favorable adsorption conditions by increasing the initial fluoride concentration the r l values diminish progressively due to the superior favorability at high fluoride concentration table 3 illustrates the comparison of the maximum adsorption capacity of fluoride by various biomass related low cost adsorbents with proposed adsorbents employed in this study compared to other adsorbents the performance of ac clps as reported in this study signifies its noteworthy real field applications in this study the adsorbents synthesized from waste c limetta peels explore a remarkable adsorption capacity than many other adsorbents procured till date 3 4 adsorption kinetics and its mechanism in order to examine the rate of adsorption for fluoride onto the ac clps two different kinetic models i e pseudo first order model lagergren 1898 and pseudo second order model ho and mckay 1998 were employed to simulate the experimental data the kinetic study was carried out by varying the contact time from 30 min to 300 min during the defluoridation process the adsorbent dosage solution ph and temperature were fixed at 1 0 g l 1 6 6 and 25 c respectively the validity of the best fit kinetic model was tested against the q e exp q e cal and r 2 values equation 6 illustrates the pseudo first order kinetic model 6 log q e q t log q e k 1 t 2 303 where k 1 represents the reaction rate constant min 1 for the pseudo first order model q e is the adsorption capacity in the equilibrium mg g 1 and q t is the amount of fluoride ions adsorbed at time t min the values of k 1 and q e cal were evaluated from the slopes and intercepts of the linear plots of ln q e q t versus t figure not given respectively and are showed in table 4 table 4 illustrates a disgraceful agreement between q e exp and q e cal values for the fluoride removal the smaller r 2 values for the pseudo first order kinetic model indicates the incompatibility of the pseudo first order model for fluoride adsorption onto the ac clps the pseudo second order kinetic model was further selected based on the equilibrium of the adsorption capacity as expressed in eq 7 7 t q t 1 k 1 q e 2 t q e where k 2 denotes the reaction rate constant g mg 1 min 1 for the pseudo second order kinetic model the values of k 2 and q e cal were calculated from the intercepts and slopes of the plots of t q t versus t fig 11 a and b respectively and are highlighted in table 4 table 4 explores that the correlation coefficient i e r 2 values of adsorption of fluoride ions for the pseudo second order model was higher than that of the pseudo first order model furthermore the adsorption capacity values i e q e cal calculated by the pseudo second order model also possessed a good agreement between experimental values i e q e exp as compared with the pseudo first order model this corroborated that the adsorption process of fluoride onto the ac clps could be considered as a pseudo second order model process which implies that the fluoride uptake process was chemisorption mechanisms moreover the mechanism of the defluoridation process can be described by the intra particle diffusion model weber and morris 1963 which can be explored by eq 8 8 q t k id t 0 5 c where k id represents the intra particle diffusion constant mg g 1 min 0 5 and the intercept c reveals the boundary layer diffusion effects or external film resistance generally the entire adsorption process can be classified into four segments i the adsorbate ions move from the bulk solution to the adsorbent surface by bulk diffusion phenomenon ii film diffusion of the adsorbate ions through the boundary layer in order to reach the external surface of the adsorbent iii intra particle diffusion of the adsorbate ions into an adsorption site by pore diffusion mechanism and iv adsorption takes place onto the active sites of the adsorbent surface while the energy will substantiate on the binding process either due to physical or chemical mechanisms michalak et al 2013 additionally it is also mandatory to understand the step which governs the overall removal rate in the defluoridation process by interpreting the experimental data the first and fourth steps were recognized to be rapid thus it cannot be suggested as the rate limiting step for the defluoridation process the adsorption rate will be monitored by external boundary layer diffusion or by intra particle diffusion or by both to illustrate the effect of intra particle diffusion the plots of q t versus t 0 5 are interpreted if the plot is linear and passing through the origin then it signifies that the entire adsorption process is governed by intra particle diffusion whereas if it does not pass through the origin irrespective of the linear relationship then it explores that the intra particle diffusion is not only the rate controlling step but other mechanisms are also included nayak and pal 2018 fig 11 c and d show that the plots of q t versus t 0 5 for ac clp250 and ac clp500 respectively were multi linear which indicates that more than one rate controlling mechanism affected the fluoride uptake onto the ac clps based on these plots the defluoridation processes of the four steps are encompassed by three phases suggesting that the intra particle diffusion is not only the rate limiting step the initial phase of the plot explored an external mass transfer whereas the second phase reveals a gradual adsorption is mainly due to the intra particle diffusion the last phase is the equilibrium stage in which the intra particle diffusion slows down due to lower availability of the fluoride concentration in the aqueous solution moreover due to the double scenario of intra particle diffusion consisting of both film and intra particle diffusion boyd s model was employed to understand whether the boundary layer film diffusion or the intra particle diffusion controls the adsorption process this model is expressed in eq 9 boyd et al 1947 9 f 1 6 π 2 m 1 1 m 2 exp m 2 b t where f is the fraction of fluoride ions adsorbed at any time t min and b t is mathematical fraction of f the parameter f can be obtained by the following expression 10 f q t q e since it is impossible to evaluate the values of b t for each fraction adsorbed from eq 9 by considering the fourier transform and integration reichenberg 1953 postulated the following expression 11 b t 0 4977 ln 1 f the b t values at different time intervals can be evaluated using eq 11 for various solute fractions the calculated b t values were interpreted against time t the boyd plots are revealed in fig 12 a and b for the adsorption of fluoride ions onto ac clp250 and ac clp500 respectively these boyd plots were employed to distinguish between the controlled mechanisms of the defluoridation process by either boundary layer film diffusion or intra particle diffusion if the plots of b t versus time t are linear and passing through the origin then the actual rate controlling step in the adsorption process is the intra particle pore diffusion otherwise they are governed by external film diffusion nethaji et al 2013 from the above mentioned figures it was observed that the plots were non linear and does not pass through the origin which corroborates that the rate determining step of the defluoridation process was revealed with the combined effects of both boundary layer film diffusion and intra particle pore diffusion 3 5 study of adsorption thermodynamics thermodynamics parameters is responsible for comprehensive information about the spontaneity and heat change of the adsorption process thermodynamics parameters such as gibbs free energy change δg kj mol 1 enthalpy change δh kj mol 1 and entropy change δs j mol 1 k 1 were calculated using the following equation mahmoodi et al 2011 12 k c q e c e 13 δ g rt ln k c 14 ln k c δ s r δ h rt where k c is the distribution constant q e mg g 1 is the amount of fluoride adsorbed on the ac clps at equilibrium c e mg l 1 is the equilibrium concentration in a solution and r 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 is the universal gas constant and t k is the absolute temperature the adsorption experiments were conducted at three different temperatures of 25 35 and 45 c and it was revealed that the removal percentage of fluoride increased with increasing temperature suggesting that the adsorption was more feasible at higher temperature δh and δs values were calculated from the slope and intercept of van t hoff plot of ln k c versus 1 t fig 12 c and obtained thermodynamic parameters were presented in table 5 the negative values of δg indicate the thermodynamically viable and spontaneous nature of the adsorption process by ac clp250 and ac clp500 borah et al 2015 the positive value of δh displays the endothermic nature of adsorption process the magnitude of δh value lies in the range of 2 1 20 9 and 80 200 kj mol 1 for physisorption and chemisorption respectively yu et al 2004 for the present study the δh value was found to be 72 581 and 64 833 kj mol 1 for the studied adsorbents of ac clp250 and ac clp500 respectively this concludes that the adsorption process followed the physico chemical mechanism hence the experimental data reveals that the adsorption of fluoride onto ac clps was favored and blocked at high temperatures the positive values of δs indicate the increased randomness at solid solution interface occurring in the internal structure during the adsorption of fluoride onto ac clp250 and ac clp500 4 conclusion in this study citrus limetta waste peels were employed to synthesize the activated carbons after chemical activation by impregnating with fecl3 the adsorbents obtained from two different carbonization temperatures 250 c and 500 c were assigned as ac clp250 and ac clp500 respectively and the potentiality of the activated carbons were examined for the adsorptive removal of fluoride ions from aqueous solution by increasing the initial fluoride concentration from 5 to 30 mg l 1 the removal efficiency decreased from 94 7 to 5 0 for ac clp250 and 94 8 33 3 for ac clp500 both the activated carbons were equally effective but ac clp250 did not corroborate the significant magnetic property compared to ac clp500 next the adsorption studies were performed as a function of adsorbent dosage initial concentration of fluoride contact time solution ph and temperature for both the adsorbents the removal efficiency was maximum at ph 6 6 almost neutral and decreases significantly on either side of ph 6 6 which would be appropriate for real field purification system the adsorption kinetics was found to follow the pseudo second order model whereas the adsorption isotherm followed the langmuir isotherm with high r 2 values ac clp250 0 9964 and ac clp500 0 9776 the maximum monolayer capacity obtained using the langmuir isotherm for ac clp250 and ac clp500 were 4 926 and 9 709 mg g 1 under the optimum conditions of adsorbent dosage 1 0 g l 1 contact time 240 min and temperature 25 c with fluoride concentration ranging from 5 to 30 mg l 1 the rate determining step of the defluoridation process was corroborated by both external film layer diffusion and intra particle diffusion mechanisms thermodynamic parameters were computed for the removal of fluoride and their values evoked that the defluoridation process was endothermic and spontaneous in the studied temperature range finally it could be concluded that ac clp can be effectively utilized for the adsorptive removal of fluoride ions from the aqueous environment acknowledgement facilities provided by

fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and x ray diffraction xrd analyses the influence of different operating parameters including adsorbent dose initial concentration of fluoride contact time solution ph and temperature on the sequestration of the fluoride ions were studied for both carbon materials the optimal conditions were observed as ph of 6 6 adsorbent dosage of 1 0 g l 1 and contact time of 240 min the langmuir and freundlich isotherms were analyzed to understand the adsorption process on the surface of the adsorbents langmuir isotherm model agreed with the equilibrium data to a greater extent indicating monolayer adsorption of fluoride ions onto ac clps the fluoride uptake capacities were found to be 4 926 and 9 709 mg g 1 by the langmuir isotherm for ac clp250 and ac clp500 respectively it was found that the adsorption process follows the pseudo second order kinetics suggesting that the defluoridation process is chemisorption also the boundary layer effect and intra particle diffusion models were employed to scrutinize the rate limiting step thermodynamic analysis revealed that the adsorption process was feasible spontaneous and endothermic in nature the removal efficacy of defluoridation process was increased with increase in temperature from 25 to 45 c these findings provide insights to explore further the adsorption process for removal of fluoride ions

isotherms 1 introduction fluoride is a very well known toxic contaminate existing in surface water and groundwater it is naturally found in groundwater and is also released into the groundwater from mineral resources such as fluorite and weathering of rocks e g shale basalt granite leaching of fluoride in groundwater may be possible if groundwater makes contact regularly with ores minerals and rocks consequently high fluoride concentration may yield in groundwater jacks et al 2005 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015a kumar et al 2016 raghav and kumar 2018 ali et al 2019 kimambo et al 2019 various industries are also involved in discharging of fluoride in surface water and groundwater these industries are semiconductor manufacturing factories pharmaceutical companies beryllium extraction plants aluminum smelters fertilizer manufacturing and mining industries paudyal et al 2011 the contamination of fluoride and its related diseases has been reported in many countries including algeria benin cameroon egypt ethiopia ghana ivory cost kenya libya malawi morocco nigeria rwanda sierra leone south africa sudan tanzania togo tunisia uganda zimbabwe china india indonesia iran pakistan saudi arabia south korea turkey yemen canada mexico usa argentina brazil estonia sweden uk england and wales and norway yadav et al 2013 kimambo et al 2019 the problems related to fluoride contamination are more severe in various states of india like andhra pradesh punjab haryana rajasthan gujarat uttar pradesh tamil nadu karnataka and maharashtra meenakshi et al 2008 arlappa et al 2013 ali et al 2018 2019 the concentration of fluoride in groundwater in a few parts of india is reported to be more than 30 mg l 1 sharma et al 2011 if the amount of fluoride in drinking water is more than 1 5 mg l 1 then it causes endemic dental and skeletal fluorosis and crippling vithanage and bhattacharya 2015b this was attributed to the fact that fluoride has a strong attraction with calcium ions occurring in the internal part of teeth and bones getachew et al 2015 due to the rapid growth and industrial demand in the global population has increased the use of groundwater resulting in the availability of poor water quality and reduction in the groundwater level inorganic pollutants such as fluoride heavy metals etc have a significant role in the contamination of groundwater fluoride is such a contaminant which holds an extreme threat to human beings it has been assessed that approximately 100 million people suffer from a high concentration of fluoride worldwide essadki et al 2009 the ingestion of high fluoride contaminated drinking water results in numerous types of diseases such as bone and skeletal fluorosis jagtap et al 2012 since the primary source of fluoride consumption is drinking water hence indian standard is 10500 has imposed the permissible value of 1 mg l 1 of fluoride in drinking water bureau of indian standards bis 2012 which is lower than 1 5 mg l 1 as suggested by who world health organization who 2006 therefore fluorosis mitigation has become an essential area of research and continues to attract more attention different techniques have been applied to remove the excess fluoride from polluted water before discharge to the environment these techniques include coagulation precipitation adsorption ion exchange reverse osmosis nano filtration electro dialysis and electro coagulation choong et al 2007 jagtap et al 2012 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015a thakur and mondal 2017 maity et al 2018 kimambo et al 2019 among all these techniques the adsorption process is a highly encouraging method which typically uses natural or synthetic solid adsorbents due to its favorable economics high energy efficiency ease of operation and reuse of the adsorbent used after its regeneration this technique is highly acceptable several adsorptive media non biomass have also been used to remove fluoride from drinking water these includes activated alumina ghorai and pant 2005 kaolinite and bentonite srimurali et al 1998 meenakshi et al 2008 hydrated ferric oxide dey et al 2004 activated bauxite das et al 2005 light weight concrete materials oguz 2007 and many natural as well as synthetic media fan et al 2003 mohapatra et al 2009 activated carbon ac is reflected to be a flexible adsorbing material due to its highly microporous structure large surface area and excellent surface reactivity and ample availability of functional groups acs have been applied widely for fluoride removal from waters by many researchers abe et al 2004 daifullah et al 2007 tomar et al 2014 mariappan et al 2015 apart from this the interest is growing to employ the inexpensive and eco friendly materials such as agricultural food waste and their by products for the adsorptive removal of fluoride ions from aqueous effluents due to its ubiquitousness cost effective and readily accessible features sarkar et al 2006 meenakshi et al 2008 conversely the utilization of waste bio materials has the benefit of not entailing extreme care and maintenance as well as solving their disposal issues however this biomass is deliberated as waste and waste minimization by bio waste is a sustainable decision for inventing the efficient fluoride removal technology citrus limetta peels are naturally abundant pectinaceous waste bio materials which are generated in large quantities from the fruit juice shops however these waste peels have no economic value and are considered as food agricultural waste thus in this research work the emphasis is on the production of adsorbent materials by using this food waste this alteration of unwanted waste peels to valuable commodity and value added sorbents will contribute to the remediation of fluoride laden wastewater the peels of c limetta have high pectin content with the abundant presence of carboxyl groups which is an excellent antidote for controlling cholesterol and blood sugar baker 1994 also c limetta peels have been found to be excellent adsorbent for heavy metals removal schiewer and balaria 2009 suryavanshi and shukla 2010 njikam and schiewer 2012 however segregation of spent sorbing materials from liquid solution is a nontrivial task due to their low specific gravity and tendency to agglomerate these issues have widely restricted its application in batch and column mode in this regard magnetic separation is a convenient technique in which adsorbent particles can be separated from a suspension by using an external magnetic field zhao et al 2010 this separation technique has recently gained prominence in water treatment processes and is now recognized as a potential technique to address the above issues in this work a locally sourced waste biomass i e c limetta peels were processed into fine particles and then treated with fecl3 6h2o followed by carbonization at two different temperatures 250 c and 500 c intending to develop novel magnetic bio waste activated carbons i e ac clps however to the best of our knowledge this kind of treatment practice has not been invented yet to adsorb fluoride ions from aqueous media our preliminary investigation indicated that there is a strong affinity between fluoride and activated carbons derived from c limetta peels thus this work is devoted to studying in depth the potentiality of the studied ac clps towards the defluoridation process with respect to different physico chemical parameters such as adsorbent dose initial fluoride concentration ph contact time and temperature different models of adsorption kinetic such as pseudo first order pseudo second order intra particle diffusion and boyd models were employed to reveal the mechanism of fluoride removal by the adsorbents as mentioned earlier isotherm models and thermodynamic parameters were also analyzed by fitting the experimental data 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all the chemicals used during the research work were of analytical grade and used without further purification this includes anhydrous sodium chloride naf ferric chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o sodium hydroxide naoh and hydrochloric acid hcl ionic strength adjuster isa solution order code fl isa1s batch no 0218 purchased from the fisher scientific a part of thermo fisher scientific inc is also used in our research 2 2 preparation of adsorbent citrus limetta sweet lime peels were procured from a local juice vendor located nearby areas of bbau campus lucknow uttar pradesh india it was washed several times with distilled water to remove the impurities and dust particles and subsequently dried in an air oven at 105 c until a constant weight was achieved the dried bio materials were then grounded using a domestic mixer grinder and screened out to obtain the size fraction of 10 μm the resulting product was then mixed with 150 ml distilled water and fecl3 6h2o to achieve fecl3 6h2o c limetta peel powder in the ratio of 1 3 i e 10 g 30 g the mixture was mechanically stirred at room temperature and 120 rpm for 4 h then it was kept overnight the mixture was separated by peristaltic pump filtration and dehydrated at 105 c in a hot air oven for 12 h the completely dehydrated material was then subjected to thermal treatment in a muffle furnace icon instruments company india at two different temperature i e 250 c and 500 c with a retention time of 2 h after carbonization the produced adsorbents were washed with double distilled water to remove residual chemical until a neutral ph 6 0 7 0 was achieved finally the samples were dried at 105 c for 12 h and stored in an air tight container for further defluoridation experiments the activated carbon materials obtained from two different calcination temperatures 250 c and 500 c were labeled as ac clp250 and ac clp500 respectively the steps of adsorbent preparation are discussed in fig 1 2 3 determination of fluoride concentration in solution fluoride solution was prepared by dissolving 224 0 mg of naf in 1000 ml of distilled water and a series of diluted samples were then prepared such that they have working concentrations of 5 10 15 20 and 30 mg l 1 the residual fluoride concentration and ph of the aqueous solution were determined using ion selective electrode method according to the standard methods apha 4500 f c 97 by employing a digital ion meter eutech ion 6 thermo scientific 2 4 characterization of magnetic ac clps zeta nanosizer nano zs90 was used to analyze the particle size distribution of ac clps after dissolving particles in ethanol the particle size of the adsorbent was determined by particle size analyzer to determine the point of zero charge phzpc of the adsorbent the solution ph was adjusted in a range of 2 0 10 0 with intervals of 2 with 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh using a multi parameter water analyzer systonic 371 india singh et al 2011 the surface morphology of the adsorbents was analyzed using sem scanning electron microscopy analysis jsm 6490 lv jeol japan elemental analysis was conducted using the energy dispersive x ray edx analysis fourier transform infrared ftir spectra were recorded using ftir spectrophotometer nicolettm 6700 thermo scientific usa for the identification of functional groups present on the adsorbent surface using kbr as reference material and the spectral range were recorded in the region 400 to 4000 cm 1 x ray diffraction patterns of ac cps were obtained on a powder x ray diffractometer pw 3040 60 panalytical netherlands and the samples were scanned from 10 to 80 at the rate of 2 per min 2 5 adsorption experiments for removal of fluoride by ac clps all the adsorption studies were performed in batch mode at 25 c by varying the initial fluoride concentration from 5 to 30 mg l 1 in each experiment an accurately weighed amount of ac clps was mixed to 25 ml of fluoride solution with a known initial concentration taken in 150 ml capacity of volumetric flask and stirred in a water bath shaker li wbis 20 labard instruchem pvt ltd india at a speed of 120 rpm allowing equilibrium to be achieved at the end of the desired contact time the volumetric flasks were removed from the shaker and filtered through whatman 42 filter paper in order to segregate the solid adsorbent particles the filtrate was then measured by using ion selective electrode method to determine the residual fluoride concentrations adsorption study was conducted to define the basic parameters contact time 30 300 min solution ph 4 10 adsorbent dose 0 5 3 0 g l 1 temperature 25 45 c and initial fluoride concentration 5 30 mg l 1 the experiments were carried out at optimum ph ph 6 6 of the fluoride solution except for the effect of ph variation study data obtained from the tests as mentioned earlier also assisted in investigating the adsorption isotherm i e langmuir and freundlich models as well as its kinetics mechanism through pseudo first order pseudo second order intra particle diffusion and boyd models each test was performed in duplicates in order to diminish the error and the average values were reported here the defluoridation efficacy and equilibrium adsorption capacity were calculated using the following equations 1 removal c 0 c e c 0 100 2 q e mg g 1 c 0 c e v m where c 0 and c e are the initial and equilibrium concentrations of fluoride ions respectively mg l 1 v is the volume of the solution l and m is the adsorbent mass g 3 result and discussion 3 1 characterization of the adsorbents ac clps 3 1 1 particle size analysis and point of zero charge phzpc the particle size of ac clps was determined by homogenizing with ethanol and subsequently analyzed through zeta nanosizer at room temperature particle size data is plotted as shown in fig 2 a ac clp250 peak depicts a higher intensity than ac clp500 as represented in the particle size scattering curve the peak showing the size of particles in the solution was observed in the range of 325 1118 nm for ac clp250 and 249 1278 nm for ac clp500 more extensive range of particles were found in ac clp500 it may be explained that at high temperature biomass was first thermally decomposed into smaller particles and then some particles were clumped into bigger particles after cooling the point of zero charge phzpc of an adsorbent is an important representative that determines the electrical charge behavior of ac clps surfaces fig 2 b reveals that the interpretation between phinitial and δph i e phfinal phinitial are interconnected at ph 2 17 and 4 61 which are represented as phzpc values of the activated carbons ac clp250 and ac clp500 respectively in case of ph phzpc the adsorbent surface charge is positive whereas when ph phzpc the surface charge is negative from the results observed in fig 2 b both the activated carbons seem to have more acid active groups than basic components on their surfaces this might have occurred due to the minimization of acidic groups with the increase in carbonization temperature and accordingly the loss of significant acidic groups such as phenolic carboxylic or lactonic groups are also enhanced moreover the thermal activation contributes to the liberation of acidic metal oxides on the material surfaces tchomgui kamga et al 2010 in contrast the number of basic groups increases with increase in the carbonization temperature for most of the parts the synthesized ac clps are characterized as acidic fig 2 b the phzpc study also signifies that a positive charge behavior in ac clps surface will be favorable for the adsorptive removal of anionic pollutants when the ph values are lower than the phzpc from the results of fig 7 we found that the phzpc increases with increasing carbonization temperature 3 1 2 sem and edx analyses morphological analysis of ac clps was carried out by sem fig 3 the sem images were aimed to distinguish the micrographs obtained from the activation process with two different temperatures 250 c i e ac clp250 and 500 c i e ac clp500 in fig 3 a and c the sem images showed an external surface which is quite uneven and formed by irregular shapes which could not be considered as pores but provide channels to the interior of the material consequently it is assumed to be saturated by the availability of pores of different sizes during the activation process the chemical activator from the synthesized activated carbon experiences the evaporation which further creates the framework of pores uçar et al 2009 the formation of cavities also offered the pathway to the fluoride ions for accessing the pores of the carbon surface moreover the sem images of ac clps explore the cuboidal pyramidal shaped crystal structures due to the cluster formation of fe3o4 particles fig 3 b and d the elemental compositions of prepared ac clps at two different temperatures were examined by edx analysis the quantitative measurements of all the elements present in the sorbent materials are compiled in table 1 after the thermal activation process it is understandable that the residual chlorine contents in both the adsorbents ac clps stimulated from the initial chloride salt i e fecl3 furthermore it can be inferred that the weight percentage of chloride decreases from 21 74 to 13 97 with increase in the carbonization temperature from 250 c to 500 c this chloride loss might be corroborated due to the involvement of drying and carbonization steps most likely as hcl in reality we are unconvinced about the significance of residual chloride for the removal of fluoride ions however more detailed studies are to be carried out to reveal clearer insight 3 1 3 ftir analysis the functional groups on the surface of ac clp250 and ac clp500 were examined by ftir spectra fig 4 a the ftir spectrum of ac clp250 reveals the presence of characteristic peaks at 3383 2902 1619 1442 1249 and 582 cm 1 whereas in case of ac clp500 the predominant peaks at 3422 3032 2876 1618 1441 1217 552 and 468 cm 1 were observed the broad absorption peaks at 3383 cm 1 in case of ac clp250 and 3422 cm 1 in case of ac clp500 were attributed to the availability of surface groups such as phenol carboxylic acids and its derivatives as well as the presence of physically adsorbed water on the material singh et al 2011 in fig 4 a the peaks at 3011 2902 and 2876 cm 1 were attributed to the c h stretching vibrations which further implies that minute quantity of some residual carbon of c limetta exists in ac clps schiewer and balaria 2009 the peaks at 1618 and 1619 cm 1 were assigned to the c o stretching vibration of quinonic and carboxylate groups mondal et al 2019 and the peaks at 1000 1300 cm 1 corresponding to c o stretching vibration of lactonic and phenolic groups present in the ac clp surfaces singh and majumder 2016 next saha et al 2013 reported that the peak at 1440 cm 1 could be attributed to symmetric bending of ch3 groups the peaks in the 400 600 cm 1 range could be attributed to fe o bond vibration of fe3o4 particles sun et al 2006 and conversely the characteristic absorption peak around 630 cm 1 was not observed in the ftir spectra of the ac clp materials which again confirmed the non availability of γ fe2o3 particles fu et al 2008 namduri and nasrazadani 2008 finally it was perceived that the minor shift in the positions of the characteristics peaks after the fluoride adsorption indicate the plausible interaction between the studied active carbons and fluoride ions through oh co c o and fe o functional groups 3 1 4 xrd analysis fig 4 b reveals the xrd patterns for the ac clp250 and ac clp500 carbons in both the cases for the adsorbent the occurrence of board peaks at about 24 was the confirmation of active carbons which have amorphous structure consequently it does not provide quantitative peaks to evaluate the crystallization mode of the ac clps the formation of the cubic spinels was corroborated from the xrd patterns for magnetite by comparing with jcpds file 89 43191 the diffraction peaks located at 220 311 400 422 511 and 440 are recognized the fe3o4 magnetite shen et al 2013 furthermore it can be observed that iron oxide peaks became better delineated and possessed higher intensities when the carbonization temperature is enhanced 3 2 preliminary batch adsorption study to investigate the adsorption potentiality of ac clp250 and ac clp500 for fluoride removal several factors were analyzed the factors include adsorbent dose initial fluoride concentration contact time solution ph and temperature all adsorption experiments were performed at ph 6 6 excluding the effect of ph study simultaneously the best value of the process parameter described above can be considered as the optimized condition the adsorption profile of fluoride removal on the synthesized ac clps is shown in fig 5 the experiment was carried out at 25 c for 240 min by adding 1 0 g l 1 of adsorbent dosage to 25 ml aqueous solution of fluoride ion having an initial concentration of 10 mg l 1 the adsorption of fluoride ions increased with the increase of contact time for both the adsorbents however a saturation of adsorption rate for fluoride removal takes place when the contact time is 240 min the equilibrium percentage removal in ac clp250 for fluoride ions is nearly 61 0 while in case of ac clp500 it is equal to 73 2 consequently ac clp500 exhibited higher fluoride removal percentage than ac clp250 for identical optimized conditions this is because of the greater availability of internal pores in case of active carbon synthesized at 500 c the as prepared activated carbon was expected to be efficient adsorbent for fluoride removal 3 2 1 effect of adsorbent dose on fluoride removal efficacy fig 6 a and b illustrate the influence of adsorbent dose on the percentage removal of fluoride ions by the activated carbons ac clp250 and ac clp500 respectively the effect of adsorbent loading on the removal of fluoride ions by ac clps were carried out at four different adsorbent dosages of 0 5 1 0 2 0 and 3 0 g l 1 while the experimental conditions such as ph 6 6 temperature 25 c initial fluoride concentration 10 mg l 1 remain constant at varying time intervals of 30 60 120 180 240 and 300 min the removal percentage of fluoride by ac clp250 increases from 20 4 to a maximum sorption rate of 65 0 with increasing the adsorbent dose from 0 5 to 1 0 g l 1 while in case of ac clp500 the removal efficacy is increased from 42 1 to 72 9 with increasing the adsorbent dose from 0 5 to 1 0 g l 1 the increase in the removal efficacy with an increase in adsorbent dose is due to the increase in adsorbent mass therefore more number of active sites were available for the defluoridation process next the substantial decrease in removal efficiency after the adsorbent dosage of 1 0 g l 1 might occur due to an increase in particle aggregation experiencing from the excessive sorbent mass consequently it reduces the total availability of sorption sites and also enhances the diffusional path length shukla et al 2002 similarly defluoridation rate also increased with increase in contact time up to 240 min thereafter no significant removal was observed by escalating the contact time fig 6 a and b it is because initially a large number of vacant sorption sites were accessible and after optimum contact period sorption rate slowed down due to plausible monolayer formation on the external surface pores of the sorbent materials and pore diffusion onto the interior surface of the adsorbent the aforesaid observation attained through the adsorbate film layer due to continuous shaking during the present sorption study yadav et al 2013 therefore the adsorbent dosage of 1 0 g l 1 in 240 min was selected as optimum for further fluoride removal studies 3 2 2 effect of initial fluoride ion concentration and contact time the combined influence of initial fluoride ion concentration and contact time for the maximum removal efficacy of fluoride was studied the adsorbent dosage solution ph temperature and shaking speed were fixed at 1 0 g l 1 6 6 25 c and 120 rpm respectively the percentage removal of fluoride was quantified by choosing an initial fluoride ion concentration from 5 mg l 1 to 30 mg l 1 with varying the contact time from 30 min to 300 min the percentage of defluoridation rate decreased with an increase in initial fluoride ion concentration fig 6 c and d this is due to the fact that the number of active sites on the adsorbent surface is not adequate to accommodate the fluoride ions under higher concentration of fluoride in contrast at lower concentration of fluoride the relative proportion of surface active sites to total fluoride is much higher and consequently fluoride ions can interact with the active sites present on the adsorbent surface the maximum removal efficacy of fluoride is found to be 94 7 and 94 8 by employing the adsorbents ac clp250 and ac clp500 respectively with an initial concentration of 5 mg l 1 whereas the percentage removal diminished up to 5 0 and 33 3 in case of 30 mg l 1 of initial fluoride concentration respectively similar observation has been reported for fluoride removal using neem charcoal adsorbent chakrabarty and sarma 2012 therefore ac clp250 and ac clp500 are recognized to be effective adsorbents for fluoride removal under aqueous environment simultaneously fig 6 c and d depict the effect of contact time on fluoride removal efficacy of ac clps it was observed that fluoride removal gradually enhances with an increase in contact time and finally reaches the equilibrium at 240 min i e 4 h after that no significant change in fluoride removal was observed the overall defluoridation process was carried out in three different stages as explored in the aforesaid figures the initial stage revealed the high sorption uptake of fluoride ions onto the ac clps the second stage referred the gradual uptake of fluoride ions illustrating the utilization of all active sites over the surface of prepared adsorbents the third stage signified the saturation stage in which the adsorption uptake was relatively constant similar results were reported earlier by thakre et al 2015 for fluoride removal on chitin based adsorbent hence the optimum equilibrium contact time for subsequent adsorption studies was considered to be 240 min 3 2 3 effect of ph on fluoride removal efficacy the influence of the solution ph on the defluoridation process is one of the important parameter which relates with the active surface sites protonated or deprotonated of the adsorbent material as well as the degree of ionization of the adsorbate in the solution iriel et al 2018 fig 7 shows the effect of ph on the removal percentage of fluoride by ac clps the fluoride adsorption was studied in the ph range of 4 0 10 0 by keeping all the optimized parameters i e fluoride ion concentration 10 mg l 1 contact times of 240 min ac clps dose 1 0 g l 1 and temperature 25 c constant as seen in fig 7 the fluoride removal efficiency of ac clps increased significantly by increasing the ph from 4 0 to 6 6 and then decreased when the ph was further increased up to 10 0 the maximum fluoride removal efficacy was found to be 64 5 and 73 2 at natural ph 6 6 for ac clp250 and ac clp500 respectively moreover the decrease in fluoride removal was observed at highly alkaline ph 10 0 and acidic ph 4 0 conditions which are of no practical significance in real field engineering applications from the experimental data the phzpc values for ac clp250 and ac clp500 are 2 17 and 4 61 respectively fig 2 b the behavior of fluoride adsorption onto ac clps can be described by considering the point of zero charge phzpc of the adsorbent when the ph is lower than phzpc the adsorbent surface was positively charged and when it is higher than phzpc the adsorbent surface is negatively charged thus the defluoridation efficiency reduced for both the activated carbons when ph phzpc this is due to electrostatic repulsion between fluoride ions and negatively charged adsorbent surface and competition between fluoride ions and excess of hydroxyl anions but high removal efficiency of fluoride at ph phzpc is due to electrostatic attraction chen et al 2011 the reduction in fluoride removal under acidic conditions 4 0 6 0 was not only due to the formation of weak hydrofluoric acid but also for the loss of iron oxide from ac clps asgari et al 2012 hence the optimum ph value has been found to be 6 6 and this ph value was used for the following research similar ph profiles have been reported in the adsorption of fluoride onto tea waste supported by hydrous aluminium oxide nanoparticles cai et al 2015 3 2 4 effect of temperature on fluoride removal efficacy the effect of temperature on the adsorption of fluoride ions by the synthesized adsorbents ac clps were explored at three different temperatures 25 35 and 45 c whereas other equilibrium conditions like initial fluoride concentration 10 mg l 1 contact time 240 min ph 6 6 and adsorbent dose 1 0 g l 1 were kept constant hence the defluoridation efficiency is revealed in fig 8 a and b for the activated carbons derived at 250 and 500 c the observation shows that the percentage removal of fluoride increases with increase in temperature the maximum fluoride adsorption of 61 4 and 73 1 were observed at 25 c for the activated carbons ac clp250 and ac clp500 respectively which further enhanced up to 90 7 and 91 3 at 45 c the increasing adsorption trend at high temperature indicates that the defluoridation method is an endothermic process which may be due to the improving binding forces on the adsorbent surface at higher temperature ma et al 2011 according to elhalil et al 2016 it can cause a swelling effect within the internal structure of ac clps as well as increase the mobility of fluoride ions in order to penetrate the fluoride ions further 3 3 modeling of adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherm models were accompanied in order to achieve the adsorption behavior and adsorption capacity for removing a unit mass of fluoride by different ac clps although a variety of isotherm models are available in order to explore the mechanism of the adsorption process nevertheless the langmuir and freundlich isotherm models are the most commonly employed for surface sorption studies hameed and ahmad 2009 in the present work langmuir and freundlich isotherm models were used to elucidate the relationship between the solid phase concentration i e q e mg g 1 and the liquid phase concentration i e c e mg l 1 in this regard ac clps were contacted by increasing the fluoride concentrations from 5 mg l 1 to 30 mg l 1 at optimized conditions of the adsorbent dose of 1 0 g l 1 ph of 6 6 and temperature of 25 c 3 3 1 langmuir isotherm the adsorption capacities of the ac clp250 and ac clp500 corresponding to monolayer adsorption have been estimated by the langmuir model this model is indicative of saturation of binding sites of the adsorbent with negligible interaction among the adsorbed species saturated monolayer isotherm can be represented in eq 3 langmuir 1918 3 c e q e c e q max 1 k l q max where q e is the amount of fluoride ions adsorbed per mass of adsorbent mg g 1 c e is the equilibrium concentration of fluoride ions mg l 1 q max and k l are the langmuir constants related to the adsorption capacity mg g 1 and energy of adsorption l g 1 respectively the value of q max and k l can be obtained using a linear plot in between c e q e versus c e to corroborate whether the defluoridation process was favorable or not a dimensionless constant namely separation factor was employed separation factor r l according to the literature of hameed and ahmad 2009 is expressed in eq 4 4 r l 1 1 k l c 0 where c 0 is the initial fluoride concentration mg l 1 in eq 4 the values of r l can be employed to interpret the adsorption type specified as favorable 0 r l 1 unfavorable r l 1 linear r l 1 and irreversible r l 0 nayak and pal 2017 3 3 2 freundlich isotherm in the stated equation the freundlich isotherm model described the multilayer adsorption behavior of adsorbate molecules on the surface of the adsorbent freundlich 1906 this model assumes that the surface of the adsorbent has a different binding energy spectrum the linear form of the freundlich isotherm equation can be expressed by eq 5 5 log q e log k f 1 n log c e where k f mg g 1 l mg 1 1 n and n are the freundlich isotherm constants and k f is representing the adsorption capacity per unit mass of adsorbent the 1 n value reveals the heterogeneity factor when the value is greater than 1 it signifies the favorable adsorption of adsorbate onto the adsorbent surface the langmuir and freundlich constants with correlation coefficient r 2 values are highlighted in table 2 for both the adsorbents and the linear plots are observed in fig 9 a and b respectively the q e exp was compared with the q e cal obtained from the two isotherm models at 30 mg l 1 of fluoride concentration it is noticed that the values obtained from langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherms have a lower percentage of deviations most importantly in the case of langmuir isotherm the r 2 values are close to unity as compared to the freundlich isotherm hence this describes that the adsorptive behavior of fluoride onto ac clps obeyed the langmuir isotherm it signifies the monolayer coverage of adsorbate over a homogeneous adsorbent surface furthermore the values of n are much higher than unity which also corroborate the favorable adsorption process similarly to present the observation of the adsorption of fluoride onto chemically modified palm kernel shell was better explained by the langmuir model against freundlich isotherm bashir et al 2015 fig 10 reveals the r l values are between 0 and 1 for both the synthesized adsorbents suggesting favorable adsorption conditions by increasing the initial fluoride concentration the r l values diminish progressively due to the superior favorability at high fluoride concentration table 3 illustrates the comparison of the maximum adsorption capacity of fluoride by various biomass related low cost adsorbents with proposed adsorbents employed in this study compared to other adsorbents the performance of ac clps as reported in this study signifies its noteworthy real field applications in this study the adsorbents synthesized from waste c limetta peels explore a remarkable adsorption capacity than many other adsorbents procured till date 3 4 adsorption kinetics and its mechanism in order to examine the rate of adsorption for fluoride onto the ac clps two different kinetic models i e pseudo first order model lagergren 1898 and pseudo second order model ho and mckay 1998 were employed to simulate the experimental data the kinetic study was carried out by varying the contact time from 30 min to 300 min during the defluoridation process the adsorbent dosage solution ph and temperature were fixed at 1 0 g l 1 6 6 and 25 c respectively the validity of the best fit kinetic model was tested against the q e exp q e cal and r 2 values equation 6 illustrates the pseudo first order kinetic model 6 log q e q t log q e k 1 t 2 303 where k 1 represents the reaction rate constant min 1 for the pseudo first order model q e is the adsorption capacity in the equilibrium mg g 1 and q t is the amount of fluoride ions adsorbed at time t min the values of k 1 and q e cal were evaluated from the slopes and intercepts of the linear plots of ln q e q t versus t figure not given respectively and are showed in table 4 table 4 illustrates a disgraceful agreement between q e exp and q e cal values for the fluoride removal the smaller r 2 values for the pseudo first order kinetic model indicates the incompatibility of the pseudo first order model for fluoride adsorption onto the ac clps the pseudo second order kinetic model was further selected based on the equilibrium of the adsorption capacity as expressed in eq 7 7 t q t 1 k 1 q e 2 t q e where k 2 denotes the reaction rate constant g mg 1 min 1 for the pseudo second order kinetic model the values of k 2 and q e cal were calculated from the intercepts and slopes of the plots of t q t versus t fig 11 a and b respectively and are highlighted in table 4 table 4 explores that the correlation coefficient i e r 2 values of adsorption of fluoride ions for the pseudo second order model was higher than that of the pseudo first order model furthermore the adsorption capacity values i e q e cal calculated by the pseudo second order model also possessed a good agreement between experimental values i e q e exp as compared with the pseudo first order model this corroborated that the adsorption process of fluoride onto the ac clps could be considered as a pseudo second order model process which implies that the fluoride uptake process was chemisorption mechanisms moreover the mechanism of the defluoridation process can be described by the intra particle diffusion model weber and morris 1963 which can be explored by eq 8 8 q t k id t 0 5 c where k id represents the intra particle diffusion constant mg g 1 min 0 5 and the intercept c reveals the boundary layer diffusion effects or external film resistance generally the entire adsorption process can be classified into four segments i the adsorbate ions move from the bulk solution to the adsorbent surface by bulk diffusion phenomenon ii film diffusion of the adsorbate ions through the boundary layer in order to reach the external surface of the adsorbent iii intra particle diffusion of the adsorbate ions into an adsorption site by pore diffusion mechanism and iv adsorption takes place onto the active sites of the adsorbent surface while the energy will substantiate on the binding process either due to physical or chemical mechanisms michalak et al 2013 additionally it is also mandatory to understand the step which governs the overall removal rate in the defluoridation process by interpreting the experimental data the first and fourth steps were recognized to be rapid thus it cannot be suggested as the rate limiting step for the defluoridation process the adsorption rate will be monitored by external boundary layer diffusion or by intra particle diffusion or by both to illustrate the effect of intra particle diffusion the plots of q t versus t 0 5 are interpreted if the plot is linear and passing through the origin then it signifies that the entire adsorption process is governed by intra particle diffusion whereas if it does not pass through the origin irrespective of the linear relationship then it explores that the intra particle diffusion is not only the rate controlling step but other mechanisms are also included nayak and pal 2018 fig 11 c and d show that the plots of q t versus t 0 5 for ac clp250 and ac clp500 respectively were multi linear which indicates that more than one rate controlling mechanism affected the fluoride uptake onto the ac clps based on these plots the defluoridation processes of the four steps are encompassed by three phases suggesting that the intra particle diffusion is not only the rate limiting step the initial phase of the plot explored an external mass transfer whereas the second phase reveals a gradual adsorption is mainly due to the intra particle diffusion the last phase is the equilibrium stage in which the intra particle diffusion slows down due to lower availability of the fluoride concentration in the aqueous solution moreover due to the double scenario of intra particle diffusion consisting of both film and intra particle diffusion boyd s model was employed to understand whether the boundary layer film diffusion or the intra particle diffusion controls the adsorption process this model is expressed in eq 9 boyd et al 1947 9 f 1 6 π 2 m 1 1 m 2 exp m 2 b t where f is the fraction of fluoride ions adsorbed at any time t min and b t is mathematical fraction of f the parameter f can be obtained by the following expression 10 f q t q e since it is impossible to evaluate the values of b t for each fraction adsorbed from eq 9 by considering the fourier transform and integration reichenberg 1953 postulated the following expression 11 b t 0 4977 ln 1 f the b t values at different time intervals can be evaluated using eq 11 for various solute fractions the calculated b t values were interpreted against time t the boyd plots are revealed in fig 12 a and b for the adsorption of fluoride ions onto ac clp250 and ac clp500 respectively these boyd plots were employed to distinguish between the controlled mechanisms of the defluoridation process by either boundary layer film diffusion or intra particle diffusion if the plots of b t versus time t are linear and passing through the origin then the actual rate controlling step in the adsorption process is the intra particle pore diffusion otherwise they are governed by external film diffusion nethaji et al 2013 from the above mentioned figures it was observed that the plots were non linear and does not pass through the origin which corroborates that the rate determining step of the defluoridation process was revealed with the combined effects of both boundary layer film diffusion and intra particle pore diffusion 3 5 study of adsorption thermodynamics thermodynamics parameters is responsible for comprehensive information about the spontaneity and heat change of the adsorption process thermodynamics parameters such as gibbs free energy change δg kj mol 1 enthalpy change δh kj mol 1 and entropy change δs j mol 1 k 1 were calculated using the following equation mahmoodi et al 2011 12 k c q e c e 13 δ g rt ln k c 14 ln k c δ s r δ h rt where k c is the distribution constant q e mg g 1 is the amount of fluoride adsorbed on the ac clps at equilibrium c e mg l 1 is the equilibrium concentration in a solution and r 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 is the universal gas constant and t k is the absolute temperature the adsorption experiments were conducted at three different temperatures of 25 35 and 45 c and it was revealed that the removal percentage of fluoride increased with increasing temperature suggesting that the adsorption was more feasible at higher temperature δh and δs values were calculated from the slope and intercept of van t hoff plot of ln k c versus 1 t fig 12 c and obtained thermodynamic parameters were presented in table 5 the negative values of δg indicate the thermodynamically viable and spontaneous nature of the adsorption process by ac clp250 and ac clp500 borah et al 2015 the positive value of δh displays the endothermic nature of adsorption process the magnitude of δh value lies in the range of 2 1 20 9 and 80 200 kj mol 1 for physisorption and chemisorption respectively yu et al 2004 for the present study the δh value was found to be 72 581 and 64 833 kj mol 1 for the studied adsorbents of ac clp250 and ac clp500 respectively this concludes that the adsorption process followed the physico chemical mechanism hence the experimental data reveals that the adsorption of fluoride onto ac clps was favored and blocked at high temperatures the positive values of δs indicate the increased randomness at solid solution interface occurring in the internal structure during the adsorption of fluoride onto ac clp250 and ac clp500 4 conclusion in this study citrus limetta waste peels were employed to synthesize the activated carbons after chemical activation by impregnating with fecl3 the adsorbents obtained from two different carbonization temperatures 250 c and 500 c were assigned as ac clp250 and ac clp500 respectively and the potentiality of the activated carbons were examined for the adsorptive removal of fluoride ions from aqueous solution by increasing the initial fluoride concentration from 5 to 30 mg l 1 the removal efficiency decreased from 94 7 to 5 0 for ac clp250 and 94 8 33 3 for ac clp500 both the activated carbons were equally effective but ac clp250 did not corroborate the significant magnetic property compared to ac clp500 next the adsorption studies were performed as a function of adsorbent dosage initial concentration of fluoride contact time solution ph and temperature for both the adsorbents the removal efficiency was maximum at ph 6 6 almost neutral and decreases significantly on either side of ph 6 6 which would be appropriate for real field purification system the adsorption kinetics was found to follow the pseudo second order model whereas the adsorption isotherm followed the langmuir isotherm with high r 2 values ac clp250 0 9964 and ac clp500 0 9776 the maximum monolayer capacity obtained using the langmuir isotherm for ac clp250 and ac clp500 were 4 926 and 9 709 mg g 1 under the optimum conditions of adsorbent dosage 1 0 g l 1 contact time 240 min and temperature 25 c with fluoride concentration ranging from 5 to 30 mg l 1 the rate determining step of the defluoridation process was corroborated by both external film layer diffusion and intra particle diffusion mechanisms thermodynamic parameters were computed for the removal of fluoride and their values evoked that the defluoridation process was endothermic and spontaneous in the studied temperature range finally it could be concluded that ac clp can be effectively utilized for the adsorptive removal of fluoride ions from the aqueous environment acknowledgement facilities provided by

12189,this study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of integrating photo oxidation process based on uv persulfate and adsorption on arsenic as removal from aqueous environments the effects of different parameters were studied on a laboratory scale by means of a cylindrical reactor containing a uv c lamp 15 w after passing the oxidized samples from the adsorption column the oxidation and arsenic removal rates were measured using uv visible spectrophotometer and inductively coupled plasma icp respectively response surface methodology rsm based on box behnken design was applied to evaluate the effect of independent variables on the arsenic oxidation efficiency the highest as removal efficiency 96 was obtained in the oxidation phase under optimum ph 3 initial as concentration of 0 5 mg l 1

greatly increase the as oxidation efficiency this process has two advantages transformation of toxic and dangerous form of arsenic into its low risk one and better removal of as v than the conventional filtration methods graphical abstract image 1 keywords persulfate oxidation ultraviolet radiation adsorption arsenic 1 introduction groundwater is the primary source of drinking and domestic water in many parts of the world mainly owing to its general availability and higher quality than the surface water coyte et al 2019 gholizadeh et al 2017b nevertheless existence of some micro pollutants such as arsenic in groundwater has raised controversies regarding its consumption chakraborti et al 2016 arsenic as is the twentieth most abundant element on earth crust and considered as a significant worldwide groundwater pollutant kobya et al 2020 this toxic metalloid can enter the human body through polluted water air soils and consumption of many agricultural crops irrigated by as contaminated groundwater chakraborti et al 2015 marcotte et al 2017 zeng et al 2020 many previous studies documented detrimental effects of as on humans abdul et al 2015 singh et al 2015 animals sankar et al 2016 insects hepp et al 2017 and plants kowalczyk and latowski 2018 according to roychowdhury 2010 as contaminated water resources influence over 500 million people around the world with over 100 million people living just in the bengal delta the most frequent form of as is arsenite as iii which is most commonly found in groundwater resources nidheesh et al 2018 shakoor

epa 2000 ultrafiltration hao et al 2018 and microbial based technologies gholizadeh et al 2017a malakootian et al 2018 however it is advisable to convert as iii to as v by chemical oxidation in the pre treatment phase to improve the overall removal efficiency ahoranta et al 2016 nidheesh and singh 2017 oxidation and subsequent removal of some toxic impurities from aqueous environments via

this method enjoys from different advantages including lower cost higher stability of produced radical in various conditions better solubility and less dependence on organic matters greater destruction ability and easier maintenance portability kang et al 2016 however persulfate in water has a weak oxidation power while used individually therefore if persulfate is activated by chemical or thermal methods sulfate free radicals image 2 would be produced which are about 1000 10 000 times stronger in degrading pollutants than the persulfate ion xiao et al 2018 equation 1 shows activation of the persulfate by uv c jing et al 2011 shih et al 2012 1 the pollutants remaining from the oxidation process can be eliminated by a simple process such as adsorption which enjoys from flexibility in design and utilization and can produce a high quality output dehdashti et al 2019 the most applicable efficient adsorbent widely used to remove environmental pollution is activated carbon jabraoui et al 2019 in the light of these contemplations this study aimed to evaluate the performances of photo oxidation based on uv persulfate and subsequently on activated carbon column in removing as from aquatic environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents in this experimental study all used chemicals were labeled with laboratory grades and were purchased from merck without further purification stock solution of as iii 100 ppm was created from sodium arsenite naaso2 and different concentrations were synthetically adjusted by adding distinct amounts of stock solution in deionized water a granular activated carbon gac jacobi carbons inc sweden was used in this work table 1 represents specifications of gac applied in this study to prepare adsorbent and enhance adsorption capacity carbon was initially immersed in a 5 sodium hydroxide solution for 3 h and then washed several times with distilled water tan et al 2014 next it was dried in 110 c for 2 h and 30 min and kept in the desiccator until usage 2 2 photo oxidation reactor and adsorption column a plexiglas tube reactor with an approximate volume of 4 l and a uv c lamp 15 w was used to do the experiments in a batch manner see fig 1 a mechanical mixer was used to keep solution homogeneous a polyethylene adsorption column with inner diameter of 6 5 cm and length of 40 cm was used as the adsorption column in order to have a uniform liquid distribution the top and the bottom zones were packed with glass beads and kept by compressed plastic nets to prevent sample outpouring 5 cm from the bottom and 5 cm from the top sections were retained empty hence 30 cm of column depth remained as the effective adsorption bed which was filled with 200 g of the treated gac 2 3 response surface methodology rsm response surface methodology rsm based on the box behnken design was utilized in mini tab 17 to evaluate the effects of independent variables on the response variable oxidation efficiency and also to predict the best response value aliyu 2019 independent variables of the study were x1 primary concentration of as 0 1 0 9 mg l 1 x2 ph 3 7 and 11 and x3 the persulfate potassium concentration 4 14 mm l 1 used at three levels minimum 1 moderate 0 and maximum 1 this includes three factors and five central points for estimating the overall error a total number of 45 experiments were conducted based on box behnken designing method each experiment was repeated twice the design method data was used to determine suitability of the quadratic polynomial regression equations subsequently the effects of initial persulfate concentration ph and different concentrations of as on its oxidation were examined and optimized equation 2 was derived from rsm method showing the experimental relationship between variables of the experiment and as efficiency percentage y 2 y 70 5 2 9 x 1 18 7 x 2 25 x 1 2 9 x 2 2 5 6 x 1 x 2 where x 1 and x 2 are the initial concentrations of as mg l 1 and k2s2o8 concentration respectively in order to determine quality of the polynomial model r2 and adjusted r2 were used 2 4 procedure according to the rsm output see table 2 1 l of a solution containing as iii was introduced into the uv reactor by adjusting ph 3 7 and 11 and concentration of persulfate solution 4 9 14 mg l 1 the initial concentrations of as iii were 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 mg l 1 which are representative of raw water and wastewater contaminated with arsenic respectively bissen et al 2001 later the best conditions for each studied variable were determined in terms of providing the highest oxidation efficiency of as iii to as v at this stage the control included a reactor with all the same features as the original reactor but without a uv lamp experiments were conducted twice in order to determine the results repeatability in adsorption column distilled water was first passed through the bed for 30 min in order to reduce the possible errors caused by blocking or canalization of the bed after distilled water was completely removed from the bed a sample was passed through the column after complete drainage of the distilled water the influent that contained the rest target contaminant from oxidation step was pumped downward by a dosing pump in the adsorption process the effect of different phs 5 5 6 5 and 7 5 was initially examined to investigate the effect of contact time on as removal the effluent with optimum ph was injected into the column at 5 10 2 04 and 1 27 ml min 1 to meet the empty bed contact times of 30 75 and 120 min respectively the effective parameters on the adsorption process and ph 5 5 6 5 and 7 5 were optimized all experiments were performed at the ambient temperature 20 25 c 2 5 analyses and measurements the amount of as v in samples was measured using the molybdate colorimetric method and by means of a uv visible spectrophotometer dr6000 hach usa at 193 7 nm after preparing the reagents according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater rice et al 2012 1 ml of the ascorbic acid solution and 2 ml of the reagent were successively added to 40 ml of sample aliquot in a 50 ml volumetric flask the rest volume was completed by de ionized water the control solution was prepared by adding the same amounts of ascorbic acid reagent to distilled water absorption values obtained from the device were plotted in standard curves and the final concentration in the effluent was obtained an inductively coupled plasma spectrometry icp device avio 200 perkinelmer usa was used to measure the total as value the statistical method of analysis of variance anova was run for describing the response results by spss v 20 an equilibrium isotherm describes the relationship between adsorbate concentration and adsorbent capacity at a constant temperature here freundlich langmuir and temkin isotherms were employed to evaluate the experimental data the non linear expressions of used isotherm models are given in equations 3 5 alahabadi et al 2016 3 lanumuir q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 4 freundlich q e k f c e 1 n 5 temkin q e q m ln k t c e the constants of kl kf and kt are related to langmuir freundlich and temkin models respectively moreover 1 n is the freundlich constant associated to adsorption intensity and qm mg g 1 is the maximum theoretical adsorption capacity of the adsorbent furthermore rl that is a dimensionless separation factor in the langmuir model was calculated as 6 r l 1 1 k l c 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 the effect of ph many studies confirmed that ph parameter plays an effective role in the oxidation process in our study after adjusting the ph adding a specified amount of k2s2o8 and exposing the solution to uv light the amounts of as v were ultimately determined the first step of this study contained determination of the optimal ph for better oxidation of as iii to as v the results are summarized in fig 2 in terms of the as oxidation decrease of ph increased the oxidation efficiency within the uv k2s2o8 process the highest oxidation efficiency 96 was observed at ph 3 increased ph values decreased the oxidation down to 20 at ph 1 these results show that the ph level of the environment affects the reaction speed and oxidation of as drastically it has been well recognized that the persulfate anion can be activated to generate image 4 as shown in equations 7 and 8 an et al 2015 furthermore the presence of image 4 in aqueous solution can result in producing hydroxyl radical oh hazime et al 2014 under acidic conditions the breakdown of persulfate into sulfate free radicals can be further acid catalyzed as shown in equations 7 and 8 in a study by hussain et al 2017 the oxidation amount of as increased by decrease of the ph levels which is in line with the findings of our study wang and liang 2014 found that the high tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide removal efficiency in acidic ph was due to dominance of the radical persulfate in an acidic environment 7 s 2 o 8 2 h h s 2 o 8 8 3 2 effect of different as concentrations the results of different as concentrations on oxidation efficiency during k2s2o8 contact and uv irradiation are represented in fig 3 in the presence of k2s2o8 and uv the oxidation of as iii to as v was fast furthermore an increase in the as iii concentration enhanced the oxidation in 0 5 mg l 1 and ph 3 with the removal efficiency of 96 whereas the removal efficiency lowered to 80 in 0 1 mg l 1 3 3 effect of s2o8 concentration for this purpose different s2 o8 concentrations 4 9 and 14 mm l 1 were injected into the reactor at as concentration of 0 5 mg l 1 the results are illustrated in fig 4 analyses revealed that increase in s2o8 concentration up to a certain extent was accompanied by enhanced as oxidation however the maximum oxidation efficiency was observed in 4 mm s2o8 concentration while higher concentrations did not have remarkable effects on removal efficiency by increasing the s2o8 dose an excessive sulfate ion was produced which acted as a radical scavenger and reacted according to the equilibrium equations for converting radical sulfate to persulfate radical sulfate reacted with the target pollutant and turned it into new products it also could produce more active radical hydroxyl during other chain reactions which in turn could destroy the pollutants poblete et al 2019 ding et al 2016 mentioned that complete domination of the activated oxidant places occurred at high concentration levels of arsenate hence an increase in arsenate concentration can increase the oxidation efficiency which is in agreement with the results of this study the controls showed less as oxidation 73 5 at the best conditions than the main samples a possible explanation for this result is that uv can promote formation of the hydroxyl radicals that immediately react with persulfate an et al 2015 the persulfate activation by uv can be attributed to a combination of two different radical reactions sulfate and hydroxyl radicals oh guifang et al 2012 the sulfate radical is produced by persulfate according to the following equations 9 and 10 9 10 3 4 statistical analyses the statistical method of anova was employed for the response analysis the high linear regression coefficient for as oxidation by persulfate r2 0 934 and r2 adjusted 0 917 showed that the model worked and predicted appropriately therefore as r2 reaches 1 the model has more ability to explain the changes in responses as a function of independent variables table 3 accordingly the oxidation of as by uv k2s2o8 process is well described by the model moreover the effect of all studied parameters except persulfate was significant on as oxidation efficiency p 0 05 distributional of the experiment data compared to the predicted amounts of the model are depicted in fig 5 no deviation is observed in the residues normality according to fig 5a fig 5b illustrates the residues dispersion in proportion to the fitting values in order to determine the variance stability since no sign of the increasing or decreasing trends is observed in the variance the stability of variance hypothesis is confirmed fig 5c shows the residues changes through a histogram the curving style indicates that the data are normally distributed fig 5d represents the residues dispersion in proportion to the data collection times showing the residues independence no trends exist in the graph rejecting the residues independence therefore the data are independent to time consequently given the results of the graph and acceptance of the hypotheses the response surface model based on box behnken design is appropriate for data analysis 3 5 adsorption process after as iii passed through the first advanced oxidation process aop as v was identified as the eventual arsenic product for degradation which could be efficiently removed by readily available adsorption onto gac since the as v adsorption onto the gac is closely related to the solution ph a series of experiments were carried out in ph range of 5 5 7 5 to determine the optimum ph in the adsorption process samples extracted from the photochemical oxidation were adjusted at different phs while they were subjected to a constant 30 min of contact time accordingly the optimum ph equal to 6 5 was achieved for as v adsorption from photochemical oxidation reactor which is the typical ph range of the surface water the high removal efficiency of as v ascribed the electrostatic gravity between haso 4 2 and gac at this ph sun et al 2018 zeng et al 2020 considering the inner sphere complexation the removal efficiency decreased slightly with a ph of higher than 6 5 however in alkaline conditions gac was negatively charged and as v existed more negatively charged anion species haso 4 2 and aso 4 3 the electrostatic repulsion aggravated and the potential competition emerged between arsenic species and hydroxyl at a higher ph martinson and reddy 2009 both these processes decreased the as v adsorption dramatically at phs below 5 the concentration of h ions is high in the environment which results in a positive charge level of adsorbent the competition between h ions and metal ions on the adsorbent surface as well as the repulsion of metallic ions and solids with positive charge reduce the adsorption efficiency oh et al 2019 with regard to the contact time the removal rate of as in adsorption bed rose up after 30 min reached its maximum removal efficiency 99 at 75 min and decreased subsequently this can be attributed to the presence of abundant unsaturated active sites on the outer surfaces of gac at the beginning adsorption phase dehdashti et al 2019 gholizadeh et al 2013 therefore the time of 75 min was selected as the optimum adsorption time in adsorbent bed 3 5 1 isotherm modeling langmuir isotherm is valid for a surface adsorption with a finite number of identical sites while data fitting with the freundlich isotherm represent heterogeneous and multi layer adsorption gholizadeh et al 2013 described modeling of adsorption data in the langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherms the results showed that langmuir isotherm r2 0 97 could better explain the adsorption of as v onto adsorbent surface than isotherm models of freundlich r2 0 67 and temkin r2 0 66 the kl and qm constants were equal to 0 004 l mg 1 and 6 52 mg g 1 respectively furthermore the separation factor r l 1 1 k c 0 was equal to 0 99 that shows the model appropriateness and feasibility in the langmuir isotherm the absorbent is assumed to interact only with a limited number of uniform adsorption sites and adsorption is limited to only one single layer on the surface therefore the same energy and enthalpy will exist for all ions of a solution in the adsorption process dehdashti et al 2019 these our results are compatible with the findings of chuang et al 2005 and tan et al 2008 4 conclusion consumption of the as contaminated drinking water for a long time has harmful effects on human being health in the as removal process the main concern is to deal with this questions is the treatment method capable of removing as effectively and economically as defined by the environmental guidelines in this study the toxic and dangerous form of as i e as iii was turned into as v using uv k2s2o8 and then treated on activated carbon therefore according to the results the photo oxidation process along with the activated carbon adsorption is an economical practical and efficient process in as removal from aqueous environment in the case that we control the effective parameters on the removal process this method can be used for treating high contaminated water with as and reach the drinking water standards acknowledgment this study was conducted in cooperation with the environmental health department in shahid sadoughi university of medical sciences id ir ssu sph rec 1395 135

et al 2019 in comparison with as v as iii has many deleterious impacts on human beings such as skin lacerations keratosis and pigmentation different types of cancer e g skin lung and liver cancers and black foot diseases adlnasab et al 2019 uppal et al 2019 high concentrations of as have been reported in water resources of some east and southeast countries of asia bangladesh thailand iran and malaysia as well as chile argentina and the west part of the united states us medpelli et al 2015 phung et al 2017 based on the world health organization who recommendations the allowed level of as concentration in drinking water is 10 μg l 1 similarly the us environmental protection agency epa has recently lowered the maximum allowable concentration mcl of as in drinking water from 50 to 10 μg l 1 lata and samadder 2016 some of the best accessible technologies for as removal include adsorption onto activated alumina shakoor et al 2019 forward osmosis oxidation filtration ion exchange u s epa 2000 ultrafiltration hao et al 2018 and microbial based technologies gholizadeh et al 2017a malakootian et al 2018 however it is advisable to convert as iii to as v by chemical oxidation in the pre treatment phase to improve the overall removal efficiency ahoranta et al 2016 nidheesh and singh 2017 oxidation and subsequent removal of some toxic impurities from aqueous environments via persulfate s 2 o 8 2 oxidation reduction potential orp 2 01 v have grabbed the attention of researchers during the last few years ike et al 2018 law et al 2018 matzek and carter 2016 sizykh et al 2018 this method enjoys from different advantages including lower cost higher stability of produced radical in various conditions better solubility and less dependence on organic matters greater destruction ability and easier maintenance portability kang et al 2016 however persulfate in water has a weak oxidation power while used individually therefore if persulfate is activated by chemical or thermal methods sulfate free radicals image 2 would be produced which are about 1000 10 000 times stronger in degrading pollutants than the persulfate ion xiao et al 2018 equation 1 shows activation of the persulfate by uv c jing et al 2011 shih et al 2012 1 the pollutants remaining from the oxidation process can be eliminated by a simple process such as adsorption which enjoys from flexibility in design and utilization and can produce a high quality output dehdashti et al 2019 the most applicable efficient adsorbent widely used to remove environmental pollution is activated carbon jabraoui et al 2019 in the light of these contemplations this study aimed to evaluate the performances of photo oxidation based on uv persulfate and subsequently on activated carbon column in removing as from aquatic environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents in this experimental study all used chemicals were labeled with laboratory grades and were purchased from merck without further purification stock solution of as iii 100 ppm was created from sodium arsenite naaso2 and different concentrations were synthetically adjusted by adding distinct amounts of stock solution in deionized water a granular activated carbon gac jacobi carbons inc sweden was used in this work table 1 represents specifications of gac applied in this study to prepare adsorbent and enhance adsorption capacity carbon was initially immersed in a 5 sodium hydroxide solution for 3 h and then washed several times with distilled water tan et al 2014 next it was dried in 110 c for 2 h and 30 min and kept in the desiccator until usage 2 2 photo oxidation reactor and adsorption column a plexiglas tube reactor with an approximate volume of 4 l and a uv c lamp 15 w was used to do the experiments in a batch manner see fig 1 a mechanical mixer was used to keep solution homogeneous a polyethylene adsorption column with inner diameter of 6 5 cm and length of 40 cm was used as the adsorption column in order to have a uniform liquid distribution the top and the bottom zones were packed with glass beads and kept by compressed plastic nets to prevent sample outpouring 5 cm from the bottom and 5 cm from the top sections were retained empty hence 30 cm of column depth remained as the effective adsorption bed which was filled with 200 g of the treated gac 2 3 response surface methodology rsm response surface methodology rsm based on the box behnken design was utilized in mini tab 17 to evaluate the effects of independent variables on the response variable oxidation efficiency and also to predict the best response value aliyu 2019 independent variables of the study were x1 primary concentration of as 0 1 0 9 mg l 1 x2 ph 3 7 and 11 and x3 the persulfate potassium concentration 4 14 mm l 1 used at three levels minimum 1 moderate 0 and maximum 1 this includes three factors and five central points for estimating the overall error a total number of 45 experiments were conducted based on box behnken designing method each experiment was repeated twice the design method data was used to determine suitability of the quadratic polynomial regression equations subsequently the effects of initial persulfate concentration ph and different concentrations of as on its oxidation were examined and optimized equation 2 was derived from rsm method showing the experimental relationship between variables of the experiment and as efficiency percentage y 2 y 70 5 2 9 x 1 18 7 x 2 25 x 1 2 9 x 2 2 5 6 x 1 x 2 where x 1 and x 2 are the initial concentrations of as mg l 1 and k2s2o8 concentration respectively in order to determine quality of the polynomial model r2 and adjusted r2 were used 2 4 procedure according to the rsm output see table 2 1 l of a solution containing as iii was introduced into the uv reactor by adjusting ph 3 7 and 11 and concentration of persulfate solution 4 9 14 mg l 1 the initial concentrations of as iii were 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 mg l 1 which are representative of raw water and wastewater contaminated with arsenic respectively bissen et al 2001 later the best conditions for each studied variable were determined in terms of providing the highest oxidation efficiency of as iii to as v at this stage the control included a reactor with all the same features as the original reactor but without a uv lamp experiments were conducted twice in order to determine the results repeatability in adsorption column distilled water was first passed through the bed for 30 min in order to reduce the possible errors caused by blocking or canalization of the bed after distilled water was completely removed from the bed a sample was passed through the column after complete drainage of the distilled water the influent that contained the rest target contaminant from oxidation step was pumped downward by a dosing pump in the adsorption process the effect of different phs 5 5 6 5 and 7 5 was initially examined to investigate the effect of contact time on as removal the effluent with optimum ph was injected into the column at 5 10 2 04 and 1 27 ml min 1 to meet the empty bed contact times of 30 75 and 120 min respectively the effective parameters on the adsorption process and ph 5 5 6 5 and 7 5 were optimized all experiments were performed at the ambient temperature 20 25 c 2 5 analyses and measurements the amount of as v in samples was measured using the molybdate colorimetric method and by means of a uv visible spectrophotometer dr6000 hach usa at 193 7 nm after preparing the reagents according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater rice et al 2012 1 ml of the ascorbic acid solution and 2 ml of the reagent were successively added to 40 ml of sample aliquot in a 50 ml volumetric flask the rest volume was completed by de ionized water the control solution was prepared by adding the same amounts of ascorbic acid reagent to distilled water absorption values obtained from the device were plotted in standard curves and the final concentration in the effluent was obtained an inductively coupled plasma spectrometry icp device avio 200 perkinelmer usa was used to measure the total as value the statistical method of analysis of variance anova was run for describing the response results by spss v 20 an equilibrium isotherm describes the relationship between adsorbate concentration and adsorbent capacity at a constant temperature here freundlich langmuir and temkin isotherms were employed to evaluate the experimental data the non linear expressions of used isotherm models are given in equations 3 5 alahabadi et al 2016 3 lanumuir q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 4 freundlich q e k f c e 1 n 5 temkin q e q m ln k t c e the constants of kl kf and kt are related to langmuir freundlich and temkin models respectively moreover 1 n is the freundlich constant associated to adsorption intensity and qm mg g 1 is the maximum theoretical adsorption capacity of the adsorbent furthermore rl that is a dimensionless separation factor in the langmuir model was calculated as 6 r l 1 1 k l c 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 the effect of ph many studies confirmed that ph parameter plays an effective role in the oxidation process in our study after adjusting the ph adding a specified amount of k2s2o8 and exposing the solution to uv light the amounts of as v were ultimately determined the first step of this study contained determination of the optimal ph for better oxidation of as iii to as v the results are summarized in fig 2 in terms of the as oxidation decrease of ph increased the oxidation efficiency within the uv k2s2o8 process the highest oxidation efficiency 96 was observed at ph 3 increased ph values decreased the oxidation down to 20 at ph 1 these results show that the ph level of the environment affects the reaction speed and oxidation of as drastically it has been well recognized that the persulfate anion can be activated to generate image 4 as shown in equations 7 and 8 an et al 2015 furthermore the presence of image 4 in aqueous solution can result in producing hydroxyl radical oh hazime et al 2014 under acidic conditions the breakdown of persulfate into sulfate free radicals can be further acid catalyzed as shown in equations 7 and 8 in a study by hussain et al 2017 the oxidation amount of as increased by decrease of the ph levels which is in line with the findings of our study wang and liang 2014 found that the high tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide removal efficiency in acidic ph was due to dominance of the radical persulfate in an acidic environment 7 s 2 o 8 2 h h s 2 o 8 8 3 2 effect of different as concentrations the results of different as concentrations on oxidation efficiency during k2s2o8 contact and uv irradiation are represented in fig 3 in the presence of k2s2o8 and uv the oxidation of as iii to as v was fast furthermore an increase in the as iii concentration enhanced the oxidation in 0 5 mg l 1 and ph 3 with the removal efficiency of 96 whereas the removal efficiency lowered to 80 in 0 1 mg l 1 3 3 effect of s2o8 concentration for this purpose different s2 o8 concentrations 4 9 and 14 mm l 1 were injected into the reactor at as concentration of 0 5 mg l 1 the results are illustrated in fig 4 analyses revealed that increase in s2o8 concentration up to a certain extent was accompanied by enhanced as oxidation however the maximum oxidation efficiency was observed in 4 mm s2o8 concentration while higher concentrations did not have remarkable effects on removal efficiency by increasing the s2o8 dose an excessive sulfate ion was produced which acted as a radical scavenger and reacted according to the equilibrium equations for converting radical sulfate to persulfate radical sulfate reacted with the target pollutant and turned it into new products it also could produce more active radical hydroxyl during other chain reactions which in turn could destroy the pollutants poblete et al 2019 ding et al 2016 mentioned that complete domination of the activated oxidant places occurred at high concentration levels of arsenate hence an increase in arsenate concentration can increase the oxidation efficiency which is in agreement with the results of this study the controls showed less as oxidation 73 5 at the best conditions than the main samples a possible explanation for this result is that uv can promote formation of the hydroxyl radicals that immediately react with persulfate an et al 2015 the persulfate activation by uv can be attributed to a combination of two different radical reactions sulfate and hydroxyl radicals oh guifang et al 2012 the sulfate radical is produced by persulfate according to the following equations 9 and 10 9 10 3 4 statistical analyses the statistical method of anova was employed for the response analysis the high linear regression coefficient for as oxidation by persulfate r2 0 934 and r2 adjusted 0 917 showed that the model worked and predicted appropriately therefore as r2 reaches 1 the model has more ability to explain the changes in responses as a function of independent variables table 3 accordingly the oxidation of as by uv k2s2o8 process is well described by the model moreover the effect of all studied parameters except persulfate was significant on as oxidation efficiency p 0 05 distributional of the experiment data compared to the predicted amounts of the model are depicted in fig 5 no deviation is observed in the residues normality according to fig 5a fig 5b illustrates the residues dispersion in proportion to the fitting values in order to determine the variance stability since no sign of the increasing or decreasing trends is observed in the variance the stability of variance hypothesis is confirmed fig 5c shows the residues changes through a histogram the curving style indicates that the data are normally distributed fig 5d represents the residues dispersion in proportion to the data collection times showing the residues independence no trends exist in the graph rejecting the residues independence therefore the data are independent to time consequently given the results of the graph and acceptance of the hypotheses the response surface model based on box behnken design is appropriate for data analysis 3 5 adsorption process after as iii passed through the first advanced oxidation process aop as v was identified as the eventual arsenic product for degradation which could be efficiently removed by readily available adsorption onto gac since the as v adsorption onto the gac is closely related to the solution ph a series of experiments were carried out in ph range of 5 5 7 5 to determine the optimum ph in the adsorption process samples extracted from the photochemical oxidation were adjusted at different phs while they were subjected to a constant 30 min of contact time accordingly the optimum ph equal to 6 5 was achieved for as v adsorption from photochemical oxidation reactor which is the typical ph range of the surface water the high removal efficiency of as v ascribed the electrostatic gravity between haso 4 2 and gac at this ph sun et al 2018 zeng et al 2020 considering the inner sphere complexation the removal efficiency decreased slightly with a ph of higher than 6 5 however in alkaline conditions gac was negatively charged and as v existed more negatively charged anion species haso 4 2 and aso 4 3 the electrostatic repulsion aggravated and the potential competition emerged between arsenic species and hydroxyl at a higher ph martinson and reddy 2009 both these processes decreased the as v adsorption dramatically at phs below 5 the concentration of h ions is high in the environment which results in a positive charge level of adsorbent the competition between h ions and metal ions on the adsorbent surface as well as the repulsion of metallic ions and solids with positive charge reduce the adsorption efficiency oh et al 2019 with regard to the contact time the removal rate of as in adsorption bed rose up after 30 min reached its maximum removal efficiency 99 at 75 min and decreased subsequently this can be attributed to the presence of abundant unsaturated active sites on the outer surfaces of gac at the beginning adsorption phase dehdashti et al 2019 gholizadeh et al 2013 therefore the time of 75 min was selected as the optimum adsorption time in adsorbent bed 3 5 1 isotherm modeling langmuir isotherm is valid for a surface adsorption with a finite number of identical sites while data fitting with the freundlich isotherm represent heterogeneous and multi layer adsorption gholizadeh et al 2013 described modeling of adsorption data in the langmuir freundlich and temkin isotherms the results showed that langmuir isotherm r2 0 97 could better explain the adsorption of as v onto adsorbent surface than isotherm models of freundlich r2 0 67 and temkin r2 0 66 the kl and qm constants were equal to 0 004 l mg 1 and 6 52 mg g 1 respectively furthermore the separation factor r l 1 1 k c 0 was equal to 0 99 that shows the model appropriateness and feasibility in the langmuir isotherm the absorbent is assumed to interact only with a limited number of uniform adsorption sites and adsorption is limited to only one single layer on the surface therefore the same energy and enthalpy will exist for all ions of a solution in the adsorption process dehdashti et al 2019 these our results are compatible with the findings of chuang et al 2005 and tan et al 2008 4 conclusion consumption of the as contaminated drinking water for a long time has harmful effects on human being health in the as removal process the main concern is to deal with this questions is the treatment method capable of removing as effectively and economically as defined by the environmental guidelines in this study the toxic and dangerous form of as i e as iii was turned into as v using uv k2s2o8 and then treated on activated carbon therefore according to the results the photo oxidation process along with the activated carbon adsorption is an economical practical and efficient process in as removal from aqueous environment in the case that we control the effective parameters on the removal process this method can be used for treating high contaminated water with as and reach the drinking water standards acknowledgment this study was conducted in cooperation with the environmental health department in shahid sadoughi university of medical sciences id ir ssu sph rec 1395 135
