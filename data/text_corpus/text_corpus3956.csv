19780,comprehensive insights into the sludge digestate dewaterability were gained through porous network structure of sludge we measured the evolution of digestate dewaterability represented by the solid content of centrifugally dewatered cake in high solids sequencing batch digesters with and without thermal hydrolysis pretreatment thp the results show that the dewaterability of the sludge after digestion was improved by 3 5 0 5 for unpretreated sludge and 5 1 0 4 for thermally hydrolyzed sludge compared to the unpretreated sludge digestate thermal hydrolysis pretreatment eventually resulted in an improvement of dewaterability by 4 6 0 5 smaller particle size and larger surface area of sludge were induced by thermal hydrolysis and anaerobic digestion treatments the structure strength and compactness of sludge represented by elastic modulus and fractal dimension respectively decreased with increase of digestion time the porous network structure was broken up by thermal hydrolysis pretreatment and was further weakened during anaerobic digestion which correspondingly improved the dewaterability of digestates the logarithm of elastic modulus increased linearly with fractal dimension regardless of the pretreatment both fractal dimension and elastic modulus showed linear relationship with dewaterability the rheological characterization combined with the analysis of fractal dimension of sewage sludge porous network structure was found applicable in quantitative evaluation of sludge dewaterability which depended positively on both thermal hydrolysis and anaerobic digestion graphical abstract image 1 keywords dewaterability structure strength fractal dimension thermal hydrolysis anaerobic digestion 1 introduction large quantities of excess sludge are generated as a by product of biological wastewater treatment processes anaerobic digestion which can stabilize organic substances while simultaneously generating valuable the energy resource biogas is a sustainable treatment technology for sewage sludge foladori et al 2010 the dewaterability of digestate needs to be improved to allow better quality disposal such as incineration and land use kepp et al 2000 recently high solids anaerobic digestion with total solids inputs of over 10 has been widely implemented on mechanically dewater sludge because of the advantages of higher organic loading rates and lower heating energy requirements than conventional low solids anaerobic digestion processes guendouz et al 2008 number of pretreatment approaches have been devised for increasing the digestion efficiency by promoting hydrolysis stage of anaerobic digestion including thermal hydrolysis ultrasound enzymatic electrochemical microwave fenton alkali and many others anjum et al 2016 these pretreatments were also demonstrated increasing the dewaterability of sludge and improving the fluidity within digesters khanal et al 2007 mahmoud et al 2013 pilli et al 2015 dewaterability is defined in terms of capillary suction time cst in many studies for the conventional low solids anaerobic digestion systems without pretreatment processes the dewaterability of digestate was found deteriorating with the process continued houghton et al 2000 ye et al 2014 while li and yang 2007 xu et al 2009 reported the dewaterability was improved other researchers have also found that the level of dewaterability during anaerobic digestion was not stable it improved at first and then deteriorated kopp et al 1997 deteriorated at first and then improved miron et al 2000 or maintained roughly constant jensen et al 2014 when a pretreatment such as ultrasonic or thermal hydrolysis was applied to the anaerobic digestion the dewaterability of digestate was agreeable to be improved shao et al 2010 xu et al 2011 kepp et al 2000 oosterhuis et al 2014 although differences in composition and distribution of extracellular polymeric substances eps have been used to explain the variation of sludge dewaterability results have shown contradictions among different processes eps are main high molecular weight secretions from microorganisms products of cellular lysis hydrolytes of macromolecules and sorptions from the environment sheng et al 2010 performing critical roles in holding huge quantities of bound water by chemical hydration crystallization adsorption vaxelaire and cezac 2004 and osmotic effect skinner et al 2015 digestate dewaterability decreased with an increase of soluble eps dai et al 2017 li and yang 2007 novak et al 2003 shao et al 2010 as the macromolecular components in eps can cause difficulties in dewatering raszka et al 2006 however when a pretreatment such as thermal hydrolysis or ultrasonic is implemented the dewaterability of digestate increased with an enhancement of eps solubilization which was further explained by the release of partially bound water achieved from eps solubilization neyens et al 2004 ruiz hernando et al 2013 the above contradictory results show that only the analysis of eps content is limited to understand the variations of digestate dewaterability in different treatment processes in addition it is worth mentioning that the complicated compositions of eps different eps extraction methods and perhaps incomplete eps extraction are all possible to make the roles of eps in dewatering unpredictable and case dependent sheng et al 2010 even so the variation of eps reflects the network structure changes of sludge digestate to an extent liu et al 2010 found that the aggregation abilities of sludge samples decreased after the extraction of eps and the structure in terms of sludge compactness and the elasticity became stronger yuan et al 2014 these results suggest the potential to determine dewaterability from an overall and complete structural point of view chu and lee 2004 chu et al 2004 wu et al 2002 demonstrated the three dimensional porous structures in waste activated sludge flocs the fractal morphology method indexed by fractal dimension d f was utilized to analyze differences in sludge structure based on free settling image and light scattering analyses in conditioning process bushell et al 2002 positive correlations between d f and cst was identified during the conditioning process of activated sludge wang and dentel 2011 wang et al 2011 while during the anaerobic digestion process of sewage sludge jin et al 2004 found negative correlations between d f and cst besides the morphology network strength of sludge is also an important feature to characterize the sludge structure the total shearing energy input by the rheometer represents the plastic contribution of the floc network strength to detect the occurrence of optimum conditioning conditions yen et al 2002 örmeci and abu orf 2005 used the area under torque time rheogram to quantify energy dissipation within the sludge system and related to network strength örmeci 2007 wang and dentel 2011 identified positive correlations between cst and the peak height of the rheogram during sludge conditioning forster 2002 found that yield stress generally increased with dewaterability but no correlation was found by wang et al 2011 wang et al 2017 studied the acid conditioning of the activated sludge and found that cst correlated to limited viscosity positively in linear relationship based on the above discussions rheological measurement of the sludge is another potential method for characterizing the sludge network structure and understanding the mechanisms of dewaterability evolution during anaerobic digestion this study focuses on studying the mechanism of high solids sludge dewaterability evolution during anaerobic digestion with or without thermal hydrolysis from a novel view i e porous network structure two high solids anaerobic sequencing batch digesters of dewatered sludge with or without undergoing thermal hydrolysis pretreatment were operated for a full period of 30 days the network structure characteristics of sludge digestate including particle size surface area fractal dimension and structure strength were analyzed comprehensively the rheology of sludge a fundamental sludge characteristic was applied to present network strength for the determination of the energy required to break up the structure of a given volume of sludge in addition we evaluate the evolution of network strength as a tool to gain new insight to explain differences in the mechanisms of dewatering during anaerobic digestion with or without thermal hydrolysis pretreatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge samples dewatered sludge was collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in shanghai china the dewatered sludge without pretreatment was used as one sample and the dewatered sludge after thermally hydrolyzed pretreatment thp was used as another sample the procedure of thp includes two steps i put the dewatered sludge in an aluminum container for 30 min in a hyperbaric environment 160 c 0 55 mpa e100 senlang china ii then cooled to 25 c without gas discharge two anaerobic sequencing batch digesters r1 and r2 of mesophilic anaerobic digestion 35 c were operated for 30 days r1 was fed with unpretreated sludge and r2 was fed with thp pretreated sludge the seed sludge was cultured in advance in a semi continuous lab scale mesophilic anaerobic digester with dewatered sludge which was mixed with feed sludge in a proportion of 1 2 w w the properties of the mixed sludge in r1 and r2 are presented in table 1 the total solids ts and volatile solids to total solids vs ts contents were determined following the protocols provided in apha apha 2012 the sludge is about 50 volatile solids which is low compared to us and european sludges the ts of sludge in r1 and r2 were controlled to a similar level to avoid bias of the rheological properties of sludge digestate eshtiaghi et al 2013 2 2 analytical methods 2 2 1 chemical analyses prior to measuring soluble organic matter the sludge samples were centrifuged at 10 000 g at 4 c for 15 min and then the supernatant was passed through a 0 45 μm microfiber filter to harvest the filtrate volatile fatty acids vfas were measured on a gas chromatograph gc 2010 plus shimadzu japan equipped with a flame ionization detector fid and a capillary column rtx wax 0 25 mm 30 m total nitrogen tn was determined by a kjeldahl nitrogen analyzer k9860 hanon china total organic carbon toc was measured using a toc analyzer ssm 5000a toc l shimadzu japan 2 2 2 dewaterability measurement of high solids digestate although capillary suction time cst s has commonly been used for determining the dewaterability of activated sludge it is not applicable for high solids digestate with ts over 10 due to the excessively long suction time in this study the cst value for the thermally pretreated 160 c 30min sludge is 1924 s and the cst values for other samples are longer than 3000 s exceeding the detection limit of cst testing machine table s1 to determine the dewaterability of high solids sludge the centrifugation dewatering method was introduced li et al 2012 the ts of centrifugally dewatered cake ts d was measured as the index of dewaterability the higher the value of ts d the better the sludge dewaterability in each analysis about 100 mg digestate fig s1 was loaded onto a piece of membrane filter hold by a filter holder 25 mm swinnex millipore us and then centrifuged by a horizontal centrifuge tdl 5m xiangyi china the membrane filter made of nylon with pore sizes of 0 45 μm was chosen for achieving stable results fig s2 the centrifugal force was determined as 4000 g for good differences of different samples fig s2 the centrifugal duration was determined as 10 min which ensured the ts d remained stable fig s3 2 3 structure analyses 2 3 1 rheological characterization rheological behaviors were investigated using a stress controlled rotational rheometer kinexus lab malvern uk equipped with concentric cylinder geometries the detailed measurement procedure was the same as our former work zhang et al 2017 to ensure the repeatability and comparability of the results ratkovich et al 2013 the diameters of the cup and bob were 27 5 mm and 25 mm respectively creating a gap of 1 25 mm rough internal surfaces of the cup and the bob were selected to avoid wall slip the testing temperature was maintained at 15 c and controlled by a recirculating heat exchanger prior to each measurement the sludge sample was presheared at 1000 s 1 for 5 min and then allowed to rest for 5 min before conducting a shear stress sweep and a creep test and then rested for another 15 min before conducting an oscillatory shear test amplitude sweep oscillation tests were also introduced to measure the viscoelastic characteristics and determine the range of linear viscoelastic lve regime the test was conducted by an applied oscillatory strain at a set frequency of 1 hz with an amplitude sweeping over a range of 0 01 γ 100 zhang et al 2017 2 3 2 characterization of the porous network structure particle size distribution and fractal dimension were determined based on the light scattering method pabst and gregorova 2007 using a laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 3000 malvern uk according to rayleigh gans debye rgd approximation light intensity i wave vector q and fractal dimension d f satisfy eq 1 d f can be estimated from the slope of log i versus log q data by fitting a straight line through the section of the scattering plot in the fractal scattering regime 1 i q α q d f surface area s b was measured by nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm measurements at 77 k using a surface area and porosity instrument tristar ii 3020 micrometrics us before analyzing surface area of sludge the sludge sample was lyophilized and then stored at 20 c afterwards the samples were degassed at 105 c before measurement the surface area was calculated by the brunauer emmett teller bet model based on nitrogen pressure and adsorption volume pabst and gregorova 2007 3 results and discussions 3 1 performance of the batch digesters two high solids anaerobic sequencing batch digesters with raw dewatered sludge r1 and thermally hydrolyzed dewatered sludge r2 were operated under mesophilic conditions 35 c for 30 days until biogas emission had almost ceased the cumulative gas production was measured by wet type gas meter daily biogas yield was calculated by the difference value between two consecutive days fig 1 shows the daily biogas yield and cumulative biogas yield of the digesters over 30 days of anaerobic digestion the daily gas production of r2 was generally higher than that of r1 until the 21st day indicating that thp improved hydrolysis and further acetogenesis and methanogenesis xue et al 2015 han et al 2017 the daily gas production trend presents two peaks during the anaerobic digestion which are similar to the results of references zhang et al 2016 zhong et al 2011 the first peak shows the compositions which can be easily digested anaerobically increased after the biological treatment zhong et al 2011 because of thermal hydrolysis the first peak of r2 shows 2 days earlier than r1 before the second peak macromolecule component kept transforming into micromolecule component such as vfas the second peak shows the degradation of vfas from macromolecule component which can be observed from fig 2 in addition the cumulative biogas yield of r2 was 23 8 higher than that of r1 throughout the whole operational period fig 2 shows the variations of vfas toc and tn against digestion time soluble organic content which is mainly used by microbes for anaerobic digestion became almost stable after 9 days after thermal hydrolysis the concentrations of vfas toc and tn in r2 are much higher than those in r1 throughout the digestion process which are similar to the results of references chen et al 2018 han et al 2017 indicating that degradation of hydrolyzed organic matter by thermal treatment was incomplete 3 2 dewaterability fig 3 a presents the variations of digestate dewaterability during the anaerobic digestion of r1 and r2 the solid content of the centrifugally dewatered cake ts d representing the dewaterability of undigested sludge day 1 in the digesters are 27 0 for r1 unpretreated sludge mixed with seed sludge and 29 7 for r2 thp sludge mixed with seed sludge indicating that the thermal hydrolysis improved the desired sludge dewaterability in the pretreatment process moreover during anaerobic digestion the dewaterability of digestates was improved by the extension of digestion duration for both digesters which demonstrates that anaerobic digestion also enhanced sludge dewaterability xu et al 2009 compared to ts d on the first day the value of ts d over 30 days of digestion increased by 3 5 0 5 for digestate from r1 and 5 1 0 4 for digestate from r2 on the 30th day the dewaterability of digestate from r2 is 4 6 0 5 better than that from r1 as shown in fig 3 a the dewaterability in fig 3 b is normalized by the dewaterability of the first day ts d 0 in which the initial influence of thermal hydrolysis on undigested sludge is excluded the variation of normalized dewaterability against time represents the influence of anaerobic digestion on dewaterability and the different trends of r1 and r2 reflected that thermal hydrolysis affected anaerobic digestion reactions the normalized dewaterability of digestate sludge from r2 is higher than that from r1 throughout the whole process the increasing slope of digestate normalized dewaterability of the thp digester was steeper than that of digester with unpretreated sludge revealing that dewaterability of digestates during anaerobic digestion was further improved because of thermal hydrolysis pretreatment 3 3 rheological properties 3 3 1 sludge system the digestate sludge systems can be considered as a particle system due to the microbes and silica particles which are surrounded by slime and bound eps zhu et al 2009 figs 4 and 5 show the size distribution of sludge as a particle system where dx n is the particle size at the cumulative frequency of n as shown in fig 4 dx 10 dx 50 and dx 90 decreased during the operation of anaerobic digestion systems as microbes mainly use the organic matter in eps for anaerobic digestion reactions sheng et al 2010 the particle size decreased due to the degradation of macromolecular organic matter some part of the bound water was released as the eps structure split liu et al 2010 thus increased the dewaterability of digestate fig 5 shows the particle size distribution of the digestate from r1 and r2 on the first day the particle size of the two digestate samples show bimodal distribution indicating that the systems are heterogeneous because of the mixing of feed sludge and inoculum sludge at the first day at the end of the anaerobic digestion the r2 digestion system became homogeneous shown by one peak in fig 5 while the r1 system remained non homogeneous hence thermal hydrolysis pretreatment induces a more thorough degradation within 30 days than the digestate with unpretreated input sludge 3 3 2 equilibrium flow curve digestate samples taken throughout the 30 day digestion period all display qualitatively similar behavior in the equilibrium flow curve as illustrated in fig 6 all the tested digestate samples presented shear thinning behavior with yield stress an equilibrium flow curve can be modeled using a revised herschel bulkley model eq 2 zhang et al 2016 besides displaying initial yield stress τ y at low applied shear rate values the flow curves also exhibit a second critical shear stress τ c at an intermediate critical shear rate γ c reflecting the transition from a linear viscoelastic regime to a non linear viscoelastic regime 2 τ τ y k 1 γ n 1 γ γ c τ c k 2 γ n 2 γ γ c where k is the consistency index and n is the power law index a shear process may cause the disintegration of agglomerates and orientation of particles into a flow direction which shows as shear thinning flow behavior the effectivity of interactive forces between the particles then becomes more and more reduced which results in decreasing flow resistance mezger 2013 sludge has a yield point due to the intermolecular forces van der waals forces including dipole dipole interactions between particles and between particles and the surrounding dispersion agent based on physical chemical bonds secondary bonds mezger 2013 the apparent viscosity η τ γ of thp digestate samples in r2 fig 6 b were much lower than those in r1 fig 6 a which is approximately 20 of the apparent viscosity of unpretreated sludges at all shear rates in addition η and τ y decreased with digestion time in both digesters indicating that the interactions between the particles in the sludge systems became weaker the interactions may create a three dimensional physical network of forces and in the low deformation range this network occurs as a stable and solid like structure resulting in elastic behavior mezger 2013 hence to characterize the strength of the network structure it is necessary to characterize the elastic behavior of the sludge 3 3 3 viscoelastic phenomena amplitude sweep oscillation tests were conducted to investigate the evolution of viscoelastic sludge properties and structural strength as the anaerobic digestion process proceeded the elastic modulus g and viscous modulus g are plotted as functions of the applied strain γ in fig 7 g and g are nearly constant in the low strain regime showing linear viscoelastic lve behavior as γ 0 7 for unpretreated sludges and γ 0 5 for thp sludge this indicated that thermal hydrolysis shortened the range of the linear viscoelastic regime as the moduli g and g became strain dependent beyond the lve regime a decrease in g and a peak in g appeared as the strain increased thus demonstrating the payne effect the sudden decrease in g coincident with the maximum of g is indicative of a significant disruption to the internal structure of the sludge around this critical strain for sludge dispersion systems such a phenomenon could be explained by the breakdown of agglomerates or superstructures fixed in the network and flexible chains like polyacrylamide pam zhang et al 2017 the payne effect deceased as anaerobic digestion proceeded and the payne effect of thp sludges was weaker than that of unpretreated sludges the elastic modulus g in the lve regime reflecting structure strength is summarized in fig 8 the g values of thp sludges are tenfold lower than those of unpretreated sludges fig 8 a indicating that the thermal hydrolysis significantly weakened the structural strength of sludge in addition g in the lve regime of both thp and unpretreated sludges decreased with an increase of digestion time indicating that their structure was broken by anaerobic digestion fig 8 b shows the influence of anaerobic digestion in the two digesters on the normalized g g 0 where g 0 is related to the sludge on the first day the g g 0 values of thp sludges decreased faster than those of unpretreated sludges during the first 10 days and then slowed down and became lower than those of unpretreated sludge this indicates that the degradation of thp sludge was faster during the first 10 days afterwards the unpretreated sludge degraded faster which was consistent with daily biogas production fig 1 eps were found to occur as highly hydrated capsules surrounding the cell wall that are released as slime polymers into solution eps are of considerable importance in maintaining floc structure both by bridging through hydrophobic interactions and by producing a sludge entanglement network neyens and baeyens 2003 the consumption of eps during anaerobic digestion thus resulted in the deterioration of sludge structure strength 3 4 analysis of the porous network structure 3 4 1 surface area as well as for the 1st day and 30th day three more samples were analyzed to measure the surface area s b so as to profile the changes of sludge porous structure in fig 9 the s b values of sludge samples in r2 are much higher than those of r1 the increase of s b indicated that thermal hydrolysis pretreatment loosened the network structure of sludge digestate meanwhile the flocs degraded to smaller particles as demonstrated in fig 4 in addition the s b values increased with digestion time in both r1 and r2 which demonstrates that the structure of sludge became increasingly loose during anaerobic digestion furthermore in fig 9 b the surface area s b is normalized by the surface area of the first day s b 0 in which the initial influence of thermal hydrolysis on undigested sludge is excluded the increasing slope of r2 is higher than that of r1 which indicates that thermal hydrolysis pretreatment further loosened the sludge system during anaerobic digestion 3 4 2 fractal dimension fractal dimension d f which reflects the structural properties of an aggregate from geometry contains information about space filling ability surface roughness or ruggedness of the perimeter of the two dimensional particle outline projection or section and can vary from 1 a linear aggregate to 3 a compact or space filling form irregular particles with a rough surface or agglomerates can have fractal ranging from 2 to 3 wu et al 2002 the higher the fractal dimension the more compact the sludge system is hermawan et al 2004 fractal dimension is an average parameter that reflects the properties for all particles in the sludge wu et al 2002 in fig 10 the fractal dimensions of sludge samples in r2 are much lower than that of samples in r1 confirming the loosened network structure of digestate sludge by thermal hydrolysis pretreatment in addition d f values were found to decrease with increasing digestion time in both r1 and r2 which demonstrates that the sludge structure was loosened during anaerobic digestion the fitting slope of r2 is higher than that of r1 indicating that the degree of degradation by anaerobic digestion with thermal hydrolysis pretreatment was essentially improved in fig 10 b the fractal dimension d f is normalized by the fractal dimension of the first day d f 0 in which the initial influence of thermal hydrolysis on undigested sludge is excluded the variation of d f d f 0 against time represents the show similar trends between r1 and r2 3 5 relationship between sludge dewaterability and network structure fig 11 a shows the relationships among g in lve regime d f and ts d g and d f represent important features of porous sludge network structure during anaerobic digestion with and without the thermal hydrolysis pretreatment g d f and ts d all vary with digestion time reflecting the degree of degradation and pretreatment influence in fig 11 b the logarithmic of g increases with d f indicating that the higher the fractal dimension the stronger the elasticity of sludge this relationship quantitatively links the morphology and strength of sludge network structure during anaerobic digestion regardless of the pretreatment fig 11 c presents the relationship between porous network structure features and dewaterability during anaerobic digestion with and without undergoing thermal hydrolysis pretreatment for unpretreated and thp sludge both d f and g show linear relationships with ts d the weaker the structure strength is the better the sludge dewaters indicated by higher solid content of centrifugally dewatered cake the improvement of this dewaterability during anaerobic digestion can be observed by the weakening g and loosening d f of the sludge structure comparing the slopes in fig 11 c of unpretreated sludge in r1 0 57 for d f 0 063 for g and thp sludge in r2 0 74 for d f 0 084 for g the steeper slope of r2 is related to the physical parameters of both g and d f the above results demonstrate that thermal hydrolysis pretreatment improved dewaterability more significantly during anaerobic digestion as presented in fig 11 a c for the two anaerobic digestion processes with or without thermal hydrolysis the dewaterability of digestate shows negative relationship with particle size fractal dimensions and structure strength compared to the conditioning process örmeci 2007 wang and dentel 2011 the dewaterability showed positive relationship with structure strength average size and two dimensional fractal dimensions these different results can be explained by the different mechanisms between the conditioning process and anaerobic digestion in enhancing the sludge dewaterability in conditioning process the polymers build up floc structures to make the flocculation easier to separate from water in contrast the anaerobic digestion and thermal hydrolysis processes lead to the breakup of the network structure of sludge and release the bond water hold by the structure and the cells 4 conclusions in order to explain the mechanism of high solids sludge dewaterability evolution during anaerobic digestion with or without thermal hydrolysis the rheological characterization combined with the analysis of porous network structure compactness was applied in summary 1 with the extension of anaerobic digestion time the dewaterability increased with digestion time by power law relationship over one period operation the dewaterability of the sludge after digestion was improved by 3 5 0 5 for unpretreated sludge and 5 1 0 4 for the sludge pretreated by thermally hydrolysis compared to the sludge digestate without pretreatment thermal hydrolysis pretreatment finally resulted in an improvement of dewaterability by 4 6 0 5 2 dx 10 dx 50 and dx 90 decreased during anaerobic digestion the sludge systems were heterogeneous on the first day but the digestion with thermal hydrolysis pretreatment became homogeneous on the last day of a full period while unpretreated digestion remained non homogeneous throughout the whole period elastic modulus and fractal dimension decreased with increase of digestion time by power law relationship surface area increased with increase of digestion time with higher slope when thermal hydrolysis pretreatment applied 3 the elastic modulus increased logarithmically with fractal dimension regardless of the pretreatment both fractal dimension and elastic modulus showed linear relationship with dewaterability the structural strength of sludge was greatly weakened by thermal hydrolysis pretreatment and was further broken during anaerobic digestion which correspondingly explains relationships between the improved dewaterability of digestate and the loosening of the sludge

sludge a fundamental sludge characteristic was applied to present network strength for the determination of the energy required to break up the structure of a given volume of sludge in addition we evaluate the evolution of network strength as a tool to gain new insight to explain differences in the mechanisms of dewatering during anaerobic digestion with or without thermal hydrolysis pretreatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge samples dewatered sludge was collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in shanghai china the dewatered sludge without pretreatment was used as one sample and the dewatered sludge after thermally hydrolyzed pretreatment thp was used as another sample the procedure of thp includes two steps i put the dewatered sludge in an aluminum container for 30 min in a hyperbaric environment 160 c 0 55 mpa e100 senlang china ii then cooled to 25 c without gas discharge two anaerobic sequencing batch digesters r1 and r2 of mesophilic anaerobic digestion 35 c were operated for 30 days r1 was fed with unpretreated sludge and r2 was fed with thp pretreated sludge the seed sludge was cultured in advance in a semi continuous lab scale mesophilic anaerobic digester with dewatered sludge which was mixed with feed sludge in a proportion of 1 2 w w the properties of the mixed sludge in r1 and r2 are presented in table 1 the total solids ts and volatile solids to total solids vs ts contents were determined following the protocols provided in apha apha 2012 the sludge is about 50 volatile solids which is low compared to us and european sludges the ts of sludge in r1 and r2 were controlled to a similar level to avoid bias of the rheological properties of sludge digestate eshtiaghi et al 2013 2 2 analytical methods 2 2 1 chemical analyses prior to measuring soluble organic matter the sludge samples were centrifuged at 10 000 g at 4 c for 15 min and then the supernatant was passed through a 0 45 μm microfiber filter to harvest the filtrate volatile fatty acids vfas were measured on a gas chromatograph gc 2010 plus shimadzu japan equipped with a flame ionization detector fid and a capillary column rtx wax 0 25 mm 30 m total nitrogen tn was determined by a kjeldahl nitrogen analyzer k9860 hanon china total organic carbon toc was measured using a toc analyzer ssm 5000a toc l shimadzu japan 2 2 2 dewaterability measurement of high solids digestate although capillary suction time cst s has commonly been used for determining the dewaterability of activated sludge it is not applicable for high solids digestate with ts over 10 due to the excessively long suction time in this study the cst value for the thermally pretreated 160 c 30min sludge is 1924 s and the cst values for other samples are longer than 3000 s exceeding the detection limit of cst testing machine table s1 to determine the dewaterability of high solids sludge the centrifugation dewatering method was introduced li et al 2012 the ts of centrifugally dewatered cake ts d was measured as the index of dewaterability the higher the value of ts d the better the sludge dewaterability in each analysis about 100 mg digestate fig s1 was loaded onto a piece of membrane filter hold by a filter holder 25 mm swinnex millipore us and then centrifuged by a horizontal centrifuge tdl 5m xiangyi china the membrane filter made of nylon with pore sizes of 0 45 μm was chosen for achieving stable results fig s2 the centrifugal force was determined as 4000 g for good differences of different samples fig s2 the centrifugal duration was determined as 10 min which ensured the ts d remained stable fig s3 2 3 structure analyses 2 3 1 rheological characterization rheological behaviors were investigated using a stress controlled rotational rheometer kinexus lab malvern uk equipped with concentric cylinder geometries the detailed measurement procedure was the same as our former work zhang et al 2017 to ensure the repeatability and comparability of the results ratkovich et al 2013 the diameters of the cup and bob were 27 5 mm and 25 mm respectively creating a gap of 1 25 mm rough internal surfaces of the cup and the bob were selected to avoid wall slip the testing temperature was maintained at 15 c and controlled by a recirculating heat exchanger prior to each measurement the sludge sample was presheared at 1000 s 1 for 5 min and then allowed to rest for 5 min before conducting a shear stress sweep and a creep test and then rested for another 15 min before conducting an oscillatory shear test amplitude sweep oscillation tests were also introduced to measure the viscoelastic characteristics and determine the range of linear viscoelastic lve regime the test was conducted by an applied oscillatory strain at a set frequency of 1 hz with an amplitude sweeping over a range of 0 01 γ 100 zhang et al 2017 2 3 2 characterization of the porous network structure particle size distribution and fractal dimension were determined based on the light scattering method pabst and gregorova 2007 using a laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 3000 malvern uk according to rayleigh gans debye rgd approximation light intensity i wave vector q and fractal dimension d f satisfy eq 1 d f can be estimated from the slope of log i versus log q data by fitting a straight line through the section of the scattering plot in the fractal scattering regime 1 i q α q d f surface area s b was measured by nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherm measurements at 77 k using a surface area and porosity instrument tristar ii 3020 micrometrics us before analyzing surface area of sludge the sludge sample was lyophilized and then stored at 20 c afterwards the samples were degassed at 105 c before measurement the surface area was calculated by the brunauer emmett teller bet model based on nitrogen pressure and adsorption volume pabst and gregorova 2007 3 results and discussions 3 1 performance of the batch digesters two high solids anaerobic sequencing batch digesters with raw dewatered sludge r1 and thermally hydrolyzed dewatered sludge r2 were operated under mesophilic conditions 35 c for 30 days until biogas emission had almost ceased the cumulative gas production was measured by wet type gas meter daily biogas yield was calculated by the difference value between two consecutive days fig 1 shows the daily biogas yield and cumulative biogas yield of the digesters over 30 days of anaerobic digestion the daily gas production of r2 was generally higher than that of r1 until the 21st day indicating that thp improved hydrolysis and further acetogenesis and methanogenesis xue et al 2015 han et al 2017 the daily gas production trend presents two peaks during the anaerobic digestion which are similar to the results of references zhang et al 2016 zhong et al 2011 the first peak shows the compositions which can be easily digested anaerobically increased after the biological treatment zhong et al 2011 because of thermal hydrolysis the first peak of r2 shows 2 days earlier than r1 before the second peak macromolecule component kept transforming into micromolecule component such as vfas the second peak shows the degradation of vfas from macromolecule component which can be observed from fig 2 in addition the cumulative biogas yield of r2 was 23 8 higher than that of r1 throughout the whole operational period fig 2 shows the variations of vfas toc and tn against digestion time soluble organic content which is mainly used by microbes for anaerobic digestion became almost stable after 9 days after thermal hydrolysis the concentrations of vfas toc and tn in r2 are much higher than those in r1 throughout the digestion process which are similar to the results of references chen et al 2018 han et al 2017 indicating that degradation of hydrolyzed organic matter by thermal treatment was incomplete 3 2 dewaterability fig 3 a presents the variations of digestate dewaterability during the anaerobic digestion of r1 and r2 the solid content of the centrifugally dewatered cake ts d representing the dewaterability of undigested sludge day 1 in the digesters are 27 0 for r1 unpretreated sludge mixed with seed sludge and 29 7 for r2 thp sludge mixed with seed sludge indicating that the thermal hydrolysis improved the desired sludge dewaterability in the pretreatment process moreover during anaerobic digestion the dewaterability of digestates was improved by the extension of digestion duration for both digesters which demonstrates that anaerobic digestion also enhanced sludge dewaterability xu et al 2009 compared to ts d on the first day the value of ts d over 30 days of digestion increased by 3 5 0 5 for digestate from r1 and 5 1 0 4 for digestate from r2 on the 30th day the dewaterability of digestate from r2 is 4 6 0 5 better than that from r1 as shown in fig 3 a the dewaterability in fig 3 b is normalized by the dewaterability of the first day ts d 0 in which the initial influence of thermal hydrolysis on undigested sludge is excluded the variation of normalized dewaterability against time represents the influence of anaerobic digestion on dewaterability and the different trends of r1 and r2 reflected that thermal hydrolysis affected anaerobic digestion reactions the normalized dewaterability of digestate sludge from r2 is higher than that from r1 throughout the whole process the increasing slope of digestate normalized dewaterability of the thp digester was steeper than that of digester with unpretreated sludge revealing that dewaterability of digestates during anaerobic digestion was further improved because of thermal hydrolysis pretreatment 3 3 rheological properties 3 3 1 sludge system the digestate sludge systems can be considered as a particle system due to the microbes and silica particles which are surrounded by slime and bound eps zhu et al 2009 figs 4 and 5 show the size distribution of sludge as a particle system where dx n is the particle size at the cumulative frequency of n as shown in fig 4 dx 10 dx 50 and dx 90 decreased during the operation of anaerobic digestion systems as microbes mainly use the organic matter in eps for anaerobic digestion reactions sheng et al 2010 the particle size decreased due to the degradation of macromolecular organic matter some part of the bound water was released as the eps structure split liu et al 2010 thus increased the dewaterability of digestate fig 5 shows the particle size distribution of the digestate from r1 and r2 on the first day the particle size of the two digestate samples show bimodal distribution indicating that the systems are heterogeneous because of the mixing of feed sludge and inoculum sludge at the first day at the end of the anaerobic digestion the r2 digestion system became homogeneous shown by one peak in fig 5 while the r1 system remained non homogeneous hence thermal hydrolysis pretreatment induces a more thorough degradation within 30 days than the digestate with unpretreated input sludge 3 3 2 equilibrium flow curve digestate samples taken throughout the 30 day digestion period all display qualitatively similar behavior in the equilibrium flow curve as illustrated in fig 6 all the tested digestate samples presented shear thinning behavior with yield stress an equilibrium flow curve can be modeled using a revised herschel bulkley model eq 2 zhang et al 2016 besides displaying initial yield stress τ y at low applied shear rate values the flow curves also exhibit a second critical shear stress τ c at an intermediate critical shear rate γ c reflecting the transition from a linear viscoelastic regime to a non linear viscoelastic regime 2 τ τ y k 1 γ n 1 γ γ c τ c k 2 γ n 2 γ γ c where k is the consistency index and n is the power law index a shear process may cause the disintegration of agglomerates and orientation of particles into a flow direction which shows as shear thinning flow behavior the effectivity of interactive forces between the particles then becomes more and more reduced which results in decreasing flow resistance mezger 2013 sludge has a yield point due to the intermolecular forces van der waals forces including dipole dipole interactions between particles and between particles and the surrounding dispersion agent based on physical chemical bonds secondary bonds mezger 2013 the apparent viscosity η τ γ of thp digestate samples in r2 fig 6 b were much lower than those in r1 fig 6 a which is approximately 20 of the apparent viscosity of unpretreated sludges at all shear rates in addition η and τ y decreased with digestion time in both digesters indicating that the interactions between the particles in the sludge systems became weaker the interactions may create a three dimensional physical network of forces and in the low deformation range this network occurs as a stable and solid like structure resulting in elastic behavior mezger 2013 hence to characterize the strength of the network structure it is necessary to characterize the elastic behavior of the sludge 3 3 3 viscoelastic phenomena amplitude sweep oscillation tests were conducted to investigate the evolution of viscoelastic sludge properties and structural strength as the anaerobic digestion process proceeded the elastic modulus g and viscous modulus g are plotted as functions of the applied strain γ in fig 7 g and g are nearly constant in the low strain regime showing linear viscoelastic lve behavior as γ 0 7 for unpretreated sludges and γ 0 5 for thp sludge this indicated that thermal hydrolysis shortened the range of the linear viscoelastic regime as the moduli g and g became strain dependent beyond the lve regime a decrease in g and a peak in g appeared as the strain increased thus demonstrating the payne effect the sudden decrease in g coincident with the maximum of g is indicative of a significant disruption to the internal structure of the sludge around this critical strain for sludge dispersion systems such a phenomenon could be explained by the breakdown of agglomerates or superstructures fixed in the network and flexible chains like polyacrylamide pam zhang et al 2017 the payne effect deceased as anaerobic digestion proceeded and the payne effect of thp sludges was weaker than that of unpretreated sludges the elastic modulus g in the lve regime reflecting structure strength is summarized in fig 8 the g values of thp sludges are tenfold lower than those of unpretreated sludges fig 8 a indicating that the thermal hydrolysis significantly weakened the structural strength of sludge in addition g in the lve regime of both thp and unpretreated sludges decreased with an increase of digestion time indicating that their structure was broken by anaerobic digestion fig 8 b shows the influence of anaerobic digestion in the two digesters on the normalized g g 0 where g 0 is related to the sludge on the first day the g g 0 values of thp sludges decreased faster than those of unpretreated sludges during the first 10 days and then slowed down and became lower than those of unpretreated sludge this indicates that the degradation of thp sludge was faster during the first 10 days afterwards the unpretreated sludge degraded faster which was consistent with daily biogas production fig 1 eps were found to occur as highly hydrated capsules surrounding the cell wall that are released as slime polymers into solution eps are of considerable importance in maintaining floc structure both by bridging through hydrophobic interactions and by producing a sludge entanglement network neyens and baeyens 2003 the consumption of eps during anaerobic digestion thus resulted in the deterioration of sludge structure strength 3 4 analysis of the porous network structure 3 4 1 surface area as well as for the 1st day and 30th day three more samples were analyzed to measure the surface area s b so as to profile the changes of sludge porous structure in fig 9 the s b values of sludge samples in r2 are much higher than those of r1 the increase of s b indicated that thermal hydrolysis pretreatment loosened the network structure of sludge digestate meanwhile the flocs degraded to smaller particles as demonstrated in fig 4 in addition the s b values increased with digestion time in both r1 and r2 which demonstrates that the structure of sludge became increasingly loose during anaerobic digestion furthermore in fig 9 b the surface area s b is normalized by the surface area of the first day s b 0 in which the initial influence of thermal hydrolysis on undigested sludge is excluded the increasing slope of r2 is higher than that of r1 which indicates that thermal hydrolysis pretreatment further loosened the sludge system during anaerobic digestion 3 4 2 fractal dimension fractal dimension d f which reflects the structural properties of an aggregate from geometry contains information about space filling ability surface roughness or ruggedness of the perimeter of the two dimensional particle outline projection or section and can vary from 1 a linear aggregate to 3 a compact or space filling form irregular particles with a rough surface or agglomerates can have fractal ranging from 2 to 3 wu et al 2002 the higher the fractal dimension the more compact the sludge system is hermawan et al 2004 fractal dimension is an average parameter that reflects the properties for all particles in the sludge wu et al 2002 in fig 10 the fractal dimensions of sludge samples in r2 are much lower than that of samples in r1 confirming the loosened network structure of digestate sludge by thermal hydrolysis pretreatment in addition d f values were found to decrease with increasing digestion time in both r1 and r2 which demonstrates that the sludge structure was loosened during anaerobic digestion the fitting slope of r2 is higher than that of r1 indicating that the degree of degradation by anaerobic digestion with thermal hydrolysis pretreatment was essentially improved in fig 10 b the fractal dimension d f is normalized by the fractal dimension of the first day d f 0 in which the initial influence of thermal hydrolysis on undigested sludge is excluded the variation of d f d f 0 against time represents the show similar trends between r1 and r2 3 5 relationship between sludge dewaterability and network structure fig 11 a shows the relationships among g in lve regime d f and ts d g and d f represent important features of porous sludge network structure during anaerobic digestion with and without the thermal hydrolysis pretreatment g d f and ts d all vary with digestion time reflecting the degree of degradation and pretreatment influence in fig 11 b the logarithmic of g increases with d f indicating that the higher the fractal dimension the stronger the elasticity of sludge this relationship quantitatively links the morphology and strength of sludge network structure during anaerobic digestion regardless of the pretreatment fig 11 c presents the relationship between porous network structure features and dewaterability during anaerobic digestion with and without undergoing thermal hydrolysis pretreatment for unpretreated and thp sludge both d f and g show linear relationships with ts d the weaker the structure strength is the better the sludge dewaters indicated by higher solid content of centrifugally dewatered cake the improvement of this dewaterability during anaerobic digestion can be observed by the weakening g and loosening d f of the sludge structure comparing the slopes in fig 11 c of unpretreated sludge in r1 0 57 for d f 0 063 for g and thp sludge in r2 0 74 for d f 0 084 for g the steeper slope of r2 is related to the physical parameters of both g and d f the above results demonstrate that thermal hydrolysis pretreatment improved dewaterability more significantly during anaerobic digestion as presented in fig 11 a c for the two anaerobic digestion processes with or without thermal hydrolysis the dewaterability of digestate shows negative relationship with particle size fractal dimensions and structure strength compared to the conditioning process örmeci 2007 wang and dentel 2011 the dewaterability showed positive relationship with structure strength average size and two dimensional fractal dimensions these different results can be explained by the different mechanisms between the conditioning process and anaerobic digestion in enhancing the sludge dewaterability in conditioning process the polymers build up floc structures to make the flocculation easier to separate from water in contrast the anaerobic digestion and thermal hydrolysis processes lead to the breakup of the network structure of sludge and release the bond water hold by the structure and the cells 4 conclusions in order to explain the mechanism of high solids sludge dewaterability evolution during anaerobic digestion with or without thermal hydrolysis the rheological characterization combined with the analysis of porous network structure compactness was applied in summary 1 with the extension of anaerobic digestion time the dewaterability increased with digestion time by power law relationship over one period operation the dewaterability of the sludge after digestion was improved by 3 5 0 5 for unpretreated sludge and 5 1 0 4 for the sludge pretreated by thermally hydrolysis compared to the sludge digestate without pretreatment thermal hydrolysis pretreatment finally resulted in an improvement of dewaterability by 4 6 0 5 2 dx 10 dx 50 and dx 90 decreased during anaerobic digestion the sludge systems were heterogeneous on the first day but the digestion with thermal hydrolysis pretreatment became homogeneous on the last day of a full period while unpretreated digestion remained non homogeneous throughout the whole period elastic modulus and fractal dimension decreased with increase of digestion time by power law relationship surface area increased with increase of digestion time with higher slope when thermal hydrolysis pretreatment applied 3 the elastic modulus increased logarithmically with fractal dimension regardless of the pretreatment both fractal dimension and elastic modulus showed linear relationship with dewaterability the structural strength of sludge was greatly weakened by thermal hydrolysis pretreatment and was further broken during anaerobic digestion which correspondingly explains relationships between the improved dewaterability of digestate and the loosening of the sludge

19781,human fecal contamination of water is a public health risk however inadequate testing solutions frustrate timely actionable monitoring bacterial culture based methods are simple but typically cannot distinguish fecal host source pcr assays can identify host sources but require expertise and infrastructure to bridge this gap we have developed a field ready nucleic acid diagnostic platform and rapid sample preparation methods that enable on site identification of human fecal contamination within 80 min of sampling our platform relies on loop mediated isothermal amplification lamp of human associated bacteroides hf183 genetic markers from crude samples oligonucleotide strand exchange osd probes reduce false positives by sequence specifically transducing lamp amplicons into visible fluorescence that can be photographed by unmodified smartphones our assay can detect as few as 17 copies ml of human associated hf183 targets in sewage contaminated water without cross reaction with canine or feline feces it performs robustly with a variety of environmental water sources and with raw sewage we have also developed lyophilized assays and inexpensive 3d printed devices to minimize cost and facilitate field application graphical abstract image 1 keywords fecal indicator bacteria fecal source identification isothermal nucleic acid amplification portable molecular diagnostics dna strand displacement probes 1 introduction since human fecal contamination is a major health and environmental threat gasalla and gandini 2016 given et al 2006 wear and thurber 2015 vigilant monitoring of water quality is increasingly required culture based methods are available for determining the quantity of fecal indicating bacteria fib harwood et al 2014 but these methods are slow and often lack the diagnostic information necessary to identify the source faster methods relying on immunomagnetic fib separation followed by adenosine triphosphate quantitation have been explored zimmer faust et al 2014 however distinguishing the original source of fecal pollution is crucial in devising appropriate control prevention and risk management practices to address this need a number of molecular diagnostic technologies have been developed that allow for host identification ahmed et al 2007 bernhard and field 2000 chase et al 2012 gourmelon et al 2007 graves et al 2007 kildare et al 2007 martellini et al 2005 newton et al 2011 2013 peed et al 2011 reischer et al 2007 shanks et al 2006 viau and boehm 2011 these methods are useful due to their high levels of precision specificity and sensitivity for instance the hf183 bfdrev and humm2 quantitative pcr qpcr methods perform well for tracking human sourced fecal pollution haugland et al 2010 layton et al 2013 shanks et al 2010 molecular diagnostic techniques have been helpful in determining best management practices in complicated watersheds for examples see references riedel et al 2015 and ervin et al 2014 however successfully implementing pcr qpcr requires expensive equipment and expertise typically only available in centralized testing facilities necessitating sample shipment and associated lengthy turnaround time and high cost per test per sample isothermal nucleic acid amplification methods such as loop mediated isothermal amplification lamp can potentially rival pcr for sensitivity but in a simplified format since they do not require thermocycling boyle et al 2013 de paz et al 2014 rohrman and richards kortum 2012 however field use has often been limited by the propensity of isothermal methods like lamp to be overrun by non specific amplicons leading to false positive results abbasi et al 2016 kuboki et al 2003 tomita et al 2008 in our previous work we overcame spurious lamp signals by applying principles of nucleic acid strand exchange circuitry chakraborty et al 2016 seelig et al 2006 yin et al 2008 zhang et al 2007 to develop oligonucleotide strand displacement osd probes that like taqman probes in pcr sequence specifically transduce lamp amplicons into a readable signal jiang et al 2015 osd probes are short hemiduplex dnas in which the short single stranded region in the longer strand acts as a toehold that hybridizes to complementary sequences in lamp amplicon loops and initiates strand exchange zhang and seelig 2011 ultimately resulting in hybridization of the longer fluorophore labeled strand to the lamp loop and concomitant displacement of the quencher labeled strand the ensuing real time fluorescence accumulation allows osds to sequence specifically report single or multiplex accumulation of lamp amplicons from tens to a few hundred nucleic acid molecules with minimal interference from non specific amplicons or inhibitors bhadra et al 2015 this innovation significantly enhanced the diagnostic applicability of lamp by allowing it to match not only the sensitivity but also the specificity of real time pcr the epa approved hf183 taqman qpcr assay is one of the best performing methods designed to distinguish human fecal contamination in environmental water by identifying genetic signatures from human specific bacterial clusters belonging to the genus bacteroides boehm et al 2013 nshimyimana et al 2014 riedel et al 2014 these bacteria are ideal genetic identifiers of fecal source because they are restricted to warm blooded animals and are present in significant numbers in feces hayashi et al 2002 moreover they have a limited potential to re grow in the environment due to their anaerobic lifestyle balleste and blanch 2010 although the hf183 qpcr provides discriminating information its widespread use in water quality monitoring is difficult due to the technical expertise and expensive instruments required for execution we surmised that we could leverage the excellent human fecal specificity demonstrated by the hf183 signature sequence and create a portable inexpensive molecular assay for in field use to aid and expand water quality monitoring in the present work we demonstrate a field ready human fecal diagnostic based on a lamp osd assay intentionally designed to target the same human specific bacteroides sequence cluster also targeted by the hf183 taqman qpcr green et al 2014 to enhance portability and minimize cost we have reduced equipment needs by eliminating reagent cold chain utilizing simple and rapid sample preparation methods with syringe filters reaction warming with commercially available hand warmers and reading the output using unmodified smartphones we test the detection limit and off target reactivity of this hf183 lamp osd system and demonstrate its robust performance with a variety of environmental water sources including artificial seawater and water contaminated with humic acids 2

al 2007 shibata et al 2010 for instance primer explorer v5 was constrained to use the hf183 qpcr forward primer hf183f as the inner primer f2 region when designing lamp primer sets for human associated hf183 sequences six primer sets generated by primer explorer four sets targeting the human specific hf183 sequences and two sets targeting dog fecal bacteroides were selected for functional testing by real time lamp measured using evagreen intercalation one primer set each supplementary table t1 that amplified the fewest template copies with minimal non specific amplification was selected for assay development in the hf183primer set the b2 region of bip was complementary to sequences that partially overlap hf183 qpcr reverse primer bfdrev and taqman probe bfdfam binding sites the f1 region of fip and b1 region of bip bound to target sequences intervening the hf183f and bfdrev qpcr primer binding sites the hf183 lamp assay was subsequently appended with a fifth loop primer designed to bind to the loop sequence between the f2 and f1c regions of the amplicon an osd probe was designed to also recognize the same target region as the bacr287 hf183 qpcr primer a reverse primer demonstrated to improve the performance of hf183 qpcr and the bfdfam bthetp1 hf183 qpcr taqman probe green et al 2014 the osd probe specifically undergoes toehold mediated strand exchange with the hf183 lamp loop sequence intervening the b1 and b2c regions and was designed using our previously published design rules and the nupack software suite jiang et al 2015 zadeh et al 2011 briefly a 33 nucleotide long osd strand reporter f and its complementary 22 nucleotide long osd strand reporter q were designed to form a hemiduplex dna that displayed a single stranded toehold of 11 bp at the 5 end of reporter f the 3 end of reporter f was labeled with fluorescein while the 5 end of reporter q displayed an iowa black fq quencher moiety the 3 end of the reporter q strand was blocked against polymerase mediated extension by incorporation of an inverted dt modification lamp osd assay for the e coli uspb gene supplementary table t1 was designed de novo using the same web based tools for

osd reporter 100 nm reporter f annealed with 120 nm reporter q and 16 units of bst 2 0 dna polymerase in 1 isothermal buffer containing an additional 2 mm mgso4 the primer annealing step was omitted and the reactions tubes were directly incubated for 1 h in a thermal cycler held at 60 c at the end of the incubation period osd fluorescence was imaged using an unmodified iphone 6 and an ultraslim led transilluminator syngene frederick md usa in some experiments fluorescence visualization and smartphone imaging were achieved with the aid of an imaging device 2 5 4 2 5 cm designed and 3d printed in house the imaging device was designed with a completely removable lid that also served as the rack for holding lamp osd reaction tubes for imaging one super bright blue 5 mm light emitting diode led adafruit new york ny usa per assay tube slot was placed at the bottom of the imaging box such that its blue light would hit the assay tube in the slot from the bottom an observation and imaging window was designed on one of the four faces of the cuboid device such that fluorescence emission could be captured at a 90 angle to the incident excitation source two cut to fit layers of inexpensive 500 nm bandpass orange lighting gel sheets lee filters burbank ca usa were attached to the observation window in order to filter the osd fluorescence for observation in some experiments the hf183 lamp osd reaction tubes were incubated in a chemical incubation chamber created by placing two aerated hand warmer pouches hot hands dalton ga usa inside a small 6 6 2 5 cm cardboard box lined with 6 mm thick layer of cork once the inside chamber temperature reached 60 c the lamp osd reaction tubes were sandwiched in between the two hand warmer pouches a small temperature probe was also inserted in the chamber prior to closing the lid in order to monitor the temperature which steadily remained between 60 c and 63 c in replicate experiments after 1 h of incubation osd fluorescence was imaged using an iphone and an ultraslim led transilluminator or the 3d printed imaging device 2 6 hf183 taqman qpcr a previously published taqman qpcr assay was used for hf183 quantitation green et al 2014 briefly 0 093 μm bfdfam taqman probe 1 2 μm bfdrev reverse primer and 1 2 μm hf183f forward primer were mixed with 1 faststart essential dna probes master roche and seeded with 6 μl water containing zero to several copies of purified synthetic templates or with 6 μl concentrated environmental sample following two pre heating steps 2 min at 50 c and 10 min at 95 c 50 cycles of two step pcr amplification 15 s at 95 c followed by 1 min at 60 c and fluorescence measurement were performed using the lightcycler 96 real time pcr machine 2 7 water sample processing water samples used for testing included i artificial creek water acw 1 3 mm k2hpo4 1 7 mm kh2po4 7 9 mm nacl ii environmental water samples collected from a local creek waller creek austin tx usa a pond with resident fish

municipal tap water containing 20 w v or 2 w v humic acid sigma 50 ml water samples were either processed directly after collection or were spiked with different amounts of lab grown recombinant e coli phf183 bacterial colony counts were measured by plating a series of 10 fold dilutions on luria bertani agar plates containing 100 μg ml ampicillin in some experiments acw samples were spiked with primary filtered raw sewage walnut creek wastewater treatment plant austin tx usa freshly collected sewage was stored at 4 c and used within 6 h of collection in off target reactivity experiments acw was spiked with fresh feline or canine feces prior to processing for assays feces 0 464 g from a single cat were dissolved in 50 ml acw cf0 200 μl 20 μl and 2 μl of the cf0 sample were added into 50 ml acw and tested by culturing on mtec and mei plates see below and by hf183 lamp osd assays fresh sample 1 09 g from either an individual dog feces 1 dog or a mixture of nine dog feces 9 dogs were mixed in 50 ml acw df0 500 μl 200 μl or 20 μl of the df0 sample were spiked into 50 ml acw and tested by culturing on mtec and mei plates see below and by human and dog feces distinguishing lamp assays nucleic acid amplification assays water samples were placed in 60 cc syringes becton dickinson franklin lakes nj usa and manually filtered through a 0 45 μm pore size cellulose acetate syringe filter filters bearing the retentates including microbial contaminants were subsequently transferred to 1 cc syringes that were used to recover the retentate by back flushing the filters with 200 μl sterile water for some water samples such as seawater and water contaminated with humic acids the retentate bearing filters were washed by flushing through 10 ml sterile water prior to retentate recovery via back flushing with 200 μl sterile water some 5 6 μl aliquots of these 200 μl recovered retentates were directly added to lamp osd or taqman qpcr assays for assessing the presence or absence of fecal signature sequences bacterial culture based assays e coli and enterococci in water samples contaminated with primary raw sewage were enumerated by culturing on modified mtec membrane thermotolerant escherichia coli and mei membrane enterococcus indoxyl β d glucoside agar plates respectively using published epa protocols epa 2006 2009 briefly 50 ml water samples were filtered through sterile 0 45 μm pore size 47 mm diameter grid marked membrane filters using a vacuum filtration manifold filters were then removed from the filter housing and gently placed on mtec or mei plates and incubated according to their respective protocols 2 8 hf183 lamp osd lyophilization lyophilized hf183 lamp osd assays were prepared by mixing 0 25 μl of glycerol free bst 2 0 120 units μl 2 5 μl of annealed osd reporter 1 1 2 μm reporter f reporter q strands 2 μl of lamp primer mix 5 μm each of f3 and b3 20 μm each of fip and bip 10 μm of loop primer 5 μl of 4 mm dntp mix and 1 25 μl of 1 m trehalose the mixture was frozen for 15 min at 80 c and then lyophilized for 3 h using the virtis benchtop pro lyophilizer sp scientific warminster pa usa for determining storage stability replicate lyophilized assays were stored at 20 c 25 c and 42 c lyophilized lamp osd assays were functionally tested at various intervals by rehydrating with 25 μl solution containing different amounts of template 1 isothermal buffer 1 m betaine and 2 mm additional mgso4 2 9 statistical analysis real time qpcr data was analyzed using the lightcycler 96 software cq values for real time lamp osd assays were also determined using the lightcycler 96 software for lamp assays read at endpoint using a smartphone samples were scored as detected when osd fluorescence was visible after 60 min of amplification for estimating the fewest template copies that can be detected using hf183 lamp osd assays seven replicate reactions at each template amount were analyzed in real time assays while six replicates were imaged at endpoint using smartphones 3 results 3 1 hf183 lamp osd assay design a unique set of five lamp primers f3 b3 fip bip and lp and an osd probe were designed to recognize eight different target sites within a 210 bp human fecal associated sequence that encompasses the 167 bp stretch detected by the hf183f bfdrev taqman qpcr assay supplementary fig s1 since the lamp osd and taqman qpcr assays use different primers they could potentially target different populations of bacteroides to test this we subjected the 210 bp target region to basic local alignment search tool blast analysis against bacteroidales sequence database altschul et al 1990 the outer initiation primers f3 and b3 produce a 210 bp product after the initiation step the fip and bip primers exponentially amplify a 153 bp sub section of the target this 153 bp region is completely encompassed by the taqman qpcr 167 bp amplicon supplementary fig s1 jiang et al 2015 some 67 of the first 1000 blast hits demonstrated 99 100 sequence similarity and would be detectable by both hf183 lamp osd and by taqman qpcr supplementary fig s1 1 of the first 1000 hits were 97 98 similar and hence should also be detectable by both assays the remaining 32 of the top 1000 hits contained 4 6 sequence variation which would likely eliminate reactivity with both hf183 taqman qpcr and lamp osd assays these results suggest that the hf183 lamp osd assay will have a similar range of detection targets as the hf183 bfdrev taqman qpcr assay we functionally assessed this lamp osd assay by challenging it with different copies of synthetic plasmids bearing the hf183 target sequence and measuring ensuing fluorescence in real time using a pcr machine or at endpoint using a smartphone our results demonstrate that lamp osd could always detect 10 to 20 copies of hf183 fig 1 b and d which is comparable to many hf183 taqman qpcr assays green et al 2014 amplifiable plasmid copy numbers were verified by parallel examination with qpcr using hf183f and bfdrev primers along with the bfdfam taqman probe supplementary fig s2 comparison of the real time amplification kinetics of lamp osd and taqman qpcr showed that on average the hf183 lamp osd assay had a 35 min faster time to result compared to qpcr table 1 3 2 instrument free hf183 lamp osd assay for in field use in order to parse osd fluorescence with minimal hardware we built a small 2 5 4 2 5 cm 3d printed imaging device containing 470 nm light emitting diodes leds one per assay tube for fluorescence excitation and a window covered with two layers of inexpensive 500 nm band pass orange gel filter for viewing and imaging fluorescence supplementary fig s3 to maximize visual distinction of signal from background we optimized lamp osd composition by increasing the amount of deoxyribonucleotides primers enzymes and osd reporters the resulting endpoint target stimulated osd fluorescence excited by a single led in our imaging device is visible to human eyes and appears bright in smartphone camera images meanwhile background signal in the absence of target amplicons remains below the detection limit of human eyes and smartphone cmos cameras to ensure that the simplification of assay readout does not compromise detection limit we assessed the limit of detection of the smartphone imaged hf183 lamp osd assay by amplifying different copies of hf183 target dna our data fig 1c indicate that as few as 10 copies of target dna could be detected using smartphone imaging of optimized hf183 lamp osd assays assay results were independent of variations in smartphone hardware and operating system supplementary fig s3d to complement this simplification of assay readout using smartphones we tested the usability of chemical heat for maintaining temperatures suitable for isothermal amplification sandwiching the tubes between the two hand warmers produced uniform heating and also minimized the loss of volume due to evaporation and misplaced condensation supplementary fig s3a following 60 min of incubation in this chemical heat chamber the tubes were transferred to our fluorescence imaging device supplementary fig s3b and photographed using a smartphone in the presence of hf183 targets all assays produced bright fluorescence assays lacking specific templates remained dark supplementary fig s3c 3 3 rapid environmental water sample processing for direct hf183 lamp osd analysis a filtration based sample preparation method see section 2 7 was developed for in field use fig 2 a to validate this two step filter back flush sampling methodology we prepared artificial creek water samples contaminated with known amounts of laboratory grown recombinant e coli harboring the hf183 target sequence subsequently these water samples were processed using the filter back flush methodology and 6 μl aliquots from the 200 μl of processed samples were assessed directly using hf183 lamp osd assays the high temperature required for lamp is known to cause significant damage to bacterial structure mackey et al 1991 thus enabling access to and amplification of the resident nucleic acid targets smartphone images revealed that 50 ml water samples contaminated with as few as 3 6 cfu ml of recombinant e coli phf183 could be readily identified as contaminated supplementary fig s4 these results indicate that the filter back flush methodology is suitable for rapid processing of water samples for downstream lamp osd analysis similar filtration approaches have been previously used successfully to rapidly purify bacteria such as chlamydia trachomatis from infected cellular homogenates campbell et al 1991 we next sought to verify the universal applicability of our filter back flush sampling methodology for processing recreational and environmental water samples of different origins and compositions to that end we collected several samples from a local creek a pond a fountain a chlorinated swimming pool and municipal drinking water a portion of these samples was subjected directly to filtration and back flushing followed by hf183 lamp osd analysis one creek water sample was positive for hf183 by both lamp osd and by pcr suggesting the presence of human fecal contamination supplementary fig s5 none of the remaining untampered water samples generated a positive hf183 lamp osd signal a second sample set of these environmental and drinking water sources that did not suffer natural human fecal contamination was analyzed following introduction of known numbers of laboratory grown recombinant e coli harboring hf183 target dna fig 2b when the water samples were spiked with as few as 19 colony forming units ml of e coli phf183 we were able to clearly identify the contamination using our two step filter back flush sample preparation protocol followed immediately by lamp osd analysis fig 2b these results are suggestive of the suitability of our rapid sampling and isothermal diagnostic platform for analysis of many different environmental water samples to verify analytical compatibility with water laden with potential inhibitors we challenged our filter back flush sample processing method with artificial seawater containing a high concentration of monovalent salts known to inhibit bst dna polymerase ong et al 2015 seawater contaminated with recombinant e coli phf183 failed to produce a positive lamp osd signal fig 2c we surmised that the lamp osd assay might have been inhibited by excess salt introduced in the analyte upon back flushing the sample filter containing residual seawater therefore we modified the protocol by washing the filter once with 10 ml of deionized water prior to back flushing the filter to collect the bacterial retentate for hf183 lamp osd analysis e coli phf183 contaminated artificial seawater samples subjected to this three step sample processing comprising filtration and washing followed by retentate back flushing produced a clear positive signal upon hf183 lamp osd analysis fig 2c three step filter wash back flush sample processing is also efficient at reducing organic contaminants and allowing direct hf183 lamp osd analysis of humic acid containing water samples fig 2c these results demonstrate that our simple and robust three step filtration based sample processing approach integrated with the smartphone read instrument free one pot hf183 lamp osd assay fig 2a is well suited for rapid inspection of a diversity of commonly encountered water samples without requiring complex and laborious nucleic acid purification steps however one caveat in these results is the use of phf183 plasmid bearing bacteria chromosomal targets might not be as readily accessible for amplification as plasmids without nucleic acid purification since hf183 bacteroides cannot be easily cultured bae and wuertz 2009 we engineered a new lamp osd assay designed to amplify and detect a single copy e coli chromosomal gene called uspb that encodes the universal stress protein b farewell et al 1998 the uspb assay could readily detect the uspb marker in 6 cfu reaction of e coli fig 3 thermal lysis of e coli prior to assay reduced the time to detection these observations suggest that hf183 chromosomal sequences in bacteroides a gram negative bacterium like e coli should also be accessible for direct lamp osd amplification and detection 3 4 hf183 lamp osd analysis of sewage contaminated water in order to assess the robustness of our sample processing and lamp osd methodology in detecting actual human fecal contamination instead of laboratory cultured hf183 e coli we spiked 50 ml of sterile artificial creek water with different amounts of sewage primary raw sewage was collected on two separate occasions from the walnut creek wastewater treatment plant one of two major plants in austin texas with a total permitted capacity of 150 million gallons per day sewage contaminated water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm pore size syringe filters followed by back flushing of the retentate in 200 μl of sterile water of which 6 μl were directly analyzed by hf183 lamp osd assay followed by endpoint imaging with a smartphone our results demonstrate that the hf183 lamp osd assay could reliably detect the presence of as little as 1 μl and 5 μl of fresh primary sewage samples 1 and 2 respectively in 50 ml of water samples fig 4 taqman qpcr analysis of the two sewage samples determined that sewage sample 1 contained 8 7 105 copies ml of hf183 analytes while sewage 2 had 2 6 105 hf183 copies ml fig 4 and supplementary fig s6 these amounts correlate well with reported estimates of 2 105 to 8 105 hf183 copies ml of sewage sampled from many different geographic areas ahmed et al 2016 boehm et al 2015 this implies that our hf183 lamp osd assay can easily detect as few as 17 to 26 hf183 copies ml in sewage contaminated water these data suggest that our rapid sample processing methodology is efficient and the hf183 lamp osd assay can robustly operate using crude samples without significant loss in detection limit 3 5 off target activity of hf183 lamp osd assay since we engineered our hf183 lamp osd assay to utilize many of the same priming and probing sequences responsible for the fecal source specificity of the hf183 taqman qpcr we expect our hf183 lamp osd assay to demonstrate similar stringency for distinguishing human fecal contamination to verify this we challenged the hf183 lamp osd assay with different amounts of fresh feces collected from 10 canine and 1 feline pets in this proof of concept study we chose to test cross reactivity with these two fecal sources because studies report dogs and cats to be among the primary sources of fecal contamination in urban watersheds schueler 1999 these artificially contaminated water samples contained viable fecal bacteria as illustrated by enumeration of fecal indicator e coli and enterococci in duplicate water samples cultured on mtec and mei bacteriological media none of the hf183 lamp osd assays seeded with canine or feline feces accumulated osd fluorescence signal and hence remained as dark as the negative controls fig 5 a and c in contrast positive control assays seeded with hf183 templates generated bright fluorescence as a control to demonstrate the absence of inhibitors and the presence of amplifiable nucleic acids in these animal fecal samples we designed a lamp assay to amplify bacteroides molecular signatures previously used to design dog feces specific qpcr assays boehm et al 2013 dick et al 2005 kildare et al 2007 shibata et al 2010 stewart et al 2013 as seen in fig 5b water samples contaminated with canine feces elicited a clear positive signal when tested with the dog associated bacteroides lamp assay 3 6 lamp osd master mix lyophilization for storage without cold chain ready to use hf183 lamp osd master mixes replete with enzymes primers and osd probes were stored at 20 c for 60 days there was no significant loss in amplification efficiency as evident from cq values comparable to those obtained with freshly prepared assays supplementary fig s7 these master mixes will greatly simplify rapid assessment of water samples however ready to use assays that can be stably stored and shipped without cold storage are highly desirable for reducing operating costs and facilitating in field use therefore we lyophilized hf183 lamp osd master mixes containing primers osd probes deoxyribonucleotides bst 2 0 dna polymerase and the stabilizer trehalose several sets of lyophilized assays stored at 20 c 25 c or 42 c were periodically tested for function by rehydration with 1 isothermal buffer containing magnesium and betaine even after 100 days of storage at temperatures as high as 42 c the lyophilized hf183 lamp osd assays efficiently amplified hf183 dna targets resulting in accumulation of bright osd fluorescence fig 6 no signal was obtained in the absence of specific targets it should be noted that betaine and isothermal buffer are independently stable for long durations when stored without cold chain supplementary fig s8 these results further bolster the point of need applicability of our hf183 lamp osd assay system 4 discussion human fecal contamination in environmental waters is problematic due to the associated risk of disseminating hazardous pathogens and antibiotic resistance the problem is further exacerbated by climate changes natural and man made disasters zolnikov 2013 and failing infrastructures the need to invest in innovative diagnostic technologies for resource recovery and for monitoring pollution sources is well recognized young et al 2015 high quality informative and actionable data is not only important for supporting the health of a water body but is key for guiding policy and investment towards best management practices development of new diagnostic approaches education of the next generation of water professionals and facilitation of data collection are the keys to achieving global improvement in water quality young et al 2015 advanced qpcr based molecular diagnostic methods to pinpoint sources of fecal contamination have been developed with the hope of achieving these goals however these methods need complicated instruments and highly trained operators unfortunately infrastructure is expensive and there exists a severe gap in the technically trained human resource crocker et al 2016 iwa 2014 these limitations have prevented widespread adoption of qpcr methods into water monitoring regimens we have developed a low cost rapid easy to use platform technology for in field detection of human fecal nucleic acid signatures in environmental and drinking water our technology effectively integrates the amplification power of lamp and the sequence specificity of dna computational osd probes to identify as few as 17 to 26 copies of bacteroides hf183 sequences ml indicative of human feces in minimally processed sewage contaminated water samples with no cross reactivity to dog or feline feces ancillary design details have been tailored to facilitate robustness portability and widespread in field use by reducing the need for expensive instruments technical education and laborious user required processes these design details include i minimization of procedural complexity one pot visually readable assays directly analyze crudely concentrated samples without requiring nucleic acid purification ii elimination of complex instruments or data analytics visual yes no assay readout allows easy assessment of the presence or absence of contamination without iii data accessibility ability to capture lamp osd signal with unmodified smartphones allows rapid data sharing through networks and iv infrastructure cost reduction lyophilized master mixes storable without cold chain reduce operation and distribution cost these design innovations have also allowed us to achieve reliable sample to answer testing results within only 80 min of sampling not only is this a sizeable acceleration over current qpcr or culture based tests that require several hours to days to produce results but due to the on site applicability our test also dismantles the time and monetary cost of sample storage and shipment one criticism that might be raised is the inability of hf183 lamp osd to provide a quantitative determination of the level of contamination to address this concern we have recently developed a robust field usable technology for semi quantitative lamp that enables reliable measurement of initial target copies on an order of magnitude scale via a simple one time determination of the presence or absence of visible osd fluorescence at reaction endpoint jiang et al 2017 osd fluorescence amplitude is rendered a function of initial target copies by diverting replicative resources from these true targets to defined numbers of competing false targets that display the same primer binding sites and amplification kinetics but lack osd complementarity we have successfully used these one pot semi quantitative lamp osd reactions to directly and quantitatively estimate the numbers of hf183 nucleic acids in sewage with the values obtained closely correlating with hf183 taqman qpcr quantitation jiang et al 2017 importantly semi quantitative hf183 lamp osd reactions are amenable to endpoint readout via smartphone unlike other methods such as qpcr that require continuous monitoring and should therefore remain extremely useful for in field water quality monitoring without any sophisticated instrumentation or informatics in ongoing efforts we are expanding the test suite of the lamp osd platform to allow more comprehensive fecal pollution tracking of non human sources as well as direct detection of water borne pathogens ultimately the utility of the lamp osd platform technology goes beyond water quality testing the modular nature of the robust platform should allow rapid prototyping of sample processing methods and assays to detect almost any nucleic acid sequence signature in desired specimens 5 conclusions we have developed a low cost easy to use molecular test to rapidly identify human fecal contamination in water by detecting as few as 17 copies ml of human associated bacteroides hf183 sequence with no off target signal from dog or cat feces this platform technology has low power requirements and is engineered for on site sample to answer testing of minimally processed water samples without needing nucleic acid purification as a result our technology can bridge the gap in technically trained human resource by i allowing citizen scientists with minimal expertise to actionably monitor water quality and ii serving as a low cost easy to use teaching tool for educating the next generation of experts we anticipate that these features would enhance adoption in routine monitoring and would be invaluable during emergencies presented by infrastructure failure and disruption unlike current bacteriological and molecular methods that require several hours to days to produce results rapid in field generation of information would expedite action and allow individuals to lobby for improved water quality and affect water quality change in their communities acknowledgments funding this work

19781,human fecal contamination of water is a public health risk however inadequate testing solutions frustrate timely actionable monitoring bacterial culture based methods are simple but typically cannot distinguish fecal host source pcr assays can identify host sources but require expertise and infrastructure to bridge this gap we have developed a field ready nucleic acid diagnostic platform and rapid sample preparation methods that enable on site identification of human fecal contamination within 80 min of sampling our platform relies on loop mediated isothermal amplification lamp of human associated bacteroides hf183 genetic markers from crude samples oligonucleotide strand exchange osd probes reduce false positives by sequence specifically transducing lamp amplicons into visible fluorescence that can be photographed by unmodified smartphones our assay can detect as few as 17 copies ml of human associated hf183 targets in sewage contaminated water without cross reaction with canine or feline feces it performs robustly with a variety of environmental water sources and with raw sewage we have also developed lyophilized assays and inexpensive 3d printed devices to minimize cost and facilitate field application graphical abstract image 1 keywords fecal indicator bacteria fecal source identification isothermal nucleic acid amplification portable molecular diagnostics dna strand displacement probes 1 introduction since human fecal contamination is a major health and environmental threat gasalla and gandini 2016 given et al 2006 wear and thurber 2015 vigilant monitoring of water quality is increasingly required culture based methods are available for determining the quantity of fecal indicating bacteria fib harwood et al 2014 but these methods are slow and often lack the diagnostic information necessary to identify the source faster methods relying on immunomagnetic fib separation followed by adenosine triphosphate quantitation have been explored zimmer faust et al 2014 however distinguishing the original source of fecal pollution is crucial in devising appropriate control prevention and risk management practices to address this need a number of molecular diagnostic technologies have been developed that allow for host identification ahmed et al 2007 bernhard and field 2000 chase et al 2012 gourmelon et al 2007 graves et al 2007 kildare et al 2007 martellini et al 2005 newton et al 2011 2013 peed et al 2011 reischer et al 2007 shanks et al 2006 viau and boehm 2011 these methods are useful due to their high levels of precision specificity and sensitivity for instance the hf183 bfdrev and humm2 quantitative pcr qpcr methods perform well for tracking human sourced fecal pollution haugland et al 2010 layton et al 2013 shanks et al 2010 molecular diagnostic techniques have been helpful in determining best management practices in complicated watersheds for examples see references riedel et al 2015 and ervin et al 2014 however successfully implementing pcr qpcr requires expensive equipment and expertise typically only available in centralized testing facilities necessitating sample shipment and associated lengthy turnaround time and high cost per test per sample isothermal nucleic acid amplification methods such as loop mediated isothermal amplification lamp can potentially rival pcr for sensitivity but in a simplified format since they do not require thermocycling boyle et al 2013 de paz et al 2014 rohrman and richards kortum 2012 however field use has often been limited by the propensity of isothermal methods like lamp to be overrun by non specific amplicons leading to false positive results abbasi et al 2016 kuboki et al 2003 tomita et al 2008 in our previous work we overcame spurious lamp signals by applying principles of nucleic acid strand exchange circuitry chakraborty et al 2016 seelig et al 2006 yin et al 2008 zhang et al 2007 to develop oligonucleotide strand displacement osd probes that like taqman probes in pcr sequence specifically transduce lamp amplicons into a readable signal jiang et al 2015 osd probes are short hemiduplex dnas in which the short single stranded region in the longer strand acts as a toehold that hybridizes to complementary sequences in lamp amplicon loops and initiates strand exchange zhang and seelig 2011 ultimately resulting in hybridization of the longer fluorophore labeled strand to the lamp loop and concomitant displacement of the quencher labeled strand the ensuing real time fluorescence accumulation allows osds to sequence specifically report single or multiplex accumulation of lamp amplicons from tens to a few hundred nucleic acid molecules with minimal interference from non specific amplicons or inhibitors bhadra et al 2015 this innovation significantly enhanced the diagnostic applicability of lamp by allowing it to match not only the sensitivity but also the specificity of real time pcr the epa approved hf183 taqman qpcr assay is one of the best performing methods designed to distinguish human fecal contamination in environmental water by identifying genetic signatures from human specific bacterial clusters belonging to the genus bacteroides boehm et al 2013 nshimyimana et al 2014 riedel et al 2014 these bacteria are ideal genetic identifiers of fecal source because they are restricted to warm blooded animals and are present in significant numbers in feces hayashi et al 2002 moreover they have a limited potential to re grow in the environment due to their anaerobic lifestyle balleste and blanch 2010 although the hf183 qpcr provides discriminating information its widespread use in water quality monitoring is difficult due to the technical expertise and expensive instruments required for execution we surmised that we could leverage the excellent human fecal specificity demonstrated by the hf183 signature sequence and create a portable inexpensive molecular assay for in field use to aid and expand water quality monitoring in the present work we demonstrate a field ready human fecal diagnostic based on a lamp osd assay intentionally designed to target the same human specific bacteroides sequence cluster also targeted by the hf183 taqman qpcr green et al 2014 to enhance portability and minimize cost we have reduced equipment needs by eliminating reagent cold chain utilizing simple and rapid sample preparation methods with syringe filters reaction warming with commercially available hand warmers and reading the output using unmodified smartphones we test the detection limit and off target reactivity of this hf183 lamp osd system and demonstrate its robust performance with a variety of environmental water sources including artificial seawater and water contaminated with humic acids 2

al 2007 shibata et al 2010 for instance primer explorer v5 was constrained to use the hf183 qpcr forward primer hf183f as the inner primer f2 region when designing lamp primer sets for human associated hf183 sequences six primer sets generated by primer explorer four sets targeting the human specific hf183 sequences and two sets targeting dog fecal bacteroides were selected for functional testing by real time lamp measured using evagreen intercalation one primer set each supplementary table t1 that amplified the fewest template copies with minimal non specific amplification was selected for assay development in the hf183primer set the b2 region of bip was complementary to sequences that partially overlap hf183 qpcr reverse primer bfdrev and taqman probe bfdfam binding sites the f1 region of fip and b1 region of bip bound to target sequences intervening the hf183f and bfdrev qpcr primer binding sites the hf183 lamp assay was subsequently appended with a fifth loop primer designed to bind to the loop sequence between the f2 and f1c regions of the amplicon an osd probe was designed to also recognize the same target region as the bacr287 hf183 qpcr primer a reverse primer demonstrated to improve the performance of hf183 qpcr and the bfdfam bthetp1 hf183 qpcr taqman probe green et al 2014 the osd probe specifically undergoes toehold mediated strand exchange with the hf183 lamp loop sequence intervening the b1 and b2c regions and was designed using our previously published design rules and the nupack software suite jiang et al 2015 zadeh et al 2011 briefly a 33 nucleotide long osd strand reporter f and its complementary 22 nucleotide long osd strand reporter q were designed to form a hemiduplex dna that displayed a single stranded toehold of 11 bp at the 5 end of reporter f the 3 end of reporter f was labeled with fluorescein while the 5 end of reporter q displayed an iowa black fq quencher moiety the 3 end of the reporter q strand was blocked against polymerase mediated extension by incorporation of an inverted dt modification lamp osd assay for the e coli uspb gene supplementary table t1 was designed de novo using the same web based tools for primer and probe design as outlined above primer design was constrained to include 40 to 60 bp loop regions for hybridization to osd probes 2 3 plasmid construction target sequences for hf183 uspb and dog fecal lamp were purchased as gene blocks from idt these gene blocks were cloned into pcr2 1topo plasmid thermo fisher waltham ma usa by gibson assembly using the 2 gibson assembly master mix from

and the reactions tubes were directly incubated for 1 h in a thermal cycler held at 60 c at the end of the incubation period osd fluorescence was imaged using an unmodified iphone 6 and an ultraslim led transilluminator syngene frederick md usa in some experiments fluorescence visualization and smartphone imaging were achieved with the aid of an imaging device 2 5 4 2 5 cm designed and 3d printed in house the imaging device was designed with a completely removable lid that also served as the rack for holding lamp osd reaction tubes for imaging one super bright blue 5 mm light emitting diode led adafruit new york ny usa per assay tube slot was placed at the bottom of the imaging box such that its blue light would hit the assay tube in the slot from the bottom an observation and imaging window was designed on one of the four faces of the cuboid device such that fluorescence emission could be captured at a 90 angle to the incident excitation source two cut to fit layers of inexpensive 500 nm bandpass orange lighting gel sheets lee filters burbank ca usa were attached to the observation window in order to filter the osd fluorescence for observation in some experiments the hf183 lamp

thick layer of cork once the inside chamber temperature reached 60 c the lamp osd reaction tubes were sandwiched in between the two hand warmer pouches a small temperature probe was also inserted in the chamber prior to closing the lid in order to monitor the temperature which steadily remained between 60 c and 63 c in replicate experiments after 1 h of incubation osd fluorescence was imaged using an iphone and an ultraslim led transilluminator or the 3d printed imaging device 2 6 hf183 taqman qpcr a previously published taqman qpcr assay was used for hf183 quantitation green et al 2014

testing included i artificial creek water acw 1 3 mm k2hpo4 1 7 mm kh2po4 7 9 mm nacl ii environmental water samples collected from a local creek waller creek austin tx usa a pond with resident fish

municipal tap water containing 20 w v or 2 w v humic acid sigma 50 ml water samples were either processed directly after collection or were spiked with different amounts of lab grown recombinant e coli phf183 bacterial colony counts were measured by plating a series of 10 fold dilutions on luria bertani agar plates containing 100 μg ml ampicillin in some experiments acw samples were spiked with primary filtered raw sewage walnut creek wastewater treatment plant austin tx usa freshly collected sewage was stored at 4 c and used within 6 h of collection in off target reactivity experiments acw was spiked with fresh feline or canine feces prior to processing for assays feces 0 464 g from a single cat were dissolved in 50 ml acw cf0 200 μl 20 μl and 2 μl of the cf0 sample were added into 50 ml acw and tested by culturing on mtec and mei plates see below and by hf183 lamp osd assays fresh sample 1 09 g from either an individual dog feces 1 dog or a mixture of nine dog feces 9 dogs were mixed in 50 ml acw df0 500 μl 200 μl or 20 μl of the df0 sample were spiked into 50 ml acw and tested by culturing on mtec and mei plates see below and by human and dog feces distinguishing lamp assays nucleic acid amplification assays water samples were placed in 60 cc syringes becton dickinson franklin lakes nj usa and manually filtered through a 0 45 μm pore size cellulose acetate syringe filter filters bearing the retentates including microbial contaminants were subsequently transferred to 1 cc syringes that were used to recover the retentate by back flushing the filters with 200 μl sterile water for some water samples such as seawater and water contaminated with humic acids the retentate bearing filters were washed by flushing through 10 ml sterile water prior to retentate recovery via back flushing with 200 μl sterile water some 5 6 μl aliquots of these 200 μl recovered retentates were directly added to lamp osd or taqman qpcr assays for assessing the presence or absence of fecal signature sequences bacterial culture based assays e coli and enterococci in water samples contaminated with primary raw sewage were enumerated by culturing on modified mtec membrane thermotolerant escherichia coli and mei membrane enterococcus indoxyl β d glucoside agar plates respectively using published epa protocols epa 2006 2009 briefly 50 ml water samples were filtered through sterile 0 45 μm pore size 47 mm diameter grid marked membrane filters using a vacuum filtration manifold filters were then removed from the filter housing and gently placed on mtec or mei plates and incubated according to their respective protocols 2 8 hf183 lamp osd lyophilization lyophilized hf183 lamp osd assays were prepared by mixing 0 25 μl of glycerol free bst 2 0 120 units μl 2 5 μl of annealed osd reporter 1 1 2 μm reporter f reporter q strands 2 μl of lamp primer mix 5 μm each of f3 and b3 20 μm each of fip and bip 10 μm of loop primer 5 μl of 4 mm dntp mix and 1 25 μl of 1 m trehalose the mixture was frozen for 15 min at 80 c and then lyophilized for 3 h using the virtis benchtop pro lyophilizer sp scientific warminster pa usa for determining storage stability replicate lyophilized assays were stored at 20 c 25 c and 42 c lyophilized lamp osd assays were functionally tested at various intervals by rehydrating with 25 μl solution containing different amounts of template 1 isothermal buffer 1 m betaine and 2 mm additional mgso4 2 9 statistical analysis real time qpcr data was analyzed using the lightcycler 96 software cq values for real time lamp osd assays were also determined using the lightcycler 96 software for lamp assays read at endpoint using a smartphone samples were scored as detected when osd fluorescence was visible after 60 min of amplification for estimating the fewest template copies that can be detected using hf183 lamp osd assays seven replicate reactions at each template amount were analyzed in real time assays while six replicates were imaged at endpoint using smartphones 3 results 3 1 hf183 lamp osd assay design a unique set of five lamp primers f3 b3 fip bip and lp and an osd probe were designed to recognize eight different target sites within a 210 bp human fecal associated sequence that encompasses the 167 bp stretch detected by the hf183f bfdrev taqman qpcr assay supplementary fig s1 since the lamp osd and taqman qpcr assays use different primers they could potentially target different populations of bacteroides to test this we subjected the 210 bp target region to basic local alignment search tool blast analysis against bacteroidales sequence database altschul et al 1990 the outer initiation primers f3 and b3 produce a 210 bp product after the initiation step the fip and bip primers exponentially amplify a 153 bp sub section of the target this 153 bp region is completely encompassed by the taqman qpcr 167 bp amplicon supplementary fig s1 jiang et al 2015 some 67 of the first 1000 blast hits demonstrated 99 100 sequence similarity and would be detectable by both hf183 lamp osd and by taqman qpcr supplementary fig s1 1 of the first 1000 hits were 97 98 similar and hence should also be detectable by both assays the remaining 32 of the top 1000 hits contained 4 6 sequence variation which would likely eliminate reactivity with both hf183 taqman qpcr and lamp osd assays these results suggest that the hf183 lamp osd assay will have a similar range of detection targets as the hf183 bfdrev taqman qpcr assay we functionally assessed this lamp osd assay by challenging it with different copies of synthetic plasmids bearing the hf183 target sequence and measuring ensuing fluorescence in real time using a pcr machine or at endpoint using a smartphone our results demonstrate that lamp osd could always detect 10 to 20 copies of hf183 fig 1 b and d which is comparable to many hf183 taqman qpcr assays green et al 2014 amplifiable plasmid copy numbers were verified by parallel examination with qpcr using hf183f and bfdrev primers along with the bfdfam taqman probe supplementary fig s2 comparison of the real time amplification kinetics of lamp osd and taqman qpcr showed that on average the hf183 lamp osd assay had a 35 min faster time to result compared to qpcr table 1 3 2 instrument free hf183 lamp osd assay for in field use in order to parse osd fluorescence with minimal hardware we built a small 2 5 4 2 5 cm 3d printed imaging device containing 470 nm light emitting diodes leds one per assay tube for fluorescence excitation and a window covered with two layers of inexpensive 500 nm band pass orange gel filter for viewing and imaging fluorescence supplementary fig s3 to maximize visual distinction of signal from background we optimized lamp osd composition by increasing the amount of deoxyribonucleotides primers enzymes and osd reporters the resulting endpoint target stimulated osd fluorescence excited by a single led in our imaging device is visible to human eyes and appears bright in smartphone camera images meanwhile background signal in the absence of target amplicons remains below the detection limit of human eyes and smartphone cmos cameras to ensure that the simplification of assay readout does not compromise detection limit we assessed the limit of detection of the smartphone imaged hf183 lamp osd assay by amplifying different copies of hf183 target dna our data fig 1c indicate that as few as 10 copies of target dna could be detected using smartphone imaging of optimized hf183 lamp osd assays assay results were independent of variations in smartphone hardware and operating system supplementary fig s3d to complement this simplification of assay readout using smartphones we tested the usability of chemical heat for maintaining temperatures suitable for isothermal amplification sandwiching the tubes between the two hand warmers produced uniform heating and also minimized the loss of volume due to evaporation and misplaced condensation supplementary fig s3a following 60 min of incubation in this chemical heat chamber the tubes were transferred to our fluorescence imaging device supplementary fig s3b and photographed using a smartphone in the presence of hf183 targets all assays produced bright fluorescence assays lacking specific templates remained dark supplementary fig s3c 3 3 rapid environmental water sample processing for direct hf183 lamp osd analysis a filtration based sample preparation method see section 2 7 was developed for in field use fig 2 a to validate this two step filter back flush sampling methodology we prepared artificial creek water samples contaminated with known amounts of laboratory grown recombinant e coli harboring the hf183 target sequence subsequently these water samples were processed using the filter back flush methodology and 6 μl aliquots from the 200 μl of processed samples were assessed directly using hf183 lamp osd assays the high temperature required for lamp is known to cause significant damage to bacterial structure mackey et al 1991 thus enabling access to and amplification of the resident nucleic acid targets smartphone images revealed that 50 ml water samples contaminated with as few as 3 6 cfu ml of recombinant e coli phf183 could be readily identified as contaminated supplementary fig s4 these results indicate that the filter back flush methodology is suitable for rapid processing of water samples for downstream lamp osd analysis similar filtration approaches have been previously used successfully to rapidly purify bacteria such as chlamydia trachomatis from infected cellular homogenates campbell et al 1991 we next sought to verify the universal applicability of our filter back flush sampling methodology for processing recreational and environmental water samples of different origins and compositions to that end we collected several samples from a local creek a pond a fountain a chlorinated swimming pool and municipal drinking water a portion of these samples was subjected directly to filtration and back flushing followed by hf183 lamp osd analysis one creek water sample was positive for hf183 by both lamp osd and by pcr suggesting the presence of human fecal contamination supplementary fig s5 none of the remaining untampered water samples generated a positive hf183 lamp osd signal a second sample set of these environmental and drinking water sources that did not suffer natural human fecal contamination was analyzed following introduction of known numbers of laboratory grown recombinant e coli harboring hf183 target dna fig 2b when the water samples were spiked with as few as 19 colony forming units ml of e coli phf183 we were able to clearly identify the contamination using our two step filter back flush sample preparation protocol followed immediately by lamp osd analysis fig 2b these results are suggestive of the suitability of our rapid sampling and isothermal diagnostic platform for analysis of many different environmental water samples to verify analytical compatibility with water laden with potential inhibitors we challenged our filter back flush sample processing method with artificial seawater containing a high concentration of monovalent salts known to inhibit bst dna polymerase ong et al 2015 seawater contaminated with recombinant e coli phf183 failed to produce a positive lamp osd signal fig 2c we surmised that the lamp osd assay might have been inhibited by excess salt introduced in the analyte upon back flushing the sample filter containing residual seawater therefore we modified the protocol by washing the filter once with 10 ml of deionized water prior to back flushing the filter to collect the bacterial retentate for hf183 lamp osd analysis e coli phf183 contaminated artificial seawater samples subjected to this three step sample processing comprising filtration and washing followed by retentate back flushing produced a clear positive signal upon hf183 lamp osd analysis fig 2c three step filter wash back flush sample processing is also efficient at reducing organic contaminants and allowing direct hf183 lamp osd analysis of humic acid containing water samples fig 2c these results demonstrate that our simple and robust three step filtration based sample processing approach integrated with the smartphone read instrument free one pot hf183 lamp osd assay fig 2a is well suited for rapid inspection of a diversity of commonly encountered water samples without requiring complex and laborious nucleic acid purification steps however one caveat in these results is the use of phf183 plasmid bearing bacteria chromosomal targets might not be as readily accessible for amplification as plasmids without nucleic acid purification since hf183 bacteroides cannot be easily cultured bae and wuertz 2009 we engineered a new lamp osd assay designed to amplify and detect a single copy e coli chromosomal gene called uspb that encodes the universal stress protein b farewell et al 1998 the uspb assay could readily detect the uspb marker in 6 cfu reaction of e coli fig 3 thermal lysis of e coli prior to assay reduced the time to detection these observations suggest that hf183 chromosomal sequences in bacteroides a gram negative bacterium like e coli should also be accessible for direct lamp osd amplification and detection 3 4 hf183 lamp osd analysis of sewage contaminated water in order to assess the robustness of our sample processing and lamp osd methodology in detecting actual human fecal contamination instead of laboratory cultured hf183 e coli we spiked 50 ml of sterile artificial creek water with different amounts of sewage primary raw sewage was collected on two separate occasions from the walnut creek wastewater treatment plant one of two major plants in austin texas with a total permitted capacity of 150 million gallons per day sewage contaminated water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm pore size syringe filters followed by back flushing of the retentate in 200 μl of sterile water of which 6 μl were directly analyzed by hf183 lamp osd assay followed by endpoint imaging with a smartphone our results demonstrate that the hf183 lamp osd assay could reliably detect the presence of as little as 1 μl and 5 μl of fresh primary sewage samples 1 and 2 respectively in 50 ml of water samples fig 4 taqman qpcr analysis of the two sewage samples determined that sewage sample 1 contained 8 7 105 copies ml of hf183 analytes while sewage 2 had 2 6 105 hf183 copies ml fig 4 and supplementary fig s6 these amounts correlate well with reported estimates of 2 105 to 8 105 hf183 copies ml of sewage sampled from many different geographic areas ahmed et al 2016 boehm et al 2015 this implies that our hf183 lamp osd assay can easily detect as few as 17 to 26 hf183 copies ml in sewage contaminated water these data suggest that our rapid sample processing methodology is efficient and the hf183 lamp osd assay can robustly operate using crude samples without significant loss in detection limit 3 5 off target activity of hf183 lamp osd assay since we engineered our hf183 lamp osd assay to utilize many of the same priming and probing sequences responsible for the fecal source specificity of the hf183 taqman qpcr we expect our hf183 lamp osd assay to demonstrate similar stringency for distinguishing human fecal contamination to verify this we challenged the hf183 lamp osd assay with different amounts of fresh feces collected from 10 canine and 1 feline pets in this proof of concept study we chose to test cross reactivity with these two fecal sources because studies report dogs and cats to be among the primary sources of fecal contamination in urban watersheds schueler 1999 these artificially contaminated water samples contained viable fecal bacteria as illustrated by enumeration of fecal indicator e coli and enterococci in duplicate water samples cultured on mtec and mei bacteriological media none of the hf183 lamp osd assays seeded with canine or feline feces accumulated osd fluorescence signal and hence remained as dark as the negative controls fig 5 a and c in contrast positive control assays seeded with hf183 templates generated bright fluorescence as a control to demonstrate the absence of inhibitors and the presence of amplifiable nucleic acids in these animal fecal samples we designed a lamp assay to amplify bacteroides molecular signatures previously used to design dog feces specific qpcr assays boehm et al 2013 dick et al 2005 kildare et al 2007 shibata et al 2010 stewart et al 2013 as seen in fig 5b water samples contaminated with canine feces elicited a clear positive signal when tested with the dog associated bacteroides lamp assay 3 6 lamp osd master mix lyophilization for storage without cold chain ready to use hf183 lamp osd master mixes replete with enzymes primers and osd probes were stored at 20 c for 60 days there was no significant loss in amplification efficiency as evident from cq values comparable to those obtained with freshly prepared assays supplementary fig s7 these master mixes will greatly simplify rapid assessment of water samples however ready to use assays that can be stably stored and shipped without cold storage are highly desirable for reducing operating costs and facilitating in field use therefore we lyophilized hf183 lamp osd master mixes containing primers osd probes deoxyribonucleotides bst 2 0 dna polymerase and the stabilizer trehalose several sets of lyophilized assays stored at 20 c 25 c or 42 c were periodically tested for function by rehydration with 1 isothermal buffer containing magnesium and betaine even after 100 days of storage at temperatures as high as 42 c the lyophilized hf183 lamp osd assays efficiently amplified hf183 dna targets resulting in accumulation of bright osd fluorescence fig 6 no signal was obtained in the absence of specific targets it should be noted that betaine and isothermal buffer are independently stable for long durations when stored without cold chain supplementary fig s8 these results further bolster the point of need applicability of our hf183 lamp osd assay system 4 discussion human fecal contamination in environmental waters is problematic due to the associated risk of disseminating hazardous pathogens and antibiotic resistance the problem is further exacerbated by climate changes natural and man made disasters zolnikov 2013 and failing infrastructures the need to invest in innovative diagnostic technologies for resource recovery and for monitoring pollution sources is well recognized young et al 2015 high quality informative and actionable data is not only important for supporting the health of a water body but is key for guiding policy and investment towards best management practices development of new diagnostic approaches education of the next generation of water professionals and facilitation of data collection are the keys to achieving global improvement in water quality young et al 2015 advanced qpcr based molecular diagnostic methods to pinpoint sources of fecal contamination have been developed with the hope of achieving these goals however these methods need complicated instruments and highly trained operators unfortunately infrastructure is expensive and there exists a severe gap in the technically trained human resource crocker et al 2016 iwa 2014 these limitations have prevented widespread adoption of qpcr methods into water monitoring regimens we have developed a low cost rapid easy to use platform technology for in field detection of human fecal nucleic acid signatures in environmental and drinking water our technology effectively integrates the amplification power of lamp and the sequence specificity of dna computational osd probes to identify as few as 17 to 26 copies of bacteroides hf183 sequences ml indicative of human feces in minimally processed sewage contaminated water samples with no cross reactivity to dog or feline feces ancillary design details have been tailored to facilitate robustness portability and widespread in field use by reducing the need for expensive instruments technical education and laborious user required processes these design details include i minimization of procedural complexity one pot visually readable assays directly analyze crudely concentrated samples without requiring nucleic acid purification ii elimination of complex instruments or data analytics visual yes no assay readout allows easy assessment of the presence or absence of contamination without iii data accessibility ability to capture lamp osd signal with unmodified smartphones allows rapid data sharing through networks and iv infrastructure cost reduction lyophilized master mixes storable without cold chain reduce operation and distribution cost these design innovations have also allowed us to achieve reliable sample to answer testing results within only 80 min of sampling not only is this a sizeable acceleration over current qpcr or culture based tests that require several hours to days to produce results but due to the on site applicability our test also dismantles the time and monetary cost of sample storage and shipment one criticism that might be raised is the inability of hf183 lamp osd to provide a quantitative determination of the level of contamination to address this concern we have recently developed a robust field usable technology for semi quantitative lamp that enables reliable measurement of initial target copies on an order of magnitude scale via a simple one time determination of the presence or absence of visible osd fluorescence at reaction endpoint jiang et al 2017 osd fluorescence amplitude is rendered a function of initial target copies by diverting replicative resources from these true targets to defined numbers of competing false targets that display the same primer binding sites and amplification kinetics but lack osd complementarity we have successfully used these one pot semi quantitative lamp osd reactions to directly and quantitatively estimate the numbers of hf183 nucleic acids in sewage with the values obtained closely correlating with hf183 taqman qpcr quantitation jiang et al 2017 importantly semi quantitative hf183 lamp osd reactions are amenable to endpoint readout via smartphone unlike other methods such as qpcr that require continuous monitoring and should therefore remain extremely useful for in field water quality monitoring without any sophisticated instrumentation or informatics in ongoing efforts we are expanding the test suite of the lamp osd platform to allow more comprehensive fecal pollution tracking of non human sources as well as direct detection of water borne pathogens ultimately the utility of the lamp osd platform technology goes beyond water quality testing the modular nature of the robust platform should allow rapid prototyping of sample processing methods and assays to detect almost any nucleic acid sequence signature in desired specimens 5 conclusions we have developed a low cost easy to use molecular test to rapidly identify human fecal contamination in water by detecting as few as 17 copies ml of human associated bacteroides hf183 sequence with no off target signal from dog or cat feces this platform technology has low power requirements and is engineered for on site sample to answer testing of minimally processed water samples without needing nucleic acid purification as a result our technology can bridge the gap in technically trained human resource by i allowing citizen scientists with minimal expertise to actionably monitor water quality and ii serving as a low cost easy to use teaching tool for educating the next generation of experts we anticipate that these features would enhance adoption in routine monitoring and would be invaluable during emergencies presented by infrastructure failure and disruption unlike current bacteriological and molecular methods that require several hours to days to produce results rapid in field generation of information would expedite action and allow individuals to lobby for improved water quality and affect water quality change in their communities acknowledgments funding this work

19782,to achieve energy neutral wastewater treatment mainstream anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox has attracted extensive attention in the past decade however the relatively high effluent nitrogen concentration 10 mg n l 1 remains a significant barrier hindering its practical implementation a novel technology integrating the anammox and denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation damo reactions in a membrane biofilm reactor mbfr was developed in this study to enhance the mainstream anammox process with the hydraulic retention time hrt progressively decreased from 12 to 4 h the total nitrogen tn removal rate increased stepwise from 0 09 to 0 28 kg n m 3 d 1 with an effluent tn concentration below 3 0 mg n l 1 achieved mass balance analysis showed that 30 60 of the nitrate produced by the anammox reaction was reduced back to nitrite by damo archaea and the anammox and damo bacteria were jointly responsible for nitrite removal with contributions of 90 and 10 respectively additionally the established mbfr was robust and achieved consistently high effluent quality with 90 tn removal when the influent nitrite to ammonium molar ratio varied in the range of 1 17 1 55 fluorescence in situ hybridization fish and 16s rrna gene sequencing indicated that anammox bacteria damo bacteria and damo archaea jointly dominated the biofilm and were likely the key contributors to nitrogen removal this is the first study that a high nitrogen removal rate 0 2 kg n m 3 d 1 and satisfactory effluent quality 3 mg tn l 1 were achieved simultaneously by integrating anammox and damo reactions

consumption kartal et al 2010 while the autotrophic nitrogen removal process also called the deammonification process has been widely applied to high strength wastewaters such as the anaerobic sludge digestion liquor with over 100 full scale installations worldwide lackner et al 2014 studies on the mainstream anammox process are still underway the anammox bacteria are known to grow slowly jetten et al 2001 and hence the biomass aggregate types enabling their retention are required wang and zheng 2017 these included the granular sludge with good settling ability li et al 2016 lotti et al 2014a ma et al 2013 and the biofilms attached on the carriers in moving bed biofilm reactors mbbrs gilbert et al 2014 laureni et al 2016 trojanowicz et al 2016 however one of the major concerns for the current mainstream anammox process designs is the relatively poor effluent quality with a total nitrogen tn concentration above 10 mg n l 1 in most cases de clippeleir et al 2013 lackner et al 2015 li et al 2016 lotti et al 2014a ma et al 2013 the nitrate accumulation resulting from the anammox reaction 1 nh4 1 32no2 1 02n2 0 26no3 2 03h2o and the varying nitrite to ammonium ratio from mainstream partial nitritation are the most significant contributing factors to this problem membrane biofilm reactor mbfr has recently been proposed as an alternative reactor design for the nitrogen removal from nitrogen rich wastewater streams such as the anaerobic sludge digestion liquor xie et al 2017 the slowly growing anammox bacteria are retained in the biofilms on the surface of membranes the provision of gaseous methane through the lumen of gas permeable hollow fibers enabled the growth of denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation damo organisms ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 raghoebarsing et al 2006 along with anammox bacteria with methane as the electron donor these damo organisms utilized the nitrate produced by anammox reaction and the nitrite not consumed by anammox bacteria as the terminal electron acceptors it was found that both types of the currently known damo organisms namely the bacterial candidatus methylomirabilis oxyfera affiliated to the nc10 phylum ettwig et al 2010 and archaeal candidatus methanoperedens nitroreducens anme 2d distantly related to other anaerobic methanotrophic archaea anme haroon et al 2013 grew in such biofilms shi et al 2013 concomitant with anaerobic methane oxidation damo archaea reduced nitrate to nitrite 2 ch4 4no3 co2 4no2 2h2o and damo bacteria converted nitrite to dinitrogen gas 3 3ch4 8no2 8h 3co2 4n2 10h2o the presences of damo organisms reduced the accumulation of nitrate produced by anammox bacteria and also removed the additional nitrite in case the feed contains nitrite and ammonium at a ratio non ideal for the anammox reaction both of these features helped to improve the effluent quality through integrating anammox and damo microorganisms in mbfrs cai et al 2015 obtained a high nitrate removal rate of 0 7 kg n m 3 d 1 while xie et al 2017 achieved complete nitrogen removal 99 from partially nitrified anaerobic sludge digestion liquor however it is well recognized that different from anaerobic sludge digestion liquor the mainstream wastewater has significantly lower temperature 10 25 c vs 35 c and also much lower nitrogen concentration 20 60 mg tn l 1 vs 500 1500 mg tn l 1 lotti et al 2014b the latter implies that a shorter hydraulic retention time hrt e g 12 h is required to achieve a desirable nitrogen loading rate de clippeleir et al 2011 until now the nitrogen removal efficiency for mainstream wastewater treatment is typically below 85 leading to an effluent tn concentration above 10 mg n l 1 gilbert et al 2014 hendrickx et al 2012 laureni et al 2016 lotti et al 2014a ma et al 2013 the present work aims at obtaining satisfactory effluent quality 5 mg n l 1 at a practical nitrogen removal rate 0 2 kg n m 3 d 1 from mainstream wastewater through integrating anammox and damo microorganisms in an mbfr supplied with methane which is readily available in biogas to this end a laboratory mbfr fed with synthetic wastewater mimicking the effluent from mainstream partial nitritation was set up and operated for around 2 years at ambient temperature to increase the volumetric nitrogen removal rate the hrt was decreased progressively during the course of the experiment two series of independent batch tests were undertaken to verify the mass balance and the impacts of influent nitrite to ammonium ratio microbial analysis was conducted through fluorescence in situ hybridization fish and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing to unravel the functional microbial community 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor configuration and setup the mbfr used has a total volume of 2356 ml the reactor was equipped with 12 bundles of membrane modules for methane delivery taking up a volume of 56 ml 45 ml of fiber materials and 11 ml of fiber lumen each bundle comprised 500 non porous polypropylene hollow fibers teijin fibers ltd japan with a length of 30 cm and inner and outer diameters of 90 μm and 200 μm respectively the total membrane surface area was 1 13 m2 giving rise to an area volume ratio of 491 m2 m3 the membrane modules were connected to a methane cylinder 95 ch4 and 5 co2 the lumen pressure was set to be 300 kpa regulated and monitored with a gas gauge ross brown australia as delineated in fig 1 the bulk liquid was recirculated by a peristaltic pump masterflex l s usa passing a 330 ml overflow bottle equipped with a ph meter oakton australia a liquid sampling point and a gas sampling point the ph was maintained at 7 0 0 5 through dosing 1 m hcl or 1 m naoh manually the water seal bottle was used for gas and liquid release preventing air back diffusion into the reactor feed to the reactor was provided with a peristaltic pump bt300 2j longerpump china from 50 l feed bottle containing synthetic wastewater a 20 l gas bag tedlar australia filled with nitrogen gas was connected to the feed bottle to keep the influent oxygen free the nitrogen species compositions in the feed are summarized in table 1 with trace elements in the growth medium prepared according to ettwig et al 2009 2 2 operational strategies the mbfr was inoculated with 400 ml biomass from a parent reactor consisting of anammox and damo microorganisms and operated for 730 days the study comprised two phases namely the start up phase and the continuous phase table 1 for the start up phase day 1 202 stock solutions of ammonium chloride 46 g nh4 n l 1 and sodium nitrite 46 g no2 n l 1 were periodically dosed into the overflow bottle to maintain the concentrations of ammonium and nitrite in the range of 0 130 and 0 25 mg n l 1 respectively during this phase substrates were provided through addition of concentrated stock solutions hence no effluent discharge was necessary which prevented the washout of biomass and allowed biofilms to develop from day 203 onward the synthetic mainstream wastewater containing 25 0 mg nh4 n l 1 and 26 5 mg no2 n l 1 was fed into the reactor continuously the no2 n to nh4 n ratio of 1 06 was determined based on the stoichiometry of anammox and damo reactions with the assumption that all the nitrite fed in the influent and produced by damo archaea would be removed through the anammox pathway to increase the nitrogen loading rate the hrt was progressively reduced from 12 h to 9 h and then to 6 h on day 360 and 424 respectively from day 568 the influent nitrite and ammonium concentrations were changed to 29 5 and 22 mg n l 1 respectively the new no2 n to nh4 n ratio of 1 34 was chosen based on the reaction stoichiometry observed in the previous period with the aim to achieve satisfactory effluent quality with a tn concentration below 5 mg n l 1 when the steady state of continuous phase iv was reached the hrt was further decreased to 4 h to test the ability of the established mbfr to cope with an even higher nitrogen loading rate during the entire course of the experiment liquid samples were then taken from the overflow bottle regularly once a day to monitor the nh4 no2 and no3 concentrations in the mbfr on day 595 biofilm samples were collected to elucidate the microbial community 2 3 batch tests following the long term operation described above the reactor hrt was returned to 9 h the preferred hrt based on the long term results two series of batch tests were performed when a new steady state was reached batch tests set a was undertaken to investigate the impact of influent nitrite to ammonium ratio nine runs with different influent nitrite to ammonium ratios i e 1 06 1 12 1 17 1 22 1 28 1 34 1 39 1 44 and 1 55 were carried out consecutively each lasting for 2 days in all these tests the influent tn concentration was kept constant at 51 5 mg n l 1 liquid samples were taken every 12 h from the overflow bottle to determine the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n batch tests set b was conducted to identify the nitrogen turnover rate of each organism and verify the overall mass balance the reactor was disconnected from the gas cylinder to stop the methane supply one day before the test leading to methane depletion freshly prepared medium containing 100 mg nh4 n l 1 was sparged with nitrogen for 20 min to remove oxygen and then flushed with methane for another 15 min to produce a dissolved methane concentration of approximate 20 mg ch4 l 1 this specifically prepared feed of 10 l was then pumped into the mbfr to replenish the reactor liquid a nitrite stock solution 32 g no2 n l 1 was subsequently dosed into the reactor via the overflow bottle to produce a theoretical nitrite concentration about 25 mg no2 n l 1 liquid samples were then taken from the overflow bottle every hour for about 6 h to measure the variations of nh4 no2 and no3 gas samples were also taken from the headspace of the overflow bottle hourly for the analysis of methane partial pressure in the gas phase the concentration of dissolved methane was calculated from the gas phase data using henry s law when nitrite was removed completely the ammonium and nitrite stock solutions was dosed again to repeat the experiment for two more times 2 4 chemical analytical methods liquid samples were taken from the overflow bottle with 1 5 ml syringes and filtered immediately through 0 22 μm disposable sterile millipore filters merck the concentrations of no2 n no3 n and nh4 n were assayed with a lachat quickchem8000 flow injection analyzer lachat instrument milwaukee wi for the gas measurements 0 1 ml gas samples were taken from the headspace of the overflow bottle to measure the concentration of methane through a gas chromatograph agilent gc7890a using argon as the carrier gas the biological nitrogen conversion rates facilitated by the anammox and damo reactions reactions 1 3 were determined from the measured ammonium nitrite and nitrate consumption rates supplementary information si 2 5 microbial analysis dna was extracted using fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals santa ana ca usa according to the manufacturer s instructions the 16s rrna gene amplification sequencing and analysis were undertaken following the procedures described in hülsen et al 2016 fish was also conducted following the protocols described in ettwig et al 2008 more details of the methods are described in si 3 results 3 1 long term nitrogen removal performance the mbfr was established and operated for 730 days involving two phases i e the start up phase and the continuous phase the long term nitrogen removal performance is illustrated in fig 2 upon inoculation sodium nitrite and ammonium chloride stock solutions were pulse dosed into the reactor to cultivate the biofilm 0 202 days both the ammonium and nitrite removal rates progressively increased reaching around 50 mg n l 1 d 1 at the end of the start up phase the tn removal rate was relatively stable at about 100 mg n l 1 d 1 from day 123 202 fig 2a based on the nitrogen removal rate on day 202 an initial hrt of 12 h was selected for the continuous phase that started on day 203 during continuous phase i day 203 359 the average nitrite concentration in effluent was 0 3 mg n l 1 while the ammonium concentration varied in the range of 4 5 7 8 mg n l 1 fig 2b the nitrate concentration decreased stepwise from 7 5 to below 2 5 mg n l 1 indicating the enhanced activities of damo archaea on day 359 the nitrite and ammonium removal rates were 41 0 and 52 0 mg n l 1 d 1 respectively giving rise to a tn removal rate of 88 1 mg n l 1 d 1 fig 2a to further increase the nitrogen loading rate the hrt was decreased from 12 h to 9 h and then to 6 h following the increases of nitrogen loading rate the effluent nitrite concentration increased to 0 6 0 9 mg n l 1 temporarily but declined to 0 mg n l 1 after two month adaption in both phase ii and iii fig 2b meanwhile the effluent nitrate concentration further dropped to 0 6 mg n l 1 on day 421 at hrt of 9 h and maintained relatively stable at approximately 2 5 mg n l 1 at hrt of 6 h unlike nitrite and nitrate the effluent ammonium concentration was always above 5 mg n l 1 in phase i iii fig 2b the low eluent nitrite concentration 1 0 mg n l 1 indicated that nitrite was a limiting substrate for the anammox reaction and was likely responsible for the incomplete ammonium removal therefore the influent nitrite to ammonium ratio was increased from 1 06 to 1 34 on day 568 to improve ammonium removal while the influent tn concentration remained at 51 5 mg n l 1 the effluent ammonium quickly dropped from 5 5 mg n l 1 on day 587 to 0 3 mg n l 1 on day 569 and then to 0 mg n l 1 on day 602 fig 2b at this point nitrate became the only nitrogenous species in effluent which peaked at 3 6 mg n l 1 and then gradually decreased to 2 6 mg n l 1 on day 630 giving rise to a tn removal efficiency of 94 the nitrite and ammonium removal rates in the steady state of this phase were 116 0 and 87 8 mg n l 1 d 1 respectively on day 640 the hrt was further decreased to 4 h the nitrate concentration in effluent increased to 5 2 mg n l 1 on day 647 but then gradually decreased and fluctuated around 4 mg n l 1 for the rest of experiment both the ammonium and nitrite concentrations in effluent remained stable at levels around 0 5 and 0 3 mg n l 1 respectively fig 2b with the stepwise decrease of hrt from 12 to 4 h the tn removal rate increased from 0 09 to 0 28 kg n m 3 d 1 fig 2a 3 2 impact of short term variation of influent nitrite to ammonium ratio after the long term operation the impact of influent nitrite to ammonium ratio on the nitrogen removal performance was investigated at hrt of 9 h a high level tn removal efficiency at 91 7 94 7 was obtained when the nitrite to ammonium ratio varied in the range of 1 17 1 55 table 2 indicating the established mbfr was robust to the ratio variation in this range interestingly though the nitrite removal efficiency declined to 97 8 when the nitrite to ammonium ratio was increased to 1 55 the tn removal efficiency still remained above 94 in comparison when the ratio was decreased to 1 06 ammonium accumulation was observed and the ammonium conversion efficiency dropped to 81 7 leading to a significant deterioration of the overall nitrogen removal performance these results are consistent with the long term data of continuous phase indicating that the system is more robust towards higher nitrite concentration than higher ammonium concentration 3 3 nitrogen conversion by key reactions after the long term operation batch tests set b was undertaken at hrt of 9 h to determine the rates of the key reactions reactions 1 3 based on mass balance the concentrations of ammonium and nitrite decreased simultaneously upon each addition of nitrite whilst nitrate accumulated initially but decreased when nitrite was fully consumed fig s1 concomitant to the variations of nitrogen species methane was consumed during the batch test fig s1 the measured methane consumption rate was statistically identical to that predicted by reactions 1 3 table s1 which strongly suggested that reactions 1 3 were the key reactions in the mbfr and that the contributions of heterotrophic denitrifiers were negligible supported by the mass balance results above the contributions by each of the three key reactions were calculated si and presented in fig 3 the anammox reaction was responsible for most 90 of the nitrite removed while damo bacteria contributed to less than 10 fig 3a specifically the nitrite removal rate of damo bacteria remained below 5 mg n l 1 d 1 in continuous phase i and then increased stepwise to around 17 5 mg n l 1 d 1 on day 441 in phase ii as the experiment continued the nitrite removal rate by damo bacteria dropped quickly to below 5 mg n l 1 d 1 on day 567 and remained low in the remaining phase iii in contrast the activity of anammox bacteria increased stepwise with nitrite removal rate elevated from 50 2 to 173 7 mg n l 1 d 1 progressively from phase i to phase v when the influent nitrite to ammonium ratio was increased from 1 06 to 1 34 in phase iv and v anammox bacteria contributed to more than 97 of the total nitrite removal while damo bacteria activity remained below 3 mg n l 1 d 1 notwithstanding its significant role in alleviating the impact of influent nitrite to ammonium ratio variations the nitrate production rate of anammox bacteria and the nitrate removal rate of damo archaea are shown in fig 3b while the nitrate production rate kept pace with the enhanced anammox activity the nitrate removal rate increased gradually from negligible levels at the beginning of the continuous phase to 10 2 mg n l 1 d 1 on day 422 and remained at this level for the remaining period despite of some short term variations caused by the changes in feed 3 4 microbial community characterization fish and 16s rrna gene sequencing were undertaken to investigate the functional microbial community in the mbfr biofilm the fish images confirmed the presences of anammox bacteria red damo bacteria blue and damo archaea green fig 4 a pyrosequencing analyses revealed that at phylum level the dominant microbes on day 595 were planctomycetes nc10 proteobacteria chloroflexi chlorobi od1 euryarchaeota armatimonadetes with relative abundance of 25 18 16 14 9 4 3 and 3 respectively fig 4b both types of the currently known damo organisms i e damo bacteria and damo archaea were found in the biofilm all the sequences detected in the nc10 phylum fell within the family of methylomirabiliaceae with 18 relative abundance which is well recognized as the nitrite dependent anaerobic methane oxidation bacteria ettwig et al 2010 the archaea 3 identified in the mbfr were affiliated to the methanoperedenaceae family with known ability to couple nitrate reduction with anaerobic methane oxidation haroon et al 2013 further the brocadiae belonging to the planctomycetes phylum with relative abundance of 3 has previously been confirmed to be able to carry out the anammox reaction jetten et al 2009 at the class level phycisphaerae with the highest abundance of 22 has previously been detected in other damo hu et al 2015 xie et al 2017 and anammox cultures liu et al 2017 however their roles in all these systems remain to be elucidated similarly both the anaerolineae 14 and ignavibacteria 9 classes have been found in previous anammox gilbert et al 2014 li et al 2016 and damo hu et al 2015 lu et al 2016 systems the anaerolineae class within chloroflexi phylum has been verified to be able to utilize organic carbon derived from cell lysis cao et al 2016 kindaichi et al 2012 and has also been shown to play roles in the granulation process gao et al 2011 chlorobi phylum dominated by the class of ignavibacteria has been indicated as polysaccharides scavenger in a full scale anammox reactor gonzalez gil et al 2015 the betaproteobacteria 15 and gammaproteobacteria 1 classes belonging to the proteobacteria phylum have recently been hypothesized to be able to compete for nitrite with anammox and couple nitrate reduction with the oxidation of anammox bacteria metabolites gonzalez gil et al 2015 both the aby1 class 4 affiliated to the od1 phylum and the fimbriimonadia class 3 related to the armatimonadetes phylum were observed in a full scale anammox reactor previously speth et al 2016 the aby1 class has been assumed to be able to cope with the nitrite fluctuation due to the presence of nitrite reductase nirk in the genome speth et al 2016 4 discussion a novel mbfr based technology is demonstrated in this study to achieve high level nitrogen removal under mainstream conditions through coupling anammox with damo processes although the concept of integrating anammox and damo organisms in an mbfr has been proposed in previous studies cai et al 2015 shi et al 2013 xie et al 2017 this is the first study to investigate and demonstrate the feasibility of achieving high level nitrogen removal from domestic strength wastewater through the use of such an mbfr a relatively high nitrogen removal rate of 0 2 kg n m 3 d 1 was achieved with satisfactory effluent quality tn concentration below 5 mg n l 1 it appears that an hrt of 6 9 h is suitable for such a system as summarized in table 3 the tn removal rate previously reported for the mainstream anammox process varied in a broad range of 0 02 0 55 kg n m 3 d 1 at 20 c de clippeleir et al 2013 gilbert et al 2014 han et al 2016 hendrickx et al 2012 li et al 2016 lotti et al 2014b the nitrogen removal rates achieved in the present study 0 2 0 3 kg n m 3 d 1 are comparable to these rates and are suitable for practical applications however the effluent quality achieved in most previous mainstream anammox studies was relatively poor with tn concentration of 6 20 mg n l 1 table 3 a key reason for the high effluent tn concentration was the nitrate accumulation this issue was addressed in this study by the inclusion of damo processes enabled by the provision of methane from permeable hollow fibers in the present study the average effluent tn concentration was 3 1 and 5 2 mg n l 1 at hrt of 6 h and 4 h respectively these levels are acceptable in most regions based on the standards applied directive 1991 epa 2002 voudouris and voutsa 2012 the removal of nitrate produced from anammox reaction by the damo archaea was the major reason for the much reduced effluent tn level table 3 at an hrt of 6 9 h 50 60 of the nitrate produced from the anammox reaction was reduced to nitrite by damo archaea which was further reduced to dinitrogen gas jointly by anammox and damo bacteria however when the hrt was reduced to 4 h the nitrate removal efficiency dropped to approximately 30 it appears that the ability of damo archaea to reduce nitrate could potentially be a key factor determining the hrt applicable another critical reason for the relatively high effluent tn for an anammox system is that a strict nitrite to ammonium molar ratio of 1 32 1 is required for the complete removal of both substrates when such a ratio is not satisfied one of the two substrates would remain in the effluent this requirement is relaxed in the mbfr proposed which couples the anammox and damo processes this study demonstrated that nearly complete removal 96 of both ammonium and nitrite could be achieved when the nitrite to ammonium ratio varied in the range of 1 22 1 55 table 2 this is because of the presence of damo bacteria which are able to remove the additional amount of nitrite when it is in excess this is a highly useful feature as the partial nitritation step will unlikely be able to deliver an effluent with a strictly constant nitrite to ammonium ratio of 1 32 as shown in fig 3 the contributions of the anammox and damo bacteria to the nitrite removal were 90 and 10 respectively during normal operation the relatively high abundance of methylomirabiliaceae 18 apparently did not result in a high damo bacterial activity the abundance of a microorganism is only one contributing factor to the microbial activity which is also influenced by the maximal growth rate and substrate affinities of the organism on the other hand the abundance of a microorganism is affected by not only its growth but also its decay rate unfortunately there is currently not enough information available to link the activity of damo organisms to their abundance this also means that the mbfr delivered operational flexibility with a relatively low consumption of methane for nitrite reduction analogous to the achievements in the present study another methane based mbfr also obtained high level nitrogen removal from anaerobic sludge digestion liquor previously xie et al 2017 it appears that the mbfr coupling anammox and damo reactions is a suitable bio reactor structure to achieve excellent effluent quality under both mainstream and sidestream conditions both reactors demonstrated robust performance when the influent nitrite to ammonium ratio varied the influent nitrogen concentration in the simulated mainstream wastewater used in this study had a total nitrogen concentration of 51 5 mg n l 1 approximately 5 that applied to the sidestream mbfr however the mainstream mbfr was able to achieve a nitrogen removal rate of 275 mg n l 1 d 1 i e 27 5 of that achieved with the sidestream mbfr through the use of a much shorter hrt 4 vs 24 h this indicates that the mbfr can work with a wide range of hrt a major common challenge for both reactors is the relatively long start up time resulting from the limited inoculum and the long doubling time of damo cultures raghoebarsing et al 2006 further research is needed to develop strategies to enable quicker start up 5 conclusions in this study a lab scale mbfr integrating the anammox and damo reactions was developed to remove nitrogen from mainstream partially nitrified wastewater the major conclusions and outcomes are the membrane biofilm reactor is a suitable configuration to couple anammox and damo microorganisms for mainstream wastewater treatment a high nitrogen removal rate 0 2 kg n m 3 d 1 was obtained along with satisfactory effluent quality below 5 mg tn l 1 under mainstream conditions the removal of nitrate produced from anammox reaction by damo archaea contributed significantly to the improvement in effluent quality compared to other mainstream anammox processes using granular sludge or mbbr biofilms the mbfr was robust against the variations in influent nitrite to ammonium ratio a high level nitrogen removal was achieved when the ratio varied in the range of 1 17 1 55 acknowledgements we thank dr beatrice

19782,to achieve energy neutral wastewater treatment mainstream anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox has attracted extensive attention in the past decade however the relatively high effluent nitrogen concentration 10 mg n l 1 remains a significant barrier hindering its practical implementation a novel technology integrating the anammox and denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation damo reactions in a membrane biofilm reactor mbfr was developed in this study to enhance the mainstream anammox process with the hydraulic retention time hrt progressively decreased from 12 to 4 h the total nitrogen tn removal rate increased stepwise from 0 09 to 0 28 kg n m 3 d 1 with an effluent tn concentration below 3 0 mg n l 1 achieved mass balance analysis showed that 30 60 of the nitrate produced by the anammox reaction was reduced back to nitrite by damo archaea and the anammox and damo bacteria were jointly responsible for nitrite removal with contributions of 90 and 10 respectively additionally the established mbfr was robust and achieved consistently high effluent quality with 90 tn removal when the influent nitrite to ammonium molar ratio varied in the range of 1 17 1 55 fluorescence in situ hybridization fish and 16s rrna gene sequencing indicated that anammox bacteria damo bacteria and damo archaea jointly dominated the biofilm and were likely the key contributors to nitrogen removal this is the first study that a high nitrogen removal rate 0 2 kg n m 3 d 1 and satisfactory effluent quality 3 mg tn l 1 were achieved simultaneously by integrating anammox and damo reactions in mainstream wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords nitrogen removal denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation anammox membrane biofilm reactor mainstream 1 introduction there is an on going paradigm shift in wastewater treatment from pollutant removal to resource recovery the so called a b process one of the new conceptual designs has attracted extensive attention recently xu et al 2015 it comprises upfront organic carbon separation for bioenergy recovery a stage malovanyy et al 2015 rattier et al 2015 and the subsequent autotrophic nitrogen removal b stage driven by ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox bacteria jetten et al 1997 mulder et al 1995 strous et al 1999 compared with conventional wastewater treatment processes the new design achieves nitrogen removal without the need for organic carbon thus driving wastewater treatment plants wwtps towards energy neutrality through much enhanced energy recovery as well as reduced energy consumption kartal et al 2010 while the autotrophic nitrogen removal process also called the deammonification process has been widely applied to high strength wastewaters such as the anaerobic sludge digestion liquor with over 100 full scale installations worldwide lackner et al 2014 studies on the mainstream anammox process are still underway the anammox bacteria are known to grow slowly jetten et al 2001 and hence the biomass aggregate types enabling their retention are required wang and zheng 2017 these included the granular sludge with good settling ability li et al 2016 lotti et al 2014a ma et al 2013 and the biofilms attached on the carriers in moving bed biofilm reactors mbbrs gilbert et al 2014 laureni et al 2016 trojanowicz et al 2016 however one of the major concerns for the current mainstream anammox process designs is the relatively poor effluent quality with a total nitrogen tn concentration above 10 mg n l 1 in most cases de clippeleir et al 2013 lackner et al 2015 li et al 2016 lotti et al 2014a ma et al 2013 the nitrate accumulation resulting from the anammox reaction 1 nh4 1 32no2 1 02n2 0 26no3 2 03h2o and the varying nitrite to ammonium ratio from mainstream partial nitritation are the most significant contributing factors to this problem membrane biofilm reactor mbfr has recently been proposed as an alternative reactor design for the nitrogen removal from nitrogen rich wastewater streams such as the anaerobic sludge digestion liquor xie et al 2017 the slowly growing anammox bacteria are retained in the biofilms on the surface of membranes the provision of gaseous methane through the lumen of gas permeable hollow fibers enabled the growth of denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation damo organisms ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 raghoebarsing et al 2006 along with anammox bacteria with methane as the electron donor these damo organisms utilized the nitrate produced by anammox reaction and the nitrite not consumed by anammox bacteria as the terminal electron acceptors it was found that both types of the currently known damo organisms namely the bacterial candidatus methylomirabilis oxyfera affiliated to the nc10 phylum ettwig et al 2010 and archaeal candidatus methanoperedens nitroreducens anme 2d distantly related to other anaerobic methanotrophic archaea anme haroon et al 2013 grew in such biofilms shi et al 2013 concomitant with anaerobic methane oxidation damo archaea reduced nitrate to nitrite 2 ch4 4no3 co2 4no2 2h2o and damo bacteria converted nitrite to dinitrogen gas 3 3ch4 8no2 8h 3co2 4n2 10h2o the presences of damo organisms reduced the accumulation of nitrate produced by anammox bacteria and also removed the additional nitrite in case the feed contains nitrite and ammonium at a ratio non ideal for the anammox reaction both of these features helped to improve the effluent quality through integrating anammox and damo microorganisms in mbfrs cai et al 2015 obtained a high nitrate removal rate of 0 7 kg n m 3 d 1 while xie et al 2017 achieved complete nitrogen removal 99 from partially nitrified anaerobic sludge digestion liquor however it is well recognized that different from anaerobic sludge digestion liquor the mainstream wastewater has significantly lower temperature 10 25 c vs 35 c and also much lower nitrogen concentration 20 60 mg tn l 1 vs 500 1500 mg tn l 1 lotti et al 2014b the latter implies that a shorter hydraulic retention time hrt e g 12 h is required to achieve a desirable nitrogen loading rate de clippeleir et al 2011 until now the nitrogen removal efficiency for mainstream wastewater treatment is typically below 85 leading to an effluent tn concentration above 10 mg n l 1 gilbert et al 2014 hendrickx et al 2012 laureni et al 2016 lotti et al 2014a ma et al 2013 the present work aims at obtaining satisfactory effluent quality 5 mg n l 1 at a practical nitrogen removal rate 0 2 kg n m 3 d 1 from mainstream wastewater through integrating anammox and damo microorganisms in an mbfr supplied with methane which is readily available in biogas to this end a laboratory mbfr fed with synthetic wastewater mimicking the effluent from mainstream partial nitritation was set up and operated for around 2 years at ambient temperature to increase the volumetric nitrogen removal rate the hrt was decreased progressively during the course of the experiment two series of independent batch tests were undertaken to verify the mass balance and the impacts of influent nitrite to ammonium ratio microbial analysis was conducted through fluorescence in situ hybridization fish and 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing to unravel the functional microbial community 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor configuration and setup the mbfr used has a total volume of 2356 ml the reactor was equipped with 12 bundles of membrane modules for methane delivery taking up a volume of 56 ml 45 ml of fiber materials and 11 ml of fiber lumen each bundle comprised 500 non porous polypropylene hollow fibers teijin fibers ltd japan with a length of 30 cm and inner and outer diameters of 90 μm and 200 μm respectively the total membrane surface area was 1 13 m2 giving rise to an area volume ratio of 491 m2 m3 the membrane modules were connected to a methane cylinder 95 ch4 and 5 co2 the lumen pressure was set to be 300 kpa regulated and monitored with a gas gauge ross brown australia as delineated in fig 1 the bulk liquid was recirculated by a peristaltic pump masterflex l s usa passing a 330 ml overflow bottle equipped with a ph meter oakton australia a liquid sampling point and a gas sampling point the ph was maintained at 7 0 0 5 through dosing 1 m hcl or 1 m naoh manually the water seal bottle was used for gas and liquid release preventing air back diffusion into the reactor feed to the reactor was provided with a peristaltic pump bt300 2j longerpump china from 50 l feed bottle containing synthetic wastewater a 20 l gas bag tedlar australia filled with nitrogen gas was connected to the feed bottle to keep the influent oxygen free the nitrogen species compositions in the feed are summarized in table 1 with trace elements in the growth medium prepared according to ettwig et al 2009 2 2 operational strategies the mbfr was inoculated with 400 ml biomass from a parent reactor consisting of anammox and damo microorganisms and operated for 730 days the study comprised two phases namely the start up phase and the continuous phase table 1 for the start up phase day 1 202 stock solutions of ammonium chloride 46 g nh4 n l 1 and sodium nitrite 46 g no2 n l 1 were periodically dosed into the overflow bottle to maintain the concentrations of ammonium and nitrite in the range of 0 130 and 0 25 mg n l 1 respectively during this phase substrates were provided through addition of concentrated stock solutions hence no effluent discharge was necessary which prevented the washout of biomass and allowed biofilms to develop from day 203 onward the synthetic mainstream wastewater containing 25 0 mg nh4 n l 1 and 26 5 mg no2 n l 1 was fed into the reactor continuously the no2 n to nh4 n ratio of 1 06 was determined based on the stoichiometry of anammox and damo reactions with the assumption that all the nitrite fed in the influent and produced by damo archaea would be removed through the anammox pathway to increase the nitrogen loading rate the hrt was progressively reduced from 12 h to 9 h and then to 6 h on day 360 and 424 respectively from day 568 the influent nitrite and ammonium concentrations were changed to 29 5 and 22 mg n l 1 respectively the new no2 n to nh4 n ratio of 1 34 was chosen based on the reaction stoichiometry observed in the previous period with the aim to achieve satisfactory effluent quality with a tn concentration below 5 mg n l 1 when the steady state of continuous phase iv was reached the hrt was further decreased to 4 h to test the ability of the established mbfr to cope with an even higher nitrogen loading rate during the entire course of the experiment liquid samples were then taken from the overflow bottle regularly once a day to monitor the nh4 no2 and no3 concentrations in the mbfr on day 595 biofilm samples were collected to elucidate the microbial community 2 3 batch tests following the long term operation described above the reactor hrt was returned to 9 h the preferred hrt based on the long term results two series of batch tests were performed when a new steady state was reached batch tests set a was undertaken to investigate the impact of influent nitrite to ammonium ratio nine runs with different influent nitrite to ammonium ratios i e 1 06 1 12 1 17 1 22 1 28 1 34 1 39 1 44 and 1 55 were carried out consecutively each lasting for 2 days in all these tests the influent tn concentration was kept constant at 51 5 mg n l 1 liquid samples were taken every 12 h from the overflow bottle to determine the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n batch tests set b was conducted to identify the nitrogen turnover rate of each organism and verify the overall mass balance the reactor was disconnected from the gas cylinder to stop the methane supply one day before the test leading to methane depletion freshly prepared medium containing 100 mg nh4 n l 1 was sparged with nitrogen for 20 min to remove oxygen and then flushed with methane for another 15 min to produce a dissolved methane concentration of approximate 20 mg ch4 l 1 this specifically prepared feed of 10 l was then pumped into the mbfr to replenish the reactor liquid a nitrite stock solution 32 g no2 n l 1 was subsequently dosed into the reactor via the overflow bottle to produce a theoretical nitrite concentration about 25 mg no2 n l 1 liquid samples were then taken from the overflow bottle every hour for about 6 h to measure the variations of nh4 no2 and no3 gas samples were also taken from the headspace of the overflow bottle hourly for the analysis of methane partial pressure in the gas phase the concentration of dissolved methane was calculated from the gas phase data using henry s law when nitrite was removed completely the ammonium and nitrite stock solutions was dosed again to repeat the experiment for two more times 2 4 chemical analytical methods liquid samples were taken from the overflow bottle with 1 5 ml syringes and filtered immediately through 0 22 μm disposable sterile millipore filters merck the concentrations of no2 n no3 n and nh4 n were assayed with a lachat quickchem8000 flow injection analyzer lachat instrument milwaukee wi for the gas measurements 0 1 ml gas samples were taken from the headspace of the overflow bottle to measure the concentration of methane through a gas chromatograph agilent gc7890a using argon as the carrier gas the biological nitrogen conversion rates facilitated by the anammox and damo reactions reactions 1 3 were determined from the measured ammonium nitrite and nitrate consumption rates supplementary information si 2 5 microbial analysis dna was extracted using fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals santa ana ca usa according to the manufacturer s instructions the 16s rrna gene amplification sequencing and analysis were undertaken following the procedures described in hülsen et al 2016 fish was also conducted following the protocols described in ettwig et al 2008 more details of the methods are described in si 3 results 3 1 long term nitrogen removal performance the mbfr was established and operated for 730 days involving two phases i e the start up phase and the continuous phase the long term nitrogen removal performance is illustrated in fig 2 upon inoculation sodium nitrite and ammonium chloride stock solutions were pulse dosed into the reactor to cultivate the biofilm 0 202 days both the ammonium and nitrite removal rates progressively increased reaching around 50 mg n l 1 d 1 at the end of the start up phase the tn removal rate was relatively stable at about 100 mg n l 1 d 1 from day 123 202 fig 2a based on the nitrogen removal rate on day 202 an initial hrt of 12 h was selected for the continuous phase that started on day 203 during continuous phase i day 203 359 the average nitrite concentration in effluent was 0 3 mg n l 1 while the ammonium concentration varied in the range of 4 5 7 8 mg n l 1 fig 2b the nitrate concentration decreased stepwise from 7 5 to below 2 5 mg n l 1 indicating the enhanced activities of damo archaea on day 359 the nitrite and ammonium removal rates were 41 0 and 52 0 mg n l 1 d 1 respectively giving rise to a tn removal rate of 88 1 mg n l 1 d 1 fig 2a to further increase the nitrogen loading rate the hrt was decreased from 12 h to 9 h and then to 6 h following the increases of nitrogen loading rate the effluent nitrite concentration increased to 0 6 0 9 mg n l 1 temporarily but declined to 0 mg n l 1 after two month adaption in both phase ii and iii fig 2b meanwhile the effluent nitrate concentration further dropped to 0 6 mg n l 1 on day 421 at hrt of 9 h and maintained relatively stable at approximately 2 5 mg n l 1 at hrt of 6 h unlike nitrite and nitrate the effluent ammonium concentration was always above 5 mg n l 1 in phase i iii fig 2b the low eluent nitrite concentration 1 0 mg n l 1 indicated that nitrite was a limiting substrate for the anammox reaction and was likely responsible for the incomplete ammonium removal therefore the influent nitrite to ammonium ratio was increased from 1 06 to 1 34 on day 568 to improve ammonium removal while the influent tn concentration remained at 51 5 mg n l 1 the effluent ammonium quickly dropped from 5 5 mg n l 1 on day 587 to 0 3 mg n l 1 on day 569 and then to 0 mg n l 1 on day 602 fig 2b at this point nitrate became the only nitrogenous species in effluent which peaked at 3 6 mg n l 1 and then gradually decreased to 2 6 mg n l 1 on day 630 giving rise to a tn removal efficiency of 94 the nitrite and ammonium removal rates in the steady state of this phase were 116 0 and 87 8 mg n l 1 d 1 respectively on day 640 the hrt was further decreased to 4 h the nitrate concentration in effluent increased to 5 2 mg n l 1 on day 647 but then gradually decreased and fluctuated around 4 mg n l 1 for the rest of experiment both the ammonium and nitrite concentrations in effluent remained stable at levels around 0 5 and 0 3 mg n l 1 respectively fig 2b with the stepwise decrease of hrt from 12 to 4 h the tn removal rate increased from 0 09 to 0 28 kg n m 3 d 1 fig 2a 3 2 impact of short term variation of influent nitrite to ammonium ratio after the long term operation the impact of influent nitrite to ammonium ratio on the nitrogen removal performance was investigated at hrt of 9 h a high level tn removal efficiency at 91 7 94 7 was obtained when the nitrite to ammonium ratio varied in the range of 1 17 1 55 table 2 indicating the established mbfr was robust to the ratio variation in this range interestingly though the nitrite removal efficiency declined to 97 8 when the nitrite to ammonium ratio was increased to 1 55 the tn removal efficiency still remained above 94 in comparison when the ratio was decreased to 1 06 ammonium accumulation was observed and the ammonium conversion efficiency dropped to 81 7 leading to a significant deterioration of the overall nitrogen removal performance these results are consistent with the long term data of continuous phase indicating that the system is more robust towards higher nitrite concentration than higher ammonium concentration 3 3 nitrogen conversion by key reactions after the long term operation batch tests set b was undertaken at hrt of 9 h to determine the rates of the key reactions reactions 1 3 based on mass balance the concentrations of ammonium and nitrite decreased simultaneously upon each addition of nitrite whilst nitrate accumulated initially but decreased when nitrite was fully consumed fig s1 concomitant to the variations of nitrogen species methane was consumed during the batch test fig s1 the measured methane consumption rate was statistically identical to that predicted by reactions 1 3 table s1 which strongly suggested that reactions 1 3 were the key reactions in the mbfr and that the contributions of heterotrophic denitrifiers were negligible supported by the mass balance results above the contributions by each of the three key reactions were calculated si and presented in fig 3 the anammox reaction was responsible for most 90 of the nitrite removed while damo bacteria contributed to less than 10 fig 3a specifically the nitrite removal rate of damo bacteria remained below 5 mg n l 1 d 1 in continuous phase i and then increased stepwise to around 17 5 mg n l 1 d 1 on day 441 in phase ii as the experiment continued the nitrite removal rate by damo bacteria dropped quickly to below 5 mg n l 1 d 1 on day 567 and remained low in the remaining phase iii in contrast the activity of anammox bacteria increased stepwise with nitrite removal rate elevated from 50 2 to 173 7 mg n l 1 d 1 progressively from phase i to phase v when the influent nitrite to ammonium ratio was increased from 1 06 to 1 34 in phase iv and v anammox bacteria contributed to more than 97 of the total nitrite removal while damo bacteria activity remained below 3 mg n l 1 d 1 notwithstanding its significant role in alleviating the impact of influent nitrite to ammonium ratio variations the nitrate production rate of anammox bacteria and the nitrate removal rate of damo archaea are shown in fig 3b while the nitrate production rate kept pace with the enhanced anammox activity the nitrate removal rate increased gradually from negligible levels at the beginning of the continuous phase to 10 2 mg n l 1 d 1 on day 422 and remained at this level for the remaining period despite of some short term variations caused by the changes in feed 3 4 microbial community characterization fish and 16s rrna gene sequencing were undertaken to investigate the functional microbial community in the mbfr biofilm the fish images confirmed the presences of anammox bacteria red damo bacteria blue and damo archaea green fig 4 a pyrosequencing analyses revealed that at phylum level the dominant microbes on day 595 were planctomycetes nc10 proteobacteria chloroflexi chlorobi od1 euryarchaeota armatimonadetes with relative abundance of 25 18 16 14 9 4 3 and 3 respectively fig 4b both types of the currently known damo organisms i e damo bacteria and damo archaea were found in the biofilm all the sequences detected in the nc10 phylum fell within the family of methylomirabiliaceae with 18 relative abundance which is well recognized as the nitrite dependent anaerobic methane oxidation bacteria ettwig et al 2010 the archaea 3 identified in the mbfr were affiliated to the methanoperedenaceae family with known ability to couple nitrate reduction with anaerobic methane oxidation haroon et al 2013 further the brocadiae belonging to the planctomycetes phylum with relative abundance of 3 has previously been confirmed to be able to carry out the anammox reaction jetten et al 2009 at the class level phycisphaerae with the highest abundance of 22 has previously been detected in other damo hu et al 2015 xie et al 2017 and anammox cultures liu et al 2017 however their roles in all these systems remain to be elucidated similarly both the anaerolineae 14 and ignavibacteria 9 classes have been found in previous anammox gilbert et al 2014 li et al 2016 and damo hu et al 2015 lu et al 2016 systems the anaerolineae class within chloroflexi phylum has been verified to be able to utilize organic carbon derived from cell lysis cao et al 2016 kindaichi et al 2012 and has also been shown to play roles in the granulation process gao et al 2011 chlorobi phylum dominated by the class of ignavibacteria has been indicated as polysaccharides scavenger in a full scale anammox reactor gonzalez gil et al 2015 the betaproteobacteria 15 and gammaproteobacteria 1 classes belonging to the proteobacteria phylum have recently been hypothesized to be able to compete for nitrite with anammox and couple nitrate reduction with the oxidation of anammox bacteria metabolites gonzalez gil et al 2015 both the aby1 class 4 affiliated to the od1 phylum and the fimbriimonadia class 3 related to the armatimonadetes phylum were observed in a full scale anammox reactor previously speth et al 2016 the aby1 class has been assumed to be able to cope with the nitrite fluctuation due to the presence of nitrite reductase nirk in the genome speth et al 2016 4 discussion a novel mbfr based technology is demonstrated in this study to achieve high level nitrogen removal under mainstream conditions through coupling anammox with damo processes although the concept of integrating anammox and damo organisms in an mbfr has been proposed in previous studies cai et al 2015 shi et al 2013 xie et al 2017 this is the first study to investigate and demonstrate the feasibility of achieving high level nitrogen removal from domestic strength wastewater through the use of such an mbfr a relatively high nitrogen removal rate of 0 2 kg n m 3 d 1 was achieved with satisfactory effluent quality tn concentration below 5 mg n l 1 it appears that an hrt of 6 9 h is suitable for such a system as summarized in table 3 the tn removal rate previously reported for the mainstream anammox process varied in a broad range of 0 02 0 55 kg n m 3 d 1 at 20 c de clippeleir et al 2013 gilbert et al 2014 han et al 2016 hendrickx et al 2012 li et al 2016 lotti et al 2014b the nitrogen removal rates achieved in the present study 0 2 0 3 kg n m 3 d 1 are comparable to these rates and are suitable for practical applications however the effluent quality achieved in most previous mainstream anammox studies was relatively poor with tn concentration of 6 20 mg n l 1 table 3 a key reason for the high effluent tn concentration was the nitrate accumulation this issue was addressed in this study by the inclusion of damo processes enabled by the provision of methane from permeable hollow fibers in the present study the average effluent tn concentration was 3 1 and 5 2 mg n l 1 at hrt of 6 h and 4 h respectively these levels are acceptable in most regions based on the standards applied directive 1991 epa 2002 voudouris and voutsa 2012 the removal of nitrate produced from anammox reaction by the damo archaea was the major reason for the much reduced effluent tn level table 3 at an hrt of 6 9 h 50 60 of the nitrate produced from the anammox reaction was reduced to nitrite by damo archaea which was further reduced to dinitrogen gas jointly by anammox and damo bacteria however when the hrt was reduced to 4 h the nitrate removal efficiency dropped to approximately 30 it appears that the ability of damo archaea to reduce nitrate could potentially be a key factor determining the hrt applicable another critical reason for the relatively high effluent tn for an anammox system is that a strict nitrite to ammonium molar ratio of 1 32 1 is required for the complete removal of both substrates when such a ratio is not satisfied one of the two substrates would remain in the effluent this requirement is relaxed in the mbfr proposed which couples the anammox and damo processes this study demonstrated that nearly complete removal 96 of both ammonium and nitrite could be achieved when the nitrite to ammonium ratio varied in the range of 1 22 1 55 table 2 this is because of the presence of damo bacteria which are able to remove the additional amount of nitrite when it is in excess this is a highly useful feature as the partial nitritation step will unlikely be able to deliver an effluent with a strictly constant nitrite to ammonium ratio of 1 32 as shown in fig 3 the contributions of the anammox and damo bacteria to the nitrite removal were 90 and 10 respectively during normal operation the relatively high abundance of methylomirabiliaceae 18 apparently did not result in a high damo bacterial activity the abundance of a microorganism is only one contributing factor to the microbial activity which is also influenced by the maximal growth rate and substrate affinities of the organism on the other hand the abundance of a microorganism is affected by not only its growth but also its decay rate unfortunately there is currently not enough information available to link the activity of damo organisms to their abundance this also means that the mbfr delivered operational flexibility with a relatively low consumption of methane for nitrite reduction analogous to the achievements in the present study another methane based mbfr also obtained high level nitrogen removal from anaerobic sludge digestion liquor previously xie et al 2017 it appears that the mbfr coupling anammox and damo reactions is a suitable bio reactor structure to achieve excellent effluent quality under both mainstream and sidestream conditions both reactors demonstrated robust performance when the influent nitrite to ammonium ratio varied the influent nitrogen concentration in the simulated mainstream wastewater used in this study had a total nitrogen concentration of 51 5 mg n l 1 approximately 5 that applied to the sidestream mbfr however the mainstream mbfr was able to achieve a nitrogen removal rate of 275 mg n l 1 d 1 i e 27 5 of that achieved with the sidestream mbfr through the use of a much shorter hrt 4 vs 24 h this indicates that the mbfr can work with a wide range of hrt a major common challenge for both reactors is the relatively long start up time resulting from the limited inoculum and the long doubling time of damo cultures raghoebarsing et al 2006 further research is needed to develop strategies to enable quicker start up 5 conclusions in this study a lab scale mbfr integrating the anammox and damo reactions was developed to remove nitrogen from mainstream partially nitrified wastewater the major conclusions and outcomes are the membrane biofilm reactor is a suitable configuration to couple anammox and damo microorganisms for mainstream wastewater treatment a high nitrogen removal rate 0 2 kg n m 3 d 1 was obtained along with satisfactory effluent quality below 5 mg tn l 1 under mainstream conditions the removal of nitrate produced from anammox reaction by damo archaea contributed significantly to the improvement in effluent quality compared to other mainstream anammox processes using granular sludge or mbbr biofilms the mbfr was robust against the variations in influent nitrite to ammonium ratio a high level nitrogen removal was achieved when the ratio varied in the range of 1 17 1 55 acknowledgements we thank dr beatrice

19783,bisphenol s bps as a main alternative of bisphenol a for the production of industrial and consumer products is now frequently detected in aquatic environments in this work it was found that free chlorine could effectively degrade bps over a wide ph range from 5 to 10 with apparent second order rate constants of 7 6 435 3 m 1s 1 a total of eleven products including chlorinated bps i e mono di tri tetrachloro bps 4 hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid bsa chlorinated bsa mono dichloro bsa 4 chlorophenol 4cp and two polymeric products were detected by high performance liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization tandem quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry two parallel transformation pathways were tentatively proposed i bps was attacked by stepwise chlorine electrophilic substitution with the formation of chlorinated bps ii bps was oxidized by chlorine via electron transfer leading to the formation of bsa 4cp and polymeric products humic acid ha significantly suppressed the degradation rates of bps even taking chlorine consumption into account while negligibly affected the products species the inhibitory effect of ha was reasonably explained by a two channel kinetic model it was proposed that ha negligibly influenced pathway i while appreciably inhibited the degradation of bps through pathway ii where ha reversed bps phenoxyl radical formed via pathway ii back to parent bps keywords bisphenol s chlorine humic acid electrophilic substitution electron transfer 1 introduction due to the widespread occurrence of bisphenol a bpa and its adverse effect on both human and ecosystem health organizations such as the united states environmental protection agency usepa and the european food safety authority efsa established a limit to bpa barroso 2011 staples et al 1998 vandenberg et al 2007 in response to these restrictions and public pressure bisphenol s bps 4 4 sulfonyldiphenol is gradually used in replacement of bpa bps is commonly used in epoxy glues canned coatings foodstuffs and paper products naderi et al 2014 therefore the occurrence of bps in the aquatic environments has been documented in recent years liao et al 2012 van leerdam et al 2014 yamazaki et al 2015 yang et al 2014 for instance yamazaki et al 2015 reported the occurrence of bps as high as 6840 ng l in surface water and seawater of japan china korea and india liao et al 2012 reported that bps was present in the sediment of united states japan and korea up to the concentration of 1970 ng g dry weight unfortunately several studies have reported that bps has similar estrogenic activity and appears to be more resistant to environmental degradation as compared to bpa danzl et al 2009 hashimoto et al 2001 rochester and bolden 2015 chlorine is a globally most used chemical for water disinfection in addition it has been well documented that chlorine can react with a wide range of organic contaminants especially phenolic compounds deborde et al 2004 deborde and von gunten 2008 dodd et al 2005 dodd and huang 2007 gallard and von gunten 2002a b gallard et al 2004 gao et al 2016 rebenne et al 1996 for instance gallard et al 2004 reported that bpa could be appreciably degraded by chlorine with a second order rate constant of 58 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 0 at 20 c where chlorinated bpa was generated via stepwise electrophilic substitution in a very recent work we found that chlorine could rapidly oxidize tetrabromobisphenol a tbrbpa via electron transfer with a second order rate constant of 1360 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 0 at 25 c where oxidative product 2 6 dibromo 4 hydroxycumyl alcohol was predominantly generated gao et al 2016 lin et al 2009 however the reactions of chlorine with bps structurally similar to bpa and tbrbpa see table s1 for their chemical structures have not been characterized so far dissolved organic matter dom ubiquitously existing in diverse aquatic environments may exert important impacts on the transformation of contaminants in natural environments and engineered processes as a competitor for oxidant dom can suppress the degradation of contaminants in numerous chemical oxidation processes fang et al 2014 gallard et al 2004 li et al 2017 lu et al 2015 luo et al 2016 sharma et al 2015 another inhibitory effect of dom has been reported to take place in excited triplet states permanganate ferrate or enzymatic catalysis

one electron transfer back to parent contaminants interestingly in our recent work this inhibitory effect of dom was also observed in chlorination of tbrbpa while not in chlorination of bpa gao et al 2016 the contrasting effects might be related to the distinct pathways involved in chlorination of bpa vs tbrbpa i e electrophilic substitution for bpa vs electron transfer for tbrbpa gao et al 2016 in this work the transformation kinetics and products of bps by chlorine as well as the effect of ha were investigated for the first time firstly reaction kinetics were studied in synthetic buffered

exhibited a strong ph dependency in other word k app substantially increased from 7 6 0 2 to 435 3 13 1 m 1s 1 with ph increasing from 5 to 8 and then decreased to 11 9 0 4 m 1s 1 as ph further increased to 10 si table s2 similar bell shaped ph rate profiles were also observed in previous studies on the reactions of chlorine and phenolics e g phenol bpa tbrbpa triclosan and 4 n nonylphenol which were reasonably explained by the combined effects of chlorine speciation and phenolic speciation as a function of ph deborde et al 2004 deborde and von gunten 2008 gallard and von gunten 2002a b gallard et al 2004 lee and von gunten 2012 mackie et al 2017 rebenne et al 1996 the dissociation of phenolics pk a1 bps 7 42 pk a2 bps 8 03 eqs 1 and 2 can result in the increase of k app as the dissociating forms exhibit stronger reactivity towards chlorine choi and lee 2017 the dissociation of hocl to ocl pk a hocl 7 54 eq 3 can lead to the decrease of k app due to the much lower reactivity of ocl as compared to hocl i e the contribution of ocl was considered to be negligible 1 bps k a 1 bps h 2 bps k a 2 bps 2 h 3 hocl k a cl h ocl recently lau et al 2016 reported that cl2 and clo2 might take participate in chlorination of phenolics e g phenol and 2 4 dichloropheonol in acid solutions ph 6 containing high concentrations of chloride 1 mm in addition the involvement of cl2 and clo2 species could result in the reaction order with respect to hocl approaching to 2 considering the relatively low chloride concentration introduced by chlorine stock solution into reaction solutions it seemed likely that cl2 and clo2 negligibly contributed to the overall reaction moreover the first reaction order relative to hocl in chlorination of bps si figure s1b further precluded the involvement of cl2 and clo2 species therefore the following reactions eqs 4 6 were initially proposed to explain the ph rate profile in chlorination of bps 4 bps hocl k 1 product 5 bps hocl k 2 product 6 bps 2 hocl k 3 product the apparent second order rate constant could be expressed as follows 7 k a p p k 1 h 3 k 2 k a 1 h 2 k 3 h k a 1 k a 2 h 3 k a 1 k a c l h 2 k a 1 k a c l k a 1 k a 2 h k a 1 k a 2 k a c l the species specific second order rate constants were calculated according to nonlinear least squares regressions the fit between experimental data and eq 7 was satisfactory fig 1 further validating the assumption that hocl was the primary oxidant the values of k 1 k 2 and k 3 were calculated to be 25 8 m 1 s 1 1 5 0 6 102 m 1 s 1 and 4 0 0 14 103 m 1 s 1 respectively a similar difference in species specific second order rate constants i e k 3 k 2 k 1 was also observed in chlorination of bpa gallard et al 2004 these findings could be attributed to the much higher activating effect of hydroxyl groups after their deprotonation i e the dissociated forms exhibited higher reactivity towards hocl deborde et al 2004 gallard et al 2004 gao et al 2016 3 2 quantitative structure activity relationship in previous work lee and von gunten 2012 established a quantitative structure activity relationship qsar for the species specific rate constants of hocl and phenolate ions e g dissociated forms of chlorophenols bromophenols triclosan and 4 n nonylphenol where σ o m p was the best substituent descriptor variable among hammett σ constants i e σ σ and σ eq 8 8 log k hocl 4 46 0 15 4 90 0 44 σ o m p the phenolics used to obtain the qsar eq 8 almost all undergo chlorine electrophilic substitution as demonstrated in many studies on chlorinated products of these phenolic compounds deborde and von gunten 2008 hu et al 2002 lee and morris 1962 rule et al 2005 due to the complex structure of bps the hammett constants for bps substituents were unavailable in literature so a structural approximation was used to estimate the hammett substituent constants si table s1 this is based on the principle that the inductive resonance effects of atoms in substituents are weakened with increasing distance of the atoms from a reaction center in previous work this structural approximation has been well applied to estimate the hammett σ constants for structurally complex compounds e g bpa and 17a ethinylestradiol and their rate constants could be predicted from the developed qsars by using the estimated hammett constants lee and von gunten 2012 in the case of bpa the substituent of 4 c ch3 2 c6h4oh was approximated to be 4 c ch3 2 ch3 and thus the structure of bpa was approximated to be 4 isopropylphenol lee and von gunten 2012 similar to the case of bpa the structure of bps was approximated to be 4 methylsulfonyl phenol si table s1 accordingly the species specific rate constants of fully dissociated bpa and bps could be predicted by eq 8 from their hammett σ constants 0 13 for bpa and 1 13 for bps lee and von gunten 2012 lee and von gunten 2012 reported that the species specific rate constant of fully dissociated bpa could be also well predicted by the qsar eq 8 this was consistent with two independent studies where bpa was transformed by chlorine via electrophilic substitution pathway as confirmed by the formation of chlorinated bpa gallard et al 2004 hu et al 2002 however according to eq 8 the value of k 3 for bps was predicted to be in the range of 0 019 0 37 m 1 s 1 at least four orders of magnitude lower than the experimental one 4 0 0 14 103 m 1 s 1 a similar result was also obtained in a recent study on chlorination of tbrbpa and the underestimation was explained by that tbrbpa was transformed by chlorine via electron transfer rather than electrophilic substitution as confirmed by product analysis gao et al 2016 so it seemed likely that oxidative pathway might be also involved in chlorination of bps leading to the underestimation of k 3 by the qsar eq 8 possibly due to the withdrawing effect of sulfur in bps structure see the following section 3 3 identification of transformation products fig 2 showed the hplc esi qtof ms chromatogram of a sample containing bps treated by chlorine at ph 7 as can be seen six new peaks appeared as compared to the control one product i eluting at 19 31 min had a molecular ion of 282 983 on the basis of its accurate mass and isotopic pattern si figure s2 the molecular formula of product i was assigned as c12h8so4cl i e c12h9so4cl h it was further proposed to be mono chloro bps in accordance with its major fragments ions of 18 h2o 36 hcl 126 c6h3clo and 157 c6h5so3 si figure s3 products ii and iii eluting at 20 46 and 20 71 min had the same molecular ion of 316 944 indicating they were structural isomers their molecular ions displayed isotopic patterns identical to the molecular formula of c12h7so4cl2 i e c12h8so4cl2 h si figure s4 the fragment ions of product ii in the product ion spectra apparently included m z 36 hcl 157 c6h5so3 160 c6h2cl2o si figure s5 so product ii was supposed to be 2 6 dichloro bps product iii was suggested to be 2 6 dichloro bps in accordance with its fragment ions of 36 hcl 126 c6h3clo and 191 c6h4so3cl si figure s6 product iv at 21 12 min had a molecular ion of 126 996 corresponding to molecular formula of c6h4ocl i e c6h5ocl h si figure s7 it was further assigned to be 4 chlorophenol 4cp according to its fragment ions of 36 hcl and 91 c6h3o which was confirmed by its analytical standard si figure s8 product v at 21 80 min had a molecular ion of 350 905 corresponding to molecular formula of c12h6so4cl3 i e c12h7so4cl3 h si figure s9 it was further supposed to be trichloro bps on the basis of fragment ions of 36 hcl 126 c6h3clo 160 c6h2cl2o and 191 c6h4so3cl si figure s10 product vi eluting at 23 05 min had a molecular ion of 384 866 exhibiting isotopic patterns identical to the molecular formula of c12h5so4cl4 i e c12h6so4cl4 h si figure s11 it was further assigned to be tetrachloro bps in accordance with its fragment ions of 36 hcl 160 c6h2cl2o and 225 c6h2so3cl si figure s12 it should be noted that not all transformation products could be detected as chromatographic peak by visual inspection against the baseline of the chromatogram because of their different abundances and response values baena nogueras et al 2017 gulde et al 2016 therefore the analytics software ab sciex was further applied to pick up possible products through suspect analysis on the basis of accurate mass measurement specific fragments as well as comparison of theoretical and measured isotopic patterns as a consequence additional five products vii xi were identified products vii and viii were isomeric dimers of bps product ix was assigned to be 4 hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid bsa which was further confirmed by its analytical standards products x and xi were proposed to be mono and dichloro bsa respectively in order to confirm this transformation products of bsa treated by chlorine were detected and the chromatogram was shown in si figure s13 where products x and xi were obvious in summary a total of eleven products were identified in chlorination of bps and their detailed information including retention time accurate mass molecular formula and proposed molecular structure were shown in table 1 3 4 proposed reaction pathways on the basis of identified products transformation pathways for chlorination of bps were tentatively proposed as shown in fig 3 bps was initially attacked by chlorine substitution with the formation of monochloro bps product i which subsequently underwent stepwise substitution reactions leading to the generation of di tri tetrachloro bps products ii iii v and vi similar chlorine electrophilic substitution was also reported in chlorination of bpa gallard et al 2004 this transformation pathway pathway i is consistent with the fact that electrophilic substitution is a main chlorination pathway for aromatic rings deborde and von gunten 2008 gallard et al 2004 lee and morris 1962 in addition an oxidative pathway pathway ii was proposed to account for the formation of 4cp product vi dimers prdocuts vii and viii and bsa product ix the phenol moiety of bps was initially oxidized by chlorine with the formation of a phenoxy radical r1 then radical r1 coupled to each other with the formation of dimers products vii and viii or cleavaged to release r2 radical and r3 cation subsequently r2 radical was further transformed to 4cp product iv r3 intermediate underwent substitution reactions to generate bsa product ix which might be further attacked by chlorine substitution with the generation of chlorinated bsa product x and xi similar transformation pathway ii was also reported in tbrbpa oxidation by chlorine gao et al 2016 kuruto niwa et al 2005 reported that chlorinated bps i e mono di tri tetrachloro bps showed a substantially lower estrogenic activity compared to bps using a green fluorescent protein expression system in contrast to the findings that chlorinated bpa exhibited higher estrogenic activity compared to parent bpa in addition the estrogenic activity of 4 cp was found to be very low as reported by nishihara et al 2000 by testing the estrogenic activity of more than 500 chemicals nishihara et al 2000 concluded that the estrogen activity of substituent phenolics was positively related to their hydrophobic moiety at the para position so several oxidative products of bps by chlorine e g bsa and its chlorinated derivatives are expected to show an appreciably low estrogenic activity due to hydrophilicity of sulfonic group therefore it seems likely that chlorine treatment may also eliminate estrogenic activity induced by bps which warrants further verification by laboratory tests 3 5 effect of ha on chlorination of bps 3 5 1 effect of ha on reaction kinetics kinetic experiments were conducted to assess the effect of ha 0 5 2 mgc l during chlorination 30 μm of bps 1 μm at an environmentally relevant ph 7 fig 4 exhibited the time course profiles of bps degradation and chlorine loss respectively as can be seen the presence of ha appreciably suppressed the degradation of bps with the concentration of ha increasing from 0 to 2 mg c l the extent of bps loss greatly decreased from 86 to 46 at 15 min ha could competitively consume oxidant thus leading to the decrease of degradation rates gallard et al 2004 yang et al 2014 in order to account for this effect eq 9 was introduced to quantify the kinetics 9 c t c 0 exp k 0 t hocl d t where ct was the concentration of bps at a specific time t c0 was the initial concentration of bps and 0 t hocl dt was the chlorine concentration integrated over time i e chlorine exposure it was found that the predictions made according to eq 9 considerably overestimated the level of bps loss in the presence of ha si fig 14 in addition the transformation rate constants k at different concentrations of ha could be obtained by eq 9 as shown in fig 5 the rate constants k decreased with the increase of ha concentration similar inhibition was also observed in chlorination of tbrbpa which was reasonably explained by the fact that tbrbpa phenoxyl radicals formed by one electron chlorine oxidation were competitively reduced back to its parent by ha interestingly it was also found that ha had negligible influence on the degradation of bpa by chlorine where the reaction proceeded via chlorine electrophilic substitution gao et al 2016 considering the two channel pathways involved in chlorination of bps we tentatively proposed that ha inhibited the degradation of bps by chlorine via electron transfer pathway ii similar to the case of tbrbpa in parallel ha had negligible effect on the depletion of bps transformed via electrophile substitution pathway i similar to the case of bpa a two channel kinetic model was accordingly introduced to further characterize the effect of ha contaminants p was transformed by chlorine with the formation of intermediate p1 via electron transfer with a yield r and p2 via electrophilic substitution with a yield 1 r eq 10 p1 would be competitively reduced by ha to its original form p eq 11 in addition to its further irreversibly transformation eq 12 10 p chlorine k 4 r p 1 1 r p 2 11 p 1 ha k 5 p 12 p 1 k 6 products the reactions 10 and 11 were both second order to reactants where k 4 represented the rate constants in the absence of ha eq 10 and k 5 was the rate constants for the reaction of intermediate p1 with ha eq 11 k 6 was the first order rate constant for eq 12 therefore kinetic eqs 13 and 14 could be obtained to describe the degradation rate for p and the formation rate for p1 respectively 13 d p dt k 4 p chlorine k 5 p 1 ha 14 d p 1 dt r k 4 p chlorine k 6 p 1 k 5 p 1 ha by making a steady state assumption for p1 eq 15 could be obtained 15 d p dt k 4 1 r r k 6 k 5 ha k 6 p chlorine therefore the rate constant in the presence of ha could be described as eq 16 16 k ha k 4 1 r r k 6 k 5 ha k 6 k 4 1 r r k 5 k 6 ha 1 as can be seen in fig 5 the two channel kinetic model eq 16 could fit the experimental data well the values of r and k 5 k 6 was estimated to 0 64 0 02 and 1 66 0 18 respectively these results indicated that the contribution of electron transfer and electrophilic substitution pathway to bps degradation was around 64 and 36 respectively 3 5 2 effect of ha on products formation i products analysis the effect of ha on the products formation during chlorination of bps was also investigated no additional products were detected in the presence of ha compared to the case in the absence of ha data not shown this finding was similar to the scenario of chlorination of tbrbpa where ha had negligible impact on the products species either gao et al 2016 the influence of ha on products formation during oxidation processes e g permanganate ferrate and enzymatic catalysis was also investigated in previous work but confounding effects were reported gao et al 2016 li et al 2017 lu et al 2015 2017 lu and huang 2009 lu et al 2017 for instance li et al 2017 reported that ha negligibly influenced the products species in soybean catalyzed oxidation of triclosan on the contrary feng et al 2013 reported that ha affected the products species in laccase catalyzed oxidation of tbrbpa where additional new products with large molecular ions were detected in the presence of ha it seemed likely that the effect of ha on the products species was complex which might be associated with the nature of ha and the experimental conditions due to the complexity of ha molecular structure model compounds with defined structures were used to further explore the effect of ha in previous work 2 methoxyphenol was commonly used to mimic ha li et al 2017 lu and huang 2009 lu et al 2017 for instance lu and huang 2009 reported that the presence of 2 methoxyphenol in laccase catalysis oxidation of acetaminophen led to the formation of a new product resulting from the coupling of 2 methoxyphenol and acetamionphenol phenoxy radicals similarly cross coupling products were also detected in soybean peroxidase catalysis oxidation of triclosan in this work a new product with a molecular ion of 371 059 was detected when 2 methoxyphenol was present during chlorination of bps this new product was likely generated from cross coupling of bps and 2 methoxyphenol phenoxy radicals si fig 15 this finding in turn confirmed the occurrence of oxidative pathway during chlorination of bps interestingly several studies reported that co solvent methanol could affect the product species during bpa or tbrbpa oxidation e g by permanganate ferrate manganese dioxide or enzymatic catalysis oxidation which was also verified in this work si table s3 feng et al 2013 gao et al 2016 yang et al 2014 carbocation intermediates of 4 isopropylphenol or 2 6 dibromo 4 isopropylphenol formed during bpa or tbrbpa oxidation underwent substitution reactions with methanol other than water to generate 4 hydroxy isopropyl methanol or 2 6 dibromo hydroxy isopropyl methanol si table s3 similarly a new product with a molecular ion of 187 007 was detected in chlorination of bps when methanol was present this new product was suggested to be 4 hydroxy methyl benzenesulfonate si fig 16 which was derived from the substitution reaction of methanol and r3 intermediate this finding confirmed again the occurrence of oxidative pathway during chlorination of bps ii products evolution the time course profiles of transformation products of bps by chlorine in the absence vs presence of ha were comparatively monitored by the hplc esi qqq ms at mrm mode fig 6 in the absence of ha the consecutive formation of chlorinated bps generated through chlorine electrophilic substitution pathway was followed by their decay as a function of time where mono di tri tetrachloro bps reached their maxima at about 5 8 15 and 35 min respectively as the reaction proceeded tetrachloro bps became the only chlorinated bps congeners 4cp generated via electron transfer pathway was gradually accumulated within 15 min and then declined the maximum yield of 4cp was quantified by the authentic standard to be about 2 with respect to bps loss unfortunately the response values of bsa and polymeric products also generated via electron transfer pathway were too low and thus the formation dynamics of bsa and its chlorinated products as well as the two dimers were not followed in the presence of ha the formation of monochloro bps was also followed by its decay along with the reaction time but the occurrence of its maxima was prolonged to about 25 min dichloro bps and trichloro bps were gradually generated and then reached plateaus while tetrachloro bps was negligibly generated in particular the maximum yield of monochloro bps was calculated to be 0 53 by using peak areas i e dividing its peak area by the decreased peak area of bps due to the lack of authentic standard which was higher than that obtained in the absence of ha 0 40 along with reaction time 4cp slowly accumulated to a plateau and its maximum yield was calculated to be about 1 1 lower than that obtained in the absence of ha 2 these findings that ha increased the yield of monochloro bps and decreased the yield of 4cp were in consistent with the conclusion deduced from the two channel model where bps was transformed by two parallel pathways and ha could inhibit the degradation of bps via electron transfer pathway 4 conclusion this work firstly investigated the transformation of bps by chlorine including kinetics products mechanism and the effect of ha the following conclusions were obtained which might improve the understanding of chlorine chemistry in water treatment chlorine could effectively degrade bps over a wide ph range from 5 to 10 with the apparent second order rate constants of 7 6 435 3 m 1s 1 with a typical chlorine residual concentration of 2 mg l the half life time of bps was calculated to be around 0 94 3 2 min at ph 7 8 eleven products including chlorinated bps i e mono di tri tetrachloro bps 4cp bsa chlorinated bsa i e mono dichloro bsa and two dimers were detected by hplc esi qtof ms it was proposed that bps was transformed by chorine via two parallel pathways including chlorine electrophile substitution and electron transfer pathways the inhibitory effect of ha on bps degradation was reasonably explained by a two channel kinetic model where ha negligibly influenced electrophile substitution while appreciably inhibited the degradation of bps through electron transfer via reversing bps phenoxyl radical back to parent bps ha had negligible impact on the product species in chlorination of bps however in the presence of 2 methoxyphenol a new additional product was generated via cross coupling of bps and 2 methoxyphenol phenoxy radicals in the case of co solvent methanol 4 hydroxy methyl benzenesulfonate derived from the substitution reaction of methanol and an intermediate was generated acknowledgments this work was supported by the national

19783,bisphenol s bps as a main alternative of bisphenol a for the production of industrial and consumer products is now frequently detected in aquatic environments in this work it was found that free chlorine could effectively degrade bps over a wide ph range from 5 to 10 with apparent second order rate constants of 7 6 435 3 m 1s 1 a total of eleven products including chlorinated bps i e mono di tri tetrachloro bps 4 hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid bsa chlorinated bsa mono dichloro bsa 4 chlorophenol 4cp and two polymeric products were detected by high performance liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization tandem quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry two parallel transformation pathways were tentatively proposed i bps was attacked by stepwise chlorine electrophilic substitution with the formation of chlorinated bps ii bps was oxidized by chlorine via electron transfer leading to the formation of bsa 4cp and polymeric products humic acid ha significantly suppressed the degradation rates of bps even taking chlorine consumption into account while negligibly affected the products species the inhibitory effect of ha was reasonably explained by a two channel kinetic model it was proposed that ha negligibly influenced pathway i while appreciably inhibited the degradation of bps through pathway ii where ha reversed bps phenoxyl radical formed via pathway ii back to parent bps keywords bisphenol s chlorine humic acid electrophilic substitution electron transfer 1 introduction due to the widespread occurrence of bisphenol a bpa and its adverse effect on both human and ecosystem health organizations such as the united states environmental protection agency usepa and the european food safety authority efsa established a limit to bpa barroso 2011 staples et al 1998 vandenberg et al 2007 in response to these restrictions and public pressure bisphenol s bps 4 4 sulfonyldiphenol is gradually used in replacement of bpa bps is commonly used in epoxy glues canned coatings foodstuffs and paper products naderi et al 2014 therefore the occurrence of bps in the aquatic environments has been documented in recent years liao et al 2012 van leerdam et al 2014 yamazaki et al 2015 yang et al 2014 for instance yamazaki et al 2015 reported the occurrence of bps as high as 6840 ng l in surface water and seawater of japan china korea and india liao et al 2012 reported that bps was present in the sediment of united states japan and korea up to the concentration of 1970 ng g dry weight unfortunately several studies have reported that bps has similar estrogenic activity and appears to be more resistant to environmental degradation as compared to bpa danzl et al 2009 hashimoto et al 2001 rochester and bolden 2015 chlorine is a globally most used chemical for water disinfection in addition it has been well documented that chlorine can react with a wide range of organic contaminants especially phenolic compounds deborde et al 2004 deborde and von gunten 2008 dodd et al 2005 dodd and huang 2007 gallard and von gunten 2002a b gallard et al 2004 gao et al 2016 rebenne et al 1996 for instance gallard et al 2004 reported that bpa could be appreciably degraded by chlorine with a second order rate constant of 58 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 0 at 20 c where chlorinated bpa was generated via stepwise electrophilic substitution in a very recent work we found that chlorine could rapidly oxidize tetrabromobisphenol a tbrbpa via electron transfer with a second order rate constant of 1360 m 1 s 1 at ph 7 0 at 25 c where oxidative product 2 6 dibromo 4 hydroxycumyl alcohol was predominantly generated gao et al 2016 lin et al 2009 however the reactions of chlorine with bps structurally similar to bpa and tbrbpa see table s1 for their chemical structures have not been characterized so far dissolved organic matter dom ubiquitously existing in diverse aquatic environments may exert important impacts on the transformation of contaminants in natural environments and engineered processes as a competitor for oxidant dom can suppress the degradation of contaminants in numerous chemical oxidation processes fang et al 2014 gallard et al 2004 li et al 2017 lu et al 2015 luo et al 2016 sharma et al 2015 another inhibitory effect of dom has been reported to take place in excited triplet states permanganate ferrate or enzymatic catalysis oxidation canonica and laubscher 2008 feng et al 2013 gao et al 2016 leresche et al 2016 lu et al 2015 vione et al 2018 wenk et al 2011 2015 where dom can reduce the reactive intermediates formed via one electron transfer back to parent contaminants interestingly in our recent work this inhibitory effect of dom was also observed in chlorination of tbrbpa while not in chlorination of bpa gao et al 2016 the contrasting effects might be related to the distinct pathways involved in chlorination of bpa vs tbrbpa i e electrophilic substitution for bpa vs electron transfer for tbrbpa gao et al 2016 in this work the transformation kinetics and products of bps by chlorine as well as the effect of ha were investigated for the first time firstly reaction kinetics were studied in synthetic buffered waters over ph range of 5 10 secondly transformation products of bps by chlorine were identified by a high performance liquid chromatography and electrospray ionization tandem quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry hplc esi qtof ms and the tentative pathways were proposed finally the effects of ha on the transformation of bps by chlorine were investigated 2 experimental section 2 1

deionized water 18 2 mωcm from a milli pore system the stock solutions of chlorine were prepared by diluting a commercial solution of sodium hypochlorite naclo 4 active chlorine and standardized by iodometry the stock solutions of ha were purified by repeated ph adjustment filtration and precipitation following the procedure described in our previous work and its concentration was measured in mgc l gao et al 2016 rebhun et al 1998 2 2 experimental procedure kinetic studies were performed in 50 ml conical flasks under constant stirring at 25 2 c reactions were initiated by adding chlorine

see si figure s1a for example moreover the measured pseudo first order rate constants showed a linear correlation with varying chlorine concentrations see si figure s1b for example therefore the reactions of chlorine with bps were first order with respect to each reactant the apparent second order rate constants k app could be accordingly determined and shown in fig 1 as can be seen k app exhibited a strong ph dependency in other word k app substantially increased from 7 6 0 2 to 435 3 13 1 m 1s 1 with ph increasing from 5 to 8 and then decreased to 11 9 0 4 m 1s 1 as ph further increased to 10 si table s2 similar bell shaped ph rate profiles were also observed in previous studies on the reactions of chlorine and phenolics e g phenol bpa tbrbpa triclosan and 4 n nonylphenol which were reasonably explained by the combined effects of chlorine speciation and phenolic speciation as a function of ph deborde et al 2004 deborde and von gunten 2008 gallard and von gunten 2002a b gallard et al 2004 lee and von gunten 2012 mackie et al 2017 rebenne et al 1996 the dissociation of phenolics pk a1 bps 7 42 pk a2 bps 8 03 eqs 1 and 2 can result in the increase of k app as the dissociating forms exhibit stronger reactivity towards chlorine choi and lee 2017 the dissociation of hocl to ocl pk a hocl 7 54 eq 3 can lead to the decrease of k app due to the much lower reactivity of ocl as compared to hocl i e the contribution of ocl was considered to be negligible 1 bps k a 1 bps h 2 bps k a 2 bps 2 h 3 hocl k a cl h ocl recently lau et al 2016 reported that cl2 and clo2 might take participate in chlorination of phenolics e g phenol and 2 4 dichloropheonol in acid solutions ph 6 containing high concentrations of chloride 1 mm in addition the involvement of cl2 and clo2 species could result in the reaction order with respect to hocl approaching to 2 considering the relatively low chloride concentration introduced by chlorine stock solution into reaction solutions it seemed likely that cl2 and clo2 negligibly contributed to the overall reaction moreover the first reaction order relative to hocl in chlorination of bps si figure s1b further precluded the involvement of cl2 and clo2 species therefore the following reactions eqs 4 6 were initially proposed to explain the ph rate profile in chlorination of bps 4 bps hocl k 1 product 5 bps hocl k 2 product 6 bps 2 hocl k 3 product the apparent second order rate constant could be expressed as follows 7 k a p p k 1 h 3 k 2 k a 1 h 2 k 3 h k a 1 k a 2 h 3 k a 1 k a c l h 2 k a 1 k a c l k a 1 k a 2 h k a 1 k a 2 k a c l the species specific second order rate constants were calculated according to nonlinear least squares regressions the fit between experimental data and eq 7 was satisfactory fig 1 further validating the assumption that hocl was the primary oxidant the values of k 1 k 2 and k 3 were calculated to be 25 8 m 1 s 1 1 5 0 6 102 m 1 s 1 and 4 0 0 14 103 m 1 s 1 respectively a similar difference in species specific second order rate constants i e k 3 k 2 k 1 was also observed in chlorination of bpa gallard et al 2004 these findings could be attributed to the much higher activating effect of hydroxyl groups after their deprotonation i e the dissociated forms exhibited higher reactivity towards hocl deborde et al 2004 gallard et al 2004 gao et al 2016 3 2 quantitative structure activity relationship in previous work lee and von gunten 2012 established a quantitative structure activity relationship qsar for the species specific rate constants of hocl and phenolate ions e g dissociated forms of chlorophenols bromophenols triclosan and 4 n nonylphenol where σ o m p was the best substituent descriptor variable among hammett σ constants i e σ σ and σ eq 8 8 log k hocl 4 46 0 15 4 90 0 44 σ o m p the phenolics used to obtain the qsar eq 8 almost all undergo chlorine electrophilic substitution as demonstrated in many studies on chlorinated products of these phenolic compounds deborde and von gunten 2008 hu et al 2002 lee and morris 1962 rule et al 2005 due to the complex structure of bps the hammett constants for bps substituents were unavailable in literature so a structural approximation was used to estimate the hammett substituent constants si table s1 this is based on the principle that the inductive resonance effects of atoms in substituents are weakened with increasing distance of the atoms from a reaction center in previous work this structural approximation has been well applied to estimate the hammett σ constants for structurally complex compounds e g bpa and 17a ethinylestradiol and their rate constants could be predicted from the developed qsars by using the estimated hammett constants lee and von gunten 2012 in the case of bpa the substituent of 4 c ch3 2 c6h4oh was approximated to be 4 c ch3 2 ch3 and thus the structure of bpa was approximated to be 4 isopropylphenol lee and von gunten 2012 similar to the case of bpa the structure of bps was approximated to be 4 methylsulfonyl phenol si table s1 accordingly the species specific rate constants of fully dissociated bpa and bps could be predicted by eq 8 from their hammett σ constants 0 13 for bpa and 1 13 for bps lee and von gunten 2012 lee and von gunten 2012 reported that the species specific rate constant of fully dissociated bpa could be also well predicted by the qsar eq 8 this was consistent with two independent studies where bpa was transformed by chlorine via electrophilic substitution pathway as confirmed by the formation of chlorinated bpa gallard et al 2004 hu et al 2002 however according to eq 8 the value of k 3 for bps was predicted to be in the range of 0 019 0 37 m 1 s 1 at least four orders of magnitude lower than the experimental one 4 0 0 14 103 m 1 s 1 a similar result was also obtained in a recent study on chlorination of tbrbpa and the underestimation was explained by that tbrbpa was transformed by chlorine via electron transfer rather than electrophilic substitution as confirmed by product analysis gao et al 2016 so it seemed likely that oxidative pathway might be also involved in chlorination of bps leading to the underestimation of k 3 by the qsar eq 8 possibly due to the withdrawing effect of sulfur in bps structure see the following section 3 3 identification of transformation products fig 2 showed the hplc esi qtof ms chromatogram of a sample containing bps treated by chlorine at ph 7 as can be seen six new peaks appeared as compared to the control one product i eluting at 19 31 min had a molecular ion of 282 983 on the basis of its accurate mass and isotopic pattern si figure s2 the molecular formula of product i was assigned as c12h8so4cl i e c12h9so4cl h it was further proposed to be mono chloro bps in accordance with its major fragments ions of 18 h2o 36 hcl 126 c6h3clo and 157 c6h5so3 si figure s3 products ii and iii eluting at 20 46 and 20 71 min had the same molecular ion of 316 944 indicating they were structural isomers their molecular ions displayed isotopic patterns identical to the molecular formula of c12h7so4cl2 i e c12h8so4cl2 h si figure s4 the fragment ions of product ii in the product ion spectra apparently included m z 36 hcl 157 c6h5so3 160 c6h2cl2o si figure s5 so product ii was supposed to be 2 6 dichloro bps product iii was suggested to be 2 6 dichloro bps in accordance with its fragment ions of 36 hcl 126 c6h3clo and 191 c6h4so3cl si figure s6 product iv at 21 12 min had a molecular ion of 126 996 corresponding to molecular formula of c6h4ocl i e c6h5ocl h si figure s7 it was further assigned to be 4 chlorophenol 4cp according to its fragment ions of 36 hcl and 91 c6h3o which was confirmed by its analytical standard si figure s8 product v at 21 80 min had a molecular ion of 350 905 corresponding to molecular formula of c12h6so4cl3 i e c12h7so4cl3 h si figure s9 it was further supposed to be trichloro bps on the basis of fragment ions of 36 hcl 126 c6h3clo 160 c6h2cl2o and 191 c6h4so3cl si figure s10 product vi eluting at 23 05 min had a molecular ion of 384 866 exhibiting isotopic patterns identical to the molecular formula of c12h5so4cl4 i e c12h6so4cl4 h si figure s11 it was further assigned to be tetrachloro bps in accordance with its fragment ions of 36 hcl 160 c6h2cl2o and 225 c6h2so3cl si figure s12 it should be noted that not all transformation products could be detected as chromatographic peak by visual inspection against the baseline of the chromatogram because of their different abundances and response values baena nogueras et al 2017 gulde et al 2016 therefore the analytics software ab sciex was further applied to pick up possible products through suspect analysis on the basis of accurate mass measurement specific fragments as well as comparison of theoretical and measured isotopic patterns as a consequence additional five products vii xi were identified products vii and viii were isomeric dimers of bps product ix was assigned to be 4 hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid bsa which was further confirmed by its analytical standards products x and xi were proposed to be mono and dichloro bsa respectively in order to confirm this transformation products of bsa treated by chlorine were detected and the chromatogram was shown in si figure s13 where products x and xi were obvious in summary a total of eleven products were identified in chlorination of bps and their detailed information including retention time accurate mass molecular formula and proposed molecular structure were shown in table 1 3 4 proposed reaction pathways on the basis of identified products transformation pathways for chlorination of bps were tentatively proposed as shown in fig 3 bps was initially attacked by chlorine substitution with the formation of monochloro bps product i which subsequently underwent stepwise substitution reactions leading to the generation of di tri tetrachloro bps products ii iii v and vi similar chlorine electrophilic substitution was also reported in chlorination of bpa gallard et al 2004 this transformation pathway pathway i is consistent with the fact that electrophilic substitution is a main chlorination pathway for aromatic rings deborde and von gunten 2008 gallard et al 2004 lee and morris 1962 in addition an oxidative pathway pathway ii was proposed to account for the formation of 4cp product vi dimers prdocuts vii and viii and bsa product ix the phenol moiety of bps was initially oxidized by chlorine with the formation of a phenoxy radical r1 then radical r1 coupled to each other with the formation of dimers products vii and viii or cleavaged to release r2 radical and r3 cation subsequently r2 radical was further transformed to 4cp product iv r3 intermediate underwent substitution reactions to generate bsa product ix which might be further attacked by chlorine substitution with the generation of chlorinated bsa product x and xi similar transformation pathway ii was also reported in tbrbpa oxidation by chlorine gao et al 2016 kuruto niwa et al 2005 reported that chlorinated bps i e mono di tri tetrachloro bps showed a substantially lower estrogenic activity compared to bps using a green fluorescent protein expression system in contrast to the findings that chlorinated bpa exhibited higher estrogenic activity compared to parent bpa in addition the estrogenic activity of 4 cp was found to be very low as reported by nishihara et al 2000 by testing the estrogenic activity of more than 500 chemicals nishihara et al 2000 concluded that the estrogen activity of substituent phenolics was positively related to their hydrophobic moiety at the para position so several oxidative products of bps by chlorine e g bsa and its chlorinated derivatives are expected to show an appreciably low estrogenic activity due to hydrophilicity of sulfonic group therefore it seems likely that chlorine treatment may also eliminate estrogenic activity induced by bps which warrants further verification by laboratory tests 3 5 effect of ha on chlorination of bps 3 5 1 effect of ha on reaction kinetics kinetic experiments were conducted to assess the effect of ha 0 5 2 mgc l during chlorination 30 μm of bps 1 μm at an environmentally relevant ph 7 fig 4 exhibited the time course profiles of bps degradation and chlorine loss respectively as can be seen the presence of ha appreciably suppressed the degradation of bps with the concentration of ha increasing from 0 to 2 mg c l the extent of bps loss greatly decreased from 86 to 46 at 15 min ha could competitively consume oxidant thus leading to the decrease of degradation rates gallard et al 2004 yang et al 2014 in order to account for this effect eq 9 was introduced to quantify the kinetics 9 c t c 0 exp k 0 t hocl d t where ct was the concentration of bps at a specific time t c0 was the initial concentration of bps and 0 t hocl dt was the chlorine concentration integrated over time i e chlorine exposure it was found that the predictions made according to eq 9 considerably overestimated the level of bps loss in the presence of ha si fig 14 in addition the transformation rate constants k at different concentrations of ha could be obtained by eq 9 as shown in fig 5 the rate constants k decreased with the increase of ha concentration similar inhibition was also observed in chlorination of tbrbpa which was reasonably explained by the fact that tbrbpa phenoxyl radicals formed by one electron chlorine oxidation were competitively reduced back to its parent by ha interestingly it was also found that ha had negligible influence on the degradation of bpa by chlorine where the reaction proceeded via chlorine electrophilic substitution gao et al 2016 considering the two channel pathways involved in chlorination of bps we tentatively proposed that ha inhibited the degradation of bps by chlorine via electron transfer pathway ii similar to the case of tbrbpa in parallel ha had negligible effect on the depletion of bps transformed via electrophile substitution pathway i similar to the case of bpa a two channel kinetic model was accordingly introduced to further characterize the effect of ha contaminants p was transformed by chlorine with the formation of intermediate p1 via electron transfer with a yield r and p2 via electrophilic substitution with a yield 1 r eq 10 p1 would be competitively reduced by ha to its original form p eq 11 in addition to its further irreversibly transformation eq 12 10 p chlorine k 4 r p 1 1 r p 2 11 p 1 ha k 5 p 12 p 1 k 6 products the reactions 10 and 11 were both second order to reactants where k 4 represented the rate constants in the absence of ha eq 10 and k 5 was the rate constants for the reaction of intermediate p1 with ha eq 11 k 6 was the first order rate constant for eq 12 therefore kinetic eqs 13 and 14 could be obtained to describe the degradation rate for p and the formation rate for p1 respectively 13 d p dt k 4 p chlorine k 5 p 1 ha 14 d p 1 dt r k 4 p chlorine k 6 p 1 k 5 p 1 ha by making a steady state assumption for p1 eq 15 could be obtained 15 d p dt k 4 1 r r k 6 k 5 ha k 6 p chlorine therefore the rate constant in the presence of ha could be described as eq 16 16 k ha k 4 1 r r k 6 k 5 ha k 6 k 4 1 r r k 5 k 6 ha 1 as can be seen in fig 5 the two channel kinetic model eq 16 could fit the experimental data well the values of r and k 5 k 6 was estimated to 0 64 0 02 and 1 66 0 18 respectively these results indicated that the contribution of electron transfer and electrophilic substitution pathway to bps degradation was around 64 and 36 respectively 3 5 2 effect of ha on products formation i products analysis the effect of ha on the products formation during chlorination of bps was also investigated no additional products were detected in the presence of ha compared to the case in the absence of ha data not shown this finding was similar to the scenario of chlorination of tbrbpa where ha had negligible impact on the products species either gao et al 2016 the influence of ha on products formation during oxidation processes e g permanganate ferrate and enzymatic catalysis was also investigated in previous work but confounding effects were reported gao et al 2016 li et al 2017 lu et al 2015 2017 lu and huang 2009 lu et al 2017 for instance li et al 2017 reported that ha negligibly influenced the products species in soybean catalyzed oxidation of triclosan on the contrary feng et al 2013 reported that ha affected the products species in laccase catalyzed oxidation of tbrbpa where additional new products with large molecular ions were detected in the presence of ha it seemed likely that the effect of ha on the products species was complex which might be associated with the nature of ha and the experimental conditions due to the complexity of ha molecular structure model compounds with defined structures were used to further explore the effect of ha in previous work 2 methoxyphenol was commonly used to mimic ha li et al 2017 lu and huang 2009 lu et al 2017 for instance lu and huang 2009 reported that the presence of 2 methoxyphenol in laccase catalysis oxidation of acetaminophen led to the formation of a new product resulting from the coupling of 2 methoxyphenol and acetamionphenol phenoxy radicals similarly cross coupling products were also detected in soybean peroxidase catalysis oxidation of triclosan in this work a new product with a molecular ion of 371 059 was detected when 2 methoxyphenol was present during chlorination of bps this new product was likely generated from cross coupling of bps and 2 methoxyphenol phenoxy radicals si fig 15 this finding in turn confirmed the occurrence of oxidative pathway during chlorination of bps interestingly several studies reported that co solvent methanol could affect the product species during bpa or tbrbpa oxidation e g by permanganate ferrate manganese dioxide or enzymatic catalysis oxidation which was also verified in this work si table s3 feng et al 2013 gao et al 2016 yang et al 2014 carbocation intermediates of 4 isopropylphenol or 2 6 dibromo 4 isopropylphenol formed during bpa or tbrbpa oxidation underwent substitution reactions with methanol other than water to generate 4 hydroxy isopropyl methanol or 2 6 dibromo hydroxy isopropyl methanol si table s3 similarly a new product with a molecular ion of 187 007 was detected in chlorination of bps when methanol was present this new product was suggested to be 4 hydroxy methyl benzenesulfonate si fig 16 which was derived from the substitution reaction of methanol and r3 intermediate this finding confirmed again the occurrence of oxidative pathway during chlorination of bps ii products evolution the time course profiles of transformation products of bps by chlorine in the absence vs presence of ha were comparatively monitored by the hplc esi qqq ms at mrm mode fig 6 in the absence of ha the consecutive formation of chlorinated bps generated through chlorine electrophilic substitution pathway was followed by their decay as a function of time where mono di tri tetrachloro bps reached their maxima at about 5 8 15 and 35 min respectively as the reaction proceeded tetrachloro bps became the only chlorinated bps congeners 4cp generated via electron transfer pathway was gradually accumulated within 15 min and then declined the maximum yield of 4cp was quantified by the authentic standard to be about 2 with respect to bps loss unfortunately the response values of bsa and polymeric products also generated via electron transfer pathway were too low and thus the formation dynamics of bsa and its chlorinated products as well as the two dimers were not followed in the presence of ha the formation of monochloro bps was also followed by its decay along with the reaction time but the occurrence of its maxima was prolonged to about 25 min dichloro bps and trichloro bps were gradually generated and then reached plateaus while tetrachloro bps was negligibly generated in particular the maximum yield of monochloro bps was calculated to be 0 53 by using peak areas i e dividing its peak area by the decreased peak area of bps due to the lack of authentic standard which was higher than that obtained in the absence of ha 0 40 along with reaction time 4cp slowly accumulated to a plateau and its maximum yield was calculated to be about 1 1 lower than that obtained in the absence of ha 2 these findings that ha increased the yield of monochloro bps and decreased the yield of 4cp were in consistent with the conclusion deduced from the two channel model where bps was transformed by two parallel pathways and ha could inhibit the degradation of bps via electron transfer pathway 4 conclusion this work firstly investigated the transformation of bps by chlorine including kinetics products mechanism and the effect of ha the following conclusions were obtained which might improve the understanding of chlorine chemistry in water treatment chlorine could effectively degrade bps over a wide ph range from 5 to 10 with the apparent second order rate constants of 7 6 435 3 m 1s 1 with a typical chlorine residual concentration of 2 mg l the half life time of bps was calculated to be around 0 94 3 2 min at ph 7 8 eleven products including chlorinated bps i e mono di tri tetrachloro bps 4cp bsa chlorinated bsa i e mono dichloro bsa and two dimers were detected by hplc esi qtof ms it was proposed that bps was transformed by chorine via two parallel pathways including chlorine electrophile substitution and electron transfer pathways the inhibitory effect of ha on bps degradation was reasonably explained by a two channel kinetic model where ha negligibly influenced electrophile substitution while appreciably inhibited the degradation of bps through electron transfer via reversing bps phenoxyl radical back to parent bps ha had negligible impact on the product species in chlorination of bps however in the presence of 2 methoxyphenol a new additional product was generated via cross coupling of bps and 2 methoxyphenol phenoxy radicals in the case of co solvent methanol 4 hydroxy methyl benzenesulfonate derived from the substitution reaction of methanol and an intermediate was generated acknowledgments this work was supported by the national

sydney nsw 2052 australia school of civil and environmental engineering unsw sydney nsw 2052 australia corresponding author stormwater constructed wetlands are not well characterised for their ability to remove pathogens which can pose public health risks during stormwater harvesting activities this study investigated the behaviour of faecal indicator organism escherichia coli e coli and reference pathogen campylobacter spp in stormwater constructed wetlands using a case study system located in melbourne australia grab sampling and event based monitoring revealed influent concentrations of e coli were typical of other urban stormwater studies yet campylobacter concentrations were orders of magnitude above those urban stormwater studies used to develop the australian guidelines for water recycling reached levels typical of raw domestic wastewater the wetland consistently removed e coli from stormwater mean log removal 0 96 range 0 19 1 79 while campylobacter spp concentrations were often higher in outflow than inflow mean log removal 0 05 range 0 9 1 25 these results indicate that e coli is a poor indicator for this reference pathogen the log reductions of both organisms also failed to meet the criteria specified for any end use as listed in the australian guidelines for water recycling suggesting further treatment is required prior to harvesting finally this study proposed that direct faecal deposition by waterfowl faeces was a microbial source to stormwater wetlands and that this was partly responsible for the varied microbial removal rates observed overall this work validates the need for further characterisation of pathogens in raw urban stormwater and the ability for water sensitive urban design features such as wetlands to remove both indicator and pathogenic microorganisms keywords campylobacter e coli direct faecal deposition urban stormwater harvesting constructed wetland event based sampling 1 introduction urbanization has caused an increase in stormwater runoff which can contain high levels of sediments nutrients chemicals and microorganisms horner et al 1994 consequently its introduction into the environment can lead to both degradation of natural water quality and increased public health risks wong 2006 however stormwater runoff can also be considered as an alternative water source with great potential in the application of harvesting technologies for its use as a non potable water source for toilet flushing and irrigation wood et al 2002 to achieve this careful stormwater management and treatment is required sustainable passive stormwater treatment systems such as wetlands biofilters and bio retention swales have been studied and implemented under integrated water management approaches such as water sensitive urban design wsud wong 2006 among these approaches stormwater constructed wetlands have advantages in providing both public amenities and serving as wildlife habitats while treating stormwater kadlec and wallace 2008 the main focus of this approach has been in protecting ecosystem health as it has shown promising results in removing nutrients and sediments hathaway and hunt 2009 however current knowledge on the performances of wetland systems in removing pollutants which pose public health risks such as microbial pathogens is very limited hathaway and hunt 2009 díaz et al 2010 the few studies that exist on removal of faecal microbes through constructed wetlands almost exclusively rely on non pathogenic faecal indicator organisms fios such as escherichia coli e coli enterococci and or total coliforms birch et al 2004 stenstrom and carlander 2001 hathaway and hunt 2010 wadzuk et al 2010 struck et al 2005 these studies show significant variation in wetland performance ranging from net export of indicator organisms to net removal beutel et al 2013 díaz et al 2010 stenstrom and carlander 2001 hathaway and hunt 2010 hathaway et al 2009 it is hypothesised that this large variance is caused by differences in site specific operational conditions e g inflow water quality climate and wetland design parameters e g hydraulic retention time and vegetation density díaz et al 2010 mendez et al 2009 davies and bavor 2000 furthermore the sampling method employed for monitoring e g often only grab samples are taken to derive removal performances can also influence the reported microbial removal rates because they don t account for inherent storage detention time in wetlands to specify when grab samples are taken however this hypothesis is still to be fully tested and further studies are required to determine the differences in removal rate estimates introduced by the chosen sampling method while monitoring of indicator organisms may help infer a wetland s ability to remove actual human pathogens direct measurements are often desirable due to known differences in survival attachment and sequestration processes between indicators and actual pathogens horman et al 2004 winfield and groisman 2003 for example campylobacter spp which is the leading cause of gastrointestinal disease in melbourne was never studied in wetland systems yet its survival and movement in environmental conditions is not necessarily represented by indicators such as e coli schang et al 2016 the few studies on campylobacter removal from other types of water treatment systems showed varying performances duggan et al 2001 page et al 2010 tondera et al 2013 supplementary material knowledge on the removal of these pathogens is crucial for understanding human health risks associated with the application of harvested stormwater to local public amenities i e sporting fields and parkland irrigation therefore further research is required to understand 1 the removal of faecal pathogens in wetland systems and 2 whether their removal can be estimated by commonly used indicator organisms once faecal microbes enter a constructed wetland their fate and transport and hence overall removal is governed by several processes natural survival processes impacted by uv radiation salinity and ph mendez et al 2009 struck et al 2008 quiñónez dìaz et al 2001 competition struck et al 2008 predation malaviya and singh 2012 presence of vegetation gersberg et al 1987 garcia and bécares 1997 karim et al 2004 and sedimentation and attachment processes davies and bavor 2000 jamieson et al 2005 while the combined effect of these above processes could result in the removal of faecal microbes from the water column the reported poor removal performances especially leaching of fios from wetlands may indicate alternative competing processes contributing faecal organisms to stormwater constructed wetlands one recognised process present mainly within shallow water bodies is resuspension by incoming water flow and wind weiskel et al 1996 davies colley et al 2004 importantly the survival time of microbes are prolonged in sediments making them a perfect reservoir hathaway et al 2011 stenstrom and carlander 2001 waterfowl activity in stormwater constructed wetlands has also been suggested as a source contributing to faecal microbes in constructed wetlands weiskel et al 1996 fleming and fraser 2001 this is because waterfowl frequently inhabit the open water zone of wetlands defecating directly into water and they are known to be carriers of human pathogens such as campylobacter spp van dyke et al 2010 abulreesh et al 2006 although previous studies have suggested that direct deposition by waterfowls can be a significant source of faecal microorganisms in water bodies grant et al 2001 valiela et al 1991 weiskel et al 1996 there are no studies that focus on the impact of direct faeces deposition into urban stormwater constructed wetlands nor any on campylobacter spp therefore the critical knowledge gaps in this area have been identified 1 the removal efficiency of reference pathogen campylobacter by stormwater wetland systems require further study 2 consequently their removal efficiency needs to be compared to that of fios i e e coli and 3 the potential impact of direct faecal deposition by waterfowl on the microbial water quality in stormwater wetland systems this study reports the pathogen removal performance of the troups creek stormwater constructed wetland it also looks into the following research objectives 1 understanding the levels of campylobacter spp in urban stormwater from a mixed land use catchment 2 understanding the removal capacity of a constructed stormwater wetland to remove a faecal indicator organism e coli and a reference pathogen campylobacter spp and whether the system was capable of meeting the australian guidelines for water recycling 3 whether e coli is a reliable indicator of the removal of faecal contamination in urban wetlands and 4 whether direct faecal deposition by waterfowl impacts the wetland s microbial water quality although this work was carried out in just one stormwater wetland it allows for the first time in literature insight into how campylobacter spp behaves in stormwater constructed wetlands and the links it has with commonly used indicators along with the relationship it has with waterfowl activity 2 methodology 2 1 site description this study was conducted at troups creek wetland which is in narre warren north melbourne australia this surface flow wetland is located at the end of the troups creek west branch catchment receiving water from 1020 ha mixed land use catchment 23 imperviousness fig 1 fig 2 comprising of mainly low density residential developments and smaller areas of peri urban usage and commercial shopping districts the wetland outflow is extracted and further treated via a comprehensive treatment train including gross screening coagulation sand filtration activated carbon filters occasional ultrafiltration ultraviolet radiation and chlorination before being distributed to a local urban stormwater harvesting scheme serving roughly 58 households for non potable uses toilet flushing and irrigation it is noted that this study focuses only on the wetland itself not on the additional treatment conducted after wetland outflow troups creek wetland fig 2 has several water inflow channels the major inflow is from inlet channel in in fig 2 which conveys runoff from urban and agricultural areas 90 of total catchment areas 79 of the catchment s imperviousness areas there are three small stormwater drains sw1 sw2 and sw3 in fig 2 representing 6 of the total catchment area 13 of the catchment s impervious areas additionally treated water from a small offside wetland sw4 in fig 2 4 of the total catchment area 8 of the catchment s impervious areas enters the troups creek wetland troups creek wetland has one outlet out in fig 2 which has an adjustable weir overflow system that controls water level this weir was not modified during the monitoring period it is to be noted that the troups creek wetland macrophyte zone approximately 4200 m2 is severely undersized based on wsud engineering procedures mw 2005 the critical macrophytes zone is recommended to be 2 5 of impervious area in order to achieve the best practice environment management objectives for stormwater quality tss tn and tp based on this criterion the critical macrophytes zone for this wetland should be 58 650 m2 this poor design of the wetland s macrophyte zone is not uncommon in melbourne where a lack of plants is a major issue thus this case study provides a representation of wetlands in the melbourne area and possibly around australia 2 2 monitoring and sampling 2 2 1 monitoring stations and equipment troups creek wetland was monitored from march 2014 to may 2016 two flow monitoring stations in and out fig 2 were established onsite to characterise major water flows into and out of the wetland at the wetland inlet in water velocity and level were measured using two hach fl900av flow meters hach usa velocity and depth measurements were used with inlet channel dimensions to derive inflow rates additionally a greenspan ts1000 turbidity sensor pentair usa and a campbell scientific 108 temperature sensor campbell scientific australia were also installed all data was logged on a campbell cr1000 logger and two hach sigma 950 loggers hach usa a sigma 900 hach usa auto sampler was installed within the main inlet sampling hut to enable collection of multiple samples during storm events the wetland outlet out monitoring station had a greenspan pressure based depth sensor and a greenspan ts1000 turbidity sensor with lens protection 0 2000 ntu range the outlet sampling hut contained a campbell cr1000 logger and a sigma 900 auto sampler 2 2 2 grab sampling grab samples were collected at both monitoring stations on a weekly basis during grab sampling 2 l water samples were taken from each of the sampling points fig 2 sws were only sampled when water was not stagnant water quality temperature turbidity salinity ph ec and do was measured simultaneously using a horiba u 52 multiprobe water quality meter horiba japan in total 50 grab sampling days were carried out between april 2014 and may 2016 2 2 3 event based discrete sampling in total 22 events were captured between april 2014 and may 2016 which included collection of over 1600 individual samples auto samplers installed at in and out were used to collect water samples during wet weather events the auto samplers were programmed to sample 250 ml every 30 min filling a one litre bottle every two hours each auto sampler was equipped with 24 bottles the samplers were reset and bottles were collected every 24 h this allowed for optimal spread of collection even over the span of long tailed outflow hydrograph for the final fourteen events the inlet sampling regime was adjusted to volume weighted sampling methodology where 4 250 ml samples were composited into a one litre container using constant volume intervals 175 kl estimated based on previous event size and duration this was done to increase the number of samples taken at inlets during each event and hence accuracy of the inlet s estimated event and site mean concentrations to cope with the high residence time of the wetland outlet samples were continuously collected using auto samplers for 3 4 days after each event after that grab samples were collected from each site every other day until the outlet reached baseline flow conditions all samples were retrieved from the field and transported to the environmental and public health microbiology ephm laboratory for analysis within 24hrs of sample collection usually less than 9 h mccarthy 2009 additionally volume weighted composites were made from each of the event based discrete samples on each sampling day 2 2 4 dry wet weather designation all collected water samples were grouped into two sampling regimes dry weather or wet weather based on the following criteria if total rainfall of the previous 24 h was less than 1 mm at in fig 1 it was considered a dry weather sample similarly at out fig 1 it was considered a dry weather sample when total rainfall in the previous 96 h was less than 1 mm for out an additional 72 h was imposed in addition to the 24hr antecedent period to account for the wetland s retention time 2 2 5 sediment bird counts and faecal sampling wetland bed sediment samples were collected using sterile steel corers on a monthly basis only the top 10 cm layer of sediment from four locations across the wetland were collected s1 s2 s3 and s4 in fig 2 in order to estimate the contribution of waterfowl faeces to wetland microbial concentration the number of waterfowl observed in and around the wetland was recorded on each grab sampling day photographs of waterfowl were taken for additional species confirmation faecal samples were also collected when possible using sterile spatulas and placed into sterile food grade bags three types of waterfowl faeces were found around the troups creek wetland wood ducks p3 swamphen p2 and an as yet unidentified waterfowl p1 all sediment and faeces samples were kept on ice during transportation to ephm lab for analysis on the same day 2 3 sample analysis all event based samples i e discrete samples taken over the event hydrograph were analysed for e coli concentrations composite samples compiled from the event based discrete samples grab samples as well as sediment and faecal samples were analysed for e coli and campylobacter spp our chosen reference pathogen based on the current australian stormwater harvesting and reuse guidelines nhmrc 2009 2 3 1 e coli e coli was analysed following the most probable number mpn assays colilert as per the manufacturer s instructions dilution factors for water samples were 1 10 and 1 20 for dry and wet weather water samples respectively each sediment sample was divided into three subsamples one subsample of about 0 5 g was stored in eppendorf tubes and placed in 20 c freezer for future dna analysis another weighted subsample was oven dried at 105 c for 48 h to measure moisture content the last subsample 1 g wet weight was suspended in a 50 ml mixture of 45 ml sterile deionised water and 5 ml 0 5 tween 20 solution this mixture was vortexed for 15 s mixed in a slow rotator at 10 15 rpm for 20 min followed by centrifugation for 7 min at 400 x rcf 4 c a 20 ml aliquot of the supernatant was then analysed using the colilert methods 1 5 dilution factor finally these results were converted to mpn g dry weight using the calculated moisture content faecal samples from waterfowl were also analysed using the method described above for sediment samples except that prior to colilert analysis a 1 ml aliquot of the supernatant was diluted in 9 ml of sterile di water 1 10 initial dilution 1 ml and 0 01 ml of this 1 10 diluted mixture was then analysed using the colilert methods whichever dilution gave the higher positive cell numbers was used to estimate the final concentrations the detection range of e coli in water samples was 10 24 000 mpn 100 ml for dilution factor 1 10 and 20 48 000 mpn 100 ml for dilution factor 1 20 in faecal and sediment samples the detection range was 1000 2 400 000 mpn 1 g wet weight and 5 12 000 mpn 1 g wet weight respectively microbial concentrations below the lowest detection limit were taken as the lowest detection limit and microbial concentrations above the highest detection limit were taken as the highest detection limit for analysis however this only occurred in 4 2 and 0 1 of the samples respectively 2 3 2 campylobacter spp campylobacter spp was analysed using the australian new zealand standard as nzs 4276 19 2001 as nzs 2001 with the following modifications 11 tube mpn was carried out on water samples by filtering the following volumes of water through 0 45 μm filters 100 ml 1 50 ml 2 10 ml 2 1 ml 3 and 0 5 ml 3 each filter was placed in 25 ml preston s nutrient broth due to resource constraints a 5 tube mpn was carried out on faecal samples by suspending the following wet faecal weights into 25 ml of preston s nutrient broth 0 02 g 0 002 g 0 0002 g 0 00002 g and 0 000002 g achieved through serial dilution for sediment samples the presence absence of campylobacter spp was tested through the addition of 2 g of material into 25 ml preston s nutrient broth followed by enrichment in addition to the australian standard s traditional enrichment culture and biochemical confirmation procedure a new mpn pcr method for detection and identification of campylobacter was tested in parallel henry et al 2015a in brief this method uses campylobacter specific primers on the enrichment broth to identify four pathogenic campylobacter species c jejuni c coli c lari and c upsalensis in this paper all results presented were based on the mpn pcr method because this method allows generation of a most probable concentration after 48 h instead of 96 h it is noted however that the australian standard method and the new mpn pcr method agreed on 92 2 of tubes of all tubes 6 0 were detected positive by the traditional enrichment method but negative by the mpn pcr method and this generally happened in large volumes 100 ml and 50 ml tubes where a biofilm can be observed on the top layer of the preston s broth after 48 h of incubation it is hypothesised that this biofilm layer may affect the accuracy of qpcr and therefore cause the reading to be a false negative there were also times in the mpn pcr method where one of the duplicate samples was positive and the other was negative the duplicate samples are only associated with the pcr method where one sample was analysed twice however this occurred for less than 5 of tubes and are always associated with large volumes usually the 100 ml tubes if this was the case the sample was recorded as positive the detection limits of campylobacter spp were 2 4 2600 mpn 1 g wet weight for faecal samples and 5 9 2900 mpn 1 l for water samples this wide range of detection limit is caused by the different ages of faecal material collected again microbial concentrations below the lowest detection limit were taken as the lowest detection limit and the microbial concentrations above the highest detection limit were taken as the highest detection limit for statistical analysis however this occurred only in 0 9 and 4 4 of samples respectively 2 4 data analysis 2 4 1 calculation of event mean concentrations event mean concentrations emcs were calculated for each storm event for both wetland inlet and outlet using equation 1 these emcs were then used to calculate percentage removal and log reduction of e coli and campylobacter spp according to equation 2 and equation 3 1 e m c v i c i v i where vi

an arithmetic faecal loading calculation was carried out to estimate the waterfowl s microbial contribution via direct deposition at troups creek wetland firstly mean daily load of microorganisms leaving the wetland was calculated using equation 4 4 l d a y c o u t q d r y 86400 where l d a y is the mean daily load of microorganisms leaving wetland system mpn day c o u t is the mean concentration of microorganisms in wetland outlet mpn l q d r y is the mean wetland outflow rate during dry weather condition l s followed by the calculation for daily mean microorganism contribution per bird and assuming that birds are defecating their daily faeces directly into the wetland equation 5 5 l w a t e r f o w l c f a e c e s r d e f e c a t i o n where l w a t e r f o w l is the mean daily contribution of microorganisns by each waterfowl mpn waterfowl day c f a e c e s is the mean concentration of microorganisms in waterfowl faeces mpn g r d e f e c a t i o n is the defecation rate by each waterfowl on a daily basis g waterfowl day equation 4 and equation 5 were then used to obtain the number of bird required to create the observed outflow microbial level equation 6 the assumptions here are that 1 all the birds daily faecal load enters the wetland directly 2 the faecal load by each bird is 100 mixed and 3 no die off or settling losses occur while these are gross assumptions the value obtained could place some context as to whether the observed bird counts described above could explain the levels observed at outlet 6 n w a t e r f o w l l d a y l w a t e r f o w l where n w a t e r f o w l is the number of waterfowl required to defecate into the wetland system each day to create the observed microorganism level at the wetland outlet 2 4 3 statistical analysis spearman rank correlation coefficients kirk 2008 were calculated between measured microbial concentrations and simultaneously measured environmental factors significance levels p were calculated for all statistical tests results with p 05 were deemed significant while results with p 01 were deemed highly significant t tests were also performed to determine if the microbial concentration between inlet and outlet or during different weather conditions within a single site were statistically different from one another 3 results and discussion 3 1 e coli and campylobacter in urban stormwater from a mixed land use catchment according to the grab sampling data the e coli concentration during dry weather at the wetland inlet median 2 6 103 mpn l was significantly lower than that derived during wet weather median 1 0 104 mpn l p 014 fig 3 the wet weather inflow e coli concentration at troups creek wetland was lower than that found in most urban stormwater drains nhmrc 2009 mean 5 9 105 mpn l davies and bavor 2000 ferguson et al 2003 young and thackston 1999 gannon 1988 this agrees with previous studies which demonstrate that larger catchments typically have lower less variable e coli concentrations than smaller more flasher ones mccarthy et al 2012 in contrast inlet concentration of the chosen reference pathogen campylobacter spp did not statistically differ between dry and wet weather conditions median 1 7 102 mpn l dry weather 9 8 102 mpn l wet weather p 144 fig 3 indeed high concentrations of campylobacter spp could be detected at inlet irrespective of weather conditions e g a campylobacter spp concentration of 1 4 103 mpn l was detected on 7 may 2014 during dry weather while on 13 may 2015 a campylobacter spp concentration of 1 7 103 mpn l was detected during wet weather periods these levels are higher than other urban stormwater drains and river systems nhmrc 2009 mean 33 mpn l nhmrc 2009 lampard et al 2012 mccarthy et al 2011 henry et al 2015b mccarthy and kolotelo 2013 dorner et al 2007 importantly the australian stormwater harvesting guidelines nhmrc 2009 have been developed based on very few stormwater samples of which the highest campylobacter concentration was 3 31 101 mpn l significantly lower than that found in this system in fact levels detected in troups creek wetland s inlet were closer to concentrations typically observed and reported in raw wastewater 100 100 000 mpn l nhmrc 2006 this finding together with the result of a catchment survey which revealed that septic tank systems were observed in the upstream catchment may suggest other sources such as leaking septic tanks or wastewater pipes contributed to these high campylobacter spp levels not to mention waterfowl living in and around the wetland 3 2 what is the removal performance of the wetland in the case of wetland s outflow dry weather e coli concentration was statistically lower than that of wet weather median concentration 3 6 102 mpn l 1 3 103 mpn l respectively t 3 26 p 002 fig 3 campylobacter spp data had the same pattern with the median concentration during dry weather lower than that of wet weather but the difference between the two was not significant median concentration 6 8 101 mpn l dry weather 3 2 102 mpn l wet weather t 1 09 p 286 fig 3 troups creek outflow concentrations were higher than those reported for equivalent systems díaz et al 2010 hathaway and hunt 2010 hathaway et al 2009 supplementary material by comparing inflow and outflow grab samples it was found that there was a statistically significant drop between inflow and outflow e coli concentrations during both dry and wet weather conditions p 001 however the same conclusion cannot be draw for campylobacter spp concentrations as the difference between inflow and outflow was not significant independent of weather conditions p 5 these results indicated that the troups creek wetland is removing e coli however its performance in removing campylobacter is poor especially during wet weather where median inflow and outflow concentrations are similar 9 8 102 mpn l inflow 3 2 102 mpn l outflow p 5 the event based sampling showed very similar trends fig 4 in that the system was able to consistently remove e coli indeed troups creek achieved an average log reduction of 0 96 for e coli over 22 events with the lowest log removal rate being 0 19 this is notable considering that others have shown that leaching of e coli i e negative removal rates is common in these wetland systems supplementary material especially those similar to troups creek which has inadequate macrophyte zones and is poorly designed constructed maintained although this is the first known paper to report campylobacter spp removal efficiency using event based data in urban stormwater wetlands the dataset was limited with just 11 events captured in their entirety however this data still reinforces the conclusions made from grab sampling datasets that the performance of this wetland for campylobacter spp removal is less consistent than that of e coli indeed the log reductions ranged from net removal to net leaching with a median of just 0 05 fig 4 possible explanations for the differences for campylobacter as compared to e coli could be that their sources are different e g waterfowl could be introducing one microbe in higher densities than others via direct faecal deposition another explanation could be that microbial removal processes in wetland system such as die off sedimentation filtration and adsorption by plant tissue brix 1997 gersberg et al 1987 garcia and bécares 1997 karim et al 2004 have different effects on e coli and campylobacter spp more specifically adsorption by plant tissue is referring to the process where microorganisms were attached to the surface of stems or leaves in the form of biofilms and therefore were removed from the water column brix 1997 while direct translation of these removal rates to other systems is not possible it is reassuring that these are likely to be conservative estimates and higher removal rates are expected in other more optimally designed wetlands around the world indeed the poor design of this wetland likely reduces its removal capacity including its undersized macrophyte zone excessive open water body zones and high water velocity which promote scouring and resuspension 3 3 is the harvested water safe for use as the harvesting of urban stormwater wetland effluent has been proposed wong 2006 our microbial water quality data was compared to the australian guidelines for water recycling managing health and environmental risks phase 2 stormwater harvesting and reuse nhmrc 2009 the guidelines for following end uses were compared 1 municipal and irrigation non food crops 2 irrigation of commercial food crops and dual reticulation with indoor and outdoor use and 3 firefighting by looking at event based datasets less than 25 of 22 monitored events met the e coli log reduction criteria 1 3 log reductions specified by nhmrc 2009 for municipal and irrigation of non food crops while none of the events met the e coli log reduction criteria of 2 4 specified for commercial food crop irrigation or dual reticulation with indoor outdoor use most importantly the effluent e coli concentrations found in all of these events failed to meet criteria for any end use specified nhmrc 2009 i e 1 0 102 mpn l supplementary material further treatment was required in order to harvest the wetland effluent for re use for the eleven events where campylobacter spp data was available average outflow campylobacter spp event mean concentrations emc were 2 46 103 mpn l which is significantly higher than the tolerable concentration found in nhmrc 2009 for municipal and irrigation of non food crops 7 60 10 1 mpn l supplementary material furthermore none of these events met the campylobacter log reduction criteria for any of the end uses specified by nhmrc 2009 further confirming that this effluent water may need additional treatment prior to harvesting it is expected that the additional treatment provided by the package treatment plant downstream of the wetland is capable of delivering high quality water prior to use at this site albeit with significant maintenance and operational costs while this downstream package plant is out of scope for this paper future work should investigate the performance of this system to treat wetland effluent 3 4 should we use e coli as an indicator a significant positive correlation was found between e coli and campylobacter spp concentration spearman s ρ 0 319 p 01 at wetland inlet suggesting that e coli could be used to represent the variability of campylobacter spp at this site however this work concluded that caution should be taken when using e coli to understand faecal contamination levels in multisource catchments especially since campylobacter was observed at concentrations typical of wastewater while e coli was found at typical stormwater concentrations two to three orders of magnitude lower than wastewater extending this work into quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra and future design of stormwater harvesting systems implies that site specific sampling should always be conducted until more accurate population models are available the 95th percentile stormwater concentrations of campylobacter spp measured here 2852 mpn l are much higher than the 95th percentile concentration suggested by nhmrc 2009 for urban stormwater i e 70 mpn l in untreated stormwater from urban catchments again suggesting site specificity of campylobacter spp concentrations and that much more data is required for qmras that rely on generalised urban stormwater concentrations other authors have verified that stormwater campylobacter spp concentrations can be much higher than reported in nhmrc 2009 henry et al 2015b lampard et al 2012 suggesting an update for these guidelines is needed the inability to use e coli as an indicator for the behaviour of campylobacter is further reinforced by event based sampling which showed that e coli was consistently removed by troups creek wetland log reductions between 0 19 and 1 79 fig 4 while log reductions for campylobacter spp varied from net leaching to net removal 0 9 to 1 25 fig 4 in this case utilising e coli as an indicator would have significantly overestimated the removal of bacterial reference pathogen campylobacter spp moreover the correlation between e coli and campylobacter spp log reduction was not statistically significant spearman s ρ 0 169 p 5 nor was the correlation between e coli and campylobacter spp concentration in the outflow spearman s ρ 0 240 p 0 5 this further suggests that the variability in campylobacter spp removal was not explained by the variability in e coli removal therefore the use of indicator e coli in representing the wetland removal processes of reference pathogen campylobacter spp is not supported in this wetland and may not be supported in similar wetlands 3 5 should grab sampling be used to assess the average performance of a wetland the datasets were used to calculate the average removal rates in three ways most commonly employed in literature 1 using groups of paired grab samples whereby the concentration of almost simultaneously collected inlet and outlet samples are used to calculate removal rates 2 comparing distributions of grab samples taken from inlet and outlet and 3 using the detailed wet weather sampling regime outlined in this paper while the former two methods are easier and cheaper to conduct the detailed regime used in this paper estimates a significantly higher log reduction of e coli and campylobacter spp in this wetland table 1 3 6 waterfowl as a source of contamination 3 6 1 is direct deposition of wetland waterfowl faeces a source of pathogens to the wetland in the waterfowl faeces collected from around the wetland campylobacter spp concentrations ranged from 2 5 to 1 1 106 mpn g dry weight fig 5 which is a much wider range than that previously reported in similar animal scats by dallas et al 2009 7 103 to 4 105 mpn g dry weights e coli concentrations also had a wide range from 2 5 102 g to 2 1 108 g dry weights fig 5 it is clear that if these faeces enter the wetland waterfowl could be a significant source of contamination in fact based on our arithmetic faecal loading calculation the number of waterfowl required to defecate directly into the wetland to produce the effluent e coli levels was 58 which is similar to that were observed during our regular bird counts at the wetland average of 77 maximum of 250 the number of waterfowl required to reach the campylobacter spp level was 1188 table 2 however it is to be noted that the bird counts are potentially largely underestimated because it was merely a snapshot of one period during one day per week and did not account for those birds roosting in nearby trees or wetland fringe vegetation that couldn t be seen furthermore this calculation has the assumption of 100 mixing no die off no settling and etc hence the results only provide an approximate assessment of potential impact of direct faecal deposition a significant positive correlation was found between campylobacter spp concentration of wetland outlet water column and bird count spearman s ρ 0 563 p 01 n 26 which supports the hypothesis that direct faecal deposition by waterfowl is a source to the wetland although the faecal loading estimation above shows that it takes 1188 waterfowl to defecate into the wetland system to create the observed campylobacter spp concentration in wetland outflow it does not necessarily disagree with the positive correlation it is hypothesised that this is due to the extraordinarily high level of campylobacter sp found in wetland inflow hence the direct faecal deposition calculation could be biased on the other hand while faecal loading estimation suggested that e coli from waterfowl faeces may be a significant contribution to wetland outflow e coli concentration there was no significant correlation found between e coli concentration of wetland outlet water column and bird count this conflict could reflect the significant assumptions and uncertainties inherent in the faecal loading calculations conducted here for example the assumption of complete mixing was found to be false when we trialled a number of faecal suspension tests which demonstrated that while some waterfowl faeces disintegrate quickly many will sink as a whole unit to the bed sediments it is well known that bed sediments can improve the survival of faecal microbes and since e coli and campylobacter spp survive at different rates stenstrom and carlander 2001 rates of resuspension of viable organisms during high flow periods may also differ finally it is possible that since e coli has been known to survive longer in water environments such as wetlands leading to the fact that the detected e coli could be from sources other than direct deposition this caused the lack of correlation between e coli concentration in water column and bird count 4 conclusion this work has resulted in a number of key outcomes which include 1 e coli should not be used to indicate faecal contamination levels in mixed land use catchments especially since campylobacter levels were similar to wastewater yet e coli levels were three to four orders of magnitude lower 2 e coli was consistently removed in this poorly designed wetland with an average of almost 90 reduction being achieved campylobacter was not consistently removed and often leached from the wetland further confirming the inaccuracies and potential over estimates of using e coli as an indicator 3 further treatment is required on this poorly designed wetland prior to harvesting for any end use for compliance 4 using grab sampling methodologies to assess average removal in wetlands will provide underestimates 5 strong support was observed for the hypothesis that waterfowl are a significant source of campylobacter spp to the wetland acknowledgements the authors wish

sydney nsw 2052 australia school of civil and environmental engineering unsw sydney nsw 2052 australia corresponding author stormwater constructed wetlands are not well characterised for their ability to remove pathogens which can pose public health risks during stormwater harvesting activities this study investigated the behaviour of faecal indicator organism escherichia coli e coli and reference pathogen campylobacter spp in stormwater constructed wetlands using a case study system located in melbourne australia grab sampling and event based monitoring revealed influent concentrations of e coli were typical of other urban stormwater studies yet campylobacter concentrations were orders of magnitude above those urban stormwater studies used to develop the australian guidelines for water recycling reached levels typical of raw domestic wastewater the wetland consistently removed e coli from stormwater mean log removal 0 96 range 0 19 1 79 while campylobacter spp concentrations were often higher in outflow than inflow mean log removal 0 05 range 0 9 1 25 these results indicate that e coli is a poor indicator for this reference pathogen the log reductions of both organisms also failed to meet the criteria specified for any end use as listed in the australian guidelines for water recycling suggesting further treatment is required prior to harvesting finally this study proposed that direct faecal deposition by waterfowl faeces was a microbial source to stormwater wetlands and that this was partly responsible for the varied microbial removal rates observed overall this work validates the need for further characterisation of pathogens in raw urban stormwater and the ability for water sensitive urban design features such as wetlands to remove both indicator and pathogenic microorganisms keywords campylobacter e coli direct faecal deposition urban stormwater harvesting constructed wetland event based sampling 1 introduction urbanization has caused an increase in stormwater runoff which can contain high levels of sediments nutrients chemicals and microorganisms horner et al 1994 consequently its introduction into the environment can lead to both degradation of natural water quality and increased public health risks wong 2006 however stormwater runoff can also be considered as an alternative water source with great potential in the application of harvesting technologies for its use as a non potable water source for toilet flushing and irrigation wood et al 2002 to achieve this careful stormwater management and treatment is required sustainable passive stormwater treatment systems such as wetlands biofilters and bio retention swales have been studied and implemented under integrated water management approaches such as water sensitive urban design wsud wong 2006 among these approaches stormwater constructed wetlands have advantages in providing both public amenities and serving as wildlife habitats while treating stormwater kadlec and wallace 2008 the main focus of this approach has been in protecting ecosystem health as it has shown promising results in removing nutrients and sediments hathaway and hunt 2009 however current knowledge on the performances of wetland systems in removing pollutants which pose public health risks such as microbial pathogens is very limited hathaway and hunt 2009 díaz et al 2010 the few studies that exist on removal of faecal microbes through constructed wetlands almost exclusively rely on non pathogenic faecal indicator organisms fios such as escherichia coli e coli enterococci and or total coliforms birch et al 2004 stenstrom and carlander 2001 hathaway and hunt 2010 wadzuk et al 2010 struck et al 2005 these studies show significant variation in wetland performance ranging from net export of indicator organisms to net removal beutel et al 2013 díaz et al 2010 stenstrom and carlander 2001 hathaway and hunt 2010 hathaway et al 2009 it is hypothesised that this large variance is caused by differences in site specific operational conditions e g inflow water quality climate and wetland design parameters e g hydraulic retention time and vegetation density díaz et al 2010 mendez et al 2009 davies and bavor 2000 furthermore the sampling method employed for monitoring e g often only grab samples are taken to derive removal performances can also influence the reported microbial removal rates because they don t account for inherent storage detention time in wetlands to specify when grab samples are taken however this hypothesis is still to be fully tested and further studies are required to determine the differences in removal rate estimates introduced by the chosen sampling method while monitoring of indicator organisms may help infer a wetland s ability to remove actual human pathogens direct measurements are often desirable due to known differences in survival attachment and sequestration processes between indicators and actual pathogens horman et al 2004 winfield and groisman 2003 for example campylobacter spp which is the leading cause of gastrointestinal disease in melbourne was never studied in wetland systems yet its survival and movement in environmental conditions is not necessarily represented by indicators such as e coli schang et al 2016 the few studies on campylobacter removal from other types of water treatment systems showed varying performances duggan et al 2001 page et al 2010 tondera et al 2013 supplementary material knowledge on the removal of these pathogens is crucial for understanding human health risks associated with the application of harvested stormwater to local public amenities i e sporting fields and parkland irrigation therefore further research is required to understand 1 the removal of faecal pathogens in wetland systems and 2 whether their removal can be estimated by commonly used indicator organisms once faecal microbes enter a constructed wetland their fate and transport and hence overall removal is governed by several processes natural survival processes impacted by uv radiation salinity and ph mendez et al 2009 struck et al 2008 quiñónez dìaz et al 2001 competition struck et al 2008 predation malaviya and singh 2012 presence of vegetation gersberg et al 1987 garcia and bécares 1997 karim et al 2004 and sedimentation and attachment processes davies and bavor 2000 jamieson et al 2005 while the combined effect of these above processes could result in the removal of faecal microbes from the water column the reported poor removal performances especially leaching of fios from wetlands may indicate alternative competing processes contributing faecal organisms to stormwater constructed wetlands one recognised process present mainly within shallow water bodies is resuspension by incoming water flow and wind weiskel et al 1996 davies colley et al 2004 importantly the survival time of microbes are prolonged in sediments making them a perfect reservoir hathaway et al 2011 stenstrom and carlander 2001 waterfowl activity in stormwater constructed wetlands has also been suggested as a source contributing to faecal microbes in constructed wetlands weiskel et al 1996 fleming and fraser 2001 this is because waterfowl frequently inhabit the open water zone of wetlands defecating directly into water and they are known to be carriers of human pathogens such as campylobacter spp van dyke et al 2010 abulreesh et al 2006 although previous studies have suggested that direct deposition by waterfowls can be a significant source of faecal microorganisms in water bodies grant et al 2001 valiela et al 1991 weiskel et al 1996 there are no studies that focus on the impact of direct faeces deposition into urban stormwater constructed wetlands nor any on campylobacter spp therefore the critical knowledge gaps in this area have been identified 1 the removal efficiency of reference pathogen campylobacter by stormwater wetland systems require further study 2 consequently their removal efficiency needs to be compared to that of fios i e e coli and 3 the potential impact of direct faecal deposition by waterfowl on the microbial water quality in stormwater wetland systems this study reports the pathogen removal performance of the troups creek stormwater constructed wetland it also looks into the following research objectives 1 understanding the levels of campylobacter spp in urban stormwater from a mixed land use catchment 2 understanding the removal capacity of a constructed stormwater wetland to remove a faecal indicator organism e coli and a reference pathogen campylobacter spp and whether the system was capable of meeting the australian guidelines for water recycling 3 whether e coli is a reliable indicator of the removal of faecal contamination in urban wetlands and 4 whether direct faecal deposition by waterfowl impacts the wetland s microbial water quality although this work was carried out in just one stormwater wetland it allows for the first time in literature insight into how campylobacter spp behaves in stormwater constructed wetlands and the links it has with commonly used indicators along with the relationship it has with waterfowl activity 2 methodology 2 1 site description this study was conducted at troups creek wetland which is in narre warren north melbourne australia this surface flow wetland is located at the end of the troups creek west branch catchment receiving water from 1020 ha mixed land use catchment 23 imperviousness fig 1 fig 2 comprising of mainly low density residential developments and smaller areas of peri urban usage and commercial shopping districts the wetland outflow is extracted and further treated via a comprehensive treatment train including gross screening coagulation sand filtration activated carbon filters occasional ultrafiltration ultraviolet radiation and chlorination before being distributed to a local urban stormwater harvesting scheme serving roughly 58 households for non potable uses toilet flushing and irrigation it is noted that this study focuses only on the wetland itself not on the additional treatment conducted after wetland outflow troups creek wetland fig 2 has several water inflow channels the major inflow is from inlet channel in in fig 2 which conveys runoff from urban and agricultural areas 90 of total catchment areas 79 of the catchment s imperviousness areas there are three small stormwater drains sw1 sw2 and sw3 in fig 2 representing 6 of the total catchment area 13 of the catchment s impervious areas additionally treated water from a small offside wetland sw4 in fig 2 4 of the total catchment area 8 of the catchment s impervious areas enters the troups creek wetland troups creek wetland has one outlet out in fig 2 which has an adjustable weir overflow system that controls water level this weir was not modified during the monitoring period it is to be noted that the troups creek wetland macrophyte zone approximately 4200 m2 is severely undersized based on wsud engineering procedures mw 2005 the critical macrophytes zone is recommended to be 2 5 of impervious area in order to achieve the best practice environment management objectives for stormwater quality tss tn and tp based on this criterion the critical macrophytes zone for this wetland should be 58 650 m2 this poor design of the wetland s macrophyte zone is not uncommon in melbourne where a lack of plants is a major issue thus this case study provides a representation of wetlands in the melbourne area and possibly around australia 2 2 monitoring and sampling 2 2 1 monitoring stations and equipment troups creek wetland was monitored from march 2014 to may 2016 two flow monitoring stations in and out fig 2 were established onsite to characterise major water flows into and out of the wetland at the wetland inlet in water velocity and level were measured using two hach fl900av flow meters hach usa velocity and depth measurements were used with inlet channel dimensions to derive inflow rates additionally a greenspan ts1000 turbidity sensor pentair usa and a campbell scientific 108 temperature sensor campbell scientific australia were also installed all data was logged on a campbell cr1000 logger and two hach sigma 950 loggers hach usa a sigma 900 hach usa auto sampler was installed within the main inlet sampling hut to enable collection of multiple samples during storm events the wetland outlet out monitoring station had a greenspan pressure based depth sensor and a greenspan ts1000 turbidity sensor with lens protection 0 2000 ntu range the outlet sampling hut contained a campbell cr1000 logger and a sigma 900 auto sampler 2 2 2 grab sampling grab samples were collected at both monitoring stations on a weekly basis during grab sampling 2 l water samples were taken from each of the sampling points fig 2 sws were only sampled when water was not stagnant water quality temperature turbidity salinity ph ec and do was measured simultaneously using a horiba u 52 multiprobe water quality meter horiba japan in total 50 grab sampling days were carried out between april 2014 and may 2016 2 2 3 event based discrete sampling in total 22 events were captured between april 2014 and may 2016 which included collection of over 1600 individual samples auto samplers installed at in and out were used to collect water samples during wet weather events the auto samplers were programmed to sample 250 ml every 30 min filling a one litre bottle every two hours each auto sampler was equipped with 24 bottles the samplers were reset and bottles were collected every 24 h this allowed for optimal spread of collection even over the span of long tailed outflow hydrograph for the final fourteen events the inlet sampling regime was adjusted to volume weighted sampling methodology where 4 250 ml samples were composited into a one litre container using constant volume intervals 175 kl estimated based on previous event size and duration this was done to increase the number of samples taken at inlets during each event and hence accuracy of the inlet s estimated event and site mean concentrations to cope with the high residence time of the wetland outlet samples were continuously collected using auto samplers for 3 4 days after each event after that grab samples were collected from each site every other day until the outlet reached baseline flow conditions all samples were retrieved from the field and transported to the environmental and public health microbiology ephm laboratory for analysis within 24hrs of sample collection usually less than 9 h mccarthy 2009 additionally volume weighted composites were made from each of the event based discrete samples on each sampling day 2 2 4 dry wet weather designation all collected water samples were grouped into two sampling regimes dry weather or wet weather based on the following criteria if total rainfall of the previous 24 h was less than 1 mm at in fig 1 it was considered a dry weather sample similarly at out fig 1 it was considered a dry weather sample when total rainfall in the previous 96 h was less than 1 mm for out an additional 72 h was imposed in addition to the 24hr antecedent period to account for the wetland s retention time 2 2 5 sediment bird counts and faecal sampling wetland bed sediment samples were collected using sterile steel corers on a monthly basis only the top 10 cm layer of sediment from four locations across the wetland were collected s1 s2 s3 and s4 in fig 2 in order to estimate the contribution of waterfowl faeces to wetland microbial concentration the number of waterfowl observed in and around the wetland was recorded on each grab sampling day photographs of waterfowl were taken for additional species confirmation faecal samples were also collected when possible using sterile spatulas and placed into sterile food grade bags three types of waterfowl faeces were found around the troups creek wetland wood ducks p3 swamphen p2 and an as yet unidentified waterfowl p1 all sediment and faeces samples were kept on ice during transportation to ephm lab for analysis on the same day 2 3 sample analysis all event based samples i e discrete samples taken over the event hydrograph were analysed for e coli concentrations composite samples compiled from the event based discrete samples grab samples as well as sediment and faecal samples were analysed for e coli and campylobacter spp our chosen reference pathogen based on the current australian stormwater harvesting and reuse guidelines nhmrc 2009 2 3 1 e coli e coli was analysed following the most probable number mpn assays colilert as per the manufacturer s instructions dilution factors for water samples were 1 10 and 1 20 for dry and wet weather water samples respectively each sediment sample was divided into three subsamples one subsample of about 0 5 g was stored in eppendorf tubes and placed in 20 c freezer for future dna analysis another weighted subsample was oven dried at 105 c for 48 h to measure moisture content the last subsample 1 g wet weight was suspended in a 50 ml mixture of 45 ml sterile deionised water and 5 ml 0 5 tween 20 solution this mixture was vortexed for 15 s mixed in a slow rotator at 10 15 rpm for 20 min followed by centrifugation for 7 min at 400 x rcf 4 c a 20 ml aliquot of the supernatant was then analysed using the colilert methods 1 5 dilution factor finally these results were converted to mpn g dry weight using the calculated moisture content faecal samples from waterfowl were also analysed using the method described above for sediment samples except that prior to colilert analysis a 1 ml aliquot of the supernatant was diluted in 9 ml of sterile di water 1 10 initial dilution 1 ml and 0 01 ml of this 1 10 diluted mixture was then analysed using the colilert methods whichever dilution gave the higher positive cell numbers was used to estimate the final concentrations the detection range of e coli in water samples was 10 24 000 mpn 100 ml for dilution factor 1 10 and 20 48 000 mpn 100 ml for dilution factor 1 20 in faecal and sediment samples the detection range was 1000 2 400 000 mpn 1 g wet weight and 5 12 000 mpn 1 g wet weight respectively microbial concentrations below the lowest detection limit were taken as the lowest detection limit and microbial concentrations above the highest detection limit were taken as the highest detection limit for analysis however this only occurred in 4 2 and 0 1 of the samples respectively 2 3 2 campylobacter spp campylobacter spp was analysed using the australian new zealand standard as nzs 4276 19 2001 as nzs 2001 with the following modifications 11 tube mpn was carried out on water samples by filtering the following volumes of water through 0 45 μm filters 100 ml 1 50 ml 2 10 ml 2 1 ml 3 and 0 5 ml 3 each filter was placed in 25 ml preston s nutrient broth due to resource constraints a 5 tube mpn was carried out on faecal samples by suspending the following wet faecal weights into 25 ml of preston s nutrient broth 0 02 g 0 002 g 0 0002 g 0 00002 g and 0 000002 g achieved through serial dilution for sediment samples the presence absence of campylobacter spp was tested through the addition of 2 g of material into 25 ml preston s nutrient broth followed by enrichment in addition to the australian standard s traditional enrichment culture and biochemical confirmation procedure a new mpn pcr method for detection and identification of campylobacter was tested in parallel henry et al 2015a in brief this method uses campylobacter specific primers on the enrichment broth to identify four pathogenic campylobacter species c jejuni c coli c lari and c upsalensis in this paper all results presented were based on the mpn pcr method because this method allows generation of a most probable concentration after 48 h instead of 96 h it is noted however that the australian standard method and the new mpn pcr method agreed on 92 2 of tubes of all tubes 6 0 were detected positive by the traditional enrichment method but negative by the mpn pcr method and this generally happened in large volumes 100 ml and 50 ml tubes where a biofilm can be observed on the top layer of the preston s broth after 48 h of incubation it is hypothesised that this biofilm layer may affect the accuracy of qpcr and therefore cause the reading to be a false negative there were also times in the mpn pcr method where one of the duplicate samples was positive and the other was negative the duplicate samples are only associated with the pcr method where one sample was analysed twice however this occurred for less than 5 of tubes and are always associated with large volumes usually the 100 ml tubes if this was the case the sample was recorded as positive the detection limits of campylobacter spp were 2 4 2600 mpn 1 g wet weight for faecal samples and 5 9 2900 mpn 1 l for water samples this wide range of detection limit is caused by the different ages of faecal material collected again microbial concentrations below the lowest detection limit were taken as the lowest detection limit and the microbial concentrations above the highest detection limit were taken as the highest detection limit for statistical analysis however this occurred only in 0 9 and 4 4 of samples respectively 2 4 data analysis 2 4 1 calculation of event mean concentrations event mean concentrations emcs were calculated for each storm event for both wetland inlet and outlet using equation 1 these emcs were then used to calculate percentage removal and log reduction of e coli and campylobacter spp according to equation 2 and equation 3 1 e m c v i c i v i where vi

an arithmetic faecal loading calculation was carried out to estimate the waterfowl s microbial contribution via direct deposition at troups creek wetland firstly mean daily load of microorganisms leaving the wetland was calculated using equation 4 4 l d a y c o u t q d r y 86400 where l d a y is the mean daily load of microorganisms leaving wetland system mpn day c o u t is the mean concentration of microorganisms in wetland outlet mpn l q d r y is the mean wetland outflow rate during dry weather condition l s followed by the calculation for daily mean microorganism contribution per bird and assuming that birds are defecating their daily faeces directly into the wetland equation 5 5 l w a t e r f o w l c f a e c e s r d e f e c a t i o n where l w a t e r f o w l is the mean daily contribution of microorganisns by each waterfowl mpn waterfowl day c f a e c e s is the mean concentration of microorganisms in waterfowl faeces mpn g r d e f e c a t i o n is the defecation rate by each waterfowl on a daily basis g waterfowl day equation 4 and equation 5 were then used to obtain the number of bird required to create the observed outflow microbial level equation 6 the assumptions here are that 1 all the birds daily faecal load enters the wetland directly 2 the faecal load by each bird is 100 mixed and 3 no die off or settling losses occur while these are gross assumptions the value obtained could place some context as to whether the observed bird counts described above could explain the levels observed at outlet 6 n w a t e r f o w l l d a y l w a t e r f o w l where n w a t e r f o w l is the number of waterfowl required to defecate into the wetland system each day to create the observed microorganism level at the wetland outlet 2 4 3 statistical analysis spearman rank correlation coefficients kirk 2008 were calculated between measured microbial concentrations and simultaneously measured environmental factors significance levels p were calculated for all statistical tests results with p 05 were deemed significant while results with p 01 were deemed highly significant t tests were also performed to determine if the microbial concentration between inlet and outlet or during different weather conditions within a single site were statistically different from one another 3 results and discussion 3 1 e coli and campylobacter in urban stormwater from a mixed land use catchment according to the grab sampling data the e coli concentration during dry weather at the wetland inlet median 2 6 103 mpn l was significantly lower than that derived during wet weather median 1 0 104 mpn l p 014 fig 3 the wet weather inflow e coli concentration at troups creek wetland was lower than that found in most urban stormwater drains nhmrc 2009 mean 5 9 105 mpn l davies and bavor 2000 ferguson et al 2003 young and thackston 1999 gannon 1988 this agrees with previous studies which demonstrate that larger catchments typically have lower less variable e coli concentrations than smaller more flasher ones mccarthy et al 2012 in contrast inlet concentration of the chosen reference pathogen campylobacter spp did not statistically differ between dry and wet weather conditions median 1 7 102 mpn l dry weather 9 8 102 mpn l wet weather p 144 fig 3 indeed high concentrations of campylobacter spp could be detected at inlet irrespective of weather conditions e g a campylobacter spp concentration of 1 4 103 mpn l was detected on 7 may 2014 during dry weather while on 13 may 2015 a campylobacter spp concentration of 1 7 103 mpn l was detected during wet weather periods these levels are higher than other urban stormwater drains and river systems nhmrc 2009 mean 33 mpn l nhmrc 2009 lampard et al 2012 mccarthy et al 2011 henry et al 2015b mccarthy and kolotelo 2013 dorner et al 2007 importantly the australian stormwater harvesting guidelines nhmrc 2009 have been developed based on very few stormwater samples of which the highest campylobacter concentration was 3 31 101 mpn l significantly lower than that found in this system in fact levels detected in troups creek wetland s inlet were closer to concentrations typically observed and reported in raw wastewater 100 100 000 mpn l nhmrc 2006 this finding together with the result of a catchment survey which revealed that septic tank systems were observed in the upstream catchment may suggest other sources such as leaking septic tanks or wastewater pipes contributed to these high campylobacter spp levels not to mention waterfowl living in and around the wetland 3 2 what is the removal performance of the wetland in the case of wetland s outflow dry weather e coli concentration was statistically lower than that of wet weather median concentration 3 6 102 mpn l 1 3 103 mpn l respectively t 3 26 p 002 fig 3 campylobacter spp data had the same pattern with the median concentration during dry weather lower than that of wet weather but the difference between the two was not significant median concentration 6 8 101 mpn l dry weather 3 2 102 mpn l wet weather t 1 09 p 286 fig 3 troups creek outflow concentrations were higher than those reported for equivalent systems díaz et al 2010 hathaway and hunt 2010 hathaway et al 2009 supplementary material by comparing inflow and outflow grab samples it was found that there was a statistically significant drop between inflow and outflow e coli concentrations during both dry and wet weather conditions p 001 however the same conclusion cannot be draw for campylobacter spp concentrations as the difference between inflow and outflow was not significant independent of weather conditions p 5 these results indicated that the troups creek wetland is removing e coli however its performance in removing campylobacter is poor especially during wet weather where median inflow and outflow concentrations are similar 9 8 102 mpn l inflow 3 2 102 mpn l outflow p 5 the event based sampling showed very similar trends fig 4 in that the system was able to consistently remove e coli indeed troups creek achieved an average log reduction of 0 96 for e coli over 22 events with the lowest log removal rate being 0 19 this is notable considering that others have shown that leaching of e coli i e negative removal rates is common in these wetland systems supplementary material especially those similar to troups creek which has inadequate macrophyte zones and is poorly designed constructed maintained although this is the first known paper to report campylobacter spp removal efficiency using event based data in urban stormwater wetlands the dataset was limited with just 11 events captured in their entirety however this data still reinforces the conclusions made from grab sampling datasets that the performance of this wetland for campylobacter spp removal is less consistent than that of e coli indeed the log reductions ranged from net removal to net leaching with a median of just 0 05 fig 4 possible explanations for the differences for campylobacter as compared to e coli could be that their sources are different e g waterfowl could be introducing one microbe in higher densities than others via direct faecal deposition another explanation could be that microbial removal processes in wetland system such as die off sedimentation filtration and adsorption by plant tissue brix 1997 gersberg et al 1987 garcia and bécares 1997 karim et al 2004 have different effects on e coli and campylobacter spp more specifically adsorption by plant tissue is referring to the process where microorganisms were attached to the surface of stems or leaves in the form of biofilms and therefore were removed from the water column brix 1997 while direct translation of these removal rates to other systems is not possible it is reassuring that these are likely to be conservative estimates and higher removal rates are expected in other more optimally designed wetlands around the world indeed the poor design of this wetland likely reduces its removal capacity including its undersized macrophyte zone excessive open water body zones and high water velocity which promote scouring and resuspension 3 3 is the harvested water safe for use as the harvesting of urban stormwater wetland effluent has been proposed wong 2006 our microbial water quality data was compared to the australian guidelines for water recycling managing health and environmental risks phase 2 stormwater harvesting and reuse nhmrc 2009 the guidelines for following end uses were compared 1 municipal and irrigation non food crops 2 irrigation of commercial food crops and dual reticulation with indoor and outdoor use and 3 firefighting by looking at event based datasets less than 25 of 22 monitored events met the e coli log reduction criteria 1 3 log reductions specified by nhmrc 2009 for municipal and irrigation of non food crops while none of the events met the e coli log reduction criteria of 2 4 specified for commercial food crop irrigation or dual reticulation with indoor outdoor use most importantly the effluent e coli concentrations found in all of these events failed to meet criteria for any end use specified nhmrc 2009 i e 1 0 102 mpn l supplementary material further treatment was required in order to harvest the wetland effluent for re use for the eleven events where campylobacter spp data was available average outflow campylobacter spp event mean concentrations emc were 2 46 103 mpn l which is significantly higher than the tolerable concentration found in nhmrc 2009 for municipal and irrigation of non food crops 7 60 10 1 mpn l supplementary material furthermore none of these events met the campylobacter log reduction criteria for any of the end uses specified by nhmrc 2009 further confirming that this effluent water may need additional treatment prior to harvesting it is expected that the additional treatment provided by the package treatment plant downstream of the wetland is capable of delivering high quality water prior to use at this site albeit with significant maintenance and operational costs while this downstream package plant is out of scope for this paper future work should investigate the performance of this system to treat wetland effluent 3 4 should we use e coli as an indicator a significant positive correlation was found between e coli and campylobacter spp concentration spearman s ρ 0 319 p 01 at wetland inlet suggesting that e coli could be used to represent the variability of campylobacter spp at this site however this work concluded that caution should be taken when using e coli to understand faecal contamination levels in multisource catchments especially since campylobacter was observed at concentrations typical of wastewater while e coli was found at typical stormwater concentrations two to three orders of magnitude lower than wastewater extending this work into quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra and future design of stormwater harvesting systems implies that site specific sampling should always be conducted until more accurate population models are available the 95th percentile stormwater concentrations of campylobacter spp measured here 2852 mpn l are much higher than the 95th percentile concentration suggested by nhmrc 2009 for urban stormwater i e 70 mpn l in untreated stormwater from urban catchments again suggesting site specificity of campylobacter spp concentrations and that much more data is required for qmras that rely on generalised urban stormwater concentrations other authors have verified that stormwater campylobacter spp concentrations can be much higher than reported in nhmrc 2009 henry et al 2015b lampard et al 2012 suggesting an update for these guidelines is needed the inability to use e coli as an indicator for the behaviour of campylobacter is further reinforced by event based sampling which showed that e coli was consistently removed by troups creek wetland log reductions between 0 19 and 1 79 fig 4 while log reductions for campylobacter spp varied from net leaching to net removal 0 9 to 1 25 fig 4 in this case utilising e coli as an indicator would have significantly overestimated the removal of bacterial reference pathogen campylobacter spp moreover the correlation between e coli and campylobacter spp log reduction was not statistically significant spearman s ρ 0 169 p 5 nor was the correlation between e coli and campylobacter spp concentration in the outflow spearman s ρ 0 240 p 0 5 this further suggests that the variability in campylobacter spp removal was not explained by the variability in e coli removal therefore the use of indicator e coli in representing the wetland removal processes of reference pathogen campylobacter spp is not supported in this wetland and may not be supported in similar wetlands 3 5 should grab sampling be used to assess the average performance of a wetland the datasets were used to calculate the average removal rates in three ways most commonly employed in literature 1 using groups of paired grab samples whereby the concentration of almost simultaneously collected inlet and outlet samples are used to calculate removal rates 2 comparing distributions of grab samples taken from inlet and outlet and 3 using the detailed wet weather sampling regime outlined in this paper while the former two methods are easier and cheaper to conduct the detailed regime used in this paper estimates a significantly higher log reduction of e coli and campylobacter spp in this wetland table 1 3 6 waterfowl as a source of contamination 3 6 1 is direct deposition of wetland waterfowl faeces a source of pathogens to the wetland in the waterfowl faeces collected from around the wetland campylobacter spp concentrations ranged from 2 5 to 1 1 106 mpn g dry weight fig 5 which is a much wider range than that previously reported in similar animal scats by dallas et al 2009 7 103 to 4 105 mpn g dry weights e coli concentrations also had a wide range from 2 5 102 g to 2 1 108 g dry weights fig 5 it is clear that if these faeces enter the wetland waterfowl could be a significant source of contamination in fact based on our arithmetic faecal loading calculation the number of waterfowl required to defecate directly into the wetland to produce the effluent e coli levels was 58 which is similar to that were observed during our regular bird counts at the wetland average of 77 maximum of 250 the number of waterfowl required to reach the campylobacter spp level was 1188 table 2 however it is to be noted that the bird counts are potentially largely underestimated because it was merely a snapshot of one period during one day per week and did not account for those birds roosting in nearby trees or wetland fringe vegetation that couldn t be seen furthermore this calculation has the assumption of 100 mixing no die off no settling and etc hence the results only provide an approximate assessment of potential impact of direct faecal deposition a significant positive correlation was found between campylobacter spp concentration of wetland outlet water column and bird count spearman s ρ 0 563 p 01 n 26 which supports the hypothesis that direct faecal deposition by waterfowl is a source to the wetland although the faecal loading estimation above shows that it takes 1188 waterfowl to defecate into the wetland system to create the observed campylobacter spp concentration in wetland outflow it does not necessarily disagree with the positive correlation it is hypothesised that this is due to the extraordinarily high level of campylobacter sp found in wetland inflow hence the direct faecal deposition calculation could be biased on the other hand while faecal loading estimation suggested that e coli from waterfowl faeces may be a significant contribution to wetland outflow e coli concentration there was no significant correlation found between e coli concentration of wetland outlet water column and bird count this conflict could reflect the significant assumptions and uncertainties inherent in the faecal loading calculations conducted here for example the assumption of complete mixing was found to be false when we trialled a number of faecal suspension tests which demonstrated that while some waterfowl faeces disintegrate quickly many will sink as a whole unit to the bed sediments it is well known that bed sediments can improve the survival of faecal microbes and since e coli and campylobacter spp survive at different rates stenstrom and carlander 2001 rates of resuspension of viable organisms during high flow periods may also differ finally it is possible that since e coli has been known to survive longer in water environments such as wetlands leading to the fact that the detected e coli could be from sources other than direct deposition this caused the lack of correlation between e coli concentration in water column and bird count 4 conclusion this work has resulted in a number of key outcomes which include 1 e coli should not be used to indicate faecal contamination levels in mixed land use catchments especially since campylobacter levels were similar to wastewater yet e coli levels were three to four orders of magnitude lower 2 e coli was consistently removed in this poorly designed wetland with an average of almost 90 reduction being achieved campylobacter was not consistently removed and often leached from the wetland further confirming the inaccuracies and potential over estimates of using e coli as an indicator 3 further treatment is required on this poorly designed wetland prior to harvesting for any end use for compliance 4 using grab sampling methodologies to assess average removal in wetlands will provide underestimates 5 strong support was observed for the hypothesis that waterfowl are a significant source of campylobacter spp to the wetland acknowledgements the authors wish
