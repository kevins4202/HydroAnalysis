16850,time series analyses are a crucial tool for uncovering the patterns and processes shaping microbial communities and their functions especially in aquatic ecosystems subsurface aquatic environments are perceived to be more stable than surface oceans and lakes due to the lack of sunlight the absence of photosysnthetically driven primary production low temperature variations and oligotrophic conditions however periodic groundwater recharge should affect the structure and succession of groundwater microbiomes to disentangle the long term temporal changes in bacterial communities of shallow fractured bedrock groundwater and identify the drivers of the observed patterns we analysed bacterial 16s rrna gene sequencing data for samples collected monthly from three groundwater wells over a six year period n 230 along a hillslope recharge area we showed that the bacterial communities in the groundwater of limestone mudstone alternations were not stable over time and exhibited non linear dissimilarity patterns which corresponded to periods of groundwater recharge further we observed an increase in dissimilarity over time generalized additive model p 0 001 indicating that the successive recharge events result in communities that are increasingly more dissimilar to the initial reference time point the sampling period was able to explain up to 29 5 of the variability in bacterial community composition and the impact of recharge events on the groundwater microbiome was linked to the strength of the recharge and local environmental selection many groundwater bacteria originated from the recharge related sources mean 66 5 sd 15 1 and specific bacterial taxa were identified as being either enriched or repressed during recharge events overall similar to surface aquatic environments the microbiomes in shallow fractured rock groundwater vary through time though we revealed groundwater recharges as unique driving factors for these patterns the high temporal resolution employed here highlights the dynamics of bacterial communities in groundwater which is an essential resource for the provision of clean drinking water understanding the biological complexities of these systems is therefore crucial graphical abstracts image graphical abstract keywords subsurface microbial ecology groundwater temporal autocorrelation temporal patterns

2011 investigating bacterial communities over long time scales and with high temporal resolution is a crucial requirement to comprehensively understand microbial community dynamics their drivers and their effects on ecosystem processes arguably the most comprehensive temporal research of environmental microbiomes has been conducted in aquatic systems shade et al 2013 there is evidence of seasonal patterns and annual periodicity in the composition of bacterial communities in lakes shade et al 2007 2013 li et al 2015 and surface oceans fuhrman et al 2006 gilbert et al 2012 morán et al 2015 ward et al 2017 wang et al 2020 specific marine taxa show preferences to either winter or summer seasons ward et al 2017 and the diversity of the marine bacterial communities is often found to be highest in winter months gilbert et al 2012 ladau et al 2013 although this does not always hold true ward et al 2017 however planktonic bacterial communities in streams do not exhibit seasonal patterns portillo et al 2012 indicating that temporal variation might be system specific and that not all aquatic bacterial communities show seasonal response patterns unlike surface freshwater and marine systems groundwater microbiomes have been largely ignored in temporal studies subsurface waters are not driven by seasonally varying primary production due to the lack of sunlight there is little temperature variation presumably little input of surface derived fresh easily available organic carbon akob and küsel 2011 benk et al 2019 and groundwater residence time can exceed those of rivers and lakes it was therefore assumed that groundwater microbial communities would be relatively stable over time griebler and lueders 2009 however these systems appear to be less constant than first assumed and there is evidence from short term studies 1 year that groundwater microbiomes exhibit seasonal dynamics associated with changes in groundwater chemistry and recharge events lin et al 2012 zelaya et al 2019 zhou et al 2012 it is likely that surface connectivity of an aquifer rock type and porosity all impact the amount of temporal variation observed farnleitner et al 2005 pronk et al 2009 küsel et al 2016 surface near groundwater especially could harbor temporally distinct microbial communities affecting its ecosystem functioning we have previously reported that space but not time plays a significant role in shaping groundwater bacterial communities in fractured mixed carbonate siliciclastic bedrock when comparing samples collected three months apart over three years but the high spatial variations observed could have masked temporal variabilities yan et al 2020 finer and longer time scales similar to marine time series research are needed to identify potential patterns shaping subsurface aquatic systems knowledge of the temporal dynamics of the groundwater microbiome may hold great promise for understanding and predicting the microbial structural and functional responses to precipitation changes and global warming stress on karst water resources which contribute to the drinking water supply for almost a quarter of the world s population ford and williams 2007 especially is likely to increase in the future in terms of both water quantity and quality hartmann et al 2014 therefore we aimed to disentangle the long term temporal changes in surface near groundwater bacterial communities and identify the drivers of the observed patterns for this study we took advantage of regular monthly sampling campaigns of groundwater from the monitoring transect of the hainich critical zone exploratory cze küsel et al 2016 in central germany the three selected monitoring wells represent contrasting depths surface connectivity and hydrochemistry we hypothesize that 1 the long observation time 6 years and high temporal resolution of our sampling will allow us to detect temporal variations within the groundwater microbiome of a fractured aquifer system 2 temporal patterns will vary between wells due to varying local conditions and environmental selection strength and 3 successive disturbances in the form of groundwater recharge events will drive the temporal variation through their impact on microbial diversity and abundance including the introduction of surface derived taxa 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site in the hainich cze a multi story

schloss et al 2009 following the miseq sop kozich et al 2013 sequences containing ambiguous n bases or homopolymers longer than 8 nucleotides were removed the remaining sequences were pre clustered allowing up to 1 bp difference per 100 bp to remove potential sequencing errors prior to the identification of the chimeric sequences using the uchime algorithm edgar et al 2011 after removing

deposited in the european sequence archive ena with bioproject ids and accession numbers as shown in supplementary table s1 2 5 statistical analysis statistical analyses were done using r version 3 5 2 and we used a significance level of α 0 05 for all statistical tests all r scripts for the statistical analyses are available at https github com pikatech cyclic patterns periods of increased seasonal recharge were identified in groundwater level time series as the periods between annual minima and maxima recession periods represent falling water levels generally due to limited surface recharge in general a period here labelled as p two digit year included one recession phase and one recharge phase p13 however only consists of a recharge phase the otus with relative abundance less than 0 005 were considered as run to run pcr and sequencing errors bokulich et al 2013 and were therefore removed to fix the variation in sampling depth library size cumulative sum scaling ccs a median like quantile normalization method was performed using r package metagenomeseq paulson et al 2013 prior to multivariate data analysis we plotted bacterial community dissimilarity bray curtis distance against sampling time interval days for all pairwise observations from the same well and a smooth curve was added using geom smooth to illustrate the non linear relationship between sampling time difference days and community dissimilarity generalized additive models gam were used as the smoothing method the smooth terms were all significant p 0 001 for all three wells indicating clearly nonlinear effect of time on bacterial community dissimilarity to visualize dissimilarities of bacterial community composition in each groundwater well an unconstrained ordination principal coordinates analysis pcoa was performed on the relative abundance data based on bray curtis distance variation partitioning analysis was done based on a 2 factorial permanova model bray curtis distance period recharge with significance tested using the default 999 permutations canonical analysis of principal coordinates cap was performed to test the relationships between the bacterial communities and the standardized hydrochemical parameters in each well based on bray curtis distance with 999 permutations using r package vegan oksanen et al 2007 linear dependencies between constraints were investigated via the variance inflation factor vif factors with vif 10 and non significant factors based on 999 permutations were removed from the model the shannon alpha diversity index was estimated from the raw data without normalization using the r package phyloseq mcmurdie and holmes 2013 since the values of the shannon diversity and bacterial 16s rrna gene abundance estimated from quantitative pcr were not normally distributed based on shapiro wilk test of normality we used non parametric methods for hypothesis testing non parametric one factorial kruskal wallis test was used to test the difference of bacterial diversity and abundance between the three wells if there was significant difference between the wells dunn test was used for multiple comparisons using r package fsa ogle 2015 the p values for multiple comparisons were adjusted using the benjamini hochberg method benjamini and hochberg 1995 the difference in bacterial alpha diversity and abundance between the recharge and the recession phases of each period was tested using non parametric wilcoxon method to unravel the effect of recharge events on the groundwater bacterial communities in each period we performed fast expectation maximization for microbial source tracking feast shenhav et al 2019 the feast method estimates the contribution in proportion of the input source conditions to the sink communities and also reports the fraction of the unknown source contribution i e 100 the fraction of the known source contribution here we used the recharge samples as sinks and the recession samples before the corresponding recharge period as sources in each period we considered the portion of the microbial community that feast could not assign as having been there before recharge i e during the previous recession phase labelled as unknown in the analyses output as having been introduced during recharge the physical source of this portion e g surface derived aeration zone attached cannot be determined non parametric kruskal wallis tests were used to test the differences in the proportion of unknown source between the defined periods for each well if there was significant difference of the unknown source contribution between the periods dunn test was used for multiple comparisons using r package fsa ogle 2015 the p values for multiple comparisons were adjusted using the benjamini hochberg method benjamini and hochberg 1995 to determine which taxa might be considered part of the recharge sourced portion of the communities we performed linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse segata et al 2011 threshold p 0 05 lda effect size 2 here we determined the bacterial markers that discriminated bacterial communities between phases of increased recharge and recession phases at all taxonomic levels due to the high temporal difference in the bacterial community data we only aimed to discover the bacterial taxa that were associated with recharge or recession phases irrespective of the period p14 p19 class recharge subclass period our dataset did not include a recession phase in p13 for pairwise comparison between recharge and recession phases so p13 data were not considered for lefse analysis 3 results 3 1 groundwater level and quality fluctuations in the aquifers the groundwater levels in the fractured mixed carbonate siliciclastic bedrock predominantly showed seasonal patterns with highstands in spring early summer and lowstands in early winter maximum water level fluctuations at h41 reached 27 3 m followed by h52 with 19 0 m and 3 m in the shallow well h43 fig 1c figure s1 s2 s3 groundwater recharge usually occurred from october to march april with peaks owing to snowmelt during summer recessions minor rises of water levels reflect groundwater recharge events predominantly after rainstorms with extreme amounts of precipitation 99 9th percentile see lehmann and totsche 2020 we assigned six h41 and h52 or seven h43 periods consisting of a consecutive recession and recharge phase fig 1b c in the shallower groundwater well h43 typically sinusoidal temperature fluctuations occurred with a mean of 9 2 c and amplitudes of 0 4 k that were delayed by 7 months in comparison to the air temperature recharge events only caused minor variation 0 1 k mostly cooling at the same location in a depth of 48 m mean 9 2 c seasonal temperature variation was 0 3 k whereas in the discharge direction temperatures in 65 m depth mean 9 6 c fluctuated by 0 1 k both coinciding with seasonal water level fluctuation the well h41 show considerable fluctuation in ca so4 2 dissolved oxygen no3 with fluctuating water levels and inverse variation of k mg na si and nh4 contrastingly the shallow well h43 show insignificant differences between recharge and recession phases only in comparison to the deep midslope well the deep well in discharge direction h52 is supplied by nh4 during recharge phases and by no3 during recessions whereas so4 2 mg and na vary correspondingly 3 2 groundwater bacterial community composition varied over time we assessed statistically significant temporal patterns in the dissimilarity of bacterial communities in all three wells the relative abundances of the most dominant classes varied over time within each well fig 2 a c in general with increasing time between two compared samples the dissimilarity of the bacterial communities in those samples also increased in a non linear manner gam p 0 001 for all wells fig 2d f however as indicated by the wide spread of the data points underlying this trend some samples collected further apart could show greater similarity than those collected within shorter time intervals overall bacterial community dissimilarity as reflected by the median bray curtis distance values was lowest in the h52 0 56 and higher in h41 0 64 and h43 0 67 the differences in dissimilarity between the three wells were statistically significant dunn s p values 0 001 for all pairwise comparisons supplementary figure s4 within a well for samples that were collected at different times of the year bacterial communities tended to be more dissimilar to each other when sampling was separated by roughly 6 18 or 30 months while communities were more similar when sampled at the same time of the year i e 12 24 or 36 months apart although this trend was not statistically significant fig 2d f we refer to these slight increases and decreases as oscillating patterns in bacterial community dissimilarity this pattern was most clearly observed for well h41 fig 2d the smooth terms for correlations were significant p 0 001 for all three wells indicating that the relationship between time and bacterial community dissimilarity was nonlinear this weak oscillating dissimilarity pattern at h41 was no longer observed when time interval between two samples was greater than three years after 6 years the communities exhibited a dissimilarity of over 0 7 in h52 and 0 8 in h41 and h43 fig 2d f 3 3 factors relating to changes in bacterial community over time differences in groundwater bacterial community structure in all three wells was significantly related to the different periods p13 p19 and phases recharge recession period alone explained the largest fraction of the variation in the bacterial communities in all three wells the explained variation was highest in h52 29 5 and lowest in h41 20 3 fig 3 b d and e the variation in bacterial community composition explained by the recharge events was dependent on the period and ranged from 17 6 including single term and the interaction term effects of variation in the groundwater bacterial communities in h41 to 12 2 in h52 the strong relationship between community composition and phase recharge recession can also be observed along the first pcoa axis for wells h41 fig 3a and h43 fig 3c as the samples show clear separation according to if they came from a recharge or recession phase the effect of recharge on bacterial diversity and abundance was well and period dependent recharge significantly increased bacterial diversity in h41 wilcoxon p 0 01 in p18 bacterial diversity in h41 was markedly increased by 14 by recharge recharge significantly elevated bacterial abundance in h43 wilcoxon p 0 05 by 17 in p14 and by 200 in p19 respectively supplementary table s5 however bacterial diversity was decreased by recharge by 21 in p18 in h43 supplementary table s6 bacterial diversity and abundance remained unaffected by recharge in h52 over the investigation period supplementary table s5 s6 changes in bacterial community composition also correlated with changes in water level nitrate and ammonium that fluctuated over time and explained 16 1 9 5 and 15 2 of variations in wells h41 h43 and h52 respectively supplementary figure s5 contrasting effects were observed in the wells in h41 changes in bacterial community composition were correlated with nitrate and ammonium during recharge supplementary figure s5a whereas a correlation with dissolved oxygen and nitrate was observed in h43 supplementary figure s5b in h52 changes in bacterial community composition were correlated with nitrate and correlated with ammonium during recharge supplementary figure s5c 3 4 specific bacterial taxa can be associated with recharge phases the contribution of recharge related taxa to the baseline communities i e those present during recession phases in the groundwater were well and period dependent fig 4 among the three wells bacterial communities in h43 received the highest taxa contribution from the recharge related source mean 41 0 sd 16 5 over the investigated periods followed by h41 mean 33 5 sd 23 3 and significant differences in the contribution of the recharge related taxa between periods were evident in these wells in p18 the overwhelming majority of bacteria originated from the recharge related source in both h41 mean 66 5 sd 15 1 and h43 mean 57 8 sd 15 4 the contribution of recharge related taxa was smallest in the periods between p15 and p17 when the water level change during recharge was only minor the contribution of recharge related taxa was consistently low mean 9 1 sd 4 6 over the periods in well h52 we further investigated the recharge related portions of the microbial communities to determine taxa that are likely being introduced during recharge events the taxa identified differed between the wells indicating unique community dynamics across the three wells we observed considerably more taxa across all taxonomic levels that were consistently associated with recharge events in well h41 231 compared to wells h43 and h52 56 and 73 respectively supplementary figure s8 10 well h41 had slightly more recharge favoured taxa 55 4 than recharge repressed while in wells h43 and h52 there were more recharge depressed taxa 89 3 and 54 8 respectively the taxa identified differed between the wells indicating unique community dynamics across the three wells at the genus level there were 84 discriminative taxa in well h41 of which 47 were recharge favoured fig 5 a these genera were predominantly from within the proteobacteria phylum although recharge favoured genera also included patescibacteria such as saccharimonadales and ca peribacteria overall much fewer discriminative genera were identified in wells h43 and h52 and most were recharge depressed 89 5 and 69 2 respectively nitrospira and thermodesulfovibrionia were the most recharge depressed taxa in h41 the recharge depressed genera in well h43 came from nine different phyla and included several uncharacterised or unclassified genera while most recharge depressed genera in h52 belonged to the proteobacteria phylum fig 5 4 discussion by analysing a comprehensive time series of monthly samples collected across three wells in a fractured limestone geological setting we demonstrated that the groundwater microbiome shows significant alterations these changes were in response to groundwater recharge in shallow and deeper zones of fractured bedrock aquifers revealing considerable microbial succession and evolution over the 6 year sampling period the temporal patterns we observed highlight that the subsurface can be much more dynamic than previously thought and stress the need to investigate temporal patterns not only in surface aquatic habitats but also across a range of characteristics within subsurface aquatic systems the strong cyclical patterns observed in surface aquatic microbial communities were brought to light because of the high temporal resolution and long timespans employed by the studies shade et al 2007 gilbert et al 2012 morán et al 2015 similarily expansive temporal research had been lacking for groundwater ecosystems studies conducted over shorter time scales or less frequent sampling intervals nonetheless pointed to seasonal differences in the groundwater microbiome zhou et al 2012 and fluctuations in the abundances of consistently present taxa hubalek et al 2016 zelaya et al 2019 by employing our long term high resolution sampling and analysis approach we demonstrated oscillating patterns of subsurface aquatic microbial communities however these patterns were weaker and not cyclic like what is observed in marine environments fuhrman et al 2006 shade et al 2007 2013 gilbert et al 2012 li et al 2015 morán et al 2015 ward et al 2017 wang et al 2020 for marine environments seasonal patterns are strongly linked to changes in temperature salinity and the change in day length fuhrman et al 2006 ward et al 2017 while in lakes the patterns are mainly related to thermal stratification and dissolved oxygen nitrate and nitrite concentrations shade et al 2007 many of these variables are irrelevant to a subsurface system and drivers of the variations were therefore different in our study the dissimilarity patterns of the groundwater bacterial communities through time were largely explained by recharge that predominantly occurs during the winter half year lehmann and totsche 2020 the patterns observed might be specific for shallow fractured bedrock aquifers as karstic and shallow aquifers have been demonstrated to show temporal variation farnleitner et al 2005 pronk et al 2009 understanding the drivers and community reactions resulting in patterns unique to each aquatic system will provide complementary insights into the wide range of processes shaping microbial communities across environments microbial communities in the absence of external influences are most often shifting towards a stable composition a change in this state can be brought about by changes in the conditions or a disturbance that pushes the system into a new state faust et al 2015 marine environments are a good example of a system where changes in the composition of microbial communities is driven by a change in the environmental conditions and since these environmental conditions go through similar cycles each year so do the communities seasonal patterns of marine bacterial communities are so consistent over the years that sampling month can be predicted based on bacterial community composition fuhrman et al 2006 lake bacterial communities are also largely shaped by gradually and cyclically changing environmental conditions but they are more prone to disturbances heavy rainfall can result in mixing of the otherwise stratified water column in lakes but lake microbial communities are resilient to such events returning to their pre disturbance state once the environmental parameters also recover shade et al 2012 additionally the bacterial community recovery after rainfall related disturbances can be tracked through clear phases of succession and can occur as rapidly as within two weeks of the flooding event shabarova et al 2021 these patterns are distinct to what we observed in our system where the microbial communities never returned to the same state as observed during previously time points this is likely because the temporal patterns in groundwater microbiomes are driven largely by disturbance in the form of recharge events which impose shocks on the aquifer communities we found that these successive disturbances resulted in bacterial communities that were increasingly more dissimilar to their initial state i e at the first sampling point and oscillating patterns were only apparent when comparing samples within a three year time period this suggests that both the type of disturbance as well as the system determines the microbial response in groundwater systems the disturbances directly and repetitively introduce taxa likely predominantly surface derived to a groundwater microbiome adapted to its local environmental conditions we consider the shallow subsurface an open biogeoreactor linked to the surface by water matter and energy flow küsel et al 2016 and the magnitude of the import of surface derived microbial taxa varies over space and time given its large biodiversity fierer et al 2007 soils represent a rich microbial seedbank and exported taxa will vary with each recharge event this inconsistency will affect groundwater community assembly and might explain why unlike lake ecosystems groundwater microbiomes of this study did not return to the same state after each perturbation the hainich cze groundwater microbiome dominated by cand patescibacteria proteobacteria and nitrospira is distinct from the soil microbiome in the local recharge areas herrmann et al 2019 krüger et al 2021 acidobacteria actinobacteria and planctomycetes making up approximately 40 of the soil bacterial community are either not mobilized into the seepage at all or in low abundance herrmann et al 2019 surprisingly members of cand patescibacteria already dominate seepage water at 30 cm soil depth with relative abundances of up to 50 although they represent only 0 55 of the total soil community herrmann et al 2019 indeed the cand patescibacteria uba9983 enriched in seepage compared to soil by a factor of 100 in that study was among the recharge favoured groundwater bacteria identified at well h41 in addition to other patescibacteria such as saccharimonadales and ca peribacteria and members of the proteobacteria phylum the small size of these organisms and therefore transport ease could explain why they are preferentially introduced during recharge events ultimately the mobilized taxa become part of the present groundwater microbiome and either flourish survive starve or die and end up as necromass for the survivors downhill groundwater of well h52 is not characterized by high surface connectivity and the contribution of recharge related taxa was consistently small across the periods and therefore not a dominant driver of the temporal patterns the unique characteristics of this well was also reflected in the distinct trajectory of the temporal changes in the microbiome this serves as a reminder that both dispersal and environmental selective community assembly mechanisms shape the dynamics of the three contrasting groundwater microbiomes present at the hainich cze we have previously shown that the groundwater microbiome at h52 is under stronger environmental selection pressure than those of the other two wells yan et al 2020 due to longer groundwater residence time caused by lower bulk rock permeability than midslope wells lazar et al 2019 which might explain the unique trajectory of the temporal changes in the microbiome the minor perturbation effects on the microbial community dynamics at h52 appear to be further stabilized by higher selective assembly mechanisms leading to less dissimilar communities over time indeed the response of groundwater microbial communities to changes in environmental conditions can be more important in shaping the communities than the influx of surface derived taxa fillinger et al 2021 these complex interactions may explain why wells located along the same hillslope exhibit different patterns and drivers of those patterns surface export driven by recharge events alone likely does not explain the well specific community dynamics we observed recharge events not only increase connectivity to surface soils but enable the exchange between different aquifers lehmann and totsche 2020 including the mobilization of rock attached microbes surface attached microbes can reach high densities and activities especially in sediments of porous aquifers smith et al 2018 whereas the formation of microcolonies or biofilms might be only present in thin fractures as the limestone mudstone alternations exhibit tight rock matrices only lazar et al 2019 despite the low density of endolithic microbes detected in twenty rock cores obtained from the hainich cze lazar et al 2019 rock surface attached microbes can therefore like the soil act as a microbial seedbank during recharge events the large groundwater level fluctuation observed in well h41 20 m coinciding with cross statal water flow could have resulted in greater dissemination of the microbial seedbank from the permanently saturated zone as well as from shallow uphill sources soil and aeration zone see lehmann and totsche 2020 resulting in the elevated alpha diversity we observed during recharge events resulting in the elevated alpha diversity we observed during recharge events indeed this well had the largest number of recharge associated taxa in its microbiome the large increase of alpha diversity following the pronounced water level increase in 2018 suggests a positive relationship between recharge strength and bacterial diversity in shallow aquifers with consequences for ecosystem functioning not all mobilized microbes might be able to adapt to the new environmental conditions after recharge related perturbation events only rock surfaces of the saturated zone would contribute to exchange processes with the groundwater and allow microbial dispersal as surface attached microbial communities show less temporal dynamics than the pelagic ones zhou et al 2012 they might help to restore the baseline microbial communities given that there appears to be a relationship between the temporal patterns of planktonic groundwater bacterial communities and rock attached microbes a better understanding of the temporal dynamics of these attached bacteria is crucial as the provision of clean drinking water is one of the most important ecosystem services the subsurface provides to us humans we have to study a wider range of groundwater systems including the aeration zone to truly understand the temporal dynamics of groundwater microbiomes 5 conclusions the discrete but recurring disturbances in the form or groundwater recharge are an intrinsic system property of near surface groundwater microbiomes importantly the weak oscillating patterns in community similarity at well h41 was only observed when comparing bacterial communities sampled within three years of each other after this the temporal variation between samples was too great to observe the oscillating patterns all wells showed decreased similarity to the initial state over time suggesting that community succession is occurring the patterns we observed are unique to shallow fractured rock groundwater environments and differ to what is seen in surface oceans lakes and rivers and highlight the importance of conducting high resolution temporal research across a wide variety of environments only then can we begin to achieve a complete

groundwater wells over a six year period n 230 along a hillslope recharge area we showed that the bacterial communities in the groundwater of limestone mudstone alternations were not stable over time and exhibited non linear dissimilarity patterns which corresponded to periods of groundwater recharge further we observed an increase in dissimilarity over time generalized additive model p 0 001 indicating that the successive recharge events result in communities that are increasingly more dissimilar to the initial reference time point the sampling period was able to explain up to 29 5 of the variability in bacterial community composition and the impact of recharge events on the groundwater microbiome was linked to the strength of the recharge and local environmental selection many groundwater bacteria originated from the recharge related sources mean 66 5 sd 15 1 and specific bacterial taxa were identified as being either enriched or repressed during recharge events overall similar to surface aquatic environments the microbiomes in shallow fractured rock groundwater vary through time though we revealed groundwater recharges as unique driving factors for these patterns

their effects on ecosystem processes arguably the most comprehensive temporal research of environmental microbiomes has been conducted in aquatic systems shade et al 2013 there is evidence of seasonal patterns and annual periodicity in the composition of bacterial communities in lakes shade et al 2007 2013 li et al 2015 and surface oceans fuhrman et al 2006 gilbert et al 2012 morán et al 2015 ward et al 2017 wang et al 2020 specific marine taxa show preferences to either winter or summer seasons ward et al 2017 and the diversity of the marine bacterial communities is often found to be highest in winter months gilbert et al 2012 ladau et al 2013 although this does not always hold true ward et al 2017 however planktonic bacterial communities in streams do not exhibit seasonal patterns portillo et al 2012 indicating that temporal variation might be system specific and that not all aquatic bacterial communities show seasonal response patterns unlike surface freshwater and marine systems groundwater microbiomes have been largely ignored in temporal studies subsurface waters are not driven by seasonally varying primary production due to the lack of sunlight there is little temperature variation presumably little input of surface derived fresh easily available organic carbon akob and küsel 2011 benk et al 2019 and groundwater residence time can exceed those of rivers and lakes it was therefore assumed that groundwater microbial communities would be relatively stable over time griebler and lueders 2009 however these systems appear to be less constant than first assumed and there is evidence from short term studies 1 year that groundwater microbiomes exhibit seasonal dynamics associated with changes in groundwater chemistry and recharge events lin et al 2012 zelaya et al 2019 zhou et al 2012 it is likely that surface connectivity of an aquifer rock type and porosity all impact the amount of temporal variation observed farnleitner et al 2005 pronk et al 2009 küsel et al 2016 surface near groundwater especially could harbor temporally distinct microbial communities affecting its ecosystem functioning we have previously reported that space but not time plays a significant role in shaping groundwater bacterial communities in fractured mixed carbonate siliciclastic bedrock when comparing samples collected three months apart over three years but the high spatial variations observed could have masked temporal variabilities yan et al 2020 finer and longer time scales similar to marine time series research are needed to identify potential patterns

2007 especially is likely to increase in the future in terms of both water quantity and quality hartmann et al 2014 therefore we aimed to disentangle the long term temporal changes in surface near groundwater bacterial communities and identify the drivers of the observed patterns for this study we took advantage of regular monthly sampling campaigns of groundwater from the monitoring transect of the hainich critical zone exploratory cze küsel et al 2016 in central germany the three selected monitoring wells represent contrasting depths surface connectivity and hydrochemistry we hypothesize that 1 the long observation time 6 years and high temporal resolution of our sampling will allow us to detect temporal variations within the groundwater microbiome of a fractured aquifer system 2 temporal patterns will vary between wells due to varying local conditions and environmental selection strength and 3 successive disturbances in the form of groundwater recharge events will drive the temporal variation through their impact on microbial diversity and abundance including the introduction of surface derived taxa 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site in the hainich cze a multi story

2 and we used a significance level of α 0 05 for all statistical tests all r scripts for the statistical analyses are available at https github com pikatech cyclic patterns periods of increased seasonal recharge were identified in groundwater level time series as the periods between annual minima and maxima recession periods represent falling water levels generally due to limited surface recharge in general a period here labelled as p two digit year included one recession phase and one recharge phase p13 however only consists of a recharge phase the otus with relative abundance less

median like quantile normalization method was performed using r package metagenomeseq paulson et al 2013 prior to multivariate data analysis we plotted bacterial community dissimilarity bray curtis distance against sampling time interval days for all pairwise observations from the same well and a smooth curve was added using geom smooth to illustrate the non linear relationship between sampling time difference days and community dissimilarity generalized additive models gam were used as the smoothing method the smooth terms were all significant p 0 001 for all three wells indicating clearly nonlinear effect of time on bacterial community dissimilarity to visualize dissimilarities of bacterial community composition in each groundwater well an unconstrained ordination principal coordinates analysis pcoa was performed on the relative abundance data based on bray curtis distance variation partitioning analysis was done based on a 2 factorial permanova model bray curtis distance period recharge with significance tested using the default 999 permutations canonical analysis of principal coordinates cap was performed to test the relationships between the bacterial communities and the standardized hydrochemical parameters in each well based on bray curtis distance with 999 permutations using r package vegan oksanen et al 2007 linear dependencies between constraints were investigated via the variance inflation factor vif factors with vif 10 and non significant factors based on 999 permutations were removed from the model the shannon alpha diversity index was estimated from the raw data without normalization using the r package phyloseq mcmurdie and holmes 2013 since the values of the shannon diversity and bacterial 16s rrna gene abundance estimated from quantitative pcr were not normally distributed based on shapiro wilk test of normality we used non parametric methods for hypothesis testing non parametric one factorial kruskal wallis test was used to test the difference of bacterial diversity and abundance between the three wells if there was significant difference between the wells dunn test was used for multiple comparisons using r package fsa ogle 2015 the p values for multiple comparisons were adjusted using the benjamini hochberg method benjamini and hochberg 1995 the difference in bacterial alpha diversity and abundance between the recharge and the recession phases of each period was tested using non parametric wilcoxon method to unravel the effect of recharge events on the groundwater bacterial communities in each period we performed fast expectation maximization for microbial source tracking feast shenhav et al 2019 the feast method estimates the contribution in proportion of the input source conditions to the sink communities and also reports the fraction of the unknown source contribution i e 100 the fraction of the known source contribution here we used the recharge samples as sinks and the recession samples before the corresponding recharge period as sources in each period we considered the portion of the microbial community that feast could not assign as having been there before recharge i e during the previous recession phase labelled as unknown in the analyses output as having been introduced during recharge the physical source of this portion e g surface derived aeration zone attached cannot be determined non parametric kruskal wallis tests were used to test the differences in the proportion of unknown source between the defined periods for each well if there was significant difference of the unknown source contribution between the periods dunn test was used for multiple comparisons using r package fsa ogle 2015 the p values for multiple comparisons were adjusted using the benjamini hochberg method benjamini and hochberg 1995 to determine which taxa might be considered part of the recharge sourced portion of the communities we performed linear discriminant analysis effect size lefse segata et al 2011 threshold p 0 05 lda effect size 2 here we determined the bacterial markers that discriminated bacterial communities between phases of increased recharge and recession phases at all taxonomic levels due to the high temporal difference in the bacterial community data we only aimed to discover the bacterial taxa that were associated with recharge or recession phases irrespective of the period p14 p19 class recharge subclass period our dataset did not include a recession phase in p13 for pairwise comparison between recharge and recession phases so p13 data were not considered for lefse analysis 3 results 3 1 groundwater level and quality fluctuations in the aquifers the groundwater levels in the fractured mixed carbonate siliciclastic bedrock predominantly showed seasonal patterns with highstands in spring early summer and lowstands in early winter maximum water level fluctuations at h41 reached 27 3 m followed by h52 with 19 0 m and 3 m in the shallow well h43 fig 1c figure s1 s2 s3 groundwater recharge usually occurred from october to march april with peaks owing to snowmelt during summer recessions minor rises of water levels reflect groundwater recharge events predominantly after rainstorms with extreme amounts of precipitation 99 9th percentile see lehmann and totsche 2020 we assigned six h41 and h52 or seven h43 periods consisting of a consecutive recession and recharge phase fig 1b c in the shallower groundwater well h43 typically sinusoidal temperature fluctuations occurred with a mean of 9 2 c and amplitudes of 0 4 k that were delayed by 7 months in comparison to the air temperature recharge events only caused minor variation 0 1 k mostly cooling at the same location in a depth of 48 m mean 9 2 c seasonal temperature variation was 0 3 k whereas in the discharge direction temperatures in 65 m depth mean 9 6 c fluctuated by 0 1 k both coinciding with seasonal water level fluctuation the well h41 show considerable fluctuation in ca so4 2 dissolved oxygen no3 with fluctuating water levels and inverse variation of k mg na si and nh4 contrastingly the shallow well h43 show insignificant differences between recharge and recession phases only in comparison to the deep midslope well the deep well in discharge direction h52 is supplied by nh4 during recharge phases and by no3 during recessions whereas so4 2 mg and na vary correspondingly 3 2 groundwater bacterial community composition varied over time we assessed statistically significant temporal patterns in the dissimilarity of bacterial communities in all three wells the relative abundances of the most dominant classes varied over time within each well fig 2 a c in general with increasing time between two compared samples the dissimilarity of the bacterial communities in those samples also increased in a non linear manner gam p 0 001 for all wells fig 2d f however as indicated by the wide spread of the data points underlying this trend some samples collected further apart could show greater similarity than those collected within shorter time intervals overall bacterial community dissimilarity as reflected by the median bray curtis distance values was lowest in the h52 0 56 and higher in h41 0 64 and h43 0 67 the differences in dissimilarity between the three wells were statistically significant dunn s p values 0 001 for all pairwise comparisons supplementary figure s4 within a well for samples that were collected at different times of the year bacterial communities tended to be more dissimilar to each other when sampling was separated by roughly 6 18 or 30 months while communities were more similar when sampled at the same time of the year i e 12 24 or 36 months apart although this trend was not statistically significant fig 2d f we refer to these slight increases and decreases as oscillating patterns in bacterial community dissimilarity this pattern was most clearly observed for well h41 fig 2d the smooth terms for correlations were significant p 0 001 for all three wells indicating that the relationship between time and bacterial community dissimilarity was nonlinear this weak oscillating dissimilarity pattern at h41 was no longer observed when time interval between two samples was greater than three years after 6 years the communities exhibited a dissimilarity of over 0 7 in h52 and 0 8 in h41 and h43 fig 2d f 3 3 factors relating to changes in bacterial community over time differences in groundwater bacterial community structure in all three wells was significantly related to the different periods p13 p19 and phases recharge recession period alone explained the largest fraction of the variation in the bacterial communities in all three wells the explained variation was highest in h52 29 5 and lowest in h41 20 3 fig 3 b d and e the variation in bacterial community composition explained by the recharge events was dependent on the period and ranged from 17 6 including single term and the interaction term effects of variation in the groundwater bacterial communities in h41 to 12 2 in h52 the strong relationship between community composition and phase recharge recession can also be observed along the first pcoa axis for wells h41 fig 3a and h43 fig 3c as the samples show clear separation according to if they came from a recharge or recession phase the effect of recharge on bacterial diversity and abundance was well and period dependent recharge significantly increased bacterial diversity in h41 wilcoxon p 0 01 in p18 bacterial diversity in h41 was markedly increased by 14 by recharge recharge significantly elevated bacterial abundance in h43 wilcoxon p 0 05 by 17 in p14 and by 200 in p19 respectively supplementary table s5 however bacterial diversity was decreased by recharge by 21 in p18 in h43 supplementary table s6 bacterial diversity and abundance remained unaffected by recharge in h52 over the investigation period supplementary table s5 s6 changes in bacterial community composition also correlated with changes in water level nitrate and ammonium that fluctuated over time and explained 16 1 9 5 and 15 2 of variations in wells h41 h43 and h52 respectively supplementary figure s5 contrasting effects were observed in the wells in h41 changes in bacterial community composition were correlated with nitrate and ammonium during recharge supplementary figure s5a whereas a correlation with dissolved oxygen and nitrate was observed in h43 supplementary figure s5b in h52 changes in bacterial community composition were correlated with nitrate and correlated with ammonium during recharge supplementary figure s5c 3 4 specific bacterial taxa can be associated with recharge phases the contribution of recharge related taxa to the baseline communities i e those present during recession phases in the groundwater were well and period dependent fig 4 among the three wells bacterial communities in h43 received the highest taxa contribution from the recharge related source mean 41 0 sd 16 5 over the investigated periods followed by h41 mean 33 5 sd 23 3 and significant differences in the contribution of the recharge related taxa between periods were evident in these wells in p18 the overwhelming majority of bacteria originated from the recharge related source in both h41 mean 66 5 sd 15 1 and h43 mean 57 8 sd 15 4 the contribution of recharge related taxa was smallest in the periods between p15 and p17 when the water level change during recharge was only minor the contribution of recharge related taxa was consistently low mean 9 1 sd 4 6 over the periods in well h52 we further investigated the recharge related portions of the microbial communities to determine taxa that are likely being introduced during recharge events the taxa identified differed between the wells indicating unique community dynamics across the three wells we observed considerably more taxa across all taxonomic levels that were consistently associated with recharge events in well h41 231 compared to wells h43 and h52 56 and 73 respectively supplementary figure s8 10 well h41 had slightly more recharge favoured taxa 55 4 than recharge repressed while in wells h43 and h52 there were more recharge depressed taxa 89 3 and 54 8 respectively the taxa identified differed between the wells indicating unique community dynamics across the three wells at the genus level there were 84 discriminative taxa in well h41 of which 47 were recharge favoured fig 5 a these genera were predominantly from within the proteobacteria phylum although recharge favoured genera also included patescibacteria such as saccharimonadales and ca peribacteria overall much fewer discriminative genera were identified in wells h43 and h52 and most were recharge depressed 89 5 and 69 2 respectively nitrospira and thermodesulfovibrionia were the most recharge depressed taxa in h41 the recharge depressed genera in well h43 came from nine different phyla and included several uncharacterised or unclassified genera while most recharge depressed genera in h52 belonged to the proteobacteria phylum fig 5 4 discussion by analysing a comprehensive time series of monthly samples collected across three wells in a fractured limestone geological setting we demonstrated that the groundwater microbiome shows significant alterations these changes were in response to groundwater recharge in shallow and deeper zones of fractured bedrock aquifers revealing considerable microbial succession and evolution over the 6 year sampling period the temporal patterns we observed highlight that the subsurface can be much more dynamic than previously thought and stress the need to investigate temporal patterns not only in surface aquatic habitats but also across a range of characteristics within subsurface aquatic systems the strong cyclical patterns observed in surface aquatic microbial communities were brought to light because of the high temporal resolution and long timespans employed by the studies shade et al 2007 gilbert et al 2012 morán et al 2015 similarily expansive temporal research had been lacking for groundwater ecosystems studies conducted over shorter time scales or less frequent sampling intervals nonetheless pointed to seasonal differences in the groundwater microbiome zhou et al 2012 and fluctuations in the abundances of consistently present taxa hubalek et al 2016 zelaya et al 2019 by employing our long term high resolution sampling and analysis approach we demonstrated oscillating patterns of subsurface aquatic microbial communities however these patterns were weaker and not cyclic like what is observed in marine environments fuhrman et al 2006 shade et al 2007 2013 gilbert et al 2012 li et al 2015 morán et al 2015 ward et al 2017 wang et al 2020 for marine environments seasonal patterns are strongly linked to changes in temperature salinity and the change in day length fuhrman et al 2006 ward et al 2017 while in lakes the patterns are mainly related to thermal stratification and dissolved oxygen nitrate and nitrite concentrations shade et al 2007 many of these variables are irrelevant to a subsurface system and drivers of the variations were therefore different in our study the dissimilarity patterns of the groundwater bacterial communities through time were largely explained by recharge that predominantly occurs during the winter half year lehmann and totsche 2020 the patterns observed might be specific for shallow fractured bedrock aquifers as karstic and shallow aquifers have been demonstrated to show temporal variation farnleitner et al 2005 pronk et al 2009 understanding the drivers and community reactions resulting in patterns unique to each aquatic system will provide complementary insights into the wide range of processes shaping microbial communities across environments microbial communities in the absence of external influences are most often shifting towards a stable composition a change in this state can be brought about by changes in the conditions or a disturbance that pushes the system into a new state faust et al 2015 marine environments are a good example of a system where changes in the composition of microbial communities is driven by a change in the environmental conditions and since these environmental conditions go through similar cycles each year so do the communities seasonal patterns of marine bacterial communities are so consistent over the years that sampling month can be predicted based on bacterial community composition fuhrman et al 2006 lake bacterial communities are also largely shaped by gradually and cyclically changing environmental conditions but they are more prone to disturbances heavy rainfall can result in mixing of the otherwise stratified water column in lakes but lake microbial communities are resilient to such events returning to their pre disturbance state once the environmental parameters also recover shade et al 2012 additionally the bacterial community recovery after rainfall related disturbances can be tracked through clear phases of succession and can occur as rapidly as within two weeks of the flooding event shabarova et al 2021 these patterns are distinct to what we observed in our system where the microbial communities never returned to the same state as observed during previously time points this is likely because the temporal patterns in groundwater microbiomes are driven largely by disturbance in the form of recharge events which impose shocks on the aquifer communities we found that these successive disturbances resulted in bacterial communities that were increasingly more dissimilar to their initial state i e at the first sampling point and oscillating patterns were only apparent when comparing samples within a three year time period this suggests that both the type of disturbance as well as the system determines the microbial response in groundwater systems the disturbances directly and repetitively introduce taxa likely predominantly surface derived to a groundwater microbiome adapted to its local environmental conditions we consider the shallow subsurface an open biogeoreactor linked to the surface by water matter and energy flow küsel et al 2016 and the magnitude of the import of surface derived microbial taxa varies over space and time given its large biodiversity fierer et al 2007 soils represent a rich microbial seedbank and exported taxa will vary with each recharge event this inconsistency will affect groundwater community assembly and might explain why unlike lake ecosystems groundwater microbiomes of this study did not return to the same state after each perturbation the hainich cze groundwater microbiome dominated by cand patescibacteria proteobacteria and nitrospira is distinct from the soil microbiome in the local recharge areas herrmann et al 2019 krüger et al 2021 acidobacteria actinobacteria and planctomycetes making up approximately 40 of the soil bacterial community are either not mobilized into the seepage at all or in low abundance herrmann et al 2019 surprisingly members of cand patescibacteria already dominate seepage water at 30 cm soil depth with relative abundances of up to 50 although they represent only 0 55 of the total soil community herrmann et al 2019 indeed the cand patescibacteria uba9983 enriched in seepage compared to soil by a factor of 100 in that study was among the recharge favoured groundwater bacteria identified at well h41 in addition to other patescibacteria such as saccharimonadales and ca peribacteria and members of the proteobacteria phylum the small size of these organisms and therefore transport ease could explain why they are preferentially introduced during recharge events ultimately the mobilized taxa become part of the present groundwater microbiome and either flourish survive starve or die and end up as necromass for the survivors downhill groundwater of well h52 is not characterized by high surface connectivity and the contribution of recharge related taxa was consistently small across the periods and therefore not a dominant driver of the temporal patterns the unique characteristics of this well was also reflected in the distinct trajectory of the temporal changes in the microbiome this serves as a reminder that both dispersal and environmental selective community assembly mechanisms shape the dynamics of the three contrasting groundwater microbiomes present at the hainich cze we have previously shown that the groundwater microbiome at h52 is under stronger environmental selection pressure than those of the other two wells yan et al 2020 due to longer groundwater residence time caused by lower bulk rock permeability than midslope wells lazar et al 2019 which might explain the unique trajectory of the temporal changes in the microbiome the minor perturbation effects on the microbial community dynamics at h52 appear to be further stabilized by higher selective assembly mechanisms leading to less dissimilar communities over time indeed the response of groundwater microbial communities to changes in environmental conditions can be more important in shaping the communities than the influx of surface derived taxa fillinger et al 2021 these complex interactions may explain why wells located along the same hillslope exhibit different patterns and drivers of those patterns surface export driven by recharge events alone likely does not explain the well specific community dynamics we observed recharge events not only increase connectivity to surface soils but enable the exchange between different aquifers lehmann and totsche 2020 including the mobilization of rock attached microbes surface attached microbes can reach high densities and activities especially in sediments of porous aquifers smith et al 2018 whereas the formation of microcolonies or biofilms might be only present in thin fractures as the limestone mudstone alternations exhibit tight rock matrices only lazar et al 2019 despite the low density of endolithic microbes detected in twenty rock cores obtained from the hainich cze lazar et al 2019 rock surface attached microbes can therefore like the soil act as a microbial seedbank during recharge events the large groundwater level fluctuation observed in well h41 20 m coinciding with cross statal water flow could have resulted in greater dissemination of the microbial seedbank from the permanently saturated zone as well as from shallow uphill sources soil and aeration zone see lehmann and totsche 2020 resulting in the elevated alpha diversity we observed during recharge events resulting in the elevated alpha diversity we observed during recharge events indeed this well had the largest number of recharge associated taxa in its microbiome the large increase of alpha diversity following the pronounced water level increase in 2018 suggests a positive relationship between recharge strength and bacterial diversity in shallow aquifers with consequences for ecosystem functioning not all mobilized microbes might be able to adapt to the new environmental conditions after recharge related perturbation events only rock surfaces of the saturated zone would contribute to exchange processes with the groundwater and allow microbial dispersal as surface attached microbial communities show less temporal dynamics than the pelagic ones zhou et al 2012 they might help to restore the baseline microbial communities given that there appears to be a relationship between the temporal patterns of planktonic groundwater bacterial communities and rock attached microbes a better understanding of the temporal dynamics of these attached bacteria is crucial as the provision of clean drinking water is one of the most important ecosystem services the subsurface provides to us humans we have to study a wider range of groundwater systems including the aeration zone to truly understand the temporal dynamics of groundwater microbiomes 5 conclusions the discrete but recurring disturbances in the form or groundwater recharge are an intrinsic system property of near surface groundwater microbiomes importantly the weak oscillating patterns in community similarity at well h41 was only observed when comparing bacterial communities sampled within three years of each other after this the temporal variation between samples was too great to observe the oscillating patterns all wells showed decreased similarity to the initial state over time suggesting that community succession is occurring the patterns we observed are unique to shallow fractured rock groundwater environments and differ to what is seen in surface oceans lakes and rivers and highlight the importance of conducting high resolution temporal research across a wide variety of environments only then can we begin to achieve a complete

low hydraulic retention time hrt varying from 474 to 237 min ammonium removal efficiencies of approximately 87 100 were observed with an ammonium removal rate of approximately 14 5 mg nh4 n l d partial biomass washout occurred due to the extremely low carbon and nitrogen concentrations in the feeding which could only support the growth of a small portion of bacteria but no major changes on the reactor removal performance were observed the cfgr was inoculated with activated sludge and operated for 98 days biomass granulation occurred in 7 days improving the settling properties due to a high up flow velocity of 11 m h and an applied hrt of 5 min the reactor presented mature granules after 32 days achieving an average diameter of 1 9 mm at day 63 the cfgr ammonium removal efficiencies were of approximately 10 20 with ammonium removal rates of 90 0 mg nh4 n l d the main biological processes taking place in the ags sbr were nitrification and heterotrophic growth while in the cfgr the ammonium removal occurred only by heterotrophic assimilation with the reactor also presenting complete and partial denitrification which caused nitrite production comparing both systems the cfgr achieved 6 times higher ammonium removal rates than the ags sbr being suitable for treating extremely high flows on the other hand the ags sbr removed almost 100 of ammonium content in the wastewater

to 2012 wild fish capture increased less than 10 whereas aquaculture production increased more than five times representing nowadays over 50 of the total fish produced krause et al 2015 oecd fao 2017 also it is predicted that in 2030 about 60 of the fish for consumption will be produced in aquaculture systems world bank 2013 inland freshwater aquaculture activities impose a high water demand from natural nearby water streams that in certain regions is scarce competition for this resource will increase with its increasing scarcity thus affecting the continuous development of aquaculture activity salmonids production is one of the most important freshwater aquaculture sectors in europe with rainbow trout as one of the most produced species eurostat 2018 the use of recirculating aquaculture systems ras in the rainbow trout production sector reduces freshwater usage whilst maintaining fish production pulkkinen et al 2019 2018 suhr and pedersen 2010 however the application of ras increases nutrient and organic matter concentrations in fish farms water streams nitrogen n compounds are major harmful water pollutants for fishes rainbow trout mortality increases when ammonium concentration is over 2 3 mg nh₄ n l liao and mayo 1972 nitrite is even more harmful than ammonium with concentrations ranging from 0 14 to 0 15 mg no2 n l causing approximately 50 of mortality on rainbow trout russo et al 1974 in ras adequate ammonium and nitrite removal is crucial to ensure fish health and consequently its production for this purpose emerged and submerged systems are used for the development of heterotrophic and nitrifying biofilms that remove nitrogen pollutants and suspended solids blancheton et al 2013 martins et al 2010 the most frequent biological water treatments used in ras are the rotating biological contactors rbc trickling filters tf and bed filters bf miller and libey 1985 reported ammonium removal rates arr between 9 38 and 2 40 mg nh4 n l d in rbc and tf respectively that achieved ammonium removal percentages in the range of 74 82 and 23 51 the application of a fixed and a moving bf for the treatment of a rainbow trout ras effluent achieved arrs of 92 and 231 mg nh4 n l d respectively suhr and pedersen 2010 nevertheless when the water usage is extremely high such as in intensive rainbow trout farms the resulting hrt is frequently not long enough to remove the nitrogen pollutants thus technologies able to achieve good removal performances at short hrt have a special interest in this sector aerobic granular sludge ags based technologies can be an interesting alternative to traditional biofilters used in ras in ags systems the microorganisms self immobilize forming compact aggregates with excellent settling properties and have proved resistance to a range of toxic compounds while keeping the main nutrient removal processes amorim et al 2016 ramos et al 2017 ags presents great biomass retention properties and also presents higher removal performance and lower operational costs in comparison with biological aerated filters di iaconi et al 2005 furthermore the ags morphology enables that aerobic anaerobic and anoxic layers co exist in granules due to different oxygen diffusion allowing for full carbon and nutrients removal processes to take place within a single reactor dobbeleers et al 2017 ags technology requires a building area smaller than conventional activated sludge treatments thus its application can be adequate to the needs of such farms where the land area available is limited several studies on the successful use of ags to treat low strength wastewater in terms of chemical oxygen demand cod and nitrogen between 42 231 mg cod l and 12 53 mg n l removal at laboratory scale have been reported awang et al 2017 peyong et al 2012 sguanci et al 2019 awang et al 2017 reported that by shortening the cycle length reducing the hrt the process became more stable due to the organic loading rate olr increase however the nitrogen concentrations commonly found in freshwater aquaculture wastewater are much lower 0 3 2 0 mg nh4 n l ebeling and timmons 2012 than those of these studies up to date the application of ags systems for the treatment of wastewater was mostly carried out in sequencing batch reactors sbr nevertheless continuous flow reactors cfr have certain advantages over sbr such as an easier operation and control and large scale high flow treatment capacity however their biomass retention capacity is lower than that in sbr kent et al 2018 yang et al 2014 cultivated ags in an airlift cfr achieving removal performances of 30 for total nitrogen tn and of 75 for cod and fast biomass granulation 25 days using low strength wastewater 20 45 mg nh4 n l and 100 250 mg cod l as inflow taking into account the extremely high flows of the fattening zones in freshwater aquaculture farms and the short availability of construction areas the cfr system can be an interesting compact technology to operate at very short hrt moreover we et al 2020 when revising previous research works on the treatment of low medium strength domestic wastewater via ags found that cfr are indeed an alternative to sbr but further research on the main biological removal processes and on the granulation should be elucidated to ascertain the potential of the cfrs the present research work aimed to compare the performance of two different ags based technologies sbr and cfr for the treatment of extremely low strength wastewater mimicking an aquaculture trout farm s recycling water the challenge of the study was to accumulate enough granular sludge inside the reactors with appropriate settling properties to cope with the short hydraulic residence times imposed to treat large flows to remove the nitrogen compounds and produce effluents suitable for recirculation in aquaculture farms the authors hypothesized that ags reactors will be capable to produce recycling water with enough physical chemical quality to refill fish tanks without affecting fish mortality and production 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and seeding sludge two different laboratory scale reactor configurations namely an ags sbr and a cfgr were studied for the treatment of extremely low strength freshwater aquaculture wastewater with different operational conditions the ags sbr consisted of a column type plexiglas reactor with a working volume of 2 5 l fig 1 a cycles were established using automatic timers to start and stop filling aeration and effluent withdrawal each cycle consisted of four consecutive phases i feeding and anaerobic reaction during which 0 95 l of influent media was pumped into the reactor from the bottom in a plug flow regime ii aerobic reaction in which aeration was provided through the reactor bottom at 4 l min superficial air velocity of 84 8 m h controlled by a flowmeter iii settling and iv effluent withdrawal the reactor was operated at a volume exchange ratio of 40 and a corresponding hrt as shown in table 1 the sludge retention time srt was not controlled over the operational period the ph measured online was in average 7 0 0 8 dissolved oxygen do concentration was not monitored the bioreactor was operated at room temperature 22 25 c the cfgr consisted of a 2 l methacrylate cylinder with a 3 phase gas liquid solid separator in the upper zone fig 1b the reactor was not aerated and the do concentration was that of the feeding ranging from 6 3 to 8 1 mg o2 l the feeding media pumped through the reactor bottom in a continuous mode was the mechanism to expand the biomass bed inside the reactor favoring the mixture the effluent was removed continuously from the reactor s top by liquid overflow the up flow velocity imposed by the influent up flow rate in the 3 phase separator defined the settling velocity of the biomass particles that remained in the system temperature and ph were not controlled room temperature varied from 17 to 22 c the ph value was imposed by the dilution water tap water characterized by ph ranging from 6 3 to 6 9 the ags sbr was inoculated with ags from a full scale urban wastewater nereda system frielas portugal with an initial biomass concentration of 4 8 g vss l on day 98 ags from a full scale nereda system was used to re seed the reactor which attained a biomass concentration of 1 7 g vss l and as such the adaptability of the new granules to withstand such low nutrient feeding without a prior adaptation stage was also evaluated the cfgr was inoculated with activated sludge from the secondary treatment of an urban wastewater treatment plant silvouta santiago de compostela spain with an initial biomass concentration of 2 4 g vss l the seeding sludge had a sludge volume index svi of 135 ml g tss the specific denitrifying activity of the seeding sludge was 38 1 mg n2 n g vss d and the heterotrophic activity was 78 10 mg cod g vss d the biomass did not present aerobic oxidizing bacteria aob nor nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob activities 2 2 synthetic media the recycling wastewater from an intensive freshwater aquaculture facility of grupo tres mares gtm in the northwest of spain was collected for chemical analysis the feeding media of both reactors were prepared to mimic the composition of the water recycled in the trout farm facility table 1 2 2 operational strategy the ags sbr was firstly operated with 8 treatment cycles of 180 min per day for an adaptation stage at a fixed hrt of 474 min in this phase the concentration of nutrients was gradually decreased to mimic the aquaculture recycling water for adaptation of the system biomass afterwards the experimental operation was split into two phases stage i day 0 to day 32 where the reactor was operated with 8 treatment cycles of 180 min per day at an hrt of 474 min and stage ii day 33 to day 157 where the reactor performed 16 treatment cycles of 90 min per day corresponding to an hrt of 237 min thus increasing the volume of water treated per day the adaptation stage was conducted with a feeding media which composition was described by de kreuk et al 2005 feeding media was adjusted gradually to simulate the aquaculture station s recycling wastewater using initial concentrations of ammonium phosphate and cod 3 90 mg nh₄ n l 0 18 1 81 mg po₄³ p l and 16 0 46 2 mg cod l respectively according to equipment fluctuations the operational cycles lasted 180 min and were distributed as 60 min of anaerobic feeding 112 min of aerobic reaction 3 min of settling and 5 min of effluent withdrawal at the end of this stage the reactor was able to remove 61 32 of cod and 99 1 8 51 37 of n as ammonium and nitrite respectively at the applied loads of 0 81 1 20 g cod l d and 0 031 g n l d during this stage no p removal was observed accumulation was otherwise observed throughout since ammonium levels are so important due to their toxicity to fish this compound s removal percentage was taken as a reference to decide the moment of finishing the adaptation stage and starting the experimental stages thus as ammonium removal was satisfactory during this period the adaptation was ended after 58 days afterwards for the experimental operation presented in the present study on stage i the reactor was operated with the same cycle distribution that lasted 180 min and on stage ii the cycle length was shortened to 90 min 30 min of feeding 52 min of aerobic reaction 3 min of settling and 5 min of effluent withdrawal during the first 5 days of operation the cfgr was operated in continuous mode at an hrt of 5 2 min the up flow velocity vup was 8 1 m h achieved by applying an up flow of 285 ml min of influent only allowing the biomass able to aggregate in flocks and granules to remain inside the reactor from day 5 onwards the feeding flow was progressively increased to 385 ml min hrt of 8 1 min which led to a vup of 11 02 m h the cfgr was operated in these conditions for 98 days the large volumes of water used to feed the cfgr made it necessary to prepare a concentrated media which was diluted with tap water in a ratio of 1 77 ml ml variations in the feeding media composition were caused by the seasonal variations of the dilution tap water table 1 the tap water supplied contained 2 4 mg ca2 l and 0 8 mg mg2 l both cationic species accounted for a concentration of salt of 0 19 meq l indicating soft water conditions thus the equivalent caco3 concentration was approximately 24 6 mg l therefore alkalinity was very low and consequently the ph was slightly acid dissolved oxygen concentration depended also on the tap water composition with concentrations close to saturation conditions throughout all the operational period 6 8 mg o2 l 2 4 activity batch tests to follow the cfgr biomass specific activity several batch assays were performed throughout the reactor operation the specific denitrifying activity sda was determined according to the manometric method described by buys et al 2000 in vials of 35 ml at 20 c the concentration of substrates was 50 mg no3 n l and 225 mg cod l acetate in the vials resulting in a c n ratio of 4 5 g g liquid phase batch denitrifying assays were also conducted to follow the evolution of nitrogen compounds nitrate and nitrite as described by santorio et al 2019 the overpressure inside the vials was measured with a differential pressure transducer 0 5 psi range and linearity 0 5 of full scale centerpoint electronics biogas composition was measured with a gas chromatograph hewlett packard 5890 series ii respirometric assays were performed to follow the specific aerobic heterotrophic activity hetact as well as ammonium aobact and nitrite nobact oxidizing activities lópez fiuza et al 2002 to avoid nitrifying activity during the hetact test 0 01 mmol l of allylthiourea was added all batch activity tests were conducted at 20 c in triplicate the respirometric assays were carried out using a biological 152 oxygen monitor bom ysi inc model 5300 equipped with oxygen selective probes ysi 5331 2 5 analytical methods throughout their operation influent and effluent samples of the reactors were regularly withdrawn

concentrations in the filtrate were determined with photometric test kits spectroquant merck millipore according to the manufacturer s instructions the ags bed height was measured at the end of the settling period using a graduated scale placed on the reactor s column in the cfgr operation a spectrophotometric method was applied to determine ammonium concentration bower and holm hansen 1980

low content in carbon and nutrients and extremely high flows in this context a simulated freshwater aquaculture wastewater was supplied to two different granular sludge reactors one operated in sequential mode ags sbr and the other in continuous cfgr the removal performance of both reactors was evaluated and is compared in the following sections 3 1 1 organic matter and phosphorous removal the cod and phosphate removal during the operation of each reactor were evaluated fig 2 during stages i and ii the ags sbr was fed with variable influent cod concentrations between 7 3 and 70 6 mg cod l which were mainly caused by flux variations within pumps and tubings by the end of stage i the reactor removed on average 52 8 20 3 achieving a maximum removal percentage of 86 of the fed carbon load afterwards in stage ii which lasted for 125 days an average removal percentage of 73 1 26 3 was observed reaching up to 100 of cod removal fig 2a the organic removal rate orr ranged from 44 to 334 7 mg cod l d in stage i and 55 3 to 354 2 mg cod l d in stage ii fig 2d it is worth taking note that after reinoculation on day 98 the cod removal capacity of the reactor lowered from 88 to 62 on average cod is not toxic to fish but high cod concentrations in the water translate to less dissolved oxygen available for fish which can induce hypoxia in fish leading to several health problems and mortality in the cfgr at an applied olr of 5 3 g cod l d an overall organic carbon removal efficiency of approximately 45 was obtained increasing up to 70 fig 2c this resulted in a competitive orr between 2380 3700 mg cod l d fig 2d in comparison with other heterotrophic granular systems carrera et al 2019 and almost ten times higher than the orr observed for the ags sbr the high heterotrophic activity of the biomass was confirmed by respirometric assays in fact it increased from 78 10 mg cod g vss d in the inoculum to 999 27 mg cod g vss d after 44 days of operation the heterotrophic activity of the biomass within the reactor continued to increase up to 1749 116 mg cod g vss d on day 78 despite the do concentration being close to saturation in the feeding media 8 1 9 6 mg o2 l mass balances showed that all of it was consumed to oxidize the organic matter the cod consumed codremoved was approximately 8 10 mg cod l fig 2c and the cod necessary for denitrification coddenitrification taking into account the nitrate consumed fig 4b was 0 28 0 42 mg cod l thus the difference between codremoved and coddenitrification matches with the influent dissolved oxygen concentration available for the aerobic processes the phosphorus removal was monitored regularly in the ags sbr as the imposed operational conditions in the cfgr were not established to remove this compound in the ags sbr the influent phosphate concentrations varied from 0 12 to 0 89 mg po4 3 p l throughout the operational time table 1 effluent concentrations varied from 0 26 to 0 66 mg po4 3 p l in stage i demonstrating low levels of removal on some days up to 20 5 although p accumulation was observed over most of the operational period during stage ii phosphorus removal efficiency seemed to improve with higher mean removal values from 4 1 7 8 in stage i to 46 8 30 0 and up to 100 in stage ii additionally during stage ii after the reinoculation removal efficiency lowered from 56 0 21 1 to 40 5 32 7 thus phosphate removal efficiency in stage ii varied in the range of 40 100 fig 2b in the cfgr phosphate concentration in the influent was 0 8 mg po4 3 p l and in the effluent it remained under the detection limit of the analytical method on several operational days analyzed from the concentrations in the effluent it was determined that approximately 12 of the phosphorus in the feeding was removed all phosphate consumed was probably necessary for biomass growth taking into account the cod removal observed and considering c5h7o2np0 15 as the biomass elemental composition the better phosphate removal performance in ags sbr can be attributed to the cycle distribution that comprised an anaerobic feeding period and a subsequent aerobic period in this system the phosphate can be assimilated and removed by phosphate accumulating organisms pao the continuous aerobic feeding in cfgr did not promote pao proliferation and consequently phosphorus was consumed only due to heterotrophic cellular growth although the organic matter and phosphate concentrations measured in the trout factory 21 mg cod l and 0 8 mg po4 3 l are not toxic to fish in a recycling system these concentrations will presumably tend to increase causing problems such as oxygen depletion and fish mortality thus the cod and phosphorus removal achieved by both reactors could avoid the increase of concentration of these pollutants allowing for water recycling 3 1 2 nitrogen removal and transformation the ags sbr and the cfgr performed stable in terms of nitrogen removal transformation efficiencies during 157 and 98 days respectively fed with aquaculture like synthetic media fig 3 a and 3b in the ags sbr ammonium removal was on average 98 5 3 3 during stage i slightly increasing to 98 7 3 5 in stage ii achieving up to 100 in both phases within stage ii before reinoculation the removal efficiency was reduced to 97 4 4 9 especially in the last 14 days nevertheless the reactor recovered its ammonium removal capacity of 99 8 0 3 after reinoculation in both stages the ammonium effluent concentrations 0 00 0 25 mg n l were below the toxicity limit for the fish the nrr was on average of 14 5 0 5 mg n l d fig 3c in the cfgr the ammonium concentration decreased by approximately 0 3 mg nh4 n l from the feeding media to the effluent overall the ammonium removal efficiency was low approximately 10 achieving values up to 20 fig 3b nevertheless taking into account the high applied ammonium loading rate alr of 690 800 mg nh4 n l d associated with the extremely short hrt this removal percentage led to average arr values of 90 mg nh4 n l d reaching values of up to 180 mg nh4 n l d fig 3c mass balances indicate that the carbon consumed was enough to assimilate all the ammonium removed thus all ammonium consumption during cfgr operation seemed to serve for heterotrophic growth regarding nitrate and nitrite contents the behavior observed in each reactor was different fig 4 a and 4b in the ags sbr complete nitrification with nitrate accumulation was observed throughout both stages during stage i effluent concentration of nitrite was 0 016 0 007 mg no2 n l which decreased to half 0 008 0 017 mg no2 n l during stage ii indicating that shortening the cycle length and thus the hrt might have contributed to the nitrification improvement on the other hand nitrate concentration in the effluent increased to approximately 0 5 1 0 mg no3 n l from day 1 to day 98 fig 4a it gradually decreased from day 98 onwards after reinoculation indicating the possible occurrence of denitrification in the inner layers of the granules in this period nitrate concentration in the effluent was negligible and nitrite concentration was always below toxic levels for rainbow trout 0 14 mg no2 n l probably this is a result of the addition of new granules some of which with large diameters allowing for denitrification as ammonium consumption remained constant fig 3a and was over the nitrate production this indicates that part of the ammonium was consumed for heterotrophic growth as nitrite was not produced in the cfgr nitrate concentration in the effluent decreased slightly along the whole operation with removal percentages between 3 25 fig 4b during the first 48 days the nrr ranged from 15 to 100 mg no3 n l d decreasing thereafter to 3 30 mg no3 n l d fig 4c thus denitrification took place in the cfgr due to the low do concentration achieved inside the reactor besides this result matches the c no3 n ratio of 4 mg mg that allows denitrification activity buys et al 2000 although nitrite was absent from the feeding media it was detected in the effluent 0 03 0 10 mg n l fig 4b but it always remained below the toxic level for rainbow trout the nitrite production rate npr was also higher during the first 48 operational days producing up to 26 mg no2 n l d from that moment on the npr decreased to 3 mg no2 n l d therefore once the granules matured the nitrite production decreased to below 0 05 mg no2 n l this low concentration of nitrite which was produced could be related to a combination of low oxygen diffusion in mature granules facilitating complete denitrification instead of partial denitrification and low do concentration to achieve complete ammonium oxidation throughout the reactor operation the arr and nitrate removal rate nrr fig 4c was higher than the nitrite production rate npr indicating that each process separately could account for the nitrite production to identify which of the processes was responsible for the npr batch activity experiments to determine aob nob and denitrifying activities were carried out the aob and nob activities of the cfgr biomass were measured on operational days 44 and 76 by respirometric tests in both cases no aob nor nob activities were detected showing that the cfgr biomass was not able to oxidize neither ammonium to nitrite nor nitrite to nitrate these results reinforce the hypothesis that ammonium consumption in the cfgr only served for biomass growth although the sludge used as inoculum performed the nitrification denitrification processes in the urban wastewater treatment plant its nitrifying activity was presumably not enough to be detected by the respirometric assays thus the low aob and nob activities during the operational period can be related to this fact combined with a competition for the dissolved oxygen with the heterotrophic bacteria that use it for organic matter oxidation since aob activity was not present the nitrite production could be associated with denitratation a denitrifying liquid phase test was conducted on day 75 showing a high specific denitrifying activity sda in terms of nitrate consumption of 980 53 mg no3 n g vss d fig 5 during the test nitrite transient accumulation occurred with a specific production rate of 451 16 mg no2 n g vss d therefore the biomass was enriched preferentially in microorganisms able to reduce nitrate to nitrite considering this nitrite production capacity of the biomass all the nitrate could be reduced to nitrite inside the reactor nevertheless the reactor denitratation activity was lower due to the high do concentration the high do concentrations in the influent should promote the development of aob and nob microorganisms however the absence of these processes indicated that all the oxygen was consumed by the heterotrophic bacteria avoiding nitrification the high sda of the biomass shows that the promotion of denitrifying activity by decreasing the do influent concentration could improve the nitrate removal influent concentrations and consequent cod and nutrient removal variability were observed and mainly attributed to perturbations in the plug flow feeding system at the high flows programmed different pressures were applied to the tubings forming preferential channels inducing fluctuations in the volumes and thus concentrations of the mixture of media and water 3 2 biomass properties in the ags sbr mature granules collected from a full scale reactor were used as inoculum whereas in cfgr the formation of granules from flocculant activated sludge using extremely low strength wastewater and an extremely short hrt was evaluated in ags sbr during stage i the biomass bed height inside the reactor progressively decreased from 17 0 to 10 5 cm accompanied by a concomitant increase of the tss content in the effluent fig 6 the biomass gradual washout was probably due to biomass starvation caused by the low influent organic matter and nutrients concentrations even with the hrt reduction in stage ii by shortening the cycle length to apply 16 treatment cycles per day the biomass bed height continued to decrease some authors reported that shortening the length of the operational cycles improves the performance of ags for the treatment of low strength wastewater de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2006 liu et al 2007 as in stage ii the applied olr and nlr doubled it was expected that the biomass starvation would diminish avoiding biomass washout nevertheless the granular biomass has difficulties adapting to the aquaculture conditions even after the reinoculation with mature granules on day 98 the biomass bed height started to decrease from 15 to 4 cm until day 123 after this day onwards the biomass bed height remained stable till the end of the operation day 157 indicating that the biomass concentration was almost constant during this period and may have adapted to these conditions the extremely low carbon and nitrogen content present in the feeding exerted a metabolic selective pressure probably only supporting the viability of a small portion of biomass leading to a reduction in the biomass concentration inside the reactor fig 6 along with partial disaggregation of the granules nevertheless the reactor removal performance remained stable over the operation even after changing the hrt moreover with the biomass reinoculation on day 98 stage ii ammonium removal increased up to 100 remaining stable thereafter although the biomass bed height reduction again occurred that did not affect the processes removal efficiencies since the new granules faced aquaculture conditions properly to start up an ags reactor to treat aquaculture wastewater without a previous adaptation period of the inoculated granular sludge seems feasible the maintenance of biomass properties ammonium and organic matter removal performance after applying low strength wastewater to mature granules cultivated at high strength conditions was already reported by other authors liu et al 2007 peyong et al 2012 the appearance of the ags granules was followed by visual observation throughout the reactor s operation since the main focus of the ags sbr s study was removal performance granules appearance and size were not registered nevertheless at seeding granules appeared smooth round large circa 2 4 mm and dark brown grey and throughout operation gradually turned light brown to yellowish small 2 mm with irregular shapes dense and with fast settleability less than 3 min which was the applied settling time in the sbr similar granules features have been reported in other studies using low to medium strength wastewater which have described smaller granules than those obtained in high strength wastewaters ni et al 2009 we et al 2020 in the cfgr the granulation process took place by applying high liquid up flow velocities vup to the reactor inoculated with activated sludge the vup was increased gradually from 8 1 to 11 0 m h during the first four days of operation consequently the sludge bed expanded favoring substrate mass transfer while the flocks with less density were washed out in the effluent as a result the biomass aggregated forming granules that started to appear on day 7 showing that this strategy promoted a fast granulation the initial granules were almost translucid with a jelly like appearance fig 7 a afterwards the development of new biomass in the granule body as a dense core was observed on day 32 fig 7 since the reactor was not mechanically aerated this result showed that the hydraulic forces the high up flow velocity imposed by a short hrt and the reactor s design were crucial to promote the rapid biomass aggregation this result proved that it is possible to obtain mature granules facing extremely low strength concentrations with this configuration when mature granules were accumulated inside the cfgr their particle diameter and density were measured the granule average diameter was 1 9 mm with a density of 7 12 g vss lgranule moreover the measured svi30 was 312 ml g tss on day 78 which is below the svi30 of the seeding sludge and matches the low density values of the granules additionally svi1 was 321 ml g tss which means a ratio of 0 97 svi30 svi1 indicating a fast settling velocity only a few studies performed the treatment of low strength wastewater with ags in a continuous flow reactor at laboratory scale yang et al 2014 zhou et al 2012 however they did not treat such extremely low pollutant concentrations as the present study approximately 20 70 mg n l and 50 250 mg cod l the fast granulation achieved in the cfgr fits the granulation times reported in those studies 20 25 days however the granule diameter achieved by those authors was between 0 6 0 9 mm and in the case of cfgr particle size was larger besides those studies reported low svi30 of approximately 38 40 ml g tss typical of ags reactors when external aeration was supplied to the system in fact yang et al 2014 reported a high svi 225 ml g tss when the oxygen availability was limited in certain operational periods therefore the lack of dissolved oxygen can be the cause for the particular structure of the granules in the continuous flow reactor which involves a high svi nevertheless despite the high svi value the settling properties of the granules were good enough to keep the biomass inside the cfgr even with the extremely high vup applied 3 3 ags continuous versus sequential operation nitrogen species present in the water are especially harmful to fish with ammonium and nitrite and their unionized forms the most dangerous compounds ammonium removal or transformation into less harmful compounds is mandatory to allow water recirculation inside a trout farm in the present study the operation of both granular reactors sequential and continuous was evaluated using as feed a synthetic medium with a composition mimicking the recirculating aquaculture water the removal performances were different due to the different origin of the seeding sludge used in each reactor and the operational strategies imposed while the ammonium removal was close to 100 in the ags sbr only 10 20 of removal was achieved in the cfgr however the arr was 90 0 mg nh4 n l d in the cfgr compared to the 14 5 mg nh4 n l d in the ags sbr these differences were mainly caused by the feeding strategy adopted and consequently the hrt the shorter hrt of the cfgr did not allow for the development of nitrifying bacteria and the ammonium was consumed only by cellular assimilation however nitrification occurred in ags sbr after reinoculation denitrification also occured phosphorous removal followed a similar behavior as ammonium in cfgr only 6 12 was consumed mostly for cellular growth while in the ags sbr the phosphate removal was 40 100 attributed to pao activity comparing the ammonium removal performances achieved in cfgr and ags sbr 10 20 in front of 100 the air insufflation in cfgr could have improved nitrification since oxygen was limited and probably mostly consumed by heterotrophic bacteria nevertheless it is important to highlight that the major cfgr operational cost is the feed pumping which is already necessary for aquaculture farms to maintain the water circulation of the ras thus the operational costs related to aeration would increase due to electric consumption besides the aeration could reduce biomass retention performance operating at this extremely low hrt even with the 3 phase separator rotating biological contactors rbc trickling filters tf and bed filters are frequently used in ras suhr and pedersen 2010 studied a fixed bed biofilter and a moving bed biofilter treating the effluent of a rainbow trout ras and reported arrs of 92 and 231 mg nh4 n l d respectively miller and libey 1985 reported arr between 9 38 and 2 40 mg nh4 n l d in rbc and tf respectively the ammonium removal percentages in rbc were in the range of 74 82 and of 23 51 in tf thus the ags sbr achieved ammonium removal rates higher than those reported for tf and rbc while cfgr achieved similar values to those of a fixed bed biofilter even though the arr of the moving bed biofilter reported by suhr and pedersen 2010 was higher than that of the cfgr the hrt was also longer 20 85 min as the moving bed biofilter treated smaller water flows it will require a larger implantation area than the cfgr in addition among all the referred treatment technologies the ags sbr provided the highest effluent chemical quality apart from saving freshwater capture the implementation of ras in trout aquaculture farms is important in mediterranean countries which suffer from water shortage especially in the summer period the dry season lasts about 3 4 months and in this period the available volume of water in the nearby freshwater sources rivers or lakes diminishes limiting the fish production of the plants thus this is the period when trout farms in such conditions recycle the water therefore operation lengths of 98 and 157 days in the case of the cfgr and the ags sbr respectively could be long enough to understand if reactors performances fulfill the fish plant necessities both systems demonstrated a fast biomass adaptation to the imposed operational conditions the cfgr produced granules from activated sludge in only 7 days in ags sbr after a reinoculation day 98 the biomass concentration took approximately 3 weeks to stabilize some biomass loss occurred due to the extremely low carbon and nutrients concentrations without functional performance compromise of the remaining nitrite concentration is a crucial issue in trout farming and although the cfgr produced an effluent with a higher nitrite concentration than the ags sbr it was mostly below the toxic limit for the fishes therefore the ags sbr produced an effluent with good physico chemical quality adequate for recirculation in the trout tanks while the cfgr was able to treat larger flows which is also essential in freshwater aquaculture farming overall both reactors configurations could be suitable for the treatment of extremely low strength freshwater aquaculture streams aiming at their recycling the ags sbr provides a discharge stream with ammonium and nitrite concentrations close to zero this high quality effluent is necessary in the areas of the trout plants where the spawn and the first stages of the fish growth fingerlings take place thurston et al 1981 it is important to highlight that the water flow demand for this part of the farms is much lower than for the fattening tanks moreover the adult trouts of the fattening tanks are more resistant to nitrogen pollutants than fingerlings thus the cfgr could better suit the larger water flow necessities of this area of the farm the cfgr can recycle a water flow 35 times higher with an arr 6 12 times higher than the capacity of ags sbr besides for most of the operational period of the cfgr the produced effluent s nitrite concentrations were below the levels which are toxic to fish despite the lower removal capacity the ammonium concentration was reduced around 0 2 0 3 mg n l in the effluent tahar et al 2018 monitored the ammonium concentration profile of a flow through rainbow trout farm showing an average increase of 0 13 mg n l between the inlet and the outlet therefore the estimated ammonium production of a trout farm could be removed by the cfgr avoiding ammonium concentration increase in the recycled water thus while the ags sbr could provide high quality effluent without ammonium and nitrite content to face the fingerling area requirements the cfgr could fulfill the extremely high water flow necessities of the fattening area with suficient quality to ensure trout health consequently both configurations could be suitable for different areas of freshwater aquaculture closed farms 4 conclusions adaptation of the mature granular biomass in the ags sbr was not required to accomplish the removal of carbon and nitrogen compounds from the aquaculture mimicked effluent the formation of granular biomass was feasible in 7 days by applying large liquid up flow velocities to a cfgr the achieved nitrogen removal efficiencies in both granular systems depended on the hrt and nlr applied in the ags sbr the main processes taking place were nitrification and heterotrophic growth ammonium removal was near to 100 resulting in an ammonium removal rate of 14 5 mg nh4 n l d for ags sbr in the cfgr the processes occuring preferentially were heterotrophic growth and denitratation in this bioreactor unit 10 20 of the ammonium was consumed for biomass growth reaching loads of 90 0 mg nh4 n l d at laboratory scale both granular biomass systems sequential and continuous produced effluents with nitrogen concentrations below the toxic levels for fish in both cases the chemical quality of the produced water is appropriate as recycling flow in the aquaculture farm the ags sbr produced an effluent with negligible nitrogen compounds concentrations which could be suitable for recycling in the fingerling area as fingerlings are extremely sensitive to nitrogen forms the cfgr produced an effluent with moderate chemical quality but compatible with recycling water quality needed for the fish fattening area and was able to treat larger flows besides it achieved a fast granulation 7 days showing a rapid adaptation to freshwater aquaculture conditions nevertheless pilot scale tests in a real freshwater aquaculture environment will help to ascertain the stability and viability of both granular reactors in treating these water streams declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

16851,ammonium and nitrite levels in water are crucial for fish health preservation and growth maintenance in freshwater aquaculture farms limiting water recirculation the aim of the present work was the evaluation and comparison of two granular sludge reactors which were operated to treat freshwater aquaculture streams at laboratory scale an aerobic granular sludge sequencing batch reactor ags sbr and a continuous flow granular reactor cfgr both units were fed with a synthetic medium mimicking an aquaculture recycling water 1 9 2 9 mg n l with low carbon content and operational temperature varied between 17 and 25 c the ags sbr inoculated with mature granules from a full scale wastewater treatment plant achieved high carbon and ammonium removal during the 157 operational days even at low hydraulic retention time hrt varying from 474 to 237 min ammonium removal efficiencies of approximately 87 100 were observed with an ammonium removal rate of approximately 14 5 mg nh4 n l d partial biomass washout occurred due to the extremely low carbon and nitrogen concentrations in the feeding which could only support the growth of a small portion of bacteria but no major changes on the reactor removal performance were observed the cfgr was inoculated with activated sludge and operated for 98 days biomass granulation occurred in 7 days improving the settling properties due to a high up flow velocity of 11 m h and an applied hrt of 5 min the reactor presented mature granules after 32 days achieving an average diameter of 1 9 mm at day 63 the cfgr ammonium removal efficiencies were of approximately 10 20 with ammonium removal rates of 90 0 mg nh4 n l d the main biological processes taking place in the ags sbr were nitrification and heterotrophic growth while in the cfgr the ammonium removal occurred only by heterotrophic assimilation with the reactor also presenting complete and partial denitrification which caused nitrite production comparing both systems the cfgr achieved 6 times higher ammonium removal rates than the ags sbr being suitable for treating extremely high flows on the other hand the ags sbr removed almost 100 of ammonium content in the wastewater

to 2012 wild fish capture increased less than 10 whereas aquaculture production increased more than five times representing nowadays over 50 of the total fish produced krause et al 2015 oecd fao 2017 also it is predicted that in 2030 about 60 of the fish for consumption will be produced in aquaculture systems world bank 2013 inland freshwater aquaculture activities impose a high water demand from natural nearby water streams that in certain regions is scarce competition for this resource will increase with its increasing scarcity thus affecting the continuous development of aquaculture activity salmonids production is one of the most important freshwater aquaculture sectors in europe with rainbow trout as one of the most produced species eurostat 2018 the use of recirculating aquaculture systems ras in the rainbow trout production sector reduces freshwater usage whilst maintaining fish production pulkkinen et al 2019 2018 suhr and pedersen 2010 however the application of ras increases nutrient and organic matter concentrations in fish farms water streams nitrogen n compounds are major harmful water pollutants for fishes rainbow trout mortality increases when ammonium concentration is over 2 3 mg nh₄ n l liao and mayo 1972 nitrite is even more harmful than ammonium with concentrations ranging from 0 14 to 0 15 mg no2 n l causing approximately 50 of mortality on rainbow trout russo et al 1974 in ras adequate ammonium and nitrite removal is crucial to ensure fish health and consequently its production for this purpose emerged and submerged systems are used for the development of heterotrophic and nitrifying biofilms that remove nitrogen pollutants and suspended solids blancheton et al 2013 martins et al 2010 the most frequent biological water treatments used in ras are the rotating biological contactors rbc trickling filters tf and bed filters bf miller and libey 1985 reported ammonium removal rates arr between 9 38 and 2 40 mg nh4 n l d in rbc and tf respectively that achieved ammonium removal percentages in the range of 74 82 and 23 51 the application of a fixed and a moving bf for the treatment of a rainbow trout ras effluent achieved arrs of 92 and 231 mg nh4 n l d respectively suhr and pedersen 2010 nevertheless when the water usage is extremely high such as in intensive rainbow trout farms the resulting hrt is frequently not long enough to remove the nitrogen pollutants thus technologies able to achieve good removal performances at short hrt have a special interest in this sector aerobic granular sludge ags based technologies can be an interesting alternative to traditional biofilters used in ras in ags systems the microorganisms self immobilize forming compact aggregates with excellent settling properties and have proved resistance to a range of toxic compounds while keeping the main nutrient removal processes amorim et al 2016 ramos et al 2017 ags presents great biomass retention properties and also presents higher removal performance and lower operational costs in comparison with biological aerated filters di iaconi et al 2005 furthermore the ags morphology enables that aerobic anaerobic and anoxic layers co exist in granules due to different oxygen diffusion allowing for full carbon and nutrients removal processes to take place within a single reactor dobbeleers et al 2017 ags technology requires a building area smaller than conventional activated sludge treatments thus its application can be adequate to the needs of such farms where the land area available is limited several studies on the successful use of ags to treat low strength wastewater in terms of chemical oxygen demand cod and nitrogen between 42 231 mg cod l and 12 53 mg n l removal at laboratory scale have been reported awang et al 2017 peyong et al 2012 sguanci et al 2019 awang et al 2017 reported that by shortening the cycle length reducing the hrt the process became more stable due to the organic loading rate olr increase however the nitrogen concentrations commonly found in freshwater aquaculture wastewater are much lower 0 3 2 0 mg nh4 n l ebeling and timmons 2012 than those of these studies up to date the application of ags systems for the treatment of wastewater was mostly carried out in sequencing batch reactors sbr nevertheless continuous flow reactors cfr have certain advantages over sbr such as an easier operation and control and large scale high flow treatment capacity however their biomass retention capacity is lower than that in sbr kent et al 2018 yang et al 2014 cultivated ags in an airlift cfr achieving removal performances of 30 for total nitrogen tn and of 75 for cod and fast biomass granulation 25 days using low strength wastewater 20 45 mg nh4 n l and 100 250 mg cod l as inflow taking into account the extremely high flows of the fattening zones in freshwater aquaculture farms and the short availability of construction areas the cfr system can be an interesting compact technology to operate at very short hrt moreover we et al 2020 when revising previous research works on the treatment of low medium strength domestic wastewater via ags found that cfr are indeed an alternative to sbr but further research on the main biological removal processes and on the granulation should be elucidated to ascertain the potential of the cfrs the present research work aimed to compare the performance of two different ags based technologies sbr and cfr for the treatment of extremely low strength wastewater mimicking an aquaculture trout farm s recycling water the challenge of the study was to accumulate enough granular sludge inside the reactors with appropriate settling properties to cope with the short hydraulic residence times imposed to treat large flows to remove the nitrogen compounds and produce effluents suitable for recirculation in aquaculture farms the authors hypothesized that ags reactors will be capable to produce recycling water with enough physical chemical quality to refill fish tanks without affecting fish mortality and production 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and seeding sludge two different laboratory scale reactor configurations namely an ags sbr and a cfgr were studied for the treatment of extremely low strength freshwater aquaculture wastewater with different operational conditions the ags sbr consisted of a column type plexiglas reactor with a working volume of 2 5 l fig 1 a cycles were established using automatic timers to start and stop filling aeration and effluent withdrawal each cycle consisted of four consecutive phases i feeding and anaerobic reaction during which 0 95 l of influent media was pumped into the reactor from the bottom in a plug flow regime ii aerobic reaction in which aeration was provided through the reactor bottom at 4 l min superficial air velocity of 84 8 m h controlled by a flowmeter iii settling and iv effluent withdrawal the reactor was operated at a volume exchange ratio of 40 and a corresponding hrt as shown in table 1 the sludge retention time srt was not controlled over the operational period the ph measured online was in average 7 0 0 8 dissolved oxygen do concentration was not monitored the bioreactor was operated at room temperature 22 25 c the cfgr consisted of a 2 l methacrylate cylinder with a 3 phase gas liquid solid separator in the upper zone fig 1b the reactor was not aerated and the do concentration was that of the feeding ranging from 6 3 to 8 1 mg o2 l the feeding media pumped through the reactor bottom in a continuous mode was the mechanism to expand the biomass bed inside the reactor favoring the mixture the effluent was removed continuously from the reactor s top by liquid overflow the up flow velocity imposed by the influent up flow rate in the 3 phase separator defined the settling velocity of the biomass particles that remained in the system temperature and ph were not controlled room temperature varied from 17 to 22 c the ph value was imposed by the dilution water tap water characterized by ph ranging from 6 3 to 6 9 the ags sbr was inoculated with ags from a full scale urban wastewater nereda system frielas portugal with an initial biomass concentration of 4 8 g vss l on day 98 ags from a full scale nereda system was used to re seed the reactor which attained a biomass concentration of 1 7 g vss l and as such the adaptability of the new granules to withstand such low nutrient feeding without a prior adaptation stage was also evaluated the cfgr was inoculated with activated sludge from the secondary treatment of an urban wastewater treatment plant silvouta santiago de compostela spain with an initial biomass concentration of 2 4 g vss l the seeding sludge had a sludge volume index svi of 135 ml g tss the specific denitrifying activity of the seeding sludge was 38 1 mg n2 n g vss d and the heterotrophic activity was 78 10 mg cod g vss d the biomass did not present aerobic oxidizing bacteria aob nor nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob activities 2 2 synthetic media the recycling wastewater from an intensive freshwater aquaculture facility of grupo tres mares gtm in the northwest of spain was collected for chemical analysis the feeding media of both reactors were prepared to mimic the composition of the water recycled in the trout farm facility table 1 2 2 operational strategy the ags sbr was firstly operated with 8 treatment cycles of 180 min per day for an adaptation stage at a fixed hrt of 474 min in this phase the concentration of nutrients was gradually decreased to mimic the aquaculture recycling water for adaptation of the system biomass afterwards the experimental operation was split into two phases stage i day 0 to day 32 where the reactor was operated with 8 treatment cycles of 180 min per day at an hrt of 474 min and stage ii day 33 to day 157 where the reactor performed 16 treatment cycles of 90 min per day corresponding to an hrt of 237 min thus increasing the volume of water treated per day the adaptation stage was conducted with a feeding media which composition was described by de kreuk et al 2005 feeding media was adjusted gradually to simulate the aquaculture station s recycling wastewater using initial concentrations of ammonium phosphate and cod 3 90 mg nh₄ n l 0 18 1 81 mg po₄³ p l and 16 0 46 2 mg cod l respectively according to equipment fluctuations the operational cycles lasted 180 min and were distributed as 60 min of anaerobic feeding 112 min of aerobic reaction 3 min of settling and 5 min of effluent withdrawal at the end of this stage the reactor was able to remove 61 32 of cod and 99 1 8 51 37 of n as ammonium and nitrite respectively at the applied loads of 0 81 1 20 g cod l d and 0 031 g n l d during this stage no p removal was observed accumulation was otherwise observed throughout since ammonium levels are so important due to their toxicity to fish this compound s removal percentage was taken as a reference to decide the moment of finishing the adaptation stage and starting the experimental stages thus as ammonium removal was satisfactory during this period the adaptation was ended after 58 days afterwards for the experimental operation presented in the present study on stage i the reactor was operated with the same cycle distribution that lasted 180 min and on stage ii the cycle length was shortened to 90 min 30 min of feeding 52 min of aerobic reaction 3 min of settling and 5 min of effluent withdrawal during the first 5 days of operation the cfgr was operated in continuous mode at an hrt of 5 2 min the up flow velocity vup was 8 1 m h achieved by applying an up flow of 285 ml min of influent only allowing the biomass able to aggregate in flocks and granules to remain inside the reactor from day 5 onwards the feeding flow was progressively increased to 385 ml min hrt of 8 1 min which led to a vup of 11 02 m h the cfgr was operated in these conditions for 98 days the large volumes of water used to feed the cfgr made it necessary to prepare a concentrated media which was diluted with tap water in a ratio of 1 77 ml ml variations in the feeding media composition were caused by the seasonal variations of the dilution tap water table 1 the tap water supplied contained 2 4 mg ca2 l and 0 8 mg mg2 l both cationic species accounted for a concentration of salt of 0 19 meq l indicating soft water conditions thus the equivalent caco3 concentration was approximately 24 6 mg l therefore alkalinity was very low and consequently the ph was slightly acid dissolved oxygen concentration depended also on the tap water composition with concentrations close to saturation conditions throughout all the operational period 6 8 mg o2 l 2 4 activity batch tests to follow the cfgr biomass specific activity several batch assays were performed throughout the reactor operation the specific denitrifying activity sda was determined according to the manometric method described by buys et al 2000 in vials of 35 ml at 20 c the concentration of substrates was 50 mg no3 n l and 225 mg cod l acetate in the vials resulting in a c n ratio of 4 5 g g liquid phase batch denitrifying assays were also conducted to follow the evolution of nitrogen compounds nitrate and nitrite as described by santorio et al 2019 the overpressure inside the vials was measured with a differential pressure transducer 0 5 psi range and linearity 0 5 of full scale centerpoint electronics biogas composition was measured with a gas chromatograph hewlett packard 5890 series ii respirometric assays were performed to follow the specific aerobic heterotrophic activity hetact as well as ammonium aobact and nitrite nobact oxidizing activities lópez fiuza et al 2002 to avoid nitrifying activity during the hetact test 0 01 mmol l of allylthiourea was added all batch activity tests were conducted at 20 c in triplicate the respirometric assays were carried out using a biological 152 oxygen monitor bom ysi inc model 5300 equipped with oxygen selective probes ysi 5331 2 5 analytical methods throughout their operation influent and effluent samples of the reactors were regularly withdrawn and filtered through membrane filters 0 45 mm pore size to remove biomass chemical oxygen demand cod total suspended solids tss volatile suspended solids vss and sludge volume index svi were determined according to standard methods apha 2005 the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss concentrations were measured as tss and vss respectively the granule density was determined as the mass of the granule per granule volume applying the blue dextran method beun et al 2002 in the ags sbr operation phosphate ammonium nitrate and nitrite concentrations in the filtrate were determined with photometric test kits spectroquant merck millipore according to the manufacturer s instructions the ags bed height was measured at the end of the settling period using a graduated scale placed on the reactor s column in the cfgr operation a spectrophotometric method was applied to determine ammonium concentration bower and holm hansen 1980

low content in carbon and nutrients and extremely high flows in this context a simulated freshwater aquaculture wastewater was supplied to two different granular sludge reactors one operated in sequential mode ags sbr and the other in continuous cfgr the removal performance of both reactors was evaluated and is compared in the following sections 3 1 1 organic matter and phosphorous removal the cod and phosphate removal during the operation of each reactor were evaluated fig 2 during stages i and ii the ags sbr was fed with variable influent cod concentrations between 7 3 and 70 6 mg cod l which were mainly caused by flux variations within pumps and tubings by the end of stage i the reactor removed on average 52 8 20 3 achieving a maximum removal percentage of 86 of the fed carbon load afterwards in stage ii which lasted for 125 days an average removal percentage of 73 1 26 3 was observed reaching up to 100 of cod removal fig 2a the organic removal rate orr ranged from 44 to 334 7 mg cod l d in stage i and 55 3 to 354 2 mg cod l d in stage ii fig 2d it is worth taking note that after reinoculation on day 98 the cod removal capacity of the reactor lowered from 88 to 62 on average cod is not toxic to fish but high cod concentrations in the water translate to less dissolved oxygen available for fish which can induce hypoxia in fish leading to several health problems and mortality in the cfgr at an applied olr of 5 3 g cod l d an overall organic carbon removal efficiency of approximately 45 was obtained increasing up to 70 fig 2c this resulted in a competitive orr between 2380 3700 mg cod l d fig 2d in comparison with other heterotrophic granular systems carrera et al 2019 and almost ten times higher than the orr observed for the ags sbr the high heterotrophic activity of the biomass was confirmed by respirometric assays in fact it increased from 78 10 mg cod g vss d in the inoculum to 999 27 mg cod g vss d after 44 days of operation the heterotrophic activity of the biomass within the reactor continued to increase up to 1749 116 mg cod g vss d on day 78 despite the do concentration being close to saturation in the feeding media 8 1 9 6 mg o2 l mass balances showed that all of it was consumed to oxidize the organic matter the cod consumed codremoved was approximately 8 10 mg cod l fig 2c and the cod necessary for denitrification coddenitrification taking into account the nitrate consumed fig 4b was 0 28 0 42 mg cod l thus the difference between codremoved and coddenitrification matches with the influent dissolved oxygen concentration available for the aerobic processes the phosphorus removal was monitored regularly in the ags sbr as the imposed operational conditions in the cfgr were not established to remove this compound in the ags sbr the influent phosphate concentrations varied from 0 12 to 0 89 mg po4 3 p l throughout the operational time table 1 effluent concentrations varied from 0 26 to 0 66 mg po4 3 p l in stage i demonstrating low levels of removal on some days up to 20 5 although p accumulation was observed over most of the operational period during stage ii phosphorus removal efficiency seemed to improve with higher mean removal values from 4 1 7 8 in stage i to 46 8 30 0 and up to 100 in stage ii additionally during stage ii after the reinoculation removal efficiency lowered from 56 0 21 1 to 40 5 32 7 thus phosphate removal efficiency in stage ii varied in the range of 40 100 fig 2b in the cfgr phosphate concentration in the influent was 0 8 mg po4 3 p l and in the effluent it remained under the detection limit of the analytical method on several operational days analyzed from the concentrations in the effluent it was determined that approximately 12 of the phosphorus in the feeding was removed all phosphate consumed was probably necessary for biomass growth taking into account the cod removal observed and considering c5h7o2np0 15 as the biomass elemental composition the better phosphate removal performance in ags sbr can be attributed to the cycle distribution that comprised an anaerobic feeding period and a subsequent aerobic period in this system the phosphate can be assimilated and removed by phosphate accumulating organisms pao the continuous aerobic feeding in cfgr did not promote pao proliferation and consequently phosphorus was consumed only due to heterotrophic cellular growth although the organic matter and phosphate concentrations measured in the trout factory 21 mg cod l and 0 8 mg po4 3 l are not toxic to fish in a recycling system these concentrations will presumably tend to increase causing problems such as oxygen depletion and fish mortality thus the cod and phosphorus removal achieved by both reactors could avoid the increase of concentration of these pollutants allowing for water recycling 3 1 2 nitrogen removal and transformation the ags sbr and the cfgr performed stable in terms of nitrogen removal transformation efficiencies during 157 and 98 days respectively fed with aquaculture like synthetic media fig 3 a and 3b in the ags sbr ammonium removal was on average 98 5 3 3 during stage i slightly increasing to 98 7 3 5 in stage ii achieving up to 100 in both phases within stage ii before reinoculation the removal efficiency was reduced to 97 4 4 9 especially in the last 14 days nevertheless the reactor recovered its ammonium removal capacity of 99 8 0 3 after reinoculation in both stages the ammonium effluent concentrations 0 00 0 25 mg n l were below the toxicity limit for the fish the nrr was on average of 14 5 0 5 mg n l d fig 3c in the cfgr the ammonium concentration decreased by approximately 0 3 mg nh4 n l from the feeding media to the effluent overall the ammonium removal efficiency was low approximately 10 achieving values up to 20 fig 3b nevertheless taking into account the high applied ammonium loading rate alr of 690 800 mg nh4 n l d associated with the extremely short hrt this removal percentage led to average arr values of 90 mg nh4 n l d reaching values of up to 180 mg nh4 n l d fig 3c mass balances indicate that the carbon consumed was enough to assimilate all the ammonium removed thus all ammonium consumption during cfgr operation seemed to serve for heterotrophic growth regarding nitrate and nitrite contents the behavior observed in each reactor was different fig 4 a and 4b in the ags sbr complete nitrification with nitrate accumulation was observed throughout both stages during stage i effluent concentration of nitrite was 0 016 0 007 mg no2 n l which decreased to half 0 008 0 017 mg no2 n l during stage ii indicating that shortening the cycle length and thus the hrt might have contributed to the nitrification improvement on the other hand nitrate concentration in the effluent increased to approximately 0 5 1 0 mg no3 n l from day 1 to day 98 fig 4a it gradually decreased from day 98 onwards after reinoculation indicating the possible occurrence of denitrification in the inner layers of the granules in this period nitrate concentration in the effluent was negligible and nitrite concentration was always below toxic levels for rainbow trout 0 14 mg no2 n l probably this is a result of the addition of new granules some of which with large diameters allowing for denitrification as ammonium consumption remained constant fig 3a and was over the nitrate production this indicates that part of the ammonium was consumed for heterotrophic growth as nitrite was not produced in the cfgr nitrate concentration in the effluent decreased slightly along the whole operation with removal percentages between 3 25 fig 4b during the first 48 days the nrr ranged from 15 to 100 mg no3 n l d decreasing thereafter to 3 30 mg no3 n l d fig 4c thus denitrification took place in the cfgr due to the low do concentration achieved inside the reactor besides this result matches the c no3 n ratio of 4 mg mg that allows denitrification activity buys et al 2000 although nitrite was absent from the feeding media it was detected in the effluent 0 03 0 10 mg n l fig 4b but it always remained below the toxic level for rainbow trout the nitrite production rate npr was also higher during the first 48 operational days producing up to 26 mg no2 n l d from that moment on the npr decreased to 3 mg no2 n l d therefore once the granules matured the nitrite production decreased to below 0 05 mg no2 n l this low concentration of nitrite which was produced could be related to a combination of low oxygen diffusion in mature granules facilitating complete denitrification instead of partial denitrification and low do concentration to achieve complete ammonium oxidation throughout the reactor operation the arr and nitrate removal rate nrr fig 4c was higher than the nitrite production rate npr indicating that each process separately could account for the nitrite production to identify which of the processes was responsible for the npr batch activity experiments to determine aob nob and denitrifying activities were carried out the aob and nob activities of the cfgr biomass were measured on operational days 44 and 76 by respirometric tests in both cases no aob nor nob activities were detected showing that the cfgr biomass was not able to oxidize neither ammonium to nitrite nor nitrite to nitrate these results reinforce the hypothesis that ammonium consumption in the cfgr only served for biomass growth although the sludge used as inoculum performed the nitrification denitrification processes in the urban wastewater treatment plant its nitrifying activity was presumably not enough to be detected by the respirometric assays thus the low aob and nob activities during the operational period can be related to this fact combined with a competition for the dissolved oxygen with the heterotrophic bacteria that use it for organic matter oxidation since aob activity was not present the nitrite production could be associated with denitratation a denitrifying liquid phase test was conducted on day 75 showing a high specific denitrifying activity sda in terms of nitrate consumption of 980 53 mg no3 n g vss d fig 5 during the test nitrite transient accumulation occurred with a specific production rate of 451 16 mg no2 n g vss d therefore the biomass was enriched preferentially in microorganisms able to reduce nitrate to nitrite considering this nitrite production capacity of the biomass all the nitrate could be reduced to nitrite inside the reactor nevertheless the reactor denitratation activity was lower due to the high do concentration the high do concentrations in the influent should promote the development of aob and nob microorganisms however the absence of these processes indicated that all the oxygen was consumed by the heterotrophic bacteria avoiding nitrification the high sda of the biomass shows that the promotion of denitrifying activity by decreasing the do influent concentration could improve the nitrate removal influent concentrations and consequent cod and nutrient removal variability were observed and mainly attributed to perturbations in the plug flow feeding system at the high flows programmed different pressures were applied to the tubings forming preferential channels inducing fluctuations in the volumes and thus concentrations of the mixture of media and water 3 2 biomass properties in the ags sbr mature granules collected from a full scale reactor were used as inoculum whereas in cfgr the formation of granules from flocculant activated sludge using extremely low strength wastewater and an extremely short hrt was evaluated in ags sbr during stage i the biomass bed height inside the reactor progressively decreased from 17 0 to 10 5 cm accompanied by a concomitant increase of the tss content in the effluent fig 6 the biomass gradual washout was probably due to biomass starvation caused by the low influent organic matter and nutrients concentrations even with the hrt reduction in stage ii by shortening the cycle length to apply 16 treatment cycles per day the biomass bed height continued to decrease some authors reported that shortening the length of the operational cycles improves the performance of ags for the treatment of low strength wastewater de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2006 liu et al 2007 as in stage ii the applied olr and nlr doubled it was expected that the biomass starvation would diminish avoiding biomass washout nevertheless the granular biomass has difficulties adapting to the aquaculture conditions even after the reinoculation with mature granules on day 98 the biomass bed height started to decrease from 15 to 4 cm until day 123 after this day onwards the biomass bed height remained stable till the end of the operation day 157 indicating that the biomass concentration was almost constant during this period and may have adapted to these conditions the extremely low carbon and nitrogen content present in the feeding exerted a metabolic selective pressure probably only supporting the viability of a small portion of biomass leading to a reduction in the biomass concentration inside the reactor fig 6 along with partial disaggregation of the granules nevertheless the reactor removal performance remained stable over the operation even after changing the hrt moreover with the biomass reinoculation on day 98 stage ii ammonium removal increased up to 100 remaining stable thereafter although the biomass bed height reduction again occurred that did not affect the processes removal efficiencies since the new granules faced aquaculture conditions properly to start up an ags reactor to treat aquaculture wastewater without a previous adaptation period of the inoculated granular sludge seems feasible the maintenance of biomass properties ammonium and organic matter removal performance after applying low strength wastewater to mature granules cultivated at high strength conditions was already reported by other authors liu et al 2007 peyong et al 2012 the appearance of the ags granules was followed by visual observation throughout the reactor s operation since the main focus of the ags sbr s study was removal performance granules appearance and size were not registered nevertheless at seeding granules appeared smooth round large circa 2 4 mm and dark brown grey and throughout operation gradually turned light brown to yellowish small 2 mm with irregular shapes dense and with fast settleability less than 3 min which was the applied settling time in the sbr similar granules features have been reported in other studies using low to medium strength wastewater which have described smaller granules than those obtained in high strength wastewaters ni et al 2009 we et al 2020 in the cfgr the granulation process took place by applying high liquid up flow velocities vup to the reactor inoculated with activated sludge the vup was increased gradually from 8 1 to 11 0 m h during the first four days of operation consequently the sludge bed expanded favoring substrate mass transfer while the flocks with less density were washed out in the effluent as a result the biomass aggregated forming granules that started to appear on day 7 showing that this strategy promoted a fast granulation the initial granules were almost translucid with a jelly like appearance fig 7 a afterwards the development of new biomass in the granule body as a dense core was observed on day 32 fig 7 since the reactor was not mechanically aerated this result showed that the hydraulic forces the high up flow velocity imposed by a short hrt and the reactor s design were crucial to promote the rapid biomass aggregation this result proved that it is possible to obtain mature granules facing extremely low strength concentrations with this configuration when mature granules were accumulated inside the cfgr their particle diameter and density were measured the granule average diameter was 1 9 mm with a density of 7 12 g vss lgranule moreover the measured svi30 was 312 ml g tss on day 78 which is below the svi30 of the seeding sludge and matches the low density values of the granules additionally svi1 was 321 ml g tss which means a ratio of 0 97 svi30 svi1 indicating a fast settling velocity only a few studies performed the treatment of low strength wastewater with ags in a continuous flow reactor at laboratory scale yang et al 2014 zhou et al 2012 however they did not treat such extremely low pollutant concentrations as the present study approximately 20 70 mg n l and 50 250 mg cod l the fast granulation achieved in the cfgr fits the granulation times reported in those studies 20 25 days however the granule diameter achieved by those authors was between 0 6 0 9 mm and in the case of cfgr particle size was larger besides those studies reported low svi30 of approximately 38 40 ml g tss typical of ags reactors when external aeration was supplied to the system in fact yang et al 2014 reported a high svi 225 ml g tss when the oxygen availability was limited in certain operational periods therefore the lack of dissolved oxygen can be the cause for the particular structure of the granules in the continuous flow reactor which involves a high svi nevertheless despite the high svi value the settling properties of the granules were good enough to keep the biomass inside the cfgr even with the extremely high vup applied 3 3 ags continuous versus sequential operation nitrogen species present in the water are especially harmful to fish with ammonium and nitrite and their unionized forms the most dangerous compounds ammonium removal or transformation into less harmful compounds is mandatory to allow water recirculation inside a trout farm in the present study the operation of both granular reactors sequential and continuous was evaluated using as feed a synthetic medium with a composition mimicking the recirculating aquaculture water the removal performances were different due to the different origin of the seeding sludge used in each reactor and the operational strategies imposed while the ammonium removal was close to 100 in the ags sbr only 10 20 of removal was achieved in the cfgr however the arr was 90 0 mg nh4 n l d in the cfgr compared to the 14 5 mg nh4 n l d in the ags sbr these differences were mainly caused by the feeding strategy adopted and consequently the hrt the shorter hrt of the cfgr did not allow for the development of nitrifying bacteria and the ammonium was consumed only by cellular assimilation however nitrification occurred in ags sbr after reinoculation denitrification also occured phosphorous removal followed a similar behavior as ammonium in cfgr only 6 12 was consumed mostly for cellular growth while in the ags sbr the phosphate removal was 40 100 attributed to pao activity comparing the ammonium removal performances achieved in cfgr and ags sbr 10 20 in front of 100 the air insufflation in cfgr could have improved nitrification since oxygen was limited and probably mostly consumed by heterotrophic bacteria nevertheless it is important to highlight that the major cfgr operational cost is the feed pumping which is already necessary for aquaculture farms to maintain the water circulation of the ras thus the operational costs related to aeration would increase due to electric consumption besides the aeration could reduce biomass retention performance operating at this extremely low hrt even with the 3 phase separator rotating biological contactors rbc trickling filters tf and bed filters are frequently used in ras suhr and pedersen 2010 studied a fixed bed biofilter and a moving bed biofilter treating the effluent of a rainbow trout ras and reported arrs of 92 and 231 mg nh4 n l d respectively miller and libey 1985 reported arr between 9 38 and 2 40 mg nh4 n l d in rbc and tf respectively the ammonium removal percentages in rbc were in the range of 74 82 and of 23 51 in tf thus the ags sbr achieved ammonium removal rates higher than those reported for tf and rbc while cfgr achieved similar values to those of a fixed bed biofilter even though the arr of the moving bed biofilter reported by suhr and pedersen 2010 was higher than that of the cfgr the hrt was also longer 20 85 min as the moving bed biofilter treated smaller water flows it will require a larger implantation area than the cfgr in addition among all the referred treatment technologies the ags sbr provided the highest effluent chemical quality apart from saving freshwater capture the implementation of ras in trout aquaculture farms is important in mediterranean countries which suffer from water shortage especially in the summer period the dry season lasts about 3 4 months and in this period the available volume of water in the nearby freshwater sources rivers or lakes diminishes limiting the fish production of the plants thus this is the period when trout farms in such conditions recycle the water therefore operation lengths of 98 and 157 days in the case of the cfgr and the ags sbr respectively could be long enough to understand if reactors performances fulfill the fish plant necessities both systems demonstrated a fast biomass adaptation to the imposed operational conditions the cfgr produced granules from activated sludge in only 7 days in ags sbr after a reinoculation day 98 the biomass concentration took approximately 3 weeks to stabilize some biomass loss occurred due to the extremely low carbon and nutrients concentrations without functional performance compromise of the remaining nitrite concentration is a crucial issue in trout farming and although the cfgr produced an effluent with a higher nitrite concentration than the ags sbr it was mostly below the toxic limit for the fishes therefore the ags sbr produced an effluent with good physico chemical quality adequate for recirculation in the trout tanks while the cfgr was able to treat larger flows which is also essential in freshwater aquaculture farming overall both reactors configurations could be suitable for the treatment of extremely low strength freshwater aquaculture streams aiming at their recycling the ags sbr provides a discharge stream with ammonium and nitrite concentrations close to zero this high quality effluent is necessary in the areas of the trout plants where the spawn and the first stages of the fish growth fingerlings take place thurston et al 1981 it is important to highlight that the water flow demand for this part of the farms is much lower than for the fattening tanks moreover the adult trouts of the fattening tanks are more resistant to nitrogen pollutants than fingerlings thus the cfgr could better suit the larger water flow necessities of this area of the farm the cfgr can recycle a water flow 35 times higher with an arr 6 12 times higher than the capacity of ags sbr besides for most of the operational period of the cfgr the produced effluent s nitrite concentrations were below the levels which are toxic to fish despite the lower removal capacity the ammonium concentration was reduced around 0 2 0 3 mg n l in the effluent tahar et al 2018 monitored the ammonium concentration profile of a flow through rainbow trout farm showing an average increase of 0 13 mg n l between the inlet and the outlet therefore the estimated ammonium production of a trout farm could be removed by the cfgr avoiding ammonium concentration increase in the recycled water thus while the ags sbr could provide high quality effluent without ammonium and nitrite content to face the fingerling area requirements the cfgr could fulfill the extremely high water flow necessities of the fattening area with suficient quality to ensure trout health consequently both configurations could be suitable for different areas of freshwater aquaculture closed farms 4 conclusions adaptation of the mature granular biomass in the ags sbr was not required to accomplish the removal of carbon and nitrogen compounds from the aquaculture mimicked effluent the formation of granular biomass was feasible in 7 days by applying large liquid up flow velocities to a cfgr the achieved nitrogen removal efficiencies in both granular systems depended on the hrt and nlr applied in the ags sbr the main processes taking place were nitrification and heterotrophic growth ammonium removal was near to 100 resulting in an ammonium removal rate of 14 5 mg nh4 n l d for ags sbr in the cfgr the processes occuring preferentially were heterotrophic growth and denitratation in this bioreactor unit 10 20 of the ammonium was consumed for biomass growth reaching loads of 90 0 mg nh4 n l d at laboratory scale both granular biomass systems sequential and continuous produced effluents with nitrogen concentrations below the toxic levels for fish in both cases the chemical quality of the produced water is appropriate as recycling flow in the aquaculture farm the ags sbr produced an effluent with negligible nitrogen compounds concentrations which could be suitable for recycling in the fingerling area as fingerlings are extremely sensitive to nitrogen forms the cfgr produced an effluent with moderate chemical quality but compatible with recycling water quality needed for the fish fattening area and was able to treat larger flows besides it achieved a fast granulation 7 days showing a rapid adaptation to freshwater aquaculture conditions nevertheless pilot scale tests in a real freshwater aquaculture environment will help to ascertain the stability and viability of both granular reactors in treating these water streams declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

16852,extracellular polymeric substances eps are important components of activated sludge whose content and composition have important effects on the macro physical properties of sludge in this study the response of eps in sludge to temperature 40 200 c was systematically investigated using xad resin fractionation variable temperature infrared spectra vtis and two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos the relationships between the molecular structure of eps and the macro physical properties rheological property and dewatering performance of waste activated sludge was at varying temperature were also established during the freezing treatment the solubilization of biopolymers and destruction of the hydrophilic functional groups hydroxy amino and carboxyl resulted in the production of small organic matters which enhanced eps hydrophobicity and reduced electrostatic repulsion of sludge and subsequent dewaterability improvement for the hydrothermal treatment the eps transformation showed a two stages reaction including stage i 70 120 c and stage ii 120 c stage i 70 120 c a plenty of hydrophilic functional groups hydroxy amino and carboxyl in eps were exposed via the solubilization of biopolymers which enhanced electrostatic repulsion of sludge and eps hydrophilicity and subsequence in deterioration of sludge dewaterability and fluidity however at stage ii 120 c the high temperature caused hydrolyzation of macromolecular organic matters in completely in which the secondary structure of the protein was destroyed causing the peptide chain to unfold in addition the reduction of α helix and β sheet content and intensified maillard reaction decreased electrostatic repulsion of sludge thus resulted in the improvement of sludge dewaterability and fluidity this study enriched the theoretical basis of the optimal control of sludge treatment based on temperature regulation keywords extracellular polymeric substances waste activated sludge macro physical properties variable temperature infrared spectroscopy freezing treatment hydrothermal treatment 1 introduction waste activated sludge was is a major product of waste water treatment plants more than 60 million tons of sludge with moisture content of 80 were produced annually in china yin et al 2018 wu et al 2020 was generally contains over 90wt of water the dewatering process is of engineering practical importance in reducing water content and volume for sludge subsequent transportation and safe disposal usually chemical additions e g acid ferric and such etc and mechanical dewatering techniques press filter were united for thickened sludge conditioning however the cost of above dewatering processes represents a significant of the total operation cost in typical municipal wastewater treatment plants mwtps zhao et al 2015 and also failing to meet the increasingly stringent criteria of subsequent sludge disposal in addition extracellular polymeric substances eps are in the form of gel like structure in which highly bound to water molecules tan et al 2015 yuan et al 2014 and account for 60 80 of the biomass of activated sludge have important effects on the surface charge floc stability and macro physical properties liu et al 2019a zhang et al 2019 further reducing intracellular bound water from eps still remains a challenge thus numerous processes including coagulation flocculation chemical oxidation zhang et al 2015 wang et al 2009 ultrasonic pretreatment bien and wolny 1997 hydrothermal treatment guan et al 2012 and freezing treatment gao 2011 have been supplemented to regulate eps structures and improve the mechanical dewatering performance of sludge among these strategies sludge conditioning processes based on temperature regulation hydrothermal treatment and freezing treatment are highly effective in enhancing sludge dewatering performance during sludge freezing process the growth of ice crystals can continuously exclude and compress floc and other particles destroy cells release organic matters and intracellular bound water resulting in sludge dewaterability enhancement gao et al 2006 gao 2011 for example hu et al 2011 found that freeze thaw treatment promoted the release of organic matters in sludge in the curing stage gao 2011 claimed that the combination of alkalization and freezing treatment could promote the release of organic matter and ammonia nitrogen sun et al 2018 showed that adding nitrite prior to freezing process can promote the release of low molecular weight proteins and polysaccharides similarly hydrothermal treatment can improve the hydrolysis of organic matter via solubilization of cells in sludge releasing bound water trapped in biopolymers bougrier et al 2008 wang and li 2015 in addition hydrothermal treatment is also used as a pretreatment of anaerobic digestion to improve the stability of the organic matter and biogas production during anaerobic digestion however previous studies regarding the freezing and hydrothermal treatments especially thermal hydrolysis technology always focus on the sludge dewatering enhancement or biogas production efficiency the eps transformation and its influential mechanisms on the macro physical properties dewaterability and rheological behavior of sludge during freezing and hydrothermal treatments still lack systematic investigation variable temperature infrared spectra vtis can continuously and momentarily observe variations of functional group characteristics and record the infrared spectrum of samples at varying temperatures low temperature vtis is commonly used to study the vitrification transition of polymer materials and high temperature vtis is usually used to examine the structural properties of various materials and the thermodynamic parameters in chemical reactions at varying temperatures for example zhang et al 2000 studied the relationship between the dehydrating and recrystallization behaviors of titanate crystals by vtis and tian et al 2012 used variable temperature infrared analysis to study the conformational transformation of soybean proteins with the change in temperature delgado and arean 2011 used vtis to study the adsorption thermodynamic of various gasses concerning h beta zeolites and obtained the adsorption enthalpy and entropy therefore vtis is a powerful tool to study the physical changes and chemical processes of substances such as the phase transition intermolecular forces chemical reactions etc in addition previous studies have proved the interaction between protein and humic like components in natural organic matters nom using infrared and fluorescence quenching guan et al 2018 wang et al 2015 the interactions of organic compounds in sludge do not only affect the eps properties but they also affect the macro physical properties of sludge the vtis might be the potential technique to get insights of eps transformation at varying temperature and elucidate influential mechanism of temperature on the sludge dewaterability the main objectives of this work are to 1 investigate the effect of different temperatures 40 200 c on the macroscopic properties of sludge fluidity and dewaterability 2 unravel the influential mechanism of temperature on eps hydrophilicity and its components transformation using vtis and 2d cos methods 3 establish the relationship between molecular structure of eps and macroscopic physical properties under sludge treatment based on temperature regulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the waste activated sludge was was collected from the beixiao river sewage treatment plant located in beijing the sludge characteristics are given in table 1 all the chemical reagents used in this study are of an analytical grade and purchased from sinopharm chemical reagents co ltd in china in addition the experimental water was deionized water 2 2 experimental methods 2 2 1 eps extraction in this study eps was extracted by cation exchange resin cer technique dowex marathon c 20 50 mesh sodium form fluka 91 973 frølund et al 1996 specifically was was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min and the pellets were washed twice by 100 mmol l nacl solution cer was added to the re suspended sludge pellets with the dosage of 60 g g total suspended solids tss and the mixture was stirred for 12 h at 200 rpm and 4 c then the mixture was re centrifugated at 10 000 rpm for 10 min and the eps fraction was collected after filtrating through 0 45 μm acetate cellulose membranes and the content of corresponding organic matter in eps was shown in table s1 2 2 2 sludge and eps treatment through temperature regulation 200 ml of was were added into two 500 ml polyethylene terephthalate plastic bottles and they were sealed at 40 and 20 c for 2 h for the freezing treatment as for the hydrothermal treatment the was was poured into a 200 ml lined vessel of teflonlined ethylene teflonlined vessel sealed in a high pressure reaction kettle and then transferred to a blast oven to be heated for 2 h at 80 200 c eps was treated as the same way to investigate the properties of eps after freezing treatment and hydrothermal treatment 2 2 3 preparation of the mixed simulants the simulant preparation was based on the protein and humic acid content in the eps and the ha amount was appropriately increased the ha 20 mg l and bovine serum albumin bsa 1000 mg l solutions were mixed and stirred at 150 rpm for 1 h prior to freeze drying to obtain solid samples for the vtis analysis 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 macro physical properties of sludge 2 3 1 1 sludge dewaterability assessment details for specific resistance to filtration srf and capillary suction time cst measurements are provided in si text 1 2 3 1 2 test and simulation of the sludge rheology the sludge rheology was tested on a rheometer physica mcr302 rheometer anton paar austria with the temperature maintained at 25 c by peltier control a pp50 plate sensor with a 49 94 mm diameter and 2 0 mm gap was used flow curves of sludge samples were obtained using a control shear rate model and the rheological test was measured in the logarithmic growth phase at an increased shear rate from 0 01 to 600 s 1 the flow curves were obtained by plotting the shear stress against the shear rate the rheological models used to fit the flow curve was provided in si text 2 2 3 2 variable temperature infrared spectroscopy vtis analysis a fourier transform infrared spectrometer thermo fisher nicolet is50 with the in situ reaction cell and the associated temperature control accessory harrick were used to measure the variable temperature infrared measurement of eps bsa and the mixed simulant the test temperature ranges were 100 0 c and 20 200 c every 10 c residence 10 min and the analysis range was 650 4000cm 1 2 3 3 characterization of sludge floc properties the sludge samples were freeze dried under vacuum for 72 h and scanning electron microscope sem images were measured using a field emission scanning electron microscopy zeiss gemini300 german a zetasizer nano zs90 was used to measure the zeta potential of sludge before and after treatment 2 3 4 analysis of organic substances in sludge the organic content in sludge supernatant before and after treatment was analyzed using total organic carbon toc analyzer shimadzu japan more detailed information regarding the organic transformation was obtained by xps escalab 250xi boyue china proteins were measured using the lowry method using bsa as the standard whereas polysaccharides were measured using the anthrone sulfuric acid method using glucose as the standard molecular weight mw was determined by a waters liquid chromatography system that consisted of a waters 2487 dual l absorbance detector waters 1525 pump system a shodex kw 802 5 gel chromatography column shoko japan was used for organic materials separation 2 3 5 hydrophobic hydrophilic characteristics analysis of eps eps after freezing treatment and hydrothermal treatment was fractionated using amberlite xad 4 xad 8 resins the hydrophobic fractions were the compounds which were absorbed on xad 4 and xad 8 resins and the hydrophilic fractions was the compounds not retained on either resin wei et al 2020 additionally the hydrophobicity of eps was also analyzed by the binding ability with hydrophobic chromophore bromophenol blue chelh et al 2006 2 3 6 statistical methods the fitting of the rheological data was completed by originpro 2018 the reconstructed data matrix was then progressed using the 2d shige software kwansei gakuin university japan statistical analysis was carried out using the spss statistics version 21 0 spss chicago il usa 3 results and analysis 3 1 variation of the macroscopic physical properties of sludge with temperature 3 1 1 changes in the sludge dewatering performance with temperature batch experiments were performed to compare the sludge dewatering performance at varying temperature from figs 1a and s1 the cst and srf were significantly decreased with freezing treatment after being treated at 20 c the cst of sludge reduced from 6 02 s l g to 0 98 s l g and the srf decreased from 2 31 1014 m kg to 9 86 1013 m kg demonstrating that sludge dewaterability was significantly improved in the hydrothermal treatment srf and cst increased before 120 c and reached the maximum of 2 82 1015 m kg 1 and 183 29 s l g respectively and then reduced 3 1 2 change in the sludge rheological properties with temperature the rheological properties can provide information about fluid microstructure as shown in fig 1 b the slope of flow curves of all test samples with increasing shear stress and shear rate was illustrated and the viscosity is defined as the ratio of shear stress to shear rate which can be evaluated by means of the flow curve eshtiaghi et al 2013 all sludge samples had yield stress which indicates the existence of interactive forces between the sludge flocs when the shear stress was sufficient to break the binding force between the flocs the flow resistance decreased and the flocs began to flow the flow curves of all the samples had the basic characteristics of the yielding pseudoplastic fluid and the slope of the curves decreased with the increase of shear rate hershel bulkley h b pseudoplastic and newton models were used to fit the sludge flow curve respectively the calculated parameters of each model are given in table s2 the flow curves of all sludge samples were best fitted to the h b model r2 0 994 where n flow index reflects the strength of the sludge floc and k consistency index reflects the viscosity of the fluid also the sludge consistency index k decreased after the freezing treatment while it firstly increased and then decreased with increasing in temperature under hydrothermal treatment the rheological properties can provide information about fluid microstructure the existence of biopolymer network structure deteriorated the sludge fluidity and it also affected the dewatering performance in constant pressure conditions stickland 2015 therefore the same patterns of changes in sludge dewaterability and fluidity were observed this result suggests that the change of flocs structure and the transformation of biopolymers played the leading role in the physical properties of sludge 3 2 change in sludge floc properties with temperature fig s2 presented that the zeta potential of the sludge decreased from 34 1 mv to 45 3 mv as the temperature increased from 25 c to 120 c then it increased to 14 1 mv by raising temperature to 200 c on the other hand after the freezing treatment at 40 c the zeta potential of the sludge increased to 21 8 mv this is might because the growing ice crystals could force sludge particles to merge together and grow into larger particles which disrupted the eps structure and reduced the electrostatic interactions between the sludge flocs the decreased negative charges on floc surface led to the decreased of electrostatic interactions between the sludge flocs resulting the stabilization and flocculation of sludge which contributes to the dewatering improvement cao et al 2021 the result indicated that both freezing and hydrothermal treatments affected the negative charges on the floc surface and subsequent the interaction between sludge flocs which may result in the change of sludge dewaterability and flowability the sludge floc morphologies after being treated under different temperatures were observed through fe sem from fig s3 sludge treated at 40 c was broken and more denser flocs were formed and consolidated morphology compared to raw sludge fig s3 the irreversible destruction of cells and flocs reduced the flowing of sludge resistance although there were no obvious changes after the mild 80 c hydrothermal treatment the sludge flocs surface became loose with some irregular filamentous bacteria after treated under 100 120 c under this condition the release of hydrophilic organics led to deterioration of sludge dewatering performance however when the temperature was increased to 160 c the filaments almost disappeared and the surface of sludge floc tended to become rough and porous with the further increase in temperature 180 c the floc structure was completely destroyed into small fragments the destroyed of the network structure at high hydrothermal treatment led to a decrease in the shearing resistance of sludge particles resulting in the enhancement of flow capacity and dewaterability of sludge meanwhile the srf and cst decreased from the maximum of 2 82 1015 m kg 1 and 183 29 s l g at 120 c to 1 88 1014 m kg 1 and 1 088 s l g at 180 c the viscosity of sludge dropped sharply after hydrothermal treated at 180 c and the flow curve of sludge sample was close to newtonian fluid properties 3 3 changes in the sludge organic matter with temperature to examine the biopolymers transformation under different temperature treatments organics of supernatant in treated sludge were quantified as shown in fig 2 a by comparison dissolved organic matters doms in sludge treated by both freezing and hydrothermal methods were significantly increased and the hydrothermal treatment led to a more significant release of biopolymers compared to the freezing treatment gao 2011 proved that the amount released of the organic matter after 24 h of sludge freezing was close to that after 30 min of hydrothermal treatment at 103 c in addition hu et al 2011 found that the release of organics mainly occurred in the curing stage freezing more than 3 h and little amount of organic matter was released in the freezing stage fig 2b shows the content of proteins and polysaccharides in supernatant of sludge increased after freezing and hydrothermal treatments the polysaccharides increased significantly from 80 c to 140 c and it reached a maximum at 160 c then decreased with the further increase of temperature the maillard reactions at higher temperatures may have resulted in polysaccharide consumption zhang et al 2020 the mw distributions and contents of organic matters in supernatant of sludge after the freezing and hydrothermal treatments was presented in fig 2c and fig s4 the relative quantity of high mw organic matters 5 kda increased after freezing treatment at 20 c while decreased after freezing treatment at 40 c these results indicated that freezing treatment caused the decomposition of high mw organic matters and released more mid mw organic matters 5 kda into sludge bulk solution the mild hydrothermal treatment 80 100 c caused release of low mw organic matters 1 kda then more mid mw and high mw biopolymers were solubilized with the increase of temperature during ht treatment under 120 c the ionization of functional groups including carboxyl hydroxyl and phosphate groups on eps during hydrolysis stage increased the negative charges of floc surfaces xu et al 2018 yuan et al 2011 resulting in enhanced sludge electrostatic repulsion and subsequent dewaterability deterioration however when temperature was higher than 120 c the biopolymers in sludge were gradually hydrolyzed into smaller molecules and they lost the electric double layer of the gel like structure for example wang et al 2021 found that the biopolymer in the liquid phase could form a gel like network structure and led to the deteriorated of dewaterability which indicated that network structure formed by high mw organic matters had better water retention capacity as the temperature of hydrothermal treatment increased the intensification of high mw biopolymers hydrolysis reactions led to the destruction of gel like network structure and release of bound water to understand the organic matter transformation in sludge the n1s xps measurement was further applied on polymer samples of treated sludge as depicted in fig s5 there was no obvious changes upon n containing components in eps after the freezing treatment indicated that the protein structure remained relatively stable however the peak area of the protein n in sludge gradually decreased with the increase of temperature during hydrothermal treatment when the temperature was increased to 160 c protein n content significantly decreased while pyrrole n began to appear and continuously increased with further increase in temperature as a result the moisture of sludge cake was decreased 3 4 polarity distribution of eps with temperature as shown in fig 3 a the content of hydrophobic fraction was increased after freezing treatment at 20 c demonstrating freezing treatment caused enhancement of eps hydrophobicity after freezing treatment at 40 c the content of hydrophilic fraction increased slightly this is likely because that freezing treatment caused decomposition of eps and produced some hydrophilic biopolymers additionally the hydrophobicity of eps evaluated by the bpb method showed that more bpb was bound to eps after freezing treatment fig 3b this observation indicates freezing treatment induces the exposure of more hydrophobic functional groups of eps the increased hydrophilic fraction of eps after hydrothermal treatment at 80 c and 100 c illustrated that hydrophilic small molecular organic matters were produced due to solubilization of eps in hydrothermal process which weakened the hydrophobic interaction between eps and bpb with further increase in temperature from 120 c to 200 c the hydrophobic interaction between eps and bpb was enhanced and the hydrophilic fraction was reduced 3 5 response of eps to temperature variation to get insights of temperature effects on the functional groups of eps during the freezing and hydrothermal treatments the eps were extracted and analysed by vtis technique the infrared spectra wavelength range of 650 4000 cm 1 of eps during the freezing 100 c 0 c and hydrothermal 20 c 200 c treatments were illustrated in figs 4 and 5 respectively the functional groups of eps can be divided into hydrocarbons amides groups in proteins polysaccharides and nucleic acids and the assignments of these peaks were displayed in table s3 in the infrared spectrum of eps subjected to the freezing treatment with the decrease in temperature the absorbance of the characteristic peak near 3400 cm 1 constantly increased and the characteristic peak at 2367 cm 1 gradually appeared illustrating that freezing treatment affected the stretching of the oh in the hydroxy therefore it can be confirmed that the environment of organic matter changed significantly around 60 c tompa et al 2009 found that the hydration layer of protein began to freeze at 53 c and the protein molecules underwent dynamic transformation when the temperature decreased to 60 c as depicted in fig 4c the characteristic peak of the amide i bands in eps were sharpened and they became more intensive in the freezing process indicating that the secondary structure of protein was greatly altered these suggested that the stretching and vibration of the hydrophilic functional groups in eps were gradually enhanced with the decreasing temperature which made these groups vulnerable to be damaged during freezing thaw treatment therefore after freezing treatment the eps hydrophobicity was increased and some smaller molecular organic matters was released meanwhile the absorbance of the wide characteristic peak near 1100 cm 1 was decreased under freezing which was due to the destruction of functional groups of polysaccharides nucleic acids with the decreasing temperature in the high temperature vtis of eps fig 5b the amide ii and amide iii bands showed more distinct variations compared to amide i band which might be related to the strength of hydrogen bonds between molecules the vibration of the amide i band mainly comes from the co stretching vibration casal and mantsch 1984 mennucci and martinez 2005 and the vibrations of amide ii and amide iii bands mainly comes from nh stretching and cn bending barth 2007 thus the amide ii and amide iii bands are more sensitive to temperature compared to amide i band the characteristic peak of the amide ii band 1540 cm 1 was resolved at high temperature and it shifted to two sides barth 2007 suggested that there are coupling effects between adjacent peptide bonds in the amide ii and amide iii bands which affects the vibration and displacement of these groups in the infrared test the amide ii band and the original equilibrium state between the groups were destroyed under high temperature condition and the split characteristic peak generated a displacement also a part of the characteristic peak was shifted to the high frequency band by the action of the amide i band and the other part was shifted to the low frequency band the high temperature vtis of the amide i band secondary structure is shown in fig 5c and there are four categories of amide i band including β sheet 1630 1640 cm1 random coil 1640 1650 cm 1 α helix 1650 1660 cm 1 and β turn 1680 1690 cm 1 the characteristic peaks corresponding to the α helix β sheet and random coil decreased with the increase in temperature which indicates that the high temperature destroyed the secondary structure of the protein causing the peptide chain to unfold the decrease in the α helix content leads to the enhancement of the hydrophobicity of proteins hou et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 in addition high temperatures induce reactions that affect the functional groups for example the dehydration and decarboxylation reactions of the organic matter occurred at high temperatures resulting in a decrease in the oxygen containing functional groups such as the coo group at about 1405 cm 1 the coh group at 1155 cm 1 and the oh group at 3413 cm 1 funke and ziegler 2010 the characteristic peak associated with the substituent in the benzene ring at 860 cm 1 gradually disappeared with the increase in temperature which was attributed to the maillard reaction of the aromatic proteins at high temperature su et al 2015 and this can be confirmed by the xps analysis the absorbance of the characteristic peak at 1650 cm 1 which is related to the co group increased after the temperature was over 150 c also it is most likely that the reductones and aldehydes were generated by the amine aldehyde condensation of the biopolymers lund and ray 2017 su et al 2015 these hydrothermal reactions consumed the hydrophilic functional groups in the biopolymers resulting in the decreased in the hydrophilicity of the sludge particles and the hydrophobic groups produced developed the hydrophobic interaction between the eps and bpb 3 6 response of the functional groups in eps to the changes of temperature 3 6 1 response of the functional groups in eps to the temperature changes two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos can enhance the vtis resolution and obtain detailed information regarding the changes in the sample under temperature variations in order to further understand the response of the functional groups of eps to the temperature changes the high temperature vtis results were analysed using 2d cos as depicted in fig 6 a the synchro correlation map showed there were night auto peaks on the diagonal of 1650 cm 1 1540 cm 1 1500 cm 1 1450 cm 1 1405 cm 1 1320 cm 1 1200 cm 1 and 1025 cm 1 the peak at 1500 cm 1 is attributed to the amide ii band split and displacement at high temperature and the peak at 1320 cm 1 was produced by the s o stretching whose intensity was weak therefore the changes of the six automatic peaks which are located at 1025 cm 1 1200 cm 1 1405 cm 1 1450 cm 1 1540 cm 1 and 1650 cm 1 were evaluated through the analysis of the synchronous and asynchronous map the response degree of these peaks to the increase in temperature followed the order 1200 cm 1 1540 cm 1 1650 cm 1 1405 cm 1 1025 cm 1 1450 cm 1 thus the peak at 1200 cm 1 had the highest response degree to the increase in temperature indicating that the organic functional groups near the characteristic peaks cn stretching and nh bending of the amide iii band 1240 cm 1 and the co c stretching in the polysaccharides 1115 cm 1 showed the greatest reaction activity with the increasing temperature and the nh in 1540 cm 1 was also affected obviously by the high temperature condition the results indicated that the occurred of amine aldehyde condensation reactions caused the dramatically change of these functional groups the aliphatic chain group located at 1450 cm 1 showed the lowest response degree and rate indicating that the aliphatic compounds were more thermally stable and that a higher decomposition temperature 150 c was needed and the sequence of the band variation followed the order 1650 cm 1 1405 cm 1 1540 cm 1 1200 cm 1 1025 cm 1 1450 cm 1 thus the destruction of the amide i bands structure was occurred firstly with the increasing temperature led to the peptide chain to unfold and the change of the secondary structure of the protein then the nh in amide ii amide iii bands started to be hydrolyzed and the oh began to be involved in the dehydration and condensation reactions the decomposition of these groups led to the decrease of the eps hydrophilicity fig 6c and d showed magnified patterns of amide i bands 1600 1700 cm 1 which could reveal the variation of protein secondary structure under high temperature condition the response degree of these peaks to the increase in temperature followed the order α helix 1650 1660 cm 1 β sheet 1630 1640 cm 1 random coil 1640 1650 cm 1 β turn 1680 1690 cm 1 and the sequence of the band variation followed the order β turn random coil α helix β sheet the results indicated that α helix and β sheet have the greater reaction activity with the increasing temperature and the β turn and random coil were more sensitive to the high temperature condition also the moving window spectrum could provide information on how the functional groups varied with the different temperatures fig 6e and f in the freezing process the amide i and ii bands most dramatically changed with the decrease in temperature to around 60 c in the high temperature range the changes in the functional groups of eps were most evident from 70 c to 150 c the amide band of the protein molecules change obviously at about 70 c indicated that the structure of the amide band started to destroy meanwhile the corresponding functional groups of the polysaccharides most dramatically changed at about 120 150 c demonstrated that the polysaccharides consumption was obviously intensified during this period the response of the functional groups illustrated the pathways of maillard reaction wang et al 2021 and it also further confirmed the relationship between eps hydrophilicity and transformation of biopolymers with the increased in temperature the release of the biopolymers enhanced the hydrophilic components at the temperature of less than 120 c and the dehydration reaction and aromatization of biopolymers at higher temperatures resulting in a decrease in eps hydrophilicity 3 6 2 interaction between protein polysaccharide and ha under temperature change to explore the interaction of the organic fractions in the eps the two dimensional variation temperature infrared spectra of the ha bsa mixture composed of ha and bsa and the pure bsa were analyzed as shown in fig 7 compared with the 2d cos of bsa fig 7a the characteristic peaks of the functional groups of protein in the ha bsa mixture were obviously displaced the migration band was centered at about 1400 cm 1 which was associated with the stretching of the oh group in the has guan et al 2018 as seen in fig 7c and d the synchronous and asynchronous map shows that the response of the amide ii band to the temperature was faster than that of the amide i band in the ha bsa mixture which is contrary to the response of the bsa in addition the changes in the three amide bands in the ha bsa mixture showed a similar trend but the change in the bsa was different this observation indicates that the ha presence affected the response of the amide band in the protein to the temperature the response of the amide iii bands was earlier than the responses of the amide i and amide ii bands in the ha bsa mixture and bsa and it also differed with the response order in the eps this observation indicated that the polysaccharides presence also affected the amide iii response to temperature some studies have shown that the nh group in the amide ii band could be affected by external hydrogen bonds resulting in the displacement of their infrared characteristic peaks barth 2007 liu et al 2019b the peak splitting and shifting of the amide ii band in high temperature vtis was affected by the amide i band in the protein and the oh group in the has through the vtis and 2d cos the changes in the amide iii band showed a similar change to that of the corresponding functional groups of polysaccharides thus the interaction between the polysaccharides and the proteins was likely associated with the amide iii band also the existence of polysaccharides could improve the protein stability with the change in temperature while the interaction between the ha and the protein affected the properties of the amide ii and amide i bands guan et al 2018 found that some protein parts can be inserted into the cavity of the ha through hydrophobic actions in aqueous solutions these released biopolymers may form aggregates through hydrophobic actions and the hydrophilic groups was exposed resulting in the decreased in hydrophobic sites and more water enclosed in sludge floc with the increase in temperature the peptide chain was expanded then the interaction force between the protein and the ha was destroyed and the has was released therefore the characteristic peak of the functional group of the has 1384 cm 1 in the vtis started to obviously change when the temperature exceeded 170 c also the polysaccharides could bind with some groups outside the protein molecules by hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction which are more susceptible to temperature variation 3 7 effects of eps transformation on the macroscopic physical properties of sludge at varying temperature as discussed above eps showed different changes during the hydrothermal and freezing treatments and these changes had distinct effects on the macroscopic physical properties of the sludge the freezing treatment showed a less biopolymer solubilization effect and subsequent in macroscopic physical properties of sludge compared with hydrothermal treatment meanwhile the freezing treatment caused the solubilization of biopolymers and destruction of the hydrophilic functional groups such as hydroxy amino and carboxyl groups producing small organic matters consequently the eps hydrophobicity was enhanced and the negative charge density of the sludge floc was reduced resulting in the release of bound water and improvement of sludge macroscopic physical properties dewaterability and rheological behavior the dewaterability and fluidity of the sludge showed a two stage reaction in the hydrothermal process from 70 c to 120 c the biopolymers proteins and polysaccharides were dissolved and released from the sludge the hydrophilic groups were exposed and more water enclosed in sludge floc the released colloidal biopolymers caused the increase of negative charge density on the surface of the sludge resulting in an increase in the repulsion force among the flocs the gel like network structure formed by the biopolymers contributing to flow resistance of the sludge under high shear stress and release of high mw organic matters caused deterioration of the sludge dewaterability and fluidity the characteristic functional groups such as hydroxy carboxyl groups and amide band in proteins kept decreasing and then they underwent an obvious change with the increase in temperature to higher than 70 c the spectrum of the amide i band showed the peptide chain unfolding gradually with increasing temperature when the temperature exceeded 120 c the macromolecular organic substances were continually hydrolysed and side reactions were involved for example the melanin like substance produced by the maillard reaction continuously deepened the filtrate color the deoxidization and decarboxylation of the oxygen containing functional groups and the cyclization of the n containing organic matter enhanced the hydrophobicity of solid phase of sludge 150 c was a threshold of the changes in the physical and chemical properties of the sludge and the transformation of the organic fractions in the supernatant which consists with the previous studies bougrier et al 2008 wang and li 2015 yu et al 2014 under this condition the biopolymers were further hydrolyzed into small molecules the negative charge density of the sludge surface decreased eps hydrophobicity was enhanced as a result the sludge viscosity μ decreased and the fluidity and dewaterability were gradually improved fig 8 4 conclusion this study elucidated the eps transformation mechanisms at varying temperature ranged from 40 c to 200 c as well as established relationships between molecular structure of eps and macroscopic physical properties of was during freezing treatment small organic matters were produced via the destruction of hydrophilic functional groups hydroxy amino and carboxyl of biopolymers leading to the enhancement of biopolymers solubilization and hydrophobicity which reduced electrostatic repulsion of sludge improving sludge dewatering and rheological properties in terms of hydrothermal treatment the eps transformation showed two stage reactions at 70 120 c production of hydrophilic functional groups hydroxy amino and carboxyl in biopolymers increased electrostatic repulsion and eps hydrophily of sludge subsequently resulting in the deterioration of sludge dewaterability and fluidity whereas when the temperature was exceeded 120 c the macromolecular organic matters hydrolyzed completely and participated in maillard reaction and electrostatic repulsion of sludge decreased thus resulted in the improvement of sludge dewaterability and fluidity in addition the polysaccharides and the has could bind to the protein amide band via hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic actions which can enhance the protein stability subject to temperature variation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

16852,extracellular polymeric substances eps are important components of activated sludge whose content and composition have important effects on the macro physical properties of sludge in this study the response of eps in sludge to temperature 40 200 c was systematically investigated using xad resin fractionation variable temperature infrared spectra vtis and two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos the relationships between the molecular structure of eps and the macro physical properties rheological property and dewatering performance of waste activated sludge was at varying temperature were also established during the freezing treatment the solubilization of biopolymers and destruction of the hydrophilic functional groups hydroxy amino and carboxyl resulted in the production of small organic matters which enhanced eps hydrophobicity and reduced electrostatic repulsion of sludge and subsequent dewaterability improvement for the hydrothermal treatment the eps transformation showed a two stages reaction including stage i 70 120 c and stage ii 120 c stage i 70 120 c a plenty of hydrophilic functional groups hydroxy amino and carboxyl in eps were exposed via the solubilization of biopolymers which enhanced electrostatic repulsion of sludge and eps hydrophilicity and subsequence in deterioration of sludge dewaterability and fluidity however at stage ii 120 c the high temperature caused hydrolyzation of macromolecular organic matters in completely in which the secondary structure of the protein was destroyed causing the peptide chain to unfold in addition the reduction of α helix and β sheet content and intensified maillard reaction decreased electrostatic repulsion of sludge thus resulted in the improvement of sludge dewaterability and fluidity this study enriched the theoretical basis of the optimal control of sludge treatment based on temperature regulation keywords extracellular polymeric substances waste activated sludge macro physical properties variable temperature infrared spectroscopy freezing treatment hydrothermal treatment 1 introduction waste activated sludge was is a major product of waste water treatment plants more than 60 million tons of sludge with moisture content of 80 were produced annually in china yin et al 2018 wu et al 2020 was generally contains over 90wt of water the dewatering process is of engineering practical importance in reducing water content and volume for sludge subsequent transportation and safe disposal usually chemical additions e g acid ferric and such etc and mechanical dewatering techniques press filter were united for thickened sludge conditioning however the cost of above dewatering processes represents a significant of the total operation cost in typical municipal wastewater treatment plants mwtps zhao et al 2015 and also failing to meet the increasingly stringent criteria of subsequent sludge disposal in addition extracellular polymeric substances eps are in the form of gel like structure in which highly bound to water molecules tan et al 2015 yuan et al 2014 and account for 60 80 of the biomass of activated sludge have important effects on the surface charge floc stability and macro physical properties liu et al 2019a zhang et al 2019 further reducing intracellular bound water from eps still remains a challenge thus numerous processes including coagulation flocculation chemical oxidation zhang et al 2015 wang et al 2009 ultrasonic pretreatment bien and wolny 1997 hydrothermal treatment guan et al 2012 and freezing treatment gao 2011 have been supplemented to regulate eps structures and improve the mechanical dewatering performance of sludge among these strategies sludge conditioning processes based on temperature regulation hydrothermal treatment and freezing treatment are highly effective in enhancing sludge dewatering performance during sludge freezing process the growth of ice crystals can continuously exclude and compress floc and other particles destroy cells release organic matters and intracellular bound water resulting in sludge dewaterability enhancement gao et al 2006 gao 2011 for example hu et al 2011 found that freeze thaw treatment promoted the release of organic matters in sludge in the curing stage gao 2011 claimed that the combination of alkalization and freezing treatment could promote the release of organic matter and ammonia nitrogen sun et al 2018 showed that adding nitrite prior to freezing process can promote the release of low molecular weight proteins and polysaccharides similarly hydrothermal treatment can improve the hydrolysis of organic matter via solubilization of cells in sludge releasing bound water trapped in biopolymers bougrier et al 2008 wang and li 2015 in addition hydrothermal treatment is also used as a pretreatment of anaerobic digestion to improve the stability of the organic matter and biogas production during anaerobic digestion however previous studies regarding the freezing and hydrothermal treatments especially thermal hydrolysis technology always focus on the sludge dewatering enhancement or biogas production efficiency the eps transformation and its influential mechanisms on the macro physical properties dewaterability and rheological behavior of sludge during freezing and hydrothermal treatments still lack systematic investigation variable temperature infrared spectra vtis can continuously and momentarily observe variations of functional group characteristics and record the infrared spectrum of samples at varying temperatures low temperature vtis is commonly used to study the vitrification transition of polymer materials and high temperature vtis is usually used to examine the structural properties of various materials and the thermodynamic parameters in chemical reactions at varying temperatures for example zhang et al 2000 studied the relationship between the dehydrating and recrystallization behaviors of titanate crystals by vtis and tian et al 2012 used variable temperature infrared analysis to study the conformational transformation of soybean proteins with the change in temperature delgado and arean 2011 used vtis to study the adsorption thermodynamic of various gasses concerning h beta zeolites and obtained the adsorption enthalpy and entropy therefore vtis is a powerful tool to study the physical changes and chemical processes of substances such as the phase transition intermolecular forces chemical reactions etc in addition previous studies have proved the interaction between protein and humic like components in natural organic matters nom using infrared and fluorescence quenching guan et al 2018 wang et al 2015 the interactions of organic compounds in sludge do not only affect the eps properties but they also affect the macro physical properties of sludge the vtis might be the potential technique to get insights of eps transformation at varying temperature and elucidate influential mechanism of temperature on the sludge dewaterability the main objectives of this work are to 1 investigate the effect of different temperatures 40 200 c on the macroscopic properties of sludge fluidity and dewaterability 2 unravel the influential mechanism of temperature on eps hydrophilicity and its components transformation using vtis and 2d cos methods 3 establish the relationship between molecular structure of eps and macroscopic physical properties under sludge treatment based on temperature regulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the waste activated sludge was was

purchased from sinopharm chemical reagents co ltd in china in addition the experimental water was deionized water 2 2 experimental methods 2 2 1 eps extraction in this study eps was extracted by cation exchange resin cer technique dowex marathon c 20 50 mesh sodium form fluka 91 973 frølund et al 1996 specifically was was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min and the pellets were washed twice by 100 mmol l nacl solution cer was added to the re suspended sludge pellets with the dosage of 60 g g total suspended solids tss and the mixture was stirred for 12 h at 200 rpm and 4 c then the mixture was re centrifugated at 10 000 rpm for 10 min and the eps fraction was collected after filtrating through 0 45 μm acetate cellulose membranes and the content of corresponding organic matter in eps was shown in table s1 2 2 2 sludge and eps treatment through temperature regulation 200 ml of was were added into two 500 ml polyethylene terephthalate plastic bottles and they were sealed at 40 and 20 c for 2 h for the freezing treatment as for the hydrothermal treatment the was was poured into a 200 ml lined vessel of teflonlined ethylene teflonlined vessel sealed in a high pressure reaction kettle and then transferred to a blast oven to be heated for 2 h at 80 200 c eps was treated as the same way to investigate the properties of eps after freezing treatment and hydrothermal treatment 2 2 3 preparation of the mixed simulants the simulant preparation was based on the protein and humic acid content in the eps and the ha amount was appropriately increased the ha 20 mg l and bovine serum albumin bsa 1000 mg l solutions were mixed and stirred at 150 rpm for 1 h prior to freeze drying to obtain solid samples for the vtis analysis 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 macro physical properties of sludge 2 3 1 1 sludge dewaterability assessment details for specific resistance to filtration srf and capillary suction time cst measurements are provided in si text 1 2 3 1 2 test and simulation of the sludge rheology the sludge rheology was tested on a rheometer physica mcr302 rheometer anton paar austria with the temperature maintained at 25 c by peltier control a pp50 plate sensor with a 49 94 mm diameter and 2 0 mm gap was used flow curves of sludge samples were obtained using a control shear rate model and the rheological test was measured in the logarithmic growth phase at an increased shear rate from 0 01 to 600 s 1 the flow curves were obtained by plotting the shear stress against the shear rate the rheological models used to fit the flow curve was provided in si text 2 2 3 2 variable temperature infrared spectroscopy vtis analysis a fourier transform infrared spectrometer thermo fisher nicolet is50 with the in situ reaction cell and the associated temperature control accessory harrick were used to measure the variable temperature infrared measurement of eps bsa and the mixed simulant the test temperature ranges were 100 0 c and 20 200 c every 10 c residence 10 min and the analysis range was 650 4000cm 1 2 3 3 characterization of sludge floc properties the sludge samples were freeze dried under vacuum for 72 h and scanning electron microscope sem images were measured using a field emission scanning electron microscopy zeiss gemini300 german a zetasizer nano zs90 was used to measure the zeta potential of sludge before and after treatment 2 3 4 analysis of organic substances in sludge the organic content in sludge supernatant before and after treatment was analyzed using total organic carbon toc analyzer shimadzu japan more detailed information regarding the organic transformation was obtained by xps escalab 250xi boyue china proteins were measured using the lowry method using bsa as the standard whereas polysaccharides were measured using the anthrone sulfuric acid method using glucose as the standard molecular weight mw was determined by a waters liquid chromatography system that consisted of a waters 2487 dual l absorbance detector waters 1525 pump system a shodex kw 802 5 gel chromatography column shoko japan was used for organic materials separation 2 3 5 hydrophobic hydrophilic characteristics analysis of eps eps after freezing treatment and hydrothermal treatment was fractionated using amberlite xad 4 xad 8 resins the hydrophobic fractions were the compounds which were absorbed on xad 4 and xad 8 resins and the hydrophilic fractions was the compounds not retained on either resin wei et al 2020 additionally the hydrophobicity of eps was also analyzed by the binding ability with hydrophobic chromophore bromophenol blue chelh et al 2006 2 3 6 statistical methods the fitting of the rheological data was completed by originpro 2018 the reconstructed data matrix was then progressed using the 2d shige software kwansei gakuin university japan statistical analysis was carried out using the spss statistics version 21 0 spss chicago il usa 3 results and analysis 3 1 variation of the macroscopic physical properties of sludge with temperature 3 1 1 changes in the sludge dewatering performance with temperature batch experiments were performed to compare the sludge dewatering performance at varying temperature from figs 1a and s1 the cst and srf were significantly decreased with freezing treatment after being treated at 20 c the cst of sludge reduced from 6 02 s l g to 0 98 s l g and the srf decreased from 2 31 1014 m kg to 9 86 1013 m kg demonstrating that sludge dewaterability was significantly improved in the hydrothermal treatment srf and cst increased before 120 c and reached the maximum of 2 82 1015 m kg 1 and 183 29 s l g respectively and then reduced 3 1 2 change in the sludge rheological properties with temperature the rheological properties can provide information about fluid microstructure as shown in fig 1 b the slope of flow curves of all test samples with increasing shear stress and shear rate was illustrated and the viscosity is defined as the ratio of shear stress to shear rate which can be evaluated by means of the flow curve eshtiaghi et al 2013 all sludge samples had yield stress which indicates the existence of interactive forces between the sludge flocs when the shear stress was sufficient to break the binding force between the flocs the flow resistance decreased and the flocs began to flow the flow curves of all the samples had the basic characteristics of the yielding pseudoplastic fluid and the slope of the curves decreased with the increase of shear rate hershel bulkley h b pseudoplastic and newton models were used to fit the sludge flow curve respectively the calculated parameters of each model are given in table s2 the flow curves of all sludge samples were best fitted to the h b model r2 0 994 where n flow index reflects the strength of the sludge floc and k consistency index reflects the viscosity of the fluid also the sludge consistency index k decreased after the freezing treatment while it firstly increased and then decreased with increasing in temperature under hydrothermal treatment the rheological properties can provide information about fluid microstructure the existence of biopolymer network structure deteriorated the sludge fluidity and it also affected the dewatering performance in constant pressure conditions stickland 2015 therefore the same patterns of changes in sludge dewaterability and fluidity were observed this result suggests that the change of flocs structure and the transformation of biopolymers played the leading role in the physical properties of sludge 3 2 change in sludge floc properties with temperature fig s2 presented that the zeta potential of the sludge decreased from 34 1 mv to 45 3 mv as the temperature increased from 25 c to 120 c then it increased to 14 1 mv by raising temperature to 200 c on the other hand after the freezing treatment at 40 c the zeta potential of the sludge increased to 21 8 mv this is might because the growing ice crystals could force sludge particles to merge together and grow into larger particles which disrupted the eps structure and reduced the electrostatic interactions between the sludge flocs the decreased negative charges on floc surface led to the decreased of electrostatic interactions between the sludge flocs resulting the stabilization and flocculation of sludge which contributes to the dewatering improvement cao et al 2021 the result indicated that both freezing and hydrothermal treatments affected the negative charges on the floc surface and subsequent the interaction between sludge flocs which may result in the change of sludge dewaterability and flowability the sludge floc morphologies after being treated under different temperatures were observed through fe sem from fig s3 sludge treated at 40 c was broken and more denser flocs were formed and consolidated morphology compared to raw sludge fig s3 the irreversible destruction of cells and flocs reduced the flowing of sludge resistance although there were no obvious changes after the mild 80 c hydrothermal treatment the sludge flocs surface became loose with some irregular filamentous bacteria after treated under 100 120 c under this condition the release of hydrophilic organics led to deterioration of sludge dewatering performance however when the temperature was increased to 160 c the filaments almost disappeared and the surface of sludge floc tended to become rough and porous with the further increase in temperature 180 c the floc structure was completely destroyed into small fragments the destroyed of the network structure at high hydrothermal treatment led to a decrease in the shearing resistance of sludge particles resulting in the enhancement of flow capacity and dewaterability of sludge meanwhile the srf and cst decreased from the maximum of 2 82 1015 m kg 1 and 183 29 s l g at 120 c to 1 88 1014 m kg 1 and 1 088 s l g at 180 c the viscosity of sludge dropped sharply after hydrothermal treated at 180 c and the flow curve of sludge sample was close to newtonian fluid properties 3 3 changes in the sludge organic matter with temperature to examine the biopolymers transformation under different temperature treatments organics of supernatant in treated sludge were quantified as shown in fig 2 a by comparison dissolved organic matters doms in sludge treated by both freezing and hydrothermal methods were significantly increased and the hydrothermal treatment led to a more significant release of biopolymers compared to the freezing treatment gao 2011 proved that the amount released of the organic matter after 24 h of sludge freezing was close to that after 30 min of hydrothermal treatment at 103 c in addition hu et al 2011 found that the release of organics mainly occurred in the curing stage freezing more than 3 h and little amount of organic matter was released in the freezing stage fig 2b shows the content of proteins and polysaccharides in supernatant of sludge increased after freezing and hydrothermal treatments the polysaccharides increased significantly from 80 c to 140 c and it reached a maximum at 160 c then decreased with the further increase of temperature the maillard reactions at higher temperatures may have resulted in polysaccharide consumption zhang et al 2020 the mw distributions and contents of organic matters in supernatant of sludge after the freezing and hydrothermal treatments was presented in fig 2c and fig s4 the relative quantity of high mw organic matters 5 kda increased after freezing treatment at 20 c while decreased after freezing treatment at 40 c these results indicated that freezing treatment caused the decomposition of high mw organic matters and released more mid mw organic matters 5 kda into sludge bulk solution the mild hydrothermal treatment 80 100 c caused release of low mw organic matters 1 kda then more mid mw and high mw biopolymers were solubilized with the increase of temperature during ht treatment under 120 c the ionization of functional groups including carboxyl hydroxyl and phosphate groups on eps during hydrolysis stage increased the negative charges of floc surfaces xu et al 2018 yuan et al 2011 resulting in enhanced sludge electrostatic repulsion and subsequent dewaterability deterioration however when temperature was higher than 120 c the biopolymers in sludge were gradually hydrolyzed into smaller molecules and they lost the electric double layer of the gel like structure for example wang et al 2021 found that the biopolymer in the liquid phase could form a gel like network structure and led to the deteriorated of dewaterability which indicated that network structure formed by high mw organic matters had better water retention capacity as the temperature of hydrothermal treatment increased the intensification of high mw biopolymers hydrolysis reactions led to the destruction of gel like network structure and release of bound water to understand the organic matter transformation in sludge the n1s xps measurement was further applied on polymer samples of treated sludge as depicted in fig s5 there was no obvious changes upon n containing components in eps after the freezing treatment indicated that the protein structure remained relatively stable however the peak area of the protein n in sludge gradually decreased with the increase of temperature during hydrothermal treatment when the temperature was increased to 160 c protein n content significantly decreased while pyrrole n began to appear and continuously increased with further increase in temperature as a result the moisture of sludge cake was decreased 3 4 polarity distribution of eps with temperature as shown in fig 3 a the content of hydrophobic fraction was increased after freezing treatment at 20 c demonstrating freezing treatment caused enhancement of eps hydrophobicity after freezing treatment at 40 c the content of hydrophilic fraction increased slightly this is likely because that freezing treatment caused decomposition of eps and produced some hydrophilic biopolymers additionally the hydrophobicity of eps evaluated by the bpb method showed that more bpb was bound to eps after freezing treatment fig 3b this observation indicates freezing treatment induces the exposure of more hydrophobic functional groups of eps the increased hydrophilic fraction of eps after hydrothermal treatment at 80 c and 100 c illustrated that hydrophilic small molecular organic matters were produced due to solubilization of eps in hydrothermal process which weakened the hydrophobic interaction between eps and bpb with further increase in temperature from 120 c to 200 c the hydrophobic interaction between eps and bpb was enhanced and the hydrophilic fraction was reduced 3 5 response of eps to temperature variation to get insights of temperature effects on the functional groups of eps during the freezing and hydrothermal treatments the eps were extracted and analysed by vtis technique the infrared spectra wavelength range of 650 4000 cm 1 of eps during the freezing 100 c 0 c and hydrothermal 20 c 200 c treatments were illustrated in figs 4 and 5 respectively the functional groups of eps can be divided into hydrocarbons amides groups in proteins polysaccharides and nucleic acids and the assignments of these peaks were displayed in table s3 in the infrared spectrum of eps subjected to the freezing treatment with the decrease in temperature the absorbance of the characteristic peak near 3400 cm 1 constantly increased and the characteristic peak at 2367 cm 1 gradually appeared illustrating that freezing treatment affected the stretching of the oh in the hydroxy therefore it can be confirmed that the environment of organic matter changed significantly around 60 c tompa et al 2009 found that the hydration layer of protein began to freeze at 53 c and the protein molecules underwent dynamic transformation when the temperature decreased to 60 c as depicted in fig 4c the characteristic peak of the amide i bands in eps were sharpened and they became more intensive in the freezing process indicating that the secondary structure of protein was greatly altered these suggested that the stretching and vibration of the hydrophilic functional groups in eps were gradually enhanced with the decreasing temperature which made these groups vulnerable to be damaged during freezing thaw treatment therefore after freezing treatment the eps hydrophobicity was increased and some smaller molecular organic matters was released meanwhile the absorbance of the wide characteristic peak near 1100 cm 1 was decreased under freezing which was due to the destruction of functional groups of polysaccharides nucleic acids with the decreasing temperature in the high temperature vtis of eps fig 5b the amide ii and amide iii bands showed more distinct variations compared to amide i band which might be related to the strength of hydrogen bonds between molecules the vibration of the amide i band mainly comes from the co stretching vibration casal and mantsch 1984 mennucci and martinez 2005 and the vibrations of amide ii and amide iii bands mainly comes from nh stretching and cn bending barth 2007 thus the amide ii and amide iii bands are more sensitive to temperature compared to amide i band the characteristic peak of the amide ii band 1540 cm 1 was resolved at high temperature and it shifted to two sides barth 2007 suggested that there are coupling effects between adjacent peptide bonds in the amide ii and amide iii bands which affects the vibration and displacement of these groups in the infrared test the amide ii band and the original equilibrium state between the groups were destroyed under high temperature condition and the split characteristic peak generated a displacement also a part of the characteristic peak was shifted to the high frequency band by the action of the amide i band and the other part was shifted to the low frequency band the high temperature vtis of the amide i band secondary structure is shown in fig 5c and there are four categories of amide i band including β sheet 1630 1640 cm1 random coil 1640 1650 cm 1 α helix 1650 1660 cm 1 and β turn 1680 1690 cm 1 the characteristic peaks corresponding to the α helix β sheet and random coil decreased with the increase in temperature which indicates that the high temperature destroyed the secondary structure of the protein causing the peptide chain to unfold the decrease in the α helix content leads to the enhancement of the hydrophobicity of proteins hou et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 in addition high temperatures induce reactions that affect the functional groups for example the dehydration and decarboxylation reactions of the organic matter occurred at high temperatures resulting in a decrease in the oxygen containing functional groups such as the coo group at about 1405 cm 1 the coh group at 1155 cm 1 and the oh group at 3413 cm 1 funke and ziegler 2010 the characteristic peak associated with the substituent in the benzene ring at 860 cm 1 gradually disappeared with the increase in temperature which was attributed to the maillard reaction of the aromatic proteins at high temperature su et al 2015 and this can be confirmed by the xps analysis the absorbance of the characteristic peak at 1650 cm 1 which is related to the co group increased after the temperature was over 150 c also it is most likely that the reductones and aldehydes were generated by the amine aldehyde condensation of the biopolymers lund and ray 2017 su et al 2015 these hydrothermal reactions consumed the hydrophilic functional groups in the biopolymers resulting in the decreased in the hydrophilicity of the sludge particles and the hydrophobic groups produced developed the hydrophobic interaction between the eps and bpb 3 6 response of the functional groups in eps to the changes of temperature 3 6 1 response of the functional groups in eps to the temperature changes two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos can enhance the vtis resolution and obtain detailed information regarding the changes in the sample under temperature variations in order to further understand the response of the functional groups of eps to the temperature changes the high temperature vtis results were analysed using 2d cos as depicted in fig 6 a the synchro correlation map showed there were night auto peaks on the diagonal of 1650 cm 1 1540 cm 1 1500 cm 1 1450 cm 1 1405 cm 1 1320 cm 1 1200 cm 1 and 1025 cm 1 the peak at 1500 cm 1 is attributed to the amide ii band split and displacement at high temperature and the peak at 1320 cm 1 was produced by the s o stretching whose intensity was weak therefore the changes of the six automatic peaks which are located at 1025 cm 1 1200 cm 1 1405 cm 1 1450 cm 1 1540 cm 1 and 1650 cm 1 were evaluated through the analysis of the synchronous and asynchronous map the response degree of these peaks to the increase in temperature followed the order 1200 cm 1 1540 cm 1 1650 cm 1 1405 cm 1 1025 cm 1 1450 cm 1 thus the peak at 1200 cm 1 had the highest response degree to the increase in temperature indicating that the organic functional groups near the characteristic peaks cn stretching and nh bending of the amide iii band 1240 cm 1 and the co c stretching in the polysaccharides 1115 cm 1 showed the greatest reaction activity with the increasing temperature and the nh in 1540 cm 1 was also affected obviously by the high temperature condition the results indicated that the occurred of amine aldehyde condensation reactions caused the dramatically change of these functional groups the aliphatic chain group located at 1450 cm 1 showed the lowest response degree and rate indicating that the aliphatic compounds were more thermally stable and that a higher decomposition temperature 150 c was needed and the sequence of the band variation followed the order 1650 cm 1 1405 cm 1 1540 cm 1 1200 cm 1 1025 cm 1 1450 cm 1 thus the destruction of the amide i bands structure was occurred firstly with the increasing temperature led to the peptide chain to unfold and the change of the secondary structure of the protein then the nh in amide ii amide iii bands started to be hydrolyzed and the oh began to be involved in the dehydration and condensation reactions the decomposition of these groups led to the decrease of the eps hydrophilicity fig 6c and d showed magnified patterns of amide i bands 1600 1700 cm 1 which could reveal the variation of protein secondary structure under high temperature condition the response degree of these peaks to the increase in temperature followed the order α helix 1650 1660 cm 1 β sheet 1630 1640 cm 1 random coil 1640 1650 cm 1 β turn 1680 1690 cm 1 and the sequence of the band variation followed the order β turn random coil α helix β sheet the results indicated that α helix and β sheet have the greater reaction activity with the increasing temperature and the β turn and random coil were more sensitive to the high temperature condition also the moving window spectrum could provide information on how the functional groups varied with the different temperatures fig 6e and f in the freezing process the amide i and ii bands most dramatically changed with the decrease in temperature to around 60 c in the high temperature range the changes in the functional groups of eps were most evident from 70 c to 150 c the amide band of the protein molecules change obviously at about 70 c indicated that the structure of the amide band started to destroy meanwhile the corresponding functional groups of the polysaccharides most dramatically changed at about 120 150 c demonstrated that the polysaccharides consumption was obviously intensified during this period the response of the functional groups illustrated the pathways of maillard reaction wang et al 2021 and it also further confirmed the relationship between eps hydrophilicity and transformation of biopolymers with the increased in temperature the release of the biopolymers enhanced the hydrophilic components at the temperature of less than 120 c and the dehydration reaction and aromatization of biopolymers at higher temperatures resulting in a decrease in eps hydrophilicity 3 6 2 interaction between protein polysaccharide and ha under temperature change to explore the interaction of the organic fractions in the eps the two dimensional variation temperature infrared spectra of the ha bsa mixture composed of ha and bsa and the pure bsa were analyzed as shown in fig 7 compared with the 2d cos of bsa fig 7a the characteristic peaks of the functional groups of protein in the ha bsa mixture were obviously displaced the migration band was centered at about 1400 cm 1 which was associated with the stretching of the oh group in the has guan et al 2018 as seen in fig 7c and d the synchronous and asynchronous map shows that the response of the amide ii band to the temperature was faster than that of the amide i band in the ha bsa mixture which is contrary to the response of the bsa in addition the changes in the three amide bands in the ha bsa mixture showed a similar trend but the change in the bsa was different this observation indicates that the ha presence affected the response of the amide band in the protein to the temperature the response of the amide iii bands was earlier than the responses of the amide i and amide ii bands in the ha bsa mixture and bsa and it also differed with the response order in the eps this observation indicated that the polysaccharides presence also affected the amide iii response to temperature some studies have shown that the nh group in the amide ii band could be affected by external hydrogen bonds resulting in the displacement of their infrared characteristic peaks barth 2007 liu et al 2019b the peak splitting and shifting of the amide ii band in high temperature vtis was affected by the amide i band in the protein and the oh group in the has through the vtis and 2d cos the changes in the amide iii band showed a similar change to that of the corresponding functional groups of polysaccharides thus the interaction between the polysaccharides and the proteins was likely associated with the amide iii band also the existence of polysaccharides could improve the protein stability with the change in temperature while the interaction between the ha and the protein affected the properties of the amide ii and amide i bands guan et al 2018 found that some protein parts can be inserted into the cavity of the ha through hydrophobic actions in aqueous solutions these released biopolymers may form aggregates through hydrophobic actions and the hydrophilic groups was exposed resulting in the decreased in hydrophobic sites and more water enclosed in sludge floc with the increase in temperature the peptide chain was expanded then the interaction force between the protein and the ha was destroyed and the has was released therefore the characteristic peak of the functional group of the has 1384 cm 1 in the vtis started to obviously change when the temperature exceeded 170 c also the polysaccharides could bind with some groups outside the protein molecules by hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interaction which are more susceptible to temperature variation 3 7 effects of eps transformation on the macroscopic physical properties of sludge at varying temperature as discussed above eps showed different changes during the hydrothermal and freezing treatments and these changes had distinct effects on the macroscopic physical properties of the sludge the freezing treatment showed a less biopolymer solubilization effect and subsequent in macroscopic physical properties of sludge compared with hydrothermal treatment meanwhile the freezing treatment caused the solubilization of biopolymers and destruction of the hydrophilic functional groups such as hydroxy amino and carboxyl groups producing small organic matters consequently the eps hydrophobicity was enhanced and the negative charge density of the sludge floc was reduced resulting in the release of bound water and improvement of sludge macroscopic physical properties dewaterability and rheological behavior the dewaterability and fluidity of the sludge showed a two stage reaction in the hydrothermal process from 70 c to 120 c the biopolymers proteins and polysaccharides were dissolved and released from the sludge the hydrophilic groups were exposed and more water enclosed in sludge floc the released colloidal biopolymers caused the increase of negative charge density on the surface of the sludge resulting in an increase in the repulsion force among the flocs the gel like network structure formed by the biopolymers contributing to flow resistance of the sludge under high shear stress and release of high mw organic matters caused deterioration of the sludge dewaterability and fluidity the characteristic functional groups such as hydroxy carboxyl groups and amide band in proteins kept decreasing and then they underwent an obvious change with the increase in temperature to higher than 70 c the spectrum of the amide i band showed the peptide chain unfolding gradually with increasing temperature when the temperature exceeded 120 c the macromolecular organic substances were continually hydrolysed and side reactions were involved for example the melanin like substance produced by the maillard reaction continuously deepened the filtrate color the deoxidization and decarboxylation of the oxygen containing functional groups and the cyclization of the n containing organic matter enhanced the hydrophobicity of solid phase of sludge 150 c was a threshold of the changes in the physical and chemical properties of the sludge and the transformation of the organic fractions in the supernatant which consists with the previous studies bougrier et al 2008 wang and li 2015 yu et al 2014 under this condition the biopolymers were further hydrolyzed into small molecules the negative charge density of the sludge surface decreased eps hydrophobicity was enhanced as a result the sludge viscosity μ decreased and the fluidity and dewaterability were gradually improved fig 8 4 conclusion this study elucidated the eps transformation mechanisms at varying temperature ranged from 40 c to 200 c as well as established relationships between molecular structure of eps and macroscopic physical properties of was during freezing treatment small organic matters were produced via the destruction of hydrophilic functional groups hydroxy amino and carboxyl of biopolymers leading to the enhancement of biopolymers solubilization and hydrophobicity which reduced electrostatic repulsion of sludge improving sludge dewatering and rheological properties in terms of hydrothermal treatment the eps transformation showed two stage reactions at 70 120 c production of hydrophilic functional groups hydroxy amino and carboxyl in biopolymers increased electrostatic repulsion and eps hydrophily of sludge subsequently resulting in the deterioration of sludge dewaterability and fluidity whereas when the temperature was exceeded 120 c the macromolecular organic matters hydrolyzed completely and participated in maillard reaction and electrostatic repulsion of sludge decreased thus resulted in the improvement of sludge dewaterability and fluidity in addition the polysaccharides and the has could bind to the protein amide band via hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic actions which can enhance the protein stability subject to temperature variation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

16853,despite elaborate regulation of agricultural pesticides their occurrence in non target areas has been linked to adverse ecological effects on insects in several field investigations their quantitative role in contributing to the biodiversity crisis is however still not known in a large scale study across 101 sites of small lowland streams in central europe germany we revealed that 83 of agricultural streams did not meet the pesticide related ecological targets for the first time we identified that agricultural nonpoint source pesticide pollution was the major driver in reducing vulnerable insect populations in aquatic invertebrate communities exceeding the relevance of other anthropogenic stressors such as poor hydro morphological structure and nutrients we identified that the current authorisation of pesticides which aims to prevent unacceptable adverse effects underestimates the actual ecological risk as i measured pesticide concentrations exceeded current regulatory acceptable concentrations in 81 of the agricultural streams investigated ii for several pesticides the inertia of the authorisation process impedes the incorporation of new scientific knowledge and iii existing thresholds of invertebrate toxicity drivers are not protective by a factor of 5 3 to 40 to provide adequate environmental quality objectives the authorisation process needs to include monitoring derived information on pesticide effects at the ecosystem level here we derive such thresholds that ensure a protection of the invertebrate stream community graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biodiversity crisis multiple stressors agricultural pesticides ecosystem monitoring pesticide regulation 1 introduction the ongoing biodiversity crisis is caused by a variety of anthropogenic stressors including pesticides european environmental agency 2015 however great uncertainty remains about the respective contribution of various stressors to ecosystem degradation this debate also relates to agricultural pesticides as some investigations have identified strong impacts of nonpoint source pesticide pollution on streams in australia beketov et al 2013 europe beketov et al 2013 liess and von der ohe 2005 north america chiu et al 2016 and south america hunt et al 2017 while others only identified comparatively low impacts of pesticides noges et al 2016 accordingly the question remains how severe the effects of pesticides are compared to other stressors and more specifically at which concentrations ecosystem effects occur and which species and functional parameters are affected only with this knowledge it is possible to prioritize and manage environmental stressors effectively the regulatory authorisation of agricultural pesticides is supposed to prevent unacceptable effects in the environment for example in australia the eu and the us an extensive test system based assessment scheme to protect communities in non target aquatic ecosystems has been established australian environment agency 2009 efsa 2013 us goverment 2004 this regulatory framework is based on the concept of scaling the effects of individual pesticides in single species test systems or model ecosystems to the effect in the ecosystem on this basis pesticide concentrations are determined at which damage to aquatic communities can be excluded however the combined effects of natural and anthropogenic stressors present in the ecosystem are not systematically included nor has there been any validation of the prediction of ecosystem effects to date in this investigation we therefore performed a monitoring in a large geographical area that allows us to quantify all relevant anthropogenic stressors with high temporal resolution additionally we identified the stream invertebrate community as a measure of ecological quality on this basis we aimed i to model the relative contribution of environmental variables determining the occurrence of aquatic invertebrates and to attribute measured pesticide pressure to ecological status ii to evaluate the protectivity of the aquatic pesticide risk assessment and iii to derive evidence based thresholds for the effects of pesticides considering the presence of additional stressors relevant to the ecosystem 2 materials and methods 2 1 site selection a total of 101 stream sections distributed over germany were sampled in april and july for 2018 and 2019 see map in si fig 1 11 sites were monitored both years the initial selection comprised 124 stream sections however we omitted those stream sections that were affected by drought lack of flow drying out or where the automatic rain event driven samplers eds did not function eds si chapter 3 the catchment areas of the monitoring sites were characterized by a gradient of agricultural land use agricultural land cover in hydrological catchment 0 100 and less than 5 of urban areas to focus on agricultural diffuse source pollution 86 streams were located in agricultural environments agricultural land cover in hydrological catchment 20 referred to as agricultural streams whereas 15 streams were located in areas with less agricultural influence agricultural land cover in catchment 20 see si chapter 1 for land use analyses catchment sizes were generally below 30 km² to represent small lowland streams where those with a catchment greater than 10 km2 n 60 correspond to the reporting requirements of the wfd commision 2000 stream sections with a catchment size of less than 10 km2 n 41 corresponding to the edge of field surface waters of the eu efsa risk assessment of plant protection products for aquatic organisms efsa 2013 detailed site characteristics are listed in tab si 1 2 2 water sampling and chemical analyses streams were sampled from april to july in 2018 and 2019 during the main application period of pesticides in spring and early summer for most crops szöcs et al 2017 during this time period grab samples n 520 were taken regularly in a three week cycle this sampling method followed the monthly sampling in governmental monitoring practices under the wfd regardless of weather conditions eds samples n 320 were taken with automated maxx tp5 rangendingen germany and bottle samplers liess and von der ohe 2005 in order to capture runoff induced exposure peaks associated with heavy rainfall liess et al 1999 see fig si 5 small streams with agricultural catchment area are subject to short term water level rise liess and von der ohe 2005 with the occurrence of storm events exceeding approximately 10 mm d schulz et al 1998 eds sampling for a duration of 3 hours and 20 minutes was triggered by a rise of water level of more than 5 cm so that waves did not trigger the sampling and every runoff event could be captured further details see si chapter 3 the samples were cooled to 4 c in the sampler until they were transported to the laboratory after a maximum of 48 h the total of 840 samples of both field campaigns 2018 n 411 and 2019 n 429 were analysed for pesticides trace elements and nutrients for pesticide analysis water samples were filtered and analysed via direct injection into lc ms ms without enrichment by multiple reaction monitoring reemtsma et al 2013 details see si chapter 4 the target analysis tested for 75 pesticides active substances and 33 pesticide metabolites pyrethroid insecticides and the herbicide glyphosate were not included due to analytical limitations the compound selection was established by prioritization according to active substance related sale quantities the consideration of current environmental quality standards eqs and the regulatory acceptable concentrations rac brinke et al 2017 see tab si 2 to test for further urban toxicants the samples of 2018 were additionally subjected to lchrms ms screening analytics details see si chapter 6 this screening analyses tested for 257 substances which were grouped into 16 compound classes including pharmaceuticals industrial chemicals rubber additives stimulants corrosion inhibitors plastic additives sweeteners biocides uv filters bitterns repellents per and polyfluorinated compounds food ingredients surfactants dyes and flame retardants see tab si 4 the concentrations of trace elements arsenic cadmium copper zinc lead mercury were analysed in water samples using agilent s icp ms 8000 triple quad at the site the samples were pre filtered 20 ml 0 45 µm for arsenic cadmium copper zinc lead while mercury samples were bottled unfiltered in a stabilizing solution of nitric acid and potassium dichromate 2 3 scaling concentrations for toxicity concentrations of pesticides and trace elements were converted to invertebrate toxicity by calculating toxic units tus where measured substance concentrations are normalized to their respective lc50 in acute standard laboratory test systems sprague 1969 these lc50 values were derived from daphnia magna or chironomus sp whose acute sensitivity when considering a wide range of organic toxicants is approximately equal or slightly less than the acute sensitivity of many insects morrissey et al 2015 von der ohe and liess 2004 for the tu calculation the lc50 of the most sensitive species was considered and retrieved from the pesticide property data base ppdb and in few cases the us epa ecotoxicology knowledgebase if the ppdb lacked respective data see tab si 3 lewis et al 2016 in case no experimental data was available 0 of target analytes 57 of non target analyte lc50 values mostly urban contaminants also including rubber additives as street runoff indicators quantitative structure activity relationship qsar derived effect concentrations were used to estimate tus busch et al 2016 pesticide peak exposure tumax in streams toxic to invertebrates was determined by the maximum single substance insecticidal toxicity measured liess and von der ohe 2005 tumax see tab si 1 extending this calculation method we identified that exceptionally toxic samples that are highly unusual in the exposure profile of the respective stream did not reflect the ecological situation spearpesticides and were therefore not considered in the tumax calculation these exceptional exposure peaks encountered in 20 of streams n 20 were defined by a tumax exceeding the mean tumax of the five subsequent samples ranked by tumax by a factor of more than 100 an inclusion of exceptionally high single pulses led to a weaker correlation between the toxic pressure and the ecological effect on vulnerable species spearpesticides r2 0 34 versus r2 0 43 with and without high pulses considered the authors are not aware of studies that have identified the reduced significance of an exceptionally high toxicant pulse compared to many significantly lower pulses in contrast the great ecotoxicological significance of several successive toxicity pulses was recognized the culmination of low dose pesticide effects liess et al 2013 analogously the typical peak pesticide mixture toxicity tusum was determined by summing all individual substance tus detected in a sample to assess regulatory thresholds pesticide concentrations were also scaled by the racs instead of the lc50 values see si chapter 11 the toxicity of urban toxicants was determined in the same way as for pesticides see tab si 4 the toxicity of trace elements was calculated using literature lc50 values liess et al 2017 tsui and wang 2005 see tab si 3 here the local maximum of summed tus tusum including all trace elements per sample is considered in the multiple linear regression 2 4 further abiotic parameters ortho phosphate nitrate nitrite and ammonium concentrations were determined in all grab and eds samples using either colorimetric tests by visicolor mcolortest merck kgaa darmstadt germany or a uv spectrophotometer pf 12 and visocolor eco tests machery nagel düren germany in 2018 and a uv

quantifying all hydromorphological criterions required under the wfd these include amongst others meandering of the watercourse variation in stream depth and width as well as riparian conditions

particulate organic matter plants debris and stones 2 mm in the stream bed see si chapter 2 for site specific data and variable aggregation 2 5 invertebrate sampling benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled at the beginning of june towards the end of the main pesticide application period for most crops and therefore suitable for ecological effect identification liess and von der ohe 2005 si invertebrate list standardized multi habitat sampling meier et al 2006 as prescribed under the wfd ensured comparable observations a 50 m long section of each stream was divided into its substrate

net with a surface of 0 0625 m2 and a mesh size 0 5 mm sampled organisms were separated the from coarse organic debris using a column sieve set preserved in 90 ethanol and later determined in the laboratory generally down to the lowest taxonomic level possible under the binocular the invertebrate determination level abundance and occurrence at sampling sites is provided in the si chapter 8 2 6 biological metrics of invertebrates we applied a wide range of biological indicator systems to assess the ecological effects of the stressors measured some of the invertebrate based indicators selected were developed to unspecifically respond to stressors these are taxa number number of insect taxa insect and ept biomass estimated using average taxa body volumes approximated by simple

kloiber and hering 2015 usseglio polatera et al 2000 as indicators responding to specific stressors we included the spearpesticides liess and von der ohe 2005 index that relates to the toxic pressure

kolkwitz and marsson 1909 rolauffs et al 2013 we defined the desired ecological status related to pesticides as for other invertebrate metrics under the wfd with 4 boundaries separating the 5 even quality classes equal eqr ecological quality ratio values of 0 8 0 6 0 4 and 0 2 eu commission 2008 and classified the resulting ecological status into the usual 5 quality classes ranging from high to bad related to spearpesticides for details of approach and classes see si chapter 9 2 7 statistical analyses all statistical analyses were performed with the statistical software r version 3 6 1 r core team 2019 multiple linear regression was performed with all predictors for each of the above listed biological metrics of invertebrates these include pesticide pressure dissolved oxygen hydromorphology bed habitat structure ph ortho phosphate nitrate nitrite ammonium total phosphorus total nitrogen flow velocity temperature rubber additive concentration discharge urban toxicity metal toxicity stream width and stream depth see tab si 1 all predictors were checked for homoscedasticity and normality some of which were log transformed if necessary different aggregations for individual predictors were investigated to explain all biological indicators by single linear regressions those yielding highest coefficients of determinations compared to other aggregations were chosen details see si chapter 2 if parameters were only available for a subset of streams rubber additive concentration discharge and urban contaminants toxicity regression analyses was reduced to the respective stream section subset intercorrelation of environmental parameters was tested using the variance inflation factor vif parameters with vif scores greater than two were omitted the selection of the total model was carried out by an automated forward model selection analysis and the akaike information criterion stepaic r package mass venables and ripley 2002 the total model is composed of significant parameters only and the explained variance is given by the adjusted r² the contribution of each significant parameter to the total explained variance was evaluated with the metric approach lmg which uses r² for the evaluation hierarchical partitioning chevan and sutherland 1991 r package relaimpo grömping 2006 the visualisation of the data and linear regression models were performed in r using ggplot2 wickham 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 assessment of anthropogenic stressors 3 1 1 determining relevant anthropogenic stressors the 101 streams selected are a representative cross section of small lowland streams in central europe see si chapter 1 they cover a wide gradient of agricultural pollution include 11 small wastewater treatment plants wwtps with less than 3000 population equivalents and a number of diffuse domestic discharges identified by wastewater markers we used multiple linear regression to identify those anthropogenic stressors that determine invertebrate community composition see si chapter 3 for stressor distribution chapter 8 for invertebrates sampled stressors with the highest explanatory power were i pesticide toxic pressure during exposure peaks ii oxygen deficiency and iii poor hydromorphology fig 1 stressors showing no or only minor associations with invertebrate related endpoints include urban toxicants such as pharmaceuticals heavy metals and street run off agricultural pesticides related to the substance of the peak exposure events with the highest exposure to effect concentration ratio the tumax maximum tu were on average 91 times more toxic than urban contaminants related to the sum of all toxicants tusum 76 times more toxic we also found that tus measured at 11 stream sections with wwtps were similar to those without wwtps si chapter 7 comparable to a study related to wwtp in switzerland munz et al 2017 agricultural nonpoint source pesticide pollution was thus identified as a major driver of invertebrate community composition in the ecosystems under investigation see chapter 3 3 2 on the ecological processes of the low concentration effects of pesticides non additive interactions between stressors were investigated limited to relevant stressor combinations so as not to reduce statistical power these were interactions between those stressors already known to act synergistically toxicants and water temperature arambourou and stoks 2015 verheyen and stoks 2020 and oxygen deficiency ferreira et al 2008 gupta et al 1983 van der geest et al 2002 we also added the remaining stressor that proved to be relevant for many of the ecological endpoints the deficiency of morphological structure interactions between these three stressor combinations were all additive none resulted in measurable antagonistic and synergistic ecological effects other investigations yielded comparable results for the minor relevance of interactions birk et al 2020 gieswein et al 2017 explaining them with community adaptation processes which reduce non additive stressor interactions romero et al 2019 3 1 2 assessment of ecological endpoints ecological endpoints best responding to the measured anthropogenic stressors were i the spearpesticides index identifying the degradation of invertebrate communities by pesticide toxicity liess and von der ohe 2005 ii the proportion of vulnerable insects ept ephemeroptera plecoptera trichoptera identifying the general degradation of the community lenat 1988 and iii the saprobic index identifying the oxygen deficiency kolkwitz and marsson 1909 fig 1 other common indicators of community disturbance were only marginally associated with any of the anthropogenic stressors quantified namely the bmwp and aspt armitage et al 1983 also the ecological status class esc for the biological quality element invertebrates under the eu water framework directive wfd völker et al 2016 seems unable to reflect anthropogenic stressor effects in small lowland streams an extended list of endpoints and their association to stressors is displayed in fig 1 our results show that indicators of function were only marginally associated with any of the anthropogenic stressors quantified these include invertebrate biomass taxa number and also diversity indices as functional richness evenness and divergence mason et al 2005 similar results were revealed for other small lowland streams voß and schäfer 2017 the weak association of anthropogenic stressors and several indicators of function is likely due to compensatory processes frost et al 1995 obviously such integrating endpoints that describe a system in its entirety i e total abundance or biomass are subject to compensatory processes and therefore respond less to stressors compared to differentiating endpoints liess and foit 2010 the loss of sensitive species may be compensated through tolerant species dornelas et al 2019 accordingly differentiating endpoints that include structural community measures and can reflect declines of the fraction of vulnerable taxa increased by competitive processes between taxa liess et al 2013 show strong associations with stressors these measures describe biological systems by grouping its elements individuals and populations according to contrasting traits liess and foit 2010 examples are the endpoints spearpesticides ept and the saprobic index that differentiate community composition according to the vulnerability of taxa towards pesticides general stressors or oxygen depletion it follows that measures describing the community without reference to competitive processes the integrating endpoints such as total invertebrate biomass taxa number and the shannon index are not capable of indicating anthropogenic stress it is precisely the exclusive use of integrating endpoints that carries the risk of overlooking actual stressor effects and signs of ecological degradation one example is a recent comprehensive meta study that reported an increase in freshwater insect abundances over the last decades based only on integrating endpoints klink et al 2020 accordingly total biodiversity without reference to contrasting traits such as size longevity or sensitivity may not be a sensitive indicator of global change 3 1 3 characterization of the agricultural pesticide pollution in terms of pesticide toxic pressure regular grab samples mainly taken during base flow conditions revealed a background contamination with an average of 17 detected pesticides and 10 pesticide metabolites per sample whereas event driven sampling eds revealed an increased average of 31 pesticides and 11 metabolites per sample pesticide concentrations 95 percentiles sampled by eds events exceeded grab sample derived background concentrations by a factor of 54 on averaging with a median of 6 3 a detailed overview of the detected pesticides and their concentrations is reported in the si chapter 4 pesticides contributing dominantly to the toxic pressure of peak events on invertebrates included the neonicotinoids thiacloprid mean share of tusum 46 6 imidacloprid 9 5 and clothianidin 3 6 as well as the biocide fipronil 9 9 and the carbamates methiocarb 5 1 and pirimicarb 4 8 these 6 pesticides drove the invertebrate toxicity in 91 3 of the peak exposure events when considering the pesticide with the highest exposure to effect concentration ratio the tumax on average tumax accounted for 69 of the invertebrate mixture toxicity assuming concentration addition tusum accordingly we show that the pesticide causing the highest toxic pressure out of the complex mixture of numerous pesticides is a good proxy of the total toxic pressure from a peak event this was also confirmed by the linear regression depicted in fig 3a which showed no improved association between the toxic pressure and spearpesticides when using tusum instead of tumax both r2 0 43 this finding matches previous studies which compared the relevance of the dominant compound to the mixture for the environmental impact of pesticides in agricultural streams knillmann et al 2018 liess and von der ohe 2005 schäfer et al 2007 here it is necessary to recognize that the dominant compound in each event can be a different one several such pesticide peak exposure pulses with at least a tenth of the tumax occurred on average 3 7 times per site and sampling period 3 2 current risk assessment underestimates exposure and effects of pesticides 3 2 1 exceedances of regulatory acceptable concentrations racs the authorisation of a pesticide requires that its application results in an environmental exposure below the safe level for non target organisms within the ecosystem efsa 2013 exposure models are applied to derive predicted environmental concentrations pec the level of exposure considered to be safe is determined in a tiered approach identifying regulatory acceptable concentrations rac for each pesticide our monitoring based findings show that these regulatory requirements pec rac are often not met in reality the measured environmental concentration mec was higher than the predicted environmental concentrations mec pec fig 2 b for 11 out of 16 pesticides that frequently exceeded racs selection see tab si 2 we observed pecs being exceeded in more than 1 of eds samples fig 2b the racs in place during the monitoring were exceeded in the majority of streams fig 2a even pesticides no longer approved at the time of the investigation 2018 2019 were present in concentrations above their rac si tab 2 at least one exceedance of a rac was detected in the 81 of sites in catchments with agricultural land use exceeding 20 fig 2a more than 5 rac exceedances within one sampling period were identified in 41 of agricultural streams eds with a total n 296 from agricultural streams revealed rac exceedances in 59 grab samples with a total n 440 in 26 of samples this is similar to the results obtained by the most comprehensive meta study to date which found that 45 of the 1566 cases of measured insecticide concentrations in eu surface waters exceeded their respective racs stehle and schulz 2015 on the substance level 37 pesticides and 2 metabolites exceeded their rac fig 2b for the 20 pesticides with most exceedances tab si 2 for all substances moreover in this current investigation we identified 41 of the 17 streams with less than 20 of agricultural land use where racs were still exceeded 4 out of 7 streams without any agriculture or known point sources within their catchment showed rac exceedances of 3 pesticides imidacloprid clothianidin fipronil see fig si 4a from the 7 sites within nature conservation areas 4 sites show rac exceedances 5 sites show acfield exceedances explanation see 3 3 1 data table si 1 fig si 4 although the authorisation of spray applications for 3 neonicotinoids had already expired in 2019 similar high exceedances as in 2018 were measured clothianidin imidacloprid thiamethoxam 3 2 2 reasons for non compliance with regulatory thresholds for the 20 pesticides that most frequently exceeded the racs the following potential reasons for non compliance with the regulatory thresholds were identified fig 2b and si chapter 4 i for 11 of these pesticides pecs were exceeded possibly either due to unauthorised application rates faulty exposure modelling failure to consider multiple applications in the river basin or overestimation of the predicted effectiveness of risk reduction measures thiacloprid terbuthylazin nicosulfuron lenacil diflufenican thiamethoxam s metolachlor foramsulfuron dimethenamid p pirimicarb mesotrione ii due to regulatory updated effect information the rac has been lowered for 8 pesticides after approval of available products however this updated information did not have an impact on the authorised products already on the market this leads to the situation that products are available for use even if the expected pec is above the updated rac and an authorisation would not have been granted eu commission 2011 however due to the inertia of the risk assessment practice where re evaluation is generally intended only every 10 to 15 years this incorporation of new knowledge had not been performed for several products containing the pesticides thiacloprid clothianidin methiocarb imidacloprid thiamethoxam acetamiprid dimoxystrobin and bromoxynil iii the measured environmental concentrations of 2 pesticides exceed their rac without having a pec assigned as authorisation assumed that there is no discharge into streams for methiocarb no pec run off was modelled due to the exclusive use as seed treatment although this assumption has proven wrong years ago the new assessment practice in place did not have an impact on authorized products already on the market fipronil on the other hand is only approved for biocidal and veterinary use and therefore has no pec for agricultural use assigned 3 2 3 contradiction to the pesticide regulation and the water framework directive wfd the environmental situation as revealed in the current investigation related to agricultural streams shows an impairment of vulnerable populations represented by a reduction of the spearpesticides index this situation does not comply with the regulation eu 546 2011 that states member states shall ensure that use of plant protection products does not have any long term repercussions for the abundance and diversity of non target species eu commission 2011 this also contradicts the requirements of the eu regulation 1107 2009 that pesticides must not exert unacceptable effects on the environment considering particularly contamination of surface waters with regards to non target species and impact on biodiversity and the ecosystem eu parliament 2009 as required by the european parliament no authorization to pesticides shall be granted unless it is clearly established through an appropriate risk assessment that under field conditions no unacceptable impact on the viability of exposed species occurs eu commission 2011 whereas unacceptability is defined within the specific protection goal for the ecological threshold option as negligible population level effects on the most sensitive populations the term negligible is used since it is difficult to demonstrate that no effect is occurring efsa 2013 furthermore the responsible authorities themselves are questioning the extent to which these environmental protection requirements are being implemented in practice for example the european court of auditors noted limited progress in measuring and reducing risks of plant protection products european court of auditors 2020 furthermore the german federal environment agency uba criticizes the current intensity of chemical plant protection in germany as ecologically unsustainable and thus threatening the achievement of key targets of environmental protection and nature conservation policies frische et al 2018 the water framework directive wfd also requires a good chemical status of water bodies by not exceeding environmental quality standards eqs the respective exceedances of these thresholds point a similar picture see si chapter 10 and si table 2 3 3 deriving protective thresholds for pesticides 3 3 1 deriving the acceptable concentration acfield the extensive dataset generated here allows to identify field based safe concentrations at which no unacceptable adverse ecological effects on invertebrate communities are expected the field validated acceptable concentration acfield for the first time this enables a validation of regulatory effect thresholds the acfield is based on 3 components i the indicator system spearpesticides ii an identification of the desired ecological status related to pesticides iii the quantification of the uncertainty of the exposure effect relationship i as a specific biological indicator we applied the spearpesticides index that uses pesticide specific traits pesticide sensitivity generation time migration ability presence during the time of contamination characterising the aquatic invertebrate community to establish a link between test system based toxicity lc50 d magna c riparius and ecological impact liess and von der ohe 2005 the index responds primarily to toxic pressure and is largely independent of other environmental factors as shown earlier knillmann et al 2018 liess et al 2008 and also here fig 1 the approach has been successfully applied in various geographical regions including europe knillmann et al 2018 schäfer et al 2012 australia burgert et al 2011 and south america hunt et al 2017 enabling a widespread adoption of the presented approach ii to define the ecological status related to pesticides we derived an eqr ecological quality ratio following the respective eu wfd procedure eu commission 2008 and as detailed within the methods section and the si chapter 9 the respective quality classes are indicated in fig 3 a where the boundary between a good and moderate status was set to a spearpesticides value of 0 6 resulting in 83 of agricultural streams that did not reach the pesticide related ecological targets iii the uncertainty of the exposure effect relationship is quantified by the variance of the relationship fig 3a causes for this variance are likely to include site specific environmental factors and their interaction with pesticides as well as inaccurate exposure and effect assessment the linear regression between toxic pressure tumax and community response spearpesticides intersects the transition between the good and moderate quality class at a log tumax of 3 27 identifying the threshold where 50 of sites below the regression line fail to meet a good ecological quality for invertebrates fig 3a to establish a reliable ecosystem based exposure effect relationship we assume that all the variance observed is not related to the effects of pesticides but to other factors this approach will considerably underestimate the true impact of pesticides accordingly the spearpesticides benchmark for an acceptable ecological status is reduced by the variance observed and should therefore be considered a conservative indicator of pesticide exposure 1 645σ corresponding to a one sided confidence level of 95 see fig 3a line a thus a log tumax of 3 27 marks the toxic pressure at which only 5 of sites will show an unacceptable spearpesticides with a 95 confidence level fig 3a b line b5 with this framework we consider the pesticide effects and as well as the related variability existing in the field and transform an adaptive cause effect relationship of toxic pressure spearpesticides into a benchmark related ecological cause effect relationship 95 of streams protected termed the acfield accordingly the threshold value for a pesticide that adversely affects invertebrates equals the substance specific acute lc50 divided by an extrapolation factor of about 2000 acfield see tab si 2 this measure describes the typical short term exposure of primarily invertebrate toxic pesticides at which no adverse effect on the invertebrate community is expected in 95 of the streams the relationship displayed in figure 3b additionally allows to identify the toxic pressure of a pesticide that relates to any percentage of streams affected the approach presented here is based on the assumption that the extrapolation factor from the laboratory based lc50 to the field effect is similar for all pesticides only then is it possible to include all peak loads to derive a common extrapolation factor regardless of the dominant pesticide in a given mixture the exceptionally good association between toxic pressure tu and invertebrate response spearpesticides in an ecological context shows that this assumption can obviously be made furthermore pesticides that do not cause the highest toxicity are also contributing to the overall ecological impact as for other environmental factors for the ecological assessment they are considered as a constant effect determining factor that is included in the extrapolation factor the good correlation identified in fig 3a indicates that these assumptions are valid for the majority of the pesticides investigated nevertheless significant deviations from this rule may occur in individual cases so that the acfield values are merely an indication of the ecological potency of a toxicant with this restriction in mind a prospective assessment of the ecosystem impact of new pesticides is possible accordingly this approach integrates prior knowledge into the derivation of ecologically effective concentrations in a similar way as other studies have based the probability of occurrence of taxa on habitat suitability vermeiren et al 2020 and toxicant concentration liess and von der ohe 2005 the acfield allows an effect assessment for a pesticide on the basis of the other pesticides typically present in agricultural streams therefore the acfield can only be compared with the rac when considering that rac values were derived without taking into account the presence of other pesticides the acfield that is available for 22 primarily invertebrate toxic pesticides identifies an extrapolation factor related to acute lc50 values of about 2000 protecting 95 of streams a factor exceeding the acute regulatory tier 1 assessment factor 100 by 20 to protect 99 of streams the respective extrapolation factor would amount to 18 000 a log tumax of 4 25 fig 3b however the exposure to rac ratio was found to explain spearpesticides equally well as the exposure to lc50 ratio r2 0 44 versus r2 0 43 see fig si 8a this shows that the rac values are related to the ecological effect as shown in the cause effect relationship in fig si 8a nonetheless their compliance would cause unacceptable effects in 14 of agricultural stream sections 86 would be protected fig si 8b to protect 95 or 99 of streams respectively the rac for invertebrate toxicity driving pesticides si chapter 11 required an additional assessment factor of 5 3 or 40 2 it must to be taken into account that these results refer primarily to the pesticides with the greatest rac exceedances these include particularly 4 different neonicotinoids as well as fipronil methiocarb and terbuthylazine fig si 4 3 3 2 mechanisms for the observed low concentration effects of pesticides we hypothesize the following ecological processes as the reason for the high field sensitivity of vulnerable species and the associated increased extrapolation factor identified here i the multitude of pesticides present in the streams may not only result in additive effects loewe and muischnek 1926 but also in a synergistic increase of pesticide toxicity due to the presence of additional toxicants that may exceed the additive effects by a factor of up to 660 as identified in laboratory investigations liess et al 2020 or by an increase of single substance toxicity by more than one order of magnitude as identified in field investigations rydh stenström et al 2021 ii environmental stressors may act synergistically when they occur together examples include the combined effects of nutrients suspensions and temperature frequently producing synergistic effects on abundance at the population level of periphyton communities piggott et al 2015 and the combined effects of nutrients suspensions and chloride inducing invertebrate drift in streamside mesocosms beermann et al 2018 additionally stressors such as predator pressure competition and suboptimal environmental conditions may increase the sensitivity of populations to pesticides by a factor of up to 100 as revealed in microcosm liess et al 2016 and mesocosm studies liess and beketov 2011 iii repeated insecticide pulses leading to multiple exposure of individuals within a generation within a spray season for annual species increases the impact compared to a single insecticide pulse wiberg larsen et al 2021 also repeated pesticide pulses leading to multiple exposure of populations between generations between spray seasons for annual species increases the impact compared to a single insecticide pulse and may result in a multigenerational culmination of low concentration effects liess et al 2013 the effect determining factors and their related processes described here are generally not considered in the aquatic risk assessment thus neither for individual based lower tier studies nor for mesocosm based higher tier studies effect determining factors are taken into account that are comparable in their expression with the field calibration of existing assessment factors by means of traditional higher tier studies has been successfully carried out brock et al 2016 rico et al 2019 but does not allow prediction of pesticide effects in the field we therefore suggest to calibrate the assessment factors applied in pesticide regulation integrating field based findings for example a relevant candidate for such an exercise is the insecticide chlorantraniliprole a pesticide that may replace the widely used neonicotinoids and could therefore gain high relevance in the near future schmidt jeffris and nault 2016 for chlorantraniliprole the rac is a factor of 50 higher than the respective acfield accordingly regular authorities could review the derivation of the current rac in order to avoid future environmental problems with this pesticide conclusions in this study of 101 small lowland stream sections we revealed for the first time the prime relevance of agricultural pesticide pressure for the composition of invertebrate communities the diversity and number of vulnerable species was already reduced at very low pesticide concentrations so that most of agricultural streams and even sites in nature conservation areas did not meet the pesticide related ecological targets we revealed that the current authorisation of pesticides underestimates the actual ecological risk as measured pesticide concentrations exceeded current regulatory threshold levels in most of the agricultural streams in addition existing thresholds were not protective for invertebrates by including monitoring derived information on pesticide effects within the ecosystem we identified pesticide threshold concentrations that will ensure an approprate protection of the invertebrate stream community future research should extend this concept developed in this study to other groups of aquatic organisms such as amphibians fish plant and fungi communities and also to terrestrial ecosystems this identification of field validated acceptable concentrations for the ecosystem ac field can then be used to review the existing thresholds of the pesticide risk assessment rac and the water framework directive mac eqs additional resources

16853,despite elaborate regulation of agricultural pesticides their occurrence in non target areas has been linked to adverse ecological effects on insects in several field investigations their quantitative role in contributing to the biodiversity crisis is however still not known in a large scale study across 101 sites of small lowland streams in central europe germany we revealed that 83 of agricultural streams did not meet the pesticide related ecological targets for the first time we identified that agricultural nonpoint source pesticide pollution was the major driver in reducing vulnerable insect populations in aquatic invertebrate communities exceeding the relevance of other anthropogenic stressors such as poor hydro morphological structure and nutrients we identified that the current authorisation of pesticides which aims to prevent unacceptable adverse effects underestimates the actual ecological risk as i measured pesticide concentrations exceeded current regulatory acceptable concentrations in 81 of the agricultural streams investigated ii for several pesticides the inertia of the authorisation process impedes the incorporation of new scientific knowledge and iii existing thresholds of invertebrate toxicity drivers are not protective by a factor of 5 3 to 40 to provide adequate environmental quality objectives the authorisation process needs to include monitoring derived information on pesticide effects at the ecosystem level here we derive such thresholds that ensure a protection of the invertebrate stream community graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biodiversity crisis multiple stressors agricultural pesticides ecosystem monitoring pesticide regulation 1 introduction the ongoing biodiversity crisis is caused by a variety of anthropogenic stressors including pesticides european environmental agency 2015 however great uncertainty remains about the respective contribution of various stressors to ecosystem degradation this debate also relates to agricultural pesticides as some investigations have identified strong impacts of nonpoint source pesticide pollution on streams in australia beketov et al 2013 europe beketov et al 2013 liess and von der ohe 2005 north america chiu et al 2016 and south america hunt et al 2017 while others only identified comparatively low impacts of pesticides noges et al 2016 accordingly the question remains how severe the effects of pesticides are compared to other stressors and more specifically at which concentrations ecosystem effects occur and which species and functional parameters are affected only with this knowledge it is possible to prioritize and manage environmental stressors effectively the regulatory authorisation of agricultural pesticides is supposed to prevent unacceptable effects in the environment for example in australia the eu and the us an extensive test system based assessment scheme to protect communities in non target aquatic ecosystems has been established australian environment agency 2009 efsa 2013 us goverment 2004 this regulatory framework is based on the concept of scaling the effects of individual pesticides in single species test systems or model ecosystems to the effect in the ecosystem on this basis pesticide concentrations are determined at which damage to aquatic communities can be excluded however the combined effects of natural and anthropogenic stressors present in the ecosystem are not systematically included nor has there been any validation of the prediction of ecosystem effects to date in this investigation we therefore performed a monitoring in a large geographical area that allows us to quantify all relevant anthropogenic stressors with high temporal resolution additionally we identified the stream invertebrate community as a measure of ecological quality on this basis we aimed i to model the relative contribution of environmental variables determining the occurrence of aquatic invertebrates and to attribute measured pesticide pressure to ecological status ii to evaluate the protectivity of the aquatic pesticide risk assessment and iii to derive evidence based thresholds for the effects of pesticides considering the presence of additional stressors relevant to the ecosystem 2 materials and methods 2 1 site selection a total of 101 stream sections distributed over germany were sampled in april and july for 2018 and 2019 see map in si fig 1 11 sites were monitored both years the initial selection comprised 124 stream sections however we omitted those stream sections that were affected by drought lack of flow drying out or where the automatic rain event driven samplers eds did not function eds si chapter 3 the catchment areas of the monitoring sites were characterized by a gradient of agricultural land use agricultural land cover in hydrological catchment 0 100 and less than 5 of urban areas to focus on agricultural diffuse source pollution 86 streams were located in agricultural environments agricultural land cover in hydrological catchment 20 referred to as agricultural streams whereas 15 streams were located in areas with less agricultural influence agricultural land cover in catchment 20 see si chapter 1 for land use analyses catchment sizes were generally below 30 km² to represent small lowland streams where those with a catchment greater than 10 km2 n 60 correspond to the reporting requirements of the wfd commision 2000 stream sections with a catchment size of less than 10 km2 n 41 corresponding to the edge of field surface waters of the eu efsa risk assessment of plant protection products for aquatic organisms efsa 2013 detailed site characteristics are listed in tab si 1 2 2 water sampling and chemical analyses streams were sampled from april to july in 2018 and 2019 during the main application period of pesticides in spring and early summer for most crops szöcs et al 2017 during this time period grab samples n 520 were taken regularly in a three week cycle this sampling method followed the monthly sampling in governmental monitoring practices under the wfd regardless of weather conditions eds samples n 320 were taken with automated maxx tp5 rangendingen germany and bottle samplers liess and von der ohe 2005 in order to capture runoff induced exposure peaks associated with heavy rainfall liess et al 1999 see fig si 5 small streams with agricultural catchment area are subject to short term water level rise liess and von der ohe 2005 with the occurrence of storm events exceeding approximately 10 mm d schulz et al 1998 eds sampling for a duration of 3 hours and 20 minutes was triggered by a rise of water level of more than 5 cm so that waves did not trigger the sampling and every runoff event could be captured further details see si chapter 3 the samples were cooled to 4 c in the sampler until they were transported to the laboratory after a maximum of 48 h the total of 840 samples of both field campaigns 2018 n 411 and 2019 n 429 were analysed for pesticides trace elements and nutrients for pesticide analysis water samples were filtered and analysed via direct injection into lc ms ms without enrichment by multiple reaction monitoring reemtsma et al 2013 details see si chapter 4 the target analysis tested for 75 pesticides active substances and 33 pesticide metabolites pyrethroid insecticides and the herbicide glyphosate were not included due to analytical limitations the compound selection was established by prioritization according to active substance related sale quantities the consideration of current environmental quality standards eqs and the regulatory acceptable concentrations rac brinke et al 2017 see tab si 2 to test for further urban toxicants the samples of 2018 were additionally subjected to lchrms ms screening analytics details see si chapter 6 this screening analyses tested for 257 substances which were grouped into 16 compound classes including pharmaceuticals industrial chemicals rubber additives stimulants corrosion inhibitors plastic additives sweeteners biocides uv filters bitterns repellents per and polyfluorinated compounds food ingredients surfactants dyes and flame retardants see tab si 4 the concentrations of trace elements arsenic cadmium copper zinc lead mercury were analysed in water samples using agilent s icp ms 8000 triple quad at the site the samples were pre filtered 20 ml 0 45 µm for arsenic cadmium copper zinc lead while mercury samples were bottled unfiltered in a stabilizing solution of nitric acid and potassium dichromate 2 3 scaling concentrations for toxicity concentrations of pesticides and trace elements were converted to invertebrate toxicity by calculating toxic units tus where measured substance concentrations are normalized to their respective lc50 in acute standard laboratory test systems sprague 1969 these lc50 values were derived from daphnia magna or chironomus sp whose acute sensitivity when considering a wide range of organic toxicants is approximately equal or slightly less than the acute sensitivity of many insects morrissey et al 2015 von der ohe and liess 2004 for the tu calculation the lc50 of the most sensitive species was considered and retrieved from the pesticide property data base ppdb and in few cases the us epa ecotoxicology knowledgebase if the ppdb lacked respective data see tab si 3 lewis et al 2016 in case no experimental data was available 0 of target analytes 57 of non target analyte lc50 values mostly urban contaminants also including rubber additives as street runoff indicators quantitative structure activity relationship qsar derived effect concentrations were used to estimate tus busch et al 2016 pesticide peak exposure tumax in streams toxic to invertebrates was determined by the maximum single substance insecticidal toxicity measured liess and von der ohe 2005 tumax see tab si 1 extending this calculation method we identified that exceptionally toxic samples that are highly unusual in the exposure profile of the respective stream did not reflect the ecological situation spearpesticides and were therefore not considered in the tumax calculation these exceptional exposure peaks encountered in 20 of streams n 20 were defined by a tumax exceeding the mean tumax of the five subsequent samples ranked by tumax by a factor of more than 100 an inclusion of exceptionally high single pulses led to a weaker correlation between the toxic pressure and the ecological effect on vulnerable species spearpesticides r2 0 34 versus r2 0 43 with and without high pulses considered the authors are not aware of studies that have identified the reduced significance of an exceptionally high toxicant pulse compared to many significantly lower pulses in contrast the great ecotoxicological significance of several successive toxicity pulses was recognized the culmination of low dose pesticide effects liess et al 2013 analogously the typical peak pesticide mixture toxicity tusum was determined by summing all individual substance tus detected in a sample to assess regulatory thresholds pesticide concentrations were also scaled by the racs instead of the lc50 values see si chapter 11 the toxicity of urban toxicants was determined in the same way as for pesticides see tab si 4 the toxicity of trace elements was calculated using literature lc50 values liess et al 2017 tsui and wang 2005 see tab si 3 here the local maximum of summed tus tusum including all trace elements per sample is considered in the multiple linear regression 2 4 further abiotic parameters ortho phosphate nitrate nitrite and ammonium concentrations were determined in all grab and eds samples using either colorimetric tests by visicolor mcolortest merck kgaa darmstadt germany or a uv spectrophotometer pf 12 and visocolor eco tests machery nagel düren germany in 2018 and a uv

quantifying all hydromorphological criterions required under the wfd these include amongst others meandering of the watercourse variation in stream depth and width as well as riparian conditions commision 2000 additionally bed habitat structure described the presence of potential holding substrate for invertebrates gieswein et al 2017 this parameter represents the combined fraction of coarse particulate organic matter plants debris and stones 2 mm in the stream bed see si chapter 2 for site specific data and variable aggregation 2 5 invertebrate sampling benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled at the beginning of june towards the end of the main pesticide application period for most crops and therefore suitable for ecological effect identification liess and von der ohe 2005 si invertebrate list standardized multi habitat sampling meier et al 2006 as prescribed under the wfd ensured comparable observations a 50 m long section of each stream was divided into its substrate

laboratory generally down to the lowest taxonomic level possible under the binocular the invertebrate determination level abundance and occurrence at sampling sites is provided in the si chapter 8 2 6 biological metrics of invertebrates we applied a wide range of biological indicator systems to assess the ecological effects of the stressors measured some of the invertebrate based indicators selected were developed to unspecifically respond to stressors these are taxa number number of insect taxa insect and ept biomass estimated using average taxa body volumes approximated by simple geometries cylinder ellipsoid rotational ellipsoid or cone depending on taxon body shape and a density of 1 06 g ml smit et al 1993 shannon taxa diversity shannon and weaver 1949 proportion of ephemeroptera plecoptera and trichopteran lenat 1988 ecological status class esc as multimetric index applied under the wfd considering individual indicators for morphological structure organic pollution and acidification commision 2000 the biological monitoring working party bmwp index and the average score per taxon aspt indicating general water quality armitage et al 1983 the fauna index lorenz et al 2004 and the 3 functional diversity components richness divergence and evenness mason et al 2005 considering the traits body size feeding type locomotion and aquatic stages schmidt kloiber and hering 2015 usseglio polatera et al 2000 as indicators responding to specific stressors we included the spearpesticides liess and von der ohe 2005 index that relates to the toxic pressure of pesticides on invertebrates and can be calculated with an online tool https systemecology de indicate and the saprobic index related to the organic pollution that is linked to oxygen deficiency kolkwitz and marsson 1909 rolauffs et al 2013 we defined the desired ecological status related to pesticides as for other invertebrate metrics under the wfd with 4 boundaries separating the 5 even quality classes equal eqr ecological quality ratio values of 0 8 0 6 0 4 and 0 2 eu commission 2008 and classified the resulting ecological status into the usual 5 quality classes ranging from high to bad related to spearpesticides for details of approach and classes see si chapter 9 2 7 statistical analyses all statistical analyses were performed with the statistical software r version 3 6 1 r core team 2019 multiple linear regression was performed with all predictors for each of the above listed biological metrics of invertebrates these include pesticide pressure dissolved oxygen hydromorphology bed habitat structure ph ortho phosphate nitrate nitrite ammonium total phosphorus total nitrogen flow velocity temperature rubber additive concentration discharge urban toxicity metal toxicity stream width and stream depth see tab si 1 all predictors were checked for homoscedasticity and normality some of which were log transformed if necessary different aggregations for individual predictors were investigated to explain all biological indicators by single linear regressions those yielding highest coefficients of determinations compared to other aggregations were chosen details see si chapter 2 if parameters were only available for a subset of streams rubber additive concentration discharge and urban contaminants toxicity regression analyses was reduced to the respective stream section subset intercorrelation of environmental parameters was tested using the variance inflation factor vif parameters with vif scores greater than two were omitted the selection of the total model was carried out by an automated forward model selection analysis and the akaike information criterion stepaic r package mass venables and ripley 2002 the total model is composed of significant parameters only and the explained variance is given by the adjusted r² the contribution of each significant parameter to the total explained variance was evaluated with the metric approach lmg which uses r² for the evaluation hierarchical partitioning chevan and sutherland 1991 r package relaimpo grömping 2006 the visualisation of the data and linear regression models were performed in r using ggplot2 wickham 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 assessment of anthropogenic stressors 3 1 1 determining relevant anthropogenic stressors the 101 streams selected are a representative cross section of small lowland streams in central europe see si chapter 1 they cover a wide gradient of agricultural pollution include 11 small wastewater treatment plants wwtps with less than 3000 population equivalents and a number of diffuse domestic discharges identified by wastewater markers we used multiple linear regression to identify those anthropogenic stressors that determine invertebrate community composition see si chapter 3 for stressor distribution chapter 8 for invertebrates sampled stressors with the highest explanatory power were i pesticide toxic pressure during exposure peaks ii oxygen deficiency and iii poor hydromorphology fig 1 stressors showing no or only minor associations with invertebrate related endpoints include urban toxicants such as pharmaceuticals heavy metals and street run off agricultural pesticides related to the substance of the peak exposure events with the highest exposure to effect concentration ratio the tumax maximum tu were on average 91 times more toxic than urban contaminants related to the sum of all toxicants tusum 76 times more toxic we also found that tus measured at 11 stream sections with wwtps were similar to those without wwtps si chapter 7 comparable to a study related to wwtp in switzerland munz et al 2017 agricultural nonpoint source pesticide pollution was thus identified as a major driver of invertebrate community composition in the ecosystems under investigation see chapter 3 3 2 on the ecological processes of the low concentration effects of pesticides non additive interactions between stressors were investigated limited to relevant stressor combinations so as not to reduce statistical power these were interactions between those stressors already known to act synergistically toxicants and water temperature arambourou and stoks 2015 verheyen and stoks 2020 and oxygen deficiency ferreira et al 2008 gupta et al 1983 van der geest et al 2002 we also added the remaining stressor that proved to be relevant for many of the ecological endpoints the deficiency of morphological structure interactions between these three stressor combinations were all additive none resulted in measurable antagonistic and synergistic ecological effects other investigations yielded comparable results for the minor relevance of interactions birk et al 2020 gieswein et al 2017 explaining them with community adaptation processes which reduce non additive stressor interactions romero et al 2019 3 1 2 assessment of ecological endpoints ecological endpoints best responding to the measured anthropogenic stressors were i the spearpesticides index identifying the degradation of invertebrate communities by pesticide toxicity liess and von der ohe 2005 ii the proportion of vulnerable insects ept ephemeroptera plecoptera trichoptera identifying the general degradation of the community lenat 1988 and iii the saprobic index identifying the oxygen deficiency kolkwitz and marsson 1909 fig 1 other common indicators of community disturbance were only marginally associated with any of the anthropogenic stressors quantified namely the bmwp and aspt armitage et al 1983 also the ecological status class esc for the biological quality element invertebrates under the eu water framework directive wfd völker et al 2016 seems unable to reflect anthropogenic stressor effects in small lowland streams an extended list of endpoints and their association to stressors is displayed in fig 1 our results show that indicators of function were only marginally associated with any of the anthropogenic stressors quantified these include invertebrate biomass taxa number and also diversity indices as functional richness evenness and divergence mason et al 2005 similar results were revealed for other small lowland streams voß and schäfer 2017 the weak association of anthropogenic stressors and several indicators of function is likely due to compensatory processes frost et al 1995 obviously such integrating endpoints that describe a system in its entirety i e total abundance or biomass are subject to compensatory processes and therefore respond less to stressors compared to differentiating endpoints liess and foit 2010 the loss of sensitive species may be compensated through tolerant species dornelas et al 2019 accordingly differentiating endpoints that include structural community measures and can reflect declines of the fraction of vulnerable taxa increased by competitive processes between taxa liess et al 2013 show strong associations with stressors these measures describe biological systems by grouping its elements individuals and populations according to contrasting traits liess and foit 2010 examples are the endpoints spearpesticides ept and the saprobic index that differentiate community composition according to the vulnerability of taxa towards pesticides general stressors or oxygen depletion it follows that measures describing the community without reference to competitive processes the integrating endpoints such as total invertebrate biomass taxa number and the shannon index are not capable of indicating anthropogenic stress it is precisely the exclusive use of integrating endpoints that carries the risk of overlooking actual stressor effects and signs of ecological degradation one example is a recent comprehensive meta study that reported an increase in freshwater insect abundances over the last decades based only on integrating endpoints klink et al 2020 accordingly total biodiversity without reference to contrasting traits such as size longevity or sensitivity may not be a sensitive indicator of global change 3 1 3 characterization of the agricultural pesticide pollution in terms of pesticide toxic pressure regular grab samples mainly taken during base flow conditions revealed a background contamination with an average of 17 detected pesticides and 10 pesticide metabolites per sample whereas event driven sampling eds revealed an increased average of 31 pesticides and 11 metabolites per sample pesticide concentrations 95 percentiles sampled by eds events exceeded grab sample derived background concentrations by a factor of 54 on averaging with a median of 6 3 a detailed overview of the detected pesticides and their concentrations is reported in the si chapter 4 pesticides contributing dominantly to the toxic pressure of peak events on invertebrates included the neonicotinoids thiacloprid mean share of tusum 46 6 imidacloprid 9 5 and clothianidin 3 6 as well as the biocide fipronil 9 9 and the carbamates methiocarb 5 1 and pirimicarb 4 8 these 6 pesticides drove the invertebrate toxicity in 91 3 of the peak exposure events when considering the pesticide with the highest exposure to effect concentration ratio the tumax on average tumax accounted for 69 of the invertebrate mixture toxicity assuming concentration addition tusum accordingly we show that the pesticide causing the highest toxic pressure out of the complex mixture of numerous pesticides is a good proxy of the total toxic pressure from a peak event this was also confirmed by the linear regression depicted in fig 3a which showed no improved association between the toxic pressure and spearpesticides when using tusum instead of tumax both r2 0 43 this finding matches previous studies which compared the relevance of the dominant compound to the mixture for the environmental impact of pesticides in agricultural streams knillmann et al 2018 liess and von der ohe 2005 schäfer et al 2007 here it is necessary to recognize that the dominant compound in each event can be a different one several such pesticide peak exposure pulses with at least a tenth of the tumax occurred on average 3 7 times per site and sampling period 3 2 current risk assessment underestimates exposure and effects of pesticides 3 2 1 exceedances of regulatory acceptable concentrations racs the authorisation of a pesticide requires that its application results in an environmental exposure below the safe level for non target organisms within the ecosystem efsa 2013 exposure models are applied to derive predicted environmental concentrations pec the level of exposure considered to be safe is determined in a tiered approach identifying regulatory acceptable concentrations rac for each pesticide our monitoring based findings show that these regulatory requirements pec rac are often not met in reality the measured environmental concentration mec was higher than the predicted environmental concentrations mec pec fig 2 b for 11 out of 16 pesticides that frequently exceeded racs selection see tab si 2 we observed pecs being exceeded in more than 1 of eds samples fig 2b the racs in place during the monitoring were exceeded in the majority of streams fig 2a even pesticides no longer approved at the time of the investigation 2018 2019 were present in concentrations above their rac si tab 2 at least one exceedance of a rac was detected in the 81 of sites in catchments with agricultural land use exceeding 20 fig 2a more than 5 rac exceedances within one sampling period were identified in 41 of agricultural streams eds with a total n 296 from agricultural streams revealed rac exceedances in 59 grab samples with a total n 440 in 26 of samples this is similar to the results obtained by the most comprehensive meta study to date which found that 45 of the 1566 cases of measured insecticide concentrations in eu surface waters exceeded their respective racs stehle and schulz 2015 on the substance level 37 pesticides and 2 metabolites exceeded their rac fig 2b for the 20 pesticides with most exceedances tab si 2 for all substances moreover in this current investigation we identified 41 of the 17 streams with less than 20 of agricultural land use where racs were still exceeded 4 out of 7 streams without any agriculture or known point sources within their catchment showed rac exceedances of 3 pesticides imidacloprid clothianidin fipronil see fig si 4a from the 7 sites within nature conservation areas 4 sites show rac exceedances 5 sites show acfield exceedances explanation see 3 3 1 data table si 1 fig si 4 although the authorisation of spray applications for 3 neonicotinoids had already expired in 2019 similar high exceedances as in 2018 were measured clothianidin imidacloprid thiamethoxam 3 2 2 reasons for non compliance with regulatory thresholds for the 20 pesticides that most frequently exceeded the racs the following potential reasons for non compliance with the regulatory thresholds were identified fig 2b and si chapter 4 i for 11 of these pesticides pecs were exceeded possibly either due to unauthorised application rates faulty exposure modelling failure to consider multiple applications in the river basin or overestimation of the predicted effectiveness of risk reduction measures thiacloprid terbuthylazin nicosulfuron lenacil diflufenican thiamethoxam s metolachlor foramsulfuron dimethenamid p pirimicarb mesotrione ii due to regulatory updated effect information the rac has been lowered for 8 pesticides after approval of available products however this updated information did not have an impact on the authorised products already on the market this leads to the situation that products are available for use even if the expected pec is above the updated rac and an authorisation would not have been granted eu commission 2011 however due to the inertia of the risk assessment practice where re evaluation is generally intended only every 10 to 15 years this incorporation of new knowledge had not been performed for several products containing the pesticides thiacloprid clothianidin methiocarb imidacloprid thiamethoxam acetamiprid dimoxystrobin and bromoxynil iii the measured environmental concentrations of 2 pesticides exceed their rac without having a pec assigned as authorisation assumed that there is no discharge into streams for methiocarb no pec run off was modelled due to the exclusive use as seed treatment although this assumption has proven wrong years ago the new assessment practice in place did not have an impact on authorized products already on the market fipronil on the other hand is only approved for biocidal and veterinary use and therefore has no pec for agricultural use assigned 3 2 3 contradiction to the pesticide regulation and the water framework directive wfd the environmental situation as revealed in the current investigation related to agricultural streams shows an impairment of vulnerable populations represented by a reduction of the spearpesticides index this situation does not comply with the regulation eu 546 2011 that states member states shall ensure that use of plant protection products does not have any long term repercussions for the abundance and diversity of non target species eu commission 2011 this also contradicts the requirements of the eu regulation 1107 2009 that pesticides must not exert unacceptable effects on the environment considering particularly contamination of surface waters with regards to non target species and impact on biodiversity and the ecosystem eu parliament 2009 as required by the european parliament no authorization to pesticides shall be granted unless it is clearly established through an appropriate risk assessment that under field conditions no unacceptable impact on the viability of exposed species occurs eu commission 2011 whereas unacceptability is defined within the specific protection goal for the ecological threshold option as negligible population level effects on the most sensitive populations the term negligible is used since it is difficult to demonstrate that no effect is occurring efsa 2013 furthermore the responsible authorities themselves are questioning the extent to which these environmental protection requirements are being implemented in practice for example the european court of auditors noted limited progress in measuring and reducing risks of plant protection products european court of auditors 2020 furthermore the german federal environment agency uba criticizes the current intensity of chemical plant protection in germany as ecologically unsustainable and thus threatening the achievement of key targets of environmental protection and nature conservation policies frische et al 2018 the water framework directive wfd also requires a good chemical status of water bodies by not exceeding environmental quality standards eqs the respective exceedances of these thresholds point a similar picture see si chapter 10 and si table 2 3 3 deriving protective thresholds for pesticides 3 3 1 deriving the acceptable concentration acfield the extensive dataset generated here allows to identify field based safe concentrations at which no unacceptable adverse ecological effects on invertebrate communities are expected the field validated acceptable concentration acfield for the first time this enables a validation of regulatory effect thresholds the acfield is based on 3 components i the indicator system spearpesticides ii an identification of the desired ecological status related to pesticides iii the quantification of the uncertainty of the exposure effect relationship i as a specific biological indicator we applied the spearpesticides index that uses pesticide specific traits pesticide sensitivity generation time migration ability presence during the time of contamination characterising the aquatic invertebrate community to establish a link between test system based toxicity lc50 d magna c riparius and ecological impact liess and von der ohe 2005 the index responds primarily to toxic pressure and is largely independent of other environmental factors as shown earlier knillmann et al 2018 liess et al 2008 and also here fig 1 the approach has been successfully applied in various geographical regions including europe knillmann et al 2018 schäfer et al 2012 australia burgert et al 2011 and south america hunt et al 2017 enabling a widespread adoption of the presented approach ii to define the ecological status related to pesticides we derived an eqr ecological quality ratio following the respective eu wfd procedure eu commission 2008 and as detailed within the methods section and the si chapter 9 the respective quality classes are indicated in fig 3 a where the boundary between a good and moderate status was set to a spearpesticides value of 0 6 resulting in 83 of agricultural streams that did not reach the pesticide related ecological targets iii the uncertainty of the exposure effect relationship is quantified by the variance of the relationship fig 3a causes for this variance are likely to include site specific environmental factors and their interaction with pesticides as well as inaccurate exposure and effect assessment the linear regression between toxic pressure tumax and community response spearpesticides intersects the transition between the good and moderate quality class at a log tumax of 3 27 identifying the threshold where 50 of sites below the regression line fail to meet a good ecological quality for invertebrates fig 3a to establish a reliable ecosystem based exposure effect relationship we assume that all the variance observed is not related to the effects of pesticides but to other factors this approach will considerably underestimate the true impact of pesticides accordingly the spearpesticides benchmark for an acceptable ecological status is reduced by the variance observed and should therefore be considered a conservative indicator of pesticide exposure 1 645σ corresponding to a one sided confidence level of 95 see fig 3a line a thus a log tumax of 3 27 marks the toxic pressure at which only 5 of sites will show an unacceptable spearpesticides with a 95 confidence level fig 3a b line b5 with this framework we consider the pesticide effects and as well as the related variability existing in the field and transform an adaptive cause effect relationship of toxic pressure spearpesticides into a benchmark related ecological cause effect relationship 95 of streams protected termed the acfield accordingly the threshold value for a pesticide that adversely affects invertebrates equals the substance specific acute lc50 divided by an extrapolation factor of about 2000 acfield see tab si 2 this measure describes the typical short term exposure of primarily invertebrate toxic pesticides at which no adverse effect on the invertebrate community is expected in 95 of the streams the relationship displayed in figure 3b additionally allows to identify the toxic pressure of a pesticide that relates to any percentage of streams affected the approach presented here is based on the assumption that the extrapolation factor from the laboratory based lc50 to the field effect is similar for all pesticides only then is it possible to include all peak loads to derive a common extrapolation factor regardless of the dominant pesticide in a given mixture the exceptionally good association between toxic pressure tu and invertebrate response spearpesticides in an ecological context shows that this assumption can obviously be made furthermore pesticides that do not cause the highest toxicity are also contributing to the overall ecological impact as for other environmental factors for the ecological assessment they are considered as a constant effect determining factor that is included in the extrapolation factor the good correlation identified in fig 3a indicates that these assumptions are valid for the majority of the pesticides investigated nevertheless significant deviations from this rule may occur in individual cases so that the acfield values are merely an indication of the ecological potency of a toxicant with this restriction in mind a prospective assessment of the ecosystem impact of new pesticides is possible accordingly this approach integrates prior knowledge into the derivation of ecologically effective concentrations in a similar way as other studies have based the probability of occurrence of taxa on habitat suitability vermeiren et al 2020 and toxicant concentration liess and von der ohe 2005 the acfield allows an effect assessment for a pesticide on the basis of the other pesticides typically present in agricultural streams therefore the acfield can only be compared with the rac when considering that rac values were derived without taking into account the presence of other pesticides the acfield that is available for 22 primarily invertebrate toxic pesticides identifies an extrapolation factor related to acute lc50 values of about 2000 protecting 95 of streams a factor exceeding the acute regulatory tier 1 assessment factor 100 by 20 to protect 99 of streams the respective extrapolation factor would amount to 18 000 a log tumax of 4 25 fig 3b however the exposure to rac ratio was found to explain spearpesticides equally well as the exposure to lc50 ratio r2 0 44 versus r2 0 43 see fig si 8a this shows that the rac values are related to the ecological effect as shown in the cause effect relationship in fig si 8a nonetheless their compliance would cause unacceptable effects in 14 of agricultural stream sections 86 would be protected fig si 8b to protect 95 or 99 of streams respectively the rac for invertebrate toxicity driving pesticides si chapter 11 required an additional assessment factor of 5 3 or 40 2 it must to be taken into account that these results refer primarily to the pesticides with the greatest rac exceedances these include particularly 4 different neonicotinoids as well as fipronil methiocarb and terbuthylazine fig si 4 3 3 2 mechanisms for the observed low concentration effects of pesticides we hypothesize the following ecological processes as the reason for the high field sensitivity of vulnerable species and the associated increased extrapolation factor identified here i the multitude of pesticides present in the streams may not only result in additive effects loewe and muischnek 1926 but also in a synergistic increase of pesticide toxicity due to the presence of additional toxicants that may exceed the additive effects by a factor of up to 660 as identified in laboratory investigations liess et al 2020 or by an increase of single substance toxicity by more than one order of magnitude as identified in field investigations rydh stenström et al 2021 ii environmental stressors may act synergistically when they occur together examples include the combined effects of nutrients suspensions and temperature frequently producing synergistic effects on abundance at the population level of periphyton communities piggott et al 2015 and the combined effects of nutrients suspensions and chloride inducing invertebrate drift in streamside mesocosms beermann et al 2018 additionally stressors such as predator pressure competition and suboptimal environmental conditions may increase the sensitivity of populations to pesticides by a factor of up to 100 as revealed in microcosm liess et al 2016 and mesocosm studies liess and beketov 2011 iii repeated insecticide pulses leading to multiple exposure of individuals within a generation within a spray season for annual species increases the impact compared to a single insecticide pulse wiberg larsen et al 2021 also repeated pesticide pulses leading to multiple exposure of populations between generations between spray seasons for annual species increases the impact compared to a single insecticide pulse and may result in a multigenerational culmination of low concentration effects liess et al 2013 the effect determining factors and their related processes described here are generally not considered in the aquatic risk assessment thus neither for individual based lower tier studies nor for mesocosm based higher tier studies effect determining factors are taken into account that are comparable in their expression with the field calibration of existing assessment factors by means of traditional higher tier studies has been successfully carried out brock et al 2016 rico et al 2019 but does not allow prediction of pesticide effects in the field we therefore suggest to calibrate the assessment factors applied in pesticide regulation integrating field based findings for example a relevant candidate for such an exercise is the insecticide chlorantraniliprole a pesticide that may replace the widely used neonicotinoids and could therefore gain high relevance in the near future schmidt jeffris and nault 2016 for chlorantraniliprole the rac is a factor of 50 higher than the respective acfield accordingly regular authorities could review the derivation of the current rac in order to avoid future environmental problems with this pesticide conclusions in this study of 101 small lowland stream sections we revealed for the first time the prime relevance of agricultural pesticide pressure for the composition of invertebrate communities the diversity and number of vulnerable species was already reduced at very low pesticide concentrations so that most of agricultural streams and even sites in nature conservation areas did not meet the pesticide related ecological targets we revealed that the current authorisation of pesticides underestimates the actual ecological risk as measured pesticide concentrations exceeded current regulatory threshold levels in most of the agricultural streams in addition existing thresholds were not protective for invertebrates by including monitoring derived information on pesticide effects within the ecosystem we identified pesticide threshold concentrations that will ensure an approprate protection of the invertebrate stream community future research should extend this concept developed in this study to other groups of aquatic organisms such as amphibians fish plant and fungi communities and also to terrestrial ecosystems this identification of field validated acceptable concentrations for the ecosystem ac field can then be used to review the existing thresholds of the pesticide risk assessment rac and the water framework directive mac eqs additional resources

negatively charged substances is achieved by changing the potential periodically e g after 30 min to negative charge 2 5 v cell potential for this purpose sputter deposition of ultra thin gold layers 40 nm is used to generate electrically conductive gold polymer gold flat sheet membranes by coating the active and the support layer of two commercial polymer uf membranes polyethersulfone up150 polyamide m5 when m5 membrane was charged positively during filtration 2 5 v suwannee river nom hohloh lake nom humic acid and brilliant blue ionic dye showed removal rates of 70 75 and 93 and 99 respectively whereas when no potential was applied 0 v removal rates were only 1 5 when a positive potential was applied to the active membrane layer and a negative potential was applied to the support layer cell potential 2 5 v a significant increase of flux with 25 l m² h was observed due to the induction of electro osmosis electrosorption was only observed for m5 membrane ζ 13 mv ph 7 and not with up150 membrane ζ 29 mv ph 7 due to a low current density of 1 1 a m² at a flux of 100 l m² h the additional energy consumption of electrosorption and desorption process was low with 0 03 kwh per m³ of permeate this study delivered the proof of concept for the novel process of electrosorptive uf with energy consumption between microfiltration and ultrafiltration but nom removal rates of nanofiltration membranes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electrically conductive membrane electrosorption nom 1 introduction ultrafiltration uf is a promising technology for both the production of drinking water as well as the treatment of wastewater but suffers from the selectivity permeability trade off park et al 2017 with increasing selectivity the permeability decreases resulting in a higher specific energy demand in general conventional dead end uf is not capable to meet the growing demand of removing dissolved organic water constituents such as natural organic matter nom or organic micropollutants from feed water acero et al 2016 j winter et al 2017 for such separation tasks less energy efficient nanofiltration nf is applied s lee and lee 2007 a new approach to enhance the selectivity of uf membranes is the application of electrically conductive membranes ecms formoso et al 2017 research on ecms has undergone a strong increase in the recent years due the development of novel conductive membrane materials straub et al 2021 and promising results regarding the fouling and rejection behaviour of externally charged uf membranes when a cathodic potential is applied to the membrane surface dudchenko et al 2014 a repulsive electrostatic force is induced fig 1 a due to the negative membrane charge and the likewise negative charge of most dissolved organic compounds shao et al 2011 several studies showed this behaviour by using different types of ecms x zhu jassby 2019 the present study aims at breaking the permeability selectivity trade off by combining the processes of uf and electrosorption through application of a low positive anodic potential to the uf membrane negatively charged organic molecules are electrostatically attracted to the membrane surface and bond via electrosorption fig 1b in order to maintain a sustainable filtration process the electro adsorbed substances will be desorbed periodically by reversing the applied potential to negative bias for this purpose an intrinsically positively charged polyamide pa uf membrane is employed due to its ability to adsorb negatively charged substances even without an applied positive potential the pa membrane was made electrically conductive by gold duplex coating active and support layer with this method no additional counter electrode is necessary to apply an external potential mantel et al 2021 for future technical application gold could be substituted with cheaper conductive materials such as laser induced graphene or conductive nanoparticles sun et al 2021 in literature electrosorption of ions choi et al 2019 as well as charged dissolved organic molecules x su and hatton 2017 onto carbon electrodes is a well known and intensively investigated process in fact the technology of capacitive deionization cdi is based on similar mechanisms of electrosorption and desorption as proposed in the present study however cdi is mainly used for desalination porada et al 2013 and the presence of organic macromolecules may lead to fouling of the flow by carbon electrodes r chen et al 2020 in contrast to this electrosorptive uf is not targeting the removal of salts but of charged organic molecules for this the ecm serves as a flow through electrode and conventional uf membrane at the same time which provides a beneficial mass transfer vecitis et al 2011 several studies have already shown that electrosorption of organic macromolecules such as proteins htwe et al 2018 and inorganic colloids such as silica particles morrow et al 2007 occurs on plane conductive materials such as metals however the complete desorption of previously electrosorbed substances by reversal of the external potential is reported to be difficult tramis et al 2019 lately an electrically conductive carbon microfiltration mf membrane was developed that showed comparably high removal rates for nom compounds at positive potentials s chen et al 2020 however this study did not report data on electrodesorption and regeneration of the membrane to our best knowledge no other publication reports on such investigations the intention of the present study is presenting the proof of concept for the electrosorptive removal of dissolved organic water constituents with an electrically conductive uf membrane in order to gain a better understanding of this process different key parameters such as the impact of ionic strength ph intrinsic membrane charge and applied potential was studied furthermore different nom models as well as ionic dyes were employed as organic model substances in the feed solution eventually real surface water was tested including several electrosorption and electrodesorption cycles 2 material and methods 2 1 membrane preparation and characterization a hydrophilic and positively charged pa flat sheet membrane m5 with permeability between mf and uf was kindly supplied by i3 membrane gmbh germany the porous membrane was duplex coated with 40 nm of gold on the active and the support side fig 1 with a laboratory sputter coater scd 005 baltec lichtenstein mantel et al 2018 in this way no additional counter electrode was needed to apply an external potential to the membrane mantel et al 2021 active membrane area was 42 cm² and the membrane thickness equivalent to electrode distance was 0 14 mm the virgin and gold coated m5 membranes were characterized regarding pure water permeability zeta potential contact angle electrical surface conductivity brunauer emmett teller bet surface area scanning electron microscopy sem and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir bet surface area was measured with tristar asap 201 micromeritics instrument usa 0 2 g of the virgin and gold coated m5 was analyzed at a temperature of 77 k with nitrogen as analysis adsorptive ftir spectroscopy was conducted with alpha p from burker usa cyclic voltammetry was conducted with duplex coated m5 membrane and ag agcl reference electrode xylem analytics germany the working and counter electrode were the gold coated active and support layer of the same flat sheet membrane respectively the detailed procedure is explained in our previous study mantel et al 2021 electro osmosis was investigated at ph 7 and 1 mmol l 1 nacl in pure water for this the membrane was placed in the filtration cell and charged with anodic and cathodic cell potentials of 0 1 0 2 5 and 5 0 v fig s5 the feed pump was not operated in these experiments so that the fluid flow was only induced by the applied electrical field consequently electro osmotic flow was measured as the positive or negative permeate flow and pressure was determined by measuring the transmembrane pressure tmp mantel et al 2021 more information on up150 membrane and the characterization methods regarding pure water permeability zeta potential contact angle electrical surface conductivity and scanning electron microscopy sem can be found in our recent studies mantel et al 2018 mantel et al 2021 2 2 feed solutions 2 2 1 nom models and hohloh lake water three nom model solutions with different charge densities and aromaticity were chosen to investigate electrosorptive binding capacity of the m5 membrane tab 1 due to the deprotonated carboxylic and hydroxyl groups nom are charged negatively at neutral ph fig s1 gray et al 2007 charge density is given as total acidity which is defined as the sum of phenolic hydroxyl and carboxylic acidity benecke 2018 the aromaticity is measured with the suva which is defined as uv absorbance of a sample at 254 nm divided by the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration weishaar et al 2003 as a humic acid model sigma aldrich humic acids saha sigma aldrich usa was chosen to represent a mainly negative charged and highly aromatic nom substances in order to remove impurities such as fulvic acids saha was purified before use following a procedure explained in the reference tang et al 2007 suwanee river nom srnom model was chosen to represent the whole range of charged and uncharged nom spectra matilainen et al 2011 srnom was obtained from international humic substances society 2r101n ihss usa natural surface water with high nom content came from the hohloh lake hsnom the hohloh lake is in the boggy black forest baden württemberg germany and contains 23 5 mg l 1 of toc more detailed data of hohloh lake can be found in reference benecke 2018 prior to experiments hohloh lake water was diluted with pure water in a ratio of one to three to ensure equal doc concentrations for all nom model water ionic strengths and ph were adjusted by adding 1 mmol l nacl and by dosing naoh or hcl respectively all feed solutions were pre filtered with a 0 2 µm membrane in order to avoid particle fouling measurement of feed and permeate concentration was conducted via total organic carbon toc detection applying toc analyzer shimadzu toc l cph japan photometric evaluation of nom was determined at a wavelength of 254 nm for the detection of conjugated double bonds of the nom leenheer and croué 2003 as well as at 436 nm for the detection of typical yellow color of nom containing water schulz et al 2017 with a spectrophotometer dr5000 hach germany doc was obtained by toc measurement after removal of particles by filtration millipore membrane 0 45 µm in order to evaluate the size distribution of the removed nom liquid chromatography analysis lc ocd were conducted huber et al 2011 doc labor huber germany 2 2 2 ionic dye solutions as a representative of a negatively charged ionic dye molecule brilliant blue bb mw 793 g mol dye was chosen with a concentration of 3 5 mg l fig s2 the blue dye was photometrically measured at a wavelength of 629 nm the ionic strength of the dye feed was increased by dosing 1 mmol l nacl and ph was set to ph 7 by titration of 0 1 m naoh bb dye was obtained from sigma aldrich usa 2 3 experimental set up of filtration dead end filtration was carried out in a modified commercial filtration cell sterlitech cf042 usa fig 2 pressure was applied with a gear pump mcp z ismatech germany and regulated manually during the experiment to maintain a constant flux the pressure was measured before and after the filtration cell to calculate the tmp the filtration flux was determined with a digital balance pcb kern germany which was connected to a computer filtration experiments were conducted with direct current cell potentials of 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 v with anodic positive and cathodic negative membrane charge electrical potential was held constant and the current was measured with a potentiostat pgu ips elektroniklabor germany electrical connection into the membrane cell was accomplished through titanium foils fig s3 all filtration experiments were performed in triplicates to investigate the immediate impact of voltage application a flow through cuvette hellma 10 mm germany was placed beyond the membrane filtration cell in the permeate stream fig 2 extinction of uv vis at a certain wavelength 254 nm for nom 629 nm for bb dye was measured every four seconds to determine the adsorbed and desorbed mass flux was kept constant at 100 and 240 l m² h for nom and dye experiments respectively for calculation of adsorbed and desorbed nom and dye mass the uv vis peak areas were integrated following equation 1 where mads is the adsorbed mass v is volume of filtered water c0 is the initial concentration of the feed and c is the actual concentration measured during the experiment negative values of mads stand for adsorbed mass and positive values stand for desorbed mass 1 m a d s 0 v c 0 c d v 2 3 1 sorption capacity of uncharged vs externally charged m5 membrane to evaluate the intrinsic adsorption capacity of the positively charged m5 membrane filtration experiments with the pristine and fresh m5 membrane were conducted for this srnom and bb dye were used as feed solutions moreover the same experiment was carried out with the application of 2 5 v to compare to the breakthrough curves of srnom and bb dye of the uncharged and externally charged membranes at all following filtration experiments intrinsic adsorption capacity of the m5 membrane was fully saturated before the actual electrosorptive filtration experiment started in order to avoid interference 2 3 2 electrodesorption with external potential vs salt elution adsorbed charged substances can be desorbed from charged membranes by rinsing the membrane with high concentrations of salt solutions teepakorn et al 2015 at high nacl concentrations electrostatic forces are decreased and also ion exchange can take place yang et al 2002 membrane loading was achieved by dead end filtration of the srnom and bb dye feed for 30 min without an external electrical potential subsequently 2 m nacl was filtered through the fully loaded membrane for desorption 2 3 3 electrosorption and desorption of bb dye and nom models in electrosorption and desorption experiments with bb dye and nom model compounds sorption time was increased from 2 5 to 5 to 10 to 20 minutes subsequently the adsorbed and desorbed mass was calculated moreover impact of electro osmotic flow was monitored by the constant measurement of the tmp 2 3 4 impact of ionic strength and ph adsorption of charged substances onto opposite charged surfaces is influenced by the ionic strength of the bulk solution weaver et al 2013 the zeta potential of the membrane itself as well as the charge of the dissolved substances are determined by the ionic strength due to the compression of electrical double layer edl luxbacher 2014 in order to assess the impact of ionic strength on the electrosorption capacity filtration experiments with 0 1 10 and 100 mmol l nacl were conducted with bb dye and srnom feed solutions at ph 7 the ph of the feed solution has a direct impact on the charge of the membrane as well as the charge of organic substances in the feed solution especially the resulting nom charge is highly depending on the ph zularisam et al 2006 for these reasons electrosorptive filtration experiments with srnom and bb dye were conducted at ph 4 ph 7 and ph 10 at a constant ionic strength of 1 mmol l nacl 2 3 5 impact of intrinsic membrane charge in order to evaluate the impact of the intrinsic charge of the membrane electrosorption and desorption experiments were carried out with the positively charged m5 as well as with the negatively charged pes up150 membrane under the same experimental conditions for this srnom feed was filtrated at ph 7 1 mmol l nacl and a constant flux of 100 l m² h positive and negative potentials were applied consecutively in order to induce sorption and desorption respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane characterisation ultra thin gold coating 40 nm thickness of the m5 membrane leads to a surface conductivity of 3 x 107 s m which lays in the range of pure gold the gold deposition decreased the pure water permeability of the membrane from 1300 to 1100 l m² h bar fig 3 a on the one hand the reduction of permeability can be attributed to a reduction of pore size virgin m5 50 nm due the coating process however on the other hand the gold coating also increased the hydrophobicity of the m5 membrane by elevating the contact angle from 22 to 33 fig 3b which could also contribute to the reduction of permeability the increase of hydrophobicity of the m5 membrane can be explained by the hydrophobic nature of sputtered gold films canning et al 2014 bet surface area of both membranes m5 and up150 were increased by gold coating with 1 0 and 1 5 m² g bet area respectively fig 3c compared to the up150 membrane the m5 membrane showed an 8 fold higher bet surface area which can be attributed to the more sponge like structure of the m5 membrane see fig 5 however bet surface area of technically used adsorbents like activated carbon is still two orders of magnitude higher than of the m5 membrane schulz et al 2017 when the feed pump was turned off and at the same time a potential was applied between the conductive active and conductive support layer of the m5 membrane an electroosmotic flux was measured as observed in our previous study mantel et al 2021 the electro osmotic flow increased linearly with the applied potential when the active layer of the membrane was charged positively when the active layer was charged negatively the direction of the electro osmotic flow was reversed fig 3d contribution of electroosmosis to the flux is approximately 10 l m² h v at positive cell potential and vice versa the intrinsic charge of the m5 membrane is positive fig 4 a and the intrinsic charge of the up150 is negative fig 4b in the range of ph 3 9 this observations are supported by the results of the ftir analysis which exhibit the typical positively charged primary secondary and tertiary amine groups fig 4c whereas the ftir spectrogram of the polyethersulfone up150 displays the negatively charged sulfonic group fig 4d the zeta potential of elementary gold is lower than the one of the positively charged m5 but higher than of the negatively charged up150 membrane huang et al 2014 apparently the gold coating shifts the zeta potential of both membranes towards the zeta potential of elementary gold this leads to a decrease of the zeta potential of the positively charged m5 by approximately 20 mv and an increase of the zeta potential of the negatively charged up150 membrane by approximately 10 mv sem images of the gold coated m5 membrane display a very porous sponge like surface fig 5 compared to up150 membrane mantel et al 2021 the m5 membrane structure offers more surface area for adsorption which is also revealed by the bet measurements fig 3c cyclic voltammetry showed that adsorption of oh ions and formation of gold oxides starts at 1 v vs ag agcl reference but no water splitting is observed until 1 4 v vs ag agcl fig 6 a diaz morales et al 2013 at a cell potential of around 2 8 v water splitting and oxygen evolution begin fig 6b which is in accordance with the literature coustan et al 2017 the findings are comparable to the results of our previous study where a duplex gold coated up150 was investigated mantel et al 2021 due to these results a maximum cell potential of 2 5 v was applied to prevent the formation of hydrogen or oxygen at the membrane surface and to keep the energy demand of the electrosorptive uf process low 3 2 electrosorptive filtration and desorption experiments 3 2 1 sorption capacity of uncharged vs externally charged m5 membrane when the pristine m5 membrane was used for filtration of bb dye and srnom at 0 v an intrinsic removal capacity was observed in the first 30 and 15 minutes of filtration respectively fig 7 a b breakthrough curves at no and positive potential show the typical s shape of adsorptive membranes ladd effio et al 2016 the intrinsic adsorption capacity for bb dye is 200 mg per m² flat sheet membrane or 4 mg per g of membrane when an external potential of 2 5 v is applied this value increases by 4 9 folds to 980 mg m² or 19 6 mg g intrinsic adsorption capacity for srnom is 90 mg toc per m² flat sheet membrane or 1 8 mg toc g membrane when a positive potential of 2 5 v is applied the adsorption capacity increases by 5 4 folds to 490 mg toc m² due to the intrinsic adsorption capacity also passive adsorption of negatively charged substances on the membrane without the application of positive potential is possible however a periodical desorption by the application of negative potential would still be necessary palko et al 2018 3 2 2 electrodesorption with external potential vs salt elution the mechanism for the intrinsic adsorption fig 7 is supposed to be electrostatic attraction of negatively charged molecules to the positively charged membrane structure desorption of the fully loaded m5 membrane was achieved by application of negative potential to the active layer and positive potential to the support layer see also fig 15 at this charge configuration an electrophoretic force acts on negatively charged substances in the membrane structure huotari et al 1999 which results in the desorption of srnom fig 8 a and bb dye fig 8c at desorption experiments with negative applied potential a secondary desorption peak was detected when the potential was changed from 2 5 v to 0 v this is explained by a secondary desorption of srnom and bb dye molecules from the previously positively charged support layer see also fig 15 likewise by increasing the ionic strength electrostatic forces are reduced therefore desorption of srnom fig 8b and bb dye fig 8d is observed when the membrane is rinsed with 2 m nacl the desorption curves show the typical tailing effect that was also observed with different adsorptive membranes ladd effio et al 2016 teepakorn et al 2015 at desorption with 2 m nacl no secondary desorption peak is visible which supports the above mentioned hypothesis the experiments showed that electrodesorbed mass was 7 and 8 lower for srnom and bb dye compared to the salt based desorption respectively likewise at electrosorptive removal of nom with cdi electrodes complete electrodesorption of nom from activated carbon electrodes is not possible l chen et al 2018 this is attributed to the fact that nom adsorption on activated carbon electrodes and probably also onto the m5 membrane is based on electrostatic and steric pore adsorption mechanisms at the same time q li et al 2003 however when the ionic strength is increased nom molecules coil and decrease their size as well as their charge zularisam et al 2006 and therefore can overcome the steric pore adsorption as well as the electrostatic adsorption mechanism whereas at potential driven desorption the steric pore adsorption mechanism is still acting 3 2 3 electrosorption and desorption of bb dye and nom models through the implementation of the online uv vis measurement in the permeate stream it was possible to balance the mass of adsorbed and desorbed dye at positive and negative applied potential fig 9 a an immediate adsorption of bb dye is observed when positive potential is applied and when the potential is reversed a desorption peak appears the desorption curve especially shows the typical tailing behaviour which is also observed when adsorptive membranes are desorbed by salt elution teepakorn et al 2015 however after the main first peak a second minor peak occurred immediately after potential was reversed analogous phenomena were observed by functionalized cdi electrodes and called inversion peak biesheuvel et al 2015 x gao et al 2014 this secondary minor peak is explained with desorption of dye from the membranes support layer that was positively charged during desorption phase fig 15b likewise at the beginning of desorption phase a small sorption peak is occurring indicating minor electrosorption on the support layer filtration experiments with bb dye fig 9 showed that electrosorption of the dye is a reversible process fritz et al 2020 by reversing the potential from anodic to cathodic charge the desorption of previously adsorbed dye is observed the longer the membrane is positively charged the more dye is adsorbed to its surface in a linear matter as the dye is almost completely removed from the feed solution this can also be seen in the linear increasing surface area and height of the desorption peaks the mass of desorbed bb dye almost equals 96 98 the mass of the previously adsorbed dye molecules fig 10 a due to this electro oxidation s chen et al 2020 is not considered to be a dominant mechanism for the removal of bb dye at anodic cell potential of 2 5 v electrosorption and desorption was observed at filtration of all three nom models at filtration with no applied potential almost no srnom fig 11 hsnom fig s5 and saha fig s6 were removed as soon as positive potential was applied uv254 removal rate was increasing immediately up to 70 for srnom and 75 for hsnom and 93 for saha subsequently application of negative potential led to desorption of previously electrosorbed nom the sorption time proportionally impacted the amount of electrosorbed and desorbed mass of nom fig 10b d however nom did not completely desorb at 2 5 v but only to 85 95 an explanation for the missing nom fraction is provided by lc ocd chromatograms of the permeate samples at different applied potentials fig s9 the data indicates that some of the missing nom molecules were oxidized at 2 5 v and cracked into smaller non aromatic nom molecules which cannot be detected with uv254 measurement weishaar et al 2003 at positive potential of 2 5 v electro osmositic contribution to the filtration flux is 20 l m² h or 0 04 bar of tmp and vice versa at negative potential the electroosmotic effect on the flux was visible for all nom models to the same extent membrane fouling was comparably low with a tmp increase through entire filtration time of 5 4 and 7 for srnom hsnom and saha filtration respectively at bb dye filtration fouling was not seen at all due to absence of colloids in the feed fig 9b likewise at long term filtration of hohloh lake water no severe membrane fouling was observed fig s7a moreover the doc removal performance remained constant through six sorption and desorption cycles and four hours of filtration fig s7b 3 2 4 nom removal performance of electrosorptive membrane the nom models used in this work were fractionized with commercially available uf and nf membranes with known mwco before benecke 2018 this fractionation data was used to evaluate the removal performance of the electrosorptive uf membrane when no potential is applied to m5 membrane the removal performance is less than 5 for all nom models fig 12 when positive potential is applied to the m5 membrane toc uv254 and uv436 reduction strongly increases to a removal performance in the range of nf membrane between 0 3 and 1 kda molecular weight cut off this removal enhancement was also observed by lc ocd measurements fig s8 evidently saha removal rate by electrosorption is higher r uv254 93 fig 12c than of srnom r uv254 70 fig 12a and hsnom r uv254 75 fig 12b this may be explained with higher negative charge density tab 1 and aromaticity of saha compared to srnom and hsnom table 1 moreover saha is mostly negatively charged at ph 7 whereas srnom and hsnom contain fractions that are not charged at neutral ph gray et al 2007 and therefore cannot be electrosorbed to the membrane 3 2 5 impact of ionic strengths and ph on electrosorption when no ions are present in the feed solution only minimal effect of external applied potential was observed for electrosorption of bb dye fig 13 a and srnom fig 13b as soon as 1 mmol l nacl was added to the feed solutions an immediate increase of electrosorption capacity was observed one explanation for this may be that electrosorption can only take place when the dissolved organic substances exhibit an electrical double layer which is not the case when no ions are present in the solution another reason could be the fact that at very low conductivities of the feed almost no current can flow between the electrodes due to a high electrical resistance increasing ionic strength has a substantial impact on the sorption capacity of nom but only minor impact on bb dye xing et al 2012 electrosorption fig 13a b at an ionic strength of more than 10 mmol l sorption capacity of nom decreases significantly benavidez garcia 2013 this is because the charge of nom is more sensitive to the presence of ions than the charge of bb dye due to its molecule structure nom coils and loses charge density with increasing ionic strength zularisam et al 2006 in addition to ionic strength the ph affects the electrosorption capacity of srnom fig 13c d but not of bb dye at alkaline ph nom is charged more negatively and at acidic ph nom is charged more neutral due to the relatively high pka values of carboxylic pka between 3 8 4 8 gjessing 1976 and hydroxyl functional groups pka between 8 10 benecke 2018 conversely bb dye is charged negatively at all investigated ph values due to the low pka of sulfonic functional group pka 1 pirillo et al 2009 in contrast to this ph also has an impact on the intrinsic membrane charge fig 4a with lower ph lead to more positive and higher ph to more negative zeta potential possibly the superposition of the phenomena described above can explain the lowest and highest srnom electrosorption at ph 10 and ph 7 respectively 3 2 6 impact of the intrinsic membrane charge unlike the m5 membrane the up150 did not show any intrinsic sorption capacity for srnom or bb dye which is attributed to the negatively intrinsic surface potential of the up150 see fig 4a vs fig 4b membrane when the gold coated up150 is used for an electrosorptive filtration experiment fig 14 b it exhibits a completely different nom removal behaviour than m5 membrane fig 14a uv254 peaks are not as distinct as for the m5 membrane and also show a trend in the opposite direction when a positive potential is applied permeate concentration increases and when a negative potential is applied a short time rejection enhancement can be observed apparently the nom rejection of the up150 is only enhanced at repulsive negative potential however at dead end filtration mode the phenomena of concentration polarization leads to timely limited removal of nom keller et al 2017 this hypothesis is supported by the fact that when potential is changed to positive polarity breakthrough of concentration polarization can be observed but only minor electrosorption of nom unlike the m5 membrane the up150 membrane does not seem to be applicable for the electrosorptive removal of negatively charged substances due to its intrinsic negative zeta potential 3 3 discussion gold coating of the m5 membranes led to an electrically conductive uf membrane which is capable to electroadsorb and electrodesorb charged organic substances two different adsorption mechanisms during filtration are proposed on the one hand intrinsic sorption fig 7 takes place onto the polymer pore structure fig 15 a and on the other hand electrosorption occurs on the positively polarized gold layer fig 15c when it is charged externally paik et al 2003 this allows operation at passive adsorption fritz et al 2019 followed by electrodesorption fig 15b and operation at potential driven adsorption 2 5 v followed by electrodesorption fig 15d desorption of adsorbed bb dye and nom is possible through the application of negative potential fig 8 10 chon paik 2001 however uv vis mass balance fig 10 did only show a desorption rate of 85 95 for the nom model compounds whereas the dye was desorbed almost completely with a desorption rate of 96 98 fig 10 this observation can be explained with lc ocd chromatograms of srnom permeate samples 2 5 v 2 5 v and 0 v which indicate that the missing nom fraction was electrochemically cracked into smaller nom molecules at 2 5 v fig s9c in general the smaller nom molecules are not as aromatic as the original bigger humic nom molecules and therefore show a lower uv254 signal since uv254 represents mainly the aromatic nom molecules weishaar et al 2003 consequently the detected electrodesorbed mass appeared to be lower than the electrosorbed and partly cracked mass the mechanism for electrodesorption is not completely revealed on the one hand desorption could be induced by the change of surface potential from positive to negative charge and the electric field mantel et al 2021 which leads to a repulsive electrostatic fes and a electrophoretic force fep on the charged substances respectively fig 15b on the other hand other studies recently revealed that at negative charged membrane electrodes formation of oh ions lead to a local ph increase jung et al 2020 monteiro and koper 2021 this could also cause desorption due to an ion exchange process weaver et al 2013 and because of a reduction of the surface charge of the membrane fig 4a ionic strength has a crucial impact on the sorption capacity of nom but only minor impact on bb dye electrosorption fig 15a b therefore electrosorptive uf process will show less performance at higher salinities however surface and ground water treatment is not affected by this limitation due to moderate ionic strengths osadchyy et al 2016 electrosorptive adsorption was observed for the gold coated m5 membrane but not with gold coated pes up150 membrane fig 14 this is attributed to the negative zeta potential of the pes polymer which hinders significant electrosorptive accumulation onto the membrane even when a positive potential is externally applied fritz et al 2020 apparently ecm with positive or neutral zeta potential should be used for electrosorptive application whereas ecm with negative zeta potential are more suitable for electrorepulsive filtration fritz et al 2019 further experiments could investigate this hypothesis by using a novel set up to measure in situ zeta potential when the ecm is charged with an external potential saha et al 2019 electrical current measured during filtration experiments had an average value of less than 5 ma for a membrane surface area of 42 cm² this leads to a current density of lower 1 1 a m2 the low current density as well as the cyclic voltammetry experiments fig 6 support the hypothesis that the impact of faradic reactions such as electrochemical oxidation is not a dominant factor at electrosorptive uf q zhang vecitis 2014 however lc ocd chromatograms indicate that a minor amount of nom molecules did degenerate into smaller organic fragments possible due to very energy efficient electrocatalytic oxidation lamy 1984 in general electrochemical oxidation could be beneficial for fouling mitigation in further investigation even higher positive potentials could be applied for short time intervals in order to clean the membrane from organic foulants by oxidation karkooti et al 2020 nevertheless anodic oxidation could also cause a long term destruction of the m5 membrane since polyamide is not resistant against oxidation the additional energy consumption at a cell voltage of 2 5 v and current density of 1 1 a m² results in 2 9 w m² of membrane surface at a flux of 100 l m² h the extra needed energy would be 0 03 kwh m ³ which is low compared to the specific energy needed for uf process of 0 3 0 5 kwh m ³ guo et al 2009 duplex gold coating was used to investigate electrosorptive uf process since it is a relatively simple method to generate a conductive membrane however it leads to additional material costs of about 20 per m² of membrane this would approximately double the cost the of a uf membrane module nevertheless it is possible to use cheaper metals such as silver 0 5 m² or conductive carbon based materials in order to generate a less expensive duplex coated membrane though when calculating the total specific costs per m³ of nf permeate the investment cost for the membrane modules play a subordinate role compared to the energy costs costa and pinho 2006 therefore even the application of a gold coated electrosorptive uf membrane could be economically beneficial due to the higher energy efficiency altogether application of electrosorptive uf process leads a membrane with high permeability between mf and uf with a high nom removal rate in the range of nf and is therefore breaking the selectivity permeability trade off fig 16 however the electrosorptive membrane needs to be regenerated periodically by reversing the potential at regeneration mode a concentrated desorbate is generated which needs to be disposed until now the ratio of electrosorptive filtration phase and desorption phase is 3 to 1 fig s7 which leads to a water recovery of 75 the water recovery could be increased by using a second filtration stage or optimization of the desorption phase e g faster desorption at higher negative desorption potential compared to conventional cathodic charging electrorepulsion of ecm the electrosorptive uf process proved to be more effective in enhancing the nom removal performance fig 16 moreover electrorepulsive filtration at negative surface potential needs to be operated in cross flow mode in order to avoid concentration polarization in contrast to this electrosorptive uf process shows full removal performance by simple and energy efficient dead end filtration 4 conclusions the key findings of this study are application of positive potentials leads to a substantial increase in permeability due to electro osmotic effect fouling was not found to be problematic the intrinsic charge of the membrane material determines the electrosorption capacity ecm with intrinsic positive m5 or negative up150 zeta potential may be applied for electrosorptive or electro repulsive filtration respectively electrosorption is largely reversible and can be used to either remove or concentrate charged dissolved organic substances electrosorption is highly dependent on ionic strengths in the absence of ions and electrical double layer no electrosorption and desorption can be observed at very high ionic strengths electrosorption is likewise limited due to the decreased charge of substances and sorption competition electrosorption of nom is dependent on ph because the charge of nom and the membranes material changes with varying ph electrosorptive uf may facilitates the use of positively charged mf uf membranes for separation tasks of nf membranes e g removal of refractory organic pollutants such as phenolic compounds pharmaceuticals dyes and pesticides overall we provided the proof of concept for energy efficient removal of charged organic molecules with a novel electrosorptive uf process

16854,negatively charged electrically conductive ultrafiltration uf membranes have been intensively investigated for fouling mitigation and rejection enhancement in recent years this study reports the novel approach of applying positive charge 2 5 v cell potential to a conductive membrane to induce electrosorption of negatively charged substances onto the membrane subsequently desorption of negatively charged substances is achieved by changing the potential periodically e g after 30 min to negative charge 2 5 v cell potential for this purpose sputter deposition of ultra thin gold layers 40 nm is used to generate electrically conductive gold polymer gold flat sheet membranes by coating the active and the support layer of two commercial polymer uf membranes polyethersulfone up150 polyamide m5 when m5 membrane was charged positively during filtration 2 5 v suwannee river nom hohloh lake nom humic acid and brilliant blue ionic dye showed removal rates of 70 75 and 93 and 99 respectively whereas when no potential was applied 0 v removal rates were only 1 5 when a positive potential was applied to the active membrane layer and a negative potential was applied to the support layer cell potential 2 5 v a significant increase of flux with 25 l m² h was observed due to the induction of electro osmosis electrosorption was only observed for m5 membrane ζ 13 mv ph 7 and not with up150 membrane ζ 29 mv ph 7 due to a low current density of 1 1 a m² at a flux of 100 l m² h the additional energy consumption of electrosorption and desorption process was low with 0 03 kwh per m³ of permeate this study delivered the proof of concept for the novel process of electrosorptive uf with energy consumption between microfiltration and ultrafiltration but nom removal rates of nanofiltration membranes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords electrically conductive membrane electrosorption nom 1 introduction ultrafiltration uf is a promising technology for both the production of drinking water as well as the treatment of wastewater but suffers from the selectivity permeability trade off park et al 2017 with increasing selectivity the permeability decreases resulting in a higher specific energy demand in general conventional dead end uf is not capable to meet the growing demand of removing dissolved organic water constituents such as natural organic matter nom or organic micropollutants from feed water acero et al 2016 j winter et al 2017 for such separation tasks less energy efficient nanofiltration nf is applied s lee and lee 2007 a new approach to enhance the selectivity of uf membranes is the application of electrically conductive membranes ecms formoso et al 2017 research on ecms has undergone a strong increase in the recent years due the development of novel conductive membrane materials straub et al 2021 and promising results regarding the fouling and rejection behaviour of externally charged uf membranes when a cathodic potential is applied to the membrane surface dudchenko et al 2014 a repulsive electrostatic force is induced fig 1 a due to the negative membrane charge and the likewise negative charge of most dissolved organic compounds shao et al 2011 several studies showed this behaviour by using different types of ecms x zhu jassby 2019 the present study aims at breaking the permeability selectivity trade off by combining the processes of uf and electrosorption through application of a low positive anodic potential to the uf membrane negatively charged organic molecules are electrostatically attracted to the membrane surface and bond via electrosorption fig 1b in order to maintain a sustainable filtration process the electro adsorbed substances will be desorbed periodically by reversing the applied potential to negative bias for this purpose an intrinsically positively charged polyamide pa uf membrane is employed due to its ability to adsorb negatively charged substances even without an applied positive potential the pa membrane was made electrically conductive by gold duplex coating active and support layer with this method no additional counter electrode is necessary to apply an external potential mantel et al 2021 for future technical application gold could be substituted with cheaper conductive materials such as laser induced graphene or conductive nanoparticles sun et al 2021 in literature electrosorption of ions choi et al 2019 as well as charged dissolved organic molecules x su and hatton 2017 onto carbon electrodes is a well known and intensively investigated process in fact the technology of capacitive deionization cdi is based on similar mechanisms of electrosorption and desorption as proposed in the present study however cdi is mainly used for desalination porada et al 2013 and the presence of organic macromolecules may lead to fouling of the flow by carbon electrodes r chen et al 2020 in contrast to this electrosorptive uf is not targeting the removal of salts but of charged organic molecules for this the ecm serves as a flow through electrode and conventional uf membrane at the same time which provides a beneficial mass transfer vecitis et al 2011 several studies have already shown that electrosorption of organic macromolecules such as proteins htwe et al 2018 and inorganic colloids such as silica particles morrow et al 2007 occurs on plane conductive materials such as metals however the complete desorption of previously electrosorbed substances by reversal of the external potential is reported to be difficult tramis et al 2019 lately an electrically conductive carbon microfiltration mf membrane was developed that showed comparably high removal rates for nom compounds at positive potentials s chen et al 2020 however this study did not report data on electrodesorption and regeneration of the membrane to our best knowledge no other publication reports on such investigations the intention of the present study is presenting the proof of concept for the electrosorptive removal of dissolved organic water constituents with an electrically conductive uf membrane in order to gain a better understanding of this process different key parameters such as the impact of ionic strength ph intrinsic membrane charge and applied potential was studied furthermore different nom models as well as ionic dyes were employed as organic model substances in the feed solution eventually real surface water was tested including several electrosorption and electrodesorption cycles 2 material and methods 2 1 membrane preparation and characterization a hydrophilic and positively charged pa flat sheet membrane m5 with permeability between mf and uf was kindly supplied by i3 membrane gmbh germany the porous membrane was duplex coated with 40 nm of gold on the active and the support side fig 1 with a laboratory sputter coater scd 005 baltec lichtenstein mantel et al 2018 in this way no additional counter electrode was needed to apply an external potential to the membrane mantel et al 2021 active membrane area was 42 cm² and the membrane thickness equivalent to electrode distance was 0 14 mm the virgin and gold coated m5 membranes were characterized regarding pure water permeability zeta potential contact angle electrical surface conductivity brunauer emmett teller bet surface area scanning electron microscopy sem and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir bet surface area was measured with tristar asap 201 micromeritics instrument usa 0 2 g of the virgin and gold coated m5 was analyzed at a temperature of 77 k with nitrogen as analysis adsorptive ftir spectroscopy was conducted with alpha p from burker usa cyclic voltammetry was conducted with duplex coated m5 membrane and ag agcl reference electrode xylem analytics germany the working and counter electrode were the gold coated active and support layer of the same flat sheet membrane respectively the detailed procedure is explained in our previous study mantel et al 2021 electro osmosis was investigated at ph 7 and 1 mmol l 1 nacl in pure water for this the membrane was placed in the filtration cell and charged with anodic and cathodic cell potentials of 0 1 0 2 5 and 5 0 v fig s5 the feed pump was not operated in these experiments so that the fluid flow was only induced by the applied electrical field consequently electro osmotic flow was measured as the positive or negative permeate flow and pressure was determined by measuring the transmembrane pressure tmp mantel et al 2021 more information on up150 membrane and the characterization methods regarding pure water permeability zeta potential contact angle electrical surface conductivity and scanning electron microscopy sem can be found in our recent studies mantel et al 2018 mantel et al 2021 2 2 feed solutions 2 2 1 nom models and hohloh lake water three nom model solutions with different charge densities and aromaticity were chosen to investigate electrosorptive binding capacity of the m5 membrane tab 1 due to the deprotonated carboxylic and hydroxyl groups nom are charged negatively at neutral ph fig s1 gray et al 2007 charge density is given as total acidity which is defined as the sum of phenolic hydroxyl and carboxylic acidity benecke 2018 the aromaticity is measured with the suva which is defined as uv absorbance of a sample at 254 nm divided by the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration weishaar et al 2003 as a humic acid model sigma aldrich humic acids saha sigma aldrich usa was chosen to represent a mainly negative charged and highly aromatic nom substances in order to remove impurities such as fulvic acids saha was purified before use following a procedure explained in the reference tang et al 2007 suwanee river nom srnom model was chosen to represent the whole range of charged and uncharged nom spectra matilainen et al 2011 srnom was obtained from international humic substances society 2r101n ihss usa natural surface water with high nom content came from the hohloh lake hsnom the hohloh lake is in the boggy black forest baden württemberg germany and contains 23 5 mg l 1 of toc more detailed data of hohloh lake can be found in reference benecke 2018 prior to experiments hohloh lake water was diluted with pure water in a ratio of one to three to ensure equal doc concentrations for all nom model water ionic strengths and ph were adjusted by adding 1 mmol l nacl and by dosing naoh or hcl respectively all feed solutions were pre filtered with a 0 2 µm membrane in order to avoid particle fouling measurement of feed and permeate concentration was conducted via total organic carbon toc detection applying toc analyzer shimadzu toc l cph japan photometric evaluation of nom was determined at a wavelength of 254 nm for the detection of conjugated double bonds of the nom leenheer and croué 2003 as well as at 436 nm for the detection of typical yellow color of nom containing water schulz et al 2017 with a spectrophotometer dr5000 hach germany doc was obtained by toc measurement after removal of particles by filtration millipore membrane 0 45 µm in order to evaluate the size distribution of the removed nom liquid chromatography analysis lc ocd were conducted huber et al 2011 doc labor huber germany 2 2 2 ionic dye solutions as a representative of a negatively charged ionic dye molecule brilliant blue bb mw 793 g mol dye was chosen with a concentration of 3 5 mg l fig s2 the blue dye was photometrically measured at a wavelength of 629 nm the ionic strength of the dye feed was increased by dosing 1 mmol l nacl and ph was set to ph 7 by titration of 0 1 m naoh bb dye was obtained from sigma aldrich usa 2 3 experimental set up of filtration dead end filtration was carried out in a modified commercial filtration cell sterlitech cf042 usa fig 2 pressure was applied with a gear pump mcp z ismatech germany and regulated manually during the experiment to maintain a constant flux the pressure was measured before and after the filtration cell to calculate the tmp the filtration flux was determined with a digital balance pcb kern germany which was connected to a computer filtration experiments were conducted with direct current cell potentials of 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 v with anodic positive and cathodic negative membrane charge electrical potential was held constant and the current was measured with a potentiostat pgu ips elektroniklabor germany electrical connection into the membrane cell was accomplished through titanium foils fig s3 all filtration experiments were performed in triplicates to investigate the immediate impact of voltage application a flow through cuvette hellma 10 mm germany was placed beyond the membrane filtration cell in the permeate stream fig 2 extinction of uv vis at a certain wavelength 254 nm for nom 629 nm for bb dye was measured every four seconds to determine the adsorbed and desorbed mass flux was kept constant at 100 and 240 l m² h for nom and dye experiments respectively for calculation of adsorbed and desorbed nom and dye mass the uv vis peak areas were integrated following equation 1 where mads is the adsorbed mass v is volume of filtered water c0 is the initial concentration of the feed and c is the actual concentration measured during the experiment negative values of mads stand for adsorbed mass and positive values stand for desorbed mass 1 m a d s 0 v c 0 c d v 2 3 1 sorption capacity of uncharged vs externally charged m5 membrane to evaluate the intrinsic adsorption capacity of the positively charged m5 membrane filtration experiments with the pristine and fresh m5 membrane were conducted for this srnom and bb dye were used as feed solutions moreover the same experiment was carried out with the application of 2 5 v to compare to the breakthrough curves of srnom and bb dye of the uncharged and externally charged membranes at all following filtration experiments intrinsic adsorption capacity of the m5 membrane was fully saturated before the actual electrosorptive filtration experiment started in order to avoid interference 2 3 2 electrodesorption with external potential vs salt elution adsorbed charged substances can be desorbed from charged membranes by rinsing the membrane with high concentrations of salt solutions teepakorn et al 2015 at high nacl concentrations electrostatic forces are decreased and also ion exchange can take place yang et al 2002 membrane loading was achieved by dead end filtration of the srnom and bb dye feed for 30 min without an external electrical potential subsequently 2 m nacl was filtered through the fully loaded membrane for desorption 2 3 3 electrosorption and desorption of bb dye and nom models in electrosorption and desorption experiments with bb dye and nom model compounds sorption time was increased from 2 5 to 5 to 10 to 20 minutes subsequently the adsorbed and desorbed mass was calculated moreover impact of electro osmotic flow was monitored by the constant measurement of the tmp 2 3 4 impact of ionic strength and ph adsorption of charged substances onto opposite charged surfaces is influenced by the ionic strength of the bulk solution weaver et al 2013 the zeta potential of the membrane itself as well as the charge of the dissolved substances are determined by the ionic strength due to the compression of electrical double layer edl luxbacher 2014 in order to assess the impact of ionic strength on the electrosorption capacity filtration experiments with 0 1 10 and 100 mmol l nacl were conducted with bb dye and srnom feed solutions at ph 7 the ph of the feed solution has a direct impact on the charge of the membrane as well as the charge of organic substances in the feed solution especially the resulting nom charge is highly depending on the ph zularisam et al 2006 for these reasons electrosorptive filtration experiments with srnom and bb dye were conducted at ph 4 ph 7 and ph 10 at a constant ionic strength of 1 mmol l nacl 2 3 5 impact of intrinsic membrane charge in order to evaluate the impact of the intrinsic charge of the membrane electrosorption and desorption experiments were carried out with the positively charged m5 as well as with the negatively charged pes up150 membrane under the same experimental conditions for this srnom feed was filtrated at ph 7 1 mmol l nacl and a constant flux of 100 l m² h positive and negative potentials were applied consecutively in order to induce sorption and desorption respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane characterisation ultra thin gold coating 40 nm thickness of the m5 membrane leads to a surface conductivity of 3 x 107 s m which lays in the range of pure gold the gold deposition decreased the pure water permeability of the membrane from 1300 to 1100 l m² h bar fig 3 a on the one hand the reduction of permeability can be attributed to a reduction of pore size virgin m5 50 nm due the coating process however on the other hand the gold coating also increased the hydrophobicity of the m5 membrane by elevating the contact angle from 22 to 33 fig 3b which could also contribute to the reduction of permeability the increase of hydrophobicity of the m5 membrane can be explained by the hydrophobic nature of sputtered gold films canning et al 2014 bet surface area of both membranes m5 and up150 were increased by gold coating with 1 0 and 1 5 m² g bet area respectively fig 3c compared to the up150 membrane the m5 membrane showed an 8 fold higher bet surface area which can be attributed to the more sponge like structure of the m5 membrane see fig 5 however bet surface area of technically used adsorbents like activated carbon is still two orders of magnitude higher than of the m5 membrane schulz et al 2017 when the feed pump was turned off and at the same time a potential was applied between the conductive active and conductive support layer of the m5 membrane an electroosmotic flux was measured as observed in our previous study mantel et al 2021 the electro osmotic flow increased linearly with the applied potential when the active layer of the membrane was charged positively when the active layer was charged negatively the direction of the electro osmotic flow was reversed fig 3d contribution of electroosmosis to the flux is approximately 10 l m² h v at positive cell potential and vice versa the intrinsic charge of the m5 membrane is positive fig 4 a and the intrinsic charge of the up150 is negative fig 4b in the range of ph 3 9 this observations are supported by the results of the ftir analysis which exhibit the typical positively charged primary secondary and tertiary amine groups fig 4c whereas the ftir spectrogram of the polyethersulfone up150 displays the negatively charged sulfonic group fig 4d the zeta potential of elementary gold is lower than the one of the positively charged m5 but higher than of the negatively charged up150 membrane huang et al 2014 apparently the gold coating shifts the zeta potential of both membranes towards the zeta potential of elementary gold this leads to a decrease of the zeta potential of the positively charged m5 by approximately 20 mv and an increase of the zeta potential of the negatively charged up150 membrane by approximately 10 mv sem images of the gold coated m5 membrane display a very porous sponge like surface fig 5 compared to up150 membrane mantel et al 2021 the m5 membrane structure offers more surface area for adsorption which is also revealed by the bet measurements fig 3c cyclic voltammetry showed that adsorption of oh ions and formation of gold oxides starts at 1 v vs ag agcl reference but no water splitting is observed until 1 4 v vs ag agcl fig 6 a diaz morales et al 2013 at a cell potential of around 2 8 v water splitting and oxygen evolution begin fig 6b which is in accordance with the literature coustan et al 2017 the findings are comparable to the results of our previous study where a duplex gold coated up150 was investigated mantel et al 2021 due to these results a maximum cell potential of 2 5 v was applied to prevent the formation of hydrogen or oxygen at the membrane surface and to keep the energy demand of the electrosorptive uf process low 3 2 electrosorptive filtration and desorption experiments 3 2 1 sorption capacity of uncharged vs externally charged m5 membrane when the pristine m5 membrane was used for filtration of bb dye and srnom at 0 v an intrinsic removal capacity was observed in the first 30 and 15 minutes of filtration respectively fig 7 a b breakthrough curves at no and positive potential show the typical s shape of adsorptive membranes ladd effio et al 2016 the intrinsic adsorption capacity for bb dye is 200 mg per m² flat sheet membrane or 4 mg per g of membrane when an external potential of 2 5 v is applied this value increases by 4 9 folds to 980 mg m² or 19 6 mg g intrinsic adsorption capacity for srnom is 90 mg toc per m² flat sheet membrane or 1 8 mg toc g membrane when a positive potential of 2 5 v is applied the adsorption capacity increases by 5 4 folds to 490 mg toc m² due to the intrinsic adsorption capacity also passive adsorption of negatively charged substances on the membrane without the application of positive potential is possible however a periodical desorption by the application of negative potential would still be necessary palko et al 2018 3 2 2 electrodesorption with external potential vs salt elution the mechanism for the intrinsic adsorption fig 7 is supposed to be electrostatic attraction of negatively charged molecules to the positively charged membrane structure desorption of the fully loaded m5 membrane was achieved by application of negative potential to the active layer and positive potential to the support layer see also fig 15 at this charge configuration an electrophoretic force acts on negatively charged substances in the membrane structure huotari et al 1999 which results in the desorption of srnom fig 8 a and bb dye fig 8c at desorption experiments with negative applied potential a secondary desorption peak was detected when the potential was changed from 2 5 v to 0 v this is explained by a secondary desorption of srnom and bb dye molecules from the previously positively charged support layer see also fig 15 likewise by increasing the ionic strength electrostatic forces are reduced therefore desorption of srnom fig 8b and bb dye fig 8d is observed when the membrane is rinsed with 2 m nacl the desorption curves show the typical tailing effect that was also observed with different adsorptive membranes ladd effio et al 2016 teepakorn et al 2015 at desorption with 2 m nacl no secondary desorption peak is visible which supports the above mentioned hypothesis the experiments showed that electrodesorbed mass was 7 and 8 lower for srnom and bb dye compared to the salt based desorption respectively likewise at electrosorptive removal of nom with cdi electrodes complete electrodesorption of nom from activated carbon electrodes is not possible l chen et al 2018 this is attributed to the fact that nom adsorption on activated carbon electrodes and probably also onto the m5 membrane is based on electrostatic and steric pore adsorption mechanisms at the same time q li et al 2003 however when the ionic strength is increased nom molecules coil and decrease their size as well as their charge zularisam et al 2006 and therefore can overcome the steric pore adsorption as well as the electrostatic adsorption mechanism whereas at potential driven desorption the steric pore adsorption mechanism is still acting 3 2 3 electrosorption and desorption of bb dye and nom models through the implementation of the online uv vis measurement in the permeate stream it was possible to balance the mass of adsorbed and desorbed dye at positive and negative applied potential fig 9 a an immediate adsorption of bb dye is observed when positive potential is applied and when the potential is reversed a desorption peak appears the desorption curve especially shows the typical tailing behaviour which is also observed when adsorptive membranes are desorbed by salt elution teepakorn et al 2015 however after the main first peak a second minor peak occurred immediately after potential was reversed analogous phenomena were observed by functionalized cdi electrodes and called inversion peak biesheuvel et al 2015 x gao et al 2014 this secondary minor peak is explained with desorption of dye from the membranes support layer that was positively charged during desorption phase fig 15b likewise at the beginning of desorption phase a small sorption peak is occurring indicating minor electrosorption on the support layer filtration experiments with bb dye fig 9 showed that electrosorption of the dye is a reversible process fritz et al 2020 by reversing the potential from anodic to cathodic charge the desorption of previously adsorbed dye is observed the longer the membrane is positively charged the more dye is adsorbed to its surface in a linear matter as the dye is almost completely removed from the feed solution this can also be seen in the linear increasing surface area and height of the desorption peaks the mass of desorbed bb dye almost equals 96 98 the mass of the previously adsorbed dye molecules fig 10 a due to this electro oxidation s chen et al 2020 is not considered to be a dominant mechanism for the removal of bb dye at anodic cell potential of 2 5 v electrosorption and desorption was observed at filtration of all three nom models at filtration with no applied potential almost no srnom fig 11 hsnom fig s5 and saha fig s6 were removed as soon as positive potential was applied uv254 removal rate was increasing immediately up to 70 for srnom and 75 for hsnom and 93 for saha subsequently application of negative potential led to desorption of previously electrosorbed nom the sorption time proportionally impacted the amount of electrosorbed and desorbed mass of nom fig 10b d however nom did not completely desorb at 2 5 v but only to 85 95 an explanation for the missing nom fraction is provided by lc ocd chromatograms of the permeate samples at different applied potentials fig s9 the data indicates that some of the missing nom molecules were oxidized at 2 5 v and cracked into smaller non aromatic nom molecules which cannot be detected with uv254 measurement weishaar et al 2003 at positive potential of 2 5 v electro osmositic contribution to the filtration flux is 20 l m² h or 0 04 bar of tmp and vice versa at negative potential the electroosmotic effect on the flux was visible for all nom models to the same extent membrane fouling was comparably low with a tmp increase through entire filtration time of 5 4 and 7 for srnom hsnom and saha filtration respectively at bb dye filtration fouling was not seen at all due to absence of colloids in the feed fig 9b likewise at long term filtration of hohloh lake water no severe membrane fouling was observed fig s7a moreover the doc removal performance remained constant through six sorption and desorption cycles and four hours of filtration fig s7b 3 2 4 nom removal performance of electrosorptive membrane the nom models used in this work were fractionized with commercially available uf and nf membranes with known mwco before benecke 2018 this fractionation data was used to evaluate the removal performance of the electrosorptive uf membrane when no potential is applied to m5 membrane the removal performance is less than 5 for all nom models fig 12 when positive potential is applied to the m5 membrane toc uv254 and uv436 reduction strongly increases to a removal performance in the range of nf membrane between 0 3 and 1 kda molecular weight cut off this removal enhancement was also observed by lc ocd measurements fig s8 evidently saha removal rate by electrosorption is higher r uv254 93 fig 12c than of srnom r uv254 70 fig 12a and hsnom r uv254 75 fig 12b this may be explained with higher negative charge density tab 1 and aromaticity of saha compared to srnom and hsnom table 1 moreover saha is mostly negatively charged at ph 7 whereas srnom and hsnom contain fractions that are not charged at neutral ph gray et al 2007 and therefore cannot be electrosorbed to the membrane 3 2 5 impact of ionic strengths and ph on electrosorption when no ions are present in the feed solution only minimal effect of external applied potential was observed for electrosorption of bb dye fig 13 a and srnom fig 13b as soon as 1 mmol l nacl was added to the feed solutions an immediate increase of electrosorption capacity was observed one explanation for this may be that electrosorption can only take place when the dissolved organic substances exhibit an electrical double layer which is not the case when no ions are present in the solution another reason could be the fact that at very low conductivities of the feed almost no current can flow between the electrodes due to a high electrical resistance increasing ionic strength has a substantial impact on the sorption capacity of nom but only minor impact on bb dye xing et al 2012 electrosorption fig 13a b at an ionic strength of more than 10 mmol l sorption capacity of nom decreases significantly benavidez garcia 2013 this is because the charge of nom is more sensitive to the presence of ions than the charge of bb dye due to its molecule structure nom coils and loses charge density with increasing ionic strength zularisam et al 2006 in addition to ionic strength the ph affects the electrosorption capacity of srnom fig 13c d but not of bb dye at alkaline ph nom is charged more negatively and at acidic ph nom is charged more neutral due to the relatively high pka values of carboxylic pka between 3 8 4 8 gjessing 1976 and hydroxyl functional groups pka between 8 10 benecke 2018 conversely bb dye is charged negatively at all investigated ph values due to the low pka of sulfonic functional group pka 1 pirillo et al 2009 in contrast to this ph also has an impact on the intrinsic membrane charge fig 4a with lower ph lead to more positive and higher ph to more negative zeta potential possibly the superposition of the phenomena described above can explain the lowest and highest srnom electrosorption at ph 10 and ph 7 respectively 3 2 6 impact of the intrinsic membrane charge unlike the m5 membrane the up150 did not show any intrinsic sorption capacity for srnom or bb dye which is attributed to the negatively intrinsic surface potential of the up150 see fig 4a vs fig 4b membrane when the gold coated up150 is used for an electrosorptive filtration experiment fig 14 b it exhibits a completely different nom removal behaviour than m5 membrane fig 14a uv254 peaks are not as distinct as for the m5 membrane and also show a trend in the opposite direction when a positive potential is applied permeate concentration increases and when a negative potential is applied a short time rejection enhancement can be observed apparently the nom rejection of the up150 is only enhanced at repulsive negative potential however at dead end filtration mode the phenomena of concentration polarization leads to timely limited removal of nom keller et al 2017 this hypothesis is supported by the fact that when potential is changed to positive polarity breakthrough of concentration polarization can be observed but only minor electrosorption of nom unlike the m5 membrane the up150 membrane does not seem to be applicable for the electrosorptive removal of negatively charged substances due to its intrinsic negative zeta potential 3 3 discussion gold coating of the m5 membranes led to an electrically conductive uf membrane which is capable to electroadsorb and electrodesorb charged organic substances two different adsorption mechanisms during filtration are proposed on the one hand intrinsic sorption fig 7 takes place onto the polymer pore structure fig 15 a and on the other hand electrosorption occurs on the positively polarized gold layer fig 15c when it is charged externally paik et al 2003 this allows operation at passive adsorption fritz et al 2019 followed by electrodesorption fig 15b and operation at potential driven adsorption 2 5 v followed by electrodesorption fig 15d desorption of adsorbed bb dye and nom is possible through the application of negative potential fig 8 10 chon paik 2001 however uv vis mass balance fig 10 did only show a desorption rate of 85 95 for the nom model compounds whereas the dye was desorbed almost completely with a desorption rate of 96 98 fig 10 this observation can be explained with lc ocd chromatograms of srnom permeate samples 2 5 v 2 5 v and 0 v which indicate that the missing nom fraction was electrochemically cracked into smaller nom molecules at 2 5 v fig s9c in general the smaller nom molecules are not as aromatic as the original bigger humic nom molecules and therefore show a lower uv254 signal since uv254 represents mainly the aromatic nom molecules weishaar et al 2003 consequently the detected electrodesorbed mass appeared to be lower than the electrosorbed and partly cracked mass the mechanism for electrodesorption is not completely revealed on the one hand desorption could be induced by the change of surface potential from positive to negative charge and the electric field mantel et al 2021 which leads to a repulsive electrostatic fes and a electrophoretic force fep on the charged substances respectively fig 15b on the other hand other studies recently revealed that at negative charged membrane electrodes formation of oh ions lead to a local ph increase jung et al 2020 monteiro and koper 2021 this could also cause desorption due to an ion exchange process weaver et al 2013 and because of a reduction of the surface charge of the membrane fig 4a ionic strength has a crucial impact on the sorption capacity of nom but only minor impact on bb dye electrosorption fig 15a b therefore electrosorptive uf process will show less performance at higher salinities however surface and ground water treatment is not affected by this limitation due to moderate ionic strengths osadchyy et al 2016 electrosorptive adsorption was observed for the gold coated m5 membrane but not with gold coated pes up150 membrane fig 14 this is attributed to the negative zeta potential of the pes polymer which hinders significant electrosorptive accumulation onto the membrane even when a positive potential is externally applied fritz et al 2020 apparently ecm with positive or neutral zeta potential should be used for electrosorptive application whereas ecm with negative zeta potential are more suitable for electrorepulsive filtration fritz et al 2019 further experiments could investigate this hypothesis by using a novel set up to measure in situ zeta potential when the ecm is charged with an external potential saha et al 2019 electrical current measured during filtration experiments had an average value of less than 5 ma for a membrane surface area of 42 cm² this leads to a current density of lower 1 1 a m2 the low current density as well as the cyclic voltammetry experiments fig 6 support the hypothesis that the impact of faradic reactions such as electrochemical oxidation is not a dominant factor at electrosorptive uf q zhang vecitis 2014 however lc ocd chromatograms indicate that a minor amount of nom molecules did degenerate into smaller organic fragments possible due to very energy efficient electrocatalytic oxidation lamy 1984 in general electrochemical oxidation could be beneficial for fouling mitigation in further investigation even higher positive potentials could be applied for short time intervals in order to clean the membrane from organic foulants by oxidation karkooti et al 2020 nevertheless anodic oxidation could also cause a long term destruction of the m5 membrane since polyamide is not resistant against oxidation the additional energy consumption at a cell voltage of 2 5 v and current density of 1 1 a m² results in 2 9 w m² of membrane surface at a flux of 100 l m² h the extra needed energy would be 0 03 kwh m ³ which is low compared to the specific energy needed for uf process of 0 3 0 5 kwh m ³ guo et al 2009 duplex gold coating was used to investigate electrosorptive uf process since it is a relatively simple method to generate a conductive membrane however it leads to additional material costs of about 20 per m² of membrane this would approximately double the cost the of a uf membrane module nevertheless it is possible to use cheaper metals such as silver 0 5 m² or conductive carbon based materials in order to generate a less expensive duplex coated membrane though when calculating the total specific costs per m³ of nf permeate the investment cost for the membrane modules play a subordinate role compared to the energy costs costa and pinho 2006 therefore even the application of a gold coated electrosorptive uf membrane could be economically beneficial due to the higher energy efficiency altogether application of electrosorptive uf process leads a membrane with high permeability between mf and uf with a high nom removal rate in the range of nf and is therefore breaking the selectivity permeability trade off fig 16 however the electrosorptive membrane needs to be regenerated periodically by reversing the potential at regeneration mode a concentrated desorbate is generated which needs to be disposed until now the ratio of electrosorptive filtration phase and desorption phase is 3 to 1 fig s7 which leads to a water recovery of 75 the water recovery could be increased by using a second filtration stage or optimization of the desorption phase e g faster desorption at higher negative desorption potential compared to conventional cathodic charging electrorepulsion of ecm the electrosorptive uf process proved to be more effective in enhancing the nom removal performance fig 16 moreover electrorepulsive filtration at negative surface potential needs to be operated in cross flow mode in order to avoid concentration polarization in contrast to this electrosorptive uf process shows full removal performance by simple and energy efficient dead end filtration 4 conclusions the key findings of this study are application of positive potentials leads to a substantial increase in permeability due to electro osmotic effect fouling was not found to be problematic the intrinsic charge of the membrane material determines the electrosorption capacity ecm with intrinsic positive m5 or negative up150 zeta potential may be applied for electrosorptive or electro repulsive filtration respectively electrosorption is largely reversible and can be used to either remove or concentrate charged dissolved organic substances electrosorption is highly dependent on ionic strengths in the absence of ions and electrical double layer no electrosorption and desorption can be observed at very high ionic strengths electrosorption is likewise limited due to the decreased charge of substances and sorption competition electrosorption of nom is dependent on ph because the charge of nom and the membranes material changes with varying ph electrosorptive uf may facilitates the use of positively charged mf uf membranes for separation tasks of nf membranes e g removal of refractory organic pollutants such as phenolic compounds pharmaceuticals dyes and pesticides overall we provided the proof of concept for energy efficient removal of charged organic molecules with a novel electrosorptive uf process
