15640,microplastics mps are a worldwide environmental pollution issue besides the natural environmental stresses various treatments in urban environmental management systems induce modifications on mps further affecting their environmental behavior investigating these modifications and inherent mechanisms is crucial for assessing the environmental impact and risk of mps in this review up to date knowledge regarding the modifications of mps in urban environmental management systems was summarized variations of morphology chemical composition hydrophilicity and specific surface area of mps were generalized the aging and degradation of mps during drinking water treatment wastewater treatment sewage sludge treatment and solid waste treatment were investigated a high abundance of mps occurred in sewage sludge and aging solid waste while digestion and composting contributed to significant decomposition and reduction of mps these treatments have become converters for mps before entering the environment several novel technologies for mps removal were listed however no appropriate methods can be put into actual application by now except the membrane separation the corresponding effects of degradation on the behaviors of mps including adsorption sinking and contaminant leakage were discussed finally three priorities for research were proposed this critical review provides viewpoints and references for risk evaluation of mps after treatments in urban environmental management systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords plastic debris aging activated sludge advanced oxidation processes membrane treatment data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction microplastics mps pollution has become a worldwide environmental issue borrelle et al 2020 rachman 2018 vethaak and legler 2021 plastic debris generally from 1 μm to 5 mm in diameter was defined as mps while those smaller than 1 μm were classified as nanoplastics nps andrady 2017 they have been demonstrated to induce toxic effects on living organisms posing great threats to aquatic ecosystems and human beings bolivar subirats et al 2021 kwon et al 2017 some features such as high specific surface area ssa high mobility low density high resistant and hydrophobicity endow their distinct behaviors typically mps can adsorb organic pollutants ma et al 2019b qiu et al 2019 heavy metals godoy et al 2019 bacteria hou et al 2021 wang et al 2020c and even resistance genes bank et al 2020 dong et al 2021 shi et al 2020 making them a chemical cocktail ye et al 2020 furthermore the low density 1 g cm3 and small size of mps enhance their long range transport capacity from pool to pool resulting in the spread in freshwater ocean soil and atmosphere around the whole planet rachman 2018 rochman and hoellein 2020 thus mp pollution is now an interdisciplinary issue and great efforts are required to address their challenge although mps are solid organic particles they can still be decomposed that is aging and degradation happen under different environmental conditions compared with larger sized plastics also defined as macroplastics which are 5 mm in diameter ramkumar et al 2022 the decomposition of mps induces more significant effects on their features and behaviors due to their small size such as the hydrophobicity density sinking adsorption etc chen et al 2022 lin et al 2020 2022 niu et al 2022 yang et al 2021a furthermore the leakage of additives would be aggravated beiras et al 2021 sorensen et al 2021 these phenomena enhance the uncertainty of their environmental fate vethaak and legler 2021 consequently investigating the modifications of mps has become an important issue in the natural environment various physical chemical and biological stresses induce irreversible modifications of mps including chemical bonds size shape etc accinelli et al 2019 brandon et al 2016 normally the actual mp modifications induced by environmental stresses are slow significant modifications will appear only after a long term maybe years decades process up to now some reviews regarding the mp modifications induced by environmental stresses have been published liu et al 2020b sun et al 2020 abundant mps have also been detected in various urban environmental management systems including drinking water treatment plants dwtps wastewater treatment plants wwtps sewage sludge treatment facilities and solid waste treatment facilities when mps go through these systems severe and rapid modifications happen for example mps were found in every stage from influent to effluent in the municipal wwtps carr et al 2016 vardar et al 2021 the biological physical and chemical processes in wwtps induce various modifications of mps features remarkably the chemical treatments such as chlorine and ultraviolet uv disinfection introduced visible degradation on mp surfaces kelkar et al 2019 lin et al 2020 after the water phase treatments in wwtps most mps typically 90 are transferred into sewage sludge this part of mps undergoes a series of sludge treatment processes such as thickening digestion and dewatering which are highly destructive xu et al 2021 thus more significant modifications occur in the sludge treatment besides water treatments solid waste treatments such as composting landfill incineration and recycling are also proven to degrade the embedded mps chen et al 2020 he et al 2019 nevertheless after all these different treatments mp residuals still exist they are finally transferred into the environmental water via wwtp effluent landfill leachate soil sludge utilization and even atmosphere pyroclastics from incineration golwala et al 2021 liu et al 2021 mbachu et al 2020 rillig and lehmann 2020 compared with virgin mps these modified mps present distinct characteristics and their behaviors will differ investigating these variations and inherent mechanisms is crucial for assessing mps related environmental impact and risk up to now some authors have summarized the removal efficiency of mps in wastewater treatments cristaldi et al 2020 liu et al 2021 turan et al 2021 and drinking water treatments cheng et al 2021 however the relevant modifications of mps during the passing of these treatments were neglected in this review up to date knowledge regarding the modifications of mps during passing urban environmental management systems was summarized and categorized the first aim was to introduce the degradation characteristics and the analysis methods applied to assess these characteristics of mps secondly the aging and degradation of mps passing a series of urban environmental management systems were summarized thirdly the removal and modifications of mps by novel treatment methods were investigated finally the corresponding effects of aging and degradation on the behaviors of mps including adsorption sinking and contaminant leakage were discussed 2 modification properties of mps and analysis methods 2 1 morphology usually the optical microscope and scanning electron microscope sem are applied for morphology investigation the optical microscope is used for the preliminary screening of mps from the mixture cao et al 2020 carr et al 2016 conley et al 2019 furthermore sem can obtain high resolution images including more detailed modifications e g wrinkle bubble cracking cavity etc on the surface of degraded mps mahon et al 2017 investigated the morphology of treated mps from sludge in a wwtp and distinct abrasions were observed including wrinkling melding blistering and fracturing for landfill samples critical decompositions such as cracking and fragmentation were observed on the polypropylene pp debris after five years of aging potrykus et al 2021 besides surface modifications the fragmentation of mps also contributes to the morphology modifications the fragmentation mechanism depended on the treatment methods and polymer types of mps with different surface properties klein et al 2018 song et al 2017 found that uv exposure and sand abrasion accelerated fragmentation and damage of ps mps causing many white fine particles inside the cracks interestingly sem detected no fragments with uv exposure alone implying that additional physical force mechanical stress contributed to this enhanced breaking mps passing through the sand filter during water treatment were broken down by mechanical stress resulting in further degradation probably due to friction and collision with surrounding debris enfrin et al 2019 other processes such as the mixing pumping or foaming may also cause fragmentation and morphology modifications of mps during transport and treatments in dwtps and wwtps for example pump cavitation erosion induced disruption of mps inevitably within the pump system during water transfer hutli et al 2019 in addition xu et al 2021 summarized the formation of smaller particles in wwtps consequently investigating morphological modifications provide useful information for revealing the fate of mps after various treatments 2 2 chemical structure microplastics are organic polymers composed of carbon oxygen covalent bonds variations in their chemical structures can be easily analyzed by micro fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and micro raman spectrum after various treatments multiple modifications of mp surface chemical structures occurred and the micro ftir and micro raman have become standard approaches to identify these variations wang et al 2020a investigated the mps samples in several wastewaters their raman data showed the appearance of broad moderate peaks in the range of 1300 1800 cm 1 suggesting the generation of c o bonds on the surfaces of all mps samples su et al 2019 used ftir to investigate the aging mps after a long term landfill they found that the abundance of surface co and c o structures raised in almost all mps the ftir can also diagnose changes in carbonyl bonds and hydroxyl and carbon oxygen bonds besides qualitative analysis some scholars have tried to excavate quantitative information from ftir data carbonyl index ci was used to characterize the oxidized extent of mp surface which was calculated by the absorption rate of carbonyl peaks related to methylene peaks liu et al 2019a it reflects the quantification of the changes in the chemical structure of the material especially the conversion of methylene to c o bond almond et al 2020 some advanced oxidation processes aops induced significant raises in ci values providing statistical evidence of surface oxidation on mps lin et al 2020 liu et al 2019b furthermore another method called two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos has been used to further investigate the degradation mechanism of mps lang et al 2020 mao et al 2020 it generated a synchronous and asynchronous correlation 2d correlation map fig s1 with noda s rules the intensity changes sequence of the characteristic peaks can be used to reflect the corresponding chemical bonds generation orders jin et al 2018 mao et al 2020 evaluated the aging of mps with uv irradiation and they found that the variations of chemical bonds on ps followed an order of 1450 1493 1601 ch 1030 co 1375 coh 1666 c o 1744 oc o cm 1 however ftir and raman could detect only carbon and oxygen bonds and their sensibility is relatively low more comprehensive data can be obtained after some other methods are gradually applied x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps can display the element composition and their bond valence status on the material surface in our previous study xps was used to evaluate the chemical variations of mps after 254 nm uv irradiation results showed that uv c irradiation increased the abundance of co and c o bonds on pe polyvinyl chloride pvc ps and pet on the contrary the ftir results only provided limited evidence lin et al 2020 up to now only ftir raman and xps have been applied more analytical methods are still required to comprehensively evaluate the modifications of mps after treatments 2 3 hydrophilicity the contact angle is a standard parameter representing surface hydrophilicity niu et al 2021 due to the organic polymer nature almost all pristine mps have relative hydrophobic surfaces with contact angles larger than 70 lin et al 2020 van melkebeke et al 2020 after various treatments the aging and degradation induced surface oxidation and degradation resulting in variations of hydrophilicity oxidation induced by aops decreased the contact angle liu et al 2019b in our previous study the contact angle of ps was reduced from 120 to 10 after 120 mj cm2 vacuum ultraviolet vuv irradiation which was attributed to the hydroxyl radical oxidation on mps lin et al 2020 biological processes such as biofouling also reduced the surface hydrophobicity of mps van melkebeke et al 2020 in general the hydrophobic surfaces of pristine mps can be easily transferred to hydrophilic ones after various treatments 2 4 specific surface area brunauer emmett teller method was used to identify specific surface area ssa with a unit at m2 g generally as larger the mp size as smaller the ssa in addition the polymer type also affects the ssa godoy et al 2019 hueffer and hofmann 2016 xu et al 2019 for example the 5 mm pe particle has an ssa at 1 4 m2 g while the 250 μm one is 0 3 m2 g which is close to 5 mm pet one at 0 35 m2 g godoy et al 2019 hueffer and hofmann 2016 some existing studies have investigated the ssa variations of mps after aging and degradation fotopoulou et al 2012 found that uv aging pe and pp pellets presented higher ssa than the pristine ones which can be attributed to the eroded surface with rough and uneven morphology liu et al 2019b used k2s2o8 oxidation and fenton treatment to degrade mps as the mps size decreased an inverse tendency was observed for the ssa of ps and pe mps liu et al 2019b the modification of ssa can affect the interactions adsorption between mps and other contaminants further changing the behaviors of mps in the environment 3 modifications of mps in urban environmental management systems 3 1 drinking water treatment the centralized dwtps are applied in every modern city unfortunately it has been confirmed that mps penetrated a series of treatments into the final finished water of dwtps mintenig et al 2019 mortensen et al 2021 pivokonsky et al 2018 and they were directly transported to users therefore the modifications induced by various treatment methods in dwtps will increase the uncertainty of their risk to drinking water safety traditional drinking water treatment processes include coagulation precipitation filtration and disinfection the first three processes contributed to 60 99 removal of mps in source water hidayaturrahman and lee 2019 pivokonsky et al 2018 2020 wang et al 2020f they are all dominated by physical processes which negatively affect mps the effects induced by precipitation and filtration are negligible even coagulation only covers inorganic polymers and salts on the mp surfaces but not degradation xia et al 2020 zhang et al 2020c usually the disinfections in dwtps include chlorination uv and ozonation which are highly destructive for chlorination chlorine gas cl2 or sodium hypochlorite naclo is added to water and both ways generate hypochlorous acid hclo and hypochlorite clo these active components inactivate most of the bacteria and viruses in water for uv disinfection mercury lamps emitting 254 nm irradiation are applied this high energy uv penetrates cell walls and membranes to destroy dna and rna resulting in apoptosis and death of pathogens james and bolton 2008 for ozonation it induces oxidation of the pathogens resulting in the inactivation of even worms in water furthermore the organic contaminants in water can be degraded by ozone rapidly wang and wang 2020 generally the effects of disinfection on mps are highly dependent on dose a low dose concentration time ct value ct at 150 mg min l chlorination induced slight degradation kelkar et al 2019 on the contrary a high dose exposure ct at 25 g d l resulted in surface chemical degradation on pp hdpe and ps similarly hydroxylated modifications were observed on mps after high dose 254 nm uv treatment lin et al 2020 wang et al 2020e wu et al 2020 for ozonation its highly oxidative capacity induced decomposition on mps tian et al 2017 most of these studies focused on modifications of morphology and chemical structures on mps however the potential generation of disinfection by products from mps induced by these disinfection methods is still a mystery furthermore the modifications of mps in water supply networks under long term residual chlorine exposure are unknown besides disinfection to improve the treatment performance some pre treatments and advanced treatments are applied to dwtps chen et al 2022 hidayaturrahman and lee 2019 wang et al 2020f the pre treatments usually refer to pre oxidation and pre chlorination since the concentrations of mps in the source water are relatively high investigating the modifications of mps during pre treatments is significant but there is still no report on this topic the advanced treatments are usually set at the end of dwtps including various aops and membrane separation their effects on mps are discussed in section 4 3 2 wastewater treatment wwtps receive almost all the municipal wastewater and part of industrial wastewater from modern cities a series of primary secondary and tertiary treatments are applied in wwtps most wwtps contain only primary and secondary treatments and their targeted contaminants do not include mps nevertheless the overall removal rate of mps in these wwtps still reached 70 99 shen et al 2020 sun et al 2019 the primary treatments are mainly mechanical interception and physical precipitation such as bar screening air flotation and primary sedimentation removing large suspended particles from wastewater due to the small sizes mps are difficult to be intercepted by the bar screening in addition the low density of most mps can endow them with the capacity to float on the water surfaces resulting in low removal efficiency during sedimentation on the contrary air flotation may be an efficient method but its applications in wwtps are rarer than sedimentation the secondary treatment applies various biological methods mainly biofilm activated sludge processes followed by secondary sedimentation it was widely believed that these traditional treatments had limited effects on the degradation and aging of mps only transporting the mps from wastewater to sewage sludge he et al 2019 the majority of mps seem to be transferred into the sewage sludge but the remained mp residuals were still discharged along with the effluent to the received water bodies furthermore tertiary treatments including advanced oxidation membrane separation etc are applied in some wwtps chong et al 2010 lares et al 2018 lv et al 2019 ma et al 2019a unexpectedly a tertiary wwtp that applied membrane filtration still discharged mps to the effluent with removal rates in the range of 70 90 bayo et al 2020 ziajahromi et al 2017 many works have focused on the removal efficiencies of mps in wwtps table s1 akarsu et al 2020 alvim et al 2020 carr et al 2016 dris et al 2015 kittipongvises et al 2022 liu et al 2019c ren et al 2020 talvitie et al 2017b zhang et al 2021a all these studies indicated that the regular secondary treatments in wwtps cannot wholly remove mps resulting in many mps being released into the natural aquatic environment some studies have reported the characteristics variations of mps in different treatments such as the polymer type shape and color akarsu et al 2020 investigated the shape distribution of mps in three turkish wwtps the overall removal efficiencies of these three wwtps were in the range of 48 73 the mp sizes in the influent of these wwtps were similar with dominant polymers of pp and pe the main shapes were particle and fiber with the colors crystal transparent brown and black after treatments the mps in the effluent were still pp and pe fibers but the number of hard plastics had increased with the primary colors of crystal transparent orange or purple kelly et al 2021 evaluated the mps and associated biofilms within the influent effluent and sludge of two wwtps in dupage the overall removal rate of mps reached 99 the dominant mps in influent were fibers but the ones in effluent were particles the biological composition of mps was also different after treatments the abundance of some potentially pathogenic bacterial taxa e g campylobacteraceae decreased suggesting the modifications of microplastic associated assemblages tang et al 2020 compared the modifications of mps in two wwtps in wuhan china the dominant mps in the influents were pvc fibers and fragments with the colors of white black and transparent the overall removal rates of fibers and fragments were 66 and 63 respectively after a series of physical and chemical processes some modifications such as crushing and corrosion were observed on mps and their size decreased only a few cases have tracked the changes in morphology material and status of mps during wastewater treatments this may be due to the lack of tracking techniques of mps in wwtps resulting in the knowledge gap about the entire fate of specific mps the impact of wastewater treatments on mp is essential to predict their behavior and fate after entering the environment thus further research and data are still required 3 3 sewage sludge treatment in the primary treatment of wwtps inorganic particles with abundant large scale mps are settled by grit and primary sedimentation basins furthermore excess activated sludge is formed in biological treatment stages containing mps after these two treatment stages more than 75 of mps were removed and transferred into the sludge jiang et al 2020 long et al 2019 the concentration of mps in the sludge of 28 sewage treatment plants in china reached 22 7 12 1 103 particles per kilogram dry sludge li et al 2018b while pp and pe were the dominant mps zhang et al 2020b unlike the wastewater treatments sludge treatment processes could induce significant modifications to mps table s2 sludge treatments contain concentration conditioning stabilization and drying processes generally various destructions including abrasive stripping bubbling etc occurred on the mp surfaces after sludge treatments li et al 2018b firstly the concentration and conditioning processes aim to reduce the moisture content of the sludge by mechanical methods which only have limited effects on mps li et al 2018b on the contrary stabilization is highly destructive to mps it usually includes anaerobic and aerobic digestion aiming at converting sludge into sterile products the digestion in sludge treatment contributed to the reduction in the abundance and size of mps in the sludge zhang et al 2020a another research found that the anaerobic digestion of the kitchen waste caused aging and fragmentation of polylactic acid mps with irregular cracking and tiny daughter particles lu et al 2022 xu et al 2020 found that the predominant shape of mps in the effluent of a wwtp was microfiber while it was particles and fragments in its digested sludge this can be attributed to the biological degradation of microfibers into smaller parts during digestion in addition mahon et al 2017 found that the abundance of mps decreased after degradation of anaerobic digestion resulting in shredding and flaking of mps thermal drying is also a common used method for sludge treatment it was found that blisters and cracks appeared on mp surfaces after thermal drying mahon et al 2017 the abundance of mps significantly increased after thermal hydrolysis treatment li et al 2022 this might be due to high temperature and mechanical mixing leading to shear splitting of mps mahon et al 2017 on the contrary some studies reported different results li et al 2022 compared the effects of thermal drying and thermal hydrolysis on sludge mps and it seemed that thermal hydrolysis contributed to an increase in mps abundance but thermal drying had no influence another research also found that no significant difference of mp abundance occurred in sludge before and after thermal drying edo et al 2020 these different results can be attributed to the operating conditions and modes of sludge drying technology for example the temperature of sludge drying drum stirring speed stirring mode etc up to now only a few studies have been reported and more detailed and comprehensive research are required after sludge treatments mps size tended to be smaller with various deconstructions on their surface these mps are usually transferred to solid waste treatments such as composting and incineration the former one would transform sludge into biosolids which were used as a fertilizer and soil conditioner for agricultural usage koyuncuoglu and erden 2021 after incineration the sludge was burned into ash containing mps residual yang et al 2021b thus sewage sludge is also a vehicle for mps to enter the environment 3 4 solid waste treatments the surface morphology and environmental behaviors of mps may be further changed as sludge enters the solid waste treatment processes composting is a common solid waste treatment technique bernal et al 2009 wang et al 2018 which can effectively reduce or eliminate pathogens and organic pollutants in sludge chen et al 2020 mercier et al 2017 typically mps are enriched in excess sludge in wwtps subsequently they are transported to sludge treatment facilities some excess sludge is used for composting and eventually as agricultural fertilizer thus mps in sludge are transferred to the composting process which can alter their characteristics even changing their abundance fig 3 sun et al 2021b conducted a lab scale composting with 0 5 mps in the mixture of cow manure and sawdust for 60 days mps size and polymer types both had effects on the degradation performance they found that the abundance of small size mps 0 800 μm decreased significantly but pvc was difficult to be degraded furthermore the surfaces of all mps suffered evident erosions and cracks and the oxidized functional groups such as oh oc and o c increased their results indicated significant decompositions of mps after composting chen et al 2020 investigated a full scale composting facility and a 43 7 removal of mps was reported the mechanism in a lab scale experiment was explored and they found that hyperthermophilic bacteria played an important role evident pits and cavities were observed on the surface of composted mps which were eroded by these bacteria fig 3a d they concluded that the high temperature composting could be a potential method for mps reduction fig 3e and f watteau et al 2018 other studies pointed out that composting significantly impacted the size distribution of mps where larger mps were converted into smaller ones chen et al 2020 el hayany et al 2020 it was reported that composting increased the abundance of mps due to the release of small sized mps from the degraded macroplastics fig 3g j gui et al 2021 li et al 2022 the breakdown of mps might be induced by mechanical forces of the compost turning operation and chemical oxidation gui et al 2021 however ei hayany et al 2020 found that composting affected the size distribution and micro morphology of mps but not its abundance this might be because the microorganisms in their system had no capacity for mps degradation under the applied conditions conventional composting can change the mps abundance to some extent which is highly dependent on the compositing temperature and specific microbial community a global evaluation of more cases and samples is required to assess the modification of mps during composting since it cannot eliminate mps completely its product fertilizer may be a potential vehicle for mps into the environment the landfill is confirmed to store 21 42 of global plastic waste production nizzetto et al 2016 in landfills it is usually in an anaerobic environment and abundant macroplastics can be easily decomposed into mps mahon et al 2017 he et al 2019 proposed that the generation accumulation and release of mps from landfills was a long term process another research in norway reported leaking mps from landfills sundt et al 2014 su et al 2019 investigated mp abundance size and polymer composition variation patterns during a long term landfill more mps were detected in the young and medium landfills and their abundance decreased in the aged ones of note mps were detected in leachate from landfills narevski et al 2021 sun et al 2021a and the leachate treatment system contributed to the limited removal of mps zhang et al 2021b reported that a pretreatment biotreatment advanced treatment process removed only 50 of mps in leachate with complete elimination of small mps 0 5 mm incineration was considered a terminator of most solid waste including mps however the latest studies have confirmed that unburned materials in the bottom ash from incinerators still contained mps and the mps abundance in it reached 1 9 565 particles kg after incineration yang et al 2021b various polymer types and shapes of mps were found in the bottom ash this suggested that it could still be a vector of mps to the environment another research in china reported that tear marks protrusions and scratches were observed on the mp surface after incineration jian et al 2020 furthermore unexpected increments of heavy metals such as cu cd pb zn cr etc were found on the surface of mps in the bottom ash suggesting an increasing risk of these released mps shen et al 2021 4 mps removal and modification by novel methods since the existing traditional treatments cannot wholly remove mps from drinking water wastewater and solid waste it is desirable to develop novel methods to improve the removal efficiency of mps evaluation of some efforts has been made 4 1 membrane separation membrane separation is already applied in drinking water treatments and wastewater treatments theoretically even the largest pore size of microfiltration is smaller than 0 1 μm suggesting that they can eliminate micro level mps quickly ma et al 2019a whereas the practical membranes still contain pores much larger than their apparent pore size due to the manufacturing standards techniques and imperfections park et al 2017 thus some mps still penetrated the membrane into the effluent lv et al 2019 of note this unexpected phenomenon could happen for nano plastics which were smaller than the pore size of the membrane due to the limitation of detection techniques for nano plastics there is still no evidence for this hypothesis however it cannot be denied that membrane separation presented efficient and ideal performance on mps removal li et al 2018a talvitie et al 2017a membrane reactor mbr is widely applied in wastewater treatment talvitie et al 2017a found that mbr had the best performance removal 95 compared to rapid sand filter dissolved air flotation and disk filter another wwtp applied mbr technique contributed to a total removal efficiency of mps at 99 5 with 0 028 0 01 mg l mps in their effluent lv et al 2019 lares et al 2018 investigated a wwtp with a traditional activated sludge technique in finland and it contained a pilot mbr system only 0 5 particles l mps were detected in the effluent of the pilot mbr bayo et al 2020 used an mbr system to further treat a wwtp final effluent an eighty month monitoring was performed and better removal efficiency of particulate mps compared to microfibers was observed but without statistically significant differences between polymer types however some weaknesses such as membrane fouling and membrane deterioration cannot be ignored the latest study verified that mps aggravated these phenomena ma et al 2019a mps presented negative effects on sludge formation hydrophobicity and extracellular polymeric substance generation in mbr maliwan et al 2021 furthermore the potential release of mps from membrane modules is another thorny issue during actual operations such as membrane washing which may contribute to excessive mp pollution ding et al 2021 considering membrane techniques are typically used as the final process in dwtps and the tertiary treatment in wwtps the unexpected release of mps from membrane modules should be paid attention to further improvements in the removal efficiency through some specially designed approaches such as enzymatic membrane reactor assembled with some specific bacterium could make the membrane technique a promising method to fulfill the complete elimination of mps poerio et al 2019 yoshida et al 2016 4 2 tio2 photocatalysis tio2 photocatalysis is a type of environment friendly treatment technology based on the electronic transition reaction of photocatalysts cedillo gonzalez et al 2018 through the electronic transition a series of activated radicals such as hydroxyl radicals oh are generated and they degrade organic pollutants in multiple matrixes nakata and fujishima 2012 for organic polymers such as mps photocatalytic reactions have been proven effective camila ariza tarazona et al 2020 the degradation mechanism of mps by photocatalysis is mainly the oxidation of their organic skeleton induced by radicals tio2 is the most common photocatalyst in various applications and products nakata and fujishima 2012 paumo et al 2021 several attempts have been conducted to test the potential of tio2 photocatalysis for mps degradation nabi et al 2020 tested the degradation of 400 nm ps and pe microspheres using a tio2 nanoparticle film made by triton x 100 it demonstrated a relatively fast photocatalysis 98 removal within 12 h and the degradation mechanism was confirmed to be radical oxidation resulting in the production of hydroxyl carbonyl and carbon hydrogen groups luo et al 2021a synthesized a nano tio2 coated pp mps and they found that the photocatalysis occurred around the nano tio2 particles in mps which accelerated the softening and aging of pp mps wang et al 2019 proposed a novel strategy to eliminate mps using photocatalytic micromotors au mag tio2 mag ni fe and it presented an excellent collection and removal of mps in water in addition some other modified tio2 have been developed for the degradation of mps n tio2 compared with the pristine tio2 is more sustainable zeng et al 2015 camila ariza tarazona et al 2019 extracted hdpe mps from facial scrubs and used n tio2 based semiconductors to degrade these hdpe mps they found that the environmental conditions mps n tio2 interaction and the n tio2 surface area should be carefully adjusted to maintain the photocatalytic degradation rate a biologically inspired c n tio2 photocatalyst was developed in their further research they found that low temperature and low ph benefited the interaction between mps and tio2 camila ariza tarazona et al 2020 these studies suggested that applying tio2 photocatalysis required delicate controlling and monitoring of reaction conditions to ensure their efficiency generally the existing studies have shown the potential of photocatalytic degradation of mps the photocatalytic technology relies on indirect oxidation of mps by radicals and produces harmless byproducts however mps are solid organic polymers even if they have tiny sizes a relatively long photocatalytic time and a large amount of photocatalyst are indispensable to achieving their complete degradation and mineralization furthermore the low quantum yield of photocatalysts including tio2 is still a bottleneck for their applications the photocatalytic degradation of mps still requires further innovative research 4 3 other advanced oxidation processes aops besides photocatalysis some other aops including fenton oxidation ozonation and vuv have been tested for the degradation of mps fenton treatment accelerates the mps degradation with highly oxidative free radicals i e oh in the presence of fe2 h2o2 is transformed to oh and other oxidative species in water liu et al 2019b reported that significant alternations of surface morphology size distribution hydrophobicity and chemical feature occurred after fenton treatment they found that the surface alterations of pe were more intense than ps these alterations enhanced the adsorption capacity of mps liu et al 2019a mueller et al 2018 miao et al 2020 demonstrated that the electro fenton like technology based on tio2 c cathode successfully degraded pvc mps with a 56 wt removal the dominant mechanism was confirmed to be oh oxidation resulting in the breakage of pvc backbone of note fenton oxidation is now widely used as the pre treatment for mp extraction from field samples in which the degradation of mps should be considered carefully ozonation is a highly destructive method to degrade contaminants up to now some studies have tested its effectiveness on mps degradation tian et al 2017 have found that ozone induced several alterations in ps including the fragments and formation of carbonyl groups under 189 mg l ozonation tian et al 2017 in actual treatments this ozone concentration is exceptionally high pulido reyes et al 2020 studied the modifications of mps under the actual ozone concentration applied in water treatment lake water was used as the experiment matrix and no visible alteration in ps and polyacrylonitrile was observed the hydrodynamic diameter and aggregation state of mps remained steady under 0 5 5 mg l ozonation pulido reyes et al 2020 in a full scale advanced dwtp mps 1 5 μm from the ozonation effluent even increased by 2 8 16 0 resulting in a negative removal but a combination process of ozonation and granular activated carbon filtration has improved the removal efficiency of mps by 17 2 22 2 compared to traditional treatments wang et al 2020f additionally vuv which emits both 254 nm and 185 nm irradiation is a novel aop for water treatment the high energy 185 nm irradiation splits the h2o molecule to generate oh in water matrixes thus it also induced decomposition of mps mainly depending on the irradiation dose lin et al 2020 applied vuv irradiation to degrade four types of mps including ps pe pvc and pet and they found that significant alternations in morphology and chemical feature occurred on mp surface for example the surfaces of pvc mps showed some bubble structures after vuv treatment fig 5 c and d the modifications on mp surfaces weaken their adsorption of ciprofloxacin several combined aops techniques have also been developed for the elimination of mps for instance amelia et al 2021 reported that the combination of ozonation and h2o2 had a synergistic degradation effect on pe through radical based oxidation other combination methods such as the electro fenton like process miao et al 2020 and uv tio2 technique lee et al 2020 were tested to be available for the degradation of mps an existing review has covered the overview of some aops for removing mps ricardo et al 2021 generally the degradation mechanism of mps by these aops is the oxidation induced by free radicals since the generation efficiency of radicals is relatively low they may only be significant for nps and small size mps several micrometers degradation but not for large mps using aops for mps elimination is still far from actual application 5 effects of aging and degradation on the behaviors of mps 5 1 adsorption of heavy metals the influences on heavy metals adsorption induced by various treatments are summarized here most existing research focused on water treatments and only limited studies have reported sludge treatments the adsorption mechanism of heavy metals on mps included van der waals force electrostatic interaction and complexation ashton et al 2010 godoy et al 2019 holmes et al 2014 the modifications of mp characteristics such as surface chemical structure shape hydrophilicity and ssa can affect the interactions between mps and heavy metals the density and distribution of distinct functional groups especially oxygen containing structures on mps can be altered by physicochemical methods in water treatments affecting the sorption equilibria of heavy metals guo and wang 2021 town et al 2018 wang et al 2020d used uv a at 313 nm to degrade pet debris in water and the mp surfaces presented increasing ssa and oxidized functional groups as a result the adsorption of cu2 and zn2 was enhanced similar phenomena were observed for uv treated ps microspheres mao et al 2020 in another study fenton oxidation of ps mps was conducted their results showed that more adsorption sites were exposed on the surface promoting the adsorption of cd2 on ps mps lang et al 2020 furthermore polar functional groups such as ketones generated on aged mps were verified to facilitate the interaction with heavy metals wang et al 2017 generally after various treatments the characteristic chemical structures on mps may be changed affecting their adsorption of heavy metals the particle size was also considered a significant factor affecting the adsorption and some treatment processes in wwtps changed the mp size rochman et al 2015 mps can be broken into smaller fragments with the aged surface generating more adsorption sites and reactive surface areas promoting adsorption qiao et al 2019 reported that small size mps had higher adsorption capacities furthermore the alkaline hydrolysis used in the lime stabilization process sheared the granular mps resulting in an increased abundance of heavy metals on the surface bradney et al 2019 besides water treatments sludge treatments can also change the surface oxidation degree li et al 2019 collected sewage sludge samples from three wwtps they detected cd cu and co on the sludge based mps indicating that the sludge based mps accumulated metals during treatments similar to aged mps compared to pristine mps the adsorption potentials of the sludge based mps to heavy metals increased by approximately one order of magnitude this may be due to the functional groups generated on the mps having a higher affinity with heavy metal ions 5 2 adsorption of organic matter for organic contaminants van der waals force h bonds and electrostatic interaction dominate the chemical adsorption capacity it is also affected by the hydrophobicity ssa and surface electric charge status of mps the uv c disinfection at 254 nm decreased the hydrophobicity of ps pet and pvc and their adsorption of phenol declined lin et al 2020 similar results were reported by hueffer et al 2018 they found that the adsorption capacities of aged ps to twenty one organic probe sorbates were weakened by uv c irradiation furthermore wu et al 2020 found that uv aging negatively affected the adsorption of 2 2 4 4 tetrabromodiphenyl ether by ps mps which was also due to the declining hydrophobicity in general the decreasing hydrophobicity induced by surface oxidation contributed to the weakening adsorption of organic contaminants the octanol water partition coefficients logkow of organic contaminants had linear correlations with their adsorption on particular mps theoretically an organic contaminant with a higher logkow would adsorb on the hydrophobic mps more easily the modifications induced by various treatments would change the surface hydrophobicity of mps resulting in modifications to their adsorption capacities lan et al 2021 investigated the adsorption of four pesticides on pe films after field aging sunlight rain etc the adsorption capacity presented different variations which depended on pesticide types the authors concluded that this phenomenon was attributed to different logkow of pesticides which are influenced by the hydrophobic partitioning rather than by electrostatic forces or interactions another report contributed to consistent results liu et al 2020a on the contrary zhang et al 2018 collected natural aging mp debris from coastal beaches of north china compared to the pristine mps they found that the adsorption of oxytetracycline by aging mps was enhanced actual aging samples may suffer various degradation processes which is more elusive than the laboratory samples thus the actual effect on adsorption induced by various urban environmental management systems would involve complicated mechanisms some dimension reduction methods such as principle component analysis may be useful to identify the dominating factor affecting the adsorption capacities of mps after different treatments yet no study presents a relevant case so far 5 3 sinking capacity in an aqueous medium the sinking capacity of mps is crucial to their distribution the density size shape and roughness of mps affect the sinking velocity which may change during various treatments there is little direct evidence between the mp modifications and their sinking capacity several existing studies have provided some clues kaiser et al 2017 incubated ps and pe mps in river estuary and seashore for six weeks and they evaluated the sinking capacity of these mps it was found that the obtained biofouling increased the sinking velocities of ps by 16 in river water and 81 in marine water but it was not valid for pe they concluded that the biofouling attachments weakened the effect of density differences between particle and fluid over time resulting in the increasing sinking velocities in another study the mp shapes which are associated with the sphericity index were identified as the decisive factor kowalski et al 2016 the theoretical values of sinking velocity were calculated based on perfectly rounded spheres sphericity index 1 after the disruptive processes in various treatments mps tend to be irregular resulting in declining sinking velocities our previous studies investigated the sinking behaviors of mps after disinfection and permanganate pre oxidation chen et al 2022 lin et al 2022 it was found that uv and permanganate treatments enhanced the sinking behaviors of ps pet and pvc but not for pe furthermore the chlorination disinfection had a contrary effect indeed more proofs are still required to reveal the intrinsic mechanisms 5 4 contaminants release it is well known that the mps continuously release contaminants into the environments including the acquired contaminants and the inherent additives after aging and degradation this phenomenon is enhanced bandow et al 2017 used photooxidative and thermo oxidative treatments and the release of organic compounds and inorganic cl ca2 cu2 and zn2 from mps were all accelerated pigments are released under photooxidative aging for example the lead chromate pigmented mps released its monomer e g cr pb into the water increasing the potential risk of mps aging luo et al 2020a thermal decomposition and advanced oxidation of mps accelerated the release of pigments luo et al 2020c 2021b besides the tio2 added in some degradable plastics could be a potential derived contaminant from mps luo et al 2020b found that the release of tio2 particles from aged mps was faster than the pristine ones it can be inferred that the aging and degradation during treatment processes enhanced the release of contaminants from mps due to their accelerating degradation this increased the potential risk of mps up to now only limited information has been reported regarding this finding and further research is urgently needed 5 5 antibiotic resistance genes args recently args are emerging pollutants that have caused many adverse effects the horizontal gene transfer process is one of the important pathways for the emergence of antibiotic resistance genes qin et al 2020 the presence of mps aggravated the horizontal gene transfer of args wang et al 2020b found that mps enriched for args with different profiles electively might be sites for horizontal gene transfer another study reported that pvc mps adsorbed args and bacterial pathogens wu et al 2019 shen et al 2019 suggested that mps facilitated gene exchange among attached microbial communities leading to the spread of antibiotic resistant and causative genes yet the effects of treatment inducing modifications on the attachments of microorganisms and args remain scarce 6 conclusion and outlook summarizing the modifications of mps during different urban environmental management systems table s3 it was found that in dwtps disinfection methods induce evident degradation on mps for wwtps the sludge treatments showed decomposition on mps various solid waste treatments such as compost and anaerobic digestion induced a reduction of mps through biological degradation however regardless treatment method used mps were not completely eliminated but transferred from one matrix to another eventually released into the environment thus all these treatments are not only the vehicles but also the converters for mps before they enter the environment more attention should be paid to the modifications of mps during full scale disinfection in dwtps and the water supply network furthermore the effects of traditional biological treatments in wwtps on mps also require further study various treatments would change the characteristics of mps which affected their behaviors in the environment at present the adsorption sinking and contaminants release of mps have been confirmed to be affected by different treatments however the existing knowledge is still limited other behaviors such as migration fragmentation and additives leaching are still unknown significant efforts are still required to reveal the behavior and risk modifications of mps after various urban environmental management systems up to now there is still a lack of efficient methods for mps elimination considering the direct ingestion of mps through drinking water it is desirable to develop practicable methods for mps removal in dwtps membrane separation may be a terminal interception of mps furthermore mps are finally enriched in sludge and solid waste thus some novel techniques aiming at the targeted removal of mps from these matrixes are essential to reduce their environmental impact declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

15640,microplastics mps are a worldwide environmental pollution issue besides the natural environmental stresses various treatments in urban environmental management systems induce modifications on mps further affecting their environmental behavior investigating these modifications and inherent mechanisms is crucial for assessing the environmental impact and risk of mps in this review up to date knowledge regarding the modifications of mps in urban environmental management systems was summarized variations of morphology chemical composition hydrophilicity and specific surface area of mps were generalized the aging and degradation of mps during drinking water treatment wastewater treatment sewage sludge treatment and solid waste treatment were investigated a high abundance of mps occurred in sewage sludge and aging solid waste while digestion and composting contributed to significant decomposition and reduction of mps these treatments have become converters for mps before entering the environment several novel technologies for mps removal were listed however no appropriate methods can be put into actual application by now except the membrane separation the corresponding effects of degradation on the behaviors of mps including adsorption sinking and contaminant leakage were discussed finally three priorities for research were proposed this critical review provides viewpoints and references for risk evaluation of mps after treatments in urban environmental management systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords plastic debris aging activated sludge advanced oxidation processes membrane treatment data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction microplastics mps pollution has become a worldwide environmental issue borrelle et al 2020 rachman 2018 vethaak and legler 2021 plastic debris generally from 1 μm to 5 mm in diameter was defined as mps while those smaller than 1 μm were classified as nanoplastics nps andrady 2017 they have been demonstrated to induce toxic effects on living organisms posing great threats to aquatic ecosystems and human beings bolivar subirats et al 2021 kwon et al 2017 some features such as high specific surface area ssa high mobility low density high resistant and hydrophobicity endow their distinct behaviors typically mps can adsorb organic pollutants ma et al 2019b qiu et al 2019 heavy metals godoy et al 2019 bacteria hou et al 2021 wang et al 2020c and even resistance genes bank et al 2020 dong et al 2021 shi et al 2020 making them a chemical cocktail ye et al 2020 furthermore the low density 1 g cm3 and small size of mps enhance their long range transport capacity from pool to pool resulting in the spread in freshwater ocean soil and atmosphere around the whole planet rachman 2018 rochman and hoellein 2020 thus mp pollution is now an interdisciplinary issue and great efforts are required to address their challenge although mps are solid organic particles they can still be decomposed that is aging and degradation happen under different environmental conditions compared with larger sized plastics also defined as macroplastics which are 5 mm in diameter ramkumar et al 2022 the decomposition of mps induces more significant effects on their features and behaviors due to their small size such as the hydrophobicity density sinking adsorption etc chen et al 2022 lin et al 2020 2022 niu et al 2022 yang et al 2021a furthermore the leakage of additives would be aggravated beiras et al 2021 sorensen et al 2021 these phenomena enhance the uncertainty of their environmental fate vethaak and legler 2021 consequently investigating the modifications of mps has become an important issue in the natural environment various physical chemical and biological stresses induce irreversible modifications of mps including chemical bonds size shape etc accinelli et al 2019 brandon et al 2016 normally the actual mp modifications induced by environmental stresses are slow significant modifications will appear only after a long term maybe years decades process up to now some reviews regarding the mp modifications induced by environmental stresses have been published liu et al 2020b sun et al 2020 abundant mps have also been detected in various urban environmental management systems including drinking water treatment plants dwtps wastewater treatment plants wwtps sewage sludge treatment facilities and solid waste treatment facilities when mps go through these systems severe and rapid modifications happen for example mps were found in every stage from influent to effluent in the municipal wwtps carr et al 2016 vardar et al 2021 the biological physical and chemical processes in wwtps induce various modifications of mps features remarkably the chemical treatments such as chlorine and ultraviolet uv disinfection introduced visible degradation on mp surfaces kelkar et al 2019 lin et al 2020 after the water phase treatments in wwtps most mps typically 90 are transferred into sewage sludge this part of mps undergoes a series of sludge treatment processes such as thickening digestion and dewatering which are highly destructive xu et al 2021 thus more significant modifications occur in the sludge treatment besides water treatments solid waste treatments such as composting landfill incineration and recycling are also proven to degrade the embedded mps chen et al 2020 he et al 2019 nevertheless after all these different treatments mp residuals still exist they are finally transferred into the environmental water via wwtp effluent landfill leachate soil sludge utilization and even atmosphere pyroclastics from incineration golwala et al 2021 liu et al 2021 mbachu et al 2020 rillig and lehmann 2020 compared with virgin mps these modified mps present distinct characteristics and their behaviors will differ investigating these variations and inherent mechanisms is crucial for assessing mps related environmental impact and risk up to now some authors have summarized the removal efficiency of mps in wastewater treatments cristaldi et al 2020 liu et al 2021 turan et al 2021 and drinking water treatments cheng et al 2021 however the relevant modifications of mps during the passing of these treatments were neglected in this review up to date knowledge regarding the modifications of mps during passing urban environmental management systems was summarized and categorized the first aim was to introduce the degradation characteristics and the analysis methods applied to assess these characteristics of mps secondly the aging and degradation of mps passing a series of urban environmental management systems were summarized thirdly the removal and modifications of mps by novel treatment methods were investigated finally the corresponding effects of aging and degradation on the behaviors of mps including adsorption sinking and contaminant leakage were discussed 2 modification properties of mps and analysis methods 2 1 morphology usually the optical microscope and scanning electron microscope sem are applied for morphology investigation the optical microscope is used for the preliminary screening of mps from the mixture cao et al 2020 carr et al 2016 conley et al 2019 furthermore sem can obtain high resolution images including more detailed modifications e g wrinkle bubble cracking cavity etc on the surface of degraded mps mahon et al 2017 investigated the morphology of treated mps from sludge in a wwtp and distinct abrasions were observed including wrinkling melding blistering and fracturing for landfill samples critical decompositions such as cracking and fragmentation were observed on the polypropylene pp debris after five years of aging potrykus et al 2021 besides surface modifications the fragmentation of mps also contributes to the morphology modifications the fragmentation mechanism depended on the treatment methods and polymer types of mps with different surface properties klein et al 2018 song et al 2017 found that uv exposure and sand abrasion accelerated fragmentation and damage of ps mps causing many white fine particles inside the cracks interestingly sem detected no fragments with uv exposure alone implying that additional physical force mechanical stress contributed to this enhanced breaking mps passing through the sand filter during water treatment were broken down by mechanical stress resulting in further degradation probably due to friction and collision with surrounding debris enfrin et al 2019 other processes such as the mixing pumping or foaming may also cause fragmentation and morphology modifications of mps during transport and treatments in dwtps and wwtps for example pump cavitation erosion induced disruption of mps inevitably within the pump system during water transfer hutli et al 2019 in addition xu et al 2021 summarized the formation of smaller particles in wwtps consequently investigating morphological modifications provide useful information for revealing the fate of mps after various treatments 2 2 chemical structure microplastics are organic polymers composed of carbon oxygen covalent bonds variations in their chemical structures can be easily analyzed by micro fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and micro raman spectrum after various treatments multiple modifications of mp surface chemical structures occurred and the micro ftir and micro raman have become standard approaches to identify these variations wang et al 2020a investigated the mps samples in several wastewaters their raman data showed the appearance of broad moderate peaks in the range of 1300 1800 cm 1 suggesting the generation of c o bonds on the surfaces of all mps samples su et al 2019 used ftir to investigate the aging mps after a long term landfill they found that the abundance of surface co and c o structures raised in almost all mps the ftir can also diagnose changes in carbonyl bonds and hydroxyl and carbon oxygen bonds besides qualitative analysis some scholars have tried to excavate quantitative information from ftir data carbonyl index ci was used to characterize the oxidized extent of mp surface which was calculated by the absorption rate of carbonyl peaks related to methylene peaks liu et al 2019a it reflects the quantification of the changes in the chemical structure of the material especially the conversion of methylene to c o bond almond et al 2020 some advanced oxidation processes aops induced significant raises in ci values providing statistical evidence of surface oxidation on mps lin et al 2020 liu et al 2019b furthermore another method called two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos has been used to further investigate the degradation mechanism of mps lang et al 2020 mao et al 2020 it generated a synchronous and asynchronous correlation 2d correlation map fig s1 with noda s rules the intensity changes sequence of the characteristic peaks can be used to reflect the corresponding chemical bonds generation orders jin et al 2018 mao et al 2020 evaluated the aging of mps with uv irradiation and they found that the variations of chemical bonds on ps followed an order of 1450 1493 1601 ch 1030 co 1375 coh 1666 c o 1744 oc o cm 1 however ftir and raman could detect only carbon and oxygen bonds and their sensibility is relatively low more comprehensive data can be obtained after some other methods are gradually applied x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps can display the element composition and their bond valence status on the material surface in our previous study xps was used to evaluate the chemical variations of mps after 254 nm uv irradiation results showed that uv c irradiation increased the abundance of co and c o bonds on pe polyvinyl chloride pvc ps and pet on the contrary the ftir results only provided limited evidence lin et al 2020 up to now only ftir raman and xps have been applied more analytical methods are still required to comprehensively evaluate the modifications of mps after treatments 2 3 hydrophilicity the contact angle is a standard parameter representing surface hydrophilicity niu et al 2021 due to the organic polymer nature almost all pristine mps have relative hydrophobic surfaces with contact angles larger than 70 lin et al 2020 van melkebeke et al 2020 after various treatments the aging and degradation induced surface oxidation and degradation resulting in variations of hydrophilicity oxidation induced by aops decreased the contact angle liu et al 2019b in our previous study the contact angle of ps was reduced from 120 to 10 after 120 mj cm2 vacuum ultraviolet vuv irradiation which was attributed to the hydroxyl radical oxidation on mps lin et al 2020 biological processes such as biofouling also reduced the surface hydrophobicity of mps van melkebeke et al 2020 in general the hydrophobic surfaces of pristine mps can be easily transferred to hydrophilic ones after various treatments 2 4 specific surface area brunauer emmett teller method was used to identify specific surface area ssa with a unit at m2 g generally as larger the mp size as smaller the ssa in addition the polymer type also affects the ssa godoy et al 2019 hueffer and hofmann 2016 xu et al 2019 for example the 5 mm pe particle has an ssa at 1 4 m2 g while the 250 μm one is 0 3 m2 g which is close to 5 mm pet one at 0 35 m2 g godoy et al 2019 hueffer and hofmann 2016 some existing studies have investigated the ssa variations of mps after aging and degradation fotopoulou et al 2012 found that uv aging pe and pp pellets presented higher ssa than the pristine ones which can be attributed to the eroded surface with rough and uneven morphology liu et al 2019b used k2s2o8 oxidation and fenton treatment to degrade mps as the mps size decreased an inverse tendency was observed for the ssa of ps and pe mps liu et al 2019b the modification of ssa can affect the interactions adsorption between mps and other contaminants further changing the behaviors of mps in the environment 3 modifications of mps in urban environmental management systems 3 1 drinking water treatment the centralized dwtps are applied in every modern city unfortunately it has been confirmed that mps penetrated a series of treatments into the final finished water of dwtps mintenig et al 2019 mortensen et al 2021 pivokonsky et al 2018 and they were directly transported to users therefore the modifications induced by various treatment methods in dwtps will increase the uncertainty of their risk to drinking water safety traditional drinking water treatment processes include coagulation precipitation filtration and disinfection the first three processes contributed to 60 99 removal of mps in source water hidayaturrahman and lee 2019 pivokonsky et al 2018 2020 wang et al 2020f they are all dominated by physical processes which negatively affect mps the effects induced by precipitation and filtration are negligible even coagulation only covers inorganic polymers and salts on the mp surfaces but not degradation xia et al 2020 zhang et al 2020c usually the disinfections in dwtps include chlorination uv and ozonation which are highly destructive for chlorination chlorine gas cl2 or sodium hypochlorite naclo is added to water and both ways generate hypochlorous acid hclo and hypochlorite clo these active components inactivate most of the bacteria and viruses in water for uv disinfection mercury lamps emitting 254 nm irradiation are applied this high energy uv penetrates cell walls and membranes to destroy dna and rna resulting in apoptosis and death of pathogens james and bolton 2008 for ozonation it induces oxidation of the pathogens resulting in the inactivation of even worms in water furthermore the organic contaminants in water can be degraded by ozone rapidly wang and wang 2020 generally the effects of disinfection on mps are highly dependent on dose a low dose concentration time ct value ct at 150 mg min l chlorination induced slight degradation kelkar et al 2019 on the contrary a high dose exposure ct at 25 g d l resulted in surface chemical degradation on pp hdpe and ps similarly hydroxylated modifications were observed on mps after high dose 254 nm uv treatment lin et al 2020 wang et al 2020e wu et al 2020 for ozonation its highly oxidative capacity induced decomposition on mps tian et al 2017 most of these studies focused on modifications of morphology and chemical structures on mps however the potential generation of disinfection by products from mps induced by these disinfection methods is still a mystery furthermore the modifications of mps in water supply networks under long term residual chlorine exposure are unknown besides disinfection to improve the treatment performance some pre treatments and advanced treatments are applied to dwtps chen et al 2022 hidayaturrahman and lee 2019 wang et al 2020f the pre treatments usually refer to pre oxidation and pre chlorination since the concentrations of mps in the source water are relatively high investigating the modifications of mps during pre treatments is significant but there is still no report on this topic the advanced treatments are usually set at the end of dwtps including various aops and membrane separation their effects on mps are discussed in section 4 3 2 wastewater treatment wwtps receive almost all the municipal wastewater and part of industrial wastewater from modern cities a series of primary secondary and tertiary treatments are applied in wwtps most wwtps contain only primary and secondary treatments and their targeted contaminants do not include mps nevertheless the overall removal rate of mps in these wwtps still reached 70 99 shen et al 2020 sun et al 2019 the primary treatments are mainly mechanical interception and physical precipitation such as bar screening air flotation and primary sedimentation removing large suspended particles from wastewater due to the small sizes mps are difficult to be intercepted by the bar screening in addition the low density of most mps can endow them with the capacity to float on the water surfaces resulting in low removal efficiency during sedimentation on the contrary air flotation may be an efficient method but its applications in wwtps are rarer than sedimentation the secondary treatment applies various biological methods mainly biofilm activated sludge processes followed by secondary sedimentation it was widely believed that these traditional treatments had limited effects on the degradation and aging of mps only transporting the mps from wastewater to sewage sludge he et al 2019 the majority of mps seem to be transferred into the sewage sludge but the remained mp residuals were still discharged along with the effluent to the received water bodies furthermore tertiary treatments including advanced oxidation membrane separation etc are applied in some wwtps chong et al 2010 lares et al 2018 lv et al 2019 ma et al 2019a unexpectedly a tertiary wwtp that applied membrane filtration still discharged mps to the effluent with removal rates in the range of 70 90 bayo et al 2020 ziajahromi et al 2017 many works have focused on the removal efficiencies of mps in wwtps table s1 akarsu et al 2020 alvim et al 2020 carr et al 2016 dris et al 2015 kittipongvises et al 2022 liu et al 2019c ren et al 2020 talvitie et al 2017b zhang et al 2021a all these studies indicated that the regular secondary treatments in wwtps cannot wholly remove mps resulting in many mps being released into the natural aquatic environment some studies have reported the characteristics variations of mps in different treatments such as the polymer type shape and color akarsu et al 2020 investigated the shape distribution of mps in three turkish wwtps the overall removal efficiencies of these three wwtps were in the range of 48 73 the mp sizes in the influent of these wwtps were similar with dominant polymers of pp and pe the main shapes were particle and fiber with the colors crystal transparent brown and black after treatments the mps in the effluent were still pp and pe fibers but the number of hard plastics had increased with the primary colors of crystal transparent orange or purple kelly et al 2021 evaluated the mps and associated biofilms within the influent effluent and sludge of two wwtps in dupage the overall removal rate of mps reached 99 the dominant mps in influent were fibers but the ones in effluent were particles the biological composition of mps was also different after treatments the abundance of some potentially pathogenic bacterial taxa e g campylobacteraceae decreased suggesting the modifications of microplastic associated assemblages tang et al 2020 compared the modifications of mps in two wwtps in wuhan china the dominant mps in the influents were pvc fibers and fragments with the colors of white black and transparent the overall removal rates of fibers and fragments were 66 and 63 respectively after a series of physical and chemical processes some modifications such as crushing and corrosion were observed on mps and their size decreased only a few cases have tracked the changes in morphology material and status of mps during wastewater treatments this may be due to the lack of tracking techniques of mps in wwtps resulting in the knowledge gap about the entire fate of specific mps the impact of wastewater treatments on mp is essential to predict their behavior and fate after entering the environment thus further research and data are still required 3 3 sewage sludge treatment in the primary treatment of wwtps inorganic particles with abundant large scale mps are settled by grit and primary sedimentation basins furthermore excess activated sludge is formed in biological treatment stages containing mps after these two treatment stages more than 75 of mps were removed and transferred into the sludge jiang et al 2020 long et al 2019 the concentration of mps in the sludge of 28 sewage treatment plants in china reached 22 7 12 1 103 particles per kilogram dry sludge li et al 2018b while pp and pe were the dominant mps zhang et al 2020b unlike the wastewater treatments sludge treatment processes could induce significant modifications to mps table s2 sludge treatments contain concentration conditioning stabilization and drying processes generally various destructions including abrasive stripping bubbling etc occurred on the mp surfaces after sludge treatments li et al 2018b firstly the concentration and conditioning processes aim to reduce the moisture content of the sludge by mechanical methods which only have limited effects on mps li et al 2018b on the contrary stabilization is highly destructive to mps it usually includes anaerobic and aerobic digestion aiming at converting sludge into sterile products the digestion in sludge treatment contributed to the reduction in the abundance and size of mps in the sludge zhang et al 2020a another research found that the anaerobic digestion of the kitchen waste caused aging and fragmentation of polylactic acid mps with irregular cracking and tiny daughter particles lu et al 2022 xu et al 2020 found that the predominant shape of mps in the effluent of a wwtp was microfiber while it was particles and fragments in its digested sludge this can be attributed to the biological degradation of microfibers into smaller parts during digestion in addition mahon et al 2017 found that the abundance of mps decreased after degradation of anaerobic digestion resulting in shredding and flaking of mps thermal drying is also a common used method for sludge treatment it was found that blisters and cracks appeared on mp surfaces after thermal drying mahon et al 2017 the abundance of mps significantly increased after thermal hydrolysis treatment li et al 2022 this might be due to high temperature and mechanical mixing leading to shear splitting of mps mahon et al 2017 on the contrary some studies reported different results li et al 2022 compared the effects of thermal drying and thermal hydrolysis on sludge mps and it seemed that thermal hydrolysis contributed to an increase in mps abundance but thermal drying had no influence another research also found that no significant difference of mp abundance occurred in sludge before and after thermal drying edo et al 2020 these different results can be attributed to the operating conditions and modes of sludge drying technology for example the temperature of sludge drying drum stirring speed stirring mode etc up to now only a few studies have been reported and more detailed and comprehensive research are required after sludge treatments mps size tended to be smaller with various deconstructions on their surface these mps are usually transferred to solid waste treatments such as composting and incineration the former one would transform sludge into biosolids which were used as a fertilizer and soil conditioner for agricultural usage koyuncuoglu and erden 2021 after incineration the sludge was burned into ash containing mps residual yang et al 2021b thus sewage sludge is also a vehicle for mps to enter the environment 3 4 solid waste treatments the surface morphology and environmental behaviors of mps may be further changed as sludge enters the solid waste treatment processes composting is a common solid waste treatment technique bernal et al 2009 wang et al 2018 which can effectively reduce or eliminate pathogens and organic pollutants in sludge chen et al 2020 mercier et al 2017 typically mps are enriched in excess sludge in wwtps subsequently they are transported to sludge treatment facilities some excess sludge is used for composting and eventually as agricultural fertilizer thus mps in sludge are transferred to the composting process which can alter their characteristics even changing their abundance fig 3 sun et al 2021b conducted a lab scale composting with 0 5 mps in the mixture of cow manure and sawdust for 60 days mps size and polymer types both had effects on the degradation performance they found that the abundance of small size mps 0 800 μm decreased significantly but pvc was difficult to be degraded furthermore the surfaces of all mps suffered evident erosions and cracks and the oxidized functional groups such as oh oc and o c increased their results indicated significant decompositions of mps after composting chen et al 2020 investigated a full scale composting facility and a 43 7 removal of mps was reported the mechanism in a lab scale experiment was explored and they found that hyperthermophilic bacteria played an important role evident pits and cavities were observed on the surface of composted mps which were eroded by these bacteria fig 3a d they concluded that the high temperature composting could be a potential method for mps reduction fig 3e and f watteau et al 2018 other studies pointed out that composting significantly impacted the size distribution of mps where larger mps were converted into smaller ones chen et al 2020 el hayany et al 2020 it was reported that composting increased the abundance of mps due to the release of small sized mps from the degraded macroplastics fig 3g j gui et al 2021 li et al 2022 the breakdown of mps might be induced by mechanical forces of the compost turning operation and chemical oxidation gui et al 2021 however ei hayany et al 2020 found that composting affected the size distribution and micro morphology of mps but not its abundance this might be because the microorganisms in their system had no capacity for mps degradation under the applied conditions conventional composting can change the mps abundance to some extent which is highly dependent on the compositing temperature and specific microbial community a global evaluation of more cases and samples is required to assess the modification of mps during composting since it cannot eliminate mps completely its product fertilizer may be a potential vehicle for mps into the environment the landfill is confirmed to store 21 42 of global plastic waste production nizzetto et al 2016 in landfills it is usually in an anaerobic environment and abundant macroplastics can be easily decomposed into mps mahon et al 2017 he et al 2019 proposed that the generation accumulation and release of mps from landfills was a long term process another research in norway reported leaking mps from landfills sundt et al 2014 su et al 2019 investigated mp abundance size and polymer composition variation patterns during a long term landfill more mps were detected in the young and medium landfills and their abundance decreased in the aged ones of note mps were detected in leachate from landfills narevski et al 2021 sun et al 2021a and the leachate treatment system contributed to the limited removal of mps zhang et al 2021b reported that a pretreatment biotreatment advanced treatment process removed only 50 of mps in leachate with complete elimination of small mps 0 5 mm incineration was considered a terminator of most solid waste including mps however the latest studies have confirmed that unburned materials in the bottom ash from incinerators still contained mps and the mps abundance in it reached 1 9 565 particles kg after incineration yang et al 2021b various polymer types and shapes of mps were found in the bottom ash this suggested that it could still be a vector of mps to the environment another research in china reported that tear marks protrusions and scratches were observed on the mp surface after incineration jian et al 2020 furthermore unexpected increments of heavy metals such as cu cd pb zn cr etc were found on the surface of mps in the bottom ash suggesting an increasing risk of these released mps shen et al 2021 4 mps removal and modification by novel methods since the existing traditional treatments cannot wholly remove mps from drinking water wastewater and solid waste it is desirable to develop novel methods to improve the removal efficiency of mps evaluation of some efforts has been made 4 1 membrane separation membrane separation is already applied in drinking water treatments and wastewater treatments theoretically even the largest pore size of microfiltration is smaller than 0 1 μm suggesting that they can eliminate micro level mps quickly ma et al 2019a whereas the practical membranes still contain pores much larger than their apparent pore size due to the manufacturing standards techniques and imperfections park et al 2017 thus some mps still penetrated the membrane into the effluent lv et al 2019 of note this unexpected phenomenon could happen for nano plastics which were smaller than the pore size of the membrane due to the limitation of detection techniques for nano plastics there is still no evidence for this hypothesis however it cannot be denied that membrane separation presented efficient and ideal performance on mps removal li et al 2018a talvitie et al 2017a membrane reactor mbr is widely applied in wastewater treatment talvitie et al 2017a found that mbr had the best performance removal 95 compared to rapid sand filter dissolved air flotation and disk filter another wwtp applied mbr technique contributed to a total removal efficiency of mps at 99 5 with 0 028 0 01 mg l mps in their effluent lv et al 2019 lares et al 2018 investigated a wwtp with a traditional activated sludge technique in finland and it contained a pilot mbr system only 0 5 particles l mps were detected in the effluent of the pilot mbr bayo et al 2020 used an mbr system to further treat a wwtp final effluent an eighty month monitoring was performed and better removal efficiency of particulate mps compared to microfibers was observed but without statistically significant differences between polymer types however some weaknesses such as membrane fouling and membrane deterioration cannot be ignored the latest study verified that mps aggravated these phenomena ma et al 2019a mps presented negative effects on sludge formation hydrophobicity and extracellular polymeric substance generation in mbr maliwan et al 2021 furthermore the potential release of mps from membrane modules is another thorny issue during actual operations such as membrane washing which may contribute to excessive mp pollution ding et al 2021 considering membrane techniques are typically used as the final process in dwtps and the tertiary treatment in wwtps the unexpected release of mps from membrane modules should be paid attention to further improvements in the removal efficiency through some specially designed approaches such as enzymatic membrane reactor assembled with some specific bacterium could make the membrane technique a promising method to fulfill the complete elimination of mps poerio et al 2019 yoshida et al 2016 4 2 tio2 photocatalysis tio2 photocatalysis is a type of environment friendly treatment technology based on the electronic transition reaction of photocatalysts cedillo gonzalez et al 2018 through the electronic transition a series of activated radicals such as hydroxyl radicals oh are generated and they degrade organic pollutants in multiple matrixes nakata and fujishima 2012 for organic polymers such as mps photocatalytic reactions have been proven effective camila ariza tarazona et al 2020 the degradation mechanism of mps by photocatalysis is mainly the oxidation of their organic skeleton induced by radicals tio2 is the most common photocatalyst in various applications and products nakata and fujishima 2012 paumo et al 2021 several attempts have been conducted to test the potential of tio2 photocatalysis for mps degradation nabi et al 2020 tested the degradation of 400 nm ps and pe microspheres using a tio2 nanoparticle film made by triton x 100 it demonstrated a relatively fast photocatalysis 98 removal within 12 h and the degradation mechanism was confirmed to be radical oxidation resulting in the production of hydroxyl carbonyl and carbon hydrogen groups luo et al 2021a synthesized a nano tio2 coated pp mps and they found that the photocatalysis occurred around the nano tio2 particles in mps which accelerated the softening and aging of pp mps wang et al 2019 proposed a novel strategy to eliminate mps using photocatalytic micromotors au mag tio2 mag ni fe and it presented an excellent collection and removal of mps in water in addition some other modified tio2 have been developed for the degradation of mps n tio2 compared with the pristine tio2 is more sustainable zeng et al 2015 camila ariza tarazona et al 2019 extracted hdpe mps from facial scrubs and used n tio2 based semiconductors to degrade these hdpe mps they found that the environmental conditions mps n tio2 interaction and the n tio2 surface area should be carefully adjusted to maintain the photocatalytic degradation rate a biologically inspired c n tio2 photocatalyst was developed in their further research they found that low temperature and low ph benefited the interaction between mps and tio2 camila ariza tarazona et al 2020 these studies suggested that applying tio2 photocatalysis required delicate controlling and monitoring of reaction conditions to ensure their efficiency generally the existing studies have shown the potential of photocatalytic degradation of mps the photocatalytic technology relies on indirect oxidation of mps by radicals and produces harmless byproducts however mps are solid organic polymers even if they have tiny sizes a relatively long photocatalytic time and a large amount of photocatalyst are indispensable to achieving their complete degradation and mineralization furthermore the low quantum yield of photocatalysts including tio2 is still a bottleneck for their applications the photocatalytic degradation of mps still requires further innovative research 4 3 other advanced oxidation processes aops besides photocatalysis some other aops including fenton oxidation ozonation and vuv have been tested for the degradation of mps fenton treatment accelerates the mps degradation with highly oxidative free radicals i e oh in the presence of fe2 h2o2 is transformed to oh and other oxidative species in water liu et al 2019b reported that significant alternations of surface morphology size distribution hydrophobicity and chemical feature occurred after fenton treatment they found that the surface alterations of pe were more intense than ps these alterations enhanced the adsorption capacity of mps liu et al 2019a mueller et al 2018 miao et al 2020 demonstrated that the electro fenton like technology based on tio2 c cathode successfully degraded pvc mps with a 56 wt removal the dominant mechanism was confirmed to be oh oxidation resulting in the breakage of pvc backbone of note fenton oxidation is now widely used as the pre treatment for mp extraction from field samples in which the degradation of mps should be considered carefully ozonation is a highly destructive method to degrade contaminants up to now some studies have tested its effectiveness on mps degradation tian et al 2017 have found that ozone induced several alterations in ps including the fragments and formation of carbonyl groups under 189 mg l ozonation tian et al 2017 in actual treatments this ozone concentration is exceptionally high pulido reyes et al 2020 studied the modifications of mps under the actual ozone concentration applied in water treatment lake water was used as the experiment matrix and no visible alteration in ps and polyacrylonitrile was observed the hydrodynamic diameter and aggregation state of mps remained steady under 0 5 5 mg l ozonation pulido reyes et al 2020 in a full scale advanced dwtp mps 1 5 μm from the ozonation effluent even increased by 2 8 16 0 resulting in a negative removal but a combination process of ozonation and granular activated carbon filtration has improved the removal efficiency of mps by 17 2 22 2 compared to traditional treatments wang et al 2020f additionally vuv which emits both 254 nm and 185 nm irradiation is a novel aop for water treatment the high energy 185 nm irradiation splits the h2o molecule to generate oh in water matrixes thus it also induced decomposition of mps mainly depending on the irradiation dose lin et al 2020 applied vuv irradiation to degrade four types of mps including ps pe pvc and pet and they found that significant alternations in morphology and chemical feature occurred on mp surface for example the surfaces of pvc mps showed some bubble structures after vuv treatment fig 5 c and d the modifications on mp surfaces weaken their adsorption of ciprofloxacin several combined aops techniques have also been developed for the elimination of mps for instance amelia et al 2021 reported that the combination of ozonation and h2o2 had a synergistic degradation effect on pe through radical based oxidation other combination methods such as the electro fenton like process miao et al 2020 and uv tio2 technique lee et al 2020 were tested to be available for the degradation of mps an existing review has covered the overview of some aops for removing mps ricardo et al 2021 generally the degradation mechanism of mps by these aops is the oxidation induced by free radicals since the generation efficiency of radicals is relatively low they may only be significant for nps and small size mps several micrometers degradation but not for large mps using aops for mps elimination is still far from actual application 5 effects of aging and degradation on the behaviors of mps 5 1 adsorption of heavy metals the influences on heavy metals adsorption induced by various treatments are summarized here most existing research focused on water treatments and only limited studies have reported sludge treatments the adsorption mechanism of heavy metals on mps included van der waals force electrostatic interaction and complexation ashton et al 2010 godoy et al 2019 holmes et al 2014 the modifications of mp characteristics such as surface chemical structure shape hydrophilicity and ssa can affect the interactions between mps and heavy metals the density and distribution of distinct functional groups especially oxygen containing structures on mps can be altered by physicochemical methods in water treatments affecting the sorption equilibria of heavy metals guo and wang 2021 town et al 2018 wang et al 2020d used uv a at 313 nm to degrade pet debris in water and the mp surfaces presented increasing ssa and oxidized functional groups as a result the adsorption of cu2 and zn2 was enhanced similar phenomena were observed for uv treated ps microspheres mao et al 2020 in another study fenton oxidation of ps mps was conducted their results showed that more adsorption sites were exposed on the surface promoting the adsorption of cd2 on ps mps lang et al 2020 furthermore polar functional groups such as ketones generated on aged mps were verified to facilitate the interaction with heavy metals wang et al 2017 generally after various treatments the characteristic chemical structures on mps may be changed affecting their adsorption of heavy metals the particle size was also considered a significant factor affecting the adsorption and some treatment processes in wwtps changed the mp size rochman et al 2015 mps can be broken into smaller fragments with the aged surface generating more adsorption sites and reactive surface areas promoting adsorption qiao et al 2019 reported that small size mps had higher adsorption capacities furthermore the alkaline hydrolysis used in the lime stabilization process sheared the granular mps resulting in an increased abundance of heavy metals on the surface bradney et al 2019 besides water treatments sludge treatments can also change the surface oxidation degree li et al 2019 collected sewage sludge samples from three wwtps they detected cd cu and co on the sludge based mps indicating that the sludge based mps accumulated metals during treatments similar to aged mps compared to pristine mps the adsorption potentials of the sludge based mps to heavy metals increased by approximately one order of magnitude this may be due to the functional groups generated on the mps having a higher affinity with heavy metal ions 5 2 adsorption of organic matter for organic contaminants van der waals force h bonds and electrostatic interaction dominate the chemical adsorption capacity it is also affected by the hydrophobicity ssa and surface electric charge status of mps the uv c disinfection at 254 nm decreased the hydrophobicity of ps pet and pvc and their adsorption of phenol declined lin et al 2020 similar results were reported by hueffer et al 2018 they found that the adsorption capacities of aged ps to twenty one organic probe sorbates were weakened by uv c irradiation furthermore wu et al 2020 found that uv aging negatively affected the adsorption of 2 2 4 4 tetrabromodiphenyl ether by ps mps which was also due to the declining hydrophobicity in general the decreasing hydrophobicity induced by surface oxidation contributed to the weakening adsorption of organic contaminants the octanol water partition coefficients logkow of organic contaminants had linear correlations with their adsorption on particular mps theoretically an organic contaminant with a higher logkow would adsorb on the hydrophobic mps more easily the modifications induced by various treatments would change the surface hydrophobicity of mps resulting in modifications to their adsorption capacities lan et al 2021 investigated the adsorption of four pesticides on pe films after field aging sunlight rain etc the adsorption capacity presented different variations which depended on pesticide types the authors concluded that this phenomenon was attributed to different logkow of pesticides which are influenced by the hydrophobic partitioning rather than by electrostatic forces or interactions another report contributed to consistent results liu et al 2020a on the contrary zhang et al 2018 collected natural aging mp debris from coastal beaches of north china compared to the pristine mps they found that the adsorption of oxytetracycline by aging mps was enhanced actual aging samples may suffer various degradation processes which is more elusive than the laboratory samples thus the actual effect on adsorption induced by various urban environmental management systems would involve complicated mechanisms some dimension reduction methods such as principle component analysis may be useful to identify the dominating factor affecting the adsorption capacities of mps after different treatments yet no study presents a relevant case so far 5 3 sinking capacity in an aqueous medium the sinking capacity of mps is crucial to their distribution the density size shape and roughness of mps affect the sinking velocity which may change during various treatments there is little direct evidence between the mp modifications and their sinking capacity several existing studies have provided some clues kaiser et al 2017 incubated ps and pe mps in river estuary and seashore for six weeks and they evaluated the sinking capacity of these mps it was found that the obtained biofouling increased the sinking velocities of ps by 16 in river water and 81 in marine water but it was not valid for pe they concluded that the biofouling attachments weakened the effect of density differences between particle and fluid over time resulting in the increasing sinking velocities in another study the mp shapes which are associated with the sphericity index were identified as the decisive factor kowalski et al 2016 the theoretical values of sinking velocity were calculated based on perfectly rounded spheres sphericity index 1 after the disruptive processes in various treatments mps tend to be irregular resulting in declining sinking velocities our previous studies investigated the sinking behaviors of mps after disinfection and permanganate pre oxidation chen et al 2022 lin et al 2022 it was found that uv and permanganate treatments enhanced the sinking behaviors of ps pet and pvc but not for pe furthermore the chlorination disinfection had a contrary effect indeed more proofs are still required to reveal the intrinsic mechanisms 5 4 contaminants release it is well known that the mps continuously release contaminants into the environments including the acquired contaminants and the inherent additives after aging and degradation this phenomenon is enhanced bandow et al 2017 used photooxidative and thermo oxidative treatments and the release of organic compounds and inorganic cl ca2 cu2 and zn2 from mps were all accelerated pigments are released under photooxidative aging for example the lead chromate pigmented mps released its monomer e g cr pb into the water increasing the potential risk of mps aging luo et al 2020a thermal decomposition and advanced oxidation of mps accelerated the release of pigments luo et al 2020c 2021b besides the tio2 added in some degradable plastics could be a potential derived contaminant from mps luo et al 2020b found that the release of tio2 particles from aged mps was faster than the pristine ones it can be inferred that the aging and degradation during treatment processes enhanced the release of contaminants from mps due to their accelerating degradation this increased the potential risk of mps up to now only limited information has been reported regarding this finding and further research is urgently needed 5 5 antibiotic resistance genes args recently args are emerging pollutants that have caused many adverse effects the horizontal gene transfer process is one of the important pathways for the emergence of antibiotic resistance genes qin et al 2020 the presence of mps aggravated the horizontal gene transfer of args wang et al 2020b found that mps enriched for args with different profiles electively might be sites for horizontal gene transfer another study reported that pvc mps adsorbed args and bacterial pathogens wu et al 2019 shen et al 2019 suggested that mps facilitated gene exchange among attached microbial communities leading to the spread of antibiotic resistant and causative genes yet the effects of treatment inducing modifications on the attachments of microorganisms and args remain scarce 6 conclusion and outlook summarizing the modifications of mps during different urban environmental management systems table s3 it was found that in dwtps disinfection methods induce evident degradation on mps for wwtps the sludge treatments showed decomposition on mps various solid waste treatments such as compost and anaerobic digestion induced a reduction of mps through biological degradation however regardless treatment method used mps were not completely eliminated but transferred from one matrix to another eventually released into the environment thus all these treatments are not only the vehicles but also the converters for mps before they enter the environment more attention should be paid to the modifications of mps during full scale disinfection in dwtps and the water supply network furthermore the effects of traditional biological treatments in wwtps on mps also require further study various treatments would change the characteristics of mps which affected their behaviors in the environment at present the adsorption sinking and contaminants release of mps have been confirmed to be affected by different treatments however the existing knowledge is still limited other behaviors such as migration fragmentation and additives leaching are still unknown significant efforts are still required to reveal the behavior and risk modifications of mps after various urban environmental management systems up to now there is still a lack of efficient methods for mps elimination considering the direct ingestion of mps through drinking water it is desirable to develop practicable methods for mps removal in dwtps membrane separation may be a terminal interception of mps furthermore mps are finally enriched in sludge and solid waste thus some novel techniques aiming at the targeted removal of mps from these matrixes are essential to reduce their environmental impact declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

15641,catalytic membrane can achieve sieving separation and advanced oxidation simultaneously which can improve the effluent water quality while reducing membrane fouling in this study the catalytic membranes m2 al am were fabricated by loading different binary layered metal oxides m2 al lmo mnal lmo cual lmo and coal lmo on alumina ceramic substrate membranes am via vacuum filtration followed by calcination process the performance of the catalytic membranes was investigated by filtering actual surface water it was found that the presence of peroxymonosulfate pms could mitigate membrane fouling effectively as evidenced by the increase of normalized flux from 0 28 to 0 62 in coal am pms system from 0 25 to 0 52 in cual am pms system and from 0 22 to 0 31 in mnal am pms system respectively correspondingly the coal am exhibited the highest removal for uv254 toc and fluorescent components in the surface water followed by cual am and mnal am quenching effect of phenol and furfuryl alcohol proposed the surface bound radicals and singlet oxygen were the major reactive oxygen species in the m2 al am pms systems interface free energy calculations confirmed the in situ pms activation could enhance the repulsive interactions between nom and the membranes thus mitigating membrane fouling this work provides an original but simple strategy for catalytic ceramic membrane preparation and new insights into the mechanism of membrane fouling mitigation in catalytic membrane system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ceramic catalytic membrane binary layered metal oxides peroxymonosulfate activation membrane fouling mitigation surface water treatment data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction in the past decades membrane technology has been extensively used for the treatment of drinking water and reclamation of wastewater treatment plant wwtp secondary effluent a cassano 2015 van geluwe et al 2011 wang et al 2016 compared to polymer membranes the ceramic membranes have excellent thermal chemical and mechanical stability as well as significantly prolonged service time lee et al 2013 among them the hollow fiber ceramic membrane possesses the advantages of large effective filtration area per unit volume and high component flexibility in comparison with the traditional multi channel tube or plate membrane as a result intensive researches have been focused on the development of hollow fiber ceramic membranes in recent years abdullah et al 2016 chen et al 2018 wang et al 2019c however although it is believed the ceramic membrane is less fouled compared with polymer membrane severe membrane fouling is still observed when employed in drinking water or wwtp secondary effluent treatment bai et al 2021 hofs et al 2011 the membrane fouling caused by natural organic matter nom is still a key barrier to the wide application of ceramic membranes advanced oxidation processes aops has been widely employed in water treatment because it can produce highly reactive species which are capable of oxidizing the organic compounds into smaller and less hazardous substances chan et al 2011 duan et al 2018 compared with the traditional oh based aops so4 based aops sr aops exhibit the advantages of high redox potential high selectivity long half life and wide ph use range sun et al 2015 both peroxymonosulfate pms and persulfate ps have been ultilized in the sr aops while pms is more easily activated when compared with ps due to its asymmetric structure wang and wang 2018 therefore it has been widely used in removing organic pollutants and microorganisms in different water treatment processes wang et al 2019b however the main issue faced by sr aops is the recycling and reuse of catalysts wu et al 2019 immobilizing powdered catalysts on membrane surface and constructing catalytic membrane can realize the the sustainable utilization of the catalysts till now different catalytic membrane systems have been well developed such as photo and electro catalytic systems the catalytic membrane processes have shown to be promising in water treatment as the membrane separation and catalytic oxidation functions can be simultaneously achieved in a single filtration process kumari et al 2020 kumari et al 2021 however both photo or electro catalytic membrane systems depend on the input of outer energy and a sophisticate reactor design is required in comparison pms can be efficiently activated by various metal oxides the combination of pms activation with ceramic membrane may simplify the catalytic membrane process significantly under this background the preparation and application of metal oxide immobilized ceramic membranes with pms activation ability have attracted much attention in recent years for example wang et al wang et al 2021 proposed an integrated process for enhanced bisphenol a removal using copper oxide modified ceramic hollow fiber membrane with in situ pms activation bao et al 2018 proved that the sulfamethoxazole could be effectively degraded by cobalt ferrite dipping ceramic membrane through the activation of pms these researches demonstrated the catalytic membrane can achieve highly efficient trace organic pollutants removal possible due to the confinement effect in the membrane pore wang et al 2019a however the effect of in situ pms activation on the control of ceramic membrane fouling by nom is barely investigated even though the catalysts uniformly dispersed on the membrane may also improve the anti fouling ability via the oxidative degradation of nom by the reactive species generated on membrane surface wang et al 2020 compared to the traditional metal oxides as mentioned above layered metal oxide lmo is an emerging material with the advantages of interlayer ion interchangeability memory effects thermal stability and tunable chemical component shao et al 2013 sun et al 2013 the lmo can be easily obtained by calcinating the layered double hydroxide ldh which is a cheap and functional material for various of catalysts catalyst supports and precursors xie et al 2021 it is noted that the lmo possesses even more active sites and higher surface area than its ldh counterpart bai et al 2022 therefore it would be of great interest to develop lmo coated ceramic membrane to improve the organic pollutants removal and anti fouling ability simultaneously in this study the catalytic membranes m2 al am were prepared by loading the binary layered metal oxides m2 al lmo onto an alumina hollow fiber ceramic membrane am as the performance of organic pollutants removal by the catalytic membranes has been well documented wang et al 2020 wu et al 2019 this work was focused on the mitigation of membrane fouling by nom actual surface water was employed to investigate the membrane fouling behavior of the catalytic membranes with in situ pms activation furthermore the catalytic mechanism was systematically explored through quenching experiments and interface free energy calculations the role of the catalyst loading layer in nom degradation and membrane fouling mitigation was also clarified the results of this work may provide theoretical basis and technical support for preparation and application of the novel catalytic membranes 2 experimental section 2 1 materials and

filtration the vacuum pressure was 1 bar the loaded membranes were dried in an 80 c oven for 6 hours the dried membranes were then calcined at 500 550 c in the mafer furnace and the ceramic hollow fiber catalytic membranes with different loading dosage were obtained which were denoted as m2 al10 am m2 al30 am and m2 al50 am respectively where the number represented the mass of the m2 al ldh in loading solution 2 3 experimental setup to investigate the catalytic oxidation and filtration properties of m2 al am the batch experiments was carried out with a cross flow filtration setup fig s2

water permeability was measured to determine the inherent resistance rm of the membrane then the actual water was filtered for 30 min to determine the total fouling resistance rt thereafter the fouled membrane was washed with high concentration pms 3 0 mm for 15 min and the fouling that could be removed by the pms was defined as reversible fouling rr while that could not be removed was defined as irreversible fouling rir the specific calculation formulas are shown in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the m2 al am the sem images and eds mappings of different m2 al lmo loaded ceramic membranes were showed in fig 1 compared with virgin am fig 1 a1 the surface of catalytic membranes were uniformly dispersed with mnal lmo cual lmo and coal lmo respectively fig 1 b1 d1 which can be further confirmed by the cross sectional sem and eds mapping fig 1 a3 d3 a4 d4 the results proved that mnal lmo cual lmo and coal lmo were successfully loaded on am surface by the method of vacuum filtration and calcination process fig 1 a2 d2 showed the microstructure of the loading layer at a larger magnification which exhibited the average pore size of 579 177 253 and 211 nm of am mnal am cual am and coal am respectively pure water immersion experiments demonstrated that the loading layer could remain stable even after immersion for 270 days and the leaching concentration of cu mn and co ion was only 0 033 0 319 and 0 221 mg l respectively fig s3 the loading layer thickness of the catalytic membranes with different m2 al lmos were shown in fig 2 a the thickness of catalyst layer increased proportionally with the increase of m2 al lmos loaded on the membranes among which the catalyst layer thickness of mnal am was the lowest at the same loading dosage which might be due to its small average particle size bai et al 2022 different thickness of the loading layer could cause differences in the corresponding membrane water flux fig 2 b for the same type of membranes the thicker the loading layer the smaller the membrane flux would be in terms of different membrane type the cual am flux was the highest while that of mnal am was the lowest in the following experiments according to the removal performance of nom fluorescent components under different pms dosage by the catalytic membranes with different dosage of catalysts fig s4 the m2 al30 am was employed for investigating the catalytic filtration performance and mechanisms of the ceramic membranes under the pms dosage of 1 0 mm 3 2 the catalytic filtration performance of m2 al am pms systems 3 2 1 flux decaying and fouling resistance analysis in different systems to explore the effect of different membrane systems on membrane fouling we investigated the 3 cycle membrane flux decaying and the corresponding membrane fouling resistance caused by nom in actual water without or with pms addition as seen from fig 3 a when without pms addition there was not much difference in flux decaying among origin am mnal am cual am and coal am which might be a result of the combined effect of membrane pore size and hydrophilicity when pms was added in the systems the normalized flux of m2 al am was improved to different extent which were ordered as coal am cual am mnal am am fig 3 b after 3 cycle of filtration the final j j0 were 0 58 0 45 0 26 and 0 18 for the different catalytic membranes respectively which was in distinct comparison with the 0 21 0 20 0 16 and 0 15 for the situation without pms addition the improved anti fouling performance might be due to that the m2 al lmo loaded on am could activate pms to generate reactive oxygen species ros while the ros would degrade nom molecules accumulating on the membrane thus slowing down the decay of membrane normalized flux the mitigating extent of membrane fouling is determined by the catalytic activity of m2 al lmos and the coal am exhibited the lowest normalized flux decline among the catalytic membranes which probably due to the highest content of ros produced in coal am pms system as discussed in detail in section 3 4 the fouling resistance distribution of the different membrane systems were shown in fig 3 c in the systems without pms addition the irreversible fouling resistance of these four membranes were ordered as am mnal am cual am coal am when pms was added in the filtration system the reversible fouling was remarkably reduced for all the membranes however the irreversible fouling resistance of mnal am and cual am were shown to be even higher than the case without pms this might be attributed to the fact that though mnal am and cual am could activate pms to generate ros for the degradation of nom but their overall oxidation capacity were limited and the produced medium molecules could block the membrane pores thus exacerbating the irreversible membrane fouling it was also seen from fig 3 c that the coal am exhibited the highest hydraulic cleaning efficiency in comparison with other membranes for both cases of without and with pms addition 3 2 2 removals of uv254 and toc fig 4 shows the removal of uv254 and toc in am and m2 al am systems with or without pms addition during treating surface water as shown in fig 4 a these membranes rejected uv254 by about 10 20 without the addition of pms when pms was introduced the removal rate of am was only slightly improved by contrast the uv254 removal was strengthened significantly in the m2 al am pms systems which reached to 39 29 41 94 and 65 43 for mnal am cual am coal am respectively as mentioned earlier m2 al lmo loaded on membrane surface can activate pms to generate ros and oxidize high molecular weight mw nom into small mw substances or even mineralize them therefore there may be an increase or decrease of toc concentration in the permeate after pms addition while the specific situation is determined by the ability of lmo to activate pms as can be seen from fig 4 a the toc removal by am mnal am and cual am systems were all shown to be decreased to some extent which could be due to that a portion of nom macromolecules were degraded into small mw organic substances and the later passed through the membrane pores more easily and thus increasing the permeate toc content while for the coal am system it was observed that the toc removal was significantly enhanced after pms addition which might be due to the higher mineralization of nom during pms based advanced oxidation leading to the efficient reduction of toc content fig 4 b showed the molecular weight distribution of nom in raw water and treated water by different m2 al am pms systems the organic molecular weight in the raw water was mostly concentrated at around 10000 da in the presence of pms the molecular weight distribution was significantly decreased after treatment by the catalytic membranes among which the lowest mw peak was observed for coal am this result was in good agreement with the trend of toc removal 3 2 3 fluorescent organic matter eem was used to characterize the variation of fluorescent substances in the water during treatment by different catalytic membranes from fig s5 it can be seen that the raw water mainly contain humic and proteins which have been recognized as major membrane foulants and both of them can cause the decline of membrane flux by parallel factor analysis three fluorescent components were identified and labeled as component 1 c1 component 2 c2 and component 3 c3 as can be seen in the eem contour plots fig 5 a c c1 appears at the ex wavelength of 220 240 nm 300 330 nm and em wavelength of 390 430 nm which belongs to the microbial derived humic like substances c2 ex em 250 280 nm 370 nm 450 500 nm is attributed to terrestrial derived humic like substances and c3 ex em 235 nm 290nm 330 350 nm is related to tryptophan like proteins tian et al 2018 fig 5 d f showed the variations in the removal of fluorescence components during filtration by am and different m2 al am with the addition of pms it was clear that no matter which fluorescent component was concerned the highest degradation removal nearly 100 was witnessed by the coal am pms system followed by the cual am pms mnal am pms and am pms systems the pms concentration in the membrane permeate was shown in fig s6 as can be seen the coal am system exhibited the greatest consumption of pms 90 followed by cual am and mnal am which were consistent with the fluorescent substance degradation this result confirmed once again that the coal lmo loaded on membrane surface can activate pms and produce ros efficiently thus favoring the degradation of membrane foulants and leading to effective mitigation of membrane fouling from fig s7 it was observed that the leaching of co ions were always below 0 6 mg l throughout the filtration which were even lower than the cu leaching from cual am at the latter part of filtration process suggesting the excellent stability of coal am 3 3 characterization of fouled membranes the membrane surface morphology after fouling and cleaning were shown in fig 6 ⅰ the membrane surface were obviously accumulated with nom after fouling and the membrane pores were blocked in large areas after cleaning the membrane surface foulants were significantly removed and some membrane pores were re exposed the degree of membrane fouling could also be indicated by the membrane surface roughness rms as can be seen from the afm images fig s8 the membrane surface rms value decreased after fouling and the rms value decreased more significantly as the fouling increased the rms values were shown to be increased after cleaning the full spectrum of xps for the different elements on membrane surface are shown in fig s9 it can be found that the fouled membrane surface mainly contains the elements of c o and n where c and o elements have a large relative strength as can be seen in fig 6 ⅱ four obvious chemical binding signals appeared at 285 6 ev 284 2 ev 287 0 ev and 287 9 ev which represented aliphatic carbon c c aromatic carbon c c carboxylic carbon o c o and ketonic carbon c o respectively lin et al 2014 all the four functional groups appeared on fresh membrane surface among which the c c was the major component might be due to the carbonization of the dispersant peg during calcination process for the fouled membranes the relative content of c o and o c o functional groups on membrane surface increased while the c c and c c components were reduced which might be due to the nom adhering to the membrane the relative content of c o and o c o functional groups decreased again after cleaning since the humus and proteins are enriched in c o and o c o functional groups it could be speculated that the main nom fractions causing membrane fouling were humic and protein like substances this result was also consistent with the fluorescent component analysis in section 3 2 3 specifically the relative increase of c o and o c o on membrane surface after fouling followed the order am coal am cual am mnal am indicating that more nom deposited on the mnal am surface it was worth noting that less change of functional groups was observed on the surface of am even though the most severe membrane flux decay was observed for am the reason might be that the xps preferred to analyze the elements on membrane surface while for am organic foulants might accumulate in the sub surface due to the large membrane pores and as a result xps could not make an accurate analysis for the membrane foulants on am 3 4 the possible catalytic mechanism in order to explore the catalytic mechanism of the catalytic reaction we explored from the following three aspects the probe organic compound removal the effect of ros quenchers on membrane flux and the interface free energy between the membrane and the foulant 3 4 1 removal of probe organic compound nom contains a complex organic matrix with different mw and functional groups to explore the catalytic mechanism of the m2 al am pms systems during filtration of actual surface water we first chose bpa a well investigated organic pollutant in the literature chen et al 2019 lin et al 2020 as the probe organic compound to determine the ros in the catalytic system the actual water spiked with 10 mg l of bpa was employed as the feed water the bpa concentration in the permeate during membrane filtration with different ros quenchers is shown in fig 7 in the absence of pms the membranes only exhibited a negligible removal of bpa by adsorption and or rejection which was excluded to consideration in the subsequent analysis in the presence of pms 74 03 63 46 and 100 of bpa removal were achieved within 30 min by the mnal am pms cual am pms and coal am pms systems respectively meoh and tba the common inhibitors of hydroxyl and sulfate radicals hu et al 2017 had essentially no effect on bpa degradation when added to the m2 al am pms systems so it can be speculated that no free radicals were produced in the systems when phenol a well documented surface bound radical inhibitor liang et al 2013 was added to the system the degradation of the bpa was significantly inhibited and the inhibition effect gradually increased with the increase of phenol content indicating the presence of surface bound free radicals in the catalytic system to explore the presence of non free radical ros in the system ffa as a common singlet oxygen inhibitor was added in the filtration systems bai et al 2022 the results showed that the addition of ffa could also inhibit bpa degradation to a significant extent and the inhibition increased with the increasing content of ffa demonstrating that the singlet oxygen was also present in the systems the above results displayed that the m2 al am pms was a complex catalytic system with both surface bound radical and singlet oxygen as major ros 3 4 2 effect of ros quenchers on membrane flux the addition of quenchers can suppress the generation of reactive oxygen species and inhibit the degradation of membrane foulants manifested by an accelerated decrease in membrane flux the membrane normalized flux under the addition of different quenchers is shown in fig 8 compared to the m2 al am pms systems without quenchers the addition of meoh and tba had little effect on membrane flux in mnal am pms and cual am pms systems while for the coal am pms system a slightly aggravated membrane fouling was observed upon the addition of meoh and tba implying that free sulfate and hydroxyl radicals may exist in the coal am pms system this result was not consistent with that observed when using bpa as probe organic compound when phoh was added to the system more severe membrane flux decaying was witnessed in all m2 al am pms systems indicating that surface bound radicals existed in the systems the ffa had no effect on the membrane flux in the mnal am pms system but exacerbated membrane fouling in the cual am pms and coal am pms systems suggesting singlet oxygen also contributed to the mitigation of membrane fouling in cual am pms and coal am pms systems notably the effect of ros quenchers on membrane flux decline did not exactly match that judged by bpa degradation we speculated that it might be due to the interaction of quenchers with the membranes affecting the membrane fouling behavior however the exact reason still requires further study to clarify 3 4 3 interface free energy between the membrane and foulant the interface interaction between the membrane and foulants under different conditions was further investigated to clarify the mechanism for membrane fouling mitigation according to the contact angles measured by using three probe liquids tables s3 s5 we can obtain the surface tension parameters for the membranes and membrane foulants γ γ γlw γab and γtot through eqs 4 6 table 2 and 3 thereafter the interface free energies δgflm lw δgflm ab and δgflm tot between the membranes and foulants were calculated through eqs 1 3 and shown in fig 9 as can be seen all the δgflm lw was negative which indicated the attractive lw interactions between the membrane and the foulants in contrast the δgflm ab was all positive indicating a repulsive ab interactions between the membrane and foulants in fig 9 a the change trend of δgflm ab was similar to that of δgflm tot due to that the absolute value of δgflm ab was much higher than that of δgflm lw indicating the dominant role of ab free energy in the total interaction energy zhao et al 2020 before filtration the δgflm tot between the membranes and nom in raw surface water r0 were ordered as coal am am cual am mnal am while after catalytic filtration the δgflm tot value became greater than the corresponding values before filtration indicating that addition of pms can increase the interface free energy between the foulants and membranes thus mitigating the membrane fouling notably the mitigation of membrane fouling did not necessarily imply an increase in toc removal rate in the permeate the change of toc values in the permeate mainly depended on the ability of the catalyst to activate pms as analyzed in section 3 2 2 fig 4 a to explore the effect of ros quenchers on the interaction between the foulants and membrane we took the coal am pms system as an example to investigate the interface free energies in the presence of meoh tba phoh and ffa respectively as can be seen from fig 9 b the δgflm tot decreased after the addition of quenchers in the system indicating that the existence of quenchers decreased the repulsion between the foulant and membrane which made the membrane more easily to be fouled the addition of meoh and tba caused a slight decrease in the δgflm tot indicating a small amount of free sulfate and hydroxyl radicals might existed in the coal am pms system and played a minor role in the degradation of nom which was in accordance with the membrane flux decline behavior in fig 8 c it was noteworthy the addition of phoh decreased the δgflm tot value significantly from strongly positive to slightly negative which contributed to a much more severe membrane flux decaying as shown in fig 8 c further confirming the important role played by surface bound radicals in the coal am pms system the δgflm tot also exhibited a little decrease after ffa addition indicating that the presence of ffa had inhibited the oxidative degradation of nom to some extent and slightly weakened the repulsion between the membrane and foulants moreover it was noticed that there was some correlation between the δgflm tot and permeate toc value for the systems added with different quenchers fig s10 the permeate toc was shown to be decreased with the decrease of δgflm tot which could be attributed to the addition of quenchers inhibited the nom oxidation by ros generated by the catalytic membrane according to the results obtained in the experiments the mechanism for nom catalytic oxidation and membrane fouling mitigation in the m2 al am pms system was proposed as schematically illustrated in fig 10 when the feed water containing both nom and pms passed through the catalytic layer of the membrane the pms had a contact reaction with m2 al lmo on the outer surface of the catalysts and thus produce large amounts of surface bound radicals and singlet oxygen as the major ros which was accompanied by the change of the valence state of the metal elements eqs 7 9 fig s11 the nom in the feed water would be rapidly degraded after contacting with these ros with the decrease of nom molecular weight and removal of uv254 fluorescent components eq 10 as a result the interface adhesion free energy between the catalytic membane and nom foulants would be enhanced thus leading to the effective alleviation of nom fouling potential on the membrane in addition due to the efficient in situ oxidation the water quality of permeate water from the catalytic ceramic membrane would also be improved 7 m n 1 h s o 5 m n s o 5 h 8 m n h s o 5 m n 1 s o 4 o h o h s o 4 2 9 2 s o 5 h 2 o 1 5 1 o 2 2 h s o 4 10 s o 4 o h 1 o 2 n o m s m a l l m o l e c u l e s i n t e r m e d i a t e s c o 2 h 2 o 4 conclusions in this work lmo loaded alumina ceramic hollow fiber membranes were prepared and the effect of in situ activating pms on membrane fouling mitigation was investigated the following conclusions could be drawn 1 the m2 al am catalytic membranes exhibited different propensity to membrane fouling by nom in surface water in the presence of pms among which coal am showed the lowest flux decline and highest removal of uv254 and toc 2 three fluorescent organic components were identified in the surface water by parafac analysis with the addition of pms the fluorescent component removal by different membranes followed the order coal am cual am mnal am am 3 the surface bound radicals and singlet oxygen were confirmed to be the major ros in m2 al am pms systems the addition of pms could increase the interface free energy between the foulants and membranes thus enhancing the repulsion effect and mitigating membrane fouling declaration of competing interest the authors

15641,catalytic membrane can achieve sieving separation and advanced oxidation simultaneously which can improve the effluent water quality while reducing membrane fouling in this study the catalytic membranes m2 al am were fabricated by loading different binary layered metal oxides m2 al lmo mnal lmo cual lmo and coal lmo on alumina ceramic substrate membranes am via vacuum filtration followed by calcination process the performance of the catalytic membranes was investigated by filtering actual surface water it was found that the presence of peroxymonosulfate pms could mitigate membrane fouling effectively as evidenced by the increase of normalized flux from 0 28 to 0 62 in coal am pms system from 0 25 to 0 52 in cual am pms system and from 0 22 to 0 31 in mnal am pms system respectively correspondingly the coal am exhibited the highest removal for uv254 toc and fluorescent components in the surface water followed by cual am and mnal am quenching effect of phenol and furfuryl alcohol proposed the surface bound radicals and singlet oxygen were the major reactive oxygen species in the m2 al am pms systems interface free energy calculations confirmed the in situ pms activation could enhance the repulsive interactions between nom and the membranes thus mitigating membrane fouling this work provides an original but simple strategy for catalytic ceramic membrane preparation and new insights into the mechanism of membrane fouling mitigation in catalytic membrane system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ceramic catalytic membrane binary layered metal oxides peroxymonosulfate activation membrane fouling mitigation surface water treatment data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction in the past decades membrane technology has been extensively used for the treatment of drinking water and reclamation of wastewater treatment plant wwtp secondary effluent a cassano 2015 van geluwe et al 2011 wang et al 2016 compared to polymer membranes the ceramic membranes have excellent thermal chemical and mechanical stability as well as significantly prolonged service time lee et al 2013 among them the hollow fiber ceramic membrane possesses the advantages of large effective filtration area per unit volume and high component flexibility in comparison with the traditional multi channel tube or plate membrane as a result intensive researches have been focused on the development of hollow fiber ceramic membranes in recent years abdullah et al 2016 chen et al 2018 wang et al 2019c however although it is believed the ceramic membrane is less fouled compared with polymer membrane severe membrane fouling is still observed when employed in drinking water or wwtp secondary effluent treatment bai et al 2021 hofs et al 2011 the membrane fouling caused by natural organic matter nom is still a key barrier to the wide application of ceramic membranes advanced oxidation processes aops has been widely employed in water treatment because it can produce highly reactive species which are capable of oxidizing the organic compounds into smaller and less hazardous substances chan et al 2011 duan et al 2018 compared with the traditional oh based aops so4 based aops sr aops exhibit the advantages of high redox potential high selectivity long half life and wide ph use range sun et al 2015 both peroxymonosulfate pms and persulfate ps have been ultilized in the sr aops while pms is more easily activated when compared with ps due to its asymmetric structure wang and wang 2018 therefore it has been widely used in removing organic pollutants and microorganisms in different water treatment processes wang et al 2019b however the main issue faced by sr aops is the recycling and reuse of catalysts wu et al 2019 immobilizing powdered catalysts on membrane surface and constructing catalytic membrane can realize the the sustainable utilization of the catalysts till now different catalytic membrane systems have been well developed such as photo and electro catalytic systems the catalytic membrane processes have shown to be promising in water treatment as the membrane separation and catalytic oxidation functions can be simultaneously achieved in a single filtration process kumari et al 2020 kumari et al 2021 however both photo or electro catalytic membrane systems depend on the input of outer energy and a sophisticate reactor design is required in comparison pms can be efficiently activated by various metal oxides the combination of pms activation with ceramic membrane may simplify the catalytic membrane process significantly under this background the preparation and application of metal oxide immobilized ceramic membranes with pms activation ability have attracted much attention in recent years for example wang et al wang et al 2021 proposed an integrated process for enhanced bisphenol a removal using copper oxide modified ceramic hollow fiber membrane with in situ pms activation bao et al 2018 proved that the sulfamethoxazole could be effectively degraded by cobalt ferrite dipping ceramic membrane through the activation of pms these researches demonstrated the catalytic membrane can achieve highly efficient trace organic pollutants removal possible due to the confinement effect in the membrane pore wang et al 2019a however the effect of in situ pms activation on the control of ceramic membrane fouling by nom is barely investigated even though the catalysts uniformly dispersed on the membrane may also improve the anti fouling ability via the oxidative degradation of nom by the reactive species generated on membrane surface wang et al 2020 compared to the traditional metal oxides as mentioned above layered metal oxide lmo is an emerging material with the advantages of interlayer ion interchangeability memory effects thermal stability and tunable chemical component shao et al 2013 sun et al 2013 the lmo can be easily obtained by calcinating the layered double hydroxide ldh which is a cheap and functional material for various of catalysts catalyst supports and precursors xie et al 2021 it is noted that the lmo possesses even more active sites and higher surface area than its ldh counterpart bai et al 2022 therefore it would be of great interest to develop lmo coated ceramic membrane to improve the organic pollutants removal and anti fouling ability simultaneously in this study the catalytic membranes m2 al am were prepared by loading the binary layered metal oxides m2 al lmo onto an alumina hollow fiber ceramic membrane am as the performance of organic pollutants removal by the catalytic membranes has been well documented wang et al 2020 wu et al 2019 this work was focused on the mitigation of membrane fouling by nom actual surface water was employed to investigate the membrane fouling behavior of the catalytic membranes with in situ pms activation furthermore the catalytic mechanism was systematically explored through quenching experiments and interface free energy calculations the role of the catalyst loading layer in nom degradation and membrane fouling mitigation was also clarified the results of this work may provide theoretical basis and technical support for preparation and application of the novel catalytic membranes 2 experimental section 2 1 materials and

filtration the vacuum pressure was 1 bar the loaded membranes were dried in an 80 c oven for 6 hours the dried membranes were then calcined at 500 550 c in the mafer furnace and the ceramic hollow fiber catalytic membranes with different loading dosage were obtained which were denoted as m2 al10 am m2 al30 am and m2 al50 am respectively where the number represented the mass of the m2 al ldh in loading solution 2 3 experimental setup to investigate the catalytic oxidation and filtration properties of m2 al am the batch experiments was carried out with a cross flow filtration setup fig s2 keeping the pressure constant for 25 kpa two membrane fibers with the length of 11 cm formed the membrane module the feed water was taken from beiyun river in tianjin china before the experiments the water samples were pre filtered with a 0 45 μm membrane to remove particulate substances and placed in a beaker 500 ml the detailed water quality parameters can be found in table s1 a certain amount of pms was added to the feed water to start the catalytic reaction and the feed water was stirred magnetically during the reaction permeate water was collected by another beaker on an electronic

quantified according to the extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theory bai et al 2021 chen et al 2012 the total interfacial free energy δgtot consists of three components i e van der waals energy component δglw polar acid base ab energy component δgab and electrostatic double layer energy component δgel it has been proved that the δgel value is small brant and childress 2002 wu et al

6 membrane fouling resistance analysis membrane fouling behaviors were analyzed using the membrane fouling resistance model bai et al 2021 that is at the beginning of the filtration experiment pure water permeability was measured to determine the inherent resistance rm of the membrane then the actual water was filtered for 30 min to determine the total fouling resistance rt thereafter the fouled membrane was washed with high concentration pms 3 0 mm for 15 min and the fouling that could be removed by the pms was defined as reversible fouling rr while that could not be removed was defined as irreversible fouling rir the specific calculation formulas are shown in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the m2 al am the sem images and eds mappings of different m2 al lmo loaded ceramic membranes were showed in fig 1 compared with virgin am fig 1 a1 the surface of catalytic membranes were uniformly dispersed with mnal lmo cual lmo and coal lmo respectively fig 1 b1 d1 which can be further confirmed by the cross sectional sem and eds mapping fig 1 a3 d3 a4 d4 the results proved that mnal lmo cual lmo and coal lmo were successfully loaded on am surface by the method of vacuum filtration and calcination process fig 1 a2 d2 showed the microstructure of the loading layer at a larger magnification which exhibited the average pore size of 579 177 253 and 211 nm of am mnal am cual am and coal am respectively pure water immersion experiments demonstrated that the loading layer could remain stable even after immersion for 270 days and the leaching concentration of cu mn and co ion was only 0 033 0 319 and 0 221 mg l respectively fig s3 the loading layer thickness of the catalytic membranes with different m2 al lmos were shown in fig 2 a the thickness of catalyst layer increased proportionally with the increase of m2 al lmos loaded on the membranes among which the catalyst layer thickness of mnal am was the lowest at the same loading dosage which might be due to its small average particle size bai et al 2022 different thickness of the loading layer could cause differences in the corresponding membrane water flux fig 2 b for the same type of membranes the thicker the loading layer the smaller the membrane flux would be in terms of different membrane type the cual am flux was the highest while that of mnal am was the lowest in the following experiments according to the removal performance of nom fluorescent components under different pms dosage by the catalytic membranes with different dosage of catalysts fig s4 the m2 al30 am was employed for investigating the catalytic filtration performance and mechanisms of the ceramic membranes under the pms dosage of 1 0 mm 3 2 the catalytic filtration performance of m2 al am pms systems 3 2 1 flux decaying and fouling resistance analysis in different systems to explore the effect of different membrane systems on membrane fouling we investigated the 3 cycle membrane flux decaying and the corresponding membrane fouling resistance caused by nom in actual water without or with pms addition as seen from fig 3 a when without pms addition there was not much difference in flux decaying among origin am mnal am cual am and coal am which might be a result of the combined effect of membrane pore size and hydrophilicity when pms was added in the systems the normalized flux of m2 al am was improved to different extent which were ordered as coal am cual am mnal am am fig 3 b after 3 cycle of filtration the final j j0 were 0 58 0 45 0 26 and 0 18 for the different catalytic membranes respectively which was in distinct comparison with the 0 21 0 20 0 16 and 0 15 for the situation without pms addition the improved anti fouling performance might be due to that the m2 al lmo loaded on am could activate pms to generate reactive oxygen species ros while the ros would degrade nom molecules accumulating on the membrane thus slowing down the decay of membrane normalized flux the mitigating extent of membrane fouling is determined by the catalytic activity of m2 al lmos and the coal am exhibited the lowest normalized flux decline among the catalytic membranes which probably due to the highest content of ros produced in coal am pms system as discussed in detail in section 3 4 the fouling resistance distribution of the different membrane systems were shown in fig 3 c in the systems without pms addition the irreversible fouling resistance of these four membranes were ordered as am mnal am cual am coal am when pms was added in the filtration system the reversible fouling was remarkably reduced for all the membranes however the irreversible fouling resistance of mnal am and cual am were shown to be even higher than the case without pms this might be attributed to the fact that though mnal am and cual am could activate pms to generate ros for the degradation of nom but their overall oxidation capacity were limited and the produced medium molecules could block the membrane pores thus exacerbating the irreversible membrane fouling it was also seen from fig 3 c that the coal am exhibited the highest hydraulic cleaning efficiency in comparison with other membranes for both cases of without and with pms addition 3 2 2 removals of uv254 and toc fig 4 shows the removal of uv254 and toc in am and m2 al am systems with or without pms addition during treating surface water as shown in fig 4 a these membranes rejected uv254 by about 10 20 without the addition of pms when pms was introduced the removal rate of am was only slightly improved by contrast the uv254 removal was strengthened significantly in the m2 al am pms systems which reached to 39 29 41 94 and 65 43 for mnal am cual am coal am respectively as mentioned earlier m2 al lmo loaded on membrane surface can activate pms to generate ros and oxidize high molecular weight mw nom into small mw substances or even mineralize them therefore there may be an increase or decrease of toc concentration in the permeate after pms addition while the specific situation is determined by the ability of lmo to activate pms as can be seen from fig 4 a the toc removal by am mnal am and cual am systems were all shown to be decreased to some extent which could be due to that a portion of nom macromolecules were degraded into small mw organic substances and the later passed through the membrane pores more easily and thus increasing the permeate toc content while for the coal am system it was observed that the toc removal was significantly enhanced after pms addition which might be due to the higher mineralization of nom during pms based advanced oxidation leading to the efficient reduction of toc content fig 4 b showed the molecular weight distribution of nom in raw water and treated water by different m2 al am pms systems the organic molecular weight in the raw water was mostly concentrated at around 10000 da in the presence of pms the molecular weight distribution was significantly decreased after treatment by the catalytic membranes among which the lowest mw peak was observed for coal am this result was in good agreement with the trend of toc removal 3 2 3 fluorescent organic matter eem was used to characterize the variation of fluorescent substances in the water during treatment by different catalytic membranes from fig s5 it can be seen that the raw water mainly contain humic and proteins which have been recognized as major membrane foulants and both of them can cause the decline of membrane flux by parallel factor analysis three fluorescent components were identified and labeled as component 1 c1 component 2 c2 and component 3 c3 as can be seen in the eem contour plots fig 5 a c c1 appears at the ex wavelength of 220 240 nm 300 330 nm and em wavelength of 390 430 nm which belongs to the microbial derived humic like substances c2 ex em 250 280 nm 370 nm 450 500 nm is attributed to terrestrial derived humic like substances and c3 ex em 235 nm 290nm 330 350 nm is related to tryptophan like proteins tian et al 2018 fig 5 d f showed the variations in the removal of fluorescence components during filtration by am and different m2 al am with the addition of pms it was clear that no matter which fluorescent component was concerned the highest degradation removal nearly 100 was witnessed by the coal am pms system followed by the cual am pms mnal am pms and am pms systems the pms concentration in the membrane permeate was shown in fig s6 as can be seen the coal am system exhibited the greatest consumption of pms 90 followed by cual am and mnal am which were consistent with the fluorescent substance degradation this result confirmed once again that the coal lmo loaded on membrane surface can activate pms and produce ros efficiently thus favoring the degradation of membrane foulants and leading to effective mitigation of membrane fouling from fig s7 it was observed that the leaching of co ions were always below 0 6 mg l throughout the filtration which were even lower than the cu leaching from cual am at the latter part of filtration process suggesting the excellent stability of coal am 3 3 characterization of fouled membranes the membrane surface morphology after fouling and cleaning were shown in fig 6 ⅰ the membrane surface were obviously accumulated with nom after fouling and the membrane pores were blocked in large areas after cleaning the membrane surface foulants were significantly removed and some membrane pores were re exposed the degree of membrane fouling could also be indicated by the membrane surface roughness rms as can be seen from the afm images fig s8 the membrane surface rms value decreased after fouling and the rms value decreased more significantly as the fouling increased the rms values were shown to be increased after cleaning the full spectrum of xps for the different elements on membrane surface are shown in fig s9 it can be found that the fouled membrane surface mainly contains the elements of c o and n where c and o elements have a large relative strength as can be seen in fig 6 ⅱ four obvious chemical binding signals appeared at 285 6 ev 284 2 ev 287 0 ev and 287 9 ev which represented aliphatic carbon c c aromatic carbon c c carboxylic carbon o c o and ketonic carbon c o respectively lin et al 2014 all the four functional groups appeared on fresh membrane surface among which the c c was the major component might be due to the carbonization of the dispersant peg during calcination process for the fouled membranes the relative content of c o and o c o functional groups on membrane surface increased while the c c and c c components were reduced which might be due to the nom adhering to the membrane the relative content of c o and o c o functional groups decreased again after cleaning since the humus and proteins are enriched in c o and o c o functional groups it could be speculated that the main nom fractions causing membrane fouling were humic and protein like substances this result was also consistent with the fluorescent component analysis in section 3 2 3 specifically the relative increase of c o and o c o on membrane surface after fouling followed the order am coal am cual am mnal am indicating that more nom deposited on the mnal am surface it was worth noting that less change of functional groups was observed on the surface of am even though the most severe membrane flux decay was observed for am the reason might be that the xps preferred to analyze the elements on membrane surface while for am organic foulants might accumulate in the sub surface due to the large membrane pores and as a result xps could not make an accurate analysis for the membrane foulants on am 3 4 the possible catalytic mechanism in order to explore the catalytic mechanism of the catalytic reaction we explored from the following three aspects the probe organic compound removal the effect of ros quenchers on membrane flux and the interface free energy between the membrane and the foulant 3 4 1 removal of probe organic compound nom contains a complex organic matrix with different mw and functional groups to explore the catalytic mechanism of the m2 al am pms systems during filtration of actual surface water we first chose bpa a well investigated organic pollutant in the literature chen et al 2019 lin et al 2020 as the probe organic compound to determine the ros in the catalytic system the actual water spiked with 10 mg l of bpa was employed as the feed water the bpa concentration in the permeate during membrane filtration with different ros quenchers is shown in fig 7 in the absence of pms the membranes only exhibited a negligible removal of bpa by adsorption and or rejection which was excluded to consideration in the subsequent analysis in the presence of pms 74 03 63 46 and 100 of bpa removal were achieved within 30 min by the mnal am pms cual am pms and coal am pms systems respectively meoh and tba the common inhibitors of hydroxyl and sulfate radicals hu et al 2017 had essentially no effect on bpa degradation when added to the m2 al am pms systems so it can be speculated that no free radicals were produced in the systems when phenol a well documented surface bound radical inhibitor liang et al 2013 was added to the system the degradation of the bpa was significantly inhibited and the inhibition effect gradually increased with the increase of phenol content indicating the presence of surface bound free radicals in the catalytic system to explore the presence of non free radical ros in the system ffa as a common singlet oxygen inhibitor was added in the filtration systems bai et al 2022 the results showed that the addition of ffa could also inhibit bpa degradation to a significant extent and the inhibition increased with the increasing content of ffa demonstrating that the singlet oxygen was also present in the systems the above results displayed that the m2 al am pms was a complex catalytic system with both surface bound radical and singlet oxygen as major ros 3 4 2 effect of ros quenchers on membrane flux the addition of quenchers can suppress the generation of reactive oxygen species and inhibit the degradation of membrane foulants manifested by an accelerated decrease in membrane flux the membrane normalized flux under the addition of different quenchers is shown in fig 8 compared to the m2 al am pms systems without quenchers the addition of meoh and tba had little effect on membrane flux in mnal am pms and cual am pms systems while for the coal am pms system a slightly aggravated membrane fouling was observed upon the addition of meoh and tba implying that free sulfate and hydroxyl radicals may exist in the coal am pms system this result was not consistent with that observed when using bpa as probe organic compound when phoh was added to the system more severe membrane flux decaying was witnessed in all m2 al am pms systems indicating that surface bound radicals existed in the systems the ffa had no effect on the membrane flux in the mnal am pms system but exacerbated membrane fouling in the cual am pms and coal am pms systems suggesting singlet oxygen also contributed to the mitigation of membrane fouling in cual am pms and coal am pms systems notably the effect of ros quenchers on membrane flux decline did not exactly match that judged by bpa degradation we speculated that it might be due to the interaction of quenchers with the membranes affecting the membrane fouling behavior however the exact reason still requires further study to clarify 3 4 3 interface free energy between the membrane and foulant the interface interaction between the membrane and foulants under different conditions was further investigated to clarify the mechanism for membrane fouling mitigation according to the contact angles measured by using three probe liquids tables s3 s5 we can obtain the surface tension parameters for the membranes and membrane foulants γ γ γlw γab and γtot through eqs 4 6 table 2 and 3 thereafter the interface free energies δgflm lw δgflm ab and δgflm tot between the membranes and foulants were calculated through eqs 1 3 and shown in fig 9 as can be seen all the δgflm lw was negative which indicated the attractive lw interactions between the membrane and the foulants in contrast the δgflm ab was all positive indicating a repulsive ab interactions between the membrane and foulants in fig 9 a the change trend of δgflm ab was similar to that of δgflm tot due to that the absolute value of δgflm ab was much higher than that of δgflm lw indicating the dominant role of ab free energy in the total interaction energy zhao et al 2020 before filtration the δgflm tot between the membranes and nom in raw surface water r0 were ordered as coal am am cual am mnal am while after catalytic filtration the δgflm tot value became greater than the corresponding values before filtration indicating that addition of pms can increase the interface free energy between the foulants and membranes thus mitigating the membrane fouling notably the mitigation of membrane fouling did not necessarily imply an increase in toc removal rate in the permeate the change of toc values in the permeate mainly depended on the ability of the catalyst to activate pms as analyzed in section 3 2 2 fig 4 a to explore the effect of ros quenchers on the interaction between the foulants and membrane we took the coal am pms system as an example to investigate the interface free energies in the presence of meoh tba phoh and ffa respectively as can be seen from fig 9 b the δgflm tot decreased after the addition of quenchers in the system indicating that the existence of quenchers decreased the repulsion between the foulant and membrane which made the membrane more easily to be fouled the addition of meoh and tba caused a slight decrease in the δgflm tot indicating a small amount of free sulfate and hydroxyl radicals might existed in the coal am pms system and played a minor role in the degradation of nom which was in accordance with the membrane flux decline behavior in fig 8 c it was noteworthy the addition of phoh decreased the δgflm tot value significantly from strongly positive to slightly negative which contributed to a much more severe membrane flux decaying as shown in fig 8 c further confirming the important role played by surface bound radicals in the coal am pms system the δgflm tot also exhibited a little decrease after ffa addition indicating that the presence of ffa had inhibited the oxidative degradation of nom to some extent and slightly weakened the repulsion between the membrane and foulants moreover it was noticed that there was some correlation between the δgflm tot and permeate toc value for the systems added with different quenchers fig s10 the permeate toc was shown to be decreased with the decrease of δgflm tot which could be attributed to the addition of quenchers inhibited the nom oxidation by ros generated by the catalytic membrane according to the results obtained in the experiments the mechanism for nom catalytic oxidation and membrane fouling mitigation in the m2 al am pms system was proposed as schematically illustrated in fig 10 when the feed water containing both nom and pms passed through the catalytic layer of the membrane the pms had a contact reaction with m2 al lmo on the outer surface of the catalysts and thus produce large amounts of surface bound radicals and singlet oxygen as the major ros which was accompanied by the change of the valence state of the metal elements eqs 7 9 fig s11 the nom in the feed water would be rapidly degraded after contacting with these ros with the decrease of nom molecular weight and removal of uv254 fluorescent components eq 10 as a result the interface adhesion free energy between the catalytic membane and nom foulants would be enhanced thus leading to the effective alleviation of nom fouling potential on the membrane in addition due to the efficient in situ oxidation the water quality of permeate water from the catalytic ceramic membrane would also be improved 7 m n 1 h s o 5 m n s o 5 h 8 m n h s o 5 m n 1 s o 4 o h o h s o 4 2 9 2 s o 5 h 2 o 1 5 1 o 2 2 h s o 4 10 s o 4 o h 1 o 2 n o m s m a l l m o l e c u l e s i n t e r m e d i a t e s c o 2

conclusions could be drawn 1 the m2 al am catalytic membranes exhibited different propensity to membrane fouling by nom in surface water in the presence of pms among which coal am showed the lowest flux decline and highest removal of uv254 and toc 2 three fluorescent organic components were identified in the surface water by parafac analysis with the addition of pms the fluorescent component removal by different membranes followed the order coal am cual am mnal am am 3 the surface bound radicals and singlet oxygen were confirmed to be the major ros in m2 al am pms systems the addition of pms could increase the interface free energy between the foulants and membranes thus enhancing the repulsion effect and mitigating membrane fouling declaration of competing interest the authors

15642,clarifying the pattern of relative nitrogen n to phosphorus p requirements for phytoplankton growth is of great significance for eutrophication mitigation and aquatic system management the relative n to p requirement for phytoplankton growth is considered an essential trait determining species dominance within ecosystems and explaining phytoplankton response to nutrient availability these requirements vary with environmental trophic status though this variation remains unclear here we evaluated the relative n to p requirements under different absolute nutrient levels using previous and current experimental data on eight phytoplankton species three studied by us and five extrapolated from previous studies results showed that relative n to p requirements for phytoplankton growth decreased as absolute nutrient levels increased thus n may be crucial for enhancing phytoplankton growth under low nutrient conditions whereas p may be the primary limiting factor of phytoplankton growth under sufficient nutrient conditions this result applies to single species as well as species assemblages which are independent of species shifts occurring along water n p gradients the response observed in our large trophic status gradient may help elucidate the relative importance of n and p reductions in mitigating the impact of eutrophication on ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrogen phosphorus trophic status phytoplankton nitrogen to phosphorus ratio limiting factor data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrogen n and phosphorus p are two key macronutrients utilized in the biochemical functions of phytoplankton and are the main nutrients limiting phytoplankton growth in aquatic ecosystems elser et al 2007 paerl 2009 abell et al 2010 the relative importance of the n to p supply i e the supply n p ratio for phytoplankton growth remains an important subject in research on waterbodies with various trophic statuses including research on controlling nuisance phytoplankton blooms in eutrophic waters lewis et al 2011 paerl et al 2011 2016 and enhancing primary production and thus enhancing zooplankton biomass and fish production in oligotrophic waters budy et al 1998 reeder 2017 however the relative importance of these two elements for phytoplankton growth remains controversial p is generally considered the main factor responsible for controlling phytoplankton growth carpenter 2008 schindler et al 2008 largely because the nitrogen fixation of some cyanobacterial species can fulfill their n requirements smith 1990 contrastingly n limits phytoplankton growth during bloom conditions in some eutrophic lakes chaffin et al 2013 accordingly a dual nutrient control n p strategy is considered more effective in controlling phytoplankton growth than either nutrient alone elser et al 2007 lewis et al 2011 paerl et al 2016 regardless related studies have mainly focused on the relative n p ratio and have seldom mentioned the influence of absolute nutrient levels which vary greatly as p accumulates faster than n in freshwaters exposed to anthropogenic impacts the relationship between total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp is relevant to the trophic status of a waterbody that is high tn tp ratios are present in oligotrophic waters and low tn tp ratios are present in eutrophic waters downing and mccauley 1992 yan et al 2016 qin et al 2020 zhou et al 2022a 2022b however absolute nutrient concentrations may have a greater impact on phytoplankton growth than relative nutrient ratios because phytoplankton tend to be insensitive to resource stoichiometry during their fast growing phase klausmeier et al 2004 hillebrand et al 2013 yang et al 2020 accordingly if absolute nutrient concentrations are not considered discussions regarding n p ratios become largely inaccurate therefore establishing situations of various n p ratios with different nutrient levels is a prerequisite for evaluating the relative importance of n p ratios for phytoplankton growth most studies on relative n p requirements are based on observations of how phytoplankton respond to various supply n p ratios liu and vyverman 2015 rasdi and qin 2015 thrane et al 2016 2017 kelly et al 2021 however the importance of trophic status cannot be reflected by a single supply n p ratio series specifically phytoplankton biomass would increase with the increase in supply n p ratio when n was limiting and decrease with the increase in supply n p ratio when p was limiting a peak of phytoplankton biomass could be achieved at the supply n p ratio where n and p are co limiting which has been termed the optimal supply n p ratio the red line in fig 1 a and b sperfeld et al 2012 sperfeld et al 2016 tilman 1980 the optimal supply n p ratio is a definitive value derived from a gradient of supply n p ratios and an indicator for assessing the relative importance of n to p requirements thrane et al 2016 2017 however the definitive optimal supply value has various possibilities for example if a nutrient supply of 16 μmol n l 1 and 1 μmol p l 1 was calculated as the optimal supply n p ratio for the growth of a certain phytoplankton species we cannot easily generalize that 16 is the optimal supply n p ratio in any environmental condition although the nutrient supply of 16 μmol n l 1 and 1 μmol p l 1 was optimal in a specific series of n p ratios we cannot tell whether a nutrient combination of 32 μmol n l 1 and 2 μmol p l 1 or 8 μmol n l 1 and 0 5 μmol p l 1 would also be optimal among different supply n p ratio gradients despite having a ratio of 16 that is the relative n p requirement for phytoplankton may not be equivalent for higher or lower trophic statuses a definite optimal n p ratio indicates that the relative importance of the n to p requirement for phytoplankton growth remains unchanged under different trophic statuses red line in fig 1a and b yet n and p limitations affect phytoplankton cell physiology in significantly different ways protein is the largest n containing component in phytoplankton cells whereas p is distributed among phospholipids adenosine triphosphate and nucleic acids especially ribosomal ribonucleic acid rrna geider and la roche 2002 n limitation hampers phytoplankton photosynthesis by causing large declines in the availability of photosynthetic pigments and rubisco pools geider et al 1993 1998 meanwhile p limitation greatly suppresses phytoplankton growth because of the large investment of p in rrnas and the growth dependence of protein synthesis driven by p rich ribosomes sterner and elser 2002 loladze and elser 2011 owing to these differences in the physiological functions of n and p the relative importance of n p requirements for phytoplankton growth may vary temporally among different environmental conditions phytoplankton can regulate the contents of cellular complexes i e pigments and ribosomes to acclimate to different irradiance or temperature conditions which can further influence their relative n p requirement thrane et al 2016 2017 furthermore galbraith and martiny 2015 emphasized that the cellular p of phytoplankton has greater plasticity than cellular n resulting in high phytoplankton n p ratios in oligotrophic waterbodies phytoplankton may have a basic and steady requirement for n whereas their demand for p may be much more flexible and dependent on phytoplankton growth and nutrient availability herein we propose that optimal supply n p ratios would be flexible under different trophic statuses and would decline with an increase in absolute nutrient levels fig 1b and c we assumed that the response of n fixing cyanobacteria to supply n p ratios may differ from other phytoplankton species due to their higher tolerance to n starvation we tested these hypotheses using previous and present experimental data on eight phytoplankton species most of the phytoplankton species tested in the present study including an n fixing cyanobacterium yielded similar results supporting our hypothesis trophic status is negatively related to the n p ratio required for optimal growth 2 materials and methods 2 1 biological material we used three phytoplankton species the green algae chlorella vulgaris nies 2172 the cyanobacteria anabaena variabilis nies 2093 n fixing cyanobacterium and microcystis aeruginosa nies 44 all axenic stock cultures were obtained from the microbial culture collection of the national institute for environmental studies tsukuba japan stock cultures were transferred into a modified bg 11 medium added with 0 1 μmol l 1 vitamin b12 and 0 1 μmol l 1 biotin all stock cultures were grown under controlled conditions with a light intensity of 15 µmol photons m2 s 1 cool white fluorescent light and a temperature of 24 c for a two transfer acclimation period 2 2 experimental design to maximize the absolute nutrient concentration and the supply n p ratio gradients we set the concentrations of n and p to have 12 levels each table s1 and fig s1 according to trophic state classification criteria the nutrient levels for n and p range from oligotrophic to hypereutrophic schlesinger and bernhardt 2020 forty eight combinations of n and p were prepared for each of the three phytoplankton species with each level of n or p replicated four times fig s1 the concentration of all other nutrients was determined based on the composition of the bg 11 medium which reduced the risk of nutrient limitation by factors other than n and p to test whether the effects of the n p ratio on phytoplankton growth would change under different trophic statuses we categorized the combinations of resource stoichiometries into a series of nutrient levels accordingly we defined the nutrient levels of different resource stoichiometries by assigning weights to n and p the nutrient supply level nsl was defined as the combined result of the absolute concentrations of n and p and expressed as nsl cn 16cp 32 where cn and cp represent the concentrations of n and p resources μmol l 1 respectively the weight allocated to p was defined as 16 times n based on the redfield ratio the average n p ratio of 16 1 observed in marine phytoplankton redfield 1934 thus the nsl of a nutrient resource combination with 16 μmol l 1 n and 1 μmol l 1 p would be calculated as 1 all n and p combinations white dots on decreasing diagonal lines shared the same nsl value and the value increased across the x y plane fig s1 this method ensured that each specific n p ratio value could be found for any nsl 2 3 experiment execution we conducted the experiment using 48 well microplates agc techno glass co ltd shizuoka japan with each well containing 750 μl medium prepared based on the modified bg 11 medium described above prior to the experiment exponentially growing cultures were harvested through centrifugation 4000 g for 8 min washed with ultrapure water transferred into bg 11 medium modified to be n free nano3 replaced with an equimolar equivalent of nacl and ferric ammonium citrate substituted with ferric citrate and p free k2hpo4 replaced with an equimolar equivalent of kcl and cultivated under the aforementioned conditions for three days to reduce the effects of n and p stored in phytoplankton cells huang et al 2014 ren et al 2017 at the start of the experiment day 0 each well was inoculated with 40 μl phytoplankton stock culture initial optical density at 595 nm od595 0 05 background od595 of the bg 11 medium was approximately 0 03 0 04 all microplates were kept in a climate controlled room at 24 c with a 16 8 h light dark cycle of 15 μmol photons s 1 m 2 cool white fluorescent light irradiance was measured using an li 1400 data logger with an li 190sa sensor li cor lincoln ne usa all microplates were covered with a gas permeable sealing membrane breathe easy sigma aldrich st louis mo usa to prevent evaporation and microbial contamination and to allow free gas exchange with the environment the microplates were randomly rearranged daily to ensure comparable light conditions during the experiment the experiments were initiated in batch cultures after one week of cultivation we shifted the batch cultures into semi continuous cultures the dilution rate was 0 15 d 1 which was achieved by replacing 15 of the well volume with fresh culture medium under a laminar flow cabinet every day to refresh the culture media and extend the steady state growth phase concurrently with the refreshment of the culture media repetitive pipetting was conducted to thoroughly mix the phytoplankton each experiment was terminated when the respective culture reached the steady state growth phase 2 4 monitoring phytoplankton growth to determine whether the phytoplankton cultures had reached a quasi steady state the od595 in each well was measured daily using a microplate reader infinite f200 pro tecan group ltd männedorf switzerland od595 has been widely used as a proxy for monitoring phytoplankton growth huesemann et al 2009 kapoore et al 2019 we demonstrated that od595 is highly correlated with the cell density of the three phytoplankton species fig s2a c however od measurements for phytoplankton biomass are susceptible to errors due to pigment interference during different growth phases griffiths et al 2011 therefore to better evaluate the culture biomass a colorimetric analysis was performed according to our preparatory work jiang and nakano 2021 immediately before cell enumeration of the three phytoplankton species day 14 for a variabilis day 16 for m aeruginosa and day 21 for c vulgaris rgb red green and blue color information for the phytoplankton cultures was collected using a free mobile application called color meter https apps apple com us app color meter id1512406137 accessed on 1st december 2021 the rgb color information was then converted into the hsi hue saturation intensity color space for subsequent analysis jiang and nakano 2021 the results indicated that variations in the hue of the experimental phytoplankton cultures were limited fig s3a thereby verifying the validity of the optical and colorimetric analyses additionally the measurements of the phytoplankton biomass via od595 and color intensity were highly correlated fig s3b d we used the results of the optical and colorimetric analyses to confirm that the cultures reached a quasi steady state as the timing varied depending on the cultivation conditions fig s4 however the steady state of the phytoplankton in some experimental units could not be maintained for an extended period due to nutrient limitation fig s4 thus it was difficult to accurately and timely judge whether the cultures reached a steady state during the experiments therefore the steady state od595 was estimated as the mean of the od595 values greater than 95 of the maximum od595 during the growth period for each experimental unit we counted the cell density during the quasi steady state or near the peak of the growth curves with a neubauer hemocytometer brand wertheim germany under an optical microscope olympus bx51 olympus tokyo japan the steady state phytoplankton cell density c steady state was calculated as c steady state c count o d 595 steady state o d 595 bg 11 o d 595 count o d 595 bg 11 where od595 count represents the od595 of the counted subsamples od595 steady state represents the steady state od595 c count represents the phytoplankton cell density counted on the sampling day and od595 bg 11 is the background od595 value of the bg 11 medium which was estimated to be 0 035 using a microplate reader infinite f200 pro tecan austria 2 5 determining the transitions between n and p requirements each phytoplankton species contained 48 experimental units which were classified into several different nsls fig s1 we established relationships between the supply n p ratio and the steady state phytoplankton cell density for four nsls 0 91 1 24 1 58 and 1 91 figs 2 and s5 the transitions between n and p limitation at each nsl were calculated using the one dimensional locally weighted sequential smoothing method 1d loess loess function in base r by drawing peak shaped relationship curves fig 2 the parameter span which controls the degree of smoothing in 1d loess was accepted at its default value of 0 75 the 1d loess method provided results for limited nsls because it can only estimate the relationships between supply n p ratios and phytoplankton biomass based on experimental units sharing the same nsl value fig 2 to obtain a continuous relationship between the optimal n p ratio and the nsl we estimated the relationships between two related variables n and p concentrations and an outcome phytoplankton cell density during the steady state phase using a two dimensional loess curve with a default span of 0 75 2d loess loess function in base r by fitting the available 48 experimental data points to the 2d loess model the steady state cell density could be calculated for any possible combination of n and p resource concentrations using the predict function in base r the estimates for each combination of n and p concentrations were generated into a matrix and visualized through contour plots to show a smoothing relationship between the resource stoichiometry and phytoplankton biomass fig 3 a c each value of the phytoplankton density on the 2d loess contours was estimated according to pre defined n p locations https stat ethz ch pipermail r help 2007 february 125269 html accessed on 1st december 2021 the phytoplankton density at the intermediate nsls 0 74 1 94 was calculated with an interval of 0 12 based on the estimates from the 2d loess contours for each nsl the cell density of each supply n p ratio was extracted at an interval of less than 0 01 generating smoothing curves that described the relationships between the supply n p ratio and phytoplankton density fig s6 we sorted through all phytoplankton density estimates with different supply n p ratios and extracted the maximum value whose n p ratio was regarded as the most optimal for that nsl fig 3d f the analytical process for determining the optimal supply n p ratios of different nutrient levels using 2d loess is shown in fig s7 2 6 literature dataset analyses published datasets from previous studies were compared with the results of the present study datasets were selected based on the four following criteria 1 phytoplankton monocultures were cultivated under conditions with different absolute and relative n and p concentrations 2 the combinations of the supply n and p concentrations were sufficient for calculating the optimal n p ratios for at least two nsls 3 the cultures were cultivated through the steady state phase and the steady state biomass was determined and 4 n and p were the only limiting factors for phytoplankton growth during cultivation although studies have focused on the influence of supply n p ratios on phytoplankton growth the majority of the obtained datasets did not cover two or more nsls nevertheless datasets derived from frank et al 2020 and kunikane et al 1984 fulfilled the aforementioned criteria for frank et al 2020 we applied the 2d loess method described above to determine the effects of the nsl on the optimal supply n p ratios during the steady state for the same four phytoplankton species in monoculture ankistrodesmus sp chlamydomonas reinhardtii scenedesmus obliquus and staurastrum sp fig 4 a d and in admixture fig 4e optimal supply n p ratios at the nsls from 1 7 to 4 7 were estimated with an interval of 0 1 and only the nsls resulting in a unimodal curve with a peak the curve describes the relationship between steady state phytoplankton biomass and the supply n p ratios fig s7 were applied to assess the impacts of the nsl on the optimal supply n p ratio figs 4f j s7 in kunikane et al 1984 higher dilution rates led to higher available n and p concentrations in the medium during the steady state phase which was equivalent to the high nsls used in the present study we calculated the transitions between n and p requirements using smoothing spline curves in graphpad prism graphpad san diego ca usa fig 4k and l the dataset in frank et al 2020 was directly obtained from the authors whereas the data presented in fig 4 of kunikane et al 1984 was estimated using the open access digitizing software engauge digitizer version 12 1 because we were unable to contact the authors 3 results for most of the nsls of the three phytoplankton species the steady state phytoplankton density followed a significant unimodal relationship with the supply n p ratio with the exceptions of c vulgaris and a variabilis cultures at the nsl of 1 91 fig 2 the optimal ratios estimated using 1d loess generally decreased with an increased nsl fig 2 2d loess predictions of the relationships between the supply n p ratio and the nsl were obtained from all 48 experimental units rather than only the experimental units having the same nsl fig 3a c and this method generated more detailed relationships between the optimal supply n p ratio and the nsl the results of the 2d loess models showed the same pattern as the 1d loess the optimal supply n p ratio decreased with the increase in nsl for all three studied phytoplankton species fig 3d f the datasets obtained from the literature also supported this trend three of the four phytoplankton species studied by frank et al 2020 were found to have a decrease in the optimal supply n p ratio with an increasing nsl fig 4f i c reinhardtii was the only exception as its optimal supply n p ratios were distributed in a narrow range mean sd 23 9 1 2 fig 4i in addition the results of the mixed culture in frank et al 2020 showed a similar trend of a decreasing optimal supply n p ratio with nsls fig 4j the calculated results of the data from kunikane et al 1984 indicated that the optimal n p ratios of s dimorphus decreased with the increase in dilution rate fig 4l at the steady state observed in the chemostat the growth rate of the phytoplankton density was equal to the dilution rate in other words phytoplankton with high growth rates tended to require more p than n overall seven out of the eight analyzed phytoplankton species exhibited a decreasing optimal supply n p ratio with the increase in nutrient availability this trend was achieved under different culture conditions i e semi continuous culture in the present study batch cultures in frank et al 2020 and chemostat cultures in kunikane et al 1984 and methods for regulating the absolute nutrient concentrations i e varying input nutrients in the present study and frank et al 2020 varying dilution rates in kunikane et al 1984 although the optimal supply n p ratio generally decreased with the increase in nsl the downward trend was not immutable especially for high nsls the decline tended to level off at high nsls or high dilution rates in the chemostat experiment which was observed in half of the studied species c vulgaris and m aeruginosa cultures in the present experiments fig 3 s obliquus staurastrum sp and mixed cultures in frank et al 2020 and s dimorphus in kunikane et al 1984 fig 4 4 discussion n and p requirements for phytoplankton growth seem to be flexible among various trophic statuses as reflected by the decrease of the optimal supply n p ratio with the increase in nsl the optimal supply n p ratio was defined as the supply n p ratio in a medium where the transition from n limitation to p limitation for phytoplankton growth occurred we found only one exception c reinhardtii among the eight studied species fig 4d and i while stable ranges of the optimal supply n p ratio were observed in half of the other phytoplankton cultures at high nsls therefore we cannot identify whether the optimal supply n p ratio for c reinhardtii was truly stable over all nsls or whether the nsls studied by frank et al 2020 were too high to cover the decreasing ranges of the optimal supply n p ratio despite this exception a significant proportion of the phytoplankton species supported the conclusion that phytoplankton has higher n requirements than p requirements at low nsls or vice versa at high nsls although we focused mainly on monocultures in the present study it is noteworthy that the mixed cultures studied in frank et al 2020 produced similar results that support our hypothesis fig 4j the trend of decreasing optimal supply n p ratio with nsls was unaffected by species shifts within the mixed cultures all four species in the mixed cultures belonged to a single phylum chlorophyta however we have not yet determined whether our hypothesis is also applicable to mixed cultures comprising various taxa to the best of our knowledge this study is the first to demonstrate that trophic status is negatively related to the relative n p requirement for phytoplankton growth changes in the optimal n p ratio at different nsls could be explained by the growth rate hypothesis which states that the variation in cellular n p ratios is largely attributed to cellular protein and rrna contents elser et al 2000 sterner and elser 2002 as proteins are the largest cellular n pool and rrnas are the largest contributor of p to phytoplankton cells geider and la roche 2002 sterner and elser 2002 for phytoplankton cultures under the same supply n p ratio but at different nsls higher nsls or high dilution rates in the chemostat experiment likely increased nutrient availability and promoted phytoplankton growth resulting in higher biomass fig 2 4 phytoplankton growth enhancement would increase the rrna requirement resulting in a higher requirement of p relative to n it is also possible that the changes in the optimal n p ratios were related to certain adaptive responses of phytoplankton to low nutrient supplies in low p environments phytoplankton would selectively increase the synthesis of p free compounds rather than p containing compounds to reduce the p demand such as by replacing phospholipids in cell membranes with sulfonated lipids snyder et al 2009 wurch et al 2011 however n seems to be more essential for phytoplankton photosynthesis than p n limitation in phytoplankton can cause a substantial decline in the content of the major photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll a and increase the amount of non photosynthetic pigments herrig and falkowski 1989 geider et al 1993 however the effects of p limitation on cellular chlorophyll a are relatively smaller than those of n limitation geider et al 1998 in addition n limitation may greatly reduce the efficiency of photosystem ii and the relative abundance of rubisco in phytoplankton cells falkowski et al 1989 geider et al 1993 whereas p limitation moderately affects phytoplankton photosystems geider et al 1998 accordingly we assumed that phytoplankton may have a steady n requirement because of its importance for photosynthesis while the p requirement may be more flexible via adaptation and acclimation responses this assumption is consistent with the results of galbraith and martiny 2015 who found that the cellular abundance of n in phytoplankton tends to be less plastic than the p content phytoplankton under dual n and p limitation therefore would show a higher requirement for n than p the decreasing curve of the optimal n p ratio tended to level off with increasing nsl as observed in half of the studied phytoplankton species figs 3 and 4 for datasets derived from experiments with a factorial design the present study and frank et al 2020 high nsls were only studied with limited experimental units and the supply n p ratios of these units were distributed in a narrow range as shown in fig 2 the peaks of the unimodal curves became indistinct at high nsls and the optimal supply n p ratios for c vulgaris and a variabilis at the nsl of 1 91 molar supply n p ratios distributed from 7 71 to 33 29 could not be identified using the 1d loess method hence the disappearance of the decreasing trend may be partly explained by the factorial design used in the present study and by frank et al 2020 the data of kunikane et al 1984 showed similar results as the optimal n p ratio became stable at high absolute nsls fig 4l however this trend could not be explained by the same reason because nsls were regulated by dilution rates instead of nutrient input thus stable optimal n p ratios at high nsls may not be a coincidence stable optimal n p ratios at high nsls may result from the decrease in nutrient affinity alongside the increase in absolute nutrient concentrations smith et al 2009 bonachela et al 2011 phytoplankton cells can increase the number of surface uptake sites proteins that incorporate nutrients from the cell membrane into the cytoplasm to increase the encounter with nutrients in low nutrient waterbodies smith et al 2009 bonachela et al 2011 leading to a high nutrient affinity for phytoplankton cells with the increase in nutrient availability phytoplankton growth is no longer limited by extracellular nutrients and the nutrient uptake rates are thus controlled by intracellular enzymes that assimilate the encountered nutrients smith et al 2009 therefore we can find explicitly decreasing curves of optimal n p ratios under low nsls due to the high nutrient affinity in this phase and the curves become stable at high nsls because of the decrease in nutrient affinity fig 5 for high nsls the optimal supply n p ratios can be calculated using the 2d loess method fig 3 but cannot always be estimated using the 1d loess method fig 2 the optimal n p ratios at high nsls derived from the 2d loess method were calculated using experimental units of both high nsls and low nsls the values calculated on the smoothing curves of high nsls could be regarded as an inertial extension of values estimated at low nsls thus although the optimal n p ratios at high nsls could be calculated mathematically the ecological significance of the calculated n p ratios would be negligible fig 5 another possible reason for the indistinction of the optimal supply n p ratios at high trophic levels could be the low light intensity 15 µmol photons m2 s 1 used in the present study at high nsls low light intensity is more likely to be the main limiting factor for phytoplankton growth compared to n and p thus the limiting effects of low light intensity may mask the effects of n and p and ultimately lead to the indistinction of the optimal supply n p ratios the cyanobacterium a variabilis is capable of nitrogen fixation thiel et al 2014 which is thought to have the potential to offset the decline in the resource n supply the results indicate that the optimal supply n p ratios for a variabilis cultures at low nsls are much higher than those at high nsls figs 2b and 3d in other words nitrogen fixation in a variabilis cells did not offset the decline in the n supply which supports the idea that although nitrogen fixation could stimulate cyanobacterial growth cyanobacterial n fixers do not fully compensate for n deficiency lewis and wurtsbaugh 2008 scott and mccarthy 2010 experimental setups and culture systems varied between this experiment and those of previous studies from which datasets were used in the present study kunikane et al 1984 frank et al 2020 nsls calculated from batch cultures in frank et al 2020 were almost 2 5 fold higher than nsls calculated using data derived from the present semi continuous cultures in the present study figs 3 and 4 because the initial nutrient level of the batch cultures was higher than that of the semi continuous cultures additionally both values and changing ranges of optimal supply n p ratios calculated from the present semi continuous cultures were lower and narrower than those in previous studies kunikane et al 1984 frank et al 2020 which could be attributed to the differences in experimental setups and phytoplankton taxa among the experiments additionally the light intensity applied in frank et al 2020 40 45 15 00 µmol photons m2 s 1 was much higher than that in our study 15 µmol photons m2 s 1 which could explain the broader optimal supply n p ratio ranges in frank et al 2020 5 conclusions the response curves depicting the relationships between the optimal supply n p ratio and trophic status varied among the eight tested phytoplankton species but seven of them showed similar declining trends our results support the idea that the transition from n requirements to p requirements is not a definite boundary but it varies depending on trophic status with lower nutrient supplies leading to higher n requirements than p requirements fig 5 the n vs p limitation for controlling phytoplankton growth has been discussed for decades but it still remains an open question schindler et al 2008 conley et al 2009 xu et al 2010 paerl et al 2016 the present study assumed that neither n nor p was superior in controlling phytoplankton growth p was considered to have high priority in conditions with sufficient n and p supplies i e phytoplankton blooms in eutrophic waterbodies which is consistent with studies showing that p is more effective in controlling eutrophication than n carpenter 2008 schindler et al 2008 in contrast we suggest that the importance of n to phytoplankton productivity is greater in environments with a low nutrient supply i e in oligotrophic waterbodies overall our results could be useful for the control of phytoplankton biomass and

15642,clarifying the pattern of relative nitrogen n to phosphorus p requirements for phytoplankton growth is of great significance for eutrophication mitigation and aquatic system management the relative n to p requirement for phytoplankton growth is considered an essential trait determining species dominance within ecosystems and explaining phytoplankton response to nutrient availability these requirements vary with environmental trophic status though this variation remains unclear here we evaluated the relative n to p requirements under different absolute nutrient levels using previous and current experimental data on eight phytoplankton species three studied by us and five extrapolated from previous studies results showed that relative n to p requirements for phytoplankton growth decreased as absolute nutrient levels increased thus n may be crucial for enhancing phytoplankton growth under low nutrient conditions whereas p may be the primary limiting factor of phytoplankton growth under sufficient nutrient conditions this result applies to single species as well as species assemblages which are independent of species shifts occurring along water n p gradients the response observed in our large trophic status gradient may help elucidate the relative importance of n and p reductions in mitigating the impact of eutrophication on ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrogen phosphorus trophic status phytoplankton nitrogen to phosphorus ratio limiting factor data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nitrogen n and phosphorus p are two key macronutrients utilized in the biochemical functions of phytoplankton and are the main nutrients limiting phytoplankton growth in aquatic ecosystems elser et al 2007 paerl 2009 abell et al 2010 the relative importance of the n to p supply i e the supply n p ratio for phytoplankton growth remains an important subject in research on waterbodies with various trophic statuses including research on controlling nuisance phytoplankton blooms in eutrophic waters lewis et al 2011 paerl et al 2011 2016 and enhancing primary production and thus enhancing zooplankton biomass and fish production in oligotrophic waters budy et al 1998 reeder 2017 however the relative importance of these two elements for phytoplankton growth remains controversial p is generally considered the main factor responsible for controlling phytoplankton growth carpenter 2008 schindler et al 2008 largely because the nitrogen fixation of some cyanobacterial species can fulfill their n requirements smith 1990 contrastingly n limits phytoplankton growth during bloom conditions in some eutrophic lakes chaffin et al 2013 accordingly a dual nutrient control n p strategy is considered more effective in controlling phytoplankton growth than either nutrient alone elser et al 2007 lewis et al 2011 paerl et al 2016 regardless related studies have mainly focused on the relative n p ratio and have seldom mentioned the influence of absolute nutrient levels which vary greatly as p accumulates faster than n in freshwaters exposed to anthropogenic impacts the relationship between total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp is relevant to the trophic status of a waterbody that is high tn tp ratios are present in oligotrophic waters and low tn tp ratios are present in eutrophic waters downing and mccauley 1992 yan et al 2016 qin et al 2020 zhou et al 2022a 2022b however absolute nutrient concentrations may have a greater impact on phytoplankton growth than relative nutrient ratios because phytoplankton tend to be insensitive to resource stoichiometry during their fast growing phase klausmeier et al 2004 hillebrand et al 2013 yang et al 2020 accordingly if absolute nutrient concentrations are not considered discussions regarding n p ratios become largely inaccurate therefore establishing situations of various n p ratios with different nutrient levels is a prerequisite for evaluating the relative importance of n p ratios for phytoplankton growth most studies on relative n p requirements are based on observations of how phytoplankton respond to various supply n p ratios liu and vyverman 2015 rasdi and qin 2015 thrane et al 2016 2017 kelly et al 2021 however the importance of trophic status cannot be reflected by a single supply n p ratio series specifically phytoplankton biomass would increase with the increase in supply n p ratio when n was limiting and decrease with the increase in supply n p ratio when p was limiting a peak of phytoplankton biomass could be achieved at the supply n p ratio where n and p are co limiting which has been termed the optimal supply n p ratio the red line in fig 1 a and b sperfeld et al 2012 sperfeld et al 2016 tilman 1980 the optimal supply n p ratio is a definitive value derived from a gradient of supply n p ratios and an indicator for assessing the relative importance of n to p requirements thrane et al 2016 2017 however the definitive optimal supply value has various possibilities for example if a nutrient supply of 16 μmol n l 1 and 1 μmol p l 1 was calculated as the optimal supply n p ratio for the growth of a certain phytoplankton species we cannot easily generalize that 16 is the optimal supply n p ratio in any environmental condition although the nutrient supply of 16 μmol n l 1 and 1 μmol p l 1 was optimal in a specific series of n p ratios we cannot tell whether a nutrient combination of 32 μmol n l 1 and 2 μmol p l 1 or 8 μmol n l 1 and 0 5 μmol p l 1 would also be optimal among different supply n p ratio gradients despite having a ratio of 16 that is the relative n p requirement for phytoplankton may not be equivalent for higher or lower trophic statuses a definite optimal n p ratio indicates that the relative importance of the n to p requirement for phytoplankton growth remains unchanged under different trophic statuses red line in fig 1a and b yet n and p limitations affect phytoplankton cell physiology in significantly different ways protein is the largest n containing component in phytoplankton cells whereas p is distributed among phospholipids adenosine triphosphate and nucleic acids especially ribosomal ribonucleic acid rrna geider and la roche 2002 n limitation hampers phytoplankton photosynthesis by causing large declines in the availability of photosynthetic pigments and rubisco pools geider et al 1993 1998 meanwhile p limitation greatly suppresses phytoplankton growth because of the large investment of p in rrnas and the growth dependence of protein synthesis driven by p rich ribosomes sterner and elser 2002 loladze and elser 2011 owing to these differences in the physiological functions of n and p the relative importance of n p requirements for phytoplankton growth may vary temporally among different environmental conditions phytoplankton can regulate the contents of cellular complexes i e pigments and ribosomes to acclimate to different irradiance or temperature conditions which can further influence their relative n p requirement thrane et al 2016 2017 furthermore galbraith and martiny 2015 emphasized that the cellular p of phytoplankton has greater plasticity than cellular n resulting in high phytoplankton n p ratios in oligotrophic waterbodies phytoplankton may have a basic and steady requirement for n whereas their demand for p may be much more flexible and dependent on phytoplankton growth and nutrient availability herein we propose that optimal supply n p ratios would be flexible under different trophic statuses and would decline with an increase in absolute nutrient levels fig 1b and c we assumed that the response of n fixing cyanobacteria to supply n p ratios may differ from other phytoplankton species due to their higher tolerance to n starvation we tested these hypotheses using previous and present experimental data on eight phytoplankton species most of the phytoplankton species tested in the present study including an n fixing cyanobacterium yielded similar results supporting our hypothesis trophic status is negatively related to the n p ratio required for optimal growth 2 materials and methods 2 1 biological material we used three phytoplankton species the green algae chlorella vulgaris nies 2172 the cyanobacteria anabaena variabilis nies 2093 n fixing cyanobacterium and microcystis aeruginosa nies 44 all axenic stock cultures were obtained from the microbial culture collection of the national institute for environmental studies tsukuba japan stock cultures were transferred into a modified bg 11 medium added with 0 1 μmol l 1 vitamin b12 and 0 1 μmol l 1 biotin all stock cultures were grown under controlled conditions with a light intensity of 15 µmol photons m2 s 1 cool white fluorescent light and a temperature of 24 c for a two transfer acclimation period 2 2 experimental design to maximize the absolute nutrient concentration and the supply n p ratio gradients we set the concentrations of n and p to have 12 levels each table s1 and fig s1 according to trophic state classification criteria the nutrient levels for n and p range from oligotrophic to hypereutrophic schlesinger and bernhardt 2020 forty eight combinations of n and p were prepared for each of the three phytoplankton species with each level of n or p replicated four times fig s1 the concentration of all other nutrients was determined based on the composition of the bg 11 medium which reduced the risk of nutrient limitation by factors other than n and p to test whether the effects of the n p ratio on phytoplankton growth would change under different trophic statuses we categorized the combinations of resource stoichiometries into a series of nutrient levels accordingly we defined the nutrient levels of different resource stoichiometries by assigning weights to n and p the nutrient supply level nsl was defined as the combined result of the absolute concentrations of n and p and expressed as nsl cn 16cp 32 where cn and cp represent the concentrations of n and p resources μmol l 1 respectively the weight allocated to p was defined as 16 times n based on the redfield ratio the average n p ratio of 16 1 observed in marine phytoplankton redfield 1934 thus the nsl of a nutrient resource combination with 16 μmol l 1 n and 1 μmol l 1 p would be calculated as 1 all n and p combinations white dots on decreasing diagonal lines shared the same nsl value and the value increased across the x y plane fig s1 this method ensured that each specific n p ratio value could be found for any nsl 2 3 experiment execution we conducted the experiment using 48 well microplates agc techno glass co ltd shizuoka japan with each well containing 750 μl medium prepared based on the modified bg 11 medium described above prior to the experiment exponentially growing cultures were harvested through centrifugation 4000 g for 8 min washed with ultrapure water transferred into bg 11 medium modified to be n free nano3 replaced with an equimolar equivalent of nacl and ferric ammonium citrate substituted with ferric citrate and p free k2hpo4 replaced with an equimolar equivalent of kcl and cultivated under the aforementioned conditions for three days to reduce the effects of n and p stored in phytoplankton cells huang et al 2014 ren et al 2017 at the start of the experiment day 0 each well was inoculated with 40 μl phytoplankton stock culture initial optical density at 595 nm od595 0 05 background od595 of the bg 11 medium was approximately 0 03 0 04 all microplates were kept in a climate controlled room at 24 c with a 16 8 h light dark cycle of 15 μmol photons s 1 m 2 cool white fluorescent light irradiance was measured using an li 1400 data logger with an li 190sa sensor li cor lincoln ne usa all microplates were covered with a gas permeable sealing membrane breathe easy sigma aldrich st louis mo usa to prevent evaporation and microbial contamination and to allow free gas exchange with the environment the microplates were randomly rearranged daily to ensure comparable light conditions during the experiment the experiments were initiated in batch cultures after one week of cultivation we shifted the batch cultures into semi continuous cultures the dilution rate was 0 15 d 1 which was achieved by replacing 15 of the well volume with fresh culture medium under a laminar flow cabinet every day to refresh the culture media and extend the steady state growth phase concurrently with the refreshment of the culture media repetitive pipetting was conducted to thoroughly mix the phytoplankton each experiment was terminated when the respective culture reached the steady state growth phase 2 4 monitoring phytoplankton growth to determine whether the phytoplankton cultures had reached a quasi steady state the od595 in each well was measured daily using a microplate reader infinite f200 pro tecan group ltd männedorf switzerland od595 has been widely used as a proxy for monitoring phytoplankton growth huesemann et al 2009 kapoore et al 2019 we demonstrated that od595 is highly correlated with the cell density of the three phytoplankton species fig s2a c however od measurements for phytoplankton biomass are susceptible to errors due to pigment interference during different growth phases griffiths et al 2011 therefore to better evaluate the culture biomass a colorimetric analysis was performed according to our preparatory work jiang and nakano 2021 immediately before cell enumeration of the three phytoplankton species day 14 for a variabilis day 16 for m aeruginosa and day 21 for c vulgaris rgb red green and blue color information for the phytoplankton cultures was collected using a free mobile application called color meter https apps apple com us app color meter id1512406137 accessed on 1st december 2021 the rgb color information was then converted into the hsi hue saturation intensity color space for subsequent analysis jiang and nakano 2021 the results indicated that variations in the hue of the experimental phytoplankton cultures were limited fig s3a thereby verifying the validity of the optical and colorimetric analyses additionally the measurements of the phytoplankton biomass via od595 and color intensity were highly correlated fig s3b d we used the results of the optical and colorimetric analyses to confirm that the cultures reached a quasi steady state as the timing varied depending on the cultivation conditions fig s4 however the steady state of the phytoplankton in some experimental units could not be maintained for an extended period due to nutrient limitation fig s4 thus it was difficult to accurately and timely judge whether the cultures reached a steady state during the experiments therefore the steady state od595 was estimated as the mean of the od595 values greater than 95 of the maximum od595 during the growth period for each experimental unit we counted the cell density during the quasi steady state or near the peak of the growth curves with a neubauer hemocytometer brand wertheim germany under an optical microscope olympus bx51 olympus tokyo japan the steady state phytoplankton cell density c steady state was calculated as c steady state c count o d 595 steady state o d 595 bg 11 o d 595 count o d 595 bg 11 where od595 count represents the od595 of the counted subsamples od595 steady state represents the steady state od595 c count represents the phytoplankton cell density counted on the sampling day and od595 bg 11 is the background od595 value of the bg 11 medium which was estimated to be 0 035 using a microplate reader infinite f200 pro tecan austria 2 5 determining the transitions between n and p requirements each phytoplankton species contained 48 experimental units which were classified into several different nsls fig s1 we established relationships between the supply n p ratio and the steady state phytoplankton cell density for four nsls 0 91 1 24 1 58 and 1 91 figs 2 and s5 the transitions between n and p limitation at each nsl were calculated using the one dimensional locally weighted sequential smoothing method 1d loess loess function in base r by drawing peak shaped relationship curves fig 2 the parameter span which controls the degree of smoothing in 1d loess was accepted at its default value of 0 75 the 1d loess method provided results for limited nsls because it can only estimate the relationships between supply n p ratios and phytoplankton biomass based on experimental units sharing the same nsl value fig 2 to obtain a continuous relationship between the optimal n p ratio and the nsl we estimated the relationships between two related variables n and p concentrations and an outcome phytoplankton cell density during the steady state phase using a two dimensional loess curve with a default span of 0 75 2d loess loess function in base r by fitting the available 48 experimental data points to the 2d loess model the steady state cell density could be calculated for any possible combination of n and p resource concentrations using the predict function in base r the estimates for each combination of n and p concentrations were generated into a matrix and visualized through contour plots to show a smoothing relationship between the resource stoichiometry and phytoplankton biomass fig 3 a c each value of the phytoplankton density on the 2d loess contours was estimated according to pre defined n p locations https stat ethz ch pipermail r help 2007 february 125269 html accessed on 1st december 2021 the phytoplankton density at the intermediate nsls 0 74 1 94 was calculated with an interval of 0 12 based on the estimates from the 2d loess contours for each nsl the cell density of each supply n p ratio was extracted at an interval of less than 0 01 generating smoothing curves that described the relationships between the supply n p ratio and phytoplankton density fig s6 we sorted through all phytoplankton density estimates with different supply n p ratios and extracted the maximum value whose n p ratio was regarded as the most optimal for that nsl fig 3d f the analytical process for determining the optimal supply n p ratios of different nutrient levels using 2d loess is shown in fig s7 2 6 literature dataset analyses published datasets from previous studies were compared with the results of the present study datasets were selected based on the four following criteria 1 phytoplankton monocultures were cultivated under conditions with different absolute and relative n and p concentrations 2 the combinations of the supply n and p concentrations were sufficient for calculating the optimal n p ratios for at least two nsls 3 the cultures were cultivated through the steady state phase and the steady state biomass was determined and 4 n and p were the only limiting factors for phytoplankton growth during cultivation although studies have focused on the influence of supply n p ratios on phytoplankton growth the majority of the obtained datasets did not cover two or more nsls nevertheless datasets derived from frank et al 2020 and kunikane et al 1984 fulfilled the aforementioned criteria for frank et al 2020 we applied the 2d loess method described above to determine the effects of the nsl on the optimal supply n p ratios during the steady state for the same four phytoplankton species in monoculture ankistrodesmus sp chlamydomonas reinhardtii scenedesmus obliquus and staurastrum sp fig 4 a d and in admixture fig 4e optimal supply n p ratios at the nsls from 1 7 to 4 7 were estimated with an interval of 0 1 and only the nsls resulting in a unimodal curve with a peak the curve describes the relationship between steady state phytoplankton biomass and the supply n p ratios fig s7 were applied to assess the impacts of the nsl on the optimal supply n p ratio figs 4f j s7 in kunikane et al 1984 higher dilution rates led to higher available n and p concentrations in the medium during the steady state phase which was equivalent to the high nsls used in the present study we calculated the transitions between n and p requirements using smoothing spline curves in graphpad prism graphpad san diego ca usa fig 4k and l the dataset in frank et al 2020 was directly obtained from the authors whereas the data presented in fig 4 of kunikane et al 1984 was estimated using the open access digitizing software engauge digitizer version 12 1 because we were unable to contact the authors 3 results for most of the nsls of the three phytoplankton species the steady state phytoplankton density followed a significant unimodal relationship with the supply n p ratio with the exceptions of c vulgaris and a variabilis cultures at the nsl of 1 91 fig 2 the optimal ratios estimated using 1d loess generally decreased with an increased nsl fig 2 2d loess predictions of the relationships between the supply n p ratio and the nsl were obtained from all 48 experimental units rather than only the experimental units having the same nsl fig 3a c and this method generated more detailed relationships between the optimal supply n p ratio and the nsl the results of the 2d loess models showed the same pattern as the 1d loess the optimal supply n p ratio decreased with the increase in nsl for all three studied phytoplankton species fig 3d f the datasets obtained from the literature also supported this trend three of the four phytoplankton species studied by frank et al 2020 were found to have a decrease in the optimal supply n p ratio with an increasing nsl fig 4f i c reinhardtii was the only exception as its optimal supply n p ratios were distributed in a narrow range mean sd 23 9 1 2 fig 4i in addition the results of the mixed culture in frank et al 2020 showed a similar trend of a decreasing optimal supply n p ratio with nsls fig 4j the calculated results of the data from kunikane et al 1984 indicated that the optimal n p ratios of s dimorphus decreased with the increase in dilution rate fig 4l at the steady state observed in the chemostat the growth rate of the phytoplankton density was equal to the dilution rate in other words phytoplankton with high growth rates tended to require more p than n overall seven out of the eight analyzed phytoplankton species exhibited a decreasing optimal supply n p ratio with the increase in nutrient availability this trend was achieved under different culture conditions i e semi continuous culture in the present study batch cultures in frank et al 2020 and chemostat cultures in kunikane et al 1984 and methods for regulating the absolute nutrient concentrations i e varying input nutrients in the present study and frank et al 2020 varying dilution rates in kunikane et al 1984 although the optimal supply n p ratio generally decreased with the increase in nsl the downward trend was not immutable especially for high nsls the decline tended to level off at high nsls or high dilution rates in the chemostat experiment which was observed in half of the studied species c vulgaris and m aeruginosa cultures in the present experiments fig 3 s obliquus staurastrum sp and mixed cultures in frank et al 2020 and s dimorphus in kunikane et al 1984 fig 4 4 discussion n and p requirements for phytoplankton growth seem to be flexible among various trophic statuses as reflected by the decrease of the optimal supply n p ratio with the increase in nsl the optimal supply n p ratio was defined as the supply n p ratio in a medium where the transition from n limitation to p limitation for phytoplankton growth occurred we found only one exception c reinhardtii among the eight studied species fig 4d and i while stable ranges of the optimal supply n p ratio were observed in half of the other phytoplankton cultures at high nsls therefore we cannot identify whether the optimal supply n p ratio for c reinhardtii was truly stable over all nsls or whether the nsls studied by frank et al 2020 were too high to cover the decreasing ranges of the optimal supply n p ratio despite this exception a significant proportion of the phytoplankton species supported the conclusion that phytoplankton has higher n requirements than p requirements at low nsls or vice versa at high nsls although we focused mainly on monocultures in the present study it is noteworthy that the mixed cultures studied in frank et al 2020 produced similar results that support our hypothesis fig 4j the trend of decreasing optimal supply n p ratio with nsls was unaffected by species shifts within the mixed cultures all four species in the mixed cultures belonged to a single phylum chlorophyta however we have not yet determined whether our hypothesis is also applicable to mixed cultures comprising various taxa to the best of our knowledge this study is the first to demonstrate that trophic status is negatively related to the relative n p requirement for phytoplankton growth changes in the optimal n p ratio at different nsls could be explained by the growth rate hypothesis which states that the variation in cellular n p ratios is largely attributed to cellular protein and rrna contents elser et al 2000 sterner and elser 2002 as proteins are the largest cellular n pool and rrnas are the largest contributor of p to phytoplankton cells geider and la roche 2002 sterner and elser 2002 for phytoplankton cultures under the same supply n p ratio but at different nsls higher nsls or high dilution rates in the chemostat experiment likely increased nutrient availability and promoted phytoplankton growth resulting in higher biomass fig 2 4 phytoplankton growth enhancement would increase the rrna requirement resulting in a higher requirement of p relative to n it is also possible that the changes in the optimal n p ratios were related to certain adaptive responses of phytoplankton to low nutrient supplies in low p environments phytoplankton would selectively increase the synthesis of p free compounds rather than p containing compounds to reduce the p demand such as by replacing phospholipids in cell membranes with sulfonated lipids snyder et al 2009 wurch et al 2011 however n seems to be more essential for phytoplankton photosynthesis than p n limitation in phytoplankton can cause a substantial decline in the content of the major photosynthetic pigment chlorophyll a and increase the amount of non photosynthetic pigments herrig and falkowski 1989 geider et al 1993 however the effects of p limitation on cellular chlorophyll a are relatively smaller than those of n limitation geider et al 1998 in addition n limitation may greatly reduce the efficiency of photosystem ii and the relative abundance of rubisco in phytoplankton cells falkowski et al 1989 geider et al 1993 whereas p limitation moderately affects phytoplankton photosystems geider et al 1998 accordingly we assumed that phytoplankton may have a steady n requirement because of its importance for photosynthesis while the p requirement may be more flexible via adaptation and acclimation responses this assumption is consistent with the results of galbraith and martiny 2015 who found that the cellular abundance of n in phytoplankton tends to be less plastic than the p content phytoplankton under dual n and p limitation therefore would show a higher requirement for n than p the decreasing curve of the optimal n p ratio tended to level off with increasing nsl as observed in half of the studied phytoplankton species figs 3 and 4 for datasets derived from experiments with a factorial design the present study and frank et al 2020 high nsls were only studied with limited experimental units and the supply n p ratios of these units were distributed in a narrow range as shown in fig 2 the peaks of the unimodal curves became indistinct at high nsls and the optimal supply n p ratios for c vulgaris and a variabilis at the nsl of 1 91 molar supply n p ratios distributed from 7 71 to 33 29 could not be identified using the 1d loess method hence the disappearance of the decreasing trend may be partly explained by the factorial design used in the present study and by frank et al 2020 the data of kunikane et al 1984 showed similar results as the optimal n p ratio became stable at high absolute nsls fig 4l however this trend could not be explained by the same reason because nsls were regulated by dilution rates instead of nutrient input thus stable optimal n p ratios at high nsls may not be a coincidence stable optimal n p ratios at high nsls may result from the decrease in nutrient affinity alongside the increase in absolute nutrient concentrations smith et al 2009 bonachela et al 2011 phytoplankton cells can increase the number of surface uptake sites proteins that incorporate nutrients from the cell membrane into the cytoplasm to increase the encounter with nutrients in low nutrient waterbodies smith et al 2009 bonachela et al 2011 leading to a high nutrient affinity for phytoplankton cells with the increase in nutrient availability phytoplankton growth is no longer limited by extracellular nutrients and the nutrient uptake rates are thus controlled by intracellular enzymes that assimilate the encountered nutrients smith et al 2009 therefore we can find explicitly decreasing curves of optimal n p ratios under low nsls due to the high nutrient affinity in this phase and the curves become stable at high nsls because of the decrease in nutrient affinity fig 5 for high nsls the optimal supply n p ratios can be calculated using the 2d loess method fig 3 but cannot always be estimated using the 1d loess method fig 2 the optimal n p ratios at high nsls derived from the 2d loess method were calculated using experimental units of both high nsls and low nsls the values calculated on the smoothing curves of high nsls could be regarded as an inertial extension of values estimated at low nsls thus although the optimal n p ratios at high nsls could be calculated mathematically the ecological significance of the calculated n p ratios would be negligible fig 5 another possible reason for the indistinction of the optimal supply n p ratios at high trophic levels could be the low light intensity 15 µmol photons m2 s 1 used in the present study at high nsls low light intensity is more likely to be the main limiting factor for phytoplankton growth compared to n and p thus the limiting effects of low light intensity may mask the effects of n and p and ultimately lead to the indistinction of the optimal supply n p ratios the cyanobacterium a variabilis is capable of nitrogen fixation thiel et al 2014 which is thought to have the potential to offset the decline in the resource n supply the results indicate that the optimal supply n p ratios for a variabilis cultures at low nsls are much higher than those at high nsls figs 2b and 3d in other words nitrogen fixation in a variabilis cells did not offset the decline in the n supply which supports the idea that although nitrogen fixation could stimulate cyanobacterial growth cyanobacterial n fixers do not fully compensate for n deficiency lewis and wurtsbaugh 2008 scott and mccarthy 2010 experimental setups and culture systems varied between this experiment and those of previous studies from which datasets were used in the present study kunikane et al 1984 frank et al 2020 nsls calculated from batch cultures in frank et al 2020 were almost 2 5 fold higher than nsls calculated using data derived from the present semi continuous cultures in the present study figs 3 and 4 because the initial nutrient level of the batch cultures was higher than that of the semi continuous cultures additionally both values and changing ranges of optimal supply n p ratios calculated from the present semi continuous cultures were lower and narrower than those in previous studies kunikane et al 1984 frank et al 2020 which could be attributed to the differences in experimental setups and phytoplankton taxa among the experiments additionally the light intensity applied in frank et al 2020 40 45 15 00 µmol photons m2 s 1 was much higher than that in our study 15 µmol photons m2 s 1 which could explain the broader optimal supply n p ratio ranges in frank et al 2020 5 conclusions the response curves depicting the relationships between the optimal supply n p ratio and trophic status varied among the eight tested phytoplankton species but seven of them showed similar declining trends our results support the idea that the transition from n requirements to p requirements is not a definite boundary but it varies depending on trophic status with lower nutrient supplies leading to higher n requirements than p requirements fig 5 the n vs p limitation for controlling phytoplankton growth has been discussed for decades but it still remains an open question schindler et al 2008 conley et al 2009 xu et al 2010 paerl et al 2016 the present study assumed that neither n nor p was superior in controlling phytoplankton growth p was considered to have high priority in conditions with sufficient n and p supplies i e phytoplankton blooms in eutrophic waterbodies which is consistent with studies showing that p is more effective in controlling eutrophication than n carpenter 2008 schindler et al 2008 in contrast we suggest that the importance of n to phytoplankton productivity is greater in environments with a low nutrient supply i e in oligotrophic waterbodies overall our results could be useful for the control of phytoplankton biomass and

15643,herein we report the significant effects of natural organic matter contained in natural zeolite z nom on the physicochemical characteristics of a ni fe natural zeolite nf nz catalyst and its decontamination performance toward the dechlorination of trichloroethylene tce z nom predominantly consists of humic like substances and has demonstrable utility in the synthesis of bimetallic catalysts compared to nf nz600c devoid of z nom nf nz had increased dispersibility and mobility and showed significant enhancement in the catalytic dechlorination of tce owing to the encapsulation of ni0 fe0 nanoparticles by z nom the results of corrosion experiments spectroscopic analyses and h2 production experiments confirmed that ni0 acted as an efficient cocatalyst with fe0 to enhance the dechlorination of tce to ethane and z nom capped ni0 showed improved adsorption of tce and atomic hydrogen on their reactive sites and oxidation resistance the density functional theory dft studies have substantiated the improved adsorption of tce due to the presence of nom especially by cooh structure and the enhanced charge density at the ni site in the ni fe bimetal alloy for the stronger adsorption of hydrogen atoms that ultimately enhanced the tce reduction reaction these findings illustrate the efficiency of nom containing natural minerals toward the synthesis of bimetallic catalysts for practical applications graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords natural zeolite mineral induced nom ni fe bimetallic catalysts catalytic dechlorination trichloroethylene dft computational studies bader charge analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction chlorinated volatile organic carbons cvocs used in various industries emerged as global contaminants due to their involuntary release into soil air and water bodies huang et al 2014 several physicochemical methods have been employed to treat these cvocs dai et al 2018 nanosized zerovalent iron nzvi fe0 has been widely applied for the in situ treatment of sites contaminated with cvocs owing to its ease of use low cost and eco friendly characteristics lhotský et al 2021 mdlovu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 2022 however rapid aggregation and corrosion of nzvi leads to technical difficulties for application in soil and groundwater remediation ahmed et al 2017 bae et al 2018 han et al 2018 x yang et al 2021 several approaches have been adopted to address these issues such as the synthesis of nzvi based bimetal nanoparticles li et al 2017 w yang et al 2021 immobilization of nzvi on porous support materials li et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 and coating nzvi surfaces with polymers eljamal et al 2020 tian et al 2020 in the bimetallic system nzvi acts as an electron donor while the second metal serves for the collection of the evolved hydrogen in addition to accelerating the transformation of h2 to atomic hydrogen thereby enhancing the reduction reactivity of nzvi he et al 2018 for this reason various metals such as pd ni ag pt and cu have been used for the synthesis of nzvi based bimetal catalysts tran et al 2020 venkateshaiah et al 2022 among them ni is a cheap alternative to replace the precious metals as a cocatalyst for dechlorination of chlorinated organic compounds the hydrodechlorination reaction depends on the adsorption capacity of atomic hydrogen and the chlorinated organics on the metal surface compared to other metals ni has relatively high adsorption for atomic hydrogen and chlorinated compounds by forming ni cl bonds kumar et al 2017 ni metal can also be used as an electron transfer medium which can overcome the self inhibition in electron transfer ni fe nano bimetal usually has a higher specific surface area and can have more active sites liu et al 2022 surface modification of nzvi with polymers or surfactants is another approach to improve the colloidal stability of the nanoparticles which leads to improved mobility in subsurface environments kumar et al 2017 zhang et al 2002 the immobilization of nzvi on various supports e g biochar jiang et al 2022 bentonite gopal et al 2020 kaolinite moyo and nkambule 2022 zeolite eljamal et al 2022 reduced graphene oxide kang et al 2022 and activated carbon ndagijimana et al 2022 has been studied recently with the aim of improving the dispersion stability and reactivity in particular natural zeolite nz obtained from the mining industry can be used for large scale applications owing to its renewability low cost and abundant availability moreover its high thermal and chemical stability catalyzing ability and adsorption capacity toward various contaminants underline its significant potential for use as a support material for the practical remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by cvocs kaliya et al 2022 valdés et al 2021 to perform soil and groundwater remediation using nzvi based catalysts their interactions with the target contaminants as well as non contaminants such as natural organic matter nom should be systematically investigated nom omnipresent in subsurface environments han et al 2019 comprise complex alkyl and aromatic organic molecules with hydroxyl carboxylic and quinone functional groups humic fulvic like that can influence the surface charge and reactivity of the samples louie et al 2016 świetlik et al 2004 indeed many researchers have reported the detrimental effect of nom on the removal efficiency of pollutants by different types of fe based materials han et al 2019 yi et al 2019 some studies have also revealed that nom interactions can influence the stability mobility and reactivity of nzvi and bentonite supported ni fe catalysts ratpukdi et al 2021 wang et al 2016 previous studies have demonstrated the effect of aqueous nom on the catalytic reactions of nzvi based catalysts however the effect of the nom already existing in the starting material itself on the natural mineral surface has not been investigated because natural minerals obtained from soil environments can potentially contain a high content of nom fox et al 2017 their use as a support material for the synthesis of reactive catalysts can significantly influence the various characteristics of the catalysts hui et al 2021 moreover no comparative computational studies on the adsorption of tce and hydrogen on the ni fe nanoparticle surface in absence and presence of nom functional groups cooh or oh etc have been reported structures of chemically adsorbed tce on metallic iron zhang et al 2008 activated adsorption of a hydrophobic organic contaminant in mineral micropores farrell et al 2002 tce hydrodehalogenation mechanism on pd 111 surface kausamo et al 2014 surfaces of ni fe bimetals he et al 2015 singh et al 2011 were studied because of insufficient existing reports and to support the experimental findings study on tce and hydrogen adsorption energetics in presence of nom on the ni fe surface is necessary in this study we used a naturally occurring zeolite that inherently contains nom z nom to examine the effect of z nom on the synthesis of bimetallic catalysts suitable for decontamination processes specifically we investigated the effect of z nom on the physicochemical properties of bimetallic catalysts and evaluated their catalytic performance dispersion mobility and air stability ni fe nzvi bimetallic catalyst supported by z nom containing natural zeolite nf nz was synthesized and applied for the catalytic dechlorination of tce a recalcitrant for human health de miranda and greenamyre 2020 vlaanderen et al 2013 then by using density functional theory dft calculations chemisorption of tce and atomic hydrogen on ni fe bimetal catalyst surfaces in presence and absence of natural organic matter were studied at the molecular electronic level politzer et al 1993 wimmer 1996 the main objectives of this study were to i characterize the z nom and develop catalyst i e nf nz ii investigate the influence of z nom on the characteristics of nf nz iii evaluate the catalytic performance transport in the sand column and air stability of nf nz compared to nf nz devoid of z nom i e nf nz600c iv study the adsorption behaviors of tce and atomic hydrogen on the ni fe surface by dft in presence of nom and v identify the enhanced dechlorination mechanism of tce by nf nz on the basis of experimental and computational results 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals and materials z nom containing nz was purchased from a mining site in youngil kyungpook south korea trichloroethylene tce iron

were purchased from daejung chemicals south korea unless stated otherwise all the experiments were conducted using deaerated deionized water ddiw which was prepared by purging diw with ar gas for 4 h 2 2 synthesis of nf nz and other control materials nf nz was synthesized by the sodium borohydride activation method using iron chloride and nickel chloride salts first 1 g of nz support was dispersed in ddiw and sonicated for 10 min a solution prepared by dissolving 0 242 g of fecl3 6h2o in 10 ml of ddiw was added dropwise to the nz suspension and stirred for 1 h subsequently 40 ml of 1 m nabh4 solution was added dropwise under vigorous stirring for 30 min finally a solution of 0 02 g of nicl2 6h2o in 10 ml ddiw was added dropwise and the stirring was continued for another 30 min the solid product was collected via filtration washed with ethanol and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 οc for 6 h the prepared sample which contains 0 5 wt ni and 5 wt fe is denoted as nf nz similarly the control samples with 5 wt fe 5 wt was used as a reference and 0 25 1 and 2 wt ni were prepared and labelled as nf nz0 25 nf nz1 0 and nf nz2 0 respectively bare samples of nzvi 10 wt ni doped nzvi nf considering the ni fe ratio of 1 10 in nf nz 5 wt fe supported on nz f nz and 0 5 wt ni supported on nz n nz were also prepared for comparison to investigate the effect of the support ni fe bimetallic catalysts supported by elvan sericite and feldspar were prepared by the method described above and labeled as nf elvan nf sericite and nf feldspar respectively to examine the effect of z nom on the reactivity mobility and air stability of nf nz we prepared a z nom removed nz sample by calcination of nz at 600 οc for 4 h nz600c under aerobic conditions nz600c was used as the support to prepare the control sample which consisted of 0 5 wt ni and 5 wt fe supported on nz nf nz600c 2 3 dechlorination of tce the degradation of tce was conducted via batch experiments using the synthesized catalysts first a fresh tce stock solution 50 mm was prepared in methanol and used for the tce degradation experiments glass serum bottles 27 ml with rubber septa and aluminum capping were used as the batch reactors all the samples used for the tce experiments were prepared in an anaerobic chamber coy lab product approximately 20 mg of the catalyst and 19 96 ml of ddiw were introduced into the serum bottle thereafter 40 μl of the tce stock solution was injected into the prepared suspension to initiate the dechlorination reaction of 0 1 mm tce the bottles were immediately capped with rubber septa sealed with aluminum caps and removed from the anaerobic chamber the bottles were shaken well to disperse the catalyst and mounted on an orbital mixer 10 rpm kept at room temperature 25 0 5 c at each interval two bottles duplicate samples were sacrificed for headspace gas sampling using an airtight micro syringe 2 4 characterization of catalysts the physical and chemical characteristics of the synthesized catalysts were investigated using various surface analyses such as thermogravimetric analysis tga n 1000 scinco korea x ray fluorescence xrf panalytical epsilon 3 xl germany

samples collected at different intervals were subjected to icp mass spectrometry icp ms perkinelmer usa the details of the sample preparation for each analysis are provided in the supporting

instruments equipped with a capillary column rtx 1301 w integra guard 30 m 0 535 mm restek usa at each sampling 100 μl of the gas sample was collected from the headspace of the sacrificed batch reactor the characteristics of the nom present in the nz were analyzed using fluorescence and uv a absorption spectroscopy table s1 electrochemical analysis was performed using an sp 150 electrochemical workstation biologic france sedimentation and mobility tests were performed using a quartz cuvette and column reactor respectively the details of the sample preparation and tce measurements z nom analysis sedimentation and mobility tests and electrochemical analysis are provided in the supporting information 2 6 computational studies the details of the computational studies are provided in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of z nom and its embedment in nf nz catalyst fig s1 a and b shows the effect of z nom table s1 during the synthesis of nf nz and nf nz600c by the addition of nabh4 respectively after adding nabh4 and the fe and ni precursor solutions to the nz suspension a color change from yellow to black was observed due to the reduction of fe iii to fe 0 with the occurrence of foam fig s1 a while case of nf nz600c did not show any generation of foam during the synthesis procedure fig s1 b in general surfactants such as sodium or potassium salts of long chain hydrocarbons can act as foaming agents that reduce the surface tension of water denkov et al 2009 since the ph of the nabh4 solution was close to 10 it was postulated that the nom containing nz might act as a natural surfactant because the z nom in clay minerals and zeolites can be extracted in solutions at high ph araujo et al 2014 to identify the nature of the z nom we first extracted it using a 0 3 m naoh solution fox et al 2017 schnitzer and schuppli 1989 and analyzed its molecular weight mw distributions using high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec and fluorescence spectroscopy fig 1 a c z nom consists of either aromatic or aliphatic organic materials such as humic like substances and biomolecules hence its physicochemical properties i e aromaticity and elemental composition mw and functional group composition vary considerably depending on the origin of the nom the aromatic counterpart of z nom consisted solely of a low mw fraction the highest uva response of z nom corresponded to 1 590 da fig 1 a which is indicative of humic like substances 4000 da huber et al 2011 similarly a relatively strong fluorescence peak was detected for the protein like components of z nom in the nz mw 1 070 da fig 1 b however despite the much higher sensitivity the uva response of z nom maximum intensity 8120 mv was slightly higher than its fluorescence response maximum intensity 7120 mv peer reviewed characterizing aquatic dissolved organic matter 2003 this implies that z nom primarily comprises hydrophobic compounds i e humic like substances the high range of the suva value suva 8 0 and the fluorescence peak location of z nom the excitation and emission wavelengths were 290 and 470 nm respectively table s1 and fig 1 c further established that humic like substances were the key components of the organic material coated nz chon et al 2013 z nom was further characterized by performing tga of the raw nz and nz600c fig 1 d the first weight loss step below 300 c was attributed to the removal of water molecules physisorbed on the nz aloulou et al 2021 mosai et al 2019 the second weight loss step below 500 c can be ascribed to the dehydroxylation condensation of the silanol groups in the nz aloulou et al 2021 ates and hardacre 2012 the weight loss from 500 to 900 c was attributed to the decomposition or oxidation of carbons i e z nom present in the nz eltaweil et al 2020 the three weight losses described above were clearly observed in the nz sample indicating the presence of z nom however these clear weight losses between 100 and 300 c and 500 900 c were not observed in the nz600c sample instead only a small weight loss between 300 and 500 c was observed because of the presence of a negligible proportion of surface silanol groups in nz600c which were removed by condensation at 600 c the synthesized nf nz and nf nz600c were further subjected to tga fig 1 e both the catalysts exhibited a weight loss below 400 c with a weight gain in the temperature range of 400 500 c this weight gain was due to the oxidation of the ni fe bimetals to their corresponding oxide phases eltaweil et al 2020 habish et al 2017 a weight gain of only 0 6 was observed for nf nz compared to the 1 5 weight gain for nf nz600c this difference was probably due to the inhibitive ni fe oxidation by z nom in nf nz and the strong interactions between the ni fe bimetals and the nz support the weight loss at temperatures exceeding 500 c attributed to the decomposition of z nom was observed to be 0 8 for nf nz as compared to the marginal loss for nf nz600c indicating the existence of z nom in the nf nz sample the tga results indicated that the z nom present in the nf nz catalyst can strongly interact with the ni fe bimetal particles and impede metal oxidation whereas the lack of z nom resulted in more pronounced oxidation of the ni fe bimetals in nf nz600c 3 2 effect of z nom on structure and morphology of nf nz fig 2 a shows the ftir spectra of nf nz nf nz600c and the bare supports i e nz and nz600c in general the bare supports and bimetallic catalysts exhibited similar ftir patterns except for a shoulder peak at 1400 cm 1 in the nf nz sample which was ascribed to the formation of oxidized species on the surfaces of the ni fe bimetals tasharrofi et al 2020 the peaks observed at 1100 and 474 cm 1 are related respectively to the si o tetrahedral bending band and si o si stretching vibration corresponding to silica or quartz coudurier et al 1982 the nf nz sample showed strong o h stretching 3420 cm 1 bending 1645 cm 1 vibrations originating from the adsorbed water in the zeolite pores in addition a strong peak at 3620 cm 1 attributed to hydrogen bonding with the si o si linkage was obtained for the nz and nf nz samples the al oh liberation band at 915 cm 1 and al oh out of plane vibration at 796 cm 1 were prominent for the nz and nf nz samples liu et al 2014 while they were absent for the nz600c and nf nz600c samples indicating the transformation of the al oh groups to al o al linkages frost et al 2003 as observed in the tga profiles the calcination of nz resulted in the loss of surface oh functionality in addition the weak c h vibrations at 2855 and 2930 cm 1 confirmed the presence of organic functionalities i e z nom in the nz and nf nz samples whereas the nz600c and nf nz600c lack these vibrations probably because of the removal of organic moieties i e z nom in the natural zeolite at high temperature calcination the removal of nom at high temperature calcination was also substantiated by the tga profiles discussed in the earlier part fig 1 d and e fig 2 b shows the xrd patterns of the samples nz and nz600c showed similar patterns which confirmed that nz retained its structural stability even after calcination at 600 c furthermore the ni fe bimetal deposition on nz did not result in any significant changes in the xrd patterns of the support material no peaks were observed for the fe or ni metals because of the low detection limit of xrd for elemental analysis 2 and high intensity of silica and alumina related peaks i e quartz and clinoptilolite from nz cheng et al 2017 hamid et al 2020 the xrf results showed a high content of sio2 and al2o3 85 in total in raw nz with 8 fe2o3 and other oxide phases table s2 n2 adsorption desorption experiments were performed to measure the bet surface area pore size and pore volumes of the nf and nf nz samples fig 2 c and d and table s3 typical n2 adsorption desorption curves were obtained for nz and nf nz fig 2 c which showed an h3 hysteresis loop in the range of 0 45 1 0 p p0 according to the iupac classification sing et al 1985 these results may be due to the multilayer adsorption and capillary condensation in the mesopores or in the space between the clinoptilolite crystallites of the natural zeolite favvas et al 2016 the bet surface area and pore volumes of the nz and nf nz samples were found to be 77 13 and 48 07 m2 g and 0 22 and 0 21 cm3 g respectively it is plausible that the blockage of the pores by the ni fe bimetal particles supported on the nz surface was responsible for the reduction in the surface area of nf nz to investigate the morphological characteristics of nf nz we conducted fesem analysis sheet like morphologies were observed for nz and nz600c fig s2 a and b which is typical of clinoptilolite zeolites favvas et al 2016 in contrast a fine distribution of ni fe bimetal nanoparticles over the surface of nz and nz600c was observed in nf nz and nf nz600c fig s2 c and d the magnified sem image of nf nz shows that the spherical bimetal nanoparticles with a particle size of approximately 50 100 nm were well distributed on the surfaces of nz and nz600c the nf nz catalyst was further characterized using fetem fig 3 the tem images clearly revealed the presence of ni fe bimetal nanoparticles which were uniformly distributed on the nz surface interestingly we observed thin and transparent layers at the surface edges and corners of nz red arrows in fig 3 a and b from the magnified fetem image fig 3 c it was confirmed that the ni fe bimetal nanoparticles were capped by carbon matter i e z nom the absence of any lattice patterns in the fetem images confirmed the amorphous nature of the ni fe bimetals lin et al 2010 lin et al observed amorphous nzvi in the presence of polyacrylic acid paa and carboxymethyl cellulose cmc according to their report the reduced amorphous primary iron 1 3 nm particles can be assembled into large spherical secondary iron particles 50 100 nm nzvi observed using fesem and fetem during the reduction by nabh4 owing to the presence of paa cmc and ostwald ripening in addition when the thin layer of z nom was exposed to a high resolution tem beam the z nom surface appeared to be altered the high energy tem beam burned the z nom template and created pores in the structure as observed in fig s3 red circles this z nom template might efficiently shield the bimetal surface from oxidation and improve the dispersion by reducing the magnetic attraction between the nzvi particles ruiz torres et al prepared an improved ethylene glycol functionalized nzvi in an open atmosphere which resulted in enhanced aerobic stability of the nzvi ruiz torres et al 2018 in addition kumar et al stabilized the surface of nzvi nanoparticles using polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp kumar et al 2017 however in the previous studies external additives were added to the nzvi suspensions this is comparable with this study which demonstrates the role of the naturally existing z nom in nz that functions as an in situ stabilizer during the synthesis of the catalyst fig 3 d shows the sei image and fig 3 e j illustrates the eds mapping images of the different elements fe ni c si al and o respectively present in the nf nz sample the uniform and fine distribution of ni on the surface of the fe nanoparticles can be clearly seen in the eds mapping fig 3 e and f indicating that the formation of the nzvi nanoparticles preceded the reduction of ni ions on the nzvi surface 3 3 effect of z nom on mobility and corrosion of nf nz sedimentation and mobility tests were performed to investigate the effect of z nom encapsulation on the mobility of nf nz in the soil system fig s4 a and b for nzvi the magnetic force leads to a strong attraction between the nanoparticles resulting in rapid agglomeration and complete sedimentation in 40 min fig s4 a for nz600c we observed 50 sedimentation in 60 min while the nz suspension showed a higher dispersion 20 sedimentation in 60 min which was probably due to the presence of z nom finally nf nz showed the highest dispersibility while rapid sedimentation occurred in the nf nz600c suspension in the mobility test nf nz600c showed poor mobility in the sand column resulting in only 30 catalyst recovery fig s4 b in contrast 65 of the nf nz was recovered continuously in the sand column indicating that the mobility of nf nz can be significantly improved by z nom encapsulation of the catalyst surface the results indicate that the increased particle density due to the addition of ni and fe and strong magnetic interactions between the nzvi particles supported on nz600c might be responsible for rapid agglomeration and poor dispersion and mobility however these problems are addressed in the z nom encapsulated nf nz in which z nom functions as an organic stabilizer to understand the effect of surface properties on the dispersion and mobility the zeta potentials of the nf nz and nf nz600c samples were measured at ph 3 5 7 9 and 11 fig s4 e the zeta potentials shifted to more negative values as the ph of the solution increased from 3 to 11 in particular the zeta potential values of nf nz were much more negative than those of nf nz600c the higher negative surface characteristics of nf nz might have originated from the surface functional groups carboxylic or phenolic of the z nom the macromolecules comprising the z nom in nf nz interact with the surface either by complexation with carboxylic phenolic or hydroxylic groups or through hydrophobic interactions zhu et al 2014 these macromolecules have low pka values 3 7 for fulvic acid and 4 3 humic acid ritchie and michael perdue 2003 therefore at higher ph free charged groups generate a net negative surface charge on the samples gallego urrea et al 2014 thus the long chains of z nom can create steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion between the nf nz particles and inhibit the interaction of the nf nz particles with the silica sand particles resulting in enhanced dispersion and mobility the particle sizes of the nf nz catalyst in aqueous dispersions were also studied by the dls analysis fig s4 f wherein the nf nz showed uniform particle sizes after 1 h of dispersion time confirming its superior dispersibility one of the major problems hindering the practical application of nzvi is the rapid surface passivation by atmospheric oxygen during long term storage bae et al 2018 to evaluate the corrosion behaviors of nzvi nf nf nz and nf nz600c we monitored the tafel plots of each sample fig 4 b polarized in the potential range from 0 6 to 0 v in aqueous aerobic conditions at neutral ph 0 05 m na2so4 fig 4 a the nzvi exhibited a strong polarization behavior with a negative corrosion potential of 0 406 v and a corrosion current of 0 778 μa table s4 however the ni fe bimetallic nanoparticles i e nf showed a reduction in the negative corrosion potential 0 397 v with a lower corrosion current of 0 641 μa indicating that the corrosion of nzvi was slightly decreased by the addition of ni interestingly nf nz600c showed the highest negative corrosion potential 0 438 v and positive corrosion current 0 860 μa whereas nf nz showed the lowest negative potential 0 365 v and positive corrosion current 0 399 μa this result indicates that the presence of ni and z nom in nf nz decreases the corrosion of the ni fe bimetals and improves their resistance to oxidation a similar observation was reported by greenlee et al wherein the ni shell and cmc stabilized the nzvi surface from oxidation in an o2 rich aqueous solution greenlee et al 2012 the absence of z nom in the structure of nf nz600c resulted in the direct exposure of the nzvi surface to the oxidizing agents whereas for the nf nz sample the nzvi surface was capped by the hydrophobic z nom which prevented the oxidizing agents from reaching the nzvi surface ratpukdi et al 2021 xps analyses of fresh and air exposed for 15 d nf nz and nf nz600c were conducted to validate the enhanced air resistance and stability a typical fe 2p3 2 spectrum of the nf nz sample fresh and air exposed is shown in fig 5 a the fe 2p3 2 peak was deconvoluted into three peaks with binding energies of 706 7 709 9 and 712 6 ev corresponding to fe0 fe2 and fe3 respectively he et al 2018 kumar et al 2017 the ratio of fe0 to fe2 fe3 was calculated to be approximately 0 14 and 0 11 for the fresh and air exposed for 15 d samples respectively similarly the ni 2p3 2 spectrum was deconvoluted into two peaks with binding energies of 852 5 and 855 6 ev corresponding to the ni0 and ni2 states respectively fig 5 c kumar et al 2017 the ni0 to ni2 ratio was calculated to be 0 30 and 0 28 the surface proportions of the fe0 and ni0 species were marginally lower for the 15 d air exposed sample compared to those of the fresh nf nz sample the ratio of fe0 to fe2 fe3 was found to be approximately 0 16 and 0 08 for the fresh and 15 d air exposed samples of nf nz600c respectively fig 5 b the ni0 to ni2 ratio was calculated to be 0 15 and 0 12 for the fresh and air exposed samples respectively fig 5 d overall the percentage of fe0 on the surface of the nf nz600c sample declined to 50 compared to that on the nf nz sample 20 the ni0 to ni2 ratio of the nf nz and nf nz600c samples was almost stable after 15 d of air exposure the fast oxidation of fe0 might be due to its strong reduction potential 0 4 v compared to that of zerovalent nickel 0 25 v in the case of the nf nz sample the presence of z nom led to the slower aerial oxidation of fe0 than that of the nf nz600c sample in which the fe0 of nf nz600c was directly exposed to air moreover the surface ni0 content in the nf nz sample was almost twice that of the nf nz600c sample these results indicate that z nom encapsulation of the nf nz catalyst improved its air stability the nature of z nom was further analyzed using the c 1s xps spectra of nf nz fig 5 e the c 1s peak is deconvoluted into various peaks with binding energies of 284 0 284 8 285 7 286 3 287 4 and 288 7 ev araujo et al 2014 the peak at 284 8 ev can be attributed to adventitious carbon the peak at 284 ev represents the c c bonds in the z nom structure and the peak at 285 7 ev can be indexed to the hydroxyl or phenolic groups the binding energy of 286 3 ev corresponds to the sp3 carbon bonded to the o atom related to the epoxide or ether functionality the other two peaks at 287 4 and 288 7 ev can be attributed to the carbonyl and carboxyl functionalities in z nom analysis of the c 1s functional group of the nf nz sample indicated the presence of humic like substances as observed in the 3d feem with many oh and cooh functional groups as observed in the ftir which can host the iron ions during activation by nabh4 and may form a capping layer on the surface of the fe0 nuclei similar peaks were observed for the used nf nz sample fig 5 f indicating a strong interaction between the z nom and ni fe bimetals supported on nz 3 4 effect of z nom on catalytic dechlorination of tce and longevity of reactivity fig 6 illustrates the catalytic dechlorination kinetics of tce by nf nz and its controls no significant adsorption of tce was observed in the blank and nz alone fig 6 a indicating a negligible loss of tce through contact with the wall of the batch reactor and nz itself the bare nzvi showed almost 10 tce degradation after 12 h of reaction during the reaction we observed that nzvi tended to rapidly aggregate because of the strong magnetic attraction resulting in poor mass transfer of the tce molecules to the reaction sites of nzvi approximately 32 of the tce was degraded after 12 h of reaction in presence of the nf bimetallic catalyst which confirms that the dechlorination of tce was enhanced by ni addition kumar et al 2017 compared to nzvi alone the nzvi supported on nz i e f nz exhibited no significant degradation of tce while the ni supported on nz n nz showed 30 degradation in 6 h these results indicate that the addition of a small fraction of ni 0 5 wt played a more significant role in the reductive degradation of tce than the addition of a larger proportion of fe 5 wt finally the substantial role of ni was established by the activity of nf nz which showed a complete degradation of tce in 90 min fig s5 a to further examine the role of ni the tce degradation was studied by varying the ni fraction from 0 25 to 2 wt at a fixed fe content 5 wt fig 6 b the tce degradation rate increased with the increase in ni content and the kinetic rate constants obtained by fitting the data to the pseudo first order model also showed a continuous increase in their values from 0 022 0 25 wt 0 043 0 5 wt and 0 089 1 0 wt to 0 129 min 1 2 0 wt which confirmed the crucial role of ni in the tce degradation however the lower activity of n nz for tce dechlorination probably because of its lower reduction potential to produce atomic hydrogen as compared to the nzvi hence despite having good adsorption capacity for atomic hydrogen and tce its inactiveness to produce large amounts of atomic hydrogen resulted in poor activity for n nz catalyst nevertheless ni has vital role in enhancing the activity of nf nz iron due to the high reduction potential can produce large number of hydrogen atoms in the solution however most of them are not involved in the dechlorination reaction in fact produce unreactive hydrogen gas in the fe ni bimetal catalyst the ni plays vital role in adsorbing these reactive hydrogen atoms and transferring them to the preadsorbed tce molecules to promote the dechlorination reaction kumar et al 2017 nickel metal can also serve as an electron transfer medium which can overcome the self inhibition in electron transfer liu et al 2022 the impact of z nom on the catalytic performance of nf nz was investigated by conducting tce degradation experiments using nf nz600c fig 6 c according to these results nf nz600c exhibited a delayed removal of tce at 300 min fig s5 b and the kinetic rate constant was 3 5 times lower than that observed for the degradation performed using nf nz 0 012 min 1 therefore the results confirmed that z nom significantly enhanced the catalytic degradation of tce to understand the effect of the support the nf nz sample was compared with other ni fe bimetal modified supports containing si al such as elvan feldspar and sericite among all these catalysts nf nz showed the highest catalytic activity fig 6 d the sedimentation and mobility profiles of nf elvan nf feldspar and nf sericite fig s4 c and d also revealed poor dispersibility and mobility compared to the nf nz sample since silica is hydrophilic in nature hydrophilic samples tend to show lower mobility due to the strong hydrophilic interactions this might be responsible for the low mobility of the nf feldspar nf sericite and nf elvan samples which do not contain mineral induced z nom johnson et al reported that the addition of nom to nzvi suspensions causes the sorption of nom on nzvi resulting in a reduced stacking coefficient which might be responsible for improved mobility johnson et al 2009 however this study was done by additional injection of nom not from the support material likely in this study fig 6 e and f show the formation of byproducts during tce dechlorination by nf nz and nf nz600c respectively we observed the formation of ethane a major product and ethylene as a byproduct during the dechlorination of tce by the nf nz and nf nz600c fig s6 whereas the β elimination byproducts such as di chlorinated acetylenes mono chlorinated acetylene trans dichloroethylene cis dichloroethylene 1 1 dichloroethylene and vinyl chloride were not detected despite using a gc column i e rtx 1301 capable of detecting these byproducts these results may be due to the insufficient detection limit of the gc system or the loss of chlorinated or non chlorinated byproducts during the sampling and injection procedures which led to 20 loss of carbon mass balance fig 6 e and f further a slight variation in the ph was observed for the nf nz and nf nz600c catalysts before and after reaction fig s7 probably due to the release of hcl into the solution which further confirms the dechlorination of tce by the as synthesized catalysts brovelli et al 2012 cao et al 2020 liu et al 2007 the change in the ph was negligible for nzvi maybe because of its poor reactivity for dechlorination of tce to check the effect of ph change on the dissolution of fe ni bimetals supported on nz and nz600c the fe and ni concentrations in the solution were analyzed after the tce degradation reaction the nf nz and nf nz600c did not show dissolution of fe or ni in 2 h however showed ni concentration of 2 14 and 4 414 ppb respectively after 6h reaction time to examine the air stability of nf nz we prepared air aged samples 5 10 and 30 d of nf nz and nf nz600c and used them for tce dechlorination fig 7 a and b in general the degradation efficiency of tce decreased continuously with the increase in the air aging time for nf nz the rate constant decreased from 0 043 to 0 027 min 1 after 30 d of air exposure fig 7 c whereas that for nf nz600c decreased significantly from 0 0125 to 0 005 min 1 fig 7 d nf nz lost only 35 of its initial activity after 30 d of air exposure compared to the 60 loss for nf nz600c the poor stability of nf nz600c can be attributed to the oxidation of the reactive ni fe bimetals to passive inactive oxides the ultimate amount of reactive ni0 fe0 retained on the surface after the synthesis and drying of the samples is a crucial factor based on the xps results the fe0 and ni0 contents of nf nz were 14 and 30 respectively whereas the corresponding contents of nf nz600c were 16 and 15 this indicates that both the catalysts had similar fe0 contents however the ni0 content in nf nz was almost twice as high as that of nf nz600c the effect of the high ni0 content in nf nz will be further discussed in the next section 3 5 effect of z nom on catalytic mechanism to investigate the effect of z nom on the mechanism underlying the dechlorination of tce by nf nz we measured the h2 production in the suspensions of nf nz and nf nz600c in the presence and absence of tce fig s8 a much higher h2 production was observed in the nf nz suspension during the 180 min reaction than in nf nz600c in the absence of tce fig s8 a whereas lower yet highly similar h2 production rates were observed for both the suspensions in the presence of tce fig s8 b the h2 consumption of nf nz600c was approximately 60 fig s8 c with an overall h2 consumption of 2 9 μmol fig s8 d after 1 h of reaction with tce which was approximately 2 7 times lower than that of the nf nz sample 8 01 μmol the lower h2 production by nf nz600c might be due to the strong magnetic interactions leading to the aggregation of the loosely supported ni fe bimetals on the nz600c support after 1 h of reaction fig s9 b while nf nz showed almost negligible aggregation fig s9 a the strong aggregation can reduce the number of surface active catalytic centers resulting in poor h2 production despite the strong negative corrosion potential of nf nz600c table s4 in contrast the prevention of aggregation by z nom led to the presence of more surface active catalytic centers in the nf nz catalyst despite the low corrosion potential resulting in enhanced tce dechlorination through improved production and consumption of h2 notably ethylene was observed as a byproduct in the initial stage of tce dechlorination and disappeared after 90 min of reaction time in the nf nz suspension fig 6 e while nf nz600c showed a continuous retention of ethylene during the tce dechlorination fig 6 f the lack of requisite h2 might be responsible for the incomplete hydrogenation of ethylene to ethane by nf nz600c whereas the higher h2 consumption rate of nf nz propelled the hydrogenation reaction to rapidly produce ethane as the final product to investigate the role of ni in the enhanced dechlorination reaction h2 production experiments were performed in the presence and absence of 0 1 mm tce using nzvi nf f nz and nf nz fig 8 the h2 production by nzvi in the presence 0 35 μmol and absence 0 45 μmol of tce was very poor fig 8 a and b and only 22 of h2 corresponding to 0 1 μmol was consumed by the nzvi after 60 min of reaction we also observed 2 85 and 2 33 μmol of h2 production after 60 min of reaction in the absence and presence of tce respectively in the f nz suspension which indicated that the percentage of h2 consumption was low 18 despite the increased rate of h2 production by f nz for the ni fe bimetal catalyst the h2 production in the absence and presence of tce was observed to be 1 64 and 0 67 μmol respectively fig 8 d the nf catalyst consumed 0 97 μmol h2 which corresponded to an overall h2 yield of 60 indicating that the addition of ni to the nzvi improved the rate of h2 consumption from 22 to 60 fig 8 c however the nf sample exhibited a low retention of activity due to rapid agglomeration caused by the strong magnetic attractions in contrast nf nz exhibited remarkable production and consumption rates of h2 underlining the benefits of a support material and the impact of z nom on the efficient production and consumption of h2 3 6 dft investigation of the tce dechlorination on nf nz catalyst surface the dft results provide a better understanding at the atomic level interaction of nom ba and ph with the ni fe surface and the dehalogenation ability of tce in presence of nom these dft understandings at the atomistic level can thus provide an additional insight to the experimental findings 3 6 1 hydrogen and tce adsorption on pristine fe3ni 111 various hydrogen adsorption sites on the fe3ni 111 4 4 surface were considered such as ni top fe top bridge site hollow ni site and hollow fe site fig s10 the adsorption energy at various hydrogen adsorption sites ranges from 2 40 to 3 11 ev fig s11 among the observed sites the hollow ni site surrounded by two fe and one ni atoms shows the most stable adsorption of 3 11 ev this result supports the hypothesis that ni atoms on the fe3ni surface serve as a key role in preferable adsorption of tce and hydrogen in addition excess bader charge analysis upon the adsorption on the hollow ni site exhibits that the electron charges were transferred from the surface to the adsorbed h atom fig s10 fe1 0 09e and fe2 0 07e ni 0 11e and h 0 31e tce was adsorbed on five different sites on the fe3ni 111 6 6 surface and the adsorption energy ranges from 1 03 to 1 29 ev in fig s12 among the sites site 1 where the c c bond of tce is adsorbed on the top of ni preferably shows the most stable adsorption energy of 1 29 ev fig 9 a the adsorbed configuration of tce deviate significantly from the planar gas phase one the cl c c cl dihedral angle changed from 180 of the gas phase tce to 124 6 of the adsorbed species the deviated tce configuration reveals sp2 sp3 hybridization of the c c bond which agrees with previous theoretical observations for tce on both fe 110 lim et al 2009 and pdcu 110 barbosa et al 2002 3 6 2 tce and hydrogen adsorption on fe3ni 111 with nom tce adsorption at the most stable site of the fe3ni 111 6 6 surface was compared with the presence of nom likely containing cooh or oh functional groups such as ba and ph the adsorption energy of tce in the presence of ba and ph are 1 50 and 0 75 ev respectively fig 9 b and 9 c indicating that the tce adsorption strength can vary depending on the nature of nom if the adsorption interaction of nom with the catalytic surface is relatively strong the interaction between the surface and tce becomes relatively weak because the available electron charge of the surface used for interaction is limited this is supported by the adsorption energy of ba and ph on the pristine fe3ni 111 6 6 surface 0 96 and 1 79 ev respectively in fig s13 comparing the tce adsorption strength depending on the ba adsorption positions fig s13 and s14 the weaker the ba adsorption the stronger the tce adsorption the relatively weaker adsorption of ba may be attributed to the steric hindrance effect of the cooh structure located perpendicular to the benzene ring of ba the cooh structure prevents the ba structure from adsorbing close to the fe3ni 111 surface furthermore the adsorption strength of tce is more stable in the presence of ba than on the pristine surface which is due to the stable interaction between the chlorine atom of tce which has a relatively large electronegativity and the hydrogen atom of ba another adsorption configuration of each nom and another tce adsorption in the presence of nom are shown in fig s13 and s14 respectively in the presence of ba on the fe3ni 111 surface the adsorption strength of tce becomes stronger which in turn leads to an enhanced tce reduction reaction because the c cl bond becomes more activated i e more elongated for dissociation the average c cl bond length of tce is activated both in absence and presence of nom from 1 713 å tce in gas phase to a maximum of 1 853 å see table 1 these observations show that the strong tce adsorption activates the c cl bond thus reveals that the presence of nom like ba highly favors tce dehalogenation reaction on the fe3ni 111 surface furthermore the differences in adsorption energies reflect trends in surface reactivity thus e a d s would be useful for characterizing the activity trends of chloroethylenes and their relative energetics similarly hydrogen adsorption at the ni top site on fe3ni 111 6 6 where tce was strongly adsorbed was compared with the presence of nom ba and ph the adsorption energy of hydrogen at ni top site in presence of ba and ph are 2 58 and 2 34 ev respectively which varies based on the nature of nom interaction with the fe3ni 111 surface as shown in fig 10 compared with the case in the absence of nom e a d s 2 40 ev the trend of hydrogen adsorption strength depending on the absence or presence of nom is similar to the trend of tce adsorption strength described above in that a relatively stronger hydrogen adsorption may be attributed to a relatively weaker interaction of nom with the catalytic surface to conclude depending on the nature of nom the adsorption of tce and hydrogen is either stronger or weaker than in the absence of nom ba with cooh and oh groups interacts relatively weakly with the fe3ni 111 surface due to the steric hindrance effect of the cooh structure of ba resulting in relatively stronger tce adsorption a stronger tce adsorption may further enhance the tce reduction reaction by weakening or stretching the c cl bonds of tce on the other hand in the case of ph with oh group the opposite phenomenon is shown furthermore the electronic property analysis demonstrated that the relatively larger electron density of ni atoms in the fe3ni alloy adsorbs hydrogen more strongly which in turn will serve as an advantageous factor in terms of providing activated hydrogen in the tce reduction reaction 3 7 tce degradation mechanism based on the above mentioned results the effect of z nom on the properties of nf nz and the catalytic mechanism of tce dechlorination scheme 1 can be proposed during the catalyst synthesis the ferric ions can be reduced to fe0 by nabh4 followed by the reduction of the ni ions to ni0 on the surface of nzvi thus the ni atoms shield the surface of the nzvi core from oxidation by the external atmosphere as shown in fig 3 during this process the ni0 shell is capped by z nom which prevents the rapid oxidation of metallic ni by the external atmosphere scheme 1 this might be responsible for the higher ni0 content in nf nz than in nf nz600c because ni0 acts as a co catalyst that facilitates the adsorption of the atomic hydrogen evolved in the iron oxidation which is crucial for the dechlorination reaction the lower ni0 content in the nf nz600c sample might be responsible for the poor activity also the nom specifically ba of the nf nz facilitates the adsorption of the tce molecules and h atoms on the surface of fe ni bimetal as shown in the dft models in scheme 1 accordingly the interaction of the cooh functional group of the nom with the chloride atoms of tce molecules shown with red crossings in scheme 1 reduces the activation energy for the dissociation of c cl bond thus the nom effectively reduces the adsorption energies and lowers the activation energies for the tce degradation reaction as substantiated by the dft studies in the catalytic mechanism the tce degradation reaction initially proceeds with the transfer of electrons from the fe0 to ni0 surface step 1 of scheme 1 due to the higher reduction potential of fe0 than that of ni0 the pooling of electrons on the surface of ni0 makes it suitable for the adsorption of unsaturated tce molecules step 4 of scheme 1 the corrosion of nzvi by water molecules generates molecular h2 step 2 of scheme 1 which can be adsorbed as atomic hydrogen on the surface of ni0 by dissociative adsorption rate determining step 3 of scheme 1 the active atomic hydrogen can instantly react with the pre adsorbed tce and produce ethylene via the dechlorination mechanism step 5 of scheme 1 the ethylene molecules can further adsorb on the ni0 surface through cleavage of the π bonds step 6 of scheme 1 and interact with the atomic hydrogen to produce ethane as the final product step 7 of scheme 1 kumar et al 2017 4 conclusions in this study we investigated the effect of mineral induced z nom on the synthesis of an nf nz catalyst and the catalytic dechlorination of tce the results of the dechlorination experiments clearly showed that natural zeolite can be applied as an efficient support for ni0 fe0 nanoparticles a high surface area with a porous structure and long hydrophobic chains of z nom conferred on the natural zeolite a superior mobility and improved dispersion than the other support materials h2 production experiments confirmed that ni0 acted as an efficient co catalyst with fe0 to enhance the rate of the dechlorination reaction a comparison of the activities of nf nz and nf nz600c confirmed the role of z nom in improving the reactivity dispersibility and mobility of the nf nz sample the feasible generation followed by the efficient transfer of hydrogen to the reaction sites by the ni fe bimetal facilitates the degradation of tce to ethane as the final product the nf nz sample showed good activity for tce dechlorination in the real ground water samples reveals its applicability for real time applications fig s15 the electronic property analysis by dft studies demonstrated that the relatively larger electron density of ni atoms in the fe3ni alloy adsorbs hydrogen more strongly which in turn will serve as an advantageous factor in terms of providing activated hydrogen in the tce reduction reaction also the adsorption behaviors of tce and atomic hydrogen on the fe3ni 111 surface in the absence and presence of nom ba and ph were investigated by dft studies that elucidated the effect of nom on the tce adsorption characteristics a stronger interaction of ba groups of nom with the tce enhanced the tce adsorption by the interaction of cooh groups with the cl atoms and accordingly improved the reduction reaction by weakening or stretching the c cl bonds of tce thus the results obtained from this study highlight the positive effects of z nom enriched in natural minerals on the synthesis of highly efficient dispersible mobile and air stable catalysts for dehydrochlorination processes supporting information

15643,herein we report the significant effects of natural organic matter contained in natural zeolite z nom on the physicochemical characteristics of a ni fe natural zeolite nf nz catalyst and its decontamination performance toward the dechlorination of trichloroethylene tce z nom predominantly consists of humic like substances and has demonstrable utility in the synthesis of bimetallic catalysts compared to nf nz600c devoid of z nom nf nz had increased dispersibility and mobility and showed significant enhancement in the catalytic dechlorination of tce owing to the encapsulation of ni0 fe0 nanoparticles by z nom the results of corrosion experiments spectroscopic analyses and h2 production experiments confirmed that ni0 acted as an efficient cocatalyst with fe0 to enhance the dechlorination of tce to ethane and z nom capped ni0 showed improved adsorption of tce and atomic hydrogen on their reactive sites and oxidation resistance the density functional theory dft studies have substantiated the improved adsorption of tce due to the presence of nom especially by cooh structure and the enhanced charge density at the ni site in the ni fe bimetal alloy for the stronger adsorption of hydrogen atoms that ultimately enhanced the tce reduction reaction these findings illustrate the efficiency of nom containing natural minerals toward the synthesis of bimetallic

2018 for this reason various metals such as pd ni ag pt and cu have been used for the synthesis of nzvi based bimetal catalysts tran et al 2020 venkateshaiah et al 2022 among them ni is a cheap alternative to replace the precious metals as a cocatalyst for dechlorination of chlorinated organic compounds the hydrodechlorination reaction depends on the adsorption capacity of atomic hydrogen and the chlorinated organics on the metal surface compared to other metals ni has relatively high adsorption for atomic hydrogen and chlorinated compounds by forming ni cl bonds kumar et al 2017 ni metal can also be used as an electron transfer medium which can overcome the self inhibition in electron transfer ni fe nano bimetal usually has a higher specific surface area and can have more active sites liu et al 2022 surface modification of nzvi with polymers or surfactants is another approach to improve the colloidal stability of the nanoparticles which leads to improved mobility in subsurface environments kumar et al 2017 zhang et al 2002 the immobilization of nzvi on various supports e g biochar jiang et al 2022 bentonite gopal et al 2020 kaolinite moyo and nkambule 2022 zeolite eljamal et al 2022 reduced graphene oxide kang et al 2022 and activated carbon ndagijimana et al 2022 has been studied recently with the aim of improving the dispersion stability and reactivity in particular natural zeolite nz obtained from the mining industry can be used for large scale applications owing to its renewability low cost and abundant availability moreover its high thermal and chemical stability catalyzing ability and adsorption capacity toward various contaminants underline its significant potential for use as a support material for the practical remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by cvocs kaliya et al 2022 valdés et al 2021 to perform soil and groundwater remediation using nzvi based catalysts their interactions with the target contaminants as well as non contaminants such as natural organic matter nom should be systematically investigated nom omnipresent in subsurface environments han et al 2019 comprise complex alkyl and aromatic organic molecules with hydroxyl carboxylic and quinone functional groups humic fulvic like that can influence the surface charge and reactivity of the samples louie et al 2016 świetlik et al 2004 indeed many researchers have reported the detrimental effect of nom on the removal efficiency of pollutants by different types of fe based materials han et al 2019 yi et al 2019 some studies have also revealed that nom interactions can influence the stability mobility and reactivity of nzvi and bentonite supported ni fe catalysts ratpukdi et al 2021 wang et al 2016 previous studies have demonstrated the effect of aqueous nom on the catalytic reactions of nzvi based catalysts however the effect of the nom already existing in the starting material itself on the natural mineral surface has not been investigated because natural minerals obtained from soil environments can potentially contain a high content of nom fox et al 2017 their use as a support material for the synthesis of reactive catalysts can significantly influence the various characteristics of the catalysts hui et al 2021 moreover no comparative computational studies on the adsorption of tce and hydrogen on the ni fe nanoparticle surface in absence and presence of nom functional groups cooh or oh etc have been reported structures of chemically adsorbed tce on metallic iron zhang et al 2008 activated adsorption of a hydrophobic organic contaminant in mineral micropores farrell et al 2002 tce hydrodehalogenation mechanism on pd 111 surface kausamo et al 2014 surfaces of ni fe bimetals he et al 2015 singh et al 2011 were studied because of insufficient existing reports and to support the experimental findings study on tce and hydrogen adsorption energetics in presence of nom on the ni fe surface is necessary in this study we used a naturally occurring zeolite that inherently contains nom z nom to examine the effect of z nom on the synthesis of bimetallic catalysts suitable for decontamination processes specifically we investigated the effect of z nom on the physicochemical properties of bimetallic catalysts and evaluated their catalytic performance dispersion mobility and air stability ni fe nzvi bimetallic catalyst supported by z nom containing natural zeolite nf nz was synthesized and applied for the catalytic dechlorination of tce a recalcitrant for human health de miranda and greenamyre 2020 vlaanderen et al 2013 then by using density functional theory dft calculations chemisorption of tce and atomic hydrogen on ni fe bimetal catalyst surfaces in presence and absence of natural organic matter were studied at the molecular electronic level politzer et al 1993 wimmer 1996 the main objectives of this study were to i characterize the z nom and develop catalyst i e nf nz ii investigate the influence of z nom on the characteristics of nf nz iii evaluate the catalytic performance transport in the sand column and air stability of nf nz compared to nf nz devoid of z nom i e nf nz600c iv study the adsorption behaviors of tce and atomic hydrogen on the ni fe surface by dft in presence of nom and v identify the enhanced dechlorination mechanism of tce by nf nz on the basis

were purchased from daejung chemicals south korea unless stated otherwise all the experiments were conducted using deaerated deionized water ddiw which was prepared by purging diw with ar gas for 4 h 2 2 synthesis of nf nz and other control materials nf nz was synthesized by the sodium borohydride activation method using iron chloride and nickel chloride salts first 1 g of nz support was dispersed in ddiw and sonicated for 10 min a solution prepared by dissolving 0 242 g of fecl3 6h2o in 10 ml of ddiw was added dropwise to the nz suspension and stirred for 1 h subsequently 40 ml of 1 m nabh4 solution was added dropwise under vigorous stirring for 30 min finally a solution of 0 02 g of nicl2 6h2o in 10 ml ddiw was added dropwise and the stirring was continued for another 30 min the solid product was collected via filtration washed with ethanol and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 οc for 6 h the prepared sample which contains 0 5 wt ni and 5 wt fe is denoted as nf nz similarly the control samples with 5 wt fe 5 wt was used as a reference and 0 25 1 and 2 wt ni were prepared and labelled as nf nz0 25 nf nz1 0 and nf nz2 0 respectively bare samples of nzvi 10 wt ni doped nzvi nf considering the ni fe ratio of 1 10 in nf nz 5 wt fe supported on nz f nz and 0 5 wt ni supported on nz n nz were also prepared for comparison to investigate the effect of the support ni fe bimetallic catalysts supported by elvan sericite and feldspar were prepared by the method described above and labeled as nf elvan nf sericite and nf feldspar respectively to examine the effect of z nom on the reactivity mobility and air stability of nf nz we prepared a z nom removed nz sample by calcination of nz at 600 οc for 4 h nz600c under aerobic conditions nz600c was used as the support to prepare the control sample which consisted of 0 5 wt ni and 5 wt fe supported on nz nf nz600c 2 3 dechlorination of tce the degradation of tce was conducted via batch experiments using the synthesized catalysts first a fresh tce stock solution 50 mm was prepared in methanol and used for the tce degradation experiments glass serum bottles 27 ml with rubber septa and aluminum capping were used as the batch reactors all the samples used for the tce experiments were prepared in an anaerobic chamber coy lab product approximately 20 mg of the catalyst and 19 96 ml of ddiw were introduced into the serum bottle thereafter 40 μl of the tce stock solution was injected into the prepared suspension to initiate the dechlorination reaction of 0 1 mm tce the bottles were immediately capped with rubber septa sealed with aluminum caps and removed from the anaerobic chamber the bottles were shaken well to disperse the catalyst and mounted on an orbital mixer 10 rpm kept at room temperature 25 0 5 c at each interval two bottles duplicate samples were sacrificed for headspace gas sampling using an airtight micro syringe 2 4 characterization of catalysts the physical and chemical characteristics of the synthesized catalysts were investigated using various surface analyses such as thermogravimetric analysis tga n 1000 scinco korea x ray fluorescence xrf panalytical epsilon 3 xl germany

instruments equipped with a capillary column rtx 1301 w integra guard 30 m 0 535 mm restek usa at each sampling 100 μl of the gas sample was collected from the headspace of the sacrificed batch reactor the characteristics of the nom present in the nz were analyzed using fluorescence and uv a absorption spectroscopy table s1 electrochemical analysis was performed using an sp 150 electrochemical workstation biologic france sedimentation and mobility tests were performed using a quartz cuvette and column reactor respectively the details of the sample preparation and tce measurements z nom analysis sedimentation and mobility tests and electrochemical analysis are provided in the supporting information 2 6 computational studies the details of the computational studies are provided in the supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of z nom and its embedment in nf nz catalyst fig s1 a and b shows the effect of z nom table s1 during the synthesis of nf nz and nf nz600c by the addition of nabh4 respectively after adding nabh4 and the fe and ni precursor solutions to the nz suspension a color change from yellow to black was observed due to the reduction of fe iii to fe 0 with the occurrence of foam fig s1 a while case of nf nz600c did not show any generation of foam during the synthesis procedure fig s1 b in general surfactants such as sodium or potassium salts of long chain hydrocarbons can act as foaming agents that reduce the surface tension of water denkov et al 2009 since the ph of the nabh4 solution was close to 10 it was postulated that the nom containing nz might act as a natural surfactant because the z nom in clay minerals and zeolites can be extracted in solutions at high ph araujo et al 2014 to identify the nature of the z nom we first extracted it using a 0 3 m naoh solution fox et al 2017 schnitzer and schuppli 1989 and analyzed its molecular weight mw distributions using high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec and fluorescence spectroscopy fig 1 a c z nom consists of either aromatic or aliphatic organic materials such as humic like substances and biomolecules hence its physicochemical properties i e aromaticity and elemental composition mw and functional group composition vary considerably depending on the origin of the nom the aromatic counterpart of z nom consisted solely of a low mw fraction the highest uva response of z nom corresponded to 1 590 da fig 1 a which is indicative of humic like substances 4000 da huber et al 2011 similarly a relatively strong fluorescence peak was detected for the protein like components of z nom in the nz mw 1 070 da fig 1 b however despite the much higher sensitivity the uva response of z nom maximum intensity 8120 mv was slightly higher than its fluorescence response maximum intensity 7120 mv peer reviewed characterizing aquatic dissolved organic matter 2003 this implies that z nom primarily comprises hydrophobic compounds i e humic like substances the high range of the suva value suva 8 0 and the fluorescence peak location of z nom the excitation and emission wavelengths were 290 and 470 nm respectively table s1 and fig 1 c further established that humic like substances were the key components of the organic material coated nz chon et al 2013 z nom was further characterized by performing tga of the raw nz and nz600c fig 1 d the first weight loss step below 300 c was attributed to the removal of water molecules physisorbed on the nz aloulou et al 2021 mosai et al 2019 the second weight loss step below 500 c can be ascribed to the dehydroxylation condensation of the silanol groups in the nz aloulou et al 2021 ates and hardacre 2012 the weight loss from 500 to 900 c was attributed to the decomposition or oxidation of carbons i e z nom present in the nz eltaweil et al 2020 the three weight losses described above were clearly observed in the nz sample indicating the presence of z nom however these clear weight losses between 100 and 300 c and 500 900 c were not observed in the nz600c sample instead only a small weight loss between 300 and 500 c was observed because of the presence of a negligible proportion of surface silanol groups in nz600c which were removed by condensation at 600 c the synthesized nf nz and nf nz600c were further subjected to tga fig 1 e both the catalysts exhibited a weight loss below 400 c with a weight gain in the temperature range of 400 500 c this weight gain was due to the oxidation of the ni fe bimetals to their corresponding oxide phases eltaweil et al 2020 habish et al 2017 a weight gain of only 0 6 was observed for nf nz compared to the 1 5 weight gain for nf nz600c this difference was probably due to the inhibitive ni fe oxidation by z nom in nf nz and the strong interactions between the ni fe bimetals and the nz support the weight loss at temperatures exceeding 500 c attributed to the decomposition of z nom was observed to be 0 8 for nf nz as compared to the marginal loss for nf nz600c indicating the existence of z nom in the nf nz sample the tga results indicated that the z nom present in the nf nz catalyst can strongly interact with the ni fe bimetal particles and impede metal oxidation whereas the lack of z nom resulted in more pronounced oxidation of the ni fe bimetals in nf nz600c 3 2 effect of z nom on structure and morphology of nf nz fig 2 a shows the ftir spectra of nf nz nf nz600c and the bare supports i e nz and nz600c in general the bare supports and bimetallic catalysts exhibited similar ftir patterns except for a shoulder peak at 1400 cm 1 in the nf nz sample which was ascribed to the formation of oxidized species on the surfaces of the ni fe bimetals tasharrofi et al 2020 the peaks observed at 1100 and 474 cm 1 are related respectively to the si o tetrahedral bending band and si o si stretching vibration corresponding to silica or quartz coudurier et al 1982 the nf nz sample showed strong o h stretching 3420 cm 1 bending 1645 cm 1 vibrations originating from the adsorbed water in the zeolite pores in addition a strong peak at 3620 cm 1 attributed to hydrogen bonding with the si o si linkage was obtained for the nz and nf nz samples the al oh liberation band at 915 cm 1 and al oh out of plane vibration at 796 cm 1 were prominent for the nz and nf nz samples liu et al 2014 while they were absent for the nz600c and nf nz600c samples indicating the transformation of the al oh groups to al o al linkages frost et al 2003 as observed in the tga profiles the calcination of nz resulted in the loss of surface oh functionality in addition the weak c h vibrations at 2855 and 2930 cm 1 confirmed the presence of organic functionalities i e z nom in the nz and nf nz samples whereas the nz600c and nf nz600c lack these vibrations probably because of the removal of organic moieties i e z nom in the natural zeolite at high temperature calcination the removal of nom at high temperature calcination was also substantiated by the tga profiles discussed in the earlier part fig 1 d and e fig 2 b shows the xrd patterns of the samples nz and nz600c showed similar patterns which confirmed that nz retained its structural stability even after calcination at 600 c furthermore the ni fe bimetal deposition on nz did not result in any significant changes in the xrd patterns of the support material no peaks were observed for the fe or ni metals because of the low detection limit of xrd for elemental analysis 2 and high intensity of silica and alumina related peaks i e quartz and clinoptilolite from nz cheng et al 2017 hamid et al 2020 the xrf results showed a high content of sio2 and al2o3 85 in total in raw nz with 8 fe2o3 and other oxide phases table s2 n2 adsorption desorption experiments were performed to measure the bet surface area pore size and pore volumes of the nf and nf nz samples fig 2 c and d and table s3 typical n2 adsorption desorption curves were obtained for nz and nf nz fig 2 c which showed an h3 hysteresis loop in the range of 0 45 1 0 p p0 according to the iupac classification sing et al 1985 these results may be due to the multilayer adsorption and capillary condensation in the mesopores or in the space between the clinoptilolite crystallites of the natural zeolite favvas et al 2016 the bet surface area and pore volumes of the nz and nf nz samples were found to be 77 13 and 48 07 m2 g and 0 22 and 0 21 cm3 g respectively it is plausible that the blockage of the pores by the ni fe bimetal particles supported on the nz surface was responsible for the reduction in the surface area of nf nz to investigate the morphological characteristics of nf nz we conducted fesem analysis sheet like morphologies were observed for nz and nz600c fig s2 a and b which is typical of clinoptilolite zeolites favvas et al 2016 in contrast a fine distribution of ni fe bimetal nanoparticles over the surface of nz and nz600c was observed in nf nz and nf nz600c fig s2 c and d the magnified sem image of nf nz shows that the spherical bimetal nanoparticles with a particle size of approximately 50 100 nm were well distributed on the surfaces of nz and nz600c the nf nz catalyst was further characterized using fetem fig 3 the tem images clearly revealed the presence of ni fe bimetal nanoparticles which were uniformly distributed on the nz surface interestingly we observed thin and transparent layers at the surface edges and corners of nz red arrows in fig 3 a and b from the magnified fetem image fig 3 c it was confirmed that the ni fe bimetal nanoparticles were capped by carbon matter i e z nom the absence of any lattice patterns in the fetem images confirmed the amorphous nature of the ni fe bimetals lin et al 2010 lin et al observed amorphous nzvi in the presence of polyacrylic acid paa and carboxymethyl cellulose cmc according to their report the reduced amorphous primary iron 1 3 nm particles can be assembled into large spherical secondary iron particles 50 100 nm nzvi observed using fesem and fetem during the reduction by nabh4 owing to the presence of paa cmc and ostwald ripening in addition when the thin layer of z nom was exposed to a high resolution tem beam the z nom surface appeared to be altered the high energy tem beam burned the z nom template and created pores in the structure as observed in fig s3 red circles this z nom template might efficiently shield the bimetal surface from oxidation and improve the dispersion by reducing the magnetic attraction between the nzvi particles ruiz torres et al prepared an improved ethylene glycol functionalized nzvi in an open atmosphere which resulted in enhanced aerobic stability of the nzvi ruiz torres et al 2018 in addition kumar et al stabilized the surface of nzvi nanoparticles using polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp kumar et al 2017 however in the previous studies external additives were added to the nzvi suspensions this is comparable with this study which demonstrates the role of the naturally existing z nom in nz that functions as an in situ stabilizer during the synthesis of the catalyst fig 3 d shows the sei image and fig 3 e j illustrates the eds mapping images of the different elements fe ni c si al and o respectively present in the nf nz sample the uniform and fine distribution of ni on the surface of the fe nanoparticles can be clearly seen in the eds mapping fig 3 e and f indicating that the formation of the nzvi nanoparticles preceded the reduction of ni ions on the nzvi surface 3 3 effect of z nom on mobility and corrosion of nf nz sedimentation and mobility tests were performed to investigate the effect of z nom encapsulation on the mobility of nf nz in the soil system fig s4 a and b for nzvi the magnetic force leads to a strong attraction between the nanoparticles resulting in rapid agglomeration and complete sedimentation in 40 min fig s4 a for nz600c we observed 50 sedimentation in 60 min while the nz suspension showed a higher dispersion 20 sedimentation in 60 min which was probably due to the presence of z nom finally nf nz showed the highest dispersibility while rapid sedimentation occurred in the nf nz600c suspension in the mobility test nf nz600c showed poor mobility in the sand column resulting in only 30 catalyst recovery fig s4 b in contrast 65 of the nf nz was recovered continuously in the sand column indicating that the mobility of nf nz can be significantly improved by z nom encapsulation of the catalyst surface the results indicate that the increased particle density due to the addition of ni and fe and strong magnetic interactions between the nzvi particles supported on nz600c might be responsible for rapid agglomeration and poor dispersion and mobility however these problems are addressed in the z nom encapsulated nf nz in which z nom functions as an organic stabilizer to understand the effect of surface properties on the dispersion and mobility the zeta potentials of the nf nz and nf nz600c samples were measured at ph 3 5 7 9 and 11 fig s4 e the zeta potentials shifted to more negative values as the ph of the solution increased from 3 to 11 in particular the zeta potential values of nf nz were much more negative than those of nf nz600c the higher negative surface characteristics of nf nz might have originated from the surface functional groups carboxylic or phenolic of the z nom the macromolecules comprising the z nom in nf nz interact with the surface either by complexation with carboxylic phenolic or hydroxylic groups or through hydrophobic interactions zhu et al 2014 these macromolecules have low pka values 3 7 for fulvic acid and 4 3 humic acid ritchie and michael perdue 2003 therefore at higher ph free charged groups generate a net negative surface charge on the samples gallego urrea et al 2014 thus the long chains of z nom can create steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion between the nf nz particles and inhibit the interaction of the nf nz particles with the silica sand particles resulting in enhanced dispersion and mobility the particle sizes of the nf nz catalyst in aqueous dispersions were also studied by the dls analysis fig s4 f wherein the nf nz showed uniform particle sizes after 1 h of dispersion time confirming its superior dispersibility one of the major problems hindering the practical application of nzvi is the rapid surface passivation by atmospheric oxygen during long term storage bae et al 2018 to evaluate the corrosion behaviors of nzvi nf nf nz and nf nz600c we monitored the tafel plots of each sample fig 4 b polarized in the potential range from 0 6 to 0 v in aqueous aerobic conditions at neutral ph 0 05 m na2so4 fig 4 a the nzvi exhibited a strong polarization behavior with a negative corrosion potential of 0 406 v and a corrosion current of 0 778 μa table s4 however the ni fe bimetallic nanoparticles i e nf showed a reduction in the negative corrosion potential 0 397 v with a lower corrosion current of 0 641 μa indicating that the corrosion of nzvi was slightly decreased by the addition of ni interestingly nf nz600c showed the highest negative corrosion potential 0 438 v and positive corrosion current 0 860 μa whereas nf nz showed the lowest negative potential 0 365 v and positive corrosion current 0 399 μa this result indicates that the presence of ni and z nom in nf nz decreases the corrosion of the ni fe bimetals and improves their resistance to oxidation a similar observation was reported by greenlee et al wherein the ni shell and cmc stabilized the nzvi surface from oxidation in an o2 rich aqueous solution greenlee et al 2012 the absence of z nom in the structure of nf nz600c resulted in the direct exposure of the nzvi surface to the oxidizing agents whereas for the nf nz sample the nzvi surface was capped by the hydrophobic z nom which prevented the oxidizing agents from reaching the nzvi surface ratpukdi et al 2021 xps analyses of fresh and air exposed for 15 d nf nz and nf nz600c were conducted to validate the enhanced air resistance and stability a typical fe 2p3 2 spectrum of the nf nz sample fresh and air exposed is shown in fig 5 a the fe 2p3 2 peak was deconvoluted into three peaks with binding energies of 706 7 709 9 and 712 6 ev corresponding to fe0 fe2 and fe3 respectively he et al 2018 kumar et al 2017 the ratio of fe0 to fe2 fe3 was calculated to be approximately 0 14 and 0 11 for the fresh and air exposed for 15 d samples respectively similarly the ni 2p3 2 spectrum was deconvoluted into two peaks with binding energies of 852 5 and 855 6 ev corresponding to the ni0 and ni2 states respectively fig 5 c kumar et al 2017 the ni0 to ni2 ratio was calculated to be 0 30 and 0 28 the surface proportions of the fe0 and ni0 species were marginally lower for the 15 d air exposed sample compared to those of the fresh nf nz sample the ratio of fe0 to fe2 fe3 was found to be approximately 0 16 and 0 08 for the fresh and 15 d air exposed samples of nf nz600c respectively fig 5 b the ni0 to ni2 ratio was calculated to be 0 15 and 0 12 for the fresh and air exposed samples respectively fig 5 d overall the percentage of fe0 on the surface of the nf nz600c sample declined to 50 compared to that on the nf nz sample 20 the ni0 to ni2 ratio of the nf nz and nf nz600c samples was almost stable after 15 d of air exposure the fast oxidation of fe0 might be due to its strong reduction potential 0 4 v compared to that of zerovalent nickel 0 25 v in the case of the nf nz sample the presence of z nom led to the slower aerial oxidation of fe0 than that of the nf nz600c sample in which the fe0 of nf nz600c was directly exposed to air moreover the surface ni0 content in the nf nz sample was almost twice that of the nf nz600c sample these results indicate that z nom encapsulation of the nf nz catalyst improved its air stability the nature of z nom was further analyzed using the c 1s xps spectra of nf nz fig 5 e the c 1s peak is deconvoluted into various peaks with binding energies of 284 0 284 8 285 7 286 3 287 4 and 288 7 ev araujo et al 2014 the peak at 284 8 ev can be attributed to adventitious carbon the peak at 284 ev represents the c c bonds in the z nom structure and the peak at 285 7 ev can be indexed to the hydroxyl or phenolic groups the binding energy of 286 3 ev corresponds to the sp3 carbon bonded to the o atom related to the epoxide or ether functionality the other two peaks at 287 4 and 288 7 ev can be attributed to the carbonyl and carboxyl functionalities in z nom analysis of the c 1s functional group of the nf nz sample indicated the presence of humic like substances as observed in the 3d feem with many oh and cooh functional groups as observed in the ftir which can host the iron ions during activation by nabh4 and may form a capping layer on the surface of the fe0 nuclei similar peaks were observed for the used nf nz sample fig 5 f indicating a strong interaction between the z nom and ni fe bimetals supported on nz 3 4 effect of z nom on catalytic dechlorination of tce and longevity of reactivity fig 6 illustrates the catalytic dechlorination kinetics of tce by nf nz and its controls no significant adsorption of tce was observed in the blank and nz alone fig 6 a indicating a negligible loss of tce through contact with the wall of the batch reactor and nz itself the bare nzvi showed almost 10 tce degradation after 12 h of reaction during the reaction we observed that nzvi tended to rapidly aggregate because of the strong magnetic attraction resulting in poor mass transfer of the tce molecules to the reaction sites of nzvi approximately 32 of the tce was degraded after 12 h of reaction in presence of the nf bimetallic catalyst which confirms that the dechlorination of tce was enhanced by ni addition kumar et al 2017 compared to nzvi alone the nzvi supported on nz i e f nz exhibited no significant degradation of tce while the ni supported on nz n nz showed 30 degradation in 6 h these results indicate that the addition of a small fraction of ni 0 5 wt played a more significant role in the reductive degradation of tce than the addition of a larger proportion of fe 5 wt finally the substantial role of ni was established by the activity of nf nz which showed a complete degradation of tce in 90 min fig s5 a to further examine the role of ni the tce degradation was studied by varying the ni fraction from 0 25 to 2 wt at a fixed fe content 5 wt fig 6 b the tce degradation rate increased with the increase in ni content and the kinetic rate constants obtained by fitting the data to the pseudo first order model also showed a continuous increase in their values from 0 022 0 25 wt 0 043 0 5 wt and 0 089 1 0 wt to 0 129 min 1 2 0 wt which confirmed the crucial role of ni in the tce degradation however the lower activity of n nz for tce dechlorination probably because of its lower reduction potential to produce atomic hydrogen as compared to the nzvi hence despite having good adsorption capacity for atomic hydrogen and tce its inactiveness to produce large amounts of atomic hydrogen resulted in poor activity for n nz catalyst nevertheless ni has vital role in enhancing the activity of nf nz iron due to the high reduction potential can produce large number of hydrogen atoms in the solution however most of them are not involved in the dechlorination reaction in fact produce unreactive hydrogen gas in the fe ni bimetal catalyst the ni plays vital role in adsorbing these reactive hydrogen atoms and transferring them to the preadsorbed tce molecules to promote the dechlorination reaction kumar et al 2017 nickel metal can also serve as an electron transfer medium which can overcome the self inhibition in electron transfer liu et al 2022 the impact of z nom on the catalytic performance of nf nz was investigated by conducting tce degradation experiments using nf nz600c fig 6 c according to these results nf nz600c exhibited a delayed removal of tce at 300 min fig s5 b and the kinetic rate constant was 3 5 times lower than that observed for the degradation performed using nf nz 0 012 min 1 therefore the results confirmed that z nom significantly enhanced the catalytic degradation of tce to understand the effect of the support the nf nz sample was compared with other ni fe bimetal modified supports containing si al such as elvan feldspar and sericite among all these catalysts nf nz showed the highest catalytic activity fig 6 d the sedimentation and mobility profiles of nf elvan nf feldspar and nf sericite fig s4 c and d also revealed poor dispersibility and mobility compared to the nf nz sample since silica is hydrophilic in nature hydrophilic samples tend to show lower mobility due to the strong hydrophilic interactions this might be responsible for the low mobility of the nf feldspar nf sericite and nf elvan samples which do not contain mineral induced z nom johnson et al reported that the addition of nom to nzvi suspensions causes the sorption of nom on nzvi resulting in a reduced stacking coefficient which might be responsible for improved mobility johnson et al 2009 however this study was done by additional injection of nom not from the support material likely in this study fig 6 e and f show the formation of byproducts during tce dechlorination by nf nz and nf nz600c respectively we observed the formation of ethane a major product and ethylene as a byproduct during the dechlorination of tce by the nf nz and nf nz600c fig s6 whereas the β elimination byproducts such as di chlorinated acetylenes mono chlorinated acetylene trans dichloroethylene cis dichloroethylene 1 1 dichloroethylene and vinyl chloride were not detected despite using a gc column i e rtx 1301 capable of detecting these byproducts these results may be due to the insufficient detection limit of the gc system or the loss of chlorinated or non chlorinated byproducts during the sampling and injection procedures which led to 20 loss of carbon mass balance fig 6 e and f further a slight variation in the ph was observed for the nf nz and nf nz600c catalysts before and after reaction fig s7 probably due to the release of hcl into the solution which further confirms the dechlorination of tce by the as synthesized catalysts brovelli et al 2012 cao et al 2020 liu et al 2007 the change in the ph was negligible for nzvi maybe because of its poor reactivity for dechlorination of tce to check the effect of ph change on the dissolution of fe ni bimetals supported on nz and nz600c the fe and ni concentrations in the solution were analyzed after the tce degradation reaction the nf nz and nf nz600c did not show dissolution of fe or ni in 2 h however showed ni concentration of 2 14 and 4 414 ppb respectively after 6h reaction time to examine the air stability of nf nz we prepared air aged samples 5 10 and 30 d of nf nz and nf nz600c and used them for tce dechlorination fig 7 a and b in general the degradation efficiency of tce decreased continuously with the increase in the air aging time for nf nz the rate constant decreased from 0 043 to 0 027 min 1 after 30 d of air exposure fig 7 c whereas that for nf nz600c decreased significantly from 0 0125 to 0 005 min 1 fig 7 d nf nz lost only 35 of its initial activity after 30 d of air exposure compared to the 60 loss for nf nz600c the poor stability of nf nz600c can be attributed to the oxidation of the reactive ni fe bimetals to passive inactive oxides the ultimate amount of reactive ni0 fe0 retained on the surface after the synthesis and drying of the samples is a crucial factor based on the xps results the fe0 and ni0 contents of nf nz were 14 and 30 respectively whereas the corresponding contents of nf nz600c were 16 and 15 this indicates that both the catalysts had similar fe0 contents however the ni0 content in nf nz was almost twice as high as that of nf nz600c the effect of the high ni0 content in nf nz will be further discussed in the next section 3 5 effect of z nom on catalytic mechanism to investigate the effect of z nom on the mechanism underlying the dechlorination of tce by nf nz we measured the h2 production in the suspensions of nf nz and nf nz600c in the presence and absence of tce fig s8 a much higher h2 production was observed in the nf nz suspension during the 180 min reaction than in nf nz600c in the absence of tce fig s8 a whereas lower yet highly similar h2 production rates were observed for both the suspensions in the presence of tce fig s8 b the h2 consumption of nf nz600c was approximately 60 fig s8 c with an overall h2 consumption of 2 9 μmol fig s8 d after 1 h of reaction with tce which was approximately 2 7 times lower than that of the nf nz sample 8 01 μmol the lower h2 production by nf nz600c might be due to the strong magnetic interactions leading to the aggregation of the loosely supported ni fe bimetals on the nz600c support after 1 h of reaction fig s9 b while nf nz showed almost negligible aggregation fig s9 a the strong aggregation can reduce the number of surface active catalytic centers resulting in poor h2 production despite the strong negative corrosion potential of nf nz600c table s4 in contrast the prevention of aggregation by z nom led to the presence of more surface active catalytic centers in the nf nz catalyst despite the low corrosion potential resulting in enhanced tce dechlorination through improved production and consumption of h2 notably ethylene was observed as a byproduct in the initial stage of tce dechlorination and disappeared after 90 min of reaction time in the nf nz suspension fig 6 e while nf nz600c showed a continuous retention of ethylene during the tce dechlorination fig 6 f the lack of requisite h2 might be responsible for the incomplete hydrogenation of ethylene to ethane by nf nz600c whereas the higher h2 consumption rate of nf nz propelled the hydrogenation reaction to rapidly produce ethane as the final product to investigate the role of ni in the enhanced dechlorination reaction h2 production experiments were performed in the presence and absence of 0 1 mm tce using nzvi nf f nz and nf nz fig 8 the h2 production by nzvi in the presence 0 35 μmol and absence 0 45 μmol of tce was very poor fig 8 a and b and only 22 of h2 corresponding to 0 1 μmol was consumed by the nzvi after 60 min of reaction we also observed 2 85 and 2 33 μmol of h2 production after 60 min of reaction in the absence and presence of tce respectively in the f nz suspension which indicated that the percentage of h2 consumption was low 18 despite the increased rate of h2 production by f nz for the ni fe bimetal catalyst the h2 production in the absence and presence of tce was observed to be 1 64 and 0 67 μmol respectively fig 8 d the nf catalyst consumed 0 97 μmol h2 which corresponded to an overall h2 yield of 60 indicating that the addition of ni to the nzvi improved the rate of h2 consumption from 22 to 60 fig 8 c however the nf sample exhibited a low retention of activity due to rapid agglomeration caused by the strong magnetic attractions in contrast nf nz exhibited remarkable production and consumption rates of h2 underlining the benefits of a support material and the impact of z nom on the efficient production and consumption of h2 3 6 dft investigation of the tce dechlorination on nf nz catalyst surface the dft results provide a better understanding at the atomic level interaction of nom ba and ph with the ni fe surface and the dehalogenation ability of tce in presence of nom these dft understandings at the atomistic level can thus provide an additional insight to the experimental findings 3 6 1 hydrogen and tce adsorption on pristine fe3ni 111 various hydrogen adsorption sites on the fe3ni 111 4 4 surface were considered such as ni top fe top bridge site hollow ni site and hollow fe site fig s10 the adsorption energy at various hydrogen adsorption sites ranges from 2 40 to 3 11 ev fig s11 among the observed sites the hollow ni site surrounded by two fe and one ni atoms shows the most stable adsorption of 3 11 ev this result supports the hypothesis that ni atoms on the fe3ni surface serve as a key role in preferable adsorption of tce and hydrogen in addition excess bader charge analysis upon the adsorption on the hollow ni site exhibits that the electron charges were transferred from the surface to the adsorbed h atom fig s10 fe1 0 09e and fe2 0 07e ni 0 11e and h 0 31e tce was adsorbed on five different sites on the fe3ni 111 6 6 surface and the adsorption energy ranges from 1 03 to 1 29 ev in fig s12 among the sites site 1 where the c c bond of tce is adsorbed on the top of ni preferably shows the most stable adsorption energy of 1 29 ev fig 9 a the adsorbed configuration of tce deviate significantly from the planar gas phase one the cl c c cl dihedral angle changed from 180 of the gas phase tce to 124 6 of the adsorbed species the deviated tce configuration reveals sp2 sp3 hybridization of the c c bond which agrees with previous theoretical observations for tce on both fe 110 lim et al 2009 and pdcu 110 barbosa et al 2002 3 6 2 tce and hydrogen adsorption on fe3ni 111 with nom tce adsorption at the most stable site of the fe3ni 111 6 6 surface was compared with the presence of nom likely containing cooh or oh functional groups such as ba and ph the adsorption energy of tce in the presence of ba and ph are 1 50 and 0 75 ev respectively fig 9 b and 9 c indicating that the tce adsorption strength can vary depending on the nature of nom if the adsorption interaction of nom with the catalytic surface is relatively strong the interaction between the surface and tce becomes relatively weak because the available electron charge of the surface used for interaction is limited this is supported by the adsorption energy of ba and ph on the pristine fe3ni 111 6 6 surface 0 96 and 1 79 ev respectively in fig s13 comparing the tce adsorption strength depending on the ba adsorption positions fig s13 and s14 the weaker the ba adsorption the stronger the tce adsorption the relatively weaker adsorption of ba may be attributed to the steric hindrance effect of the cooh structure located perpendicular to the benzene ring of ba the cooh structure prevents the ba structure from adsorbing close to the fe3ni 111 surface furthermore the adsorption strength of tce is more stable in the presence of ba than on the pristine surface which is due to the stable interaction between the chlorine atom of tce which has a relatively large electronegativity and the hydrogen atom of ba another adsorption configuration of each nom and another tce adsorption in the presence of nom are shown in fig s13 and s14 respectively in the presence of ba on the fe3ni 111 surface the adsorption strength of tce becomes stronger which in turn leads to an enhanced tce reduction reaction because the c cl bond becomes more activated i e more elongated for dissociation the average c cl bond length of tce is activated both in absence and presence of nom from 1 713 å tce in gas phase to a maximum of 1 853 å see table 1 these observations show that the strong tce adsorption activates the c cl bond thus reveals that the presence of nom like ba highly favors tce dehalogenation reaction on the fe3ni 111 surface furthermore the differences in adsorption energies reflect trends in surface reactivity thus e a d s would be useful for characterizing the activity trends of chloroethylenes and their relative energetics similarly hydrogen adsorption at the ni top site on fe3ni 111 6 6 where tce was strongly adsorbed was compared with the presence of nom ba and ph the adsorption energy of hydrogen at ni top site in presence of ba and ph are 2 58 and 2 34 ev respectively which varies based on the nature of nom interaction with the fe3ni 111 surface as shown in fig 10 compared with the case in the absence of nom e a d s 2 40 ev the trend of hydrogen adsorption strength depending on the absence or presence of nom is similar to the trend of tce adsorption strength described above in that a relatively stronger hydrogen adsorption may be attributed to a relatively weaker interaction of nom with the catalytic surface to conclude depending on the nature of nom the adsorption of tce and hydrogen is either stronger or weaker than in the absence of nom ba with cooh and oh groups interacts relatively weakly with the fe3ni 111 surface due to the steric hindrance effect of the cooh structure of ba resulting in relatively stronger tce adsorption a stronger tce adsorption may further enhance the tce reduction reaction by weakening or stretching the c cl bonds of tce on the other hand in the case of ph with oh group the opposite phenomenon is shown furthermore the electronic property analysis demonstrated that the relatively larger electron density of ni atoms in the fe3ni alloy adsorbs hydrogen more strongly which in turn will serve as an advantageous factor in terms of providing activated hydrogen in the tce reduction reaction 3 7 tce degradation mechanism based on the above mentioned results the effect of z nom on the properties of nf nz and the catalytic mechanism of tce dechlorination scheme 1 can be proposed during the catalyst synthesis the ferric ions can be reduced to fe0 by nabh4 followed by the reduction of the ni ions to ni0 on the surface of nzvi thus the ni atoms shield the surface of the nzvi core from oxidation by the external atmosphere as shown in fig 3 during this process the ni0 shell is capped by z nom which prevents the rapid oxidation of metallic ni by the external atmosphere scheme 1 this might be responsible for the higher ni0 content in nf nz than in nf nz600c because ni0 acts as a co catalyst that facilitates the adsorption of the atomic hydrogen evolved in the iron oxidation which is crucial for the dechlorination reaction the lower ni0 content in the nf nz600c sample might be responsible for the poor activity also the nom specifically ba of the nf nz facilitates the adsorption of the tce molecules and h atoms on the surface of fe ni bimetal as shown in the dft models in scheme 1 accordingly the interaction of the cooh functional group of the nom with the chloride atoms of tce molecules shown with red crossings in scheme 1 reduces the activation energy for the dissociation of c cl bond thus the nom effectively reduces the adsorption energies and lowers the activation energies for the tce degradation reaction as substantiated by the dft studies in the catalytic mechanism the tce degradation reaction initially proceeds with the transfer of electrons from the fe0 to ni0 surface step 1 of scheme 1 due to the higher reduction potential of fe0 than that of ni0 the pooling of electrons on the surface of ni0 makes it suitable for the adsorption of unsaturated tce molecules step 4 of scheme 1 the corrosion of nzvi by water molecules generates molecular h2 step 2 of scheme 1 which can be adsorbed as atomic hydrogen on the surface of ni0 by dissociative adsorption rate determining step 3 of scheme 1 the active atomic hydrogen can instantly react with the pre adsorbed tce and produce ethylene via the dechlorination mechanism step 5 of scheme 1 the ethylene molecules can further adsorb on the ni0 surface through cleavage of the π bonds step 6 of scheme 1 and interact with the atomic hydrogen to produce ethane as the final product step 7 of scheme 1 kumar et al 2017 4 conclusions in this study we investigated the effect of mineral induced z nom on the synthesis of an nf nz catalyst and the catalytic dechlorination of tce the results of the dechlorination experiments clearly showed that natural zeolite can be applied as an efficient support for ni0 fe0 nanoparticles a high surface area with a porous structure and long hydrophobic chains of z nom conferred on the natural zeolite a superior mobility and improved dispersion than the other support materials h2 production experiments confirmed that ni0 acted as an efficient co catalyst with fe0 to enhance the rate of the dechlorination reaction a comparison of the activities of nf nz and nf nz600c confirmed the role of z nom in improving the reactivity dispersibility and mobility of the nf nz sample the feasible generation followed by the efficient transfer of hydrogen to the reaction sites by the ni fe bimetal facilitates the degradation of tce to ethane as the final product the nf nz sample showed good activity for tce dechlorination in the real ground water samples reveals its applicability for real time applications fig s15 the electronic property analysis by dft studies demonstrated that the relatively larger electron density of ni atoms in the fe3ni alloy adsorbs hydrogen more strongly which in turn will serve as an advantageous factor in terms of providing activated hydrogen in the tce reduction reaction also the adsorption behaviors of tce and atomic hydrogen on the fe3ni 111 surface in the absence and presence of nom ba and ph were investigated by dft studies that elucidated the effect of nom on the tce adsorption characteristics a stronger interaction of ba groups of nom with the tce enhanced the tce adsorption by the interaction of cooh groups with the cl atoms and accordingly improved the reduction reaction by weakening or stretching the c cl bonds of tce thus the results obtained from this study highlight the positive effects of z nom enriched in natural minerals on the synthesis of highly efficient dispersible mobile and air stable catalysts for dehydrochlorination processes supporting information

15644,manganese mn oxide solids are ubiquitous in nature acting as both electron donors and acceptors in diverse redox reactions in the environment reactions of mn iii iv oxides with dissolved natural organic matter dom are commonly described as reductive dissolutions that generate mn2 aq in this study we investigated the role of photochemical reactions of dom in mn2 aq oxidation and the resulting formation of mn oxide solids during the photolysis of dom reactive intermediates can be generated including excited triplet state dom 3dom hydroxyl radicals oh superoxide radicals o2 hydrogen peroxide and singlet oxygen among these we found that o2 radicals were mainly responsible for mn oxidation the solution ph controlled the formation of mn oxide solids by affecting both mn2 oxidation by o2 during photolysis of dom and reductive dissolutions of mn oxide solids by dom further with the addition of bromide ions br reactions between 3dom and br together with reactions between oh and br can form reactive bromide radicals the formed br radicals also promoted mn oxide formation in dom with more aromatic functional groups more mn2 was oxidized to mn oxide solids this enhanced oxidation could be the result of promoted pathways from charge transfer state dom dom to o2 these new observations advance our understanding of natural mn2 oxidation and mn iii iv oxide formation and highlight the underappreciated oxidative roles of dom in the oxidation of metal ions in surface water illuminated by sunlight graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords abiotic manganese oxidation natural organic matter reactive oxygen species bromide radicals photochemistry data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction manganese mn is the second most abundant transition metal in the earth s crust and is found widely in aquatic and terrestrial environments butterfield et al 2013 mn has diverse oxidation states most prevalently mn ii mn iii and mn iv and its oxides have high reduction potential mno2 mn2 1 23 v stumm and morgan 1996 in addition mn oxide solids are effective scavengers of redox active species and heavy metals in nature because they can operate as both electron donors and acceptors and thus play important roles in geochemical element redox cycling carbon mineralization and biological metabolisms butterfield et al 2013 myers and nealson 1988 tebo et al 2004 in nature most mn hydr oxide solids occur in the mn iii and mn iv oxidation states formed by the oxidation of mn2 regarding the formation of mn hydr oxide solids previously the biotic mn oxidation process was believed to be the dominant oxidative pathway from mn2 aq to mn iv oxide solids in natural systems because bacteria and fungi accelerate this process by several orders of magnitude compared to abiotic processes diaz et al 2013 hansel and francis 2006 hansel et al 2012 learman et al 2011a 2011b on the other hand abiotic inorganic oxidation of mn2 aq to mn iv oxide solids has not been considered as a major pathway owing to its slow and kinetically controlled process a half life of 200 300 days huang et al 1995 recently we discovered fast abiotic oxidation of mn2 to mn iv by superoxide radicals o2 generated from nitrate photolysis jung et al 2017a at a rate comparable to biotic processes francis and tebo 2001 hansel and francis 2006 learman et al 2011a 2011b accompanied by the formation of δ mno2 nanosheets jung et al 2017a this new finding demonstrates that abiotic inorganic mn oxidation and solids formation are as important as the biotic process the redox active mn oxide solids can react with dissolved organic matter dom which is a complex matrix of organic matter that are ubiquitous in natural aquatic environments dom contains humic substances such as humic acids ha and fulvic acids fa with aromatic and carboxylic functional groups gaffney et al 1996 surface water usually contains 2 10 mgc l as dissolved organic carbon dom lapworth et al 2008 nogueira et al 2017 sillanpää 2014 studies thus far have extensively investigated the adsorption of dom on mn oxides and the reduction reactions of solid mn oxides by dom the dom adsorption on mn oxides was shown to increase with decreasing ph via surface complexation and ligand exchange allard et al 2017 tipping and heaton 1983 in addition enhanced adsorption of dom on the mn oxide solids was observed in the presence of ca2 by decreasing the electrostatic repulsion tipping and heaton 1983 furthermore the adsorption of dom on mn oxide solids was promoted by higher molecular weight molecules and higher hydrophobicity with more aromatic moieties of dom that were isolated from the suwannee river in usa the jau river in brazil and the loire river in france allard et al 2017 on the other hand mn oxide solids can oxidize dom while dom is degraded into small organic matter allard et al 2017 chorover and amistadi 2001 sunda and kieber 1994 dom can also affect the reactions between mn oxides with organic pollutants such as triclosan and chlorophene in surface water because dom can competitively adsorb on and react with mno2 zhang and huang 2003 moreover sunlight illumination accelerated the reduction of mn oxide solids by dom bertino and zepp 1991 so far most studies have considered dom to be a reducing agent for mn oxide solids rather than an oxidative source for mn2 oxidation processes however dom can behave as oxidative agents in surface water with sunlight illumination sunlight driven processes can initiate the degradation of dom accompanied by the formation of photochemically produced reactive intermediates such as excited triplet state dom 3dom o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 hydroxyl radicals oh and singlet oxygen 1o2 dalrymple et al 2010 mcneill and canonica 2016 zafiriou 1977 zafiriou et al 1984 then the generated reactive intermediates can trigger the formation of other reactive radicals for example reactive halogen species can be generated by reactions between 3dom and halide ions brigante et al 2014 de laurentiis et al 2012 jammoul et al 2009 parker and mitch 2016 and by reactions between oh and halide ions mopper and zhou 1990 neta et al 1988 this coeffect with halide ions is important because halide ions are abundant in the surface water and engineered environments specifically the surface water receives large amounts of concentrated flowback efflux that contain concentrated halide ions in desalination processes voutchkov 2011 zhang et al 2021 and in unconventional oil and gas recovery through hydraulic fracturing gregory et al 2011 large amounts of soluble organic constituents for example 2 butoxyethanol and pyridine were also produced in the flowback fracturing water butkovskyi et al 2017 gregory et al 2011 these effluents are discharged onto the surface and impounded before further treatment and reuse gregory et al 2011 voutchkov 2011 zhang et al 2021 in an ongoing investigation of abiotic mn oxidation by natural abundant radicals we have discovered the photochemical oxidation of mn2 aq by reactive halogen radicals mainly from bromide br radicals br and br2 gao et al 2020 2021a the reactive halogen radicals were generated from nitrate photolysis in the presence of naturally abundant halide ions which facilitated the oxidation of mn2 aq to δ mno2 nanosheets similarly the photolysis of dom in the presence of halide ions can be an alternative and significant pathway to generate reactive oxygen and halogen radicals for inorganic mn oxidation however there is no previous study that examines the impacts of their coexistence on mn oxidation and resulting formation of mn oxide solids previously reactive oxygen species ros and 3dom generated from photolysis of dom have been highlighted as oxidative agents mainly for organic compounds for example ros and 3dom can oxidize organic contaminants such as amine drugs mexiletine propranolol and diphenhydramine and antibiotics sulfadimethoxine chen et al 2009 guerard et al 2009 however when it came to the interactions with inorganic ions such as heavy or transition metal ions dom was typically thought to function as chelating agent allard et al 2017 cabaniss 2011 pan et al 2018 soluble mn3 species were found to be stabilized by dom and formed mn iii dom colloids li et al 2019 trouwborst et al 2006 although a previous study showed the photochemical oxidation of mn2 aq to mn oxides by humic substances and built a kinetic model to fit the experimental results nico et al 2002 information regarding mn oxidation state crystalline phase and morphology of the formed mn oxides is still unknown moreover although sodium chloride was included in the previous work nico et al 2002 the roles of generated chloride cl radicals in mn oxidation were not considered thus further study is required to fully comprehend the oxidative roles of dom in photolytic reactions with mn2 in particular we need to examine the coeffect of reactive oxygen and halogen species generated from the reactions between dom and halide ions on mn2 oxidation processes this information will help us better understand the formation of mn oxide minerals in organic environments to examine the underappreciated roles of dom in mn oxidation in the natural and engineered water this study aims to investigate the photochemical oxidation of mn2 aq in the presence of dom and halide ions both reduction reaction of mn oxide solids by dom and oxidation reaction of mn2 aq to mn oxide solids by photolysis of dom can occur at the same time hence the results here report the net reaction of the reduction and oxidation processes we found that solution ph significantly impacted the formation of mn oxide solids by affecting both mn2 oxidation by o2 during photolysis of dom and reductive dissolutions of mn oxide solids by dom we further investigated the effect of the co presence of halide ions on mn2 oxidation here br was chosen as a representative halide ion because we had previously found that although nabr had a 500 fold lower concentration than nacl at the same is more mn2 was oxidized by br radicals generated from nabr than by cl radicals generated from nacl as shown in fig s1 gao et al 2020 2021a in this study more mn oxides were formed in the presence of br compared with that in the absence of br because of reactive br radicals generated by the reactions between dom and br the composition of dom e g humic acid and fulvic acid also affected the photochemical oxidation rates of mn2 aq this new photo assisted pathway involving mn2 aq and dom can help us better understand how mn oxide solids are formed in ubiquitous organic rich surface water systems in addition the discoveries in this study will also provide new insights into the impacts of the reactions between dom and halide ions and their resulting reactive oxygen and halogen species on the oxidation and reduction processes of other transition metal oxides in the environment 2

suwannee river humic acid srha 2s101h and suwannee river fulvic acid srfa 2s101f purchased from the international humic substance society ihss were used to investigate the effect of dom composition on mn2 oxidation the detailed preparation method of their stock solutions and their composition information including quantification of carboxyl and aromatic functional groups are provided in the

membrane was bought from vwr international llc 2 2 photochemical oxidation experiments in a 150 ml quartz reactor batch photochemical experiments for oxidation of mn2 were carried out a 450 w xenon arc lamp newport 6279ns was used for light illumination and its light spectrum in the range from 280 to 600 nm is shown in fig s2 the light was routed through flowing tap water to filter out near infrared light and moderate the reactor temperature 0 1 mm mncl2 was used as the mn source dissolved mn concentrations found in natural waters range from 10 to 10 000 μg l 0 18 μm 0 18 mm who 1999 2004 williams et al 2013 although the mn concentrations employed in this study might be higher than those detected in natural surface waters the findings can help better comprehend a variety of geochemical scenarios to understand the effects of ph on mn2 aq oxidation by photolysis of dom solutions with and without borate buffer were studied for comparison for experimental conditions without borate buffer the solution containing 2 mgc l 2 mg carbon per liter solution dom and 0 1 mm mncl2 was prepared then to compare the effect of initial ph on mn oxidation solution ph was adjusted to 7 0 0 1 8 0 0 1 or 9 0 0 1 by adding naoh solution the experimental ph values are relevant to environmental systems where the water quality guidelines for ph in freshwater set by the us environmental protection agency epa range from 6 5 to 9 0 epa 1986 who 2011 for experimental conditions with borate buffer solution containing 0 1 mm mncl2 srnom and borate buffer was prepared borate buffer solutions with a pka of 9 23 stoll and blanchard 2009 were made by adding naoh into the boric acid solution to reach the desired borate buffer concentrations and ph values ph 9 0 in this study 10 50 and 100 mm borate buffer at ph 9 0 were used to investigate the effects of borate buffer concentration on mn oxidation to investigate the effects of concentration of srnom on mn2 aq oxidation 2 and 10 mgc l of srnom were chosen these concentrations were chosen to mimic environmentally relevant conditions because surface water usually contains 2 10 mgc l dom lapworth et al 2008 nogueira et al 2017 sillanpää 2014 to investigate the effects of dom composition on mn oxidation srnom srha and srfa were used as the dom sources for srnom concentration analyses different concentrations of srnom solutions were used to obtain a linear calibration curve for srnom concentration versus absorbance at 254 nm peuravuori and pihlaja 1997 as shown in fig s3 then to study the generation of br radicals for mn oxidation we added 1 or 10 mm nabr in the systems to determine the corresponding oxidative role of o2 sod was added as the o2 scavenger to simulate sunlight we used an xe arc lamp and the prepared solutions were exposed to the light for 6 h the samples were taken every hour to track the ph of the solution and the amounts of produced mn oxide solids the formed mn oxide solid products were collected via centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 30 min the resulting solid products were then rinsed resuspended in di water and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min the above process was repeated five times to eliminate impurities from the liquid supernatant the solid products were then dried at room temperature for further characterization 2 3 quantification of oxidized mn oxides as previously reported gao et al 2021b jung et al 2017a we quantified the concentrations of formed mn iii mn iv oxide solids by using 0 004 w v lbb specifically lbb reduced the high oxidation states of mn iii or iv in newly formed mn oxide solids to mn2 aq and then displayed a blue color whose uv vis intensity at 625 nm was proportional to the concentration of oxidized mn for lbb analyses different concentrations of kmno4 solutions were used to obtain a linear calibration curve for mn oxide solids concentration versus uv vis absorbance at 625 nm fig s4 mn vii in kmno4 was reduced to mn ii during the redox reaction between kmno4 and lbb thus a five electron transfer for each mn atom was used to obtain the calibration curve between kmno4 concentration and oxidized lbb intensity at 625 nm the calculations of mn oxide concentrations were based on the oxidation states of mn and electron transfer mn iv was reduced to mn ii when mn iv o2 reacted with lbb with a two electron transfer for each mn atom thus a coefficient of 2 5 was added when calculating the mn iv o2 concentration using the kmno4 calibration curve owing to the 2 5 time difference in the electron transfer between mn iv o2 and kmno4 2 4 mn oxides solid phase characterization to experimentally determine the mineral phases of mn oxides samples high resolution x ray diffraction hrxrd bruker d8 advance x ray diffractometer with

initial ph 9 0 without buffer 0 82 μm mn oxide solids based on mn iv oxidation state were detected after 1 h photolysis reaction as measured by the lbb method and shown in the blue curve in fig 1 a because the lbb method cannot distinguish whether the formed oxidized mn came from the solid phase of mn oxides or from aqueous oxidized mn e g mn3 aq a 0 2 μm ptfe membrane was used to filter out the formed solid phases of mn oxides and leave only aqueous oxidized mn in the solution afterwards the filtered aqueous solution was again measured by lbb to check the concentration of aqueous oxidized mn no oxidized mn was observed in the purple curve suggesting that the oxidized mn came only from the solid phase of mn oxides however the amount of mn iv oxides kept decreasing after 1 h and became 0 after a 5 h reaction and the ph value decreased from initial 9 0 to 7 4 after 1 h photochemical reaction fig 1b because dom served as reducing agents for mn oxide solids as shown in fig s5 the ph drops mainly resulted from the photo degradation of dom and the oxidation of mn2 aq compared with co2 dissolution into the solution hence both the reduction of mn oxide solids by dom and the photochemical oxidation of mn2 aq by dom occur simultaneously according to allard et al 2017 when the ph decreased from 7 to 5 the adsorption between dom on mno2 was favored thus the ph decrease in our study might have enhanced the dom adsorption on mn oxide solids and further promoted the kinetics of the reductive dissolution of mn oxide solids moreover the reductive dissolution of mn oxide solids is preferred at lower ph values xyla et al 1992 in addition the decay of o2 becomes faster at lower ph values ma et al 2019 which may inhibit mn oxidation for these reasons the reduction kinetics of mn oxide solids by dom would be faster than that of the photochemical oxidation reaction of mn2 aq after 1 h ph 7 4 resulting in a reductive mn oxide dissolution dominant system after 1 h during the photolysis reaction of 2 mgc l srnom at initial ph 9 0 about 36 of srnom was degraded after 6 h reaction fig 1c in the presence of 0 1 mm mncl2 49 of srnom was degraded after 6 h reaction suggesting that the presence of mncl2 facilitated the photo degradation of srnom although we did not examine effects of light intensity on the photolysis of dom and subsequent mn2 oxidation in this study different light intensities can affect these processes systematic future studies are therefore warranted to better understand the effects of ph on mn oxidation induced by the photolysis of dom the same recipe solution i e 0 1 mm mncl2 and 2 mgc l srnom was made but adjusted at initial ph 8 0 or 7 0 rather than ph 9 0 as shown in fig 1a a very small amount of mn oxides was detected at 15 min ph 7 5 0 1 after 15 min the reduction process of mn oxides by srnom was prevailing because the ph of the solution further decreased the formed mn oxides reductively dissolved to mn2 aq no oxidized mn was observed in the orange curve suggesting that the oxidized mn only came from the solid phase of mn oxides which was the same as initial ph 9 0 condition no mn oxides were detected after 1 h under the condition of initial ph 7 0 no mn oxidation was observed thus the oxidation of mn2 aq by srdom was dominant only when ph was higher than 7 5 0 1 3 2 mn2 oxidation at a controlled ph with buffer we have demonstrated that the net production of mn oxide solids from the reductive dissolution of mn oxide solids by dom and the photochemical oxidation of mn2 aq by dom were affected by the solution ph because the ph values of the surface water generally maintain an overall steady ph borate buffer with ph of 9 0 was used in the rest of this study to mimic environmental relevant conditions as shown in fig 2 a b the quantity of generated mn oxides continuously increased during the photolysis of solution containing 0 1 mm mncl2 2 mgc l srnom and 10 mm borate buffer and the ph is maintained at ph 9 0 after 6 h reaction about 12 3 0 7 μm of mn oxides formed based on mn iv oxidation state during the photochemical oxidation of natural dissolved organic matter 3dom dom oh o2 h2o2 and 1o2 can be generated dalrymple et al 2010 mcneill and canonica 2016 zafiriou 1977 zafiriou et al 1984 as shown in scheme 1a both oxidation of mn2 aq by o2 during the photolysis of dom and reduction of mn oxide solids by dom occurred please note that although dom can act as a scavenger for free radicals such as oh and 1o2 cory et al 2009 vione et al 2006 in this study as a good starting point to understand the system we focus on the net effects of ros on mn oxidation scheme 1b c summarize the detailed generation pathways of the reactive species by either energy transfer or charge electron transfer reactions first dom is excited by photon absorption and transitions to excited singlet state of dom 1dom then 3dom is generated by intersystem crossing from the 1dom step 2 the formed 3dom can react with o2 to form 1o2 via energy transfer step 3 3dom can also be oxidized by o2 and generate o2 step 4 for charge transfer processes dom behaves as an intramolecular charge transfer complex with a diradical character it is produced by direct charge transfer absorbance from dom step 5 as well as intramolecular electron transfer from 1dom and 3dom steps 6 and 7 dom can react with o2 to produce o2 via electron transfer step 8 moreover oh can be formed through oxidation of h2o by 3dom step 9 as well as through the chain reactions from o2 to h2o2 and from h2o2 to oh step 10 these reactive intermediates can potentially effect mn2 oxidation we have systematically proved that oh radicals contribute little to mn oxide formation gao et al 2021b in the presence of the oh scavenger tert butyl alcohol mn2 oxidation during nitrate photolysis was promoted rather than inhibited demonstrating that oh radicals played a little role in oxidizing mn2 gao et al 2021b in the presence of sod an o2 scavenger mn2 oxidation during nitrate photolysis was not observed proving that o2 radicals were mainly responsible for mn2 oxidation gao et al 2021b jung et al 2017a the reason might be that oh radicals have a much shorter diffusion length and half life nanoseconds compared with o2 seconds krumova and cosa 2016 levy et al 2019 as for other ros h2o2 was considered as a reductant rather than an oxidant for mn oxide solids godwin et al 2020 nico et al 2002 reported the oxidation of mn2 aq to mn iii by o2 and 1o2 from photolysis of humic substances however only 4 of the formed mn iii came from 1o2 while the rest came from o2 nico et al 2002 thus in this study we hypothesized that o2 were the main oxidants responsible for mn2 oxidation to confirm the hypothesis sod was used as the specific scavenger of o2 to determine the corresponding role of o2 using our previous methodology gao et al 2021b jung et al 2017a during the photolysis of the solution containing 0 1 mm mncl2 2 mgc l srnom and 10 mm borate buffer by adding 0 5 μm sod mn oxidation was not observed as shown in fig 2a in fig s6 no mn oxidation was observed during the photolysis of a solution containing 0 1 mm mncl2 and 10 mm borate buffer indicating that borate buffer did not oxidize mn2 aq and the oxidized mn resulted from the photolysis of srnom the results proved that o2 radicals were mainly responsible for mn oxidation among all ros which is similar with biotic mn oxidation by extracellular o2 radicals diaz et al 2013 hansel et al 2012 learman et al 2011a 2011b during the photochemical oxidation of mn2 aq to mn iv oxide solids mn3 aq can form as an intermediate product jung et al 2017a the mn3 aq is favored to interact with strong ligands to form stable complexation oldham et al 2017 and borate buffer might complex with mn3 aq in our previous study we found pyrophosphate buffer can complex with mn3 aq and affect mn oxidation processes jung et al 2017b to test the existence of oxidized mn3 aq in the solution 0 2 μm ptfe membrane was used to filter out the formed mn oxide solids as shown in fig s7 no oxidized mn in the solution was detected after solid phases of oxidized mn were removed validating the hypothesis that the oxidized mn in lbb measurements are mn oxide solids thus complexation between borate buffer and mn3 aq would not be significant or exist in addition nico et al 2002 stated that borate did not complex with mn2 aq however it is still possible that borate may affect mn oxidation kinetics by complexing with dom or degraded products of dom to investigate the effects of borate buffer concentration on mn oxidation we have tested the mn oxidation with 50 or 100 mm borate buffers at ph 9 0 as shown in fig s8 less mn oxidation was observed with higher concentrations of borate buffer while the ph remained overall steady between 8 5 and 9 0 during the 6 h photochemical reactions for all conditions previously borate was found to form covalent complexes with mono and oligosaccharides nucleic acid ribose moieties pyridine nucleotides and other gem diols stoll and blanchard 2009 thus although borate buffer had low affinity to complex with aqueous mn it may favorably form complexes with dom or degraded product of dom during the photolysis affecting the kinetics of generation of reactive oxidative intermediate species and further affecting mn oxidation to minimize the effect of borate buffer concentration on mn oxidation the concentration of borate buffer was fixed 10 mm in this study 3 3 determination of mn oxide solids formed by dom photolysis high resolution x ray diffraction measurements were used to characterize the crystalline phases of mn oxides formed by photolysis of a solution containing 0 1 mm mncl2 2 mgc l srnom and 10 mm borate buffer at ph about 9 0 for 6 h reaction as shown in fig 2c 2θ peak value of 18 9 indicated that λ mno2 icdd pdf 4 00 044 0992 had formed a tiny xrd peak at a 2θ of 28 3 suggested that pyrolusite β mno2 icdd pdf 4 00 004 0591 had formed moreover a broad xrd peak at a 2θ of 12 4 suggested the crystalline phase δ mno2 icdd pdf 4 00 043 1456 on the other hand α mno2 icdd pdf 4 00 042 1348 has characteristic peaks at 2θ values of both 12 8 and 28 9 which closely correspond to the peaks of the measured sample thus the measured sample can contain α mno2 as well dom is a complex matrix containing various components which possibly led to the formation of diverse crystalline phases of mn oxides during photolysis of dom the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps image in fig 2d suggested that formed solid mn oxides contain 82 8 mn iv and 15 5 mn iii with a very small fraction 1 7 of mn ii resulting in an average oxidation state of 3 81 which is slightly higher than that of δ mno2 generated from nitrate photolysis 3 73 gao et al 2021b because mn average oxidation state was lower than 4 in the xps results the actual concentrations of mn oxide solids could be slightly higher than the values measured by lbb method in fig 2a as shown in fig 3 a b a three dimensional structure of the mn oxides was obtained in haadf stem images both flake and rod morphologies of mn oxides were observed the stem edx spectra and elemental mapping of mn and o in fig 3c e collected from fig 3b confirmed the formation of mn oxides in the selected area electron diffraction saed patterns in fig 3f the ring pattern with a d spacing of 0 47 nm indicated the 111 plane of λ mno2 in addition the ring pattern with a d spacing of 0 31 nm suggested the 110 plane of β mno2 or the 310 plane of α mno2 the 001 plane of δ mno2 although detected by xrd was not observed by saed because it was too close to the bright beam center compared with the δ mno2 nanosheets formed by nitrate photolysis fig s9 that we previously observed gao et al 2021b jung et al 2017a different crystalline structures oxidation states and morphologies of mn oxides were formed by the photolysis of dom which may result from the variance of the chemical environments for mn oxidation 3 4 effects of dom concentration and bromide ions on mn2 oxidation theoretically the higher concentration of dom the more o2 will be generated which promotes the oxidation of mn2 aq however the reduction of mn oxide solids by dom will also be enhanced with a higher dom concentration it is unclear which process is dominant with different dom concentrations the dom concentration in the surface water usually ranges from 2 to 10 mgc l lapworth et al 2008 nogueira et al 2017 sillanpää 2014 in this study both 2 and 10 mgc l of dom were utilized to study the effects of dom concentration on mn oxidation at ph 9 0 as shown in fig 4 2 mgc l srnom orange curve system formed 12 3 μm of mn oxide solids based on mn iv oxidation state after 6 h reaction while 10 mgc l srnom red curve formed 26 0 μm of mn oxide solids indicating the oxidation of mn2 aq is prevailing with a higher dom concentration at ph 9 0 in addition the effects of dom on mn2 oxidation were investigated in the presence of br halide ions are ubiquitous in natural and engineered environments in our previous study gao et al 2020 2021a we investigated the different contributions of cl and br radicals to mn2 oxidation in that study 500 mm nacl and 1 mm nabr were investigated as a representative for cl and br respectively gao et al 2020 2021a despite the fact that nabr had a 500 fold lower concentration than nacl at the same ionic strength br radicals generated by nabr oxidized more mn2 than cl radicals generated by nacl as shown in fig s1 gao et al 2020 2021a thus only bromide ions were investigated and cl ions were not included in this study for this test we used 1 and 10 mm nabr to study the effect of dom and bromide ions on the photochemical mn oxidation process these concentrations were chosen to mimic environmentally relevant conditions the concentration of br greatly increases in the surface water that receives large amounts of concentrated flowback efflux in unconventional oil and gas recovery gregory et al 2011 br concentrations can reach about 1 8 g l 22 5 mm in marcellus and fayetteville hydraulic fracturing flowback fluids 1 g l 12 5 mm in effluents from pennsylvania brine treatment sites and 40 mg l 0 5 mm in contaminated surface waters from effluent disposal sites harkness et al 2015 as shown in fig 3d oh can oxidize br to form reactive br radicals step 12 in addition 3dom can directly oxidize br to form reactive br radicals step 11 fig 4a shows mn oxidation in the presence of additional 1 mm nabr blue curve the mn oxidation amount was slightly higher than that in the condition without bromide orange curve because of the formation of reactive br radicals when increasing the concentration of nabr from 1 to 10 mm green curve mn oxidation was further enhanced however compared with increasing nabr concentration mn oxidation kinetics was greatly promoted with the increment of srnom concentration when the concentration of srnom increased from 2 to 10 mgc l and in the presence of 10 mm nabr black curve the mn oxidation amount almost doubled increasing from 18 0 to 32 7 μm after 6 h reaction which resulted from more generation of both o2 and reactive br radicals under the condition of higher srnom concentration the ph values for all conditions remained between 8 5 and 9 0 during the reaction fig 4b 3 5 effects of dom composition on mn2 oxidation because dom is a mixture of humic substances containing carboxyl and aromatic functional groups it is important to understand the effects of the dom composition on mn2 oxidation the composition of dom was found to affect its photochemically produced reactive intermediates berg et al 2019 bodhipaksha et al 2015 maizel and remucal 2017 the generation of 3dom and 1o2 was found to be most significantly connected with more saturated chemical forms of microbially generated dom maizel et al 2017 mccabe and arnold 2017 to investigate the effects of dom composition on mn oxidation srnom srha and srfa were used as shown in table s1 the quantity of the carboxyl functional group decreases in the following order srnom srfa srha on the other hand the aromatic functional group decreases as follows srha srfa srnom driver and perdue 2014 ritchie and perdue 2003 during the photolysis of solutions containing 0 1 mm mncl2 10 mm borate buffer and 10 mgc l srha srfa or srnom the quantity of generated mn oxides decreased as srha srfa srnom as shown in fig 4a berg et al 2019 reported that a larger amount of oh was generated from aromatic and oxygenated dom while a smaller amount of 3dom and 1o2 were measured indicating that dom with greater amounts of aromatic functional groups promotes the charge transfer process berg et al 2019 as shown in fig 4c in addition compared with 3dom energy transfer dom charge transfer is dominant in o2 production le roux et al 2021 ma et al 2020 zhang and blough 2016 thus humic acid with a higher amount of aromatic functional groups than fulvic acid generated more o2 resulting in more mn oxidation as represented in fig 4a because ph did not change much during the mn oxidation fig 4b we excluded the possibility of ph variance as an explanation for the difference in the extent of mn oxidation 4 conclusions in this study we explored the abiotic mn oxidation pathways by examining the roles of dom and bromide ions in mn photochemical oxidation dom can act as an oxidative agent for mn2 aq oxidation processes during photolysis by producing o2 we found the solution ph influenced the formation of mn oxide solids during the photolysis of dom the oxidation processes were dominant at relatively high ph ph 7 5 0 1 however when ph became lower ph 7 5 0 1 reductive dissolution of mn oxide solids to mn2 aq was more favored when ph was maintained at 9 0 by ph buffer the generation of mn oxide solids kept increasing because the complex and various components of dom affected the mn oxidation processes various crystalline structures of mn oxide solids were observed which provides an improved understanding of diversity of natural mn oxide solids furthermore this study enables a deeper understanding of the impacts of br and reactive br radicals on photochemical mn oxidation processes in the presence of organic matter in the addition of br br radicals can be formed which further promoted mn oxidation the coeffect of br and natural organic compounds on mn oxidation in this study emphasizes the unforeseen impact of reactive oxygen and halogen radicals and predicts their reactions with heavy metal ions e g fe2 as3

15644,manganese mn oxide solids are ubiquitous in nature acting as both electron donors and acceptors in diverse redox reactions in the environment reactions of mn iii iv oxides with dissolved natural organic matter dom are commonly described as reductive dissolutions that generate mn2 aq in this study we investigated the role of photochemical reactions of dom in mn2 aq oxidation and the resulting formation of mn oxide solids during the photolysis of dom reactive intermediates can be generated including excited triplet state dom 3dom hydroxyl radicals oh superoxide radicals o2 hydrogen peroxide and singlet oxygen among these we found that o2 radicals were mainly responsible for mn oxidation the solution ph controlled the formation of mn oxide solids by affecting both mn2 oxidation by o2 during photolysis of dom and reductive dissolutions of mn oxide solids by dom further with the addition of bromide ions br reactions between 3dom and br together with reactions between oh and br can form reactive bromide radicals the formed br radicals also promoted mn oxide formation in dom with more aromatic functional groups more mn2 was oxidized to mn oxide solids this enhanced oxidation could be the result of promoted pathways from charge transfer state dom dom to o2 these new observations advance our understanding of natural mn2 oxidation and mn iii iv oxide formation and highlight the underappreciated oxidative roles of dom in the oxidation of metal ions in surface water illuminated by sunlight graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords abiotic manganese oxidation natural organic matter reactive oxygen species bromide radicals photochemistry data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction manganese mn is the second most abundant transition metal in the earth s crust and is found widely in aquatic and terrestrial environments butterfield et al 2013 mn has diverse oxidation states most prevalently mn ii mn iii and mn iv and its oxides have high reduction potential mno2 mn2 1 23 v stumm and morgan 1996 in addition mn oxide solids are effective scavengers of redox active species and heavy metals in nature because they can operate as both electron donors and acceptors and thus play important roles in geochemical element redox cycling carbon mineralization and biological metabolisms butterfield et al 2013 myers and nealson 1988 tebo et al 2004 in nature most mn hydr oxide solids occur in the mn iii and mn iv oxidation states formed by the oxidation of mn2 regarding the formation of mn hydr oxide solids previously the biotic mn oxidation process was believed to be the dominant oxidative pathway from mn2 aq to mn iv oxide solids in natural systems because bacteria and fungi accelerate this process by several orders of magnitude compared to abiotic processes diaz et al 2013 hansel and francis 2006 hansel et al 2012 learman et al 2011a 2011b on the other hand abiotic inorganic oxidation of mn2 aq to mn iv oxide solids has not been considered as a major pathway owing to its slow and kinetically controlled process a half life of 200 300 days huang et al 1995 recently we discovered fast abiotic oxidation of mn2 to mn iv by superoxide radicals o2 generated from nitrate photolysis jung et al 2017a at a rate comparable to biotic processes francis and tebo 2001 hansel and francis 2006 learman et al 2011a 2011b accompanied by the formation of δ mno2 nanosheets jung et al 2017a this new finding demonstrates that abiotic inorganic mn oxidation and solids formation are as important as the biotic process the redox active mn oxide solids can react with dissolved organic matter dom which is a complex matrix of organic matter that are ubiquitous in natural aquatic environments dom contains humic substances such as humic acids ha and fulvic acids fa with aromatic and carboxylic functional groups gaffney et al 1996 surface water usually contains 2 10 mgc l as dissolved organic carbon dom lapworth et al 2008 nogueira et al 2017 sillanpää 2014 studies thus far have extensively investigated the adsorption of dom on mn oxides and the reduction reactions of solid mn oxides by dom the dom adsorption on mn oxides was shown to increase with decreasing ph via surface complexation and ligand exchange allard et al 2017 tipping and heaton 1983 in addition enhanced adsorption of dom on the mn oxide solids was observed in the presence of ca2 by decreasing the electrostatic repulsion tipping and heaton 1983 furthermore the adsorption of dom on mn oxide solids was promoted by higher molecular weight molecules and higher hydrophobicity with more aromatic moieties of dom that were isolated from the suwannee river in usa the jau river in brazil and the loire river in france allard et al 2017 on the other hand mn oxide solids can oxidize dom while dom is degraded into small organic matter allard et al 2017 chorover and amistadi 2001 sunda and kieber 1994 dom can also affect the reactions between mn oxides with organic pollutants such as triclosan and chlorophene in surface water because dom can competitively adsorb on and react with mno2 zhang and huang 2003 moreover sunlight illumination accelerated the reduction of mn oxide solids by dom bertino and zepp 1991 so far most studies have considered dom to be a reducing agent for mn oxide solids rather than an oxidative source for mn2 oxidation processes however dom can behave as oxidative agents in surface water with sunlight illumination sunlight driven processes can initiate the degradation of dom accompanied by the formation of photochemically produced reactive intermediates such as excited triplet state dom 3dom o2 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 hydroxyl radicals oh and singlet oxygen 1o2 dalrymple et al 2010 mcneill and canonica 2016 zafiriou 1977 zafiriou et al 1984 then the generated reactive intermediates can trigger the formation of other reactive radicals for example reactive halogen species can be generated by reactions between 3dom and halide ions brigante et al 2014 de laurentiis et al 2012 jammoul et al 2009 parker and mitch 2016 and by reactions between oh and halide ions mopper and zhou 1990 neta et al 1988 this coeffect with halide ions is important because halide ions are abundant in the surface water and engineered environments specifically the surface water receives large amounts of concentrated flowback efflux that contain concentrated halide ions in desalination processes voutchkov 2011 zhang et al 2021 and in unconventional oil and gas recovery through hydraulic fracturing gregory et al 2011 large amounts of soluble organic constituents for example 2 butoxyethanol and pyridine were also produced in the flowback fracturing water butkovskyi et al 2017 gregory et al 2011 these effluents are discharged onto the surface and impounded before further treatment and reuse gregory et al 2011 voutchkov 2011 zhang et al 2021 in an ongoing investigation of abiotic mn oxidation by natural abundant radicals we have discovered the photochemical oxidation of mn2 aq by reactive halogen radicals mainly from bromide br radicals br and br2 gao et al 2020 2021a the reactive halogen radicals were generated from nitrate photolysis in the presence of naturally abundant halide ions which facilitated the oxidation of mn2 aq to δ mno2 nanosheets similarly the photolysis of dom in the presence of halide ions can be an alternative and significant pathway to generate reactive oxygen and halogen radicals for inorganic mn oxidation however there is no previous study that examines the impacts of their coexistence on mn oxidation and resulting formation of mn oxide solids previously reactive oxygen species ros and 3dom generated from photolysis of dom have been highlighted as oxidative agents mainly for organic compounds for example ros and 3dom can oxidize organic contaminants such as amine drugs mexiletine propranolol and diphenhydramine and antibiotics sulfadimethoxine chen et al 2009 guerard et al 2009 however when it came to the interactions with inorganic ions such as heavy or transition metal ions dom was typically thought to function as chelating agent allard et al 2017 cabaniss 2011 pan et al 2018 soluble mn3 species were found to be stabilized by dom and formed mn iii dom colloids li et al 2019 trouwborst et al 2006 although a previous study showed the photochemical oxidation of mn2 aq to mn oxides by humic substances and built a kinetic model to fit the experimental results nico et al 2002 information regarding mn oxidation state crystalline phase and morphology of the formed mn oxides is still unknown moreover although sodium chloride was included in the previous work nico et al 2002 the roles of generated chloride cl radicals in mn oxidation were not considered thus further study is required to fully comprehend the oxidative roles of dom in photolytic reactions with mn2 in particular we need to examine the coeffect of reactive oxygen and halogen species generated from the reactions between dom and halide ions on mn2 oxidation processes this information will help us better understand the formation of mn oxide minerals in organic environments to examine the underappreciated roles of dom in mn oxidation in the natural and engineered water this study aims to investigate the photochemical oxidation of mn2 aq in the presence of dom and halide ions both reduction reaction of mn oxide solids by dom and oxidation reaction of mn2 aq to mn oxide solids by photolysis of dom can occur at the same time hence the results here report the net reaction of the reduction and oxidation processes we found that solution ph significantly impacted the formation of mn oxide solids by affecting both mn2 oxidation by o2 during photolysis of dom and reductive dissolutions of mn oxide solids by dom we further investigated the effect of the co presence of halide ions on mn2 oxidation here br was chosen as a representative halide ion because we had previously found that although nabr had a 500 fold lower concentration than nacl at the same is more mn2 was oxidized by br radicals generated from nabr than by cl radicals generated from nacl as shown in fig s1 gao et al 2020 2021a in this study more mn oxides were formed in the presence of br compared with that in the absence of br because of reactive br radicals generated by the reactions between dom and br the composition of dom e g humic acid and fulvic acid also affected the photochemical oxidation rates of mn2 aq this new photo assisted pathway involving mn2 aq and dom can help us better understand how mn oxide solids are formed in ubiquitous organic rich surface water systems in addition the discoveries in this study will also provide new insights into the impacts of the reactions between dom and halide ions and their resulting reactive oxygen and halogen species on the oxidation and reduction processes of other transition metal oxides in the environment 2

geochemical scenarios to understand the effects of ph on mn2 aq oxidation by photolysis of dom solutions with and without borate buffer were studied for comparison for experimental conditions without borate buffer the solution containing 2 mgc l 2 mg carbon per liter solution dom and 0 1 mm mncl2 was prepared then to compare the effect of initial ph on mn oxidation solution ph was adjusted to 7 0

for mn oxidation we added 1 or 10 mm nabr in the systems to determine the corresponding oxidative role of o2 sod was added as the o2 scavenger to simulate sunlight we used an xe arc lamp and the prepared solutions were exposed to the light for 6 h the samples were taken every hour to track the ph of the solution and the amounts of produced mn oxide solids the formed mn oxide solid products were collected via centrifugation at 10 000 rpm for 30 min the resulting solid products were then rinsed resuspended in di water and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min the above process was repeated five times to eliminate impurities from the liquid supernatant the solid products were then dried at room temperature for further characterization 2 3 quantification of oxidized mn oxides as previously reported gao et al 2021b jung et al 2017a we quantified the concentrations of formed mn iii mn iv oxide solids by using 0 004 w v lbb specifically lbb reduced the high oxidation states of mn iii or iv in newly formed mn oxide solids to mn2 aq and then displayed a blue color whose uv vis intensity at 625 nm was proportional to the concentration of oxidized mn for lbb analyses different concentrations of kmno4 solutions were used to obtain a linear calibration curve for mn oxide solids concentration versus uv vis absorbance at 625 nm fig s4 mn vii in kmno4 was reduced to mn ii during the redox reaction between kmno4 and lbb thus a five electron transfer for each mn atom was used to obtain the calibration curve between kmno4 concentration and oxidized lbb intensity at 625 nm the calculations of mn oxide concentrations were based on the oxidation states of mn and electron transfer mn iv was reduced to mn ii when mn iv o2 reacted with lbb with a two electron transfer for each mn atom thus a coefficient of 2 5 was added when calculating the mn iv o2 concentration using the kmno4 calibration curve owing to the 2 5 time difference in the electron transfer between mn iv o2 and kmno4 2 4 mn oxides solid phase characterization to experimentally determine the mineral phases of mn oxides samples high resolution x ray diffraction hrxrd bruker d8 advance x ray diffractometer with cu kα radiation λ 1 5418 å was utilized mn oxidation states in the mn oxides samples were characterized by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps phi 5000 versaprobe ii ulvacphi with monochromatic al kα radiation 1486 6 ev the c 1s peak 284 8 ev was employed as the reference peak to determine the ratio of mn ii mn iii and mn iv in the generated mn oxide solids the mn 2p3 2 spin orbit was deconvoluted by mn ii 640 8 ev mn iii 641 8 ev and mn iv 642 2 ev by the gauss lorentz fitting method based on previously reported values of the mn 2p3 2 spectrum jung et al 2017b sources for the fitting reference values of mn ii mn iii and mn iv are listed in table s2 to determine the crystalline phases and to image the morphologies of formed mn oxide solids high resolution transmission electron microscopy hr tem jeol 2100f was used to prepare hr tem samples after the photochemical reactions several droplets of formed mn oxide solution were placed on continuous ultrathin lacey carbon film coated cu grids lc400 cu cc 25 electron microscopy science pa high angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy haadf stem was used to observe the three dimensional morphology and to conduct element mapping for the formed mn oxide solids 3 results and discussion 3 1 photochemical oxidation of mn2 aq by srnom during the photolysis of a solution containing 0 1 mm mncl2 and 2 mgc l srnom at initial ph 9 0 without buffer 0 82 μm mn oxide solids based on mn iv oxidation state were detected after 1 h photolysis reaction as measured by the lbb method and shown in the blue curve in fig 1 a because the lbb method cannot distinguish whether the formed oxidized mn came from the solid phase of mn oxides or from aqueous oxidized mn e g mn3 aq a 0 2 μm ptfe membrane was used to filter out the formed solid phases of mn oxides and leave only aqueous oxidized mn in the solution afterwards the filtered aqueous solution was again measured by lbb to check the concentration of aqueous oxidized mn no oxidized mn was observed in the purple curve suggesting that the oxidized mn came only from the solid phase of mn oxides however the amount of mn iv oxides kept decreasing after 1 h and became 0 after a 5 h reaction and the ph value decreased from initial 9 0 to 7 4 after 1 h photochemical reaction fig 1b because dom served as reducing agents for mn oxide solids as shown in fig s5 the ph drops mainly resulted from the photo degradation of dom and the oxidation of mn2 aq compared with co2 dissolution into the solution hence both the reduction of mn oxide solids by dom and the photochemical oxidation of mn2 aq by dom occur simultaneously according to allard et al 2017 when the ph decreased from 7 to 5 the adsorption between dom on mno2 was favored thus the ph decrease in our study might have enhanced the dom adsorption on mn oxide solids and further promoted the kinetics of the reductive dissolution of mn oxide solids moreover the reductive dissolution of mn oxide solids is preferred at lower ph values xyla et al 1992 in addition the decay of o2 becomes faster at lower ph values ma et al 2019 which may inhibit mn oxidation for these reasons the reduction kinetics of mn oxide solids by dom would be faster than that of the photochemical oxidation reaction of mn2 aq after 1 h ph 7 4 resulting in a reductive mn oxide dissolution dominant system after 1 h during the photolysis reaction of 2 mgc l srnom at initial ph 9 0 about 36 of srnom was degraded after 6 h reaction fig 1c in the presence of 0 1 mm mncl2 49 of srnom was degraded after 6 h reaction suggesting that the presence of mncl2 facilitated the photo degradation of srnom although we did not examine effects of light intensity on the photolysis of dom and subsequent mn2 oxidation in this study different light intensities can affect these processes systematic future studies are therefore warranted to better understand the effects of ph on mn oxidation induced by the photolysis of dom the same recipe solution i e 0 1 mm mncl2 and 2 mgc l srnom was made but adjusted at initial ph 8 0 or 7 0 rather than ph 9 0 as shown in fig 1a a very small amount of mn oxides was detected at 15 min ph 7 5 0 1 after 15 min the reduction process of mn oxides by srnom was prevailing because the ph of the solution further decreased the formed mn oxides reductively dissolved to mn2 aq no oxidized mn was observed in the orange curve suggesting that the oxidized mn only came from the solid phase of mn oxides which was the same as initial ph 9 0 condition no mn oxides were detected after 1 h under the condition of initial ph 7 0 no mn oxidation was observed thus the oxidation of mn2 aq by srdom was dominant only when ph was higher than 7 5 0 1 3 2 mn2 oxidation at a controlled ph with buffer we have demonstrated that the net production of mn oxide solids from the reductive dissolution of mn oxide solids by dom and the photochemical oxidation of mn2 aq by dom were affected by the solution ph because the ph values of the surface water generally maintain an overall steady ph borate buffer with ph of 9 0 was used in the rest of this study to mimic environmental relevant conditions as shown in fig 2 a b the quantity of generated mn oxides continuously increased during the photolysis of solution containing 0 1 mm mncl2 2 mgc l srnom and 10 mm borate buffer and the ph is maintained at ph 9 0 after 6 h reaction about 12 3 0 7 μm of mn oxides formed based on mn iv oxidation state during the photochemical oxidation of natural dissolved organic matter 3dom dom oh o2 h2o2 and 1o2 can be generated dalrymple et al 2010 mcneill and canonica 2016 zafiriou 1977 zafiriou et al 1984 as shown in scheme 1a both oxidation of mn2 aq by o2 during the photolysis of dom and reduction of mn oxide solids by dom occurred please note that although dom can act as a scavenger for free radicals such as oh and 1o2 cory et al 2009 vione et al 2006 in this study as a good starting point to understand the system we focus on the net effects of ros on mn oxidation scheme 1b c summarize the detailed generation pathways of the reactive species by either energy transfer or charge electron transfer reactions first dom is excited by photon absorption and transitions to excited singlet state of dom 1dom then 3dom is generated by intersystem crossing from the 1dom step 2 the formed 3dom can react with o2 to form 1o2 via energy transfer step 3 3dom can also be oxidized by o2 and generate o2 step 4 for charge transfer processes dom behaves as an intramolecular charge transfer complex with a diradical character it is produced by direct charge transfer absorbance from dom step 5 as well as intramolecular electron transfer from 1dom and 3dom steps 6 and 7 dom can react with o2 to produce o2 via electron transfer step 8 moreover oh can be formed through oxidation of h2o by 3dom step 9 as well as through the chain reactions from o2 to h2o2 and from h2o2 to oh step 10 these reactive intermediates can potentially effect mn2 oxidation we have systematically proved that oh radicals contribute little to mn oxide formation gao et al 2021b in the presence of the oh scavenger tert butyl alcohol mn2 oxidation during nitrate photolysis was promoted rather than inhibited demonstrating that oh radicals played a little role in oxidizing mn2 gao et al 2021b in the presence of sod an o2 scavenger mn2 oxidation during nitrate photolysis was not observed proving that o2 radicals were mainly responsible for mn2 oxidation gao et al 2021b jung et al 2017a the reason might be that oh radicals have a much shorter diffusion length and half life nanoseconds compared with o2 seconds krumova and cosa 2016 levy et al 2019 as for other ros h2o2 was considered as a reductant rather than an oxidant for mn oxide solids godwin et al 2020 nico et al 2002 reported the oxidation of mn2 aq to mn iii by o2 and 1o2 from photolysis of humic substances however only 4 of the formed mn iii came from 1o2 while the rest came from o2 nico et al 2002 thus in this study we hypothesized that o2 were the main oxidants responsible for mn2 oxidation to confirm the hypothesis sod was used as the specific scavenger of o2 to determine the corresponding role of o2 using our previous methodology gao et al 2021b jung et al 2017a during the photolysis of the solution containing 0 1 mm mncl2 2 mgc l srnom and 10 mm borate buffer by adding 0 5 μm sod mn oxidation was not observed as shown in fig 2a in fig s6 no mn oxidation was observed during the photolysis of a solution containing 0 1 mm mncl2 and 10 mm borate buffer indicating that borate buffer did not oxidize mn2 aq and the oxidized mn resulted from the photolysis of srnom the results proved that o2 radicals were mainly responsible for mn oxidation among all ros which is similar with biotic mn oxidation by extracellular o2 radicals diaz et al 2013 hansel et al 2012 learman et al 2011a 2011b during the photochemical oxidation of mn2 aq to mn iv oxide solids mn3 aq can form as an intermediate product jung et al 2017a the mn3 aq is favored to interact with strong ligands to form stable complexation oldham et al 2017 and borate buffer might complex with mn3 aq in our previous study we found pyrophosphate buffer can complex with mn3 aq and affect mn oxidation processes jung et al 2017b to test the existence of oxidized mn3 aq in the solution 0 2 μm ptfe membrane was used to filter out the formed mn oxide solids as shown in fig s7 no oxidized mn in the solution was detected after solid phases of oxidized mn were removed validating the hypothesis that the oxidized mn in lbb measurements are mn oxide solids thus complexation between borate buffer and mn3 aq would not be significant or exist in addition nico et al 2002 stated that borate did not complex with mn2 aq however it is still possible that borate may affect mn oxidation kinetics by complexing with dom or degraded products of dom to investigate the effects of borate buffer concentration on mn oxidation we have tested the mn oxidation with 50 or 100 mm borate buffers at ph 9 0 as shown in fig s8 less mn oxidation was observed with higher concentrations of borate buffer while the ph remained overall steady between 8 5 and 9 0 during the 6 h photochemical reactions for all conditions previously borate was found to form covalent complexes with mono and oligosaccharides nucleic acid ribose moieties pyridine nucleotides and other gem diols stoll and blanchard 2009 thus although borate buffer had low affinity to complex with aqueous mn it may favorably form complexes with dom or degraded product of dom during the photolysis affecting the kinetics of generation of reactive oxidative intermediate species and further affecting mn oxidation to minimize the effect of borate buffer concentration on mn oxidation the concentration of borate buffer was fixed 10 mm in this study 3 3 determination of mn oxide solids formed by dom photolysis high resolution x ray diffraction measurements were used to characterize the crystalline phases of mn oxides formed by photolysis of a solution containing 0 1 mm mncl2 2 mgc l srnom and 10 mm borate buffer at ph about 9 0 for 6 h reaction as shown in fig 2c 2θ peak value of 18 9 indicated that λ mno2 icdd pdf 4 00 044 0992 had formed a tiny xrd peak at a 2θ of 28 3 suggested that pyrolusite β mno2 icdd pdf 4 00 004 0591 had formed moreover a broad xrd peak at a 2θ of 12 4 suggested the crystalline phase δ mno2 icdd pdf 4 00 043 1456 on the other hand α mno2 icdd pdf 4 00 042 1348 has characteristic peaks at 2θ values of both 12 8 and 28 9 which closely correspond to the peaks of the measured sample thus the measured sample can contain α mno2 as well dom is a complex matrix containing various components which possibly led to the formation of diverse crystalline phases of mn oxides during photolysis of dom the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps image in fig 2d suggested that formed solid mn oxides contain 82 8 mn iv and 15 5 mn iii with a very small fraction 1 7 of mn ii resulting in an average oxidation state of 3 81 which is slightly higher than that of δ mno2 generated from nitrate photolysis 3 73 gao et al 2021b because mn average oxidation state was lower than 4 in the xps results the actual concentrations of mn oxide solids could be slightly higher than the values measured by lbb method in fig 2a as shown in fig 3 a b a three dimensional structure of the mn oxides was obtained in haadf stem images both flake and rod morphologies of mn oxides were observed the stem edx spectra and elemental mapping of mn and o in fig 3c e collected from fig 3b confirmed the formation of mn oxides in the selected area electron diffraction saed patterns in fig 3f the ring pattern with a d spacing of 0 47 nm indicated the 111 plane of λ mno2 in addition the ring pattern with a d spacing of 0 31 nm suggested the 110 plane of β mno2 or the 310 plane of α mno2 the 001 plane of δ mno2 although detected by xrd was not observed by saed because it was too close to the bright beam center compared with the δ mno2 nanosheets formed by nitrate photolysis fig s9 that we previously observed gao et al 2021b jung et al 2017a different crystalline structures oxidation states and morphologies of mn oxides were formed by the photolysis of dom which may result from the variance of the chemical environments for mn oxidation 3 4 effects of dom concentration and bromide ions on mn2 oxidation theoretically the higher concentration of dom the more o2 will be generated which promotes the oxidation of mn2 aq however the reduction of mn oxide solids by dom will also be enhanced with a higher dom concentration it is unclear which process is dominant with different dom concentrations the dom concentration in the surface water usually ranges from 2 to 10 mgc l lapworth et al 2008 nogueira et al 2017 sillanpää 2014 in this study both 2 and 10 mgc l of dom were utilized to study the effects of dom concentration on mn oxidation at ph 9 0 as shown in fig 4 2 mgc l srnom orange curve system formed 12 3 μm of mn oxide solids based on mn iv oxidation state after 6 h reaction while 10 mgc l srnom red curve formed 26 0 μm of mn oxide solids indicating the oxidation of mn2 aq is prevailing with a higher dom concentration at ph 9 0 in addition the effects of dom on mn2 oxidation were investigated in the presence of br halide ions are ubiquitous in natural and engineered environments in our previous study gao et al 2020 2021a we investigated the different contributions of cl and br radicals to mn2 oxidation in that study 500 mm nacl and 1 mm nabr were investigated as a representative for cl and br respectively gao et al 2020 2021a despite the fact that nabr had a 500 fold lower concentration than nacl at the same ionic strength br radicals generated by nabr oxidized more mn2 than cl radicals generated by nacl as shown in fig s1 gao et al 2020 2021a thus only bromide ions were investigated and cl ions were not included in this study for this test we used 1 and 10 mm nabr to study the effect of dom and bromide ions on the photochemical mn oxidation process these concentrations were chosen to mimic environmentally relevant conditions the concentration of br greatly increases in the surface water that receives large amounts of concentrated flowback efflux in unconventional oil and gas recovery gregory et al 2011 br concentrations can reach about 1 8 g l 22 5 mm in marcellus and fayetteville hydraulic fracturing flowback fluids 1 g l 12 5 mm in effluents from pennsylvania brine treatment sites and 40 mg l 0 5 mm in contaminated surface waters from effluent disposal sites harkness et al 2015 as shown in fig 3d oh can oxidize br to form reactive br radicals step 12 in addition 3dom can directly oxidize br to form reactive br radicals step 11 fig 4a shows mn oxidation in the presence of additional 1 mm nabr blue curve the mn oxidation amount was slightly higher than that in the condition without bromide orange curve because of the formation of reactive br radicals when increasing the concentration of nabr from 1 to 10 mm green curve mn oxidation was further enhanced however compared with increasing nabr concentration mn oxidation kinetics was greatly promoted with the increment of srnom concentration when the concentration of srnom increased from 2 to 10 mgc l and in the presence of 10 mm nabr black curve the mn oxidation amount almost doubled increasing from 18 0 to 32 7 μm after 6 h reaction which resulted from more generation of both o2 and reactive br radicals under the condition of higher srnom concentration the ph values for all conditions remained between 8 5 and 9 0 during the reaction fig 4b 3 5 effects of dom composition on mn2 oxidation because dom is a mixture of humic substances containing carboxyl and aromatic functional groups it is important to understand the effects of the dom composition on mn2 oxidation the composition of dom was found to affect its photochemically produced reactive intermediates berg et al 2019 bodhipaksha et al 2015 maizel and remucal 2017 the generation of 3dom and 1o2 was found to be most significantly connected with more saturated chemical forms of microbially generated dom maizel et al 2017 mccabe and arnold 2017 to investigate the effects of dom composition on mn oxidation srnom srha and srfa were used as shown in table s1 the quantity of the carboxyl functional group decreases in the following order srnom srfa srha on the other hand the aromatic functional group decreases as follows srha srfa srnom driver and perdue 2014 ritchie and perdue 2003 during the photolysis of solutions containing 0 1 mm mncl2 10 mm borate buffer and 10 mgc l srha srfa or srnom the quantity of generated mn oxides decreased as srha srfa srnom as shown in fig 4a berg et al 2019 reported that a larger amount of oh was generated from aromatic and oxygenated dom while a smaller amount of 3dom and 1o2 were measured indicating that dom with greater amounts of aromatic functional groups promotes the charge transfer process berg et al 2019 as shown in fig 4c in addition compared with 3dom energy transfer dom charge transfer is dominant in o2 production le roux et al 2021 ma et al 2020 zhang and blough 2016 thus humic acid with a higher amount of aromatic functional groups than fulvic acid generated more o2 resulting in more mn oxidation as represented in fig 4a because ph did not change much during the mn oxidation fig 4b we excluded the possibility of ph variance as an explanation for the difference in the extent of mn oxidation 4 conclusions in this study we explored the abiotic mn oxidation pathways by examining the roles of dom and bromide ions in mn photochemical oxidation dom can act as an oxidative agent for mn2 aq oxidation processes during photolysis by producing o2 we found the solution ph influenced the formation of mn oxide solids during the photolysis of dom the oxidation processes were dominant at relatively high ph ph 7 5 0 1 however when ph became lower ph 7 5 0 1 reductive dissolution of mn oxide solids to mn2 aq was more favored when ph was maintained at 9 0 by ph buffer the generation of mn oxide solids kept increasing because the complex and various components of dom affected the mn oxidation processes various crystalline structures of mn oxide solids were observed which provides an improved understanding of diversity of natural mn oxide solids furthermore this study enables a deeper understanding of the impacts of br and reactive br radicals on photochemical mn oxidation processes in the presence of organic matter in the addition of br br radicals can be formed which further promoted mn oxidation the coeffect of br and natural organic compounds on mn oxidation in this study emphasizes the unforeseen impact of reactive oxygen and halogen radicals and predicts their reactions with heavy metal ions e g fe2 as3
